1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Marine birds and marine mammals are important 
components of the North Pacific ecosystem.  The 
amount of food consumed by marine birds and 
mammals can be considerable.  In some areas, the 
prey of marine birds and mammals are important 
commercial species or are important prey for 
harvested species, so t here can be conflicts 
between human and bird/mammal use of 
resources.  Declines in some mammal and bird 
populations have raised concerns about possible 
competition with commercial fisheries.  Because 
of the importance that marine birds and mammals 
have in the North Pacific, it is important to bring 
together and summarize available information on 
the food habits and consumption by these 
important predators in order to understand their 
role in the ecosystem. 
 
To make comparisons and summarizations easier 
and more comprehensible, the PICES region 
(30°N to the Bering Strait) was subdivided into 
regions based on oceanographic domains (Fig. 1).  
These regions varied in size from about 7 million 
km
2
 to over 100 million km
2
.  The quality and 
quantity of information was not uniform across the 
regions, making comparisons difficult. 
 
At least 47 marine mammal species and 135 sea 
bird species inhabit the PICES region.  Estimates 
of abundance exceed 10,000,000 marine mammals 
and 200,000,000 marine birds.  Seabirds and 
marine mammals are widely distributed 
throughout the PICES region.  The mean size of 
individuals ranges from 28 kg to over 100,000 kg 
for marine mammals and from 20 g to 8,000+g for 
marine birds.

1.1 Marine Birds 
Marine birds occur throughout the PICES region, 
throughout the year.  Many species that breed in 
the South Pacific migrate to the North Pacific to 
forage in summer.  This is in contrast to marine 
mammals that do not make seasonal migrations 
across the equator.  Because of these migrations, 
estimates of abundance and food consumption 
were limited to the summer months (June-
August/September). 
 
As with marine mammals, most marine birds are 
opportunistic feeders rather than prey specialists.  
The principal foods are small schooling f ishes, 
squids and crustaceans that occur in large swarms.  
Many species feed across two or three trophic 
levels, including scavengers. 
 
The birds included in this paper include 
albatrosses, shearwaters and their allies, pelicans 
and their allies, and phalaropes, skuas, gulls, terns 
and auks, all of which forage in the water column 
rather than on the benthos.  Estimates of 
abundance in the sub-regions were derived from a 
combination of shipboard and aerial surveys and 
colony counts, depending on the available 
information and behavior of the species (see 
Appendix 6).  Adjustments were made by region 
to fit the limitations of the available data. Species 
densities varied from 1 - 38 birds•km
-2
 in the 
Eastern Transition Zone and coastal Gulf of 
Alaska, respectively. 
 
Appendix 7 is a compilation of the available 
information on the diets of marine birds in the 
PICES region.  The data are from a variety of 
sources (e.g. stomach samples, regurgitations at 
roosts), all of which have certain limitations. 
Indices of the relative importance of prey types 
were developed to take account of the relative rate 
of occurrence in individuals, the percent presence 
in terms of biomass and in terms of relative 
number of items in stomachs.  Within the 
zooplankton, euphausiids are the most important 
prey in most areas.  Small cephalopods are 
generally more important than large cephalopods.  
The variation in type of fish eaten appears greater 
on the N-S axis than between E-W regions of the 
Pacific. 
 
Metabolic rates in birds vary with body mass to a 
power between 0.6 and 0.8 since metabolic 
activity per gram is greater in small than large 
birds.  Therefore, to estimate energy require-ments 
of a community of birds, the energetic 
requirements of each species must be determined 
individually.  Daily energy requirements of 
individual birds were estimated using the 
allometric equation of Birt-Friesen.  This 
calculates energy requirements as a function of 
body mass, which was derived from the literature.  
Energy demand for marine birds in a given area is 
a function of the biomass of birds present and can 
be estimated even when diets are not known. 
 
Energy density of prey varies with taxon, within 
prey taxa and with condition of the individual prey 
item.  The ability of marine birds to assimilate 
energy from the prey varies with nutritional state, 
food types and with the amount of lipid in the 
food.  Assimilation efficiencies vary from about 
70-80% in marine birds. 
 
The number of species and predominant size class 
varies by sub-region.  The fewest number of 
species (24) occurs in the Eastern Sub-Arctic, 
while the largest number is in the Kuroshio/ 
Oyashio Current sub-region (61 species).  In 
general, the western Pacific sub-regions have a 
higher species richness than the eastern North 
Pacific but the difference is only about 10%.  
Birds of larger body mass (>1000 g) predominate 
in the Bering Sea and California Current sub-
regions (murres, puffins and shearwaters).  Most 
of these species forage in the upper water column 
for small fish or macrozooplankton.  Small marine 
bird species (<125 g) predominate in the Eastern 
and Western Sub-Arctic, and Eastern and Western 
Transition sub-regions (storm petrels).  These 
smaller birds forage at the water’s surface, 
consuming mainly neuston and micronecton (see 
Appendix 7). 
 
Reasonably complete estimates of summer prey 
consumption by marine birds during summer 
(June-August, 92 days) were developed for six of 
the PICES sub-regions (Table 6).  Zooplankton 
were important in Bering Sea and coastal Gulf of 
Alaska;  fish are important in most other areas and 
cephalopods were important in the Transition 
Zone.

1.2 Marine Mammals 
Understanding marine mammal effects in the 
ecosystem are complicated by the nature of their 
life history:  marine mammals generally are 
opportunistic feeders and consume a wide variety 
of prey within a specified size range.  Because of 
the complex life history, different prey species and 
sizes are eaten by different life stages.  For 
example in some cetacean species, young may 
continue to feed on milk for a year or more.  
Energetic demands also vary with life stage and 
with time of year:  for example during their long 
migrations, large whales stop or greatly reduce 
their feeding.  Finally, obtaining data on prey 
consumption and energetic demands is difficult 
due to restrictions in many areas from killing 
mammals for such studies and due to their 
underwater feeding.  Some feed as deep as 3000 m. 
 
Prey vary from plankton and benthic invertebrates 
to larger fish and squid and can include seabirds, 
other mammals and turtles. Small or juvenile fish 
and squid are frequent prey items.  Even in the 
baleen whales (Mysticetes), prey varies from 
plankton to small schooling fish.  Prey species are 
a function of the region and time of year and 
generally reflect the more abundant species. 
 
There are few studies of the amount of food 
consumed by marine mammal species.  Pinnipeds 
in the Gulf of Alaska were estimated to consume 
as much as 617,000 metric tons of prey annually.  
Similar data for other species are scarce. 
 
There are large data gaps in information on 
abundance, seasonal distributions, migration 
patterns, regional prey selection, and energetic 
requirements for marine mammal species and life 
stages.  Little is known on the energetic content of 
their prey.  Therefore this report focuses on 
presenting the limited data available in tables, 
emphasizing the western Pacific area as an 
example of the difficulties in determining the total 
consumption and effects of marine mammals on 
prey resources.  Summary tables describing 
marine mammal distribution, abundance, biomass, 
prey and energetic requirements (Tables 9 -14) 
were developed from the detailed information, by 
region, that are reported in Appendices 9 -11.  
Although both the marine mammal and the marine 
bird sections of the report dealt with the summer 
season, because of logistical problems with the 
data and calculations, there was some 
inconsistency between the two groups in 
determining the length of the summer seaon. 
 
Abundance:  Generally, abundance estimates are 
not for each specific PICES sub-region, as there 
are often seasonal or frequent movements between 
areas.  In addition, the amount of data for esti-
mating abundance is often low and therefore the 
estimates have wide confidence intervals.  The 
difficulty of sighting marine mammals at sea also 
results in rather poor estimates of abundance. 
 
Diets:  Diets vary by sex, age, reproductive 
condition, time and foraging location.  Therefore 
prey values used in estimating consumption were 
derived as generalized approximations of food 
habits.  Finally, the energy requirements are 
difficult to measure directly and vary with age/size 
of the predator.  Therefore we used a generalized 
formula to calculate energy requirement based on 
food consumption and body weight.  
 
Prey consumption:  We have developed 
quantitative estimates for the eight PICES sub-
regions (Table 14) while no estimates are available 
in the other six sub-regions.  With pooling 
available estimates of all 8 sub-regions 
(corresponding to approximately 49% of the total 
PICES region), total prey consumption is 
estimated to be 13,019,000 tonnes during summer 
(June-September, 122 days) per year.  But 
obviously this figure is an extreme under-
representation of total summer prey consumption 
by marine mammals in the PICES region due to 
lack of estimates in almost half of the PICES sub-
regions and conservative population abundance 
estimates.  Thus, it is still premature to give 
quantitative estimates of the total prey 
consumption by marine mammals. 
 
1.3 General Remarks 
For both marine birds and mammals, there are a 
number of confounding factors in estimating levels 
of prey consumption.  The greatest sources of 
error are the lack of good estimates of population 
abundance and good information on diet 
 
 
 
4
composition over time and area.  Thorough, well-
designed surveys of at-sea distributions and 
abundances of marine birds and mammals are 
needed throughout the PICES region, and 
throughout all seasons if we are to understand the 
role these species play in the ecosystem.  Survey 
coverage has been very low, for marine birds with 
generally less than two percent of the any sub-
region covered.  Most of the survey work has been 
in summer months, resulting in little information 
on abundance, distribution or food habits for other 
parts of the year. 
 
The information summarized in this report 
indicates how PICES sub-regions vary in 
biomass/abundance of marine birds and mammals 
during summer months, and how the trophic 
pathways vary by sub-region.  The estimates of 
total prey consumed are conservative because of 
the limited amount of information on abundance 
and/or diet.  The data suggest a striking difference 
in productivity of waters in the eastern and 
western North Pacific and between the shelf and 
oceanic areas. 
 
This report compiles available information on both 
marine bird and mammal distributions, abundance, 
food habits and prey consumption throughout the 
PICES region.  It illustrates the large data gaps in 
our knowledge of these predators, particularly in 
quantitative estimates of abundance and f ood 
habits.  Since the estimates of consumption are 
only for summer and are so data poor, the resulting 
estimates of total consumption and effects on the 
ecosystem are conservative.  Hopefully, through 
the combined efforts of the PICES community, at 
least some of theses data gaps will be filled and we 
will develop a better understanding of the role of 
marine mammals and birds in the North Pacific 
ecosystem.

To evaluate the effects of predation by marine 
birds and mammals on intermediate and lower 
trophic levels of subarctic Pacific marine 
ecosystems, Working Group 11 will: 
 
1. Obtain and tabulate a vailable data on 
population sizes and prey consumption by 
marine birds and mammals; 
2. Calculate seasonal and annual consumption, 
expressed as numbers and biomass, of 
particular marine resource species by 
particular bird and mammal populations; 
3. Where possible, stratify the calculation as to 
age classes of prey and locality (local stock 
impacted); 
4. Prepare a report for PICES describing data 
sources and methods of calculation, and the 
results, and identifying major lacunae in 
knowledge. 
 
2.3 Overview 
Marine mammals a nd birds are highly visible 
components of marine ecosystems.  In many cases, 
the principal prey of marine mammals and marine 
birds consists of species of fish or zooplankton 
which are harvested in commercial fisheries, or 
which are the prey of harvested species.  The 
interactions between marine mammals or marine 
birds and fisheries can be negative when the 
fisheries remove potential prey, particularly in the 
case of industrial fisheries that target small, oil-
rich fish species (Schaefer, 1970; Furness, 1984b, 
1987; Burger & Cooper, 1984; Monaghan, 1992) 
or positive, when offal and discards are made 
available to scavenging animals (Camphuysen et 
al., 1993; Furness et al., 1992; Gould et al., 
1997a) or when the removal of large, predatory 
fish species results in an increased abundance of 
forage fish (Springer, 1992).  Thus, in recent years 
some multi-species models of fisheries 
interactions have attempted to account for 
consumption by marine birds and mammals 
(Croxall, 1989; Anon., 1991; Rice, 1992).  In the 
North Pacific Ocean, recent declines in the 
abundance of certain species of marine mammals 
and marine birds have raised concern about the 
possibility that competition with commercial 
fisheries may be in part responsible for these 
declines (Bailey, 1989; Anon., 1993; NRC, 1996; 
Trites et al., 1997, 1999), although other work 
suggests a major role for climate change (Springer, 
1998). 
 
2.4 Division of North Pacific into Sub-
regions 
As a first step in developing this report, the 
members of Working Group 11 divided the PICES 
region of interest (the North Pacific Ocean from 
30  N to the Bering Strait), into manageable sub-
regions that corresponded roughly to 
oceanographic domains (Fig. 1, Table 1).  This 
task was essential not only because it facilitated 
comparisons between different sub-regions, but 
also because the amount of survey coverage and 
diet information varied greatly between sub-
regions.  The sub-regions were chosen so that they 
had physical and biological cohesion.  The 
seaward extent of coastal sub-regions was defined 
as 100 km seaward of the 2000 m depth contour.  
Exceptions are the western Bering Sea and basin 
sub-region (BSP), the Sea of Okhotsk (OKH), the 
Sea of Japan (SJP), and the East China Sea (ECS), 
all of which include both continental shelf and 
deep basin areas.  The size of sub-regions varies 
from 111,570 km
2
 in the Kamchatka Current and 
Kurile Islands (KM/KL) to 7,808,530 km
2
 in the 
Eastern Transition Zone (ETZ) (Table 1).

2.5 Limitations on temporal coverage 
Because of a lack of data obtained from f all, 
winter and spring, the Working Group decided that 
its analyses would be restricted to the summer 
months of June, July and August (and September 
for marine mammals) when most species of 
marine mammals and birds have completed their 
migrations into the study area and are resident 
there.  Thus we tried to calculate prey 
consumption and energy requirements on a “by 
summer” basis, but it was necessary to use 
different durations for each group:  June-August 
(92 days) for marine birds and June-September 
(122 days) for marine mammals.  We recognize 
that this treatment does not capture the seasonal 
fluxes of marine mammals and marine birds into 
or out of the study area, or the very different prey 
consumption rates of these predators in winter, 
when many individuals shift from northerly 
regions to more temperate waters in the North 
Pacific Ocean, or are absent from the North 
Pacific altogether.  The normal, periodic foraging 
movements across the boundaries of the sub-
regions are also not captured.

3 FOOD CONSUMPTION BY MARINE BIRDS IN THE NORTH 
PACIFIC OCEAN 
 
3.1 Introduction 
More than 135 species of marine birds (>195 if 
loons, grebes and waterfowl are included) occupy 
marine habitats throughout the North Pacific 
Ocean (Appendix 2).  Their total numbers may 
well exceed 200,000,000.  They range in weight 
from the 20 g least storm-petrel ( Oceanodroma 
microsoma) to the >8,000 g short-tailed albatross 
(Phoebastria albatrus).  Marine birds occur 
throughout the area and throughout the year.  Most 
breed during the boreal summer, although some of 
the warmer-water species breed during the boreal 
winter.  Many species that breed in the South 
Pacific during the austral summer migrate into the 
North Pacific to forage during the boreal summer.  
 
Although many marine bird species s how 
preferences for one or a few specific prey items, 
most species have a tendency toward opportunism.  
Almost any prey that can be seen, caught and 
swallowed is eaten (Appendix 3).  Prey as small as 
1 mm and as large as can fit within the bill and be 
swallowed are taken whole.  Larger prey are 
shredded before consumption.  Principal foods 
tend to be small schooling fishes, squids and 
crustaceans that congregate in large swarms (e.g., 
capelin (Mallotus villosus), market squid ( Loligo 
opalescens), and euphausiids ( e.g., Thysanoessa 
spp.).  Marine birds employ a wide variety of 
foraging and food capture techniques (Ashmole, 
1971).  Ogi (1984) added a foraging category he 
called "grazing" to describe the behavior of sooty 
shearwaters ( Puffinus griseus) when they are 
feeding on muscles and barnacles attached to 
floating debris.  Prey are captured above, on, and 
below the water’s surface.  Marine birds have been 
recorded diving to depths greater than 100 m (Piatt 
& Nettleship, 1985; Burger & Powell, 1990).  
Foraging and capture techniques (influenced by 
morphological characters) may be the principal 
determinants in diet composition, and variations in 
them allow for high species richness within marine 
bird communities.  
Marine birds are primarily secondary and tertiary 
carnivores as well as scavengers within marine 
ecosystems.  Trophic structures for the North 
Pacific (Appendix 4) have been described by 
several authors.  Parrin (1968) and Pearcy (1991) 
did not include marine birds and mammals in their 
models of North Pacific marine food webs.  In 
contrast, Brodeur (1988) included birds and 
mammals but lumped them all together at a single 
trophic level (level 7).  Others have focused on the 
trophic relations of marine birds ( e.g., Ainley & 
Sanger, 1979; Schneider & Shuntov, 1993; 
Hobson et al., 1994; Sydeman et al., 1997).  
Recent studies (Sanger, 1987a; Gould et al., 
1997a,b,c,d, 1998b) indicate that many marine 
bird species feed across two or three trophic 
levels.  For example, Gould et al. (1997a) found 
that Laysan a lbatross ( Phoebastria immutabilis) 
primarily eat small fish and squid, but will 
occasionally capture small invertebrates and 
scavenge large birds and mammals, thus feeding 
across three trophic levels.  Likewise, short-tailed 
shearwaters  (Puffinus tenuirostris) take a wide 
variety of prey from zooplankton to small fish and 
squid, thus spanning several trophic levels (Ogi et 
al., 1980; Vermeer, 1992).  In other cases, 
superficially similar species of marine birds forage 
at different trophic levels.  Thus, Sanger (1987a) 
found that in the Gulf of Alaska, short-tailed 
shearwaters feed one trophic level below the 
closely related and morphologically similar sooty 
shearwaters.   
 
The amount of food consumed by marine birds, 
and thus their trophic impact on marine 
ecosystems, can be considerable (Furness 1984a, 
1987; Furness & Cooper, 1982; Duffy et al., 1987; 
Bailey et al., 1991).  A recent summary of 
research on the prey demands of marine birds in 
the North Sea provided a useful overview of 
methods of modeling the trophic impact of marine 
birds (Anon., 1994).  In the North Pacific, there 
are studies of marine bird trophic demand from 
southern California (Briggs & Chu, 1987), the 
Oregon coast (Wiens & Scott, 1975), the Gulf of 
Alaska (Degange & Sanger, 1987), the Bering Sea 
(Hunt et al., 1981; Schneider & Hunt, 1982; 
Schneider et al., 1986), and the Chukchi Sea 
(Swartz, 1966).  Wiens and Scott (1975) estimated 
the annual consumption of prey by four species of 
marine birds along the coast of Oregon: sooty 
 
 
 
8
shearwater ( 30,717 mt), Leach's storm-petrel 
(Oceanodroma leucorhoa) (9,412 mt), Brandt's 
cormorant ( Phalacrocorax penicillatus) (1,291 
mt), and common murre (Uria aalge) (21,142 mt) 
for a total of 62,562 mt of which about 35,800 mt 
is consumed during the breeding season.  Vermeer 
and Devito (1986) calculated that the nesting 
population of rhinoceros auklet ( Cerorhinca 
monocerata) in the eastern North Pacific would 
receive 326 m t of food over a single breeding 
season.  Degange and Sanger (1986) estimated that 
the biomass of prey consumed by marine birds in 
the Gulf of Alaska (excluding waterfowl, loons, 
grebes and shorebirds) was ~18 kg•km
-2
•day
-1
 
over the continental shelf and ~2.4 kg•km
-2
•day

over oceanic waters.  Swartz (1966) estimated that 
13 breeding s pecies (421,000 individuals) 
consumed 13,100 mt of food during four months 
at Cape Thompson, Alaska. 
 
3.2 Methods 
3.2.1 Defining marine bird stocks and 
populations 
At present, it is difficult to define populations and 
stocks for the species of marine birds that frequent 
the North Pacific Ocean.  For the transequatorial 
migrants, we know the region where they nest, but 
have no information on whether the birds from 
different parts of the nesting range or from 
different colonies co-mingle when on migration or 
when in the Northern Hemisphere.  When 
considering species that nest in the North Pacific, 
we have almost no information on the extent to 
which individuals from different colonies mingle 
on the foraging grounds.  Likewise, the extent of 
exchange of breeding adults b etween colonies 
from one year to the next remains unstudied, and 
we do not know whether the birds associated with 
a particular colony should be considered as a 
discrete stock.  Evidence is accumulating that 
parameters of reproductive effort may vary 
synchronously on an interannual basis, very 
possibly because the birds share a common prey 
stock (Hatch et al., 1993; Furness et al., 1996; 
Hunt & Byrd, 1999).  However, the population 
sizes of marine bird species nesting on different 
colonies usually do not show synchronous changes 
over time, and we often assume that the population 
dynamics of different colonies are not coupled.  
Thus the birds within a colony appear to be acting 
as if they are a separate stock. 
 
To focus on marine birds that forage primarily in 
the water column, rather than on benthos, we 
consider here only the albatrosses, shearwaters and 
their allies, (Procellariiformes), pelicans and their 
allies (Pelecaniformes), and phalaropes, skuas, 
gulls, terns and auks (Charadriiformes).  Other 
birds are important predators in marine habitats, 
especially nearshore, but are beyond the scope of 
our report.  These include loons (Gaviiformes), 
grebes (Podicipediformes), shorebirds 
(Charadriiformes) and waterfowl (Anseriformes).  
For example, Vermeer and Ydenberg (1989) 
estimated that from September through May, 
Barrow’s goldeneye ( Bucephala islandica) and 
surf scoter ( Melanitta perspicillata) together 
consumed >164,000 kg of blue mussels (Mytilus 
edulis) in Jervis Inlet (area of about 177 km
2
), 
Canada. 
 
3.2.2 Marine bird abundance 
Few marine bird population sizes have been 
estimated on a world-wide or even ocean-wide 
basis (Croxall et al., 1984).  We derived estimates 
of abundance for marine birds in the PICES sub-
regions from a combination of shipboard and 
aerial s urveys and colony counts.  Abundances 
based on shipboard or aerial surveys (birds km
-2
) 
were used in preference to colony counts because 
they include sub-adult and non-breeding adult 
portions of the populations not present at the 
colonies.  For wide ranging species that could be 
encountered at sea, the shipboard surveys sufficed.  
For species that are strongly attracted to ships, 
thereby artificially inflating their apparent 
abundance, and for species with highly clumped 
distributions that tend to bias population estimates, 
and for species which appear infrequently in 
surveyed waters, we depended on colony counts, 
or on estimates of the world population size, 
adjusted for the proportion present in each of the 
PICES sub-regions (Appendices 5 and 6). 
 
Where available, we used the shipboard survey 
data stored in the ACCESS database by the U.S. 
Geological Survey, Alaska Biological Research 
Center, Anchorage, Alaska (Table 1).  The 
coverage within this database is poor for both 
 
 
 
9
CAN and CAS sub-regions; consequently we 
treated those two regions differently.  In the CAN 
sub-region, we used data from shipboard surveys 
conducted by the Canadian Wildlife Service 
between 1988 and 1998 (K. Morgan, unpubl. 
data).  The CWS surveys under-sampled coastal 
areas of CAN, and we used colony data for the 
three cormorant species found there (Rodway, 
1991). 
 
Deriving population estimates for CAS was 
somewhat more complex.  As we did not have 
access to recent at-sea abundance estimates for the 
entire sub-region, we used the mean species 
density values from Washington and Oregon 
northern California and southern California 
presented in Tyler et al. (1993).  Those density 
estimates were derived from a combination of 
aerial and vessel surveys.  Thus, the CAS 
shipboard survey effort and extent of coverage are 
not clear.  Where at-sea estimates were not 
reported for a species, we used colony data (Tyler 
et al., 1993). 
 
In the ETZ and Western Transition Zone (WTZ) 
we used unpublished surveys by P. Gould.  Colony 
counts in the BSP, the eastern Bering Sea (BSC) 
and the coastal Gulf of Alaska (ASK) regions are 
from the colony catalog maintained by the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, Anchorage, Alaska 
(Sowls et al., 1978).   
 
For most marine bird species, shipboard surveys 
were used directly by multiplying the number of 
birds•km
-2 
 by the area (km
2
) of the sub-region 
(Method "S" in Appendix 6, Tables 6.1 - 6.14).  
For two species of albatross, three species of 
shearwater and for northern fulmars, which are 
attracted to ships or contagiously distributed, we 
assumed that the ratios of the densities of each of 
these species across PICES sub-regions 
represented the proportion of the North Pacific 
population of each species in each sub-region.  
Therefore, to obtain the number of individuals of a 
species i n each sub-region, we multiplied the 
proportions of each species seen in a sub-region by 
the estimated population for the entire PICES 
region (Method “D” in Appendix 6, Tables 6.1 - 
6.14).  This procedure was modified for sooty and 
short-tailed shearwaters because most of the data 
for these two species were reported as "dark 
shearwaters" as they are difficult to distinguish.  
The density of dark shearwaters in each PICES 
region was partitioned into sooty and short-tailed 
shearwaters using data from the literature to 
estimate the ratio of one species to the other in 
each area and then using that ratio to separate the 
estimates of shearwater densities into the numbers 
of each species.  For the above calculations, we 
assumed the following total North Pacific 
abundances:  Laysan albatross (2,500,000), black-
footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes) (200,000), 
northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) (4,600,000), 
sooty shearwater (30,000,000), short-tailed 
shearwater (30,000,000), and Buller's shearwater 
(Puffinus bulleri) (2,500,000) (Appendix 5). 
 
The data used for most sub-regions originated 
from either the database maintained by the U.S. 
Geological Survey, or from P. Gould (unpubl. 
data).  Originally the USGS database was also 
used to estimate the proportions of the 6 ship-
attracted/clumped species for CAN.  However, as 
the coverage of CAN was so poor (only168 km
2
), 
we recalculated the proportions of those species 
for CAN using recent data (1988-1998) (K. 
Morgan, unpubl. data).  Thus, the population 
estimates for CAN for these 6 species presented in 
Appendix Tables 5.1-5.4 differ from those listed in 
Appendix Table 6.4.  The values in Appendix 
Tables 5.1-5.4 (Black-footed Albatross - 3,056.64, 
Laysan Albatross - 144.59, Sooty Shearwater - 
91,982.44, Short-tailed Shearwater - 10,540.31, 
Northern Fulmar - 436.59, Buller’s Shearwater - 
12,559.11) were derived from pre-1988 data.  The 
estimates presented in Table 6.4 were the result of 
more recent data used in the proportion 
calculations (Black-footed Albatross - 2,523.01, 
Laysan Albatross - 194.58, Sooty Shearwater - 
124,507.44, Short-tailed Shearwater - 14,258.09, 
Northern Fulmar - 6,547.11, Buller’s Shearwater - 
7,520.52).  No attempt was made to recalculate the 
estimated populations of those species in the other 
sub-regions; consequently, summing the 
populations across all sub-regions will not sum to 
the assumed North Pacific populations given 
above.

3.2.3 Distribution and seasonal movements of 
marine birds 
The principal breeding season for marine birds in 
the subarctic is May to September.  In subtropical 
waters, many species ( e.g., albatrosses) breed 
between November and May.  During the breeding 
season, many young birds either remain at-sea or 
visit the colonies only for short periods.  After 
breeding, some species disperse within the region 
of the colony, while others move to other areas.  
Southward transequatorial migrations primarily 
occur in September-November and northward 
migrations occur primarily in March-May.  
Occupancy along the migration routes is difficult 
to assess.  For areas at the northern terminus of a 
species’ migration, we assumed occupancy for the 
entire June-August period (92 days).  The 92-day 
occupancy period is also based on the fact that the 
densities of birds in PICES sub-regions are the 
average birds•km
-2
 for the entire June-August 
period. 
 
3.2.4 Marine bird diets used in the model 
We assembled the information available on the 
diets of marine birds in the PICES region 
(Appendix 7).  Information on marine bird diets is 
obtained from sampling the food brought to chicks 
at colonies, by examining the hard-to-digest parts 
of prey that birds regurgitate at roosts, by 
examining stomachs of birds caught as bycatch in 
fishing gear, and by shooting birds at sea to obtain 
samples of food from their stomachs.  The 
information available on diets carries a number of 
known biases.  Foods brought to chicks at colonies 
may differ from that taken by adults for their own 
consumption (e.g. Decker et al., 1995), hard parts 
found at roosts or in stomachs may be identifiable 
long a fter soft-bodied prey have been digested 
(Imber, 1973; Duffy & Laurenson, 1983; Furness 
et al., 1984), and birds caught in fishing gear or 
collected at sea may reflect local feeding 
opportunities rather than the broader spectrum of 
prey taken in the region as a whole (e.g., Gould et 
al., 1997a).  Indices of the relative importance of 
prey types (IRI) have been developed to consider 
the relative rate of occurrence in individuals, the 
percent presence in terms of biomass, and in terms 
of the relative numbers of items in stomachs (e.g., 
Pinkas et al., 1971; Duffy & Jackson, 1986; Day 
& Byrd, 1989; Gould et al., 1997a).  Percent mass 
or percent IRI was used to quantify diets whenever 
available.  In a few cases where this information 
was not available, we used percent numbers of 
individual prey items. 
 
3.2.5 Marine bird energy requirements 
Marine birds require high rates of energy 
consumption because they are endothermic and 
active.  Because heat loss in a small bird is 
proportionally greater than in a large-bodied bird, 
metabolic rates in birds scale with body mass to a 
power of between 0.6 and 0.8, such that metabolic 
activity per gram is larger in a small bird than in a 
large one.  Thus, when estimating the energy 
requirements of a community of birds, it is 
essential to determine the energetic requirements 
of each species individually (Furness, 1984a). 
 
Furness and Tasker (1996) have evaluated the 
methods available for estimating the energy 
requirements of a free-living marine bird 
community.  There are two approaches.  One 
approach involves the use of allometric equations 
to estimate the energy consumption of species 
whose energy requirements may never have been 
measured directly.  This method depends upon the 
extrapolation of values obtained in the laboratory, 
adjusted for activity levels.  This method requires 
estimates of the costs of various activities, and 
detailed, time-consuming field estimates of the 
amount of time devoted to each of these activities.  
The data necessary to apply this approach to the 
marine birds of the North Pacific are not available. 
 
Alternatively, one can measure the turnover of 
isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in free-living 
birds to assess energy expenditure over the period 
between release and recapture of an individual 
(Nagy, 1980, 1987).  However, the application of 
this method is expensive and often difficult if 
nesting birds are not readily available.  There are 
few species of North Pacific marine birds for 
which isotopic determination of energy 
requirements are available. 
 
A third approach is to use allometric equations, 
developed from laboratory and field studies of a 
limited number of species, to estimate the likely 
energy requirements of birds of a given size (Birt-
Friesen et al., 1989).  In this report, we estimated 
 
 
 
11
the daily energy requirements of individual birds 
by using the allometric equation of Birt-Friesen et 
al. (1989) that predicts energy requirements as a 
function of body mass: 
 
log Y = 3.24 + 0.727 log M 
 
where Y= daily energy requirements is in kj, and 
M= mass in kg (Birt-Friesen et al., 1989).  Data on 
the mean body mass of marine bird species that 
occur in the North Pacific were obtained from the 
literature (Dunning, 1993).  Where separate values 
for each sex were given, we used the mean value 
to represent the species. 
 
3.2.6 Energy content of marine bird prey 
The energy density of marine bird prey varies with 
prey taxon, within prey taxa, and with the 
condition of the individual prey item (e.g., Harris 
& Hislop, 1978; Hudson, 1986; Croxall et al., 
1991; Camphuysen et al., 1993).  There is no 
single source of data for the energy density of the 
multitude of prey types taken by marine birds in 
the North Pacific, or even for any one sub-region 
of the PICES region (see Furness & Tasker, 1996).  
For this report, we obtained or adapted values of 
prey energy density from: Hunt (1972), Dunn 
(1973, 1979), Sidwell (1981), Vermeer and Cullen 
(1982), Ford et al. (1982), Montevecchi and Piatt 
(1984), Wacasey and Atkinson (1987), Vermeer 
and Devito (1986), Furness and Tasker (1996), 
and Van Pelt et al. (1997).  We used the following 
values for this exercise:  miscellaneous 
invertebrate, 4 kj•g
-1
; gelatinous zooplankton, 3 
kj•g
-1
; crustacean zooplankton, 4 kj•g
-1
; small 
cephalopod, 3.5 kj•g
-1
; large cephalopod 4 kj•g
-1
; 
fish (low energy density, e.g., cod [Gaddus spp.], 
rockfish, pollock), 3 kj•g
-1
; fish (medium energy 
density, e.g., capelin, sandlance [ Ammodytes 
hexapterus]), 5 kj•g
-1
; fish (high energy density, 
e.g., myctophids, herring [ Clupea spp.], saury 
[Cololabis saira]), 7 kj•g
-1
; birds and mammals, 7 
kj•g
-1
; carrion, offal and discards, 5 kj•g
-1
.  The 
values for energy density of prey will require 
revision as information on more North Pacific 
species becomes available. 
 
3.2.7 Food utilization efficiency of marine birds 
The ability of marine birds to assimilate energy 
from their prey varies with nutritional state, food 
type, and with the amount of lipid in the food, 
such that energy from fish with higher lipid 
content is assimilated more efficiently than energy 
from fish with lower lipid concentrations (Furness 
& Tasker, 1996).  Measured assimilation 
efficiencies of marine birds vary from 75 to 80% 
for fish, to about 70% for most other marine prey 
(Nagy et al., 1984; Jackson, 1986; Gabrielsen et 
al., 1987; Brown, 1989; Crawford et al., 1991).  
Similar to Furness and Tasker (1996), we have 
assumed an assimilation efficiency of 75% for the 
conversion of daily energy requirements to the 
amount of prey needed to meet those 
requirements.  The decision reflects the relatively 
narrow range of variation in a ssimilation 
efficiencies, and the much greater sources of error 
in other inputs to the model. 
 
3.3 Model output 
In Appendix 6 we present data on the abundance 
of marine birds, by sub-region, for the summer 
months of June through August.  We also provide 
an estimate of bird-occupancy days for each 
marine bird species occurring in a sub-region, and 
the calculated daily energy requirements of an 
individual of each species.  Information was not 
available that would allow estimates of the annual 
energy requirements of marine birds in the 
subarctic North Pacific.  For most sub-regions, 
there were few data on the abundance of birds in 
spring or autumn, and virtually no information on 
the distribution and abundance of marine birds in 
winter.   
 
The number of marine bird species reported from a 
sub-region varies from as few as 24 species in the 
Eastern Sub-Arctic (ESA), to a maximum of 61 
species in the Kuroshio/Oyashio Current (KR/OY) 
sub-region (Table 2).  The uncertainty in the 
number of species frequenting an area is the result 
of insufficient coverage of vast areas of ocean, and 
the propensity of seabirds to wander widely over 
the ocean.  On average, sub-regions in the western 
Pacific Ocean support a greater richness of species 
than those in the eastern North Pacific, but the 
difference is only about 10 percent. 
 
The predominant size-class of marine bird varies 
among regions (Table 3), and this variation is 
reflected in the dominant groups of marine birds 
 
 
 
12
present in the western and eastern North Pacific 
(Table 4).  Marine birds larger than 1000 g are rare 
in all regions, but birds with body masses between 
401 and 1000 g predominate in the BSC, BSP, 
ASK, CAN and CAS.  Common species in this 
grouping include the murres ( Uria spp.), puffins 
(Fratercula spp), and the shearwaters ( Puffinus 
spp.).  Most of these species forage in the upper 
water column for small fish or macrozooplankton.  
Species less than 125 g dominate the ESA, 
Western Sub-Arctic (WSA), ETZ and WTZ.  In 
the eastern and western subarctic gyres and in the 
transition zones, storm-petrels ( Oceanodroma 
spp.) are the most abundant species of marine 
birds (Appendix Tables 6.5, 6.6, 6.10, 6.11), with 
many more found in the western Pacific than in 
the East (Table 4).  Storm-petrels, and phalaropes 
(Phalaropus spp.), which are particularly abundant 
in the ETZ (Table 4), forage at the water’s surface.  
Both species groups consume neuston or micro-
necton attracted to the neuston, and storm-petrels 
also feed on small fish and squid up to 74 mm in 
length (see Appendix Tables 7.1, 7.3, and 7.4).  
Many of the largest species of marine birds (e.g., 
cormorants, pelicans and gulls) occupy shelf and 
inshore habitats, whereas many of the smallest 
species are found primarily over deep, oceanic 
waters ( e.g., storm-petrels and phalaropes).  
However, because several of the sub-regions 
contain both shelf and deepwater habitats, it is 
difficult to determine the relationship of bird size 
and habitat depth from Table 4. 
 
The density of marine birds in the sub-regions 
varies from 38 birds•km
-2
 in the ASK sub-region 
to 1.0 birds•km
-2
 in the ETZ (Table 2).  In the 
Bering Sea, densities are higher in the east than in 
the west (BSC= 34 birds•km
-2
 vs. BSP = 16 
birds•km
-2
).  Although coverage of the western 
Bering Sea, in particular the shelf portions, is 
relatively poor and may not reflect the true 
abundance of marine birds in this region, the 
difference in density of marine birds between the 
BSC and the BSP most likely reflects the large 
proportion of shelf area in the BSC when 
compared to the BSP.  South of the Bering Sea, 
the coastal ASK sub-region supports in excess of 
10 birds•km
-2
.  The coastal sub-regions (KM/KL, 
KR/OY) in the western Pacific appear to support 
lower densities of marine birds, however, few 
surveys of these regions have been published, and 
the density of marine birds may be 
underestimated.  In the more central sub-regions 
south of the Bering Sea, the density of marine 
birds appears greater in the western Pacific Ocean 
than in the east (WSA = 7 birds•km
-2
 vs. ESA = 
2•birds km
-2
, and WTZ = 9 birds•km
-2
 vs. ETZ = 
1.0 birds•km
-2
). 
 
Energy consumption by marine birds in a given 
area is a function of the biomass of birds present, 
and can be estimated even when diets are not 
known.  Among the sub-regions, energy 
consumption by marine birds varies from 0.8 · 10
3 
kJ•km
-2
•d
-1
 in the ETZ sub-region to 56.2 · 10
3 
kJ•km
-2
•d
-1
 in the ASK sub-region (Table 2).  
South of the Bering Sea, energy consumption by 
marine birds is greatest in the ASK, and CAS.  In 
the Bering Sea, energy consumption by m arine 
birds is twice as great in the eastern sub-region as 
it is in the west.  In contrast, south of the Bering 
Sea, energy consumption by marine birds is three 
times greater in the western subarctic gyre than in 
the eastern subarctic, and more than 10 times 
greater in the WTZ than in the ETZ.  
 
In Appendix 7 we present data on the diets of 
marine birds within the PICES region, by sub-
region, during the summer months.  These values 
reflect the data available in the major reviews that 
have covered a broad range of species.  Many of 
these were completed in the late 1970s or early 
1980s.  In some cases new information suggests 
that diets have changed, at least locally ( e.g., 
Pribilof Islands: Decker et al., 1995; Hunt et al., 
1996b,c; Gulf of Alaska: Piatt & Anderson 1996), 
but in general, we do not have sufficient recent 
data to allow presentation of up-dated dietary 
information. 
 
The marine bird prey species or species groups of 
particular importance in each of the sub-regions 
are summarized in Table 5.  Within the 
zooplankton, euphausiids are likely the most 
important component of marine bird diets except 
in the ETZ and WTZ, where the goose barnacle, 
Lepus fascicularis, predominates in shearwater 
diets.  Likewise, in all areas other than the ETZ 
and WTZ, small cephalopods are more important 
than large species.  However, in the ETZ and 
WTZ, albatrosses make use of neon flying squid, 
Ommastrephes bartrami, at least some of the time 
 
 
 
13
taking squid caught in drift nets.  In the North 
Pacific Ocean, marine birds include in their diets a 
wide variety of fish, most of which are of medium 
to high energy density.  An exception is the use of 
walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), a fish 
of low energy density, in the eastern Bering Sea.  
Although the data are too sparse to make the 
generalization with confidence, the variation in the 
type of fish taken appears greater on the north-
south axis than between the east and west sides of 
the North Pacific. 
 
We were able to develop reasonably complete 
estimates for marine bird summertime (June-
August, 92 days) prey consumption in six sub-
regions of the PICES region for which we could 
account for much of the prey consumed (Table 6).  
Zooplankton were important in the BSC and ASK, 
fish were important in all areas other than the 
ETZ, and cephalopods were important in the ETZ 
and WTZ.  Data on prey types eaten in other 
regions were insufficient to develop meaningful 
estimates of total prey consumption. 
 
To provide a rough estimate of upper and lower 
bounds on the amounts of prey consumed by 
marine birds in each sub-region, we estimated prey 
consumption based on the seasonal energy 
demands of the marine bird communities assuming 
either that all prey were of the lowest energy 
density (3 kj•g
-1
) or of the highest energy density 
(7 kj•g
-1
) (Table 7).  The eastern Bering Sea and 
the Gulf of Alaska stand out as areas with high 
fluxes per unit area of marine life to marine birds.  
In contrast, the ESA and the ETZ have 
considerably lower fluxes per unit area to marine 
birds than most other sub-regions. 
 
3.4 Discussion of prey consumption by 
marine birds 
3.4.1 Reliability of estimates of prey 
consumption by marine birds 
A number of sources of error potentially affect the 
estimates of prey consumption by marine birds.  
These include the estimation of energy demand, 
diet composition, energy density of prey, and 
estimates of the distribution and abundances of 
marine bird populations.  Of these, the greatest 
sources of error almost certainly are in the 
estimates of the sizes of populations in the various 
sub-regions and in the estimates of diet 
composition.  Many of the data on diet 
composition and abundance of birds were gathered 
in the mid to late 1970s, when the possibility of 
offshore oil development spurred studies along the 
west coast of the United States, in Alaska, and 
along potential tanker routes from North America 
to Asia.  Since then, fewer large-scale studies have 
occurred, despite major changes in the marine 
ecosystems of the North Pacific Ocean (Venrick et 
al., 1987; Anon., 1993; Francis & Hare 1994; 
NRC, 1996; Brodeur et al., 1996; Mantua et al., 
1997; Springer, 1998).  These ecosystem shifts 
have resulted in changes in the populations of 
breeding birds ( e.g., Hunt & Byrd, 1999), their 
diets ( e.g., Decker et al., 1995; Hunt et al., 
1996b,c; Piatt & Anderson, 1996), and in the 
distribution and abundance of marine birds at sea 
(e.g., Viet et al., 1996).  Because recent survey 
data are generally lacking, in this report we have 
relied primarily on data from the 1970s and early 
1980s, except in CAN and CAS, where more 
recent surveys were available. 
 
The estimates of individual daily metabolic 
demand are the most robust of the parameters used 
to model marine bird prey demand.  These figures 
are based on well-accepted and tested allometric 
equations for energy requirements, and are 
unlikely to require major revision.  We have 
chosen to use equations from Brit-Friesen et al. 
(1989) that relies on regressions based on Daily 
Energy Expenditures, rather than on Basal 
Metabolic Rates multiplied by 4, as used by Anon. 
(1994).  Both methods have strengths and 
weaknesses (Anon. 1994), and we chose the use of 
allometric estimates of Daily Energy Expenditures 
as the most direct relationship with the fewest 
assumptions about the appropriate multiplier to be 
applied to basal metabolic rate estimates.  
Estimates from the two approaches vary only 
marginally, and whichever method was applied, it 
would not materially affect the estimates of prey 
consumption. 
 
Estimates of diet composition are based on several 
sources of data: collections of food samples made 
at colonies, investigations of the stomach contents 
of birds caught in drift nets, and samples from 
birds shot at sea.  Each method of sampling is 
subject to biases inherent in the foraging behavior 
 
 
 
14
and requirements of the birds sampled, and all 
methods reflect the composition of only the last 
few meals rather than a broad overview of the diet.  
These problems become particularly acute when 
sample sizes are small and collection sites and 
dates are limited in range.  Prey provided to chicks 
at a colony may differ from prey taken by 
breeding birds for their own consumption, or by 
non-breeding portions of the population.  Birds 
caught in drift nets may have been attracted to the 
nets by the opportunity to scavenge prey types not 
usually available to them, and may not represent 
the normal spectrum of prey taken by the 
population.  Finally, when birds are shot at sea 
while foraging, the prey contained may represent 
what was in a particular prey patch, rather that the 
full breadth of the diet. 
 
Estimates of the energy density or content of many 
of the species of prey taken by marine birds are 
unavailable.  For prey types that have been 
analyzed, evidence suggests considerable seasonal 
and spatial variation in energy density within a 
prey species  (e.g., capelin, Montevecchi & Piatt, 
1984; sandlance, Hislop et al., 1991).  
Inaccuracies in the values of energy density 
assigned to prey types used in our model could 
have a direct and marked effect on the estimates of 
the amount of a particular prey required to meet a 
bird’s energy requirements.  We provide the 
values of all parameters used in our model so that 
as better estimates of prey energy density become 
available, prey consumption estimates can be 
recalculated.  
 
Estimates of the sizes of populations of marine 
birds within the sub-regions are the most error-
prone parameters in the model.  Although for 
some species and in some regions, estimates of the 
numbers of adult birds attending colonies are 
fairly robust (particularly for surface- and cliff-
nesting species in the smaller colonies), for many 
species (particularly nocturnal, burrow-nesting 
species) and regions, estimates are weak or non-
existent.  Likewise, the percentages of populations 
that are subadult or non-breeding adults not 
attending colonies are almost universally poorly 
known.   
 
Population estimates based on at-sea surveys of 
birds are biased by a number of factors.  Only a 
minute fraction of the vast areas over which 
extrapolations must be made have been surveyed, 
the coverage in some regions is concentrated in 
commercial shipping lanes or zones of active 
fishing, and many aspects of the marine 
environment that may result in predictable 
concentrations of foraging birds have not been 
sampled in a way that would minimize bias.  There 
remains a great need for thorough, well-designed 
surveys of the at-sea distributions and abundances 
of marine birds throughout the PICES region. 
 
Only three PICES sub-regions (BSC, ASK, CAN) 
had >2% of the total area surveyed.  In all other 
sub-regions, the area covered was <0.5% of the 
sub-region.  Since many of the surveys involved 
repeated coverage of commercial shipping routes 
or surveys from vessels working in a restricted 
area, the geographic coverage of sub-regions was 
generally less than the number of square 
kilometers of survey coverage.   
 
The spatial distribution of coverage has a profound 
effect on the densities of birds encountered.  
Particularly in shelf regions and around islands 
and seamounts, evidence is accumulating that 
marine birds aggregate predictably at 
oceanographic features where prey concentrate 
(Hunt & Schneider, 1987; Hunt et al., 1993, 
1999).  Thus, if surveys are concentrated in these 
areas, or if they are under-sampled, bias will 
result.  In the database used for parameterizing the 
model, survey data are aggregated, and the 
coverage of coarse-scale features cannot be 
ascertained. 
 
The aggregation of survey data in the database 
also precludes determination of the effects of 
autocorrelation between subsequent transects 
along a survey line.  Spatial autocorrelation 
between samples is almost certain to be strong 
(Schneider, 1990), and results in a decrease in the 
effective sample size available for statistical 
evaluation of pattern.  Thus, our analyses in this 
report are presented without statistical evaluation 
of significance. 
 
Despite these difficulties in developing estimates 
of the model parameters, our results suggest some 
large-scale, robust patterns in the types and 
amounts of prey consumed in the PICES region of 
 
 
 
15
the North Pacific Ocean.  Our findings are in 
agreement with earlier, more qualitative studies, 
and give an indication of how sub-regions of the 
North Pacific differ in the biomass of marine birds 
supported and in the trophic pathways of 
importance.  For most sub-regions, our estimates 
of the total prey consumed are conservative 
because either the total number of birds present or 
their diets were unknown, and so those species 
were not represented in the estimates of 
consumption of particular prey types. 
 
3.4.2 Regional variation in numbers and 
biomass of marine birds supported 
Gould (1983) and Gould & Piatt (1993) suggested 
that there was a marked decline in the density of 
marine birds between the Subarctic Area 
(hundreds of birds•km
-2
) and the Transitional Zone 
(tens of birds•km
-2
).  In the present analysis, we 
found a marked decline in marine bird densities 
between the Bering Sea (16 – 34 birds•km
-2
) and 
the Subarctic Area (2 – 7 birds•km
-2
), but little 
change in the density between the Subarctic Area 
and the Transition Zone (1 – 9 birds•km
-2
).  The 
difference between the Bering Sea and the 
Subarctic Area most likely reflects both the greater 
productivity of the Bering Sea, particularly of its 
shelf areas, and also the importance of the 
availability of suitable nesting areas to support 
near-shore foraging alcids during the breeding 
season.  We do not know why we found little 
difference between the Subarctic Areas and 
Transition Zone compared to what Gould (1983) 
and Gould and Piatt (1993) found. 
 
There were also striking differences in the 
densities of birds between the western and eastern 
sides of the North Pacific.  The densities of marine 
birds in the western North Pacific subarctic were 3 
times greater than those in the Eastern Subarctic 
and 9 times greater in the Western Transition than 
in the Eastern Transition Zone (Tables 2, 4).  The 
ratio of biomass supported in the Western 
compared to the Eastern Subarctic Zone ( ~5 ·) 
and the Western versus Eastern Transition Zones 
(8 ·) were similar to the ratios of avian densities 
and reflected the contributions to biomass per unit 
area of large-bodied species such as albatrosses in 
the west.  These data suggest a striking difference 
in the productivity of waters in the eastern and 
western North Pacific (Sugimoto & Tadokoro, 
1997; Springer et al., 1999). 
 
The ratios of marine bird densities between the 
Western and Eastern Subarctic developed in this 
report are similar to those calculated by Springer 
et al. (1999) (3.3), who used the same database, 
but without modification (see Methods).  
However, the absolute values differ strikingly 
from those reported by Springer et al. (1999) 
because we adjusted overall numbers of ship-
attracted birds and those with highly clumped 
distributions to known maximum world or North 
Pacific population size.  Thus where Springer et 
al. (1999) estimated the mean density of birds•km
-
2
 in the Western Subarctic to be 24, we estimated 
the average density to be 7.  The ratios we found 
between west and east differ from those of Sanger 
and Ainley (1988), who divided the subarctic zone 
into western, central and Gulf of Alaska sections, 
with the Gulf of Alaska having the highest avian 
densities.  Wahl et al. (1989) compared bird 
densities in the western and eastern subarctic gyres 
and found marine bird densities 5 .8 · greater in 
the west. 
 
Both resident nesting species and transequatorial 
migrants that spend the boreal summer in the 
Northern Hemisphere contribute to the higher 
avian biomass in the western North Pacific Ocean 
(Table 4)(Springer et al., 1999).  Most 
importantly, sooty shearwaters, which spend the 
austral winter in the Northern Hemisphere and 
which are the dominant component of marine bird 
biomass in both the Subarctic and Transition 
Zones, are far more abundant in the western North 
Pacific (Table 8).  It is their abundance in the 
Western Transition Zone rather than in the 
Western Subarctic that makes sooty shearwaters 
the dominant presence in the western North 
Pacific.  In contrast, short-tailed shearwaters, 
though abundant in the Western Transition Zone, 
continue their migration eastward, with the bulk of 
their population spending the Summer in the 
eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska (Appendix 
5B). 
 
Springer et al. (1999) point out that northern 
fulmars, fork-tailed storm-petrels ( Oceanodroma 
furcata), least auklets (Aethia pusilla) and crested 
auklets (A. cristatella) nest in far greater numbers 
 
 
 
16
in the Western Subarctic, whereas common 
murres, ancient murrelets ( Synthliboramphus 
antiquum), Cassin’s auklets ( Ptychoramphus 
aleutica), rhinoceros auklets and horned puffins 
(Fratercula corniculata) have larger breeding 
populations in the Eastern Subarctic.  Our analyses 
do not show particularly high numbers of least and 
crested auklets in the Western Subarctic Area.  
The difference between the two analyses results 
from our inclusion of the marine bird colonies of 
the Aleutian Islands within the Bering Sea sub-
regions.  Many, if not most, of the auklets from 
these colonies forage to the north of the Aleutians 
in Bering Sea waters (Hunt et al., unpubl. data) 
and rarely, if ever, visit the Subarctic in summer.  
 
Throughout the North Pacific, it is the shelf 
regions that support the greatest densities of 
marine birds.  The eastern Bering Sea Shelf, and 
the Gulf of Alaska are both areas of exceptionally 
high densities of marine birds.  Thus, although the 
areas involved are not necessarily very large, it is 
these sub-regions that support the highest rates of 
energy flux to marine birds.  Gould (1983) found 
the highest densities of marine birds along the 
edge of the continental shelf in the vicinity of 54° 
to 55
o 
N.  Similarly, Sanger and Ainley (1988) 
pointed out that the density and biomass of marine 
birds in the oceanic portion of the Gulf of Alaska 
was only about one eighth those of the 
neighboring continental shelf.  To the southeast, 
Morgan et al. (1991) observed that the CAN shelf 
waters supported not only the highest density of 
marine birds, but the highest diversity as well.  As 
Springer et al. (1999) suggest, this concentration 
of marine birds along shelf edges and over shelf 
waters reflects the high rates of productivity in 
these regions (Parsons, 1986; Springer et al., 
1996). 
 
3.5 Regional variation in consumption by 
marine birds 
The greatest energy demand and prey consumption 
by marine birds occurs in the Western Transition 
Zone with a summer consumption of between 
712,341 mt and 1,662,130 mt.  However, the 
greatest flux to birds per unit area occurs in the 
shelf waters of the Gulf of Alaska where between 
0.74 and 1.72 mt•km
-2
 is consumed each summer 
(Table 7).   
 
3.5.1 Regional variation in marine bird diets 
The type of prey used by marine birds varied 
considerably between the sub-regions.  In the shelf 
waters of the eastern North Pacific Ocean, there is 
a suggestion of an increasing importance of fish 
and decreasing use of zooplankton as one goes 
from the Bering Sea in the north to the California 
Current South in the south.  In the eastern Bering 
Sea, prey consumption was almost evenly divided 
between crustacean zooplankters and fishes, with 
euphausiids (primarily taken by short-tailed 
shearwaters) and copepods (least auklets) being 
the most important zooplankton types; walleye 
pollock (murres and kittiwakes [ Rissa spp.]) was 
the most important fish.  In the Gulf of Alaska, 
euphausiids (short-tailed shearwaters), and to a 
lesser extent copepods (Cassin’s auklets), were the 
most important zooplankton consumed.  However, 
overall, fish were the most important prey type for 
marine birds (sooty shearwaters, short-tailed 
shearwaters and tufted puffins [ Fratercula 
cirrhata]), with capelin and sandlance being the 
most important prey species in the Gulf.  In the 
California Current North, off the west coast of 
Vancouver Island, the importance of fish to marine 
birds, listed as 70% in Table 6, may be under-
represented, as the contributions to fish 
consumption by sooty shearwaters and California 
Gulls ( Larus californicus) there were not 
accounted for. These two species represent 
approximately 20% of the marine bird population 
of CAN in summer.  In the California Current 
South, off C alifornia, Oregon and Washington, 
fish were the most important prey of marine birds, 
with common murres, sooty shearwaters and 
cormorants being the most important consumers.  
Surface-foraging western gulls ( Larus 
occidentalis) were also important fish consumers 
in this region.  The most important fish species 
was northern anchovy ( Engraulis mordax), 
followed by rockfish ( Sebastes spp.) of various 
species.  Zooplankton were, overall, a minor 
component of marine bird prey consumption. 
 
In the North Pacific Ocean, least and crested 
auklets specialize on copepods and euphausiids, 
respectively (Hunt et al., 1996c, 1998).  The 
nesting distributions of these marine birds are 
almost entirely restricted to the Bering Sea and the 
 
 
 
17
Sea of Okhotsk, and few individuals of these 
species nest south or east of the Aleutian Islands.  
In the Gulf of Alaska and south to Baja California, 
the dominant planktivorous alcid is the Cassin’s 
auklet, which takes large amounts of larval and 
juvenile fish in addition to euphausiids and 
copepods.  Cassin’s auklets, while often locally 
abundant, do not attain the vast numbers present in 
least and crested auklet colonies in the Bering Sea 
and the Sea of Okhotsk.  Populations of Cassin’s 
auklets have been shown to be sensitive to 
variations in the abundance of zooplankton 
(Ainley et al., 1990).  Off the west coast of 
Vancouver Island, Cassin’s auklets feed mostly on 
Neocalanus cristatus over the outer shelf in 
summer. However, as this zooplankter becomes 
scarce in surface waters in fall, Cassin’s auklets 
forage more in nearshore waters (Vermeer et al. 
1989).  The higher densities of zooplankton in the 
Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk than in the Gulf of 
Alaska and southward along the California coast 
suggest that the distribution patterns of these 
marine birds reflects the abundance of planktonic 
prey (Motoda & Minoda, 1974; Coyle et al., 1998; 
Roemmich & McGowan, 1995).  
 
The North Pacific Subarctic and Transition Zone 
regions pose particular difficulties for assessing 
marine bird diets.  There are no data on marine 
bird diets from the oceanic Eastern Subarctic, and 
all data from the Western Subarctic and the 
Transition Zones are from birds caught in gill nets.  
Thus, the sample of prey used is potentially biased 
because of the association with fishing activity and 
the subset of prey present in the fishing grounds.  
In their review, Springer et al. (1999) augmented 
the rather limited set of data from the gill net-
caught birds with information derived from colony 
studies in the Gulf of Alaska, Japan and Russia, 
and included material from Sanger and Ainley 
(1988) based on collections made in shelf waters 
of the Gulf of Alaska, primarily off Kodiak Island.  
We are hesitant to extrapolate from coastal and 
shelf waters to the subarctic gyre, as the prey base 
and the diets of the birds may differ significantly 
from the shelf region. 
 
In the absence of comparable diet data from the 
Eastern and Western Subarctic gyres, we can still 
obtain some idea of the foods used by examining 
the foraging behaviors and size classes of the 
marine birds inhabiting these regions.  Within the 
Western and Eastern Subarctic sub-regions, the 
mix of marine bird species is similar in the east 
and the west, with the exception that Laysan 
albatrosses are more abundant in the western 
subarctic and black-footed albatrosses are more 
abundant in the east.  Likewise, sooty and short-
tailed shearwaters were more abundant in the west, 
as were storm-petrels and phalaropes.  Farther 
south, in the Transition Zone, both Laysan and 
black-footed albatrosses take neon flying squid 
and offal associated with the high seas gillnet 
fishery for squid; when not associated with the 
squid fishery, Laysan albatrosses take fish, 
whereas black-footed albatrosses take squid 
(Gould et al., 1997a).  Sooty shearwaters, in the 
Western Subarctic forage primarily on fish, in 
particular Japanese sardine ( Sardinops 
melanostica, Shiomi & Ogi, 1992).  These data, at 
best very sparse, suggest that fish may be more 
important in the Western Subarctic, and squid in 
the east.  Both storm-petrels and phalaropes forage 
on neuston, and the abundance of these small 
marine birds in the Western Subarctic Area 
suggests that there, this layer of the ocean must 
support a great abundance of prey. 
 
Contrasts between the eastern and western North 
Pacific are much more striking in the Transition 
Zone than in the Subarctic (Table 4).  The Western 
Transition Zone is dominated by 20 million sooty 
shearwaters, 2.4 million Buller’s shearwaters, 29 
million Leach’s storm-petrels, and 2.6 million 
fork-tailed storm-petrels.  In contrast to the 
Subarctic, gulls and allies and phalaropes were 
more abundant in the Eastern Transition Zone than 
the west.  The high numbers of storm-petrels in the 
Western Transition Zone again emphasizes the 
importance of neuston in this region. 
 
Diet data are more abundant from the Transition 
Zones than from the Subarctic, and they indicate 
that marine birds in the Western Transition Zone 
depend primarily on fish, whereas, in the Eastern 
Transition Zone cephalopods are of primary 
importance.  These data are, however, distorted by 
the sampling of birds caught in the high-seas 
driftnet fisheries.  When the contributions of neon 
flying squid and Pacific pomfret (Brama japonica) 
were excluded from the analysis (because they 
were most likely scavenged from the fishery), 
 
 
 
18
small cephalopods and fish were of greater 
importance in the Western Transition Zone and 
barnacles and to a much lesser extent pelagic 
snails were of greater importance in the eastern 
Transition Zone.  Barnacles were the single most 
important food of sooty and short-tailed 
shearwaters in the Transition Zone as a whole, and 
fishes were of secondary importance (Gould et al., 
unpubl. ms).  There was also a shift from the use 
of barnacles in the southern latitudes (38 to 41°N) 
to fish and cephalopods toward the north (42 to 
45°N) (Gould unpubl. data).  This spatial trend is 
somewhat confounded by the temporal shift in the 
gillnet fishery toward the north as the summer 
progresses.  Thus, it is difficult to separate the 
spatial and seasonal aspects of the patterns 
observed.  Of the fish consumed, lanternfishes 
(Myctophidae) were most important in short-tailed 
shearwater diets and Pacific saury was most 
important for sooty shearwaters.  Although there 
was little east-west variation in the occurrence of 
myctophids in the stomachs of sooty shearwaters, 
Japanese sardines were taken almost exclusively in 
the westernmost portions of the North Pacific 
(Gould unpubl. data).  Buller’s shearwaters, which 
were far more abundant in the Western Transition 
Zone than in the east, had a diet composed of 71% 
by mass of Pacific saury (Gould et al., 1998a).

4 FOOD CONSUMPTION BY MARINE MAMMALS IN THE NORTH 
PACIFIC OCEAN 
 
4.1 Introduction 
At least forty-seven species of marine mammals 
are known to i nhabit the PICES region in the 
North Pacific Ocean.  Although accurate estimates 
of population abundance for these species are 
notoriously difficult to obtain, the number of 
individuals may exceed 10,000,000.  A major 
factor that makes this group of apex predators so 
important ecologically is their wide distribution, 
high abundance, and their relatively large body 
size.  Average body weights of marine mammal 
species in the North Pacific (from cetaceans and 
pinnipeds to polar bears and sea otters) ranges 
from 28 kg (northern fur seal) to 102,736 kg (blue 
whale). 
 
Marine mammals generally migrate annually 
between breeding and feeding areas.  Pinnipeds 
use both land and ocean habitats, while whales 
stay in water throughout their life.  Most pinnipeds 
are distributed among solitary islands or rocky 
beaches where humans cannot approach easily.  
Phocids that live near drift ice migrate with the ice 
(Naito, 1976), while those inhabiting beaches 
move nearer to their breeding places along coastal 
areas (Naito, 1982).  Among the otariids, Steller 
sea lions migrate mainly in the coastal area but 
some of them go far to sea to forage (Kastelein & 
Weltz, 1991; Loughlin et al., 1987, 1993).  
Northern fur seals migrate in the open sea (Bigg, 
1982, 1990; Nagasaki, 1960; Wada, 1971a; Lander 
& Kajimura, 1982).  The migration distances of 
northern fur seals are perhaps the longest of the 
pinnipeds in the North Pacific Ocean.  Almost all 
immature fur seals remain distributed in the 
central North Pacific Ocean during the first few 
years of life (Baba et al., 1993).  
 
Most of the mysticetes migrate to higher latitudes 
to feed on prey in summer.  They inhabit lower 
latitudes to breed in winter and feeding activity is 
not common there (Gaskin, 1982).  An exception 
is the Bryde’s whale, which stays in a lower 
latitudinal range throughout the year (Gaskin, 
1982).  Unlike the mysticetes, odontocetes do not 
have such clear seasonality in their feeding 
activity.  Most of the smaller odontocetes migrate 
seasonally, but the range is rather local. Migration 
patterns are known in both north-south movements 
and also between coastal and pelagic areas.  Dall’s 
porpoise in the western side of the North Pacific 
migrate to the Sea of Okhotsk in summer, and 
migrate to the Japan/East Sea and the northwestern 
North Pacific in winter (Miyashita, 1991; Amano 
& Kuramochi, 1992).  In contrast to the 
populations in the western side of the North 
Pacific, migrations of Dall’s porpoise in the 
eastern North Pacific are described only as 
onshore-offshore movements (Kajimura & 
Loughlin, 1988).  The migration patterns of sperm 
whales depend on their sex and body size.  Smaller 
males and females migrate from middle to lower 
latitudes, while larger males migrate to higher 
latitudes in summer. In winter, they are distributed 
in middle to lower latitudes (Best, 1979; Kato, 
1995). 
 
There are some reports on the trophic structure of 
marine ecosystems (Laevasto & Larkins, 1981).  
Marine mammals are usually recognized as the top 
predators in marine ecosystems (e.g. Hobson et 
al., 1997).  The prey items of marine mammals 
vary by season and place. Seals inhabiting drifting 
sea ice take prey under the sea ice (Fisher & 
Mackenzie, 1954; Frost & Lowry, 1980). Seals 
and sea lions in coastal areas feed on bottom 
fishes, mesopelagic fishes, and cephalopods (Itoo 
et al., 1983; Merrick et al., 1997; Kato, 1982).  
Northern fur seals take epipelagic fishes and 
cephalopods in the open sea (Panina, 1966; 
Sinclair et al., 1994; Wada, 1971b; Kajimura & 
Loughlin, 1988; Kajimura, 1984).  Steller sea lions 
sometimes take northern fur seal pups (Gentry & 
Johnson, 1981). Seabird remains have been 
observed in the stomachs of sea otters, northern 
fur seals, and walrus (VanWagenen et al., 1981; 
Gjertz, 1990; Yoshida et al., 1978).  
 
Mysticetes usually feed on zooplankton such as 
euphausiids and copepods.  However, some 
species such as fin, Bryde’s, minke and humpback 
whales also regularly feed on fishes as well 
 
 
 
20
(Kawamura, 1980; Kasamstu & Tanaka, 1991; 
Tamura et al., 1998).  The prey fishes are usually 
abundant shoaling fishes including sardines, 
herrings, anchovies, sauries and mackerels 
(Kawamura, 1980; Gaskin, 1982; Kasamstu & 
Tanaka 1991; Tamura et al., 1998).  Grey whales 
feed on benthic organisms living in mud on the 
continental shelf (Gaskin, 1982).  Larger 
odontocetes including sperm and Baird’s beaked 
whales prefer cephalopods, but sometimes fishes 
are important prey in specific areas (Nishiwaki & 
Oguro, 1971; Clarke, 1980; Kawakami, 1980).  
Smaller odontocetes including dolphins and 
porpoises feed on small fishes and squids, but 
false killer and pygmy killer whales sometimes 
attack other whales and dolphins (Perryman & 
Foster, 1980; Walker & Jones, 1994; Palacios & 
Mate, 1996; Walker, 1996; Ohizumi et al., 1998).  
Killer whales feed on large prey including fishes, 
squids, sea birds, sea turtles and marine mammals 
(Caldwell & Caldwell, 1969; Gaskin, 1982; Estes 
et al., 1998). 
 
The kinds of food consumed change with seasonal 
migrations of marine mammals (Perez & Bigg, 
1986).  Though some marine mammals have 
strong preferences for certain types of prey 
(Lindstrom et al., 1998; Cox et al., 1996), almost 
all marine mammals are opportunistic feeders 
(Kajimura, 1984).  Marine mammals usually feed 
nocturnally and foraging behavior is often related 
to the daily movement of fish or squid (Kajimura, 
1984).  Some marine mammals (e.g., Steller sea 
lions and humpback whales) take food by 
schooling the prey into a ball (Riedman, 1990).  
Marine mammals dive deeply; for instance, 
northern elephant seals dive up to about 1,250m 
(Le Boeuf et al., 1985, 1986), and sperm whales 
can dive to about 3,000m.  This means that prey 
items of marine mammals comprise a wide variety 
from bottom dwellers to surface fauna.   
 
There have been several studies of food 
consumption by marine mammals (e.g. Perez & 
McAlister, 1993; Hammill & Stenson, 1997).  For 
example, Antonelis et al. (1984) examined the 
annual food consumption by northern fur seals off 
California.  Steller sea lions, harbor seals, and 
northern fur seals in the Gulf of Alaska have been 
estimated to be taking as much as 617,000 mt of 
prey (ASG report 93-01, 1993).  Interactions 
between marine mammals and fisheries have also 
been evaluated (Lowry & Forst, 1985; Swartzman 
& Harr, 1985; Trites et al., 1997). 
 
Tamura & Ohsumi (1999) estimated the annual 
food consumption by whales in the world is from 
100,000,000 mt to 500,000,000 mt.  However, 
there have been no specific attempts to estimate 
the total amount of prey consumed by all marine 
mammals in the North Pacific Ocean.  
 
4.2 Methods 
In evaluating food consumption by marine 
mammals throughout the PICES region, our 
working group was immediately faced with the 
reality that there are immense data gaps in our 
understanding of marine mammal population size, 
seasonal distribution, migration patterns, prey 
preferences in different geographic areas, and both 
the energetic requirements of the mammals as well 
as the energetic content of their various prey.  
Therefore, we quickly realized that the daunting 
task that we had been assigned had the danger of 
leading us to make unrealistic assumptions to fill 
those gaps.  After considerable debate, we agreed 
that the bulk of our work would focus on 
developing three sets of tables designed to present 
a sample of what was known about this topic, and, 
perhaps more importantly, to highlight the large 
holes in knowledge that prevent a realistic 
assessment of the total amounts of prey consumed 
by marine mammals in the North Pacific.  
Appendix Tables 9, 10, and 11 present the results 
of our syntheses.  The reader will note that many 
of the cells in the tables are blank.  We 
deliberately chose blanks rather than 
overextending the limits of credibility in making 
weakly supported assumptions just for the sake of 
drafting tables that looked more complete.  
However, it will be appreciated that in developing 
tables with so many blanks, the extent to which we 
could draw conclusions was limited.  Therefore, in 
those cases where we have attempted a more 
detailed interpretation of the results derived from 
these tables, we chose to focus on the western 
PICES sub-regions as examples of what might be 
learned from this type of synthesis.

4.2.1 Defining marine mammal stocks and 
populations 
In ecology, a population is typically defined as a 
group of interbreeding or potentially inter-
breeding individuals of the same species.  The 
word “stock” is often used in fisheries science to 
mean a congregation of populations for population 
analysis and management of the species.  
Populations and stocks of marine mammals are not 
fully understood, especially regarding large 
whales.  Marine mammals migrate so widely that 
it is very difficult to estimate the population 
abundance or stock discreteness in each PICES 
sub-regions.  Therefore, due to the nature of 
animal behavior and also the lack of information, 
we incorporated solely summer information (June 
– September, 122 days) in our analysis. 
 
4.2.2 Marine mammal abundance 
We attempted to incorporate marine mammal 
population abundance in each PICES sub-region 
as much as possible although we had considerable 
difficulties subdividing the data and abundance 
estimates to fit the PICES sub-regions.  The 
populations are derived from sighting surveys, 
colony counts, tag recovery, CPUE (catch per unit 
effort), and distribution density based on the best 
information currently available.  Population 
estimates of marine mammals are shown in 
Appendix 9, which is subdivided into thirteen 
separate sub-regions within the PICES region.  In 
these tables, L is line transect, S is strip transect, 
M is mark recapture, C is colony count, E is catch 
per unit of effort, and D is density index of 
distribution. In the western sub-regions, popula-
tions of seals and sea lions were quoted from 
papers of NPFSC (1984) and Buckland et al. 
(1993) for northern fur seal, of Loughlin et al. 
(1992) for Steller sea lion, of Popov (1982) for 
phocids in the Okhotsk Sea, and of Hayama 
(1988) for Kurile seals.  
 
For cetaceans in the western PICES sub-regions, 
we incorporated population estimates by sighting 
surveys mainly based on line-transect sampling 
theory (Gates et al., 1968), which is usually 
adopted by the Scientific Committee of 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) for 
abundance estimation purpose. Populations of 
whales and dolphins were quoted from papers of 
Kato et al. (1997) for sperm w hales, Dall’s 
porpoises, Pacific white-sided dolphins, and minke 
whales, Miyashita & Kato (1993) for Baird’s 
beaked whales, Shimada & Miyashita (1997) for 
Bryde’s whales, Miyashita (1993a) for Dall’s 
porpoises, short-finned pilot whales, bottlenose 
dolphins, Risso’s dolphins, spotted dolphins, and 
striped dolphins, Kato & Miyazaki (1986) for 
Dall’s porpoise, Miyashita (1992) for northern 
right-whale dolphins, and Pacific white-sided 
dolphins, Brownell et al. (1999) for bowhead and 
gray whales. 
 
However, the information is not sufficient for 
many sub-divisions, and in such cases we have 
kept cells blank for areas in which abundance 
estimates were unavailable or deemed unreliable. 
Furthermore, if a marine mammal is known to 
migrate among two or more PICES sub-regions, 
the same number of populations is assumed to 
extend into those sub-regions as a tentative 
measure.  However, this approach did not allow us 
to accurately estimate the population sizes for 
certain species during the summer months. 
 
4.2.3 Distribution and seasonal movements of 
marine mammals 
The breeding season for marine mammals differs 
by species.  For example, it is generally from June 
to September for otariid seals, and from April to 
June for phocid seals.  The lactation period also 
differs by species.  It varies in length from weeks 
for phocid seals (Riedman, 1990), to from 4 
months to more than one year for otariid seals 
(Peterson, 1968; Gentry, 1981; Schusterman, 
1981).  Therefore, the prey species of both pup 
and mother seals is likely to be similar during 
lactation periods.  The prey of juvenile seals is 
somewhat different because they are distributed 
far out to sea, away from the breeding sites on 
islands and along the mainland coasts (Hobbs & 
Jones, 1993).  
 
Most pinnipeds in the PICES region move south 
after the breeding season.  Many non-breeding 
individuals are never present near the breeding 
grounds.  For some species, southward migration 
begins during October to January, and northward 
migrations begin during April through June.  
Migration speed is generally about 4 km•h
-1
 for 
 
 
 
22
northern fur seals (Kiyota et al., 1992) and about 
18.8•km
-1
 for humpback whales (Mate et al., 
1998).  Their migration routes are not fully 
understood, but satellite tracking is helping to 
clarify these patterns.  For instance, northern fur 
seals migrate to the central North Pacific from 
their breeding islands and then approach coastal 
areas (Kiyota et al., 1992).  Northern elephant 
seals migrate to the vicinity of the Aleutian Islands 
from breeding islands off California (Stewart & 
DeLong, 1995). 
 
Most species of cetaceans are highly migratory, 
especially Mysticetes, which are widely 
distributed at higher latitudes in summer for 
feeding and in lower latitudes in winter for 
breeding; some penetrate into areas well north or 
south of the PICES region.  However, their 
migration corridors are not well known except for 
gray and bowhead whales which breed and feed in 
coastal regions.  Although sperm whales have a 
seasonal migration similar to that of mysticetes, 
most odontocetes remain in particular water 
masses throughout the year with some north-south 
seasonal or inshore-offshore migration.  Some 
types of local resident populations are thought to 
exist. 
 
In conclusion, cetaceans are distributed widely 
throughout the PICES region, however both 
mysticete and ondontocete whales seasonally shift 
their habitats at least over the PICES sub-regions 
and it is rare for the same population to remain 
within the same PICES sub-region throughout 
year. 
 
4.2.4 Marine mammal diets used in the model 
Marine mammal diets vary widely.  Furthermore, 
sex, age, reproductive condition, time and foraging 
locations of individual marine mammals alter their 
prey preferences.  Although it is difficult to 
summarize, we attempted to select at least some 
general estimates of food consumption.  Therefore, 
we used values reported by Pauly et al. (1998) and 
these are shown as the “default” prey preferences 
in Appendix Table 10.  These values were derived 
as generalized approximations of food habits for 
particular species of marine mammals on a 
worldwide basis. 
 
4.2.5 Marine mammal energy requirements 
In general, the energy requirements of marine 
mammals in summer seem to be high due to 
breeding activities.  It is difficult to measure the 
amount of energy required by wild marine 
mammals directly so we used a generalized 
formula relating the amount of food consumption 
(energy requirement) and to body weight (Perez et 
al., 1990).  The formula is: 
 
log E = a + 0.75 · log M 
 
where E = energy requirement per day (kcal•d
-1
), a 
= coefficient, and M = mean body weight (kg).  
The value for “a” is 317 for toothed whales, 192 
for baleen whales, 372 for otariid seals, and 200 
for phocid seals.  It was converted into kj as 1 kcal 
= 4.186 kj. 
 
The average body weight of each species was 
quoted from Trites & Pauly (1998).  If average 
body weights of males and females were reported 
separately, we calculated the mean of them and 
used it as the representative value of the species.  
The marine mammals’ daily energy requirements 
are shown in Appendix Table 9 by species. 
 
4.2.6 Energy content of marine mammal prey 
The energy value of prey varied among prey 
species and location.  Energy values of some fish 
in winter are higher than in summer (Jangagard, 
1974; Bigg et al., 1978).  Although a wide variety 
of reports concerning the energy value of marine 
mammal prey have been published, we used the 
following general values:  benthic invertebrates 4 
kj•g
-1
; crustacean zooplankton, 4 kj•g
-1
; small 
cephalopods 3.5 kj•g
-1
; large cephalopods 4 kj•g
-1
, 
epipelagic fishes (in the surface layers, for 
example, pollock, mackerel), 7 kj•g
-1
 mesopelagic 
fishes (in the middle layers, for example, 
myctophids, herring), 7 kj•g
-1
 miscellaneous 5 
kj•g
-1
, seabird and marine mammals 7 kj•g
-1
. 
 
4.2.7 Food utilization efficiency of marine 
mammals  
There is, of course, some loss of energy when prey 
are consumed and digested by marine mammals.  
This loss of energetic transfer follows from lost 
food during eating (i.e., food scraps lost), 
 
 
 
23
inefficient absorption (i.e., energy excreted as 
feces), and a general loss due to the metabolic cost 
of digestion.  Prey items also vary in the 
nutritional condition.  For example, fish with high 
fat quality is absorbed better than the fish with low 
fat quality.  Although marine mammal prey items 
are represented by several different taxonomic 
groups:  plankton, squid, octopus, fishes, seabirds 
to marine mammals, we have assumed an 
assimilation efficiency of 75% for the conversion 
of daily energy requirements to the amount of prey 
needed to meet those requirements.  
 
4.3 Model Output 
The total number of marine mammal species 
recognized in the western part of the PICES region 
was 41 (Table 9).  The maximum number of 
species of marine mammals was 33 in the KR/OY 
sub-regions and the minimum number was 14 in 
the ECS sub-region.  The fact that the number of 
species is high in the KR/OY sub-regions is 
related to the Kuroshio and Oyashio currents.  The 
average percentage of the number of species 
whose population is known is about 27% (range; 
7% in the WSA sub-regions - 58% in the OKH 
sub-regions) (Table 10). 
 
The range of marine mammal population sizes in 
the western PICES region varied from about 
4,620,000 animals in the WTZ sub-region to about 
2,300 animals in the WSA sub-region (Table 11).  
The total population of marine mammals in the 
western PICES region is about 10,410,000 animals 
(including duplicated population within 
neighboring sub-regions).  The total population of 
marine mammals (excluding the duplicated 
populations) was about 6,500,000 animals.  This 
value was derived under the condition of 27% of 
the marine mammal species inhabiting in the 
western part of the PICES region (Table 9). 
 
The total biomass of marine mammals in the 
western parts of the PICES region during summer 
was approximately 209,700,000 mt as a minimum 
estimate.  The biomass of marine mammals in 
each PICES sub-region ranged from 
approximately 2,000,000 mt in the SJP sub-region 
to approximately 121,400,000 mt in the WTZ sub-
region (Table 11).  On the other hand, the total 
energy requirement of marine mammals in the 
western PICES sub-regions during summer was 
about 5,372·10
10
 kj.  The energy requirement of 
marine mammals in each of these sub-regions 
ranged from about 25·10
10
 kj in the SJP sub-
region to about 2,904·10
10
 kj in the WTZ sub-
region (Table 11).  The estimated values of daily 
energy requirements of marine mammals in all 
sub-regions in summer (June-September) is also 
summarized in Appendix 9. 
 
The estimated prey composition of each marine 
mammal in the western sub-region is shown in 
Appendix 10.  The prey composition was 36-46% 
fish and 13-36% squid (Table 12).  Apart from fish 
and squid, the prey composition was high for 
benthic invertebrates (20.4%) in the OKH sub-
regions and for crustacean zooplankton (36.9%) in 
the WSA sub-regions (Table 12).  The presumed 
percentage of marine mammal prey items during 
summer in all sub-regions is shown in Appendix 
10. 
 
The total amount of food consumed by marine 
mammals in the western North Pacific Ocean 
during summer was about 13,020,000 mt (Table 
13a,b).  Again, it should be noted that the 
estimated value is a conservative one because the 
estimate is based on minimum predator abundance 
due to a lack of high-quality quantitative 
information for both the abundance and food 
consumption of many predators and in many sub-
regions.  Among these sub-regions, the highest 
value of consumption was about 6,395,000 mt 
(49% of total) in the WTZ sub-region, and the 
lowest was 70,000 tons (0.5%) in the SJP sub-
region.  The amount of food consumed, by PICES 
sub-region, is shown in Appendix 11. 
 
4.4 Discussion 
4.4.1 Reliability of estimates of prey 
consumption by marine mammals 
Many potential errors, i.e. the change of energy 
requirement, prey species, feeding behavior, 
energy value of prey, population abundance etc., 
influence our estimate o f the amount of food 
consumed by marine mammals.  Errors in the 
estimates are introduced by changes of observers, 
instruments, sea condition, and sighting counts, 
etc.  Of these, the population and food habits are 
considered to be important factors affecting the 
 
 
 
24
accuracy of the estimates of food consumption.  
Especially lacking are population abundance 
estimates for many species and in many strata 
(PICES sub-regions), which obviously leads to a 
serious downward bias in our estimates of total 
food consumption by marine mammals.  Thus, our 
present estimate of food consumption is 
necessarily a great under-representation and 
should be understood as a minimum value of the 
total food consumption. 
 
For our calculations, we used the energy method 
of consumption estimation of Perez and McAlister 
(1993).  Their formula uses daily energy 
expenditures (DEE) derived from average body 
weight of animals and the food weight consumed 
through the year in captivity. Metabolic energy is 
in proportion to 3/4 square of body weight.  
Generally BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is known 
as the formula of M = 70·W
0.75
 (Kleiber, 1961), 
where M is BMR (Kcal/day) and W is body 
weight (kg).  The BMR is an absolute 
measurement taken when the animal is not using 
muscle, digestion, and adjustment o f body 
temperature at all.  DEE of mammals was 2.1- 2.7 
times of BMR (Farlow, 1976; Feldkamp, 1985).  
Innes et al. (1987) reported that active metabolic 
rates of marine mammals ranged from about twice 
the value of Kleiber BMR for phocid seals to over 
four times the value for otariid seals. Costa et al. 
(1985), Nagy (1987), and Gentry and Kooyman 
(1986) suggested that active pinnipeds may have 
active metabolic rates about three times that of 
their resting metabolic rates.  The formula in used 
this report was not so different from their values.  
The error introduced by these differences is 
smaller than the large errors associated with other 
parameters (e.g., abundance estimates).  Energy 
values of prey species varied by season and 
location.  It must be examined more precisely, and 
all values of prey species’ energy used in the 
model should be verified in future. 
 
The prey species preferences were derived from 
various data sources, i.e., stomach contents, scat, 
etc.  The food consumption is influenced greatly 
by the physiology of animals. Results of feeding 
habits are affected by sampling time (Markussen, 
1993), digestion (Helm, 1984), prey preference 
(Sinclair et al., 1994), feeding behavior, and body 
condition of animal.  These parameters affect the 
resulting f ood consumption estimates.  More 
information concerning food habits and population 
abundance of marine mammals are needed to 
understand the role of marine mammals in marine 
ecosystems.  
 
4.4.2 Regional variation in numbers of marine 
mammals 
The density of marine mammals in the western 
PICES sub-regions (BSP, OKH, KM/KL, WSA, 
WTZ, KR/OY, and SJP) ranged from 0.002 
individuals per km
2
 in the SJP sub-region to 0.6 
individuals per km
2
 in the OKH sub-region.  The 
overall density in the western sub-regions was 
0.36 individuals per km
2
.  The density in the WTZ 
sub-region alone (41% species coverage) was also 
0.36 individuals per km
2
 (Table 14). 
 
Although the amount of information varies by 
species and sub-region, it is possible to summarize 
the general tendency as follows.  The average 
body weight of all marine mammals in the WTZ 
(215 kg per individual=121,417,000mt / 4,619,545 
individuals / 122 days) was smaller than that of 
KR/OY (671 kg per individual) during summer 
(June-September).  The reason for this is that there 
are many dolphins in the WTZ and many whales 
in the KR/OY.  In addition, the KR/OY has the 
upwelling of Kuroshio and Oyashio Currents, 
though the continental shelves in KR/OY sub-
region are narrow.  Although the WTZ sub-region 
does not have a continental s helf, there are 
transition zones consisting of fronts formed by the 
confluence of the Kuroshio and Oyashio Currents.  
Many plankton, Diaphus sp., saury, pomfret, and 
flying squid, etc. exist in WTZ.  
 
Both OKH and BSP are covered with drifting ice 
in winter and the productivity of the ocean 
therefore increases in summer.  But the average 
body weight for all marine mammals was small 
(194 kg per individual in OKH and 96 kg per 
individual in BSP) compared to WTZ (215 kg per 
individual) and KR/OY (671 kg per individual).  
This was due to an abundance of seals. 
Furthermore, the biomass of marine mammals in 
BSP was smaller than that of OKH.  This may be 
due to a smaller continental shelf in BSP 
compared to the OKH.  The mean weight of 
marine mammals in KM/KL was 8 4 kg per 
 
 
 
25
individual.  This is due to the narrow continental 
shelf and poor nutrient condition of the sea.  The 
Sea of Japan becomes warm in summer owing to 
the Tsushima warm current.  Dall’s porpoises, 
pacific white-sided dolphins, minke whales etc. 
are distributed here mainly during summer, but the 
population estimates were available for only two 
whales (minke and Baird’s beaked whales). 
 
4.4.3 Regional variation in consumption by 
marine mammals 
The total food consumption of marine mammals in 
the western PICES s ub-regions during summer 
(June-September, 122 days) was estimated to be 
about 13,000,000 mt in this study.  This is about 
6% (range 3 -10%) of the daily energy 
consumption per body mass of marine mammals.  
This value is within the feeding rate (4-15%) of 
marine mammals as reported before (Spottee & 
Adams, 1981) (Table 11). 
 
Fish represented about 60% of total prey in both 
WTZ and KM/KL. Squid represented 56% of total 
in KR/OY and about 70% in WSA (Table 13b).  
On the other hand, a sum of benthic invertebrate’s 
(23%) and crustacean zooplankton (27%) accounts 
for 50% of total food consumption in OKH.  The 
percentage of benthic invertebrates was about 45% 
in BSP.  The percentage of crustacean zooplankton 
represents about 34% in SJP.  Thus, the main food 
of marine mammals varies among the PICES sub-
regions.  This result may reflect the important prey 
for dominant marine mammals in the North 
Pacific Ocean. 
 
Food consumption of marine mammals in the 
North Pacific Ocean is comprised of 52% for fish 
and 36% for squid during summer.  It should be 
noted that some of the food consumption data of 
marine mammals used in this report were derived 
from studies of the feeding habits of marine 
mammals in the Southern Hemisphere.  Feeding 
habits are known to be different between Northern 
Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.  Updated 
information on the actual feeding habits of specific 
marine mammals should be incorporated into 
future analysis. 
 
4.4.4 Data gaps 
Although we tried to incorporate as much 
information as was possible, we only incorporated 
data from about 11 (27%) of the 41 species of 
marine mammals that are known to inhabit the 
western PICES sub-regions.  If the marine 
mammals in the eastern sector are considered, this 
percentage would grow even smaller.  Moreover, 
even when information was available, its quality 
was not necessarily sufficient to satisfy the 
standards needed to accurately assess feeding 
intensity of top predators in marine ecosystems.  
Obviously, a great deal of additional information 
is needed before the types of assessments and 
synthesis initiated in this exercise can be 
undertaken with success.  Data gaps that require 
attention include population abundance estimates, 
seasonal movements, feeding rates, region-specific 
food preferences, and the energetic content of prey 
items. 
 
4.4.5 General remarks 
In this report, we estimated the total food 
consumption by marine mammals as 13,020,000 
mt.  However, this estimate is obviously a 
minimum estimate of the consumption due to 
reasons such as using minimum estimate of 
predator abundance, as explained in the previous 
section.  Thus, the value should be re-examined in 
the future with incorporation of further 
information that will be obtained through new 
research.

1/  Harrison (1984) found high frequencies of occurrence of scyphomedusae in the diets of these species.   
2/  Hunt et al. (1996a) found that Thysanoessa rashii was the almost exclusive prey of short-tailed shearwaters around the Pribilof Islands.  
3/  Springer et al. (1987) found Eleginus gracilis and Ammodytes hexapterus overall to be the most important prey of Common Murres and Black-legged Kittiwakes at Bluff,  
     They found that Boreogadus saida were the most important diet component of Common and Thick-billed murres at St. Lawrence Island, and that  
     Ammodytes hexapterus dominated the diets of Black-legged Kittiwakes at St. Lawrence Island.      
4/  Springer et al. (1986) found Theragra chalcogramma to be the most important food of thick-billed murres, common murres, and black-legged kittiwakes on St. Matthew Island.  
     They also found a variety of invertebrates in the diets of the three species including crabs, pteropods, polychaetes, and miscellaneous crustaceans. 
     The exception to this was in 1982 when Pleuronectidae were tentatively identified as being of major importance in the diet of black-legged kittiwakes. 
5/  Decker et al. (1995) used same data to show same diets.          
6/  Ogi et al. (1985) found the major prey of Common Murres in the northwest Bering Sea to be Parathemisto libellula but, unlike Thick-billed Murres Common murres ate substantial  
     amounts of euphausiids and fish (see Ogi and Hamanaka 1982).         
7/ Decker and Hunt (1996) found Theragra chalcogramma and Thysanoessa raschii to be the primary prey of thick-billed and common murres around the Pribilof Islands.   
    They also found squid to be important in common murre diets, but their sample sizes were small.      
8/  Ogi and Hamanaka (1982) found Amphipods (especially Parathemisto libellula) to be the most important prey of thick-billed murres in the Gulf of Anadyr and adjacent  
     waters of the northwestern Bering Sea.  They found jellyfish only in thick-billed murres from the Gulf of Anadyr (0.2%) . The only species of fish found in the diet was Mallotus villosus. 
9/  Bédard (1969) found that Calanus finmarchicus, probably a misidentification of Neocalanus plumchrus, to dominate diets of least auklets at St. Lawrence Island. He found that Thysanoessa spp. and Gammaridea dominated the diet of crested auklets and that Calanus cristatus, Parathemisto 
libellula and Limacina were of major importance in the diet of parakeet auklets 
10/  Harrison (1990) found that: euphausiids dominated the diet of crested auklets on St. Matthew and St. Lawrence Islands and were important in the Chirikov Basin; Ctenophores and 
     scyphomedusae dominated the diet of parakeet auklets in the Chirikov Basin; and Decapods in the diets of least and crested auklets.  
11/  Piatt et al. (1990) found Thysanoessa spp. to comprise 97.8% of mass in diet of Crested Auklets, and that Neocalanus plumchrus composed 87% of diet of Least Auklets.   
     They also found trace amounts of fish and squid in Least Auklet diets. 
12/ Roby & Brink (1986) reviewed the literature and determined that the major prey of least auklets was consistently calanoid copepods. 
  
13/  Springer & Roseneau (1985) found Calanus marshallae to comprise 84-89% of diet on St. Matthew Island, 3-65% on St. Lawrence Island, and 30% on Pribilof Islands.   
      They found that C. plumchrus and C. cristatus were important on St. Lawrence Island and on the Pribilof Islands. 
14/  Hunt and Harrison (1990) identified Neocalanus plumchtrus as the major prey of least auklets on King Island 
15/  Hunt et al. (1990) identified N. plumchurs and N. cristatus  as the major prey species of least auklets near St. Lawrence Island. They also found a few crab larvae and zoea, and Limacina in a few stomachs.

1/ Trapp (1979) found that sea urchins dominated diets of glaucous-winged gulls at Agattu and Alaid-Nitzki Islands, and that birds dominated the diet at Buldir and Semisopochnoi Islands,  
     and that fish dominated the diets at Little Kiska Island.              
2/ Day and Byrd (1989) found that Neocalanus cristatus made up 100% of Parakeet Auklet diets, Neocalanus cristatus made up 100% of Crested Auklet diets, and Neocalanus plumchrus  
     made up 99.9 % of Least Auklet diets at Buldir Island.

1/ Wehle (1983) found that Ammodytes hexapterus was the most numerous prey with greatest frequency of occurrence at the Shumagin Islands in 1976 and at the Barren Islands in 1977,  
     and that A. hexapterus and Mallotus villosus were of nearly equal numbers and frequency at the Barren Islands in 1977.   
2/ Wehle (1983) found that Ammodytes hexapterus was the most numerous prey with greatest frequency of occurrence at Ugaiushak and Middleton Islands while Mallotus villosus  
     was the most numerous prey number with greatest frequency of occurrence at Cathedral and the Barren Islands.    
3/ Sanger & Hatch (1987) found that Theragra chalcogramma was the most important prey fed to young at Tangagm, Aiktak, and Midun Islands, that Mallotus villosus was the most  
     important prey on Egg Island, and that Ammodytes hexapterus was the most important prey on Suklik, Fox, Middleton, and Cathedral Islands, that A. hexapterus and M. villosus were  
     equally important on Noisy and Cliff Islands, and that Oncorhynchus keta was the most important prey on Naked Island.

1/  Sealy (1975) found that Thysanoessa spinifera (42.7% numbers) and Euphausia pacifica (49.7% numbers) made up the greatest portion of the breeding adult Ancient Murrelet diet,  
     that Thysanoessa spinifera (48.7%) and Ammodytes hexapterus (41.2% numbers) made up the greatest portion of subadult murrelet diets, and that Ammodytes hexapterus  
     (98.3% numbers) made up most of the newly fledged murrelet diet.        
2/  Burger & Powell (1990) found that Ammodytes hexapterus made up 58% on average of the Cassin's Auklet diet, and  that euphausiids made up 28%.  Vermeer et al. (1985) found  
     Cassin's Auklets to have a diet similar to this one.          
3/  Vermeer et al. (1985) found that Neocalanus cristatus made up 46% and euphausiids made up 31.2% of prey by wet weight. 
4/  Vermeer (1984) found that scyphomedusae were present (2-5% wet weight) in the diet of Cassin's Auklet.    
5/  Vermeer (1981) found that Calanus cristatus made up 38.6% of diet of Cassin's auklets.      
6/  Vermeer & Westrheim (1984) found that Ammodytes hexapterus made up 27-59% of the biomass of the Rhinoceros Auklet diet, and that Cololabis saira and Herring (Clupea harengus) were 
      very important in some areas.          
7/  Vermeer (1980) found that Pacific Saury (Cololabis saira) dominated diets in 1976, Sandlance (Ammodytes hexapterus) and Sauries dominated in 1977, and rockfish and bluethroat argentines  
      dominated in 1988 at Triangle Island.

2/ Hunt et al. (1979) found that Scorpaenidae spp. made up 25% by weight of Brandt's Cormorant diet, and Sebastes spp. made up 86.9% of diet by volume of Double-crested cormorants. 
3/ Wiens & Scott 1975 found that Crustaceans made up 27 % of the Common Murre diet. 
4/  Briggs et al. 1988 found that Thysanoessa spinifera, Euphausia pacifica and Sebastes spp. were abundant in the diets of Cassin's auklet and common murre. 
5/  Sydeman et al. 1997 found that miscellaneous invertebrates made up 0.1% of the Pigeon Guillemot diet and that Sebastes jordani was the principal prey species. 
6/  Sydeman et al. 1997 found that Euphausia pacifica was the most important prey item in the Cassin's Auklet diet. 
7/  Manuwal 1974 found major prey to be Thysanoessa spinifera, Amphipods (Phromema), and immature squid in the diet of Cassin's Auklet. 
8/  Hunt et al. (1979) found that fish, especially Sebastes spp. were important in diet for Cassin's Auklet.

Appendix 10. Marine mammal prey preference 
 
Appendix Table 10.1. Marine mammal prey preferences in PICES marine ecosystems (Sub-region: BSC).  Approximate percent composition 
(by weight or volume) is given for general prey categories.  The parenthetical values are general trophic level estimates by Pauly et al. (1998) for 
diet composition based on diet studies from marine areas around the world and throughout the year; therefore, these general values may not be 
directly relevant to the actual diet composition in this PICES subarea during summer.  Note that the category benthic invertebrates includes all 
invertebrates inhabiting bottom habitats (e.g., bivalves, octopi, crabs, shrimp, amphipods, etc.).

(by weight or volume) is given for general prey categories.  The parenthetical values are general trophic level estimates by Pauly et al. (1998) for 
diet composition based on diet studies from marine areas around the world and throughout the year; therefore, these general values may not be 
directly relevant to the actual diet composition in this PICES subarea during summer.  Note that the category benthic invertebrates includes all 
invertebrates inhabiting bottom habitats (e.g., bivalves, octopi, crabs, shrimp, amphipods, etc.).

Appendix Table 10.12. Marine mammal prey preferences in PICES marine ecosystems (Sub-region: KR/OY).  Approximate percent 
composition (by weight or volume) is given for general prey categories.  The parenthetical values are general trophic level estimates by Pauly et al. 
(1998) for diet composition based on diet studies from marine areas around the world and throughout the year; therefore, these general values may 
not be directly relevant to the actual diet composition in this PICES subarea during summer.  Note that the category benthic invertebrates includes 
all invertebrates inhabiting bottom habitats (e.g., bivalves, octopi, crabs, shrimp, amphipods, etc.).

Appendix 12. Bibliography of prey use by seabirds of the North Pacific Ocean 
 
The literature on marine birds of the North Pacific is voluminous and diverse.  Unfortunately, most 
published studies are local and seasonal, and there are few major syntheses for large areas or time frames.  
In this compendium, we have attempted to assemble references to the majority of papers important for 
assessing the food habits of marine birds in the North Pacific Ocean.  We have also included here 
numerous papers that deal with other regions, but were vital to the development of this report.
