Oregon State University (OSU, Corvallis, Oregon, U.S.A.) was the site, from May 23–24,  2005, of an 
international workshop on Oceanic Ecodynamyics COmparison in the Subarctic Pacific (OECOS) 
organized by Drs. Charles B. Miller and Tsutomu Ikeda, and sponsored by PICES (with assistance from 
the OSU Research Office and the OSU College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences).  Japanese and 
North American scientists discussed the fundamental questions and observational details of proposed 
comparative studies of ecological processes in the upper waters of the oceanic subarctic Pacific. 
 
   
I. Scientific Issues Posed by OECOS 
 
The physical setting of the subarctic Pacific was 
well described by Favorite et al. (1976).  North of 
the latitude where the 33 pss salinity isocline turns 
vertically and surfaces, about 43°N, the water 
column is characterized by a 1 pss halocline at 
about 100 m depth, a density gradient which 
supports substantial internal waves.  It is also a 
barrier to vertical mixing throughout the year that 
prevents (1) full replenishment of surface nutrients 
to deep concentrations and (2) complete removal 
of euphotic zone biota during winter mixing.  
From spring through autumn, there is also a 
seasonal thermocline, usually at about 35 m, 
which divides the euphotic zone into two distinct 
habitats.  The region is a current gyre with slow, 
disperse flow along the southern side, slow flow 
east of the dateline, and stronger flow with rapid 
central cores (the Alaska ‘stream’) along the 
northern side.  Flow is northward along the British 
Columbia–Alaska coast (the Alaska Current) and 
southward past Kamchatka, the Okhotsk Sea 
entrance and northern Japan (the Oyashio).  There 
is also evidence, although not particularly clear 
evidence, that this gyre divides into two south of 
the central Aleutians, resulting in partially closed 
western and eastern subarctic gyres.   
 
Oceanic sectors of the seas are defined as being far 
from the influence of land.  The cores of both 
western and eastern gyres (whether or not they are 
indeed separate) definitely qualify as oceanic.  In 
the Gulf of Alaska, at sufficient distance from 
shore, the oceanic character includes HNLC 
conditions, that is, high nitrate (HN) and low 
chlorophyll (LC), throughout the year.  Despite the 
presence of high concentrations of major nutrients 
(e.g., nitrate always greater than 6 μM), 
phytoplankton never bloom.  The bulk of 
phytoplankton are always nanoplankton, with cells 
smaller than about 5 μm, and chlorophyll levels 
rarely exceeding 0.5 μg l
–1
.   
It has been established that the HNLC character of 
subarctic Pacific waters far from land is 
attributable to limited availability of iron in the 
euphotic zone (suggested by Martin and Fitzwater, 
(1988)).  Several mesoscale iron-addition 
experiments, the Japanese SEEDS project (Tsuda 
et al., 2005b) and the Canadian–Japanese SERIES 
experiment (Boyd and Harrison, 2006), have 
shown that adding soluble iron to the upper mixed 
layer induces strong increases in standing stocks 
of microplanktonic (>5 μm) diatoms, algae that 
without iron addition, are present in very low 
abundance.  A partial explanation for the low 
chlorophyll condition (Miller et al., 1991) is that 
microheterotroph (protozoan) grazers are capable 
of rapid increase, supported by eating the 
consistently small phytoplankton.  With iron 
limitation firmly established, it remains to be 
explained fully the processes and variations of the 
lower trophic levels under normal circumstances 
without iron addition.   
 
Despite the continuously low chlorophyll 
concentrations in oceanic sectors, there is 
substantial seasonality of phytoplankton 
production rates.  In the course of the spring 
transition, during thermal stratification, rates more 
than double (Welschmeyer et al., 1993; Harrison, 
2002).  This surely is attributable to the reduced 
extent of vertical mixing and consequent increase 
in cellular light exposure.  Nitrate levels are 
reduced in this period.  This is the time that the 
production vs. grazing balance of the HNLC 
regime must be the most challenged by the 
increasing growth potential of the phytoplankton.  
In the east, there are oscillations in chlorophyll 
levels between about 0.15 and 0.6 μg l
–1
, which 
imply shifting in trophic relations among 
phytoplankton, protozoa, and possibly higher 
levels, including copepods.  It is in this period that 
a suite of copepod species (three species of 
 
   
2 
Neocalanus, and Eucalanus bungii), which mostly 
reside at depth in diapause stages for the rest of the 
year, run through active recruitment to older 
stages, grow, and prepare for a return to diapause 
after accumulation of large lipid stores.  At least in 
the eastern gyre these copepods do not eat much 
phytoplankton directly, as shown by the absence 
of chlorophyll in their guts (Dagg, 1993a,b), but 
they grow (Miller, 1993a,b) and thus must be 
supported by eating food without green pigments, 
presumably protozoa.  Thus, a food chain of at 
least three or four steps is implied just to get to 
copepod level.   
 
For the eastern sector, the dynamics of 
phytoplankton oscillations have been a subject of 
speculation (Strom et al., 2000), but there has 
been, as yet, little direct research.  One aim of 
OECOS is to understand the control of these 
oscillations.  A section is devoted to this, below. 
 
In the western sector, atmospheric dust transport 
extends farther to sea, allowing spring blooms 
dominated by diatoms to extend well out into the 
western gyre, although it appears that the core of 
the gyre, centered at approximately 51°N, 160°E, 
is persistently HNLC.  After the bloom passes, 
apparently due to the onset of iron limitation, 
HNLC conditions are established for the 
remainder of the year since major nutrients are not 
exhausted (with the extremely rare exception of 
silicate; Wong and Matear, 1999).  The spring 
bloom creates an opportunity to compare aspects 
of subarctic ecology with (east) and without (west) 
iron limitation, at least during the spring transition.  
The spring bloom in the Oyashio region should be 
fully characterized from before its onset to its 
termination.  Nutrient drawdown, floristics, fate of 
primary organic matter, and the feeding and 
growth responses of the copepod complex should 
be characterized in detail.  The dominant spring 
copepods are the same species with the same 
prolonged diapause phases as those that inhabit the 
eastern subarctic subgyre, so the comparison of 
growth under field conditions should be very 
informative.   It is expected that the availability of 
large phytoplankton will shorten the food chain, 
provide much more food, and allow much more 
rapid growth of copepods. 
 
OECOS participants propose that much can be 
learned from parallel studies and comparisons of 
processes in eastern and western subarctic sectors 
by taking advantage of both differences (bloom vs. 
continuous HNLC conditions) and similarities 
(identical copepod communities) between them.

II. Participant Contributions to the OECOS Workshop
 
Those who participated in the May 2005 OECOS 
Workshop were selected as scientists whose 
interests and access to techniques allow them to 
address specific issues in respect to subarctic 
Pacific ecodynamics.  Their names and interests 
are given on pages iii and iv, and a picture of the 
group (save for Moira Galbraith representing Dr. 
David Mackas) is shown below (Fig. 1).  Every 
participant provided an essay on aspects of 
subarctic Pacific oceanography that he or she is 
interested in investigating.  Those essays are 
presented here, with short introductions by the 
Workshop organizers, Drs. Charles B. Miller and 
Tsutomu Ikeda, to provide context.

A. ASPECTS OF PHYTOPLANKTON ECOLOGY IN THE SUBARCTIC PACIFIC 
 
Automated and semi-automated analyses of phytoplankton floristics should be particularly suitable for 
studies of phytoplankton in the subarctic Pacific.  In high-nitrate low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions, 
substantial fractions of Synechococcus and nano-eukaryotes in the phytoplankton will make abundance 
analyses by flowcytometry particularly valuable.  The analyses are quantitively precise and suitable for 
very high data frequencies.  Quantitative video-microscopy can also be used to good advantage for 
slightly larger classes of cells: haptophytes, prymnesiophytes, coccoid chlorophytes, very small diatoms 
and other nanophytoplankton.  In addition, particularly with epifluorescence arrangements, it can 
evaluate heterotrophic flagellate abundance, a key aspect of the ecosystem.  Dr. Karen Selph was invited 
to the Workshop to discuss the potential of these methods for OECOS. 
 
 
Microbial community compositions

As part of the effort to characterize the plankton 
community dynamics in the subarctic Pacific 
Ocean during OECOS, I propose to use a 
combination of flow cytometry and 
epifluorescence microscopy for abundance and 
biomass estimation of the microbial community. 
 
Three complementary methods of estimating 
microbial abundances will be used.  First, 
shipboard flow cytometry on freshly collected, 
live phytoplankton will allow immediate 
enumeration of two fluorescently-distinct groups: 
Synechococcus and photosynthetic eukaryotes.  
Using the cellular scatter signal collected by the 
flow cytometer, a rough estimate of cell size can 
also be obtained.  In addition, should rarer 
cytometrically-distinct populations appear, this on-
board method will allow more sample volume to 
be processed to get a statistically significant 
number of counts for the rare populations.  This 
instrument has been successfully employed during 
two other field projects to date:  in the Antarctic 
waters of the Drake Passage (Fig. 2) and in the 
equatorial Pacific. 
 
Another aliquot of sample will be preserved and 
frozen (LN
2
) for enumeration of non-pigmented 
bacteria on a land-based flow cytometer.  Given 
that one of the hypotheses for the lower limit of 
the phytoplankton abundance cycle is that 
microheterotrophs switch from consuming 
autotrophs to grazing on heterotrophs, 
enumeration of the non-pigmented bacteria will be 
important.  These samples will also provide a 
backup for phytoplankton abundance estimates.  
However, it is expected that the samples processed 
live will give somewhat higher numbers for 
phytoplankton relative to those preserved and 
frozen, as preservation tends to destroy some 
delicate cells. 
 
Finally, samples will also be taken for digital 
imaging by epifluorescence microscopy.  This will 
allow enumeration and biovolume estimation of 
both the pigmented and non-pigmented members 
of the microbial community.  In addition, if no 
other investigator is collecting samples for the 
abundance of ciliates, I will take acid Lugol’s 
samples for later analysis on land using an 
inverted microscope.  That would round out the 
community abundance picture. 
 
Methods 
 
Ship-board flow cytometry will be performed 
using a Beckman-Coulter EPICS XL, coupled 
with a syringe pump for quantitative sample 
delivery (a system similar to Selph et al. (2001)).  
Samples (50 ml) will be collected and run live 
within 2 h to estimate the abundance of 
phytoplankton.  Phytoplankton are distinguished 
on the basis of chlorophyll (red fluorescence, 680 
 
   
6 
nm), phycoerythrin (orange fluorescence, 575 nm) 
and by forward and 90° side-scatter signatures.  
Calibration beads (1 and 6 µm) are added to each 
sample as an internal standard for fluorescence.  In 
order to discern any diel or other time-varying 
patterns, this sampling will be repeated at a 
frequency of up to six profiles of 10 depths each 
per 24-h period.  Raw data (listmode files) will be 
processed using the software FlowJo (Treestar, 
Inc.). 
 
Land-based flow cytometry will be done on a 
Beckman-Coulter EPICS Altra flow cytometer 
equipped with multiple lasers and a syringe pump 
delivery system.  This instrument, which is part of 
a facility under my direction at the University of 
Hawaii (www.soest.hawaii.edu/sfcf), is optimized 
for the detection of picoplankton.  Samples will be 
taken and preserved (2 ml aliquots) on board ship, 
and then frozen.  Back on land, the samples will be 
thawed, stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 µg ml
–1
, 
v/v, final concentration), and incubated at room 
temperature in the dark for 1 h (Monger and 
Landry, 1993).  Aliquots (100 µl) will be analyzed 
for populations of phytoplankton and non-
pigmented bacteria, distinguished on the basis of 
chlorophyll (red fluorescence, 680 nm), 
phycoerythrin (orange fluorescence, 575 nm), 
DNA (blue fluorescence, 450 nm), and by forward 
and 90° side-scatter signatures.  Calibration beads 
(0.5 and 1.0 µm yellow-green beads and 0.5 µm 
UV beads) will be added to each sample as an 
internal standard for fluorescence.  Raw data will 
be processed as described for the live samples.

Also on board ship, samples will be taken for 
image analysis by epifluorescence microscopy to 
characterize the microbial community 
composition.  Cells in the nanoplankton size range 
(2–20 μm) will be enumerated from 50-ml 
samples preserved with paraformaldehyde (0.4% 
final concentration, v/v) and stained with 40 μl of 
0.033% (w/v) proflavin, a protein stain.  The 
samples will be concentrated on 1-µm, 25-mm 
black polycarbonate membrane filters and stained 
with DAPI (50 μg ml
-1
, final concentration) for 
0.5 min in the final stage of filtration.  Cells in the 
microplankton range (20–200 μm) will be counted 
from 250- or 500-ml samples preserved and 
cleared with sequential additions of alkaline 
Lugol’s fixative (0.1%, final concentration), 1% 
borate-buffered formaldehyde and 0.009% sodium 
isothiosulfate (protocol modified from Sherr and 
Sherr (1993)).  These samples will be stained with 
200 μl of proflavin, filtered onto 8-µm, 25-mm 
black polycarbonate membrane filters, and stained 
with DAPI (as above).  Filters from both 
preparations will be mounted on glass slides with a 
drop of immersion oil and viewed on shipboard 
with a video image analysis system before 
freezing at –80°C.  The video system consists of a 
Olympus BX51 epifluorescence microscope on an 
anti-vibration platform, a 100 W power supply, 
and a Microfire digital camera.  At least 30 
random images per slide will be digitized on 
shipboard and downloaded to a PC computer with 
Media Cybernetics Image Pro Plus software.  
Nanoplankton and micro-plankton will be viewed 
and imaged at 640X and 400X, respectively. 
 
Logistics 
 
These operations would require two people on 
board ship:  one person to run the flow cytometer 
and the other to make and image the 
epifluorescence microscope slides.  All major 
equipment (flow cytometers and epifluorescence 
microscope-imaging system) is available from my 
lab at the University of Hawaii.

The work Dr. Selph proposes would be an excellent characterization of short-term ecosystem variation, 
going far beyond just the chlorophyll data available in earlier studies.  The flow cytometry data can be 
available in real-time to help us track where we are in the cycle as observations go forward.  It is 
essential to effective ‘reactive’ planning during the cruises that most aspects of our results be 
progressively evident as we generate them, rather than emerging at some meeting a year or more after 
the observations at sea. 
 
An intriguing aspect of work in the central Gulf of Alaska is that the specific composition of the algal 
flora is different on every visit one makes, as shown by Beatrice Booth’s work in SUPER (Subarctic 
Pacific Ecosystem Research).  Phytoplankton are always predominantly picoplankton and nanoplankton 
(mostly less than 7–8 μm), but the dominant cells can be coccoid chlorophytes, any of the divisions of 
small flagellates, or even small diatoms.  We cannot fully understand what is happening without knowing 
what sorts of algae are operating around us; we cannot just measure chlorophyll.  We are likely to see 
transitions in phytoplankton composition, although we may not be able to explain such transitions when 
they occur.  However, they should be documented.  In this regard, Dr. Nicholas Welschmeyer proposes in 
the next essay to do ‘CHEMTAX’ high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) work on a twice 
daily basis aboard ship, with regularly posted results.  That would provide another dimension to the 
picture. 
 
It will be essential that growth rates of phytoplankton be estimated by up-to-date, reliable techniques that 
take full account of the impact of microheterotrophs in incubation bottles.  This is important, in part, 
because the trophic link from pico- and nanophytoplankton to protozoan grazers initiates transfer to 
larger organisms:  copepods, euphausiids, fish, squid, and mammals.  Nicholas Welschmeyer has 
developed a dilution technique using carbon-14 which seems ideally suited to high-nitrate low-
chlorophyll (HNLC) situations and thus to the core problems to be studied by OECOS.  At the Workshop 
he discussed these methods (and some other aspects of an approach to subarctic Pacific ecology).

Background 
 
The eastern subarctic Pacific is characterized year-
round by low surface chlorophyll concentrations, 
typically falling in the range 0.15–0.6 µg Chl l
–1
.  
The rare, large phytoplankton cells (diatoms) have 
been shown to be iron-limited.  However, the 
dominant small phytoplankton classes grow at 
moderate to high rates and are actively grazed by 
microzooplankton such that the bulk chlorophyll 
crop remains relatively constant (Miller et al., 
1991; Strom and Welschmeyer, 1991).  Under 
conditions of experimental in situ iron 
fertilization, the large diatom component will 
bloom (Harrison et al., 1999), however, natural 
iron fertilization events in the eastern subarctic 
Pacific are not known.  A primary goal of the 
collaborative OECOS project in the Gulf of 
Alaska is to define the conditions that control 
lower and upper limits of the phytoplankton 
community abundance under normal, iron-stressed 
conditions.  In particular, we seek to understand 
what sets the lower limit of roughly 0.15 µg Chl  
l
–1
 characteristic of the subarctic Pacific; 
effectively asking, “What prevents chlorophyll 
from being grazed away?” 
 
 
 
   
9
Since the range between upper and lower limits of 
chlorophyll concentration is relatively narrow, it 
could be argued that we are simply observing 
natural variability about a mean low value as is the 
case during the winter low of many planktonic 
environments.  However, as elaborated by Strom 
et al. (2000), the spring–summer subarctic algal 
biomass variation appears to be in a cycle, 
mirrored by inverse variation of regenerated 
ammonium concentration.  This implies grazing 
and nutrient cycling.  Strom et al. (2000) show 
that, while one explanation for the non-zero lower 
limit implies a minimum food threshold for the 
onset of grazing activity, the collection of 
laboratory feeding experiments shows no evidence 
for feeding thresholds in the micrograzers tested.  
In order to resolve the issue in the field, it is 
important to determine algal growth rates and 
microzooplankton grazing rates as accurately as 
possible at both upper and lower limits of Chl 
standing crop, while the cycle is in operation! 
 
Our proposed contribution to this effort is to 
deploy a series of analyses focusing on 
microzooplankton grazing rates, algal 
growth/production rates and compositional 
changes in the phytoplankton community.  All the 
methods proposed here are necessarily biased by 
analytical technique (radioisotopes, pigments, 
active fluorescence, oxygen, and total inorganic 
carbon (TCO
2
)), and they will need corroboration 
by more organismic methods (microscopy, 
FlowCam, and flow cytometry) that will be 
contributed by collaborators. 
 
14
C experiments   
 
We propose to deploy a new variant of the dilution 
experiment, which provides sensitive, carbon-
based estimates of community microzooplankton 
grazing.  The technique is based on measurement 
of the photosynthetic rate (
14
C uptake) determined 
in a conventional dilution series.  The method 
measures grazing rate on the basis of the time-
integrated effect of dilution on primary 
productivity, rather than on the net change in prey 
(measured usually as Chl) concentration, as in 
conventional dilution protocol.  One benefit of the 
14
C method is particularly important: the technique 
yields bulk community grazing rates without 
relying on Chl as an accurate tag for algal 
biomass.  It is well known that variable C/Chl 
ratios and variable grazer digestive efficiencies 
can wreak havoc on final grazing rate calculations 
when the experiments are based on net Chl 
changes.  Necessarily, when grazer degradation of 
Chl is not 100% efficient, the calculated rates must 
be regarded as conservative estimates of the true 
grazing rate (Waterhouse and Welschmeyer, 
1995).  Unfortunately, the absolute value of 
micrograzer Chl digestive efficiency is not known, 
so it cannot be controlled for in natural samples.  
These problems can be remedied by analyzing 
conventional dilution experiments on a prey-
specific basis (say, cytometrically enumerated 
Synechococcus sp., or fluorescently tagged prey 
analogs).  The bulk community grazing pressure 
would then have to be inferred from activity on 
specific prey items.  The 
14
C-uptake-based dilution 
experiment is proposed here as a method to obtain 
the bulk community grazing rate. 
 
Briefly, the dilution-normalized 
14
C-uptake rate is 
plotted against dilution (Fig. 3), yielding a curve 
which is best-fit to predict 1) the dilution-
corrected production rate in the absence of grazing 
(y-intercept) relative to 2) the production rate 
determined under ambient grazer/prey 
concentrations (dilution = 1.0).  The resulting 
grazer-influenced productivity ratio, G
r
, is 
combined in Eq. 1 (Fig. 3, top) to yield a 
numerical solution for g (d
–1
), the community 
grazing rate; the analytical relationship is 
summarized in Figure 3, bottom.  Application of 
this technique yields very high community grazing 
rates in Monterey Bay, the California Current, and 
in the oligotrophic Central North Pacific (Fig 4, 
upper right; g > 2.0 d
–1
).  The data provide clear 
verification that the well-acknowledged, but 
under-appreciated, grazer-mediated reminerali-
zation of 
14
C (as respiratory 
14
CO
2 
and dissolved 
organic 
14
C (DO
14
C) sloppy feeding/excretion) is 
real, and substantial, in every 
14
C incubation.  We 
are currently ‘correcting’ the derived grazing rates 
with the remineralization function of Laws (1984, 
2000) which takes into account grazer 
growth/assimilation efficiencies.  Even under 
those corrections we find, contrary to a recent note 
by Dolan and McKeon (2004), that Chl-based 
dilution experiments are likely to yield significant 
underestimates of grazing rates (Fig. 4, lower).

Fig. 3 Top:  Production-based estimates of microzooplankton grazing rates.  Principle: algal specific growth is 
density independent, but primary production (dP/dt = uP) is not.  Modeled calculations of primary production is at a 
constant algal growth rate of 0.5 d
–1
, but under four community grazing rates, g, all are subjected to dilution 
treatments. Bottom:  The shift in production on the right side of Figure 3 (top) is defined as G
r
, and is shown 
analytically in the bottom figure.  Experimental protocol: measure G

 empirically, then calculate g (d

), the 
community grazing rate. 
 
 
The production-based dilution method makes use 
of 
14
C estimates of production for one simple 
reason – sensitivity.  However, it can also be 
analyzed with conventional light–dark gross 
production measurements based on oxygen.  In 
that case, the method is free of radiotracer 
remineralization biases.  Table 1 gives results from 
Elkhorn Slough, California, where Chl levels are 
high enough to provide high-precision 
potentiometric end-point O
2
 determinations 
(Furuya, 1995) with an adequate signal.  
Production-based dilution grazing experiments at 
times were more than twice as high as side-by-
side, conventional, Chl-based dilution grazing

results (Table 1; Fig. 5).  Can we use an oxygen-
based technique in the subarctic Pacific?  In most 
cases, the answer will be no (not enough 
sensitivity).  However, when the subarctic 
chlorophyll cycle begins to approach the upper 
limit, ~0.5 μg Chl a l
–1
, we calculate a reasonable 
chance (with adequate replication) that a 48-h 
incubation could provide field calibration of the 
necessary ‘remineralization’ correction for the 
14
C 
version of the experiment.  We propose to deploy 
the 
14
C version of the experiment as the routine 
(daily) measure of community microzooplankton 
grazing rates (augmented by oxygen 
measurements when signal level allows).  
Additionally, we propose to provide high precision 
coulometric determinations of TCO
2 
(UIC Inc. 
CM5012 Coulometer) to be paired up with O

measurements, yielding appropriate photosynthetic

We propose to be responsible for routine 
measurements of primary productivity by 
14
C 
technique in the OECOS field work.  The 
measurements collected over the Subarctic Pacific 
Ecosystem Research (SUPER) program yielded 
significantly higher productivity than gathered on 
the Canadian Weathership program (Welschmeyer 
et al., 1993).  The more recent Canadian Joint 
Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) measurements 
show similar, or even slightly higher values, than 
derived in SUPER (Harrison et al., 1999).  We 
will apply the same procedures, including in situ 
water column incubations, to maintain historical 
continuity.  However, since we now know that 
more than 75% of water column integrated 
productivity takes place within the mixed layer 
(Welschmeyer et al., 1991), and that the 
manipulated iron fertilization experiments were 
essentially mixed-layer phenomena, it seems 
logical to simplify, and focus much of the 
laborious 
14
C experimental efforts on mixed-layer 
sampling, utilizing shipboard incubators 
simulating in situ conditions.  We have numerous 
rotating plankton wheels that hold all bottle sizes, 
from 125 ml to 2.7 l, to be used for all variants of 
the 
14
C dilution experiments proposed here: 1) 
14
C-
based grazing rates (discussed above), 2) algal 
 
   
13
growth rates determined by 
14
C labeling of 
pigments (Welschmeyer et al., 1991), and 
3) release of DO
14
C, in absolute rate and as a 
function of grazing. 
 
The last point regarding DO
14
C release requires 
some comment.  Karl et al. (1998) made it clear 
that large fractions of total net primary production 
were accounted for in the DO
14
C analyses made at 
the Hawaii Ocean Times-series (HOTS) project.  
That measurement was ignored in SUPER and in 
the more recent Canadian experiments.  However, 
we have determined in Monterey Bay that more 
than half the total released DO
14
C is due to 
microzooplankton grazing activity (sloppy 
feeding/excretion), not algal physiological release 
per se (Chevalier, 2001).  That result is based, 
again, on results from 
14
C dilution experiments.  
We will use the magnesium-induced co-
precipitation dissolved organic carbon (MAGIC 
DOC) adsorption procedure (Karl, 1998) in 
OECOS dilution experiments, searching for 
variability in the grazer-induced release of DO
14
C 
for two purposes:  1) to produce the most accurate 
measurements of total primary production that we 
can (particulate and dissolved) and 2) to identify 
possible links between the fresh release of labile 
DOC and potential increases in taxon-specific 
components of the phytoplankton community.   
 
The dilution-based 
14
C experiments will also be 
used to compute true net primary productivity, 
corrected for grazing-induced remineralization.  
Basically, if we again derive microzooplankton 
grazing rates similar to (or higher!) than measured 
during SUPER (0.3–0.5 d
–1
), it is reasonably safe 
to assume that all historical estimates of primary 
production in the subarctic Pacific, based on 24-h 
14
C incubations, are low because the grazer-
remineralized 
14
CO
2 
and DO
14
C were never 
accounted for; that error would be ca. 30–40%.  
Manipulations of the 
14
C-dilution experiment 
above can be used to produce ‘grazer-corrected’ 
estimates of the true net primary production rate. 
 
Active fluorescence 
 
In all of the proposed variants of the dilution 
experiment (ours and those of other OECOS 
investigators), we will eventually ask what kind of 
subjective nutrient addition (if any) should be 
made to our otherwise trace-metal clean treatment 
bottles (Landry et al., 1995).  (Who will keep our 
hands metal clean?)  We propose that at the end of 
each experiment, aliquots of all dilution samples 
be analyzed for dark-adapted estimates of 
photochemical efficiency, F
v
/F
m
, utilizing Walz 
Pulse Amplitude Modulated fluorescence 
instrumentation (Water PAM-FT) to check for 
uniformity in algal physiological condition across 
the dilution series.  Recall that a primary 
assumption of dilution protocol is that the algal- 
specific growth rate is density independent.  That 
same assumption holds for the 
14
C-dilutions 
described here. 
 
We also propose to set up in-line continuous 
monitoring of surface F
v
/F
m 
utilizing paired, flow-
through Water PAM-FT units, one with red 
excitation and one with blue excitation.  
Phytoplankton F
v

m
 response to iron limitation is 
well documented (Behrenfield et al., 1996), and 
surface, flow-through monitoring (especially at 
night) should be adequate to detect changes over 
the course of several weeks.  Moreover, contrary 
to popular belief, blue-excitation, active-
fluorescence instrumentation (such as the Chelsea 
Fast Repetitive Rate (FRR)) does not illicit 
uniform F
v
/F
m 
response for all phytoplankton 
groups, particularly picophytoplankton with 
phycobilins.  Figure 6 shows a recent transect 
through Monterey Bay, with paired red and blue 
PAM units, each recording twice per minute.  Data 
from a Chelsea FRR fluorometer on the same in-
line flow system were omitted for clarity; and all 
three instruments showed the same gross trends in 
F
v

m
 (note large variations which are inherent in 
daytime determinations subject to strong 
irradiance fluctuation).  However, the later 
samples (>14:00 h) were collected offshore (right 
side of plot) and they showed small, but consistent 
decreases in F
v
/F
m 
for blue excitation relative to 
red excitation.  Coincidentally, high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment 
calibration extractions along the transect showed 
that cyanophyte contributions increased from 5% 
to 20% of the total algal community as determined 
from CHEMTAX (zeaxanthin) analysis (Mackey 
et al., 1996).  We propose that similar fluctuations 
in the relative contributions of Synechococcus and 
continuous eukoryotes could be monitored in

The Water PAM fluorometers described above are 
new and are now sensitive enough for offshore 
oligotrophic work.  However, they are available in 
flow-through mode only; not for in situ 
deployment.  We propose to collect data from a 
CTD-mounted Chelsea FRR instrument for 
determination of depth-dependent changes in 
active fluorescence to check for depth-related 
variability in physiological condition, especially at 
the base of the mixed layer.  Data from the 
instrument could also be used to make real time 
fluorescence-based estimates of instantaneous 
production (Kolber and Falkowski, 1993).  
However, we consider vertical profiling of 
physiological fluorescence conditions (F
v

m 
and 
absorbance cross-section) to be more significant to 
the project than real-time instantaneous production 
calculations per se, given that 
14
C productivity will 
still serve as ground truth. 
 
Pigments    
 
Finally, we propose a CHEMTAX HPLC analysis 
of mixed-layer phytoplankton community 
structure during the full course of each cruise.  If 
the collaborative OECOS efforts do show that 
microzooplankton grazing rates indeed become 
reduced at the lower limits of observed 
chlorophyll cycling, we will, of course, ask, 
“why?”  Possibly there is a discernible, repeated 
shift in relative proportions of algal groups at the 
high and low ends of standing crop variation, 
leading to prey-selective threshold response (not 
yet found in the lab).  We have applied Simon 
Wright’s (Australian Antarctic Division, 
Tasmania) CHEMTAX analysis to gross 
distinctions in phytoplankton structure in the 
Monterey Bay area with reasonable success.  
Figure 7a shows examples of CHEMTAX analysis 
of algal community distinctions in Elkhorn Slough 
where the diatom/dinoflagellate-dominated lower 
portion of the slough is easily separated from the 
cryptophyte-dominated upper section.  Figure 7b 
shows stations separated by only a few hundred 
meters during the low-tide ebb of the Elkhorn 
Slough plume into Monterey Bay proper. 
The natural history of pigments in the subarctic 
Pacific is fairly simple; key diagnostic pigments 
include peridinin (dinoflagellates), 19-
butanoyloxyfucoxanthin (pelagophytes), fuco- 
xanthin (diatoms), 19-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin 
(prymnesiophytes), prasinoxanthin (prasino-
phytes), zeaxanthin (cyanophytes), and Chl b 
(prasinophytes/ chlorophytes).  We propose to take 
one or two reasonably foolproof HPLC systems to 
sea to provide daily postings of noon and midnight 
mixed-layer CHEMTAX composition for the 
duration of the cruise.  These HPLC systems

Evaluations of phytoplankton abundance, floristics, and production rates also must be done in the 
western subarctic Pacific.  Two approaches were presented at the OECOS Workshop.  An array of ship-
based techniques was suggested by Dr. Ken Furuya, and satellite-based estimates of phytoplankton 
standing stocks and production were evaluated by Dr. Sei-ichi Saitoh.  In the essay below, Dr. Furuya 
suggests that both floristic analyses (microscopy, CHEMTAX and flow cytometry) and evaluation of 
phytoplankton physiological status be accomplished by recently developed techniques.

Compared to the eastern side, the western 
subarctic Pacific is characterized by high 
variability in surface chlorophyll a concentration 
that is associated with diatom blooming (Shiomoto 
et al., 1998).  Phytoplankton bloom dynamics are 
central to OECOS in the western subarctic Pacific, 
and we propose diagnosis of the physiological 
status of phytoplankton as a component of 
OECOS based on the following background. 
 
Photosynthetic characteristics of phytoplankton 
during summer 
 
Geographical variability in the relationship 
between photosynthesis and irradiance was 
examined in the subarctic North Pacific Ocean in 
July–August 1997 and 1999.  Photosynthesis 
versus irradiance (P–E) curves were obtained for 
seawater that was collected by trace metal-clean 
techniques.  Most regions sampled during this 
study were characterized by high nutrients  
(> 8 μM nitrate) and low chlorophyll (0.2–0.6 μg 
l
–1
), except the western gyre in 1997, where 
chlorophyll concentrations of 1.3–3.0 μg l
–1
 were 
recorded. Ambient iron concentration at the 
surface was consistently subnanomolar during 
both years (<0.22 nM).  Surface chlorophyll a was 
statistically higher in the western gyre in 1997, 
while no difference was observed in 1999.  
Phytoplankton class composition, as revealed by 
CHEMTAX analysis of bio-marker pigments, was 
different between these regions in 1997 (Fig. 8).  
Maximum photosynthetic rates (P
B
m) varied 
between 1.79 and 5.24 mgC (mg chl)
 –1
 h
–1
 with no 
obvious geographical difference between the 
western and eastern gyres.  In contrast, there were 
noticeable east–west gradients in the initial slope 
of the P–E curves ( α
B
) for surface populations in 
1997:  Station P (50°N, 145°W), located in the 
eastern gyre had the lowest α
B
 (0.088 + 0.041 mgC 
(mg chl)
–1
 h
–1
 ( μmol m
–2
 s
–1
)
–1
, n = 3), and it 
increased westward.  In July 1999, no significant 
east–west gradient was seen in α
B
, which ranged 
between 0.012 and 0.029 mgC (mg chl)
–1
 h
–1
 
( μmol m
–2
 s
–1
)
–1
, while sporadically high α
B
 was 
observed in the western gyre area.  Bottle 
incubations conducted in 1999 with iron 
enrichment of 1–2 nM resulted in a significant 
enhancement of both α
B
 and maximum quantum 
yield (oceanic quantum yields in the subarctic 
Pacific are atypically low compared to Pacific 
coastal sites and the North Atlantic, Fig. 9).  This 
signifies the role of iron in controlling the 
productivity potential of phytoplankton.  These 
observations indicate that east–west gradients exist 
in algal photosynthetic activity, but that the 
gradients are not stable.  What is responsible for 
the difference? 
 
Subarctic Pacific Iron Experiment for 
Ecosystem Dynamics Study 
 
Limitations on natural iron fertilization and 
nitrogen concentrations that saturate uptake 
capacity at the surface lead to an hypothesis that 
iron availability controls bloom dynamics.  This 
was validated by large-scale iron fertilization 
experiments (Tsuda et al., 2003, 2005b).  
Interestingly, the second experiment conducted in 
2004 resulted in a different response of 
 
   
17
phytoplankton populations.  While the first 
experiment yielded a distinct growth of diatoms, 
the second one resulted in a much lower increase 
in chlorophyll a and less dominance of diatoms.  
What is responsible for the difference?  This is not 
fully explained, yet, but it indicates the importance 
of algal conditions before the experiments. 
 
Diagnosis of physiological status 
 
These observations demonstrate that it is crucial to 
examine the composition and physiological status 
of phytoplankton in order to analyze bloom 
dynamics and their environmental control.  A  
50-day long observation would be beneficial to 
allow us to monitor the whole span from pre-
blooming through the bloom-to-bloom 
termination.  We propose to conduct time-series 
observations to investigate bloom dynamics with 
emphases on 1) factors initiating blooming and  
2) the physiological conditioning of phytoplankton 
before the bloom.  Algal physiological status is 
diagnosed by active fluorescence to monitor light 
acclimation and iron stress, and by flow 
cytometry.  Since growth responses to 
environmental changes differ according to algal 
group, group-specific properties are requisite for 
insights to population dynamics.  Thus, we will 
apply a variety of techniques for taxonomic 
analysis of the algal community.  While there are 
limited numbers of measurements that 
successfully indicate physiologic status, flow-
cytometric techniques have been proposed for 
esterase activity, peroxidase activity, nitrate 
reductase induction, photosynthetic capacity, 
carbon-incorporation rate and membrane integrity.  
Many of these should be useful in OECOS studies.

Our proposed contributions are: 
 
1)  Bulk measurements for: 
a. continuous measurement of chlorophyll 
and primary production at a fixed depth by 
natural fluorescence (Yoshikawa and 
Furuya, 2004); 
b. Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) 
analysis of electron transport from PS-II to 
PS-I. 
2)  Group-specific properties, including: 
a. phytoplankton composition as revealed by 
microscopy for nano- and microplankton, 
flow cytometry for pico- and 
nanophytoplankton and CHEMTAX 
analysis of biomarker pigments for class-
specific composition; 
b. Flow cytometric diagnosis of algal 
physiological status. 
 
We will need to have close collaboration with 
other groups, in particular, with those working in 
bio-optics, trace metal chemistry, and nutrient 
dynamics. 
 
Temporal changes in these properties will be 
investigated during the 50-day observation from 
pre-blooming to its termination, because such 
observations can cover the time scales of episodic 
events, such as temporal stabilization of the water 
column, iron supply events, and continuously 
sunny days.  Since we need to differentiate 
biological and chemical processes from physical 
ones, areas with strong advection or high spatial 
variability in oceanic conditions should be 
avoided.  Selection of the study site is an issue of 
critical importance.

Satellite applications are more difficult in the subarctic Pacific than in many other ocean areas because 
of the extremely high frequency of cloudiness (>85%).  This is particularly hampering to analyses based 
on ocean color, although, as Dr. Sei-ichi Saitoh’s essay here demonstrates, the situation is not hopeless.  
Applications of microwave satellite techniques, such as scatterometry (wind proxies), sea surface 
altimetry and sea surface temperature (SST) could be of considerable value to OECOS, placing its time-
series observations in a spatially expansive evaluation of physical conditions.

Introduction 
 
Biogeochemical processes in the ocean play an 
important role in environmental changes. These 
processes are affected by the biological pump; 
hence, monitoring the variability of the 
distribution of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and primary 
production is a way of monitoring oceanic 
biogeochemical cycles.  The subarctic North 
Pacific represents one of the world’s most 
biologically productive regions. 
 
Ocean-color remote sensing is a useful new tool 
for continuously monitoring the temporal and 
spatial variability of chl-a concentration.  Past 
studies (Banse and English, 1994, 1999) have 
discussed phytoplankton seasonality in the western 
and eastern Pacific Ocean using Coastal Zone 
Color Scanner (CZCS) data sets.  Goes et al. 
(2001) discussed the impact of the recent El Niño 
event of 1997/1998 on the biological production of 
the North Pacific using satellite and ship data. 
Sugimoto et al. (2001) reported the features of El 
Niño events and their biological impacts in the 
western North Pacific. A recent comparative study 
on primary production in the Western Subarctic 
Gyre (WSG) and Alaskan Gyre (AG) focused on 
different effects of iron (Harrison et al., 1999). 
 
Results from Sasaoka et al. (2002) 
 
Ocean-color imagery clearly showed seasonal and 
interannual variability in the spatial abundance and 
distribution of chl-a in the study area.  Chl-a 
concentrations were generally low (0.24–0.537 mg 
chl m
–3
) for most of the year, except for a few 
peaks (1.0–2.0 mg chl m
–3
) observed in the spring 
and fall bloom seasons (May, June, September, 
and October).  Chl-a concentrations (>10 mg chl 
m
–3
) were consistently high along the Kuril Islands 
and in the coastal waters around the Kamchatka 
Peninsula, and in 1998 they were clearly higher 
than in 1999. 
 
The WSG was characterized by positive sea-
surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) during the 
summer to fall of 1998.  These anomalies appear 
to be a high-latitude response to the 1997/1998 
ENSO event.  High concentrations of chl-a 
appeared in the WSG from September to 
November, only, in 1998.  We suggest that the 
high chl-a around the WSG from summer to fall in 
1998 was facilitated by (1) negative SSTA in 
winter, despite the negative wind anomaly, which 
provided a larger amount of nutrients to the sea 
surface, (2) a  positive wind anomaly from April to 
June, which might cause light limitation of the 
phytoplankton growth, due to the deepening of the 
surface-mixed layer in summer, and (3) positive 
SSTA, even with the slightly positive wind 
anomaly, which was accompanied by water 
column stabilization and hence release from light 
limitation of the phytoplankton.  Warmer SST also 
might have enhanced the phytoplankton growth. 
During summer to fall in 1999, the phytoplankton 
biomass between 42°N and 43°N along 165°E was 
greater than in other years.  The enhanced chl-a 
concentration coincided with a distinct frontal 
temperature gradient located between 40°N and 
45°N in September 1998 and 1999.

Questions raised by Goes et al. (2004) 
 
• How important are winds in regulating 
biological production in the subarctic Pacific 
Ocean? 
• To what extent are winds responsible for the 
large west–east gradients in biological 
production in the subarctic Pacific Ocean?  
• How does their variable strength over seasonal 
and interannual scales impact biological 
production in the western and eastern parts of 
the subarctic Pacific? 
Approach 
 
Monthly fields of primary production are 
calculated using the vertically generalized 
production model (VGPM) of Behrenfeld and 
Falkowski (1997a,b) and Kameda and Ishizaka 
(2005).  Those models are validated using in situ 
measurement in this region. 
 
We will develop more accurate in-water 
algorithms for this region using the MODerate-
resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 
data sets.  Near-real-time satellite data will be 
provided for ship operation from the MODIS 
receiving and analysis station at Hokkaido 
University that has just started to receive MODIS 
data in the middle of March 2005.

A 
One of the main issues to be addressed by OECOS, at least in the eastern sector, is what drives the short- 
term variability of the phytoplankton standing stock.  Despite the consistently low stock levels,  
chlorophyll concentrations < 0.5 μg l
-1
, there are oscillations amounting approximately to a factor of 
three: 0.15 to 0.45 μg l
-1
.  These occur over periods of a week or more, up to 20 days (P.W. Boyd, 
unpublished fluorometer data from a mooring at Ocean Station P (OSP)), with very strong 
autocorrelation of successive measures in high-frequency time series (Fig. 10).  Similar variation, with 
similar periodicities, was observed by Bishop et al. (2002) with ‘carbon explorers’, free vehicles that 
obtain transmissometery profiles two to five times daily in the vicinity of OSP.  Upper water column light 
transmissivity can be converted to particulate organic carbon content with reasonable accuracy (Bishop, 
1999), and shows strong pulses in surface layers at 10- to 20-day intervals between April 10 and the end 
of May in 2001. 
 
The opposite phasing of chlorophyll and ammonia variations (Fig. 10C) is the best demonstration that 
they are driven by biological interactions.  Metabolic breakdown of phytoplankton (and other food-chain 
components) during chlorophyll decrease regenerates ammonia.  Ammonia is taken up during 
chlorophyll increase.  These are, of course, net changes resulting from modest differences between larger 
daily rates of plant growth and plant consumption.  Diel variations, up during daylight, down at night, 
are well demonstrated by the transmissometry data of Bishop et al. (2002).

These oscillations beg for detailed explanation, and Strom et al. (2000) have considered some of the 
possibilities.  There are others, and we will announce those recognized so far as we proceed through this 
report.  Among explanations for limitation of phytoplankton increase at the peaks of the cycle is iron 
limitation.  At some sufficiently low concentration, even the smallest phytoplankton would not have 
enough surface relative to cell mass to acquire an iron quota.  At that point, growth would slow and iron 
stress should become evident in the physiology of the cells.  Work along these lines is the specialty of  
Dr. Deana Erdner, an OECOS participant who contributed the next essay.  She also suggests application 
of fast repetition rate fluorometry (FRRf) to obtain F
v
/F
m 
as a measure of photosynthetic capability of 
electron transport systems.  That is very likely to be useful to OECOS, and it is also suggested by several 
other contributors to this report. 
 
 
The use of molecular indicators of phytoplankton iron limitation

My general area of interest and expertise is the 
physiological ecology of phytoplankton, primarily 
eukaryotic phytoplankton but including 
cyanobacteria and bacteria.  More specifically, my 
work has focused on the application and 
integration of molecular tools with traditional 
ecological techniques for understanding the factors 
that affect the distribution and growth of marine 
microbes in the environment, particularly nutrient 
stress. 
 
One aspect of my research to date has been the 
development of molecular markers for iron 
limitation in eukaryotic phytoplankton.  I used the 
presence and abundance of two proteins, 
ferredoxin and flavodoxin, to quantify the severity 
of iron stress.  Ferredoxin (Fd) and flavodoxin 
(Flv) are both redox proteins that catalyze the 
same step in photosynthetic electron transfer.  
Ferredoxin contains an Fe-S center, whereas Flv 
uses flavin mononucleotide as a cofactor to effect 
electron transfer.  My work and the work of others 
(LaRoche et al., 1995; Doucette et al., 1996; 
Erdner et al., 1999; McKay et al., 1999) 
demonstrated that when phytoplankton cells are 
iron replete, they utilize Fd for electron transfer.  
However, when cells become iron stressed, they 
replace the Fd with the functionally similar Flv, 
thereby decreasing their iron requirements (the 
amount of Fd in an iron-replete Thalassiosira 
weissflogii cell can account for about 40% of the 
total cellular iron quota).  It has been demonstrated 
that some organisms produce Flv constitutively 
while others do not produce it at all (Erdner et al., 
1999), but these seem to be the exception.  The 
presence of Flv has been used to demonstrate iron 
limitation in diatoms in the subarctic Pacific 
(LaRoche et al., 1996).  The relative abundance of 
the two proteins (the Flv index: [Flv]/[Fd + Flv]) 
was used as an index of the severity of iron 
limitation during the IronExII experiment in the 
equatorial Pacific (Erdner and Anderson, 1999), 
and in the Southern Ocean (Maucher and DiTullio, 
2003). 
 
For the proposed OECOS project, I am interested 
in monitoring changes in the iron nutritional status 
of the phytoplankton community on short time 
scales.  Field studies to date have used samples 
collected several days apart, providing rather 
coarse resolution.  The physiological response of 
the phytoplankton occurs much more rapidly; 
diatoms are capable of switching to Fd synthesis, 
accompanied by complete degradation of Flv 
protein, within 24 hours after iron resupply 
(Erdner, 1997; McKay et al., 1999).  The response 
of other physiological processes is even faster, 
with photosynthetic efficiency (as F
v
/F
m
) 
responding on the scale of hours.  This has been 
observed both in the laboratory (Erdner, 1997; 
McKay et al., 1999) and in the field (Erdner and 
Anderson, 1999), where cells show near-maximal 
F
v
/F
m
 but still express only Flv.  It appears that Fd 
may be the ‘first thing to go’, and the last to 
return, when cells become iron-stressed. 
 
 
   
23
Because the limit cycles observed in the eastern 
subarctic Pacific have periods as short as 6–10 
days, it would be desirable to monitor the iron 
status of the phytoplankton on a daily basis.  The 
amplitude of the cycle is likely to be influenced by 
both phytoplankton growth (and therefore 
limitation) and grazing.  Protistan grazing has been 
demonstrated to regenerate iron that can be used 
by phytoplankton (Barbeau et al., 1996), thus 
grazing itself can play a role in relieving the iron 
limitation of the phytoplankton community.  We 
can envision a scenario in which, at the ‘top’ of 
the limit cycle, phytoplankton biomass has 
reached its maximum, due to limitation by iron, 
which slows their growth and allows grazing to 
exceed growth.  As grazing continues, biomass 
decreases, but at the same time the grazing 
regenerates iron for the phytoplankton.  This 
allows the phytoplankton to grow faster, until the 
point where growth exceeds grazing (the ‘bottom’ 
of the limit cycle).  The physiological status of the 
phytoplankton will be quite dynamic throughout 
this cycle, and measurements such as F
v
/F
m
 and 
the Flv index could reveal the changes that are 
occurring.   
 
To date, field measurements of Fd and Flv have 
relied on detection of the proteins, using either 
antibodies (LaRoche et al., 1996) or high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with 
spectrophotometric detection (Erdner and 
Anderson, 1999; Maucher and DiTullio, 2003).  
The antibodies are very specific, with the only 
available antisera being reactive to diatoms alone.  
HPLC methods detect proteins from all taxa, but 
require large sample volumes (100s of liters) in 
order to extract sufficient protein for analysis.  
This limits the sampling resolution, but more 
importantly, hinders the ability to look at 
responses in different parts of the phytoplankton 
community.  For the OECOS work, it will be 
possible to use at least the HPLC methods for 
analysis.  A desirable modification would be the 
use of size fractionation to gain information on 
differential responses to iron amongst 
Synechococcus, picoeukaryotes, nanoplankton, 
etc.  This could be achieved through the use of 
sequential filtration using both nitex and glass 
fiber filters (142 mm diameter). 
 
Greater sensitivity and resolution could be 
achieved through methods targeting genes 
encoding Fd and Flv.  Very little work has been 
done in this area, primarily due to the lack of gene 
sequences for Flv.  However, with the advent of 
full genome sequences for a number of marine 
phytoplankton (Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus, 
Trichodesmium, Crocosphaera, Thalassiosira 
pseudonana, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and 
Emiliania huxleyi), as well as expressed sequence 
tag libraries for diatoms (Pseudo-nitzschia 
multiseries) and dinoflagellates (Alexandrium 
tamarense, Alexandrium ostenfeldii and Karenia 
brevis), sequences for both Fd and Flv are now 
available for a variety of taxa.  These sequences 
provide information with which the homologous 
sequences can be isolated from other species.  If 
the genes are regulated in the same fashion as the 
proteins, then measurement of gene expression 
could provide a sensitive and specific way of 
determining Fd and Flv levels, and the assay could 
be tailored to provide data on different taxonomic 
or functional groups.  This approach obviously 
needs to be verified and developed for use in 
natural populations.  The work to achieve this has 
just begun in our laboratory, and will be the topic 
of future proposed research.  It is possible that 
such an approach could be available for use in a 
few years.

B. IRON CONCENTRATION AND CHEMICAL SPECIATION 
 
If iron is sometimes limiting and sometimes not, it will be essential to OECOS, on both sides of the 
Pacific, to have accurate estimates of iron concentration and chemical speciation.  Recent work 
(reviewed in Shaked et al. (2005). Limnol. Oceanogr. 50: 872–882) suggests some of the complexity of the 
uptake process and its interaction with organic iron-binding siderophores in seawater.  OECOS will need 
sophisticated chemists to correctly characterize variations in iron availability to support phytoplankton 
growth within this array of complex chemistry.  Drs. Zanna Chase, Jay Cullen and Kenshi Kuma will 
contribute this sophistication to OECOS.  Their essays follow.

One of the hypotheses to be explored during 
OECOS is that iron limitation sets the upper limit 
of the observed phytoplankton variations. 
Measurements of total dissolved iron, iron 
speciation, and physiological indicators of iron 
stress are needed.  We describe sampling and 
analysis of iron, as well as ideas about additional 
measurements that would be relevant to the 
question of the influence of iron in this system. 
 
Sampling considerations 
 
The key to any successful field campaign 
involving iron measurements is the clean 
collection of samples.  Surface waters can be 
cleanly collected by pumping through tubing 
attached to a towed body deployed outside the 
ship’s wake.  To avoid contamination from the 
ship, this approach necessitates that the ship 
always be moving through the water.  This would 
be the most convenient way of collecting samples, 
as the clean sample stream could be directed 
straight into the analytical instruments, which 
greatly reduces the chance for contamination. 
Alternatively, samples could be collected 
manually by Zodiac trip.  
 
We also need at least one profile per day with a 
dedicated CTD-rosette deployed on conducting, 
plastic-coated cable.  Sample bottles are typically 
Go-Flos.  We recently saw such a system (jointly 
owned by Dr. Christopher Measures, University of 
Hawaii, and William Landing, University of 
Florida) deployed during an iron intercomparison 
cruise (Sampling and Analysis of Iron – SAFe) in 
the Pacific (Fig. 11).  It collected a full profile to 
1000 m depth in about 1 hour.  Samples were 
clean.  This approach is much faster than hanging 
Go-Flos off Kevlar line.  Dr. Jay Cullen was 
funded in April 2005 to build such a rosette 
system.  It is likely that this rosette will be 
available for the OECOS study. 
 
A dedicated, clean analytical and sampling van 
would be ideal for sampling from the Go-Flos and 
for the iron analyses.  Again, Dr. Measures has an 
ideal system that could serve as a model (Fig. 12). 
Dr. Cullen may also soon have access to such a 
facility.  
 
Iron speciation measurements 
 
Total dissolved Fe  
 
By this we mean iron in a 0.2 μm-filtered sample 
treated in such a way as to release all iron from 
organic ligands, and to dissolve all colloids. 
Typically this is achieved by acidification to  
pH < 2 or by UV treatment.  Many at-sea 
techniques exist.  If we sample by continuous 
 
   
26
surface pumping we would probably use a flow 
injection analysis technique, such that samples can 
be directed straight into the analytical system, with 
minimal handling.  Dr. Chase has experience with 
colorimetric and chemiluminescence techniques, 
both of which performed well during the recent 
SAFe intercomparison exercise. The electro-
chemical techniques used to measure iron 
speciation (see below) can also be used at sea to 
measure total dissolved iron.  
 
Fe(II) 
 
It is more soluble than Fe(III), more readily 
available to phytoplankton, and it may exhibit 
diurnal cycles associated with photoreduction.  
Fe(II) may also be elevated in response to aerosol 
or rain events.  We would probably use some 
version of the spectrophotometric or chemi-
luminescent (Bowie et al., 2002) methods already 
published.  For these measurements, it is very 
important to run the sample as soon as possible 
after collection.  This analysis may not be critical, 
but would be interesting.

the University of Hawaii clean van.  The 12 bottles are 
racked on either side of the van and filtration is 
accomplished through clean-air pressure 
 
 
Organically complexed Fe   
 
The concentrations of ligand-bound iron (FeL) and 
total inorganic iron (Fe ′) will be determined by 
competitive ligand equilibration/adsorptive 
cathodic stripping voltammetry (Gledhill and Van 
den Berg, 1994; Rue and Bruland, 1995), using the 
competing ligand 2-(2-Thiazolylazo)-p-cresol. 
(Croot and Johansson, 2000).  Dr. Cullen has 
extensive experience in the analysis of trace 
metals in seawater and marine particles.  The 
measured concentrations of Fe
T
, Fe ′, and FeL will 
then allow us to calculate the concentration and 
conditional stability constants of total excess 
dissolved iron binding ligand (L
T
) in the seawater. 
 
Colloidal Fe  
 
It could be determined by ultrafiltration (0.02 µm), 
but this is labor intensive and would need to be 
justified scientifically. 
 
Particulate Fe 
 
This would tell us how much iron is associated 
with particles.  If some assumptions are made 
about the lithogenic contribution, it is possible to 
estimate biological ‘metal quotas’ using these 
samples.  Alternatively, samples can be washed to 
remove extracellular metals (Tovar-Sanchez et al., 
 
   
27
2003).  Samples would be collected from the Go-
Flos onto cleaned filters and stored for future 
analysis by Inductively coupled Plasma-Mass 
Spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Cullen and Sherrell, 
1999). 
 
Archived samples  
 
These would be collected and acidified such that 
multi-element ICP-MS techniques could be used 
to measure a suite of other bio-active metals (Zn, 
Co, Cu, Mn, and Cd).  As ship-based methods 
exist for many of these metals, it would also be 
possible to measure them at sea, but this would 
involve trade-offs in time and space allocations, so 
this idea should be discussed. 
 
Monitoring phytoplankton iron stress 
 
Fast repetition rate fluorometry (FRRf) provides a 
very sensitive measure of phytoplankton 
photosynthetic competency.  During all of the iron 
addition experiments, the FRRf was the first 
instrument to pick up a response to iron addition.  
 
A series of quick, ‘bioassay’ incubations could be 
performed to assess iron stress in the 
photosynthetic community.  Briefly, samples 
(500 ml?) would be collected from the clean 
sampler and incubated in the presence and absence 
of added iron for 12–24 hours (or possibly less 
time – this is to be determined).  They would then 
be assayed for photosynthetic competency with 
FRRf.  The ratios of the responses in the with Fe 
and without Fe treatments would provide an 
indications of iron stress.  This method should be 
much more sensitive than looking for a growth 
response (e.g., chlorophyll) and multiple assays 
per day could be run.  
 
Quantifying iron inputs 
 
This would also be a wonderful opportunity to 
study aerosol iron inputs.  The eastern North 
Pacific does experience episodic iron enrichment 
from Asian dust storms (Bishop et al., 2002).  A 
ship stationed at a single point for 50–60 days 
would enable us to provide unique measurements 
of the aerosol input to this area.  Coupling these 
measurements to the in-water measurements of 
iron and iron speciation would tell us much about 
the delivery of iron to the surface of the ocean. 
Thus we should consider including daily collection 
of aerosol samples, and collection of rain when 
possible.  Dr. Chase has had some experience with 
aerosol collection on land, and could consult with 
experts on how this is done at sea. 
 
   
28
Underway sampling with a towed body will likely be possible during OECOS time-series work, but only 
when other over-side or net towing activities allow it.  Thus, there might be several underway iron 
samplings each day.  We could steam off in a suitable direction from a defined time-series station, which 
would be a drifter location or geographic position.  This would be the time for air sampling as well, since 
air sampling is very difficult, at least in light winds when sitting still in a ship’s diesel cloud.  Air 
sampling takes a tower on the bow to reduce the amount of sea spray included in samples (still 
substantial).  The ship must move upwind to ensure that the sampler will be upwind of the stacks.  Clean 
rain on a ship is very difficult to obtain, but perhaps we can find a way (sampling balloons?).   
 
The Go-Flo rosette system will need a dedicated winch.  We will need counts for both east and west 
OECOS vessels of the number of dedicated winches required.  We do not want to be changing out cables 
to different instruments.   So far, we see needing at least: 
• CTD and nutrient/chlorophyll rosette 
• Iron rosette 
• Multiple plankton net 
• Any underway profiling system (Timothy Cowles’ work in the east) 
 
More sampling equipment may be required, but attention to minimizing this number and preparation to 
provide specialty winches is in order.   
 
 
The measurement of iron, nutrients and other chemical components in the 
northwestern North Pacific Ocean

For the OECOS project, I am interested in 
monitoring iron (total, dissolved, and other forms), 
nutrients, and other chemical components in the 
surface waters (0–300 m depth) throughout the 
vertical water mixing during late winter (1), the 
spring phytoplankton bloom after water column 
stabilization (2), and the end of spring bloom (3) 
when: 
 
• Vertical water mixing during winter transports 
iron and nutrients to the surface layer. 
 
• Upward transport of iron and other nutrients 
during water mixing induces the spring 
phytoplankton bloom after water column 
stabilization. 
 
• Change of iron, nutrients and phytoplankton 
species occurs during the spring phytoplankton 
bloom. 
Sampling methods 
 
Seawater samples need to be collected in the 
surface waters (0–300 m depth) on a daily basis in 
the northwestern North Pacific Ocean by use of 
acid-cleaned, Teflon-coated, 10-liter Niskin X 
sampling bottles (General Oceanics) attached to a 
CTD-RMS, or on Kevlar line.  Sample filtration 
for analyses of labile dissolved Fe (<0.22 µm) 
concentrations, Fe(III) hydroxide solubility, and 
humic-type fluorescence intensity is carried out by 
connecting an acid-cleaned 0.22-µm pore size 
Durapore membrane filter (Cartridge type-
Millipak 100, Millipore) to a sampling bottle 
spigot and then filtering with gravity filtration. 
Unfiltered samples are collected for total 
dissolvable Fe, Chl a, and nutrient concentrations. 
The unfiltered and filtered seawater (100 ml in 
precleaned 125-ml, low density polyethylene  
(LDPE)) used for dissolvable (unfiltered) and 
labile dissolved (<0.22 µm) Fe concentration 
 
   
29
analyses is buffered at pH 3.2 with 10 M formic 
acid–2.4 M ammonium formate buffer solution 
(0.5 ml per 100-ml sample solution) in a class 100 
clean-air bench on board as soon as the samples 
are collected.  The buffered samples (pH 3.2) are 
kept at room temperature for 1–2 months until Fe 
analysis is conducted in the laboratory (Takata et 
al., 2004).  
 
Analytical methods 
 
Iron concentration 
 
The Fe concentration in each buffered sample is 
determined by an automated Fe analyzer (Kimoto 
Electric Co. Ltd.) using a combination of chelating 
resin concentration and luminol-hydrogen 
peroxide chemiluminescence (CL) detection in a 
closed flowthrough system (Obata et al., 1993). 
Briefly, Fe in a buffered sample solution is 
selectively collected on 8-quinolinol immobilized 
chelating resin and then eluted with dilute 0.3 N 
HCl.  The eluent is mixed with luminol solution, 
0.6 N aqueous ammonia and 0.7 M H
2
O
2
 solution 
successively, and then the mixture is introduced 
into the CL cell.  Finally, the Fe concentration is 
determined from the CL intensity. 
  
Fe(III) hydroxide solubility and humic-type 
fluorescence intensity 
 
The frozen 0.22-µm-filtered samples are thawed 
and warmed to room temperature (18°C) in a clean 
room (dark condition) overnight before the start of 
the experiments for Fe(III) solubility and humic-
type fluorescence intensity.  The Fe(III) solubility 
(20°C) in the defrosted filtered seawater sample at 
each depth is determined by a simple filtration 
(0.025-µm Millipore cellulosic membrane filter) 
involving γ-activity measurement of 
59
Fe(III) after 
adding radioactive 
59
Fe(III) into the seawater 
sample, as reported in previous studies (Kuma et 
al., 1996; Nakabayashi et al., 2001; Tani et al., 
2003; Takata et al., 2004).  Just after the frozen 
samples (10 ml in a polypropylene tube) are 
thawed and warmed overnight to room 
temperature in the dark, the humic-type 
fluorescence intensity is measured in a 1-cm 
quartz cell with a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence 
spectrophotometer at 320-nm excitation and 420-
nm emission, using 10-nm bandwidths (Hayase 
and Shinozuka, 1995).  
 
 Chl a and nutrient concentrations  
 
The concentrations of size-fractionated Chl a (0.2, 
2, and 10 µm) at each depth (5- to 150-m depth) 
are determined by the fluorometric method using 
N, N-dimethylformamide extraction (Suzuki and 
Ishimaru, 1990).  Major nutrient concentrations 
are determined using a Technicon autoanalyzer. 
Hydrographic data (salinity, temperature and 
depth) are obtained using a CTD. 
 
 
 
 
Dr. Kuma proposes to take on basic major nutrient (NO
3
, NH
4
, Si(OH)
4
, PO
4
) determinations for the 
Western OECOS Group.  The Eastern Group has not dealt with this issue, but views high-frequency 
nutrient, temperature, and salinity profiles as quite readily generated through a service function.  This 
will require suitable contract arrangements for provision of this data, and chemists with appropriate 
auto-analyzer equipment aboard.  Apart from nutrient drawdown over the course of the time series, we do 
not associate any cutting-edge questions with the acquisition of these essential background data.

C. PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY, FINE-SCALE DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS 
AND AUTONOMOUS DRIFTERS 
 
In regard to the physical setting, apart from frequent CTD/rosette profiling of the water column, it is 
anticipated that both western and eastern OECOS time series could benefit from (1) high-frequency data 
telemetered to a ship from drifters defining the station locations and (2) frequent characterization of the 
vertical fine structure of physical and biological features of the water column.  Most importantly, the 
drifter would provide continuity to chlorophyll and surface physical data during any intervals that 
shipboard work is shut down by stormy weather.  High-resolution bio-optical profiles would identify 
vertically restricted layers of very high concentration that are seen in many ocean areas, and would 
possibly explain how zooplankton find enough food in systems seen at low resolution as trophically very 
dilute, while spectral absorbance profiles would give us phytoplankton data equivalent to a limited 
CHEMTAX analysis, but with centimeter-scale resolution.  It is not certain what we will learn from that, 
but certainly it will be something.  Drifters are addressed in an essay by Dr. Peter Strutton and bio-
optical profiling in another by Dr. Timothy Cowles.  The bio-optical profiling will also contribute much 
of the small-scale data on mixing processes that we will need to interpret distributional patterns in 
OECOS work.

Drifter design and general comments 
 
Figure 13 illustrates the design that was used by 
the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute 
(MBARI) team during the Southern Ocean Iron 
Experiment (SOFeX).  I use it as an example 
because I have personal experience with it.  The 
drifter was relatively easy to deploy off the stern 
of the vessel, through the A-frame, but it was 
difficult to recover – we lost two holey sock 
drogues in the screws.  The drifter also 
experienced significant slippage, perhaps because 
of high winds and a relatively large surface 
expression.  Adding a second holey sock drogue 
(i.e., to increase subsurface drag) did not do much 
to reduce slippage.  The ‘disposable’ optics-only 
drifters (Mark Abbott, Oregon State University) 
that we deployed had a very small surface 
expression and anecdotal evidence suggests they 
did not slip as much (they stayed with the N patch, 
but that patch became very large, so maybe that 
was not such a difficult feat). 
 
The size of the surface float of the MBARI drifters 
was largely determined by the packet radio 
antenna (communications with the ship), GPS 
antenna, CO
2
 air intake, and above-water 
radiometer.  The logger/controller canister was not 
watertight enough to be mounted underwater; it 
was about 30 cm in diameter, so it increased the 
size of the surface expression.  The float itself was 
almost 1 m in diameter.

Instruments 
 
The MBARI SOFeX drifters were deployed (Fig. 
14) with the following instruments (see the cage 
mounted beneath the float in Fig. 15): 
• MBARI In Situ Ultraviolet Spectrometer 
(ISUS) optical nitrate sensor.  At the time, 
these were made at MBARI, but they are now 
commercially available from Satlantic Inc. for 
about $30,000 (or maybe a little less). 
• MBARI CO
2
 system, built by Gernot 
Friederich’s lab.  These are not commercially 
available, but it might be possible to buy one 
from MBARI for less than $20,000.  
• HOBILabs hydroscat instruments are intended 
to measure fluorescence and scattering.  I have 
recently had success in the Labrador Sea with 
WETLabs fluorometers and VSF (volume 
scattering function) instruments.  They are 
relatively small, easy to operate, and collect 
excellent data (http://bioloc.oce.orst.edu/ 
strutton/research_labsea.htm). 
• SeaBird MicroCAT 37-SM CT package (P 
optional, but not necessary for drifters). 
• SeaBird SBE43 O
2
 sensor. 
• Satlantic OCR radiometer (7 wavelengths of 
upwelling radiance, Lu).  A single wavelength 
irradiance (Ed490) sensor was mounted at the 
top of one of the antennas. 
• GPS and packet radio communications were 
mounted on the surface float. 
 
Which of these instruments would be important 
for OECOS? 
 
The answer to this question should probably be 
guided by the parameters we wish to measure 
when the ship is unable to sample due to weather. 
 
CO
2
 was essential for the SOFeX drifter, since one 
of the parameters we were trying to quantify was 
drawdown of CO
2
 as a result of Fe fertilization 
(Fig. 16).  My feeling is that we are likely to 
observe less significant (less important?) 
fluctuations in CO
2
 during OECOS.  This is a 
point for discussion. 
 
Nitrate fluctuations were also observed during 
SOFeX, and were helpful for determining budgets.  
In OECOS we are likely to observe progressive 
drawdown of nitrate through the course of the 
spring transition.  Probably this need not be 
represented by really high-frequency and gapless 
data, and, since the sensors are expensive, nitrate 
should likely be left to shipboard analysis.

 drawdown, measured by the drifter, after Fe fertilization of the SOFeX south patch.  The magnitude 
of the drawdown observed from underway ship-based measurements was of the same magnitude. 
 
   
35
Chlorophyll is essential, can be easily determined 
via fluorescence (even with the considerable daily 
variability in many parts of the ocean), and the 
sensors are cheap (less than $5,000). 
 
Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) can be 
determined by backscatter or beam attenuation. 
Again, these sensors are cheap (less than $5,000). 
Making the connection to POC requires calibration 
samples to be taken, but this will likely be done 
anyway. 
 
Temperature, salinity and O
2
 sensors are all 
relatively inexpensive and should be standard 
equipment for any drifter.  T and S help to indicate 
any slippage of the drifter into different water 
masses, and O
2
 helps determine chemical budgets. 
 
Upwelling radiance measurements might be 
added, but they are somewhat redundant if we 
already have chlorophyll measurements.  Standard 
radiometers have wavelengths at roughly the 
SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 
670 and 683 nm).  Band ratio algorithms (usually 
443 nm/555 nm) can be used to get chlorophyll, 
but they do not work any better than fluorescence. 
The 683-nm channel can be used to derive a 
measure of photosynthetic efficiency (Abbott and 
Letelier, 1998). 
 
Irradiance sensors (above-water) can complement 
the in-water radiance measurements, but the ship 
will measure irradiance underway. 
Hardware, electronics and communications 
 
For the MBARI drifters, all instruments were 
connected to a central controller (Chavez et al., 
1997).  The advantage of this is that subsets of 
data can be transmitted to the ship when packet 
radio connections are made.  If the drifter is never 
recovered, then at least the data are saved.  It also 
permits monitoring of the data, so if an instrument 
goes bad, the drifter can be recovered and the 
problem can be fixed.  In reality, recovery might 
not happen except for major failures. 
 
The disadvantage of this centralized controller 
system is that it requires significant hardware and 
software support.  A simpler option might be to 
have each instrument, or groups of instruments, 
internally record data, which can be downloaded 
after recovery. 
 
For locating the drifter, a minimum requirement 
(possibly sufficient for slow current regimes) 
would be an ARGOS transmitter.  It can transmit 
positions several times per day via satellite to an  
e-mail account (on the ship).  ARGOS works well 
at most latitudes.  During SOFeX we found that 
the GPS unit that was reporting to the controller 
often failed, and at least one drifter package was 
nearly lost because of this.  It is likely this was a 
symptom of working at high latitudes (poor 
satellite coverage).  A strobe light really helps for 
finding the drifter in fog or at night. 
 
 
OECOS projects would certainly want radio transfer of drifter data to the ships at short intervals so that 
characterization of the habitat is continuously available.  Some of the variables that Dr. Strutton lists, as 
measured in earlier drifter work, can also be measured for the mixed layer aboard ship during rough 
weather, using water from clean intake lines:  nutrients (even iron), CO
2
, chlorophyll, and salinity.  A 
drifter, then, might be asked to get data from several levels, even quite deep ones.  As Dr. Cowles’s essay 
points out below, we do not have very good understanding of shear in flow among layers in the open 
subarctic, so that the effect of a long drogue line with multiple instrument packages cannot be 
determined.  It will be important that drifters not eat the entire OECOS budget, and that the drifter 
projects have about the same general cost as most other component projects. 
 
Dr. Strutton says that nitrate data are expensive.  In the subarctic Pacific nitrate changes slowly over the 
seasonal time scale, whereas ammonia concentration variation is rapid (time scales of days with changes 
in both directions) and much more interesting.  We need to work toward the development of a drifter-
mountable ammonia analyzer.

The onset of surface warming in early spring 
initiates a 2-layer system above the permanent 
halocline (Denman and Gargett, 1988), with 
Neocalanus plumchrus and N. flemingeri 
concentrated above a shallow pycnocline (~40 m), 
and N. cristatus and Eucalanus bungii 
concentrated between that shallow pycnocline and 
the seasonal pycnocline (~100–150 m) (Mackas et 
al., 1993; confirmed by Goldblatt et al., 1999).  
 
Work from the Subarctic Pacific Ecosystem 
Research (SUPER) program at Ocean Station P 
(OSP) indicated that wind forcing sustains 
moderate to high turbulence in the shallow surface 
mixed layer, with little penetration of that energy 
below the shallow (temporary) pycnocline.  This 
barrier to mixing creates two distinct physical 
environments within the upper 100 m, and appears 
to support distinct ecological relationships in these 
respective depth ranges (e.g., Mackas et al., 1993).  
Finally, it appears that these two upper 
‘ecological’ intervals are effectively isolated from 
mixing with the waters below the permanent 
pycnocline (maintained by a halocline, ~32–33 
pss).  Denman and Gargett (1988) argued that the 
strong stratification created by the permanent 
pycnocline (100–150 m) prevented realistic 
estimates of vertical flux of nutrients (or other 
passive tracers) through the pycnocline.   
 
The ecological interactions within and between 
these distinct intervals clearly contribute to the 
unique temporal patterns in phytoplankton, protist, 
and mesozooplankton abundance seen in this 
region of the subarctic Pacific (e.g., Miller et al., 
1991; Strom et al., 2000).  Among the many 
compelling questions raised by these patterns, I am 
particularly interested in understanding the link 
between the vertical scales of physical processes 
and the corresponding vertical patterns in 
biological distributions.  
 
Eastward flow dominates the OSP region (e.g., 
Warren and Owens, 1988) throughout the 4000-m 
water column.  General upper ocean conditions 
have been described by many authors – see 
Whitney and Freeland (1999) for a recent 
summary of the region.   Considerable data exist 
on the surface flow (~10 cm s
–1
) near OSP (e.g., 
Niiler and Paduan, 1995; Bograd et al., 1999, 
based on drifters), and the vertical structure of the 
velocity field at OSP was documented in late 
August 1977 during the Mixed Layer Experiment 
(MILE; Davis et al., 1981), and again in 1987 by 
the Ocean Storms experiment (several papers in 
Journal of Physical Oceanography 1995, 25(11)), 
but there is a shortage of data with good vertical 
resolution of the velocity structure.  Davis et al. 
(1981) observed shears within the upper 50 m of 
0.01–0.05 s
–1
 over vertical intervals of 3 m.  
D’Asaro et al. (1995) report roughly equivalent 
shear values for the base of the seasonal 
pycnocline, but those values represent storm 
conditions.  The microstructure profiles discussed 
by Denman and Gargett (1988) indicated 
significant vertical shear at the base of the 
permanent pycnocline (based on instrument tilt), 
but that shear was not sufficient to induce local 
small-scale vertical mixing.  Davis et al. (1981) 
estimated that conditions favorable to small-scale 
mixing were infrequent in August 1977. 
 
These apparent vertical gradients in shear 
resemble those we have observed off the coast of 
Oregon using a free-fall vertical profiling system 
(Cowles, 2003) that resolves vertical hydrographic 
and bio-optical structure on scales of 2–4 cm (see 
Fig. 17).  We find that steep gradients in density 
often have steep gradients in vertical shear, 
confined within a 1–2 m depth interval near the 
density gradient.  Local maxima (or extremely 
steep gradients) in phytoplankton abundance often 
occur near these shear gradients, creating a vertical 
distribution pattern that could be described as 
 
   
37
‘vertically patchy’ for grazers. These steep 
gradients in phytoplankton persist for many hours, 
creating significant vertical heterogeneity in food 
resources for micrograzers and localized zones 
with high growth potential for those micrograzers.

Previous work at OSP suggests that the vertical 
patterns in microzooplankton abundance largely 
define the distribution and grazing patterns of  
N. plumchrus and N. flemingeri (Mackas et al., 
1993; Dagg, 1993a; Gifford, 1993; Strom et al., 
1993).  It is reasonable to hypothesize that the 
vertical pattern of microzooplankton abundance is 
strongly correlated to the pattern of phytoplankton 
abundance.  The vertical structure of the 
phytoplankton pattern, and its relationship to 
finescale physical processes, has not yet been 
resolved on small enough vertical scales to address 
this interplay between physics and biology in the 
subarctic Pacific (e.g., Boyd and Harrison, 1999).   
 
My research interests within OECOS are 
motivated by the opportunity to address several 
questions that arise from these earlier 
observations. 
 
• Do phytoplankton develop in (or get spread 
into) vertical layers in response to the shear at 
the base of the shallow pycnocline?  (This is 
relevant to a ‘patchy’ resource hypothesis.) 
• Is the structure of the spring mixed layer 
controlled by vertical processes?  To what 
extent are horizontal processes influencing the 
ecological interactions above the seasonal 
pycnocline? 
• Given that considerable horizontal mesoscale 
variability (passage of eddies – see Niiler and 
Paduan (1995); D’Asaro et al. (1995); Bograd 
et al. (1999)) has been observed in this region, 
to what extent is variability in horizontal 
advection influencing the vertical distribution 
patterns we observe?  
• Do the vertical gradients in plankton 
distribution (phytoplankton and zooplankton) 
match the vertical gradients in physical 
structure, including small-scale mixing?  It was 
suggested by Mackas et al. (1993) that the 
distinct differences in turbulence between the 
ecological intervals of the upper 100 m layer 
also influenced the distribution of the larger 
copepods.  
 
My research objectives in OECOS are to: 
 
• characterize the finescale (~1 m) vertical 
gradients in phytoplankton and zooplankton 
abundance (in response to the ‘patchy food’ 
hypothesis);  
• characterize the horizontal variability in 
physical properties and processes (temperature, 
salinity, and velocity);  
• simultaneously assess phytoplankton 
distributions (with bio-optics) and zooplankton 
distributions (with bio-acoustics) (also in 
response to the ‘patchy food’ hypothesis). 
 
Research approaches 
 
These objectives (and research questions) can be 
approached by using high-resolution profiles to 
address the vertical scales of variability, and 
mesoscale mapping surveys to address the 
horizontal scales of variability. 
 
Vertical processes and patterns 
 
My research group uses a free-profiling system 
that descends at ~0.20 m s
–1
 and resolves T, S, 
horizontal velocity, shear, chlorophyll 
fluorescence, spectral absorption and attenuation, 
and bio-acoustic backscatter (for small 
zooplankton).  T and S are resolved to 1 cm, while 
the bio-optical variables are resolved to  
3–5 cm.  Bio-acoustic backscatter is resolved in  
1 m depth bins.  Current velocity (horizontal) and 
vertical shear are resolved in 0.5 m depth bins.   
The profiler can also carry a small rosette system 
to collect discrete water samples during a profile, 
with depths of sample collection selected by the 
user watching the real-time output of the CTD 
system.  
 
Horizontal processes and patterns 
 
Regional/mesoscale variability in hydrography, 
phytoplankton, and acoustic proxies for 
zooplankton can be documented with mapping 
surveys using a towed, undulating SeaSoar vehicle 
(CTD and bio-optics) and a towed bio-acoustics 
array.  In conjunction with shipboard ADCP, such 
surveys can reveal the upper 200 m structure 
across a 150 km × 150 km region with a 5-day 
survey (non-stop) of 8 parallel lines, or across a 
100 km × 100 km region with a 3-day survey of 6 
lines, each assuming approximately 20-km spacing 
 
   
39
between each section (the local Rossby radius).  
This type of survey would provide 1 m vertical 
resolution of bio-acoustical backscattering – and 
would be a valuable complement to the stratified 
zooplankton tows that would be done by David 
Mackas and  Moira Galbraith. 
 
 
In order for the Eastern OECOS Group to incorporate a ~100 × 100 km SeaSoar grid in their work, it 
would take an additional ship (if 6-hourly station work is to be sustained at the time-series site).  Could 
SeaSoar work be accomplished by a separate, shorter visit of an intermediate-size vessel, e.g., R/V 
Wecoma?  That would probably take a justification based mostly on physics and separate from the main 
goals of OECOS.  Could it be part of a Canadian project, perhaps aboard the CCGS John P. Tully in an 
annual Line P transect?  Perhaps an autonomous vehicle could carry out such a survey and return to the 
main ship.  These devices are pretty close to ready for service. 
 
How much of what we need to know about shear can come from a shipboard acoustic Doppler current 
profiler (ADCP)?  How well can an ADCP be held in vertical ‘register’ with the water-column profiler 
results? 
 
Operation of the profiler will be weather-dependent, so we will not have profiles during storms (‘wind 
events’), but only during the intervals between them.  Some stratification may develop and have 
significant association with biological distributions as these intervals progress.  A reasonable guess is 
that thin layers are much more likely to be in the second layer, between the seasonal and permanent 
pycnoclines.  There is likely to be enough energy to keep the upper water column mixed with high 
frequency down to about 35 meters.   
 
Fine-scale profiles take time and require replication.  It will be useful, even at this early stage, to figure 
out a time budget and schedule for over-side work aboard the RV OECOS.

D. MICROZOOPLANKTON 
 
A key aspect of the food web in high-nitrate low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions, and in fact all oligotrophic 
oceans, is the complexity among autotrophs and heterotrophs at very small sizes.  Much of the production 
is from cyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes, and most of the rest from nanophytoplankton.  Grazing on the 
smallest primary producers begins with protozoans of only a few microns, and ciliates and heterotrophic 
dinoflagellates account for most of the rest of the first food chain transfer.  All of these small grazers are 
preyed upon by others of the same size or only slightly larger, so there is considerable trophic complexity 
before organic matter is transferred to mesozooplankton.  It is certain that most nutrition for 
mesozooplankton, particularly the copepods dominant in the spring transition, is not phytoplankton but 
microplankton, primarily protists.  Thus, to understand the control of phytoplankton stocks and 
production rates to evaluate food available to mesozooplankton, it is necessary to examine protistan 
ecology.  Two experts in this area, Drs. Suzanne Strom and Takashi Ota, discuss appropriate approaches 
in the following essays.  
 
 
Microzooplankton processes in oceanic waters of the eastern subarctic Pacific:  
Project OECOS

Microzooplankton (protozoan phagotrophs  
<200 µm) were first identified as significant 
consumers of phytoplankton in the eastern 
subarctic Pacific during research into the “Major 
Grazer Hypothesis” in 1984 (Miller, 1993b).  Low 
rates of phytoplankton removal by other processes 
(copepod grazing, sinking, and advection), 
coupled with growing recognition throughout the 
oceanographic community of the importance of 
microzooplankton (e.g., Azam et al., 1983), 
suggested that micrograzers must be responsible 
for the bulk of the herbivory in this high-nitrate, 
low-chlorophyll region.  Subsequent research 
during the Subarctic Pacific Ecosystem Research 
(SUPER) and Canadian Joint Global Ocean Flux 
Study (JGOFS) programs has borne out this 
prediction.  While one can quibble over the details 
(and the microzooplankton researchers certainly 
have), rates of microzooplankton grazing on 
phytoplankton, as measured by the seawater 
dilution technique, generally vary between about 
50 and 150% of phytoplankton intrinsic growth 
rates in this ecosystem.  Microzooplankton grazing 
in concert with iron limitation of phytoplankton 
growth rates is thought to be responsible for the 
high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll condition (i.e., the 
lack of phytoplankton blooms with attendant 
macronutrient depletion) in the oceanic waters of 
the eastern subarctic Pacific (Miller et al., 1991; 
Boyd et al., 2004).  We have recently found that 
this situation extends inshore as far as the outer 
continental shelf in the northern Gulf of Alaska 
(Strom et al., 2006). 
 
Features of this previous research relevant to 
OECOS include: 
 
• Every study so far (Strom and Welschmeyer, 
1991; Landry et al., 1993b; Rivkin et al., 1999; 
Liu et al., 2002) shows grazing : growth rate 
ratios ranging between about 0.5 and 1.5, with 
a few exceptionally low grazing rates in each 
data set.  Does this range represent ‘snapshots’ 
of different portions of the limit cycles 
experienced by the phytoplankton and 
(perhaps) their consumers? 
• Experiments conducted in winter (Boyd et al., 
1995b) gave rates similar to the lower end of 
the spring–summer range, and showed near 
equivalency between growth and grazing. 
• All rates measured to date, with the possible 
exception of those during the Subarctic Pacific

Iron Experiment for Ecosystem Dynamics 
Study (SERIES) (Boyd et al., 2004; specifics of 
SERIES grazing experiments are in press) have 
to be considered iron-contaminated.  
 
While the growth (i.e., cell division) rates of the 
ambient phytoplankton community probably do 
not respond measurably to Fe contamination or 
addition in 24 hours, it is unclear how 
physiological shifts might affect phytoplankton 
chlorophyll content, grazing pressures, and the 
grazing : growth relationship.  This needs to be 
investigated during OECOS by comparing ‘clean’ 
with ‘typical’ (of the past) incubations, and using 
physiological (e.g., F
v
/F
m
) and taxon-specific 
measures of phytoplankton processes. 
 
I envision two major areas of investigation for the 
microzooplankton component of the OECOS 
eastern program.  Below, I outline some of the 
compelling questions in each area, then describe 
the methods available to address these questions.  
The mix of approaches that we use will depend on 
the refinement of our hypotheses, and on 
methodological feasibility. 
 
Major Question I:  How do microzooplankton 
interact with their prey to maintain the observed 
upper and lower limits of phytoplankton biomass 
in the eastern subarctic Pacific? 
 
Historically, phytoplankton chlorophyll 
concentrations (Miller et al., 1991) and carbon 
biomass levels (Booth et al., 1993) have been 
observed to remain relatively constant year-round 
in this ecosystem.  However, within these narrow 
bounds, chlorophyll levels can vary on time scales 
suggestive of the ‘limit cycles’ produced by 
modeled predator–prey and limiting-nutrient 
interactions (Strom et al., 2000).  This 
observation, especially if characteristic of the 
ecosystem, leads to a series of questions about the 
workings of the lower trophic levels. 
 
1. Will we observe such cycles when we are again 
on station? 
 
We will have to obtain measurements daily for the 
component organisms and nutrients, and for 
processes hypothesized to be important in driving 
these cycles.  Finer temporal spacing of 
measurements could be nested in this daily 
sampling as personpower allows.  The key 
experimental design criterion will be the ability to 
make consistent, internally comparable measure-
ments over time. 
 
2. What keeps phytoplankton stocks from going 
any lower than they do (ca. 0.1 µg chl/l)? 
 
Candidate explanations put forward by Strom et 
al. (2000) include grazing thresholds and prey 
switching (e.g., among phytoplankton, to bacteria, 
or to other heterotrophic protists).  We can 
examine the first of these in two possible ways – 
first, by using a sequence of highly dilute 
treatments within seawater dilution experiments to 
look for a ‘leveling off’ of net growth rates, as 
would be expected if grazing ceases (reaches a 
threshold) at some low phytoplankton 
concentration.  Such an effect was hinted at in 
Sargasso Sea research (Lessard and Murrell, 
1998), although this involved a somewhat 
different treatment of the data.  With the exception 
of the Rivkin et al. (1999) study, which presents 
methological issues, the subarctic Pacific dilution 
experiment data summarized above only employed 
treatments at 25% full-strength seawater and 
above, with a limited number of total dilution 
levels, so they do not allow evaluation of the 
grazing threshold hypothesis.  We can also explore 
the use of variation in food vacuole contents as a 
measure of feeding intensity (Dolan and Simek, 
1998).  This will require some preliminary 
laboratory work. 
 
Prey switching can be examined by looking for 
temporal changes in the relative grazing intensity 
on different prey types.  Phytoplankton can be 
categorized by size class or taxon (e.g., using flow 
cytometry (Liu et al., 2002) or high-performance 
liquid chromatography (Strom and Welschmeyer, 
1991)).  Clearance rates on bacteria can be 
compared day-to-day by adding fluorescently 
labelled bacteria cells (Sherr et al., 1987) in tracer 
amounts to incubation experiments.  Assessing 
grazing by protists on heterotrophic protists is 
trickier.  We can try to examine this using size-
fractionation (or  ‘trophic cascade’) experiments 
(Calbet and Landry, 1999), but the amount of 
microscopy required to enumerate, say, 
heterotrophic flagellates in multiple treatments per 
 
   
43
experiment with any sort of time resolution 
(daily?) is daunting. 
 
3. What is the role of microzooplankton grazing in 
dictating iron availability (type and amount), and 
how does this influence the upper and lower 
biomass levels and growth rates of the 
phytoplankton? 
 
Perhaps some of the iron speciation measurements 
proposed by Chase and Cullen (this report) can be 
related to time series in microzooplankton 
abundance and activity.  Another idea is to use a 
backwards approach:  use a commercially 
available siderophore such as desferrioxamine 
(Wells, 1999) to soak up all (?) bioavailable iron, 
then see how much difference this makes in some 
fast-responding aspect of phytoplankton 
physiology such as F
v
/F
m
.  Presumably, if the 
phytoplankton are already strongly iron-limited, 
say at the peak in the cycle, the change in their 
physiological state would be slight, while the 
change would be larger if there were considerable 
available iron in the ecosystem.  Perhaps the cyclic 
changes will be obvious in a temporal series of 
F
v
/F
m
 and flavodoxin/ferridoxin without any fancy 
manipulations. 
 
Major Question II:  How do microzooplankton 
couple phytoplankton and copepod trophic 
levels? 
 
As already summarized by several previous essay 
writers, the interzonal migrators Neocalanus spp. 
(and likely the other dominant spring copepods 
Eucalanus bungii and Metridia pacifica) consume 
little phytoplankton production directly (Frost et 
al., 1983; Dagg, 1993a).  Rather, their diet consists 
largely of microzooplankton, with perhaps a 
substantial detrital component in some cases 
(Gifford and Dagg, 1991; Dagg, 1993b; Gifford, 
1993).  The larger microzooplankton (ciliates and 
heterotrophic dinoflagellates >30 µm) appear to be 
particularly important for Neocalanus, as indicated 
by recent experiments in the coastal Gulf of 
Alaska (Liu et al., 2005). 
1. To what extents do phytoplankton and 
microzooplankton size and species composition 
change as phytoplankton stock varies?  Does this 
affect trophic coupling to copepods? 
 
I am intrigued by the observation (Miller, 1993a) 
that individual Neocalanus flemingeri C5 biomass 
was considerably higher in 1988 than in 1987.  
Looking back at data for the lower trophic levels 
during those cruises, total (average) chlorophyll, 
autotrophic and heterotrophic carbon biomass 
were similar for the two spring periods (Booth et 
al., 1993), while primary productivity actually 
averaged somewhat lower in spring 1988 than in 
1987 (Welschmeyer et al., 1993).  Examining the 
size composition of the phyto- and 
microzooplankton (Fig. 18) indicates that larger 
auto- and heterotrophs were relatively more 
abundant in 1988.  The taxonomic composition 
(Fig. 19) shows that the spring of 1988 hosted a 
‘bloom’ of the diatom Nitzschia cylindroformis, 
which may, in turn, have supported the elevated 
1988 biomass of larger ciliates.  There may have 
been fewer trophic levels between the bulk of the 
phytoplankton and large copepods in 1988 
compared with 1987.  Analysis of size and 
taxonomic composition should indicate whether 
the trophic structure leading from phytoplankton 
to copepods changes as the lower trophic levels 
progress through limit cycles.  We can also use 
size fractionation experiments (e.g., Capriulo and 
Carpenter, 1980; Calbet and Landry, 1999) to 
investigate the number of trophic levels between 
various size classes of microzooplankton 
consumers and specific phytoplankton size classes, 
and taxa (e.g., Synechococcus spp. as enumerated 
with flow cytometry).  We have done these 
experiments with some success during U.S. Global 
Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC)-
sponsored research in the coastal Gulf of Alaska.  
Evaluations of size, taxonomic composition, and 
trophic relationships within the microplankton will 
also be an important point of comparison between 
eastern and western subarctic Pacific ecosystems 
(cf. Taniguchi, 1999).

2.  Are there significant ‘top-down’ effects of 
Neocalanus on phyto- and microzooplankton?   
 
In other words, does the grand pageant of 
interzonal migration, the spring surface layer 
phasing of growth and development of the 
different species, cascade down to the lower 
trophic levels? 
 
This could be an important link between the two 
geographic components of our program.  Landry et 
al. (1993a) explored the issue in two mesocosm 
experiments during SUPER, and found some 
increased cropping of diatoms and enhancement of 
bacterial production in the presence of 0.75 C5 N. 
plumchrus per liter.  Lower copepodid densities 
(but still several-fold higher than ambient) had 
little impact on lower trophic levels.  Additional 
evidence suggesting little top-down influence was 
the relatively low net production of ciliates in the 
absence of copepods – leaving little apparent 
ciliate production to be cropped by larger 
consumers (Landry et al., 1993a).  We observed 
similarly low net production of microzooplankton 
during incubations of seawater (with no meso- or 
macrozooplankton) in the coastal Gulf of Alaska 
during GLOBEC studies. 
 
On the other hand, microzooplankton biomass in 
the eastern subarctic Pacific appears to be 
relatively constant year-round, much like the 
observed pattern for chlorophyll.  Overall 
microzooplankton biomass levels at Ocean Station 
P in February 1994 and March 1993 (Boyd et al., 
1995a) were nearly identical to those observed 
during spring and summer in 1987 and 1988 
(Booth et al., 1993).  This directly contradicts the 
‘best fit’ (to empirical chlorophyll and nitrate data) 
nutrients – phytoplankton – zooplankton – detritus 
(NPZD) model of Frost (1993), which yields a 
roughly 4-fold range in microzooplankton biomass 
over the annual cycle.  The seasonal excursions 
predicted by Fasham (1995) and Denman and 
Peña (1999) in their NPZD models are even larger.  
If the large seasonal cycle in primary production 
moves up into the microzooplankton community 
but does not appear as accumulated biomass, 
where does it go?  Is it just ‘burned up’ by passing 
through multiple microzooplankton trophic levels?  
Do subarctic microzooplankton have extremely 
low gross growth efficiencies?  Given the paucity 
of data available so far, it will be extremely 
interesting just to observe the degree to which 
microzooplankton biomass increases in concert 
with spring primary production during the OECOS 
time series. 
 
In thinking about these issues I worry that we are 
missing an important planktonic group in our 
analyses – organisms between about 50–300 µm 
that occur at abundances of about 10–100 per liter.  
These would not be seen in ‘countable’ quantities 
in a settled 10–50 ml sample (as is usual for 
counting microzooplankton), and would tend to be 
undersampled and overlooked in net tow samples 
aimed at larger zooplankton.  You can see a list of 
such organisms at the bottom of Booth et al.’s 
(1993) Table 9; they include large ciliates, 
sarcodines, copepod nauplii, and could include 
larvaceans.  I can imagine sampling for, and 
enumerating, these – others (e.g., Gowing and 
Garrison, 1992) have used reverse concentration 
mechanisms to sample for the sarcodines – but 
how would we know what these organisms were 
doing in the environment (i.e., feeding rates, prey 
types)?  They might be quite important as prey for 
Neocalanus spp. 
 
A challenge will be dealing experimentally with 
trophic coupling between the large copepods and 
the microbial community. 
 
 
Dr. Strom suggests (and see Michael Dagg’s essay  in this report) that short-term cycling could reflect a 
top-down effect of mesozooplankton feeding on microheterotrophs (MH), although she then found no 
particular evidence for it in available data.  Testing this will take sophisticated evaluation of 
microherbivore stocks and feeding upon them, with particular attention to the 50–300 μm class of 
animals that she correctly notes gets too little attention.  There is also a whole level of zooplankton in the 
300–1000 μm class (Microcalanus, Oithona copepodites, and a considerable list of other forms) that can 
add steps to the food web.  These are very difficult to deal with technically, but perhaps they must be 
considered and their roles defined.

Functional role of microzooplankton in the pelagic marine ecosystem during 
phytoplankton blooms in the western subarctic Pacific

It has become obvious that microzooplanktonic 
assemblages perform multiple functions in marine 
ecosystems.  Namely, they are not only primary 
consumers of pico- and nano-sized producers but 
are also significant regenerators of nutrients.  In 
addition, they are important food sources for 
metazoan zooplankton and fish larvae. Which 
function is more important than the others depends 
on the food web structure of the ecosystem. 
 
How do microzooplankton function during the 
spring bloom in the Oyashio region? 
 
We have already learned several differences in 
ecological features between the western and 
eastern subarctic Pacific.  For example, strong 
spring blooms are regular annual events dominated 
by larger diatoms in the western subarctic Pacific 
(Kasai et al., 1997), while no pronounced spring 
phytoplankton bloom occurs in the eastern North 
Pacific (Miller, 1993a; Strom et al., 2000).  In the 
west, microzooplankton biomass is highest during 
or slightly after the diatom blooms, while there are 
no clear seasonal trends in the eastern subarctic 
Pacific.  Shinada et al. (2001) demonstrated that 
the microbial food chain largely channels carbon 
flow throughout the season, with the exception 
that the grazing food chain (phytoplankton eaten 
by copepods) is functional along with the 
microbial food chain only in the spring 
phytoplankton bloom period in the Oyashio 
region.  On the other hand, the grazing food chain 
is never significant in the eastern sector, and 
microzooplankton grazing is principally 
responsible for sustaining high-nitrate low-
chlorophyll (HNLC) conditions year-round (Strom 
et al., 2000).  From these comparisons, it is clear 
that the planktonic food chain structure in the 
Oyashio region differs from that in the eastern 
subarctic Pacific due to seasonal activation of the 
grazing food chain.  This implies that carbon 
transfer efficiencies from primary producers to 
mesozooplankton may be higher in the Oyashio 
region as compared to the eastern subarctic 
Pacific.  These conclusions, however, will need 
further verification because they were derived 
from monthly experiments.  
 
During the OECOS program, we propose to 
perform dilution experiments in conjunction with 
application of a size-fractionation method at least 
every 2–3 days to depict temporal changes in 
microzooplankton grazing rates and growth rates 
of phytoplankton.  In addition, we must conduct 
grazing experiments with copepods.  
 
How can we know the in situ metabolic activity 
of microzooplankton?  
 
The magnitude of microzooplankton activity can 
be evaluated from their productivity, standing 
stocks, and individual growth rates.  Cell cycle 
methods (McDuff and Chisholm, 1982) or the 
frequency of dividing cells (FDC) method are 
known to be among the best tools for estimating in 
situ growth rates of protists.  These methods have 
been successfully applied for several types of 
planktonic organisms, e.g., dinoflagellates (Weiler 
and Chisholm, 1976), Prochlorococcus (Vaulot et 
al., 1995) and Synechococcus (Campbell and 
Carpenter, 1986).  These methods were also 
applied to heterotrophic organisims such as 
tintinnid ciliates (Coats and Heinbokel, 1982) and 
oligotrichous ciliates (Ota, unpublished data; 
Growth rates of 16 natural populations of 12 
species were successfully estimated in subarctic 
waters.).  It has been well demonstrated that the 
growth rate of ciliates with plentiful food is a 
negative function of body size and a positive 
function of temperature.  Therefore, it is 
interesting to compare the in situ growth rates 
determined by the cell cycle method (µ
in situ
) with 
apparent growth rates estimated from incubation 
experiments, or maximum potential growth rates 
estimated from cell size and ambient temperature 
(e.g., Müller and Geller, 1993). Those 
 
   
47
comparisons will give information regarding the 
growth limitations affecting natural populations. In 
the OECOS program, therefore, we propose to 
conduct time-series sampling over 24 h  at least 
three times (early, mid-, end stages) throughout 
the bloom period to define in situ growth rates of 
dominant species of microzooplankton.  
 
Another expectation during the spring bloom in 
the western subarctic Pacific   
 
The western (at least east of 165°E) and eastern 
subarctic Pacific gyres are known to be HNLC 
regions, although the former area has greater 
aeolian dust flux, a major source of iron in the 
oceanic ecosystem.  In the western gyre we 
investigated the response of microzooplankton to 
the change in phytoplankton growth rate, species 
composition, and biomass during the 
phytoplankton bloom induced by an in situ iron 
fertilization study (SEEDS, Subarctic Pacific Iron 
Experiment and Ecosystem Dynamics Study).  
The results indicated the important role of 
heterotrophic dinoflagellate grazing in the food-
web dynamics and biogeochemical cycle of both 
the natural and iron-enriched situations (Saito et 
al., 2005). Briefly, the iron-enrichment experiment 
(SEEDS) induced a dramatic diatom bloom 
dominated by a chain-forming diatom from Day 9, 
after the addition, to the end of the experiment 
(Day 13).  In this period, there was also a massive 
occurrence of a heterotrophic dinoflagellate, 
Gyrodinium sp.  Mathematical simulations show 
Gyrodinium sp. would have almost grazed down 
the diatoms within 10–11 days after the bloom 
initiation and would have respired most of the 
carbon fixed by diatoms in the sea-surface.  This 
Gyrodinium sp. was originally a minor component 
of the microzooplankton assemblage, and was the 
only microheterotroph that could feed on the large, 
chain-forming diatoms that increased after the 
iron-enrichment.  Such emergences of minor 
species as principal players in SEEDS were not 
predicted prior to the experiment, due to our 
limited understanding of the species present and 
their physiological characteristics.  Although those 
results were derived from anthropogenic 
perturbations, similar events may occur during the 
natural ‘perturbations’ of the bloom period.  In 
order to understand the mechanisms of variations 
(or stabilities) of ecosystem and biogeochemical 
processes, we need further studies of food-web 
components and their functions, not only for 
dominant species but also for rare species.  
Especially, it should be worthwhile to focus on the 
dynamics and physiology of heterotrophic 
dinoflagellates, protozoans that can function as 
significant grazers during the spring bloom in the 
western subarctic Pacific. 
 
 
Evaluation of protistan growth rates from proportions of cells in different cell-cycle stages has been 
extremely laborious work.  Recurring application at high frequency in OECOS time-series studies will 
pose severe demands for data production.  Possibly this could be relieved by some of the video-
microscopy recording techniques proposed above by Drs. Selph and Furuya.  Species present in sufficient 
abundance could be stained, concentrated and presented to the recording system so as to make large 
numbers of cell-phase evaluations possible in near-real time.  Even for samples to be finally evaluated 
ashore, developmental work involving at least partial automation will be needed to raise the data volume 
to the levels needed for OECOS.  Nevertheless, this is a promising idea that can be evaluated thoroughly 
when Dr. Ota’s study of oligotrich growth rates becomes available.   
 
High-frequency dilution experiments also challenge our ability to generate data at high rates.  Probably 
each OECOS program should have a cooperative scheme for dilution experiments, so that they can 
provide data on production and grazing at the same time for all interested participants.  Perhaps  
14
C-uptake dilution studies (see Dr. Welschmeyer’s essay earlier in this report) can be designed to 
produce all possible outputs from a single incubation series.  It is possible that the 2-point experiments 
proposed recently by Michael Landry (ASLO meeting, 2005, Santiago de Compostela) can be evaluated 
quickly enough to provide times series of phytoplankton growth and loss to micrograzers.  Maybe dilution 
experiments can be evaluated by flow cytometry to break out separate rates ( μ and g) for different classes 
of phytoplankton.

E. MESOZOOPLANKTON 
 
The OECOS idea, a comparative study between eastern and western subarctic ecosystems, arose in a 
discussion between Drs. Tsutomu Ikeda and Charles Miller about data requirements for evaluating 
development of the copepods termed (by Vinogradov (1968)) interzonal migrators (IZM), species that 
strongly dominate the net-caught zooplankton during the spring transition all across the subarctic 
Pacific.  These species have 1- or 2-year life cycles, in all cases with prolonged resting stages at depth.  
Essays provided for the OECOS meeting cover many aspects of the life history, vertical distribution, and 
ecological roles of these species.  One principal goal of an OECOS program will be to obtain growth 
evaluations for IZM copepods in order to compare a strongly food-limited habitat expected in the eastern 
gyre with a more food-replete habitat during a spring bloom in the west.  We need to evaluate 
development rates and growth using similar methods, and we need to compare feeding rates and food 
selection.  We know that these copepods feed on large phytoplankton when it is abundant in coastal 
zones, and that they have much faster development than those in continuously high-nitrate low-
chlorophyll (HNLC) conditions at Ocean Station P.  We expect to see this difference in our comparison 
and to evaluate it quantitatively. 
 
The meeting included six students of mesozooplankton: Michael Dagg, Moira Galbraith (Monday only, 
representing herself and David Mackas), Tsutomu Ikeda, Toru Kobari, Charles Miller, and Atsushi 
Yamaguchi.  All of their essays are presented serially here, without further comment.

In the spring season (roughly March to May or 
June) the upper 100 m of the subarctic Pacific is 
occupied by, and feeds, a very high biomass of 
large ‘interzonal migrant’ copepods.  Research at 
Station P during the weathership era (Frost, 1983; 
Fulton, 1983; Miller et al., 1984b, 1988, and 
others) documented the major seasonal features of 
life history and deep dormancy. Subsequent 
research during the Subarctic Pacific Ecosystem 
Research (SUPER), Joint Global Ocean Flux 
Study (JGOFS) and Surface Ocean Low 
Atmosphere Study/Subarctic Pacific Iron 
Experiment for Ecosystem Dynamics Study 
(SOLAS/SERIES) programs (Landry and Lehner-
Fournier, 1988; Dagg, 1993a; Gifford, 1993; 
Goldblatt et al., 1999, and others) showed that the 
copepods do not directly regulate the bulk of 
phytoplankton production, but instead get most of 
their diet from protist microzooplankton, and from 
the relatively sparse and temporally intermittent 
population of large phytoplankton.  
 
The focus for our previous work during SUPER 
(Mackas et al., 1993), and one focus for our 
proposed OECOS work, is on the layered vertical 
distribution of these copepods within the upper 
100–150 m.  This vertical zonation (which was 
confirmed in Canadian JGOFS studies, Goldblatt 
et al., 1999) is persistent throughout the day–night 
cycle and strongly affects where rates of feeding 
activity (and mortality of microplankton) are 
highest.  Neocalanus plumchrus and N. flemingeri 
occupy the surface mixed layer; N. cristatus and  
E. bungii are usually, but not always, concentrated 
below the mixed layer.  Centers of vertical 
distributions of all four species become deeper 
when wind is strong and upper-layer density 
stratification is weak, suggesting that turbulence 
intensity may be one of the environmental cues 
affecting their depth preferences. Subsequent 
 
   
50
observations during Canadian JGOFS (Goldblatt 
et al., 1999) and SOLAS/SERIES (Tsuda et al., in 
press) support the general pattern of vertical 
partitioning of the upper 100 m, but Tsuda et al. 
added the important new observation that  
N. cristatus moved upward into the surface mixed 
layer during (and within) a localized summer 
season diatom bloom induced by iron enrichment.  
 
The field sampling and lab identifications required 
to describe upper layer vertical distributions are 
laborious but relatively straightforward:  stratified 
oblique tows within the upper 250 m, using a 
multiple net sampler such as MOCNESS or 
BIONESS, followed by microscopic identification 
and counting to species and developmental stage. 
Sampling intervals should be approximately every 
second day, with some added day–night 
comparisons.  
 
Our second research interest within OECOS is 
seasonal developmental timing of the copepods, 
and the cause(s) for relative brevity of the surface 
layer biomass maximum and the later stages of the 
annual N. plumchrus cohort.  In the 1990s, we 
began to realize that the timing of the biomass 
maximum and of the onset of seasonal dormancy 
for N. plumchrus varies on decadal time scales by 
nearly 2 months, and that differences in timing are 
very well-correlated with interannual and 
latitudinal variability in surface warming and 
stratification (Mackas et al., 1998; Bertram et al., 
2001; Batten et al., 2003; Mackas and Batten, 
2005).  Evidence to date is that control of this 
timing takes place in the upper layer during the 
spring growing season, and not as a consequence 
of changing date of emergence from dormancy 
and spawning.  In the open Pacific, the duration of 
the deep spawning by N. plumchrus is very long 
(Miller and Clemons, 1988) and, in particular, is 
much longer than the biomass peak produced by 
the main pulse of C4 and C5 pre-dormant 
copepodites.  In contrast to the strong correlation 
with mixed-layer temperature anomalies, there is 
no correlation of interannual timing variability 
with temperature anomalies at the dormancy depth 
(Mackas et al., 1998).  As yet, we do not know 
how a very broad cohort of eggs becomes a much 
narrower cohort of late copepodites.  Candidates 
include:  
 
• a progressive temperature-driven acceleration 
of development (likely to occur, but probably 
not large enough to account for the observed 
range of variation),  
• stalling of development, and accumulation of 
hatched juveniles at some relatively early life 
stage until food and temperature environments 
allow further progression (Saito and Tsuda 
(2000) saw hints of this at the late naupliar 
stage in laboratory rearing experiments),  
• and/or temperature-correlated variations in 
survivorship that preferentially eliminate a 
large subset of the annual cohort of nauplii and 
early-stage copepodites.  
  
This question can be addressed using the same 
samples and numerical data that Charles Miller 
will be using to generate ‘Heinle graphs’ and 
growth rate estimates (later in this report).

Interannual variations in developmental timing of 
dominant calanoid copepods have been evaluated 
at Site H, in the Oyashio region, based on time-
series sampling conducted in 1996–1997 and 
2002–2004.  The major results of this study are 
that:  
 
1. Both temperature and chlorophyll a varied 
interannualy, but no effects on reproduction 
timing or generation length were seen for 
copepods with annual life cycles;  
  
2. Abundances of Neocalanus plumchrus and 
Eucalanus bungii were correlated with the 
magnitude of the spring phytoplankton bloom.  
This suggests that food supply is an important 
factor affecting their population sizes;    
 
3.  Salp blooms in 2003 affected the recruitment of 
N. plumchrus and E. bungii but not recruitment 
of other copepods, suggesting possible food 
competition between young copepodids of the 
two species and salps;  
 
4. Interannual variations in the recruitment season 
of Metridia pacifica may be interpreted by the 
shorter generation length, lack of a diapause 
phase, and close coupling of feeding and 
spawning of this species as compared with the 
other copepods.  
For details, see Figure 20.   
 
All previous sampling programs were based 
typically on only one sampling per month.  This 
sampling interval is too coarse to analyze the rapid 
development sequence of important copepods 
during the season of the phytoplankton bloom.  
High-frequency sampling in the OECOS program 
will reveal several aspects currently not known in 
the Oyashio ecosystem: 
  
1. Accurate growth rate estimates of four 
diapausing copepods (three Neocalanus species 
and E. bungii);  
 
2. Grazing impacts of Neocalanus spp. and E. 
bungii on the spring phytoplankton bloom; 
 
3. Spatial (vertical) and temporal niche 
separation, if any, of several zooplankton 
species; 
 
4. Egg production monitoring for some 
zooplankton (e.g., M. pacifica, E. bungii) 
through the phytoplankton bloom.

Fig. 20 Coupled tables showing the timing of recruitment of early copepodid stages for each copepod species.   
The left column is year, number of generations per year and presence of diapause phase in their life cycle.  The 
underlined months indicate the year when the maximum abundance was seen.  The lower table shows environmental 
conditions in each year:  temperature, chlorophyll a, and other factors.  The presence of a warm core ring in June 
2003 induced a large Salpida bloom, which apparently resulted in low abundance of Eucalanus bungii and 
Neocalanus plumchrus.  From chlorophyll a, a spring bloom of large magnitude in 1997 parallels high abundance of 
E. bungii and N. plumchrus in that year.  Among the five copepod species studied, only Metridia pacifica had 
multiple generations per year, and no diapause phase in their life cycle.  Metridia pacifica showed greater variations 
in timing of recruitment of early copepodid stages.  Thus, the habitat-responsive reproductive strategy of this species 
allows it to initiate spawning more flexibly than the other species.

OECOS: Proposed mesozooplankton research in the Oyashio region, western 
subarctic Pacific

Background 
 
Life cycles of large- and medium-sized, grazing 
copepods (Neocalanus cristatus, N. plumchrus,  
N. flemingeri, Eucalanus bungii, and Metridia 
pacifica) have been studied extensively at Station 
P in the eastern subarctic Pacific by U.S. and 
Canadian scientists during the 1980s.  In the 
western subarctic Pacific, Japanese scientists have 
pursued intensive studies on life cycles of 
dominant mesozooplankton in the Oyashio region 
since 1995.  The time series of mesozooplankton 
data at Site H in the Oyashio region were 
developed by sampling at monthly intervals over 
one full year using vertical hauls with closing nets 
at 5 discrete depths between the surface and 2000 
m.  Whenever possible, some short-term reference 
stations were set in the central and eastern 
subarctic Pacific, Bering Sea, Okhotsk Sea, and 
Japan Sea during the program, and compared with 
the results at Site H.  
 
As a result, information about life cycles 
(spawning season, development pattern, 
generation time, longevity, etc.) has accumulated 
rapidly on a number of zooplankton species in the 
Oyashio region, including copepods (N. cristatus, 
N. plumchrus, N. flemingeri, Eucalanus bungii,  
M. pacifica, M. okhotensis, Paraeuchaeta 
elongata, Heterorhabdus tanneri, Pleuromamma 
scutullata, Gaidius variabilis, Pseudocalanus 
minutus, P. newmani, Oncaea spp., and Triconia 
spp.), a euphausiid (Euphausia pacifica), 
amphipods (Themisto japonica, T. pacifica, 
Primno abyssalis, and Cyphocaris challengeri), an 
ostracod (Discoconchoecia pseudodiscophora), a 
hydromedusa (Aglantha degitale), and 
chaetognaths (Sagitta elegans and Eukrohnia 
hamata).  Most of these results have been 
published (see bibliography at the end of this 
essay).  For the large- to medium-sized grazing 
copepods mentioned above, the differences in the 
life cycles of Neocalanus spp. between Site H and 
Station P are not appreciable.  As exceptions,  
E. bungii had a 1-year life cycle, in contrast to 
their 2-year life cycle at Station P, and M. pacifica 
completed 2 generations at Site H in contrast to 3 
generations at Station P.  Some details of these 
results were presented by Drs. Toru Kobari and 
Atsushi Yamaguchi at the OECOS Workshop.   
 
A common phenomenon among these copepods 
was that the body size of specimens at Site H was 
much larger than that at Station P.  This regional 
difference in body size leads us to examine the 
possible existence of regional populations of  
N. cristatus, which is the most important 
mesozooplankton species in terms of biomass in 
the Oyashio region (see below).  Nucleotide 
sequence data of mitochondrial 16S rRNA and 
COI genes of N. cristatus collected from various 
regions within the subarctic Pacific and its 
marginal seas revealed no such distinctive 
subpopulations for this species.  Thus, regional 
variations in body size of N. cristatus can be 
ascribed to environmental conditions (temperature, 
food abundance, etc.) that vary from one region to 
the next.  In this regard, Site H is colder, yet has a 
much more abundant food supply (incidence of 
massive phytoplankton blooms in spring) 
compared with the conditions at Station P (warmer 
temperature, and no incidence of phytoplankton 
blooms).  Euphausia pacifica exhibits a marked 
regional variation in life cycle patterns in the 
subarctic Pacific and its marginal seas, but our 
current mitochondrial 16S rRNA data also showed 
no genetic distinctions among specimens from 
distant locations. 
 
Through the analyses of life cycles of various 
mesozooplankton mentioned above, the 
contribution of the population biomass of each 
species or group to the total mesozooplankton 
biomass becomes evident.  Of the total biomass 
 
   
54
(16 g DW m
–2
, at 0–2000 m, annual mean), the 
most important species is N. cristatus at 31%, 
followed by N. plumchrus (15%), E. bungii (13%), 
N. flemingeri (6%) and M. pacifica (6%).  These 
large- to medium-sized grazing copepods 
altogether contribute 40% of the total 
mesozooplankton biomass at Site H. 
 
OECOS: The new phase of research in the 
Oyashio region 
 
Low-frequency sampling (e.g., 1 sample per 
month), mentioned above, was enough to let us 
gain information about the overall picture of 
mesozooplankton life cycles for species with a 
generation length of 1 year or more.  However, 
precise calculation of population production of 
these mesozooplankton requires high resolution 
data on their developmental sequences.  For 
example, all large- to medium-sized grazing 
copepods achieved rapid development from early 
to late copepodite stages through phytoplankton 
blooms which lasted ca. 3 months (April–June).  
As seen in our low-frequency sampling, 
abundance peaks of 3 to 4 copepodite stages 
occurred simultaneously, in the sample of the 
same month, making it difficult to estimate 
development time of each stage.  High-frequency 
sampling (1 sample per day) during OECOS 
should solve that problem.   
 
Population production calculations for oceanic 
zooplankton have been regarded as difficult, 
largely due to problems in estimating mortality 
rates by repeated samplings on the same 
populations over the time.  This is partly because 
populations do not remain in place for sampling.  
Clearly, mortality is a central issue for a 
zooplankton production study in OECOS, 
especially for the design of the high-frequency 
sampling program.  On the other hand, a simple 
‘growth-rate method’, ignoring mortality, may be 
applicable: 
   
Production Rate = individual growth rate (for 
suitable categories × their biomass). 
 
A thought about high-frequency sampling in 
the Oyashio region 
 
Two sampling methods may be considered:  (1) at 
fixed locations (possibly two, to examine the 
effect of small-scale patchiness), and (2) by 
following buoys with drogues (whether at one 
location or several locations across the stream axis 
is open to discussion). For (1), it is assumed that 
the population of a given mesozooplankton species 
in the Oyashio region is homogenous upstream 
from the station, with life cycles synchronized 
throughout.  For (2), the starting position needs to 
take into account the Russian Exclusive Economic 
Zone (EEZ) (likely not accessible) and the 
complex flow field of the Oyashio region.  The 
main stream of the Oyashio flows at a speed of 
20–30 cm s
–1
, which may drift the buoy eastward 
from the region in a few weeks, toward offshore 
waters characterized by HNLC conditions.

Some background on Neocalanus feeding

In the southeast Bering Sea, a region of high 
phytoplankton stocks during the spring bloom and 
low concentration during post-bloom periods, 
experiments (Dagg and Wyman, 1983) indicated 
high feeding rates on phytoplankton (based on gut 
pigments) in the spring and much lower rates in 
the post-bloom summer period (Table 2).  
Neocalanus cristatus rates were much higher than 
those of N. plumchrus (likely to be a mixture of  
N. plumchrus and N. flemingeri which were not 
separated at that time). 
 
In bottle incubation experiments (Dagg et al., 
1982; done at copepod concentrations that I now 
realize were much too high, so rates are 
underestimates) using a particle counter, and 
pooling data from N. cristatus CV (Stage V) and 
CIV and N. plumchrus CV, ingestion at high food 
concentrations (> 400 μg C l
–1
) was variable, but 
the average was 26.5 μg C cop
–1
 d
–1
.  At lower 
food concentrations, ingestion was linearly related 
to food concentration, decreasing as food 
concentrations decreased.  
 
In lab experiments (Dagg and Walser, 1986) with 
N. plumchrus, CV feeding on Thalassiosira 
weissflogii gut pigment content was high but 
variable at chlorophyll concentrations > 3 μg l
–1
 
and decreased towards zero at lower chlorophyll 
concentrations.  Lowest gut pigment levels were 
1–2 ng cop
–1
 and high levels averaged about 26 ng 
cop
–1
.  
During extensive experimentation in SUPER 
(Subarctic Pacific Ecosystem Research) (Dagg, 
1993a,b; at Ocean Station P (OSP)), two 
approaches for measuring feeding rates on 
phytoplankton by all three Neocalanus species 
were used:  the gut pigment method, and a bottle 
incubation method using chlorophyll 
disappearance during incubation as the index of 
feeding.  Both methods gave similar rates for  
N. plumchrus CV and N. flemingeri CV of 
between about 20 and 80 ng chl cop
–1
 d
–1
.  (I also 
have some data for CIV and CIII).  These are low 
ingestion rates of phytoplankton, equivalent to 
only a few μg C cop
–1
 d
–1
.  Adding the ingestion of 
microzooplankton (measured by Gifford (1993)) 
approximately doubles the total ingestion rate. 
Comparison with calculated ingestion rate 
demands (based on body size–respiration 
relationships) suggests these copepods are barely 
able to grow in the eastern subarctic Pacific 
(although they do grow (Miller and Nielsen, 1988; 
Miller, 1993a)).  This suggests we are missing 
something:  for example, alternative sources of 
food, or patchiness that can lead to small-scale, 
high-rate feeding events.  On the other hand, these 
rates are quite consistent with expected feeding 
behavior of these copepods in high-nitrate low-
chlorophyll (HNLC), nano-dominated food 
environments like the eastern subarctic Pacific. 
These copepods are feeding at rates very much 
below saturation.  Supportive data comes from a 
comparison of N. plumchrus (including

N. flemingeri) body size and growth rate at OSP 
with rates from the southeast Bering Sea (Vidal 
and Smith, 1986; Dagg, 1991).  These indicate 
slower growth at OSP where development is 
slower and final body size is smaller, suggesting 
much reduced ingestion.  There remain 
inconsistencies, however, between estimates of 
food required for observed growth, and measured 
rates of ingestion. That is, the question, “How do 
they make it?” remains unanswered. 
 
Neocalanus cristatus CV feeding was different 
from the other two Neocalanus species. Gut 
pigment contents were higher, between about 3 
and 33 ng cop
–1
, with a slight diel cycling between 
a minimum in the afternoon and a maximum in 
early morning (0200–0400 h).  By comparison, gut 
pigment levels in N. plumchrus and N. flemingeri 
CV were typically between 0.5 and 4.0 ng cop
–1
. 
In addition, for N. cristatus CV, the two methods 
for measuring phytoplankton ingestion gave 
different results, with the incubation method 
indicating approximately 90 ng cop
–1
 d
–1
 and the 
gut pigment method indicating approximately 355 
ng cop
–1
 d
–1
.  This latter observation, plus other 
information (depth distribution, microscopic 
examination of gut contents, in-water body 
orientation, and behavior), led me to conclude that 
N. cristatus CV feeds on sinking aggregates 
(Dagg, 1993a).  
 
More recent work in the Global Ocean Ecosystem 
Dynamics (GLOBEC) program from the Gulf of 
Alaska shelf (Dagg et al., 2005) has shown that 
fifth copepodites of N. plumchrus and N. 
flemingeri do not appear to feed any differently 
from each other when given the same foods 
(although I am still analyzing some experiments 
microscopically). However, because they are 
separated temporally, they do not always live in 
identical food environments.  Both feed at high 
rates under high phytoplankton concentrations, but 
rates are variable.  Both clearly prefer large 
particles (> 20 μm), sometimes consume 
intermediate sized particles (5–20 μm), and rarely 
consume any small particles (< 5 μm), whether the 
food environment is dominated by large particles 
or small ones (Figs. 21 and 22).  Micro- 
zooplankton in their diets are being analyzed now.  
 
One interesting observation in these cruises was 
that, although the daily ingestion of both copepods 
varied widely because of variability in 
phytoplankton availability, these daily differences 
did not result in differences in the final body size 
or lipid store (Fig. 23).  These copepods efficiently 
integrate small and mesoscale variation in their 
food environment over their 60- to 90-day growth 
period on the shelf and all end up about the same.  
(The inner shelf waters of the Gulf of Alaska 
commonly contain high concentrations of large 
phytoplankton; the middle shelf and the outer shelf 
usually have low concentrations of phytoplankton 
dominated by small cells). 
 
As in other studies, N. cristatus CV on the shelf in 
the Gulf of Alaska is different from the other two 
Neocalanus species (Liu et al., 2005).  In common 
however, is the preference for large particles, 
although this is even more pronounced with  
N. cristatus.  Consumption of large (30–70 μm) 
microzooplankton by N. cristatus, combined with 
their inability to feed on small particles, resulted in 
a strong cascade effect in bottle incubations, in 
which abundance of small particles increased 
dramatically because N. cristatus consumed the 
predators of those cells.  Calculations indicated 
this effect would also occur in nature under some 
conditions.  
 
Under non-bloom conditions, 73% of the carbon 
ingested by N. cristatus CV was from heterotrophs 
and 27% from autotrophs.  Under bloom 
conditions, heterotrophs were less important, 
contributing only 37% vs. 63% by autotrophs 
(Fig. 24). 
 
Each N. cristatus CV consumed approximately 
two times more C d

 under bloom conditions 
(average = 21.4 μg C cop
–1
 d
–1
) than under non-
bloom conditions (average = 10.0 μg C cop
–1
 d
–1
), 
but neither rate was adequate to meet nutritional 
demands for growth and metabolism.  We have 
concluded that these rates, derived from bottle 
incubations, are underestimates of in situ rates 
because (a) consumption of large particles is 
underestimated; (b) some very large particles are 
not accounted for at all in bottle experiments; and 
(c) aggregates are not accounted for in bottle 
experiments.  The feeding behavior of N. cristatus, 
one of the most abundant copepods in the North 
Pacific Ocean, remains incompletely understood.

Possible contributions to OECOS  
 
I am interested in (a) the feeding behavior of the 
above copepods, especially N. cristatus, and  
(b) the mechanisms and pathways by which the 
feeding activity of Neocalanus spp. structure the 
food web.  
 
Some initial thoughts 
 
• We do not need more bottle experiments – 
unless in very large (5–10 l) bottles.   
• More mesocosm experiments might be useful 
to elucidate their roles in the system. 
• There is a need for methods to examine 
copepod feeding on large particles, including 
aggregates. 
• We need ways to examine the significance of 
patchiness-induced feeding events on small T 
and S scales (microstructure).   
• We need to examine gut contents more 
carefully to get ideas of what they are eating, 
and apply gut clearance rates to get ingestion 
rates.  
 
Alternatively we might want to completely ignore 
feeding and focus on the end result – i.e., growth 
and development.  However, a close comparison 
of growth and feeding would be useful.

Dominant subarctic copepods 
 
Western and eastern sectors of the subarctic 
Pacific have the same set of dominant particle-
feeding copepods.  During the spring transition, 
the period of thermal stratification, these are: 
Neocalanus plumchrus, Neocalanus flemingeri, 
Neocalanus cristatus, Eucalanus bungii and 
Metridia pacifica.  Neocalanus spp. all reproduce 
at great depth (>500 m), entirely from stored 
nutriment, producing lipid-rich nauplii (Saito and 
Tsuda, 2000) that swim (and rise) to upper ocean 
layers for feeding as copepodites.  In the Gulf of 
Alaska, the first two species listed have their main 
copepodite development in the near-surface layer, 
above the initially weak thermocline, with  
N. flemingeri development preceding that of  
N. plumchrus by three to four stages, to nearly a 
month.  Development of N. cristatus and E. bungii 
is more spread out in time, with copepodites of the 
former being present over a longer season, and 
growth of the latter possibly occurring over more 
than 1 year.  At least in the Gulf of Alaska the 
cristatus–bungii pair lives below the plumchrus–
flemingeri pair (Mackas et al., 1993; Goldblatt et 
al., 1999).  Possibly the nutrition of the deeper pair 
is partly fecal matter from the near-surface pair 
(Dagg, 1993b).  OECOS time-series observations 
in the spring transition period will provide an 
extended re-evaluation of these relationships in 
vertical distribution, trophic interaction and 
development timing in the Gulf of Alaska.  More 
important time-series data from a site in the 
western subarctic gyre, where there is a very 
strong spring bloom, will allow us to compare the 
relationships under very different feeding 
conditions. 
 
All of the Neocalanus species have 1-year life 
cycles, and they tend to develop as single cohorts 
with distinct, slow, stage progressions that are 
evident in sampling with high temporal resolution.  
This feature means that high resolution time series 
that are long enough in both the eastern and 
western sectors should allow comparison of 
development and growth in the field under 
contrasting nutritional conditions.  Several shorter 
development studies of the sort proposed here 
have already been done in the eastern sector 
(Miller and Nielsen, 1988; Miller, 1993a).  
Changing stage proportions have been used to 
estimate the development rates of N. flemingeri 
and N. plumchrus through a few stages each.  
Rates for the latter species were slow relative to 
those observed in much more eutrophic, enclosed 
coastal waters, particularly the Strait of Georgia, 
between Vancouver Island and the British 
Columbia mainland (Evanson et al., 2000; 
Campbell, 2003).  Those coastal studies with 
resolution of a few weeks were not sufficiently 
refined to follow cohort development or define 
stage duration.  All stages tended to peak on the 
same sampling date, a problem identical to that 
experienced with all sampling to date in the 
western oceanic sector (e.g., Tsuda et al., 1999; 
Kobari and Ikeda, 2001a,b; Shoden et al., 2005).  
Sufficiently prolonged and highly resolved 
sampling will catch the developmental 
progressions in both spring bloom (western) and 
continuously high-nitrate low-chlorophyll (HNLC) 
(eastern) conditions. 
 
Development rates 
 
The requirement for development rate 
determinations is daily (better twice daily) 
samples, say 100–0 m, with nets large enough to 
catch a few thousand of the dominant copepodite 
species.  These will then be counted by stage, with 
stage duration estimated by the ‘Heinle graph’ 
technique (Fig. 25, Miller, 1993a).  This method is 
subject to some bias because changes in stage 
proportions due to stage-to-stage differentials in 
mortality are not separated from changes due to 
development (modeled by Miller, 1993a; Miller 
and Tande, 1993).  These mortality biases, shown 
by the models to be modest (~2 days in 13, 
depending upon stage-to-stage differentials in 
 
   
63
mortality rate), cannot be overcome.  However, it 
is almost certain that the western development 
times will be enough shorter than those in the east, 
and that the comparison will be clear and 
approximately quantitative. 
 
There are also measures of stage duration based on 
incubation techniques.  The idea is that a stage is 
sorted out, incubated (usually with natural food 
levels), and the molting rate is followed 
(Kimmerer, 1983; Miller et al., 1984a).  Under 
certain assumptions, the inverse of the fractional 
molting rate is the stage duration.  The key 
assumption is that the population is in steady state, 
with all ages-within-stage equally represented.  
Such methods do not work particularly well in the 
singe-cohort situation of the subarctic Pacific 
(Miller and Nielsen, 1988).  Suppose that work 
begins when the cohort of N. flemingeri is entering 
predominantly the third copepodite stage (C3).  
The stage is going to last up to 2 weeks, so 
experiments established over the first few days 
show no molting whatsoever.  Eventually, molting 
rates pick up and rise to a high level when all the 
remaining C3 are at older ages-within-stage.  None 
of the proportions are particularly well represented 
by the small samples that are possible to sort.  
Feeding conditions are impossible to maintain at 
near-natural levels over days and days.  Extended 
work in refrigerated labs on board is required to 
obtain nearly worthless results.  There are 
techniques for the screening of samples to remove 
stages larger and smaller than a mid-range 
selection, say C2, C3, and C4, which is then 
checked after an interval for change in mean stage 
(so-called artificial cohorts: Kimmerer and 
McKinnon, 1987; Hopcroft et al., 1998; Campbell 
et al., 2001).  This apparently works reasonably 
well in the tropics for small, very fast developing 
species, but in the subarctic situation it has all the 
same problems as single-stage sorting.  Screening 
damages individuals.  Earliest stages are likely to 
be molting very fast, and the next ones not at all, 
introducing unacceptable biases.  Also, food 
conditions cannot be sustained at normal levels 
long enough to generate meaningful data.  The 
best route will be to follow cohort development in 
the water column.

median crossings of the C2–C3 transition and the C3–C4 transition is an estimate of typical stage duration for the 
main annual cohort, 13 days in 1984.  These have been termed (by this author) ‘Heinle graphs’ after Donald Heinle, 
who used them to evaluate growth in laboratory rearings. 
 
   
64
Individual biomass – What we need to measure 
 
Stage duration is a measure of the time aspect 
(denominator) of a growth rate determination.  We 
also must know how much growth occurs, and this 
estimate is more difficult to obtain.  We need to 
know the increment in organic content (dry mass 
or carbon mass) that occurs during the stage:  
W
end
–W
start
.  It is generally not possible to look at a 
specimen to determine its age-within-stage, thus, 
development-specific weights are not readily 
attained.  Workers often overcome this by 
measuring mean weights for successive stages, 
then using the change in those means between 
stages as a measure of growth.  Since stages of 
large, subarctic copepods are engaged in rather 
different phases of growth, including massive lipid 
accumulation to support diapause and all 
reproduction, it would be informative to do better 
than that.   
 
At least with live Neocalanus it is possible to 
distinguish individuals about to molt.  They have 
double exoskeletons and thus, possess doubly 
intense apparent pigmentation.  Setae developed 
for the new exoskeleton within the tissues give the 
caudal furcae and limbs a distinctive striated 
appearance.  These individuals can be sorted and 
their mass determined to mark the terminal mass 
for their stages.  Exoskeleton mass can be 
determined for exuviae (at least approximately) 
and subtracted from terminal mass.  That should 
be an estimate of the initial mass of the next stage.  
This should be quite accurate, since very little 
growth occurs in the last phase of each stage.   
 
Another approach is to measure the variability of 
individual mass throughout the development of a 
cohort (at least the part for which a ship is on 
station).  When the oldest cohort members reach, 
say, C3, all of them will be young-within-stage.  
Their mass will approximate the initial mass (with 
associated individual variability).  When the oldest 
C3 are nearing molt and the youngest C3 are 
newly molted, the full range of mass should be 
represented, and the bulk should be at about mid-
stage mass.  This should allow good modeling of 
individual growth within the stage.  If all measures 
of mass are for individuals for which length is also 
measured, the effect of body size variation on 
mass increase over the stage can be accounted for.  
It will explain (in the statistical sense) much of the 
individual variability.  Copepods do vary 
dramatically in body length within each stage 
(e.g., Miller, 1993a; Miller et al., 2000).   
 
In order to make these measurements fully 
meaningful, we need a correct model of copepod 
growth, particularly the pattern of growth within 
the molt cycle.  This has never been demonstrated 
for copepods, probably because it is so difficult to 
obtain individual copepods of known age-within-
stage.  No work comparable to that with crab 
larvae (Anger, 2001; Steve Sulkin, Shannon Point 
Marine Laboratory) has been done for copepods.  
However, there are observations suggesting that 
the Anger–Sulkin model of the interaction of 
growth and development in decapod larvae does 
apply to copepods.  This has three parts:  the time-
course of mass increase through the phases of the 
molt cycle, and two effects of food rations on 
growth and molting.  Growth follows a pattern 
(Fig. 26) like that of the zoea I of Hyas araneus (a 
spider crab whose very numerous eggs all hatch in 
synchrony, then sustain it well enough so that 
many individuals are available for weighing, etc. 
at each age-within-stage).  Growth is very rapid at 
first with ~70% of the total stage increment laid up 
in the first half of the molt cycle.  Then growth 
slows as morphogenesis, in preparation for the 
next molt, takes more of the ingested nutrition.  
Actually, ingestion and assimilation also slow, 
with the last fraction of the cycle showing no 
growth at all. 
 
The molt cycle divides into phases with respect to 
the effect of withdrawal of food.  If food is 
withdrawn before 30% of the molt-to-molt period 
passes, growth stops, eventually a very quiescent 
phase is reached, and molting does not occur.  
Withdrawal of food shortly after 30% (this is 
variable among species, of course) stops growth (it 
must), but it does not stop or delay the next molt, 
to which the animal is hormonally committed.  
The next instar just comes out smaller.  This time 
of commitment to the next molt is termed the 
‘Point of Reserve Saturation’ (PRS).  Larvae that 
are starved after PRS, and then have molted, 
require considerably longer to complete their next 
stage; there is a recovery period in which 
nutritional status is restored, and only after which 
growth and development can resume.  There is 
 
   
65
also an effect of starvation starting from the 
beginning of a stage (or before PRS), termed the 
‘Point of no Return’ (PNR).  This is the duration 
of starvation after which even ad libitum feeding 
will not return the animal to health.  It will never 
molt and eventually will die.  Dagg (1977) has 
studied starvation effects in copepods, but not the 
interaction with the molt cycle, and effects of less 
than replete diets on zooplankton have been 
studied very little, apart from those on egg 
production. 
 
I think that copepodites have exactly this sort of 
Anger–Sulkin growth pattern.  One piece of 
evidence is that copepodites brought in from the 
field, sorted to stage, and held in filtered seawater 
continue to molt for over half of their expected 
molt-to-molt interval (Fig. 27).  This implies that 
they have a PRS.  They can successfully molt 
because they have, by ~30% of the intermolt 
interval, accumulated a large fraction of the 
expected full-nutrition growth increment, exactly 
as shown for crab zoeae.  Crain and Miller (2000) 
found evidence for this occurring in the field.  We 
showed that copepodites of Calanus finmarchicus 
with postmolt exoskeletal facies (newly molted) 
accumulated during a starvation event (Campbell 
et al., 2001) over Georges Bank, northwest 
Atlantic Ocean.  Individuals caught by the food 
shortage early in a stage, say C
x
, did not advance 
from the postmolt condition, while those past PRS 
molted to C
x+1
, raising the fraction of postmolt 
individuals.  Also, those in C
x–1
, and already past 
the PRS, proceeded to molt, contributing more to 
the fraction of postmolt individuals in C
x
.  Such an 
increase was demonstrated in several stages. 
 
In any case, to measure growth effectively, 
especially in comparing food-replete (western) and 
food-limited (eastern) circumstances in the 
subarctic Pacific, we need an accurate model of 
copepod growth rate, one including its oscillation 
at the period of the molt cycle.  Some 
experimental work on this problem of a correct 
growth model can proceed before OECOS reaches 
its field research stage.

days (~30% of the intermolt interval) the animal has achieved over half of the growth for the stage.

Individual biomass  –  Instrumentation 
 
In order to get growth data from the field 
sufficiently resolved to model individual growth, it 
is probably necessary to have individual measures 
of copepod mass.  Either dry weight or carbon 
content of one, newly molted C1 of the species of 
interest should be measurable.  These measures 
should also be made at sea, if at all possible, so 
that (1) no preservation artifacts are introduced 
(carbon loss to aldehyde solutions, body breakage 
and lipid/tissue-fluid loss on thawing, etc.),  
(2) coloration patterns will be available to assist 
with identification, and (3) the data set will arrive 
ashore finished.  Refined determinations of mass 
are possible at sea, despite the wild accelerations 
affecting a ship in a seaway (Childress and 
Mickel, 1980).  A modernized version of this 
comparative electrobalance system might get 
down to masses of a few μg, a sensitivity that will 
be required to obtain individual masses.   
 
Another approach is the ‘Salonen machine’ 
(Salonen, 1979) for carbon analysis.  This has 
never been fully exploited, except by Salonen 
himself and a few of his colleagues in Finland.  It 
is ‘just’ a carbon analyzer.  Salonen’s device is a 
small furnace (actually a quartz tube packed with 
catalyst at 950°C) for combusting minute samples 
of organic matter in an oxygen stream that then 
passes into a non-dispersive infrared gas analyzer 
(NDIR detector).  Salonen claimed, and other 
workers have confirmed (H.-J. Hirche, pers. 
comm.), sensitivity of 0.01 μg carbon, with an 
upper limit of 2 mg, approximately the 
requirement for individual, oil-filled N. cristatus 
C5.  Combustion and accuracy are independent of 
moisture content, so whole animals can be 
converted into carbon numbers after simple 
blotting.  With suitable auxiliary detectors, 
nitrogen can be determined also.  A commercial 
version sold for a while by Salonen was finicky in 
use (Hirche, pers. comm.), but gave reliable results 
with sufficient care.  Hirche has used it to 
determine carbon content in single eggs of 
Calanus.  Particularly with Neocalanus spp. and 
Eucalanus, which store large fractions of lipids, 
this carbon data will be most useful if we can 
partition carbon content into storage (lipid) and 
active tissue fractions.  It is possible that lipids can 
 
   
67
be extracted, and then both lipid and residual 
fractions can be measured separately.  It is also 
possible that lipid content can be estimated from 
pictures (Miller et al., 2000), which are also useful 
for length measurements (we must be able to 
determine ‘condition factors’, that is, mass relative 
to body length and volume).  Then the whole 
animal can be used for the carbon estimation.   
 
Before we approach the fieldwork, we must model 
age-within-stage variation of growth (of mass) as 
it interacts with (1) age-within-stage composition 
change through time (cohort progress) and  
(2) individual variation to determine how many 
individual masses must be measured to adequately 
evaluate growth patterns.  If all five major species 
are evaluated, the at-sea work load (sampling, 
sorting, videography, and combustion analysis) 
will be considerable.  This will require further 
detailed planning.  Planning should also include 
detailed consideration of other techniques:  
colorimetric protein analysis (e.g., Coomassie 
Blue or bicinchoninic acid binding of protein with 
spectrophotometry, modified Lowry oxidation, 
and several other alternatives), an alternate lipid 
analysis, and much more.   
 
The OECOS time-series study of copepod size and 
growth within a season for a single year must be 
conducted in the face of substantial year-to-year 
variability in growth conditions for interzonally 
migrating copepod species in the subarctic Pacific 
(e.g., Miller et al., 1992; Miller, 1993a; Mackas et 
al., 1998; Kobari et al., 2003a).  This variation is 
well documented by the studies cited with respect 
to prosome lengths.  It is not well characterized in 
terms of biomass and condition factors, but 
because of the approximately cubic mass to length 
relationship, the variation is much larger.  For 
example, I found (Miller, 1993a) a huge difference 
in N. flemingeri C5 individual biomass between 
1987 and 1988 at Station P (50°N, 145°W).  In 
1988 randomly selected individuals were 400 μg 
DW, while lipid-packed individuals in 1987 were 
only 270 μg DW.  At 53°N in 1988 random 
individuals were up to 800 μg DW.  Evidently the 
mass variation, when a stage (particularly C5) is 
fully grown and ready for molt or diapause, can 
amount to a factor of 3 or more.  
 
The role of food availability in establishing this 
interannual (and latitudinal; see Kobari et al., 
2003a) variation should be illuminated by the west 
vs. east comparison proposed for OECOS, which 
is expected to be between replete and strongly 
food-limited conditions, respectively.  For the 
comparison to be valid, it is critical that methods 
be standardized for application on both sides of the 
Pacific.  A great deal of information exchange 
should be undertaken to make this standardization 
possible.  It will probably be desirable to have 
North American and Asian technical groups (the 
people who will make the measurements at sea) 
work together on a pilot study someplace to allow 
instrumental standardization for the measurement 
process.  Possibly OECOS can include some 
sampling apart from our main, extended time 
series to get at the issue of longer-term variation in 
growth conditions.  The simplest approach would 
be a few years of mid-summer samples of  
N. plumchrus C5 and N. flemingeri females in 
diapause taken at depth after the main growing 
season.  This could be part of other programs on 
both sides of the Pacific. 
 
Biomolecular approaches to growth rate 
determination 
 
In an early general essay on the OECOS idea, I 
suggested that one or several recently developed 
methods for growth rate determination, based on 
levels of nucleic acid or on activity of specific 
hormone or enzyme groups, might be applicable.  
After a study of the papers, I doubt that any of 
these will have sufficient precision to be of much 
use in quantitative characterization of individual 
growth.  Partly, this is because it will likely be 
impossible to determine the phase of growth 
(particularly within the molt cycle) to which an 
analysis applies.  I may well be wrong.  However, 
any of these techniques might be useful in bulk 
comparisons of growth averaged across many 
individuals between west (food replete) and east 
(food limited).  Each of them has substantial cost 
in analytical work.  
 
Techniques proposed in the literature are 
estimation of RNA:DNA ratio (Wagner et al. 
1998, 2001), aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity 
(AARS, Yebra and Hernández-León, 2004), 
ecdysone titers (Johnson 2004) and chitobiase 
activity (Sastri and Roff, 2000).  The assumption 
 
   
68
of RNA:DNA ratios is that most RNA in cells is in 
ribosomes active in protein synthesis, while all 
DNA is nuclear and stays in fixed ratio to cell 
number.  Thus, if faster growth requires more 
protein synthesis and more ribosomes, it will be 
signaled by higher RNA:DNA.  Wagner et al. 
(2001) have shown this is correct.  However, 
RNA:DNA also correlates positively to stage of 
development (Fig. 28A), or to body weight, even 
though successive stage growth rates are 
progressively slower.  They overcame that 
limitation by normalizing RNA:DNA to protein 
content, after which they were able (mostly) to 
show a difference in ratio between copepodites on 
replete diets (growth rate set at 100% in Fig. 28B) 
and copepodites on reduced rations (growth rate 
divided by that for high food levels).  Clearly the 
required effect is present, but it is buried several 
layers inside the growth regulation mechanics of 
copepodites.  A meaningful study in the field for 
Neocalanus spp. would require a preliminary 
rearing study comparable in detail and excellence 
to that done by Wagner et al. (2001).  A field time 
series would require RNA, DNA, and protein 
measurements on very large numbers of 
individuals or samples.  Moreover, even their 
results (Fig. 28B) show large scatter, some of it 
likely from not distinguishing Anger–Sulkin 
growth phases. 
 
 
Fig. 28 (A) RNA, DNA, and RNA:DNA for Calanus finmarchicus reared in the laboratory at high, medium, and 
low rations.  Both variables and the ratio increase with stage (and size).  Note that RNA increases logarithmically 
with stage; DNA increases linearly.  (B) Protein and carbon growth rates, both as a percentage of the rate at high 
food level (100%) plotted against RNA:DNA divided by protein content.  This comparison does show that 
RNA:DNA responds to growth rate, although in a complex fashion.  From Wagner et al. (2001). 
 
   
69
 
The AARS technique has an assumption like that 
of RNA:DNA, that is, faster protein synthesis 
must require more activity tacking amino acids 
onto transfer RNA, which is the function of 
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.  There are 20 of 
these enzymes in virtually all animals, all active 
all of the time, one for each amino acid.  Yebra 
and Hernández-León (2004) measured overall 
AARS activity in plankter homogenates (15 to 30 
Daphnia required in the original description) by 
determining the release rate of pyrophosphate 
(PPi, i.e., PO
4
-PO
4
 released as adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) is converted to adenosine 
monophosphate (AMP), the energy charge going 
to bind lysine, etc. to tRNA).  PPi is analyzed by 
its reaction with NADH (nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide), which can be followed with a 
spectrophotometer.  Unfortunately, the corre-
lations demonstrated between growth rate and 
AARS activity in Daphnia, while statistically 
significant, were too weak to be useful for our 
studies of individual growth, even if the assay 
could be miniaturized to determine AARS in one 
Neocalanus early copepodite.  Some of the weak 
correlation may come from the fact that PPi is 
released by a few other reactions beside AARS 
activity.  Possibly AARS measures would be good 
enough to show gross regional differences, such as 
those between the western and eastern subarctic 
Pacific.  Like RNA:DNA, we would need an 
independent evaluation of AARS to growth 
relations in our copepods. 
Both ecdysone measures and chitobiase activity 
relate to the molting process.  Ecdysone has only 
been measured by radio-immuno-assay (RIA) and 
not in single individuals (Johnson, 2004).  It 
requires complex instrumentation and use of 
radioisotopes.  Much like molting-rate studies, it 
would only show high levels as substantial 
numbers in a cohort approached molt.  Johnson 
used it to show differences between actively 
developing individuals and diapause individuals.  
That is not an issue for OECOS.  The best measure 
of diapause onset is more likely to be development 
of high levels of molecular chaperone (heat shock) 
proteins in animals that have not been heat 
shocked.  Chitobiase breaks down the inner layer 
of the old exoskeleton prior to molting, and at 
molting it is released into the surrounding water.  
Sastri and Roff (2000) have proposed measures of 
its activity in the water as a general measure of 
secondary production rates.  The enzyme breaks 
down in the water with a time constant around 1 
day, so that the activity at any given time depends 
upon the amount of recent molting (perhaps the 
surface area of recently shed exoskeleton).  This 
has not, to my knowledge, been applied to a field 
situation.  Results would depend upon stock size 
as much as stock activity, and separating those 
sources of variability would depend upon reliable 
stock measures.  I would not propose applying 
either of these methods at present.

Ecological importance  
 
Large interzonally migrating (IZM) zooplankton, 
such as Neocalanus spp. and Eucalanus bungii, 
are predominant in the entire subarctic Pacific and 
its marginal seas (Mackas and Tsuda, 1999).  They 
account for more than 70% of summer 
zooplankton biomass in the Oyashio waters 
(Vinogradov, 1997).  Because these species prey 
on diatoms, flagellates, and ciliates (Tsuda and 
Sugisaki, 1994; Kobari et al., 2003b), they have 
important roles in carbon uptake from two 
different food webs, the ‘grazing’ and microbial 
food webs.  On the other hand, they are major 
carbon pathways to animals at higher trophic 
levels, as the food items for various fishes (Odate, 
1994; Beamish et al., 1999; Yamamura et al., 
2002), sea birds (Russell et al., 1999), and whales 
(Kawamura, 1982).  Therefore, they are key 
species in the subarctic marine ecosystem.  
Moreover, their fecal pellets and downward 
migrations are considered to be a significant 
biological pump with large carbon flux (Kobari et 
al., 2003b). 
 
Recent studies in the western subarctic Pacific 
 
Over the past 6 years, knowledge of the life 
histories of IZM copepods has become better 
integrated (8 published papers) for the western 
subarctic Pacific (Oyashio).  Life cycles of 
Neocalanus spp. in the west are annual (Tsuda et 
al., 1999, 2001; Kobari and Ikeda, 1999, 2000, 
2001a,b).  Lipid-rich eggs are produced below  
500 m depth from autumn to winter, and then rise 
or migrate upward while hatching and molting 
through the naupliar stages.  Neocalanus cristatus 
appears at the surface first, followed by N. 
flemingeri and then N. plumchrus.  Throughout the 
spring phytoplankton bloom, they develop into 
(Stage 5) C5, except for a small part of the 
population of N. flemingeri that stops at C4.  After 
mid-summer, the young specimens migrate 
downward to overwinter, the C5 of N. flemingeri 
maturing and mating on the way down, with 
females as the main resting stage. 
 
For E. bungii, two different patterns are proposed 
for their life histories in the western subarctic 
Pacific (Shoden et al., 2005; Tsuda et al., 2005a).  
In an annual pattern, newly recruited specimens 
with early birth dates develop into C4 in that year, 
overwinter at depth, and mature during the spring 
phytoplankton bloom in the next year.  A biennial 
pattern is more complicated.  Newly recruited 
specimens with late birth dates reach C3 in the 
current year, overwinter at depth, and develop to 
C5 by mid-summer in the next year.  After a 
second overwintering, they mature during the 
spring phytoplankton bloom.  During the years 
with prolonged phytoplankton blooms, they can 
develop into C6 females and again overwinter.  
These patterns are flexibly varied with 
oceanographic conditions, mainly food supply 
(Shoden et al., 2005; Tsuda et al., 2005a). 
 
With increasing knowledge of life history in the 
western subarctic Pacific, east–west differences 
can be discussed.  The western subarctic Pacific is 
characterized by large seasonal fluctuations of 
oceanographic conditions, and massive and early 
phytoplankton blooms (Saito et al., 2002).  
Eucalanus bungii is most sensitive to these 
oceanographic conditions.  On the western side, 
the life span is shortened, and the postembryonic 
development and reproductive seasons are early.  
It is considered that life span is shortened by high 
growth under high food availability, and spawning 
and development seasons are synchronized with 
the seasonal peak of primary production (Shoden 
et al., 2005; Tsuda et al., 2005a).  Unlike  
E. bungii, Neocalanus spp. shows similar patterns 
and timing between the two sites (Tsuda et al., 
1999; Kobari and Ikeda, 1999, 2001a,b), with an 
exception for the small part of N. flemingeri which 
has a biennial life history on the western side, 
(Kobari and Ikeda, 2001a). 
 
 
   
71
Carbon flow through Neocalanus spp. has been 
estimated using time-series data (Kobari et al., 
2003b).  In the western subarctic Pacific, primary 
production is very high due to massive 
phytoplankton blooms.  Annual Neocalanus 
production is computed to be 19.3 gC m
–2
 year
–1
 
and accounts for 7% of primary production.  
Removing 4.3 gC m
–2
 year
–1 
from annual 
production to dormant populations, the remainder 
is considered to be surface mortality.  If predation 
is the major part of mortality, Neocalanus 
contributes to carbon flow with high transfer 
efficiency.  On the other hand, the ecological 
importance of dormant populations is also 
considerable.  Although sinking particles and 
downward migrations both contribute to carbon 
flux (Fowler and Knauer, 1986), loss during 
downward migrations is extremely low compared 
to that of sinking particles.  Thus, downward 
migrations by zooplankton are a very efficient and 
effective aspect of the biological pump.  For 
Neocalanus spp., most of the seasonal downward 
migration can be considered to be carbon export 
flux because they end their life history at depth.  
The estimated export (4.3 gC m
–2
 year
–1
) is similar 
to the sinking particle flux (4.7 gC m
–2
 year
–1
, 
Honda, 2000).  Considering the large standing 
stock, the downward migration could be a 
significant component of global carbon flux.   
 
Important subjects remaining to address 
 
Knowledge of distribution, life cycle, and feeding 
has been integrated for the large IZM copepods 
since the 1980s.  However, there is little 
information on growth, production, and 
interannual variations.  All of those should be 
included in developing ecosystem models for 
subarctic waters.  Although knowledge of long-
term changes has been recently integrated (Kobari 
et al., 2003a; Chiba et al., 2004; Tadokoro et al., 
2005), growth processes are still unquantified and 
should be studied because they are sensitive 
parameters in population dynamics.  Based on the 
results from the Bering Shelf (Vidal and Smith, 
1986), observed growth rates were much different 
from the estimates of some empirical models, such 
as the temperature-dependent model of Huntley 
and Lopez (1992) and the temperature–weight 
dependent models of Ikeda and Motoda (1978), 
Hirst and Sheader (1997) and Hirst and Lampitt 
(1998).   Especially strong weight-dependence of 
growth is observed for late stages.  That might 
result from the weakly developed muscles and 
stored lipids that apparently are preparation for 
molt-to-the-adult stage, egg production, and 
lowered metabolism (Kobari and Ikeda, 1999, 
2001a,b; Tsuda et al., 2001).  Therefore, it is 
difficult to estimate growth rate from the empirical 
models.   
 
Moreover, importance of growth processes (and 
also mortality) is suggested by the results of the 
long-term changes in seasonal abundance of  
E. bungii in the western subarctic Pacific (Kobari 
et al., MS).  Adults usually appeared in spring 
over the study period.  However, newly recruited 
specimens and late stages did not occur until mid-
summer in the 1970s and 1990s, while they 
disappeared by early summer in the 1980s.  These 
findings reveal variations in the progression from 
spawning to postembryonic development to 
dormancy.  In the Oyashio, phytoplankton blooms 
terminated early in the 1980s but were long-lasting 
in the 1990s.  These results suggest that growth 
(and morality) during postembryonic development 
determines the yearly fluctuations of abundance of 
this copepod.  As spring phytoplankton blooms 
vary in timing, location, and magnitude in the 
western subarctic Pacific, the copepod develop-
mental responses could be correspondingly varied.   
This highly variable interaction remains to be 
documented at the moment because of the short 
development time at the surface and the 
complicated hydrography of the Oyashio, which is 
influenced by Kuroshio warm core rings, strong 
tidal mixing around the Kuril Islands, and variable 
wind patterns.  
  
Prospective subjects in the OECOS program 
 
I would like to propose prospective reseach 
subjects for the OECOS program.  A high-
frequency sample collection would resolve  
(1) stage duration time and (2) growth and 
mortality rates.  Better growth and mortality rate 
estimates for these oceanic copepods could 
improve our global models, which are mostly 
constructed from coastal species (Huntly and 
Lopez, 1992; Hirst and Sheader, 1997; Hirst and 
Lampitt, 1998; Hirst and Kiørboe, 2002).  Details 
of population dynamics and life history strategies 
 
   
72
would be resolved by these findings, as reported 
for Calanus finmarchicus (Hirche et al., 2001; 
Ohman et al., 2001).  By comparing new western 
area OECOS studies with the eastern OECOS 
findings, and with the results of SEEDS/SERIES 
(Tsuda et al., 2005b), controlling factor(s) of 
growth and mortality could be evaluated.  These 
findings could resolve the responses of life cycle 
strategies to phytoplankton blooms, especially for 
Neocalanus spp. that have similar seasonal 
patterns between the east and the west.  Moreover, 
the information on (3) body allometry,  
(4) chemical or fatty acid composition, (5) feeding 
or ingestion rate, and (6) daily changes in vertical 
distribution could suggest what factors initiate and 
terminate dormancy.  Finally, all of these findings 
can yield estimates of (7) production rate and 
carbon export by the downward migration of IZM 
copepods in the western subarctic Pacific.

F. MODELING 
 
Modern study of any complex ocean process involves modeling.  Lower trophic level interactions in the 
subarctic Pacific, from nutrient dynamics to copepod growth (and, of course, beyond that) certainly 
qualify as complex.  Modeling all of the processes, interactions, and cycles that are of interest to OECOS 
will require substantial and inventive intellectual effort.  Dr. Harold Batchelder has undertaken to survey 
what is required.

Introduction and modeling needed to support 
OECOS investigations 
  
The eastern and western subartic gyres have 
similar mesozooplankton species composition, but 
differing seasonal cycles and differing amplitudes 
of primary production.  OECOS proposes to 
compare the trophodynamics and population 
dynamics of the lower trophic levels of these two 
gyres using similar observations over an extended 
period in the spring, the season when the 
differences between the two gyres are most 
dramatic.  (See elsewhere in this report for 
examples of these differences.)  In my view, there 
are three OECOS-related issues in which modeling 
before and during the program can advance our 
understanding of the differences between these 
two gyres:  (1) ecosystem modeling that includes 
iron availability as a prognostic variable,  
(2) modeling that explores physical–biological 
coupling and considers potential top-down 
(mesozooplankton-grazing) or wasp-waist 
(microzooplankton-grazing) driven trophic 
cascades, perhaps generating cycles, and  
(3) individual-based or age–weight structured 
population dynamics models of the growth of 
mesozooplankton.  It is possible that a single 
model may be used for the first two of these 
topics.  The third topic (growth of meso-
zooplankton) requires models of individual species 
that include behaviors and details that cannot be 
readily represented in the more aggregated 
ecosystem models that would be used for the first 
two topics. 
Ecosystem modeling – Fe considerations 
 
Ecosystem modeling is data intensive.  Data are 
needed for estimating the parameters that govern 
fluxes of material among model states, and for 
validation and comparison purposes.  Thus, model 
state variables are usually considered based on 
functional units (e.g., herbivorous grazers, 
omnivores, etc.), which implies simplification to a 
manageable number of state variables.  
Consequently, much of the ecosystem modeling in 
oceanic domains has occurred for a relatively few 
locations which have had both long observational 
data series and intensive field experimental 
programs, including Hawaiian Ocean Time Series 
(HOTS), Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS), 
and Ocean Weathership Stations (OWS) like 
OWS-Papa in the subarctic Pacific (Batchelder 
and Miller, 1989; Miller et al., 1991; Frost and 
Kishi, 1999; Strom et al., 2000).  OWS-Papa data 
sets (observations, annual cycles in wind, mixing, 
and solar radiation) have been used extensively for 
box and one-dimensional modeling of planktonic 
ecosystems (Frost, 1987, 1993; Denman and Peña, 
1999, 2002), many with the goal of understanding 
why phytoplankton blooms do not occur in the 
high-nitrate low-chlorophyll (HNLC) subarctic 
Pacific.  In the last 18 years, there has been an 
appreciation of the potential role of iron as a 
regulator of primary productivity in oceanic 
HNLC regions, like the Southern Ocean, eastern 
equatorial Pacific, and subarctic Pacific (Martin et 
al., 1989; Coale et al., 1996; many others).  Iron 
supply to HNLC regions can occur through 
 
   
74
atmospheric processes, such as deposition of 
terrestrially-derived dust (Mahowald et al., 1999; 
Fung et al., 2000), through oceanic processes via 
upwelling of deep waters with higher Fe 
concentration, and by interactions with sediments 
near the coast.   Basin- and global-scale ecosystem 
models have not, until recently, included iron 
dynamics or the impacts of this micronutrient on 
biogeochemistry and ecological processes.  In the 
last few years iron cyling has been included in 
both local one-dimensional simulations and three-
dimensional circulations (Leonard et al., 1999; 
Arrigo et al., 2003; Aumont et al., 2003; Moore et 
al., 2004; Dutkiewicz et al., 2005).  Many of the 
three-dimensional iron-limited ecosystem models 
are global and, therefore, have only coarse spatial 
resolution.  OECOS proposes nearly parallel 
studies of two specific regions of the subarctic 
Pacific for which the relative importance of Fe 
supply likely differs.  At subarctic latitudes, winds 
are predominantly from the west and Asian dusts 
are probably the primary atmospheric source; 
atmospheric Fe supply is likely to be significantly 
greater in the Oyashio and western subarctic gyre 
than in the eastern gyre.  Conversely, open ocean 
upwelling of deep water is likely to be a larger 
(relative) contributor to Fe surface supply in the 
eastern gyre than in the western gyre.  These 
differences are amenable to high-resolution (both 
vertical and horizontal) ecosystem models that 
consider both atmospheric dust (and Fe) supply 
and in situ Fe dynamics.  Bioavailable Fe 
concentrations and dynamics are dependent upon 
supply rates (Fung et al., 2000), dissociation and 
complexation constants (and rates) (Shaked et al., 
2005), and concentrations of natural organic 
ligands (humics and fulvics) and other 
compounds, like siderophores (Barbeau et al., 
2003) that form complexes with Fe.  Any or all of 
these can be included in models.  To develop 
ecologically useful models, it will be important to 
isolate system-controlling aspects of this 
complexity. 
 
Ecosystem modeling – Trophic cascades and 
biomass cycling 
 
Modeling of trophic cascade dynamics, imposed 
perhaps by microzooplankton grazing (removal of 
primary producer biomass and regeneration to 
inorganic nutrients (including Fe)), would 
complement the intensive time-series collections 
planned as part of OECOS.  Colleagues and I 
(Edwards et al., 2000a,b) examined temporal and 
spatial responses (one-dimensional and two-
dimensional) of a simple nutrient-phytoplankton-
zooplankton (NPZ) ecosystem model that was 
parameterized with either mesozooplankton 
grazers or microzooplankton grazers.  The two 
parameterizations differed in that the 
microzooplankton grazers had maximum grazing 
rates 8 times higher, slightly greater nonlinearity 
in their Ivlev grazing function, and substantially 
lower growth efficiency (higher remineralization 
rate of nutrient) than the macrozooplankton 
grazers.  The base macrozooplankton parameters 
have been used in previous studies (Franks and 
Walstad, 1997).  The modifications for 
microzooplankton are based on growth rate 
estimates and gross growth efficiencies from 
Strom and Morello (1998) and Straile (1997), 
respectively.  In the absence of vertical diffusion, 
the models exhibited different behaviors (stable 
fixed point and oscillatory limit cyles), depending 
on the maximum phytoplankton growth rate (a 
function of depth, that is, available irradiance) and 
parameter choices.  The macrozooplankton 
system, with vertical diffusion, became more 
stable.  Conversely, the coupled diffusive-
microzooplankton simulation remained unstable, 
with large oscillations, even at high mixing rates.  
Nearly full-scale fluctuations (from almost none of 
the nitrogen to almost all of the nitrogen in the 
state variable) occur on time scales of tens of days 
to many months, depending on the parameters, the 
depth, and magnitude of diffusion.  In the two-
dimensional model, different parameterizations 
(macro- vs. microzooplankton) led to different 
spatial scales of variability in an upwelling system 
(Edwards et al., 2000a).  Phytoplankton and 
zooplankton maxima are quite narrowly banded in 
the microzooplankton simulation, and near-surface 
nutrient levels remain high over most of the model 
domain.  In the macrozooplanton simulation, the 
bands of high phytoplankton near shore and high 
zooplankton offshore are much broader, and 
nutrient concentrations offshore are quite low at 
the surface.

Ecosystem modeling – Mesozooplankton 
growth and development dynamics 
 
Comparisons of the growth and development rates 
of the same copepod species in the two subarctic 
gyres are a key goal of OECOS.  Modeling of 
growth processes should proceed in parallel with 
the observations and experiments planned.  
Different, more detailed models are necessary to 
examine within-cohort growth dynamics.  Either 
individual-based models or age–weight structured 
multi-class models could be used to explore the 
responses of the species to variations in 
temperature, prey type and prey abundance in the 
two gyres.  Individual-based modeling (IBM) is an 
appropriate framework for identifying the 
processes controlling growth and development of 
particular copepods, such as Neocalanus 
plumchrus and N. flemingeri, and for examining 
the impacts, at the population level, of processes 
that affect individuals.  One of these phenomena is 
the progression of stage distribution during the 
short period in April–May when these Neocalanus 
spp. are developing and laying up lipid reserves 
for the extended, deep-dwelling diapause phase of 
their life cycle.  Individual-based models are 
capable of incorporating the complex processes 
involved in morphogenesis, lipidogenesis, growth 
and molting.   
 
An unanswered question in the eastern subarctic 
gyre is:  Why does N. flemingeri spawn earlier and 
more precisely focused in time than N. plumchrus?  
Individual-based modeling (IBM), like that done 
previously to examine seasonal cycles of 
development and growth for Metridia spp. 
(Batchelder and Miller, 1989; Batchelder and 
Williams, 1995), and to examine feeding depths, 
physiological and behavioral controls of individual 
copepods and their impact on transport and 
residence times, and demography, will be valuable 
in deciphering the dynamics of the large IZM 
Neocalanus of the subarctic Pacific.   Individual-
based models, coupled with the ecosystem models 
described in the previous sections, could be used 
to compare the ecodynamics of Neocalanus in the 
food-deplete eastern and food-replete (at least for 
a short period in spring) western gyres of the 
subarctic North Pacific.

III. Reports from Workshop Breakout Groups 
 
The Workshop included almost a full day of discussions in three smaller groups assigned to consider  
(1) physical and chemical aspects of the ecosystem, (2) phytoplankton and micrograzers, (3) and 
mesozooplankton.  Each group prepared a written report, edited versions of which are provided here. 
 
A. PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL ASPECTS WITH EMPHASIS ON IRON AND 
IRON SPECIATION 
 
Participants:  Zanna Chase, Timothy Cowles, Jay Cullen, Kenshi Kuma and Peter Strutton 
 
 
The subarctic Pacific is one of three main high-
nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) ecosystems in 
the world ocean.  We know that adding iron to 
certain parts of this ecosystem, at certain times of 
the year, can produce dramatic increases in 
phytoplankton stocks and growth rates (Boyd and 
Harrison, 1999; Tsuda et al., 2003).  However, 
important questions remain unanswered regarding 
the coupling between iron and biology at a range 
of temporal, spatial and trophic scales; the role of 
iron speciation; the role of iron in the existence 
and character of biological limit cycles; and the 
importance of episodic dust events.  An iron 
chemistry component is critical to the success of 
OECOS, and also represents a unique opportunity 
to further our fundamental understanding of iron 
cycling in an HNLC ecosystem.   
 
Hypotheses 
 
A number of hypotheses related to iron availability 
were put forward by the group: 
 
1. East–west differences in ecosystem structure 
are driven by iron.  Our assumption is that the 
western Pacific receives higher iron inputs 
from Asian dust sources.  A corollary of this 
hypothesis is:  Phytoplankton in the western 
Pacific have higher Fe:C ratios. 
  
2. Lack of bioavailable iron sets the upper limit 
of phytoplankton limit cycles.  A corollary of 
this hypothesis is:  Iron concentration and/or 
iron speciation shows cyclical behavior in the 
subarctic Pacific, in synchrony with biological 
cycles. 
 
3. Episodic dust inputs modulate the upper limit 
of the cycles. 
 
4. The lower chlorophyll limit is set by iron 
limitation of microzooplankton, or more 
generally, iron limitation has a direct, 
physiological impact on higher trophic levels. 
 
Proposed measurements 
 
A set of iron-related measurements to be included 
in OECOS, in decreasing order of priority, is listed 
here together with a brief justification of the 
measurement and the proposed methodology. 
 
1. Total dissolved Fe.  This is the standard for 
iron measurements.  It includes filtration 
through a 0.2 µm filter and acidification to  
pH < 2.  It can be measured at sea using flow 
injection techniques.  Archived samples would 
be stored for possible future, shore-based 
analysis of additional metals (with separate 
funding). 
 
2. Organically complexed Fe.  This is the 
dominant form of iron in the ocean.  It can be 
accessed by phytoplankton, but is not as 
readily available as free iron.  The ligands are 
most likely produced by microorganisms. 
Quantification and characterization includes 
ligand concentration and a conditional stability 
constant by competitive ligand equilibration/ 
adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry 
(Gledhill and Van Den Berg, 1994; Rue and 
Bruland, 1995) and is best done at sea. 
 
 
   
78
3. Particulate Fe.  This includes all iron, cellular 
and lithogenic iron, caught by a 0.2 µm filter. 
If filters are washed to remove extracellular 
metals (Tovar-Sanchez et al., 2003), one can 
estimate the biological Fe:C quota.  It would 
be interesting to relate this to iron-stress.  
Samples would be stored for future analysis by 
Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass 
Specrometry (ICP-MS) (Cullen and Sherrell, 
1999). 
 
4. Fe(II).  It is more soluble than Fe(III), but 
with a rapid turnover.  Since phytoplankton 
reduce Fe(III) before taking it up, Fe(II) is 
more available (Maldonado et al., 2001; 
Maldonado and Price, 2001; Shaked et al., 
2004).  Measurement is tricky because of a 
short half-life.  Samples are best run inline 
using a flow injection, chemiluminescence 
method (Croot and Laan, 2002).  Fe(II) is 
likely to be the most variable Fe fraction, even 
on sub-daily time scales, affected by 
irradiance, O
2
, temperature, and pH. 
 
5. Bioavailable Fe.  There is no single accepted 
method of chemically determining 
bioavailable iron.  Wells et al. (1991) 
proposed a method based on the reactivity of 
iron to oxine.  The method is fairly simple, 
and a time series of these measurements could 
be interesting when combined with other 
measurements. 
 
6. Aerosol Fe. There is a paucity of direct 
measurements of dust deposition to the open 
ocean, for obvious reasons.  The continuous 
occupation of an open ocean station, as 
proposed in OECOS, would be a great 
opportunity to collect important data from a 
region known to be influenced by episodic 
dust events (Bishop et al., 2002).  We would 
consult with William Landing (University of 
Florida) on how to deploy an aerosol sampler 
from a ship.  Care would need to be taken in 
positioning the ship during sampling.  Samples 
would be analyzed on shore.  As an 
alternative, surface aluminum could be 
measured as a proxy for dust input (Measures 
and Vink, 2000). 
 
Iron and biology 
 
The group will facilitate collection of clean water 
for biological experiments (see below).  The 
advantage of routinely measuring iron 
concentrations in (non-radioactive) incubation 
bottles was also discussed.  However, the number 
of such measurements needs to be kept at a 
reasonable level, unless a very large number of 
iron analysts and iron analyzers is brought on 
board.  We estimate that one iron flow injection 
analysis (FIA) system, being run continuously 
(i.e., with two analysts), could process at most 40 
samples per day.  
 
It would be good to include an iron biologist as 
part of OECOS, meaning someone who does iron-
specific experiments on microorganisms, at sea. 
This person could measure rates of iron uptake and 
biologically-mediated changes in iron speciation.  
Expertise and insight are also needed to detect 
direct effects of iron on higher trophic levels. 
Finally, the group is interested in working with the 
modelers to include iron in the biological model. 
 
Sampling 
 
Sampling of the mixed layer, for all species, 
should be done once a day.  In addition, one water 
column profile (to at least 1000 m) should be 
taken once every 2 days, for total dissolved Fe 
only, to serve as quality control.  Two to four 
times during the experiment high-resolution, 
around-the-clock sampling for Fe(II) should be 
conducted in order to look for diel variability. 
 
There are two approaches to sampling.  The first is 
a Go-Flo rosette, with clean bottles mounted in an 
epoxy-coated frame and lowered on Kevlar line. 
Dr. Cullen has access to a package like this as part 
of a Canadian collaboration.  Advantages of this 
approach are clean samples from well-defined 
depths, minimal disturbance to fragile cells, and 
no limit on sampling depth.  Disadvantages 
include cost, deployment time, possibility of 
bottle-to-bottle variability, and the challenge of 
clean sampling and filtration. 
 
 
   
79
The second approach is to use a ship-based 
pumping system coupled to a submerged ‘fish’. 
Such a system could profile to at least 40 m. 
Advantages of this approach include rapid 
deployment, ease of obtaining large volumes of 
clean water, high vertical resolution, ease of 
sampling and filtering clean water (which can be 
done in a clean hood with inline filtering), and low 
cost.  The main disadvantages are the limited 
depth range and the unknown extent to which 
pumping may adversely affect fragile organisms. 
 
The best solution is to bring both the pumping and 
the rosette system.  The rosette can be used to 
collect samples for biological experiments, and for 
deep profiles, and the pump can be used for 
continuous underway mapping and high-temporal 
resolution studies of iron speciation (particularly 
Fe(II)). 
  
East–west comparison 
 
The Eastern and Western Groups will use the same 
analytical method (chemiluminescence FIA) and 
filter size (0.2µm) for measuring dissolved Fe. 
Both groups will acidify samples to pH 2 and will 
compare measurements to the Sampling and 
Analysis of Iron (SAFe) standard seawater. 
  
Iron complexation measurements by cathode 
stripping voltammetry (CSV) are not currently 
planned for the Western Group.  Drs. Takeda and 
Obata have expertise in these measurements which 
could be included if resources allow.  
 
One major difference between the two groups is 
that the Western Group determines particulate Fe 
by the difference between a filtered and an 
unfiltered sample (stored for at least 3 months), 
whereas the Eastern Group measures particulate 
Fe by collecting the particles.  The Eastern Group 
will make some comparisons of these two 
methods. 
 
The Western Group is not planning any Fe(II) 
measurements.  The group decided that size-
fractionated dissolved Fe (e.g., colloids) is very 
labor intensive and is not necessary.

B. PHYTOPLANKTON/MICROZOOPLANKTON STUDIES 
 
Participants:  Harold P. Batchelder, Deanna Erdner, Ken Furuya, Takahashi Ota, Sei-ichi Saitoh, 
Karen Selph, Suzanne Strom and Nicholas Welschmeyer 
 
 
The group focused on two primary issues: 
 
1. Identifying the most profitable geographic 
region(s) for an east–west subarctic 
comparision, and outlining the key questions 
surrounding this geographic comparison; 
 
2. Identifying the large-scale, unifying questions 
that might be addressed by a subarctic Pacific 
plankton research program, with particular 
attention paid to links between lower trophic 
levels (phyto- and microzooplankton) and 
interzonal migrator copepod species. 
 
Identifying geographic region(s) for east–west 
comparison 
  
Discussion started from the premise that work in 
the eastern subarctic would occur in the open gyre, 
the site of previous research identifying chronic 
iron limitation, biomass limit cycles within the 
microbial community, decadal changes in the 
timing of Neocalanus plumchrus ontogenetic 
vertical migration, and other important, yet poorly 
understood, planktonic processes.  The group felt 
that, although Site H is located in the Oyahio 
region in waters of oceanic depth, its close 
proximity to the coast would render the exercise 
principally a coastal–open ocean comparison, 
while the exciting questions seemed to center 
more around the effects of different levels of iron 
supply on western versus eastern oceanic 
ecosystems.  Based on this, the group made the 
following comparisons between the western and 
eastern subarctic gyre ecosystems (henceforth 
WSG and ESG, respectively): 
 
Commonalities 
 
• Animals (particularly the large copepod 
species);  
• Annual primary productivity is about the 
same. 
Differences 
 
• Standing stock of chl is higher in the WSG; 
• Diatoms are dominant (sometimes? often?) in 
the WSG and very low in the ESG; 
• N. cristatus is dominant in the west vs.  
N. plumchrus in the east; N. cristatus prefers   
larger food particles compared to N. 
plumchrus; 
• There is greater copepod standing stock in the 
west vs. the east (in spring only? year-round?); 
• There are likely differences in amount, form, 
and timing of iron delivery. 
 
Identifying the large-scale, unifying questions  
 
The group discussed the potential temporal 
interactions between the microbial community 
‘limit cycles’ (5- to 10-day oscillations in 
chlorophyll biomass and, inversely, in ammonium 
concentration) and the ontogenetic vertical 
migration (weeks to months at the sea surface) of 
the dominant copepod species.  Potential 
interactions betweeen the two communities were 
pointed out, including: 
 
• Top-down effects on the entire microbial 
community of Neocalanus grazing on (large) 
microzooplankton; 
• Daily and seasonal changes in iron availability 
(from regeneration by micrograzers, as well as 
external inputs) and implications for copepod 
production. 
 
Our historical understanding of the role of 
Neocalanus in the open subarctic (particularly the 
ESG) ecosystem has shifted – the following 
pendulum model (Fig. 29) was proposed.

Questions 
 
• Do we fully understand the lack of a spring 
bloom in the ESG? 
• Does the large influx of spring copepods 
change the dynamics of the lower trophic 
levels?  (The mental experiment of placing a 
net at 400 m in late winter to trap all the 
upmigrating copepods was proposed – would 
this matter for spring lower trophic level 
dynamics in surface waters?) 
• How much of the primary production ends up 
in copepods? 
• How much, and over what time scales, does 
the composition of the phytoplankton 
community change? 
• Do east–west differences in the frequency of 
iron inputs affect the cycling within the 
microbial community? 
• Does the dominance of diatoms in the WSG 
affect Neocalanus feeding and trophic 
cascade? 
Needs as we move toward a proposal 
 
• Better documentation of limit cycles from 
existing data in the ESG; 
• Estimates of the amount and efficiency of 
primary production transfer to copepods (which 
could be estimated using inverse methods, e.g., 
based on measured copepod production and 
assumed growth efficiencies); 
• Estimates of the potential copepod community 
grazing impact on microzooplankton. 
 
Hypotheses 
 
Paradigm I   
 
Iron supply controls mesozooplankton biomass 
and species composition in the subarctic Pacific. 
 
• Hypothesis A:  Variation in iron inputs leads 
to the dominance of diatoms in the WSG as 
compared to the ESG. 
Major Grazer Hypothesis: 
Neocalanus spp. control 
spring phytoplankton blooms 
through direct grazing on 
phytoplankton 
(Heinrich, Early SUPER). 
New Idea: 
Neocalanus grazing has 
been historically under-
estimated (bottle effects), 
and are important in trophic 
cascades via feeding on 
large microzooplankton. 
‘No Influence’ Era: 
Neocalanus have little to no 
grazing impact and can 
barely survive in the ESG 
(late SUPER, Canadian 
JGOFS). 
 
   
83
• Hypothesis B:  The large diatom component in 
the WSG provides a more direct trophic 
linkage between autotrophic production and 
mesozooplankton consumers. 
• Hypothesis C:  Phytoplankton productivity 
and growth rates vary over different time 
scales in the west vs. the east. 
• Hypotheis D:  Mean diatom production per 
day is greater in the west than in the east. 
 
Paradigm II  
 
Differing mesozooplankton biomass and species 
composition in the east vs. west exert differing 
effects (via trophic cascade) on the microbial 
community.
 
   
 
 
 
 
   
85
C. MESOZOOPLANKTON STUDIES 
 
Participants:  Michael Dagg, Tsutomu Ikeda, Toru Kobari, Charles B. Miller and Atsushi 
Yamaguchi 
 
 
The primary questions regarding mesozooplankton 
approachable through the OECOS, comparative, 
spring time series concern the array of interzonally 
migrating (IZM) copepods (Neocalanus 
plumchrus, N. flemingeri and Eucalanus bungii; 
there is also a significant oceanic stock of Metridia 
pacifica) that is found all across the subarctic 
Pacific, species common to both the Oyashio 
region and the Gulf of Alaska.  The term 
‘interzonal migration’ refers to the fact that the 
first four species listed above all have long 
diapause phases from late spring to late winter, 
which are spent at depths below 500 meters.  
Except for E. bungii, they all spawn at great depth, 
producing eggs strictly from stored nutriment.  
The eggs and nauplii are oil-rich and rise toward 
the surface.  The season at which all of these 
copepods actively develop in the euphotic zone is 
spring.  In the west they grow through copepodite 
stages and through a nutriment storage phase 
during significant, to intense, phytoplankton 
blooms.  In the Gulf of Alaska this growth and 
storage occurs despite the absence of blooms, but 
during a time when phytoplankton production 
rates rise sharply, to produce a ‘spring transition’.   
 
If the western OECOS study site is appropriately 
chosen, western IZM will have copious stocks of 
large phytoplankton available as food during a 
substantial spring bloom, and microzooplankton 
will also be available as a dietary component.  In 
contrast, a site such as Station P (50°N, 145°W) in 
the east, will not have significant amounts of large 
phytoplankton, and past work has shown that   
(1) microzooplankton are nearly their entire diet 
and (2) development and certainly growth are very 
slow relative to stocks in enclosed coastal waters 
with spring blooms, specifically in the Strait of 
Georgia, British Columbia.   
 
Oceanic sectors of the subarctic Pacific support 
much greater stocks of mesozooplankton in spring 
compared to oligotrophic areas in subtropical and 
tropical waters.  These stocks build up through the 
spring transition, which cannot occur (especially 
in the east) without having significant effects on 
the food web of nano- and microplankton that 
provides them the nutrition for growth.  
Preliminary experiments and logic both suggest 
that consumption of microzooplankton by IZM 
(and other larger plankton) initiates a trophic 
cascade, which releases nanophytoplankton from 
grazing pressure.  Variation in this effect is likely 
part of the dynamics of the week-to-week 
variability of phytoplankton in the region.  Such 
cascades are amenable to observational and 
experimental evaluation. 
 
Hypothesis I 
 
IZM species common to both ends of the subarctic 
belt will differ in size-at-stage, feeding rates and 
growth.  Eastern stocks should have less food, 
grow and develop more slowly, and reach smaller 
final sizes.  Western stocks should grow faster and 
larger thanks to greater food availability. 
 
Goal 
 
We propose to evaluate the responses of growth 
and development to the difference in spring 
transition processes between eastern and western 
sides of the subarctic Pacific.  This should amount 
to a comparison between food-limited and food-
replete habitats, respectively. 
 
Approaches advocated at the workshop (others 
may be finally adopted)  
 
We propose to compare sizes of IZM copepods 
between western and eastern sectors of the 
subarctic Pacific.  Much of this can be done before 
the OECOS time-series study, and a literature 
review (Kobari, unpublished) has already been 
prepared.  Samples can be exchanged for 
evaluation of prosome lengths and body weights.  
While OECOS is planned for very intensive time 
series in just one spring on each side of the region, 
 
   
86
it will be necessary to take account of the 
interannual variability in size of IZM copepods.  
That variation is known to be significant (Miller et 
al., 1992), amounting to a 10% range variation in 
mean prosome length, but much less than the 
differences across the range. 
 
We will compare development rates, actually stage 
durations, between west and east, and develop 
Heinle graphs for all IZM species on both sides of 
the ocean.  Stage proportions in two or more 
mixed-layer samples per day for ~50 days will be 
evaluated.  To some extent we will employ 
adaptive analysis, counting only as many samples 
as necessary to obtain statistically robust stage 
durations. 
 
Sizes and weights of stages will be compared 
using frozen specimens:  the Western Group will 
videograph, then freeze, groups of single 
individuals in multiwell plates.  In the laboratory 
specimens will be weighed, freeze-dried, weighed 
again, lipids extracted and weighed again.  The 
Eastern Group is more concerned with coming off 
the ship with data, rather than frozen specimens.  
They propose to videograph specimens, blot them, 
and determine carbon and nitrogen contents with 
on-board carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen (CHN) 
equipment.  Sufficient comparative data can be 
obtained by some CHN analyses of western 
specimens and by some weighing of eastern 
specimens.  It is expected that biomass will be a 
well behaved function of C and N content. 
 
Laboratory rearing will be done to characterize 
fully-fed growth and development.  Since Growth 
= f (nutrition, temperature), we must do all that is 
possible (whatever the methodological limitations) 
to evaluate rations of IZM copepods in both 
eastern and western regions during OECOS by 
examining: 
 
• gut pigment content, with the expectation that 
IZM copepods in the west will contain much 
more phytoplankton pigment than in the east; 
• gut contents via microscopy and scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM); 
• incubation studies of removals for 
phytoplankton and microzooplankton.  These 
can be done as ‘concentration’ experiments, a 
series of containers with progressively more 
copepods.  Recent work (Leising et al., 2005) 
has shown that selection and rejection of 
specific phytoplankton can be demonstrated in 
this way, as well as showing trophic cascade 
effects (increases of particular particles as a 
result of release from microzooplankton 
grazing pressure by copepod predation); 
• the possibly that there may be layers (‘thin 
layers’) of high phytoplankton or 
microzooplankton concentrations that are 
important to IZM copepod nutrition.  We can 
examine their importance to ingestion by 
incubations with concentrated natural 
particles. 
 
Hypothesis II  
 
The feeding IZM (and other mesozooplankton) 
serve to modulate the upper water column 
production cycle via a trophic cascade – important 
in the east in spring, but not important, at least 
during the spring, in the west.  We know that 
chlorophyll levels in the oceanic Gulf of Alaska 
vary between ~0.15 and ~0.6 μg l
–1
, and 
progressions between those limits are gradual on 
time scales of days.  Thus, phytoplankton must 
alternately increase and decrease.  Since they are 
small and eaten primarily by microzooplankton, 
periods of increase are likely also periods of low 
microzooplankton stocks, while periods of 
phytoplankton decrease are likely also periods of 
mesozooplankton increase.  Thus, feeding of IZM 
copepods (or other mesozooplankton) on 
microzooplankton could release the nano-
phytoplankton from grazing pressure, leading to 
increasing chlorophyll.  Nutrients at the onset of 
such an event, particularly ammonia, would be 
high from microheterotroph grazing in the prior 
phase, supporting the plant growth.  Exactly why 
the IZM copepods would ever release the 
microzooplankton from feeding pressure is 
unclear.  Turbulence from storms could disrupt 
distributions or search processes.  On the other 
hand, turbulence events could improve hunting 
success (as suggested by a large, relatively recent 
body of literature).

 Goals  
 
• To make observations during the time-series 
sampling of abundance cycles of 
microheterotrophs and their phase relation to 
phytoplankton variations; 
• To make comparisons of copepod diets 
between periods of higher and lower 
phytoplankton abundance;  
• To make experimental evaluations of trophic 
cascade effects. 
 
Approaches    
 
• Phytoplankton and microheterotroph stocks 
will be evaluated in time-series work 2 to 4 
times per day, perhaps more often.   
• Diet evaluation is considered under 
Hypothesis I, above.  Comparison of results 
between different phases of the chlorophyll 
variation could characterize the role of 
mesozooplankton in possible trophic cascades. 
• ‘Concentration’ experiments (a series from 0 
to many copepods per container) will focus 
mostly on Neocalanus spp. which are 
dominant in the upper and lower euphotic 
layers.  These would involve big containers 
(order 10 liters) with recurring measures of 
chlorophyll, counts of microzooplankton and 
particle evaluation by a method like Flo-Cam.  
Other mesozooplankton issues 
 
What are the ecological significances of the small 
copepod species (Oithona, Microcalanus, 
Pseudocalanus, and others) that are often 
extremely numerous?  No particular approaches 
were discussed; we simply raised the issue. 
 
Results from the SUPER studies of IZM copepods 
showed that they can be strongly partitioned 
vertically, with N. plumchrus and N. flemingeri in 
the layer above the seasonal thermocline (~35 m) 
and N. cristatus and E. bungii just beneath it.  We 
need to establish if this is a consistent pattern 
during the main period of copepodite development 
and biomass increase, and to know if this partition 
occurs on both sides of the Pacific, in food-limited 
and food-replete habitats.  It was proposed that 
densities of these copepods are high enough that 
good samples can be obtained with a vertically 
hauled, multiple plankton sampler.  Sampling rate 
might be 6 depth ranges, night vs. day, twice a 
week, which, over ~7 weeks would equal 168 
samples.  That is very many, suggesting ‘adaptive 
analysis’, that is, counting until the result is 
effectively certain, but not necessarily counting all 
samples collected.  Workers would be David 
Mackas and Moira Galbraith in the east, and 
Atsushi Yamaguchi and colleagues in the west.

IV. Issues Arising During the Workshop 
 
A. PHYTOPLANKTON STOCK VARIATIONS IN HNLC SYSTEMS AND 
TROPHIC CASCADES IN THE NANO AND MICRO REGIMES 
 
 
A key aim of OECOS work in the Gulf of Alaska 
will be a more complete understanding of short-
term variation in phytoplankton stocks (see  
Fig. 10), which Strom et al. (2000) considered 
unexplained.  A first requirement is to characterize 
these variations better than has been done to date.  
Strom et al. based their argument on a single  
4-week time series of chlorophyll estimates at  
6-hourly intervals, which seemed to show that 
roughly 8- to 10-day cycles, with amplitude 
between about 0.2 and 0.6 mg chl-a m
–3
, were 
likely typical.  That is not enough information to 
say that such variation is typical or to plan a very 
long, very expensive (in money and human effort) 
cruise.  There were some shorter time series of 
chlorophyll taken on SUPER cruises in the 1980s, 
and those will be examined.  Dr. Philip Boyd 
working at the Institute of Ocean Sciences, 
Canada, deployed some moorings at Station P in 
the Gulf of Alaska in the mid-1990s and has begun 
to provide us with long time series of fluorometer 
data taken from the moorings.  The first data set 
we have seen shows comparable amplitude of 
variation with very strong autocorrelation (clear 
progressions, not chaotic changes), but the periods 
are mostly longer, on the order of 3 weeks and 
more.  Both amplitude and period vary, and we 
need to see all of Dr. Boyd’s data to discover the 
patterns.  These data belong to him and are not 
published, so we do not show here even the part 
that we have seen. 
 
In any case, the variations in phytoplankton 
standing stock need to be explained.  Some of the 
variation at fixed (Eulerian) sites may be 
transferred past them by advection.  However, 
even if that is true, the variation must be mediated 
by physical–biological interactions and trophic 
interactions.  The need for revealing that ecology 
remains.  If spatial variation and advective shifting 
of patterns are important, their description will 
provide clues to processes.  Strom et al. (2000) 
suggested that iron limitation may occur at 
phytoplankton abundance peaks, which has been 
considered thoroughly in this worshop. 
 
Several of the essays in this report have invoked a 
possible hypothesis explaining phytoplankton 
stock cycling:  it could result from a trophic 
cascade because of (1) diet selection and (2) size-
limitations on particles eaten by the dominant 
large copepods, that is, they mostly do not eat the 
smallest phytoplankton.  These copepods are 
numerically abundant, even in the most 
oligotrophic, strongly HNLC regions of the 
subarctic Pacific.  At least in spring, their food 
selection and limited range of food sizes could 
drive a cascade at lower tropic levels.  Let us pick 
up the cycle at the (still hypothetical!) peak for 
microheterotrophs (MH).  The copepods graze 
down the ciliate and hetertrophic dinoflagellate 
stocks, eventually taking them to levels where 
copepod feeding is inefficient and slows.  At this 
same point, pico- and nanophytoplankton get a 
respite from grazing, since switching by the 
copepods to feed upon them is, at most, weak.  
Therefore, the phytoplankton increase and 
ammonia is consumed.  As phytoplankton 
increase, the microzooplankton get better 
nutrition, increase and eventually reduce the 
phytoplankton, recycling nitrogen as ammonia.  
After an interval on short rations, the copepods 
again, have more microzooplankton to eat, and the 
cycle is back where we first looked at it.   Notice 
that this does not involve iron.  Iron does not need 
to limit pico- and nanophytoplankton for this cycle 
to operate; it only needs to stay low enough to 
inhibit maximal growth rates of micro-
phytoplankton.   
 
How could this be tested?  Perhaps a time series of 
feeding rates of copepods on MH could be 
constructed.  Some water would be collected, and 
then mixed with small (bacterial-scale) fluorescent 
food for ciliates.  A short time would be allowed 
to pass to get this signal into MH.  In that interval 
a mesozooplankton sample would be taken, and an 
approximately natural level of copepods from the 
 
   
90
tow would be added to the experiment.  They 
would be allowed time to eat but not to defecate; 
then they would be killed and evaluated for 
fluorescent gut contents using epifluorescent 
microscopy to count fluorescent masses in the gut 
right through the transparent body walls (at least 
this step works very well with Neocalanus spp.).  
When MH are high, ingestion should be high; 
when MH are low, ingestion should be low.  This 
is just a functional response evaluation, but if it 
tracks the fortnightly cycle, possibly offset from it 
such that high rates persist as MH decline, it 
would be consonant with the hypothesis.  
Suggestions are needed. 
 
 
B. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EAST AND WEST IN SITE SELECTION FOR 
OECOS TIME SERIES 
 
 
OECOS Workshop participants likely to 
contribute to a Gulf of Alaska time-series study 
were in close agreement that the most interesting 
potential in that region is well out to sea, well into 
the region that has been consistently HNLC in 
character since recurring studies began in the 
1950s.  Since most of the detailed work has been 
done at Station P (50°N, 145°W), that is a 
candidate site for the OECOS eastern station.  A 
location somewhat farther north, perhaps 52°N, 
would put the work closer to the top of the 
subarctic dome, the shallowest point along the 
subsurface isopleths of salinity and nutrients. 
 
The selection of an OECOS western station 
presents more problems.  In order to be at a site 
that has strong spring blooms every year, it would 
be necessary to be in the main flow of the Oyashio 
quite close to Hokkaido, perhaps at the frequently 
sampled Station H.  This has the additional 
attraction of being close to facilities in Hakodate, 
and thus would require minimal transit time to the 
station.  However, Station H, and areas close 
around it, are subject to large, advectively driven 
changes in conditions.  Warm core rings from the 
Kuroshio can wash across the area, which would 
completely change the character of the planktonic 
ecosystem.  Alternatively, the area is also subject 
to injections of very cold water emerging from the 
Sea of Okhotsk.  While some of the standard 
subarctic mesozooplankton would be present in 
this water, they would very likely be on 
completely different schedules from populations 
present at other times.  Thus, there would be a risk 
of chaotic data.   
 
At stations progressively farther to the northeast, 
say at 50°N, 158°E, there would be a chance that 
no bloom would be encountered, and that fully 
HNLC conditions would persist throughout the 
entire developmental season of IZM copepods.  
Thus, the comparisons of growth and development 
between food-replete (western) and food-limited 
(eastern) conditions could be lost.  In addition, 
stations well to the northeast involve very long 
transits, up to 10 days from Tokyo, for example, 
which would reduce the time on station 
dramatically.  These issues were not resolved at 
the workshop.  It is clear they must be left to 
discussions among OECOS participants in Asia.  
They know the territory and the aspects of 
scientific politics that would also be involved. 
 
 
C. TIMING OF OECOS EXPEDITIONS 
 
 
It is likely that differences between North 
American and Asian OECOS participants, in the 
requirements for obtaining funding and ship time, 
could force OECOS work in the west and east to 
be done in different years.  At the meeting, 
Japanese oceanographers felt that the best timing 
for OECOS western work would be an expedition 
in April–May 2007, and had reason to think ship 
time could be obtained for that year.  In the United 
States, oceanographers are facing serious shortfalls 
in ship funding, and major ship lay-ups are 
planned for 2006.  When those ships are brought 
 
   
91
back on-line in 2007, there will be long backlogs 
of work already funded and ahead of OECOS in 
the queue for a large vessel.  Moreover, the only 
likely scenario for funding also makes the earliest 
opportunity for work in the spring of 2008.  That 
scenario is a proposal that was submitted in early 
2006 and would be rejected the following summer 
(nothing here is funded at first request).  A second 
proposal with serious improvements is not 
possible before the deadlines of early 2007.  That 
proposal would not be reviewed by the spring of 
2007, making the spring of 2008 the almost certain 
earliest opportunity.  Therefore, the Eastern Group 
will try for an expedition in 2008. 
 
After some discussion, it was decided that working 
in different years is probably not a significant 
drawback for the comparison of eastern and 
western OECOS data sets.  Year-to-year variations 
of weather and ocean conditions affect the two 
regions differently, and the advective transfer of 
water (and plankton stocks, etc.) along the west-
wind drift takes several years.  Moreover, work in 
separate years will have some advantages.  
• It is possible that we can arrange some 
exchange of scientists between Eastern and 
Western Groups for participation in both 
cruises.  It is obvious that participation of 
North American scientists on a Japanese 
cruise would pose language problems, 
particularly for communication with the ship’s 
crew.  That is less likely a problem for 
Japanese scientists participating in the eastern 
expedition, since they all have reasonably 
strong skills in English.  Careful consideration 
of cultural differences in scientific operations 
at sea should be included in evaluating this 
possibility.  
 
•  Difficulties with methods encountered by the 
Western OECOS Group in the first cruise 
could possibly be worked out for the eastern 
cruise a year later.  It will be better to have 
failure-proof methods throughout, but 
contingencies always affect oceanographic 
work. 
 
 
 
D. CHARACTERIZATION OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY 
 
Comments from the Japanese participants after the 
OECOS Workshop show that most of them feel a 
strong need for physical oceanographers to 
participate in their work.  They will be considering 
exactly what physics (mixing, advection, 
microstructure) needs to be evaluated in the 
western gyre and will be seeking appropriate 
workers among their colleagues.  Work in the 
oceanic eastern sector will include solid and 
recurring physical characterization of the time-
series site, and many of the OECOS biological 
workers, particularly Drs. Strutton and Cowles, 
have extended experience in interpreting physical 
data.  If a SeaSoar spatial characterization of a 
large area around the time-series station is to be 
included, that work will surely entail a separate 
proposal from physical oceanographers not yet 
included in OECOS discussions.

V. Concluding Remarks  
 
The contents of this report do not include a 
detailed plan for what will eventually be proposed 
for time-series oceanographic observations during 
the spring transition in western and eastern sectors 
of the subarctic Pacific.  In fact, we did not 
develop such plans at the Workshop; just 
exchanging views on the character of the scientific 
questions to be addressed occupied all of the time.   
 
This report is simply a compendium of 
information exchanged.  Even as such, it leaves 
out much that was included in the talks (and 
PowerPoint presentations) given at the Workshop.  
For both Western and Eastern Working Groups, 
much remains to be achieved regarding choice of 
observations, station selection, basic modes of 
station keeping (drifter following vs. fixed 
stations) and logistics.  There are even open issues 
regarding the character of ecological phenomena 
to be studied and regarding what questions will be 
addressed.  All of this implies that much work lies 
ahead to make OECOS as useful as possible, and 
to justify what will be substantial costs.
