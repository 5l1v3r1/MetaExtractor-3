Foreword 
 
The recent publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report (AR4) 
concludes that there is a growing body of evidence that indicates climatic conditions are likely to change due to 
natural and anthropogenic forcing.  In response to these findings the PICES scientific community initiated a series of 
meetings to: 
a ) discuss frameworks and methodologies for forecasting the impacts of climate change on the growth, 
distribution and abundance of marine life, with particular emphasis on commercial fish and shellfish; 
b ) review the results of designated case studies to test methods; 
c ) plan for an inter-sessional meeting in early 2010 where scientists can present, discuss and publish 
forecasts of climate change impacts on the world’s commercial fish and shellfish resources. 
 
The research done within PICES on climate change and fisheries has been diverse and has included:  
• guidance on  methods for selection of  IPCC scenarios for use in projections,  
• guidance on techniques for downscaling IPCC scenarios to local regions,  
• development of coupled ecosystem models for use in evaluating climate-induced shifts in 
environmental conditions,  
• numerous publications documenting  relationships between climate forcing and marine fish and 
shellfish distribution and production, and  
• stock assessment techniques for evaluating management strategies to mitigate the impacts of change.  
 
A challenge facing PICES is the need to integrate this research to provide stakeholders with quantitative 
estimates of the potential impact of climate change on marine life in the North Pacific.  This challenge calls for 
the establishment of interdisciplinary research teams composed of experts from around the Pacific Rim who 
will focus attention on the development of common and standardized frameworks for forecasting climate 
change impacts on marine life, with particular emphasis on commercially important fish and shellfish.  The 
Science Plan for the new PICES scientific program, FUTURE (Forecasting and Understanding Trends, 
Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems), also highlights the need for integrated 
interdisciplinary research on the potential implications of climate change on marine ecosystems.  PICES 
should act now to ensure that our research communities develop the capability to provide quantitative 
contributions to the next IPCC reports and guidance for management under climate change scenarios.  PICES 
should strive to present and discuss results of the forecasting teams at an inter-sessional meeting, and papers 
should be published in a peer reviewed journal by 2011.  The timing for the publication is critical because the 
future IPCC AR5 report is slated for release in 2013, and only published papers can be referenced in that 
report.

Background 
 
The North Pacific Marine Science Organization 
(PICES) and the North Pacific Research Board 
(NPRB) co-sponsored a workshop on Forecasting 
Climate Impacts on Future Production of 
Commercially Exploited Fish and Shellfish on July 
19–20, 2007, in Seattle, U.S.A.  The workshop 
provided a forum for 38 participants from six 
countries (Appendix 1.1), including a significant 
number with expertise on the effects of climate on 
North Pacific fisheries and representatives from 
PICES’ Biological Oceanography, Fishery Science, 
and Physical Oceanography and Climate Committees 
(BIO, FIS, and POC) and Climate Forcing and 
Marine Ecosystem Response (CFAME) Task Team 
of the Climate Change and Carrying Capacity 
Program (CCCC). This workshop was a follow-up to 
an earlier workshop on Linking Climate to Trends in 
Productivity of Key Commercial Species in the Sub-
arctic Pacific that was held October 13–14, 2006, at 
the PICES Fifteenth Annual Meeting in Yokohama, 
Japan.  The goal of the endeavour was to develop a 
coordinated international effort to provide 
quantitative estimates of the impacts of climate 
change on major fish populations. Workshop 
 
participants representing each of the PICES member 
countries agreed that they would be interested in 
participating in this effort.  One outcome of the 
workshop was a concept for a PICES Panel on 
Fisheries and Climate Change (PPFCC) to continue 
this work. 
 
Participants discussed how these forecasting 
activities might differ from other national or 
international research programs that are focused on 
climate change impacts.  In summary, they will 
complement several ongoing research activities 
within the PICES region and the sub-arctic as a 
whole, and several features of the concept make it 
unique.  First, it will provide quantitative estimates 
of the impacts of climate change on fisheries in the 
North Pacific.  Second, it will produce a coordinated 
interdisciplinary and multi-national effort involving 
the application of similar methods and forecasting 
approaches to compare responses of fish and 
shellfish species across their ranges.  Third, it will 
focus on species of significant commercial interest 
and not on entire ecosystem responses.  Forecasting 
tools will be developed to allow the inclusion of 
environmental impacts on fish and shellfish 
production, distribution and growth.

Results of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) 
will be used to develop scenarios of regional 
oceanographic changes that will, in turn, be linked to 
changes in ocean forcing of upper trophic level 
species (see discussion below).  This builds on a 
history of research on mechanisms underlying 
fisheries production, setting the stage for the 
development of quantitative climate change impacts 
on fisheries.  Participants at the workshop recognized 
the importance of ocean and climate effects on 
recruitment and accepted the concept of decadal-
scale variation – a very important advancement and 
key result of the workshop. 
 
Links to Other Programs 
 
FIS-sponsored activities like the proposed PPFCC 
could provide a critical link to other national and 
international research programs that are expected to 
be active within the region during the next decade 
(Fig. 1.1).  These would build on the work of the 
IPCC that has provided scenarios for modelling 
climate change impacts on fisheries.  Examples of 
bio-physical models that are being developed by 
national programs include the U.S. National Science 
Foundation’s Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST), 
the U.S. Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics 
Program (GLOBEC) Northeast Pacific Program 
(NEP), and the U.S. North Pacific Climate Regimes 
and Ecosystem Productivity (NPCREP) program as 
well as international programs such as GLOBEC 
International.  PICES scientists can coordinate their 
activities with on-going research on upper trophic 
level responses to environmental forcing that are 
taking place in most national research institutions.  In 
particular, the results will be first-order forecasts for 
use in developing more complex, process-oriented 
studies that seek to predict the responses of whole 
ecosystems such as is being attempted in the NPRB-
funded Bering Sea Integrated Ecosystem Research 
Program (BSIERP) and the U.S. National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) Loss 
of Sea Ice (LOSI) program.  
 
The regional forecasting approach can be used to 
guide comparative research across the northern 
hemisphere, some of which is sponsored by 
GLOBEC’s Ecosystem Study of Sub-Arctic Seas 
(ESSAS), and by the U.S. Comparative Analysis of 
Marine Ecosystem Organization (CAMEO) program. 
The goals of this initiative are consistent with the 
climate forecasting element of the proposed PICES 
science program, FUTURE (Forecasting and 
Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of 
North Pacific Ecosystems), and the U.S. Fisheries 
and the Environment (FATE) program. 
 
The results of the coordinated research effort can be 
used by a wide range of individuals who are 
normally outside of the research community. 
Stakeholders who rely on fish and shellfish resources 
are expected to use the results to anticipate changes 
that may affect their businesses and communities. 
Fisheries managers will utilize the forecasts to 
evaluate whether actions are needed to sustain 
fisheries in their regions.  Conservation groups will 
be interested in order to better understand the 
regional and species-specific risks and challenges 
that climate change poses for species of interest. 
 
Forecasts developed through this effort will help to 
identify research gaps that could be the focus of 
interdisciplinary research programs involving field 
work.  Just as the recognition of regime shifts was 
used to promote the development of large national 
and international interdisciplinary research programs, 
participants at the workshop thought that the 
international research effort to investigate the 
impacts of climate change on marine fish populations 
may promote the expansion of national and 
international research programs on climate change 
and marine ecosystems. 
 
Workshop Format 
 
The workshop provided a forum for discussion of 
four components needed to complete the forecasts in 
a timely and coordinated fashion, including: IPCC 
scenarios, predictions of oceanographic impacts, 
modeling approaches, and scenarios for natural 
resource use and enhancement.  The key outcomes of 
these discussions are included in this report. 
 
Session I.  Status of climate change scenarios in 
the PICES region 
 
Drs. James Overland (U.S.A.) and Vladimir Kattsov 
(Russia) reported on the IPCC climate change 
scenarios arising from the 4th Assessment Report.  A 
major conclusion from Session I was that most 
model projections involve large natural variability 
(including decadal variability) as well as persistent 
trends from anthropogenic climate change.  These 
effects are expected to include persistent trends, 
shifts in the timing of seasonal events, such as the 
 
5
spring transition, and an increased frequency of 
extreme events, such as the number of warm or cold 
days.  From a spatial perspective, models differ 
markedly in the intensity of change across the North 
Pacific and its adjacent seas.  Session leaders noted 
that the major challenge facing climatologists is to 
assess whether models give a reasonable 
representation of the large-scale response of the 
Pacific to anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol 
emissions, relative to natural variability. Some 
progress on this issue was anticipated by the 
POC/CFAME workshop that was held during the 
PICES 2007 Annual Meeting, where climatologists 
were encouraged to exchange ideas on techniques to 
link the IPCC climate change scenarios with 
oceanographic change scenarios of the North Pacific. 
Session II.  What are the expected impacts of 
climate change on regional oceanography and 
what are some scenarios for these drivers for 
the next 10 years? 
 
Dr. Nathan Mantua (U.S.A.), who led the discussion 
for this session, noted that the IPCC scenarios exhibit 
a wide range of possible outcomes (Fig. 1.2) 
associated with different assumptions regarding 
emissions build-up and climate sensitivity to a given 
change in emissions (geophysics).  The oceanographic 
response to climate change is also uncertain and can 
give potentially conflicting results (Snyder et al., 
2003).  It was also recognized that trends in ocean 
conditions at the regional scale may not be easy to 
detect in the next few decades because shorter-term 
variations can mask them.  The group discussed the 
possibility that different techniques may be needed to 
forecast ocean responses over the near-term period of 
0–10 years and the longer-term period of 10–30 years.  
Participants were reminded that the PPFCC effort is 
challenging because operational climate forecasts at 
lead times greater than one year are simply not 
available at this time.  In the U.S., only a few major 
centers routinely offer climate forecasts, and these 
centers (NCEP/CPC, IRI, ECMWF, etc.) only project 
climate conditions from one to four seasons into the 
future.  There have been a handful of research studies 
that highlight the potential for making skillful multi-
year forecasts for aspects of Pacific climate, most 
notably predictions for sea surface temperature (SST) 
variations in the Kuroshio Extension region 
(Schneider and Miller, 2001; Seager et al., 2001).  
 
Dr. Nicholas Bond (U.S.A.) provided an example of 
how an IPCC scenario can be tied to a quantitative 
scenario for rock sole production in the Bering Sea. 
He used IPCC scenarios to estimate cross-shelf 
transport in the Bering Sea, and described how this 
index could be incorporated into a spawner-recruit 
relationship for rock sole to predict future run 
strength of this species in the Bering Sea. 
 
The major recommendations from this session were 
as follows: 
• Oceanographers and climatologists need to be 
encouraged to exchange ideas on techniques for 
evaluating oceanographic responses to climate 
change. 
• Oceanographers need to be made aware of 
detailed information on physical or bio-physical 
drivers that can be used to make projections of 
future fish distribution or production, 
particularly if there are critical environmental 
thresholds that govern competition for prey, 
predation or advection to suitable habitats. 
• Fisheries biologists were encouraged to provide 
detailed information on the physical or bio-
physical drivers or environmental thresholds that 
are needed to make a projection by the 2007 
PICES Annual Meeting (e.g., Table 1.2). 
Session III.  Recruitment forecasting  
 
Dr. Richard Beamish (Canada) led the discussion 
during this session.  Several participants provided 
examples of the influence of climate on local 
oceanography and fish production.  Dr. Xianshi Jin 
(China) presented evidence that decadal changes in 
climate conditions may have influenced the 
fecundity of northern anchovy. He also demonstrated 
important regional differences in the production of 
small yellow croaker.  Time trends in the annual 
catch of small yellow croaker and largehead hairtail 
in the Yellow Sea show a marked increase in 
abundance since 2000.  Dr. Kazuaki Tadokoro 
(Japan) provided evidence that decadal shifts in the 
location of the transition between the Oyashio 
Current and the Kuroshio Current may influence the 
salinity and mixed layer depth which is strongly 
correlated to the production of the copepod 
Neocalanus plumchrus.  Dr. Vladimir Radchenko 
(Russia) presented some recent work by  
Dr. Gennady Kantakov (Sakhalin Research Institute 
of Fisheries and Oceanography) which showed how 
climate linkages influence circulation patterns in the 
Sea of Okhotsk.  The resulting changes may alter the 
distribution and survival of juvenile salmon in the 
region.  Ms. Teresa A’mar (U.S.A.) described a 
 
6 
technique for forecasting Gulf of Alaska walleye 
pollock.  Her projection incorporated environmental 
forcing on recruitment by modifying the mean age–1 
abundance with environmental factors that had been 
previously linked to recruitment. 
 
There was insufficient time for participants to deal 
with recruitment mechanisms for all species, but from 
the limited discussion it was clear that understanding 
of the mechanisms that affect recruitment ranges from 
poor to good.  Dr. Suam Kim (Korea) noted that 
retrospective studies have shown that environmental 
forcing accounts for a significant fraction of the 
variance in recruitment, and some improvement could 
be made by directed research on mechanisms.  
 
Participants were encouraged to examine the species 
 
listed in Table 1.1 to assess the current state of 
knowledge regarding mechanisms linking climate 
forcing and fish production, and the uncertainty 
associated with these mechanisms (see Table 1.2 for 
an example; however, requests for output by latitude, 
longitude, and month were preferred).  A few 
participants noted that some fraction of the 
recruitment of managed species may be random so 
there may be a threshold to predictability.  Different 
views were also expressed on what percentage of 
explained variability constitutes a “good” forecast. 
One useful exercise would be for scientists across the 
Pacific Rim to report on the amount of variance 
explained in existing studies in order to determine if 
there is a common level of random variance 
associated with models of environmental links to 
recruitment.

 Note that the IPCC did not make anthropogenic carbon emission forecasts. Instead, they developed a suite of future greenhouse 
gas and sulfate aerosol emissions scenarios, each of which is based on a story-line that includes scenarios for economic 
development, international cooperation, and technological change.  These are termed “scenarios” because it is accepted that the 
political, socio-economic, and technological factors required for making true “greenhouse gas emissions forecasts” are essentially 
unknowable.

Session IV.  What models are out there?  How 
is climate linked to the model?  
 
Dr. Michael Schirripa (U.S.A.) led this discussion 
and identified eight types of models: 
 
1. PICES North Pacific Ecosystem Model for 
Understanding Regional Oceanography 
(NEMURO): light intensity + SST; 
2. PICES NEMURO.FISH: Input from NEMURO; 
3. NOAA Fisheries SS2: Generalized framework; 
4. Single Species Management Strategy Evaluations; 
5. ATLANTIS: ROMS output, flow, SST, salinity; 
6. Ecopath-Ecosim; 
7. Multi-species forecasting models; 
8. Modularized models as building blocks. 
Dr. Yasuhiro Yamanaka (Japan) provided an 
overview of a collaborative research effort to couple 
a 3-D circulation model to NEMURO and a multi-
species model that includes interactions between 
anchovy, saury and sardine.  The sardine model 
includes migration estimated by an artificial network 
approach and a bio-energetic model to incorporate 
changes in growth of fish associated with local 
environmental conditions.   
 
Dr. Bernard Megrey (U.S.A.) discussed the 
international research effort to develop common 
software to couple fish bio-energetics to NEMURO 
(NEMURO.FISH).  Dr. Richard Methot (U.S.A.) 
provided examples where single species stock 
assessment models could be adapted to incorporate 
9 
environmental forcing on recruitment, growth, or 
distribution of fish.  This type of single species 
forecasting tool could be readily applied, and it was 
suggested that current forecasting tools could be 
shared among nations. 
 
Participants discussed the feasibility of utilizing 
NEMURO.FISH type models to develop forecasts. 
Japanese scientists reported that they have been 
working to embed bio-energetic models in regional 
climate–ocean models.  U.S. participants noted that a 
NEMURO model had been linked to a salmon bio-
energetics model to assess climate impacts on pink 
salmon in the sub-arctic Pacific.  They pointed out 
that BEST recently provided funding to develop 
similar models for the Bering Sea.  They also 
reported linking a Nutrient-Phytoplankton-
Zooplankton (NPZ) model to a climate–ocean model 
for the California Current system (CCS) which could 
be used to assess climate impacts on small pelagic 
fishes in the CCS and in the Asian region.  It was 
noted that the base model for the CCS is a 10-km 
grid model that may not adequately resolve coastal 
oceanography.  U.S. scientists also remarked that 
applications of the ATLANTIS model have been 
attempted in the CCS. ATLANTIS provides a 
spatially explicit consideration of the amount of 
production as a function of temperature or other 
physical variables.  In preparation for the October 
2007 workshop, scientists were asked to be prepared 
to report on the types of forecasting models that are 
available, by species, to allow for an analysis of the 
opportunities for comparisons across regions. 
 
It was recognized that for several species, proposed 
mechanisms underlying recruitment variability 
included measures of prey availability and the 
volume of suitable habitat.  For volumetric estimates 
of habitat suitability, NEMURO.FISH type models 
with imbedded climate–ocean models would be 
preferred; however, environmental proxies could be 
used to estimate prey volume. 
 
Participants discussed several techniques for using 
environmental proxies in forecasting models.  
Fisheries biologists were asked to create tables with 
detailed information on the required physical or 
biological variables (by latitude, longitude, and 
month) used to forecast processes underlying 
recruitment growth and distribution of fish stocks.  
This task was to be completed prior to the 2007 
PICES Annual Meeting in Victoria.  It was agreed 
that the tables would be distributed to oceano-
graphers as soon as they were finished. 
 
Session V.  Assumptions regarding future fishing 
scenarios and enhancement activities 
 
Dr. Anne Hollowed (U.S.A.) led this discussion. She 
acknowledged that developing scenarios to forecast 
future fishing mortality rates and impacts of marine 
enhancement activities will be important. The 
Management Strategy Evaluation modeling approach 
explicitly calls for this type of effort.  To stimulate 
discussion, members from each nation were asked 
their opinion on the:  
• future demand for fish and shellfish, 
• expected trends in management of marine resources, 
• future of fisheries enhancement activities, 
• implications of increased fuel prices on the choice 
of target species by fisheries. 
 
There was insufficient time for a thorough discussion 
of this issue.  However, the need for a serious 
treatment of these factors in models was highlighted. 
The following is a brief summary of the responses. 
 
Canada 
 
• A modest increase in demand is expected, driven 
mostly by world markets.  Eco-labelling is a new 
trend and poses a threat to the demand of some 
fisheries. 
• There will be a trend toward science that supports 
ecosystem-based management, objectives-based 
fishery management plans (more precautionary), 
new “ocean to plate” (economics, eco-labelling) 
initiative. 
• Substantial changes will take place for salmon 
management, including reduced commercial 
harvests by non-indigenous fishermen in most 
areas.  The remaining fisheries will shift to quota 
management. Fisheries are curtailed by the 
Species at Risk Act (SARA).  
• Hatcheries will not be expanding. However, there 
will be some expansion of ocean ranching, but not 
in large areas.  Fish farming in British Columbia 
will continue to expand, but probably slowly in 
the first 10 years. 
• No big changes in groundfish management are 
expected.  There will be some interest in 
groundfish fish farming and enhancement. SARA 
constrains some groundfish fisheries. 
 
10 
• Active shellfish mariculture and enhancement 
programs (e.g., geoduck, abalone) are taking place. 
• There is a need for more conservative catch quotas 
for Pacific hake in the U.S. (shared stock with 
Canada). 
 
China 
 
• The demand for seafood is expected to increase. 
• Aquaculture production has been higher than 
ocean capture fisheries, and it is likely that 
aquaculture programs will expand. 
• Fleet reduction (buy-back) programs will reduce 
the fishery effort and will provide fishermen 
training for alternative employment. 
• Enhancement programs have been used for more 
than 20 years to rebuild fish, shrimp, shellfish, 
and jellyfish populations.  These programs will 
continue or expand.  
• A ban on fishing during summer months, used to 
manage fisheries since 1995, will continue. 
 
Japan 
 
• There will be a decrease in demand (consumption 
per person) for seafood as diets shift to other meats, 
except that the demand for high-grade species, like 
tuna, is increasing. 
• No big changes in management are expected for 
the next 10 years. 
• Stock rebuilding for salmon is taking place, and 
hatcheries are releasing larvae of coastal fishes 
like flatfish, shellfish and others. 
• Fish farming is important, particularly in the 
northern part of Japan. 
 
Korea 
 
• Fisheries demand is increasing. 
• Rebuilding plans have been implemented for blue 
crab and some other species. 
• Salmon enhancement programs will be developed. 
• Managers will adopt a more precautionary approach 
to resources, including bycatch reduction. 
• The current open access to the fishery system may 
be replaced by a license limitation and quota 
system over the long term.  A new fishery 
management act may be passed by the government 
this year. 
 
Russia 
 
• Demand is growing. The Russian Far East exports 
to Japan and is exploring markets in Korea, China 
and other Asian countries.  A large increase in 
domestic demand could be realized if 
transportation systems are improved. 
• New fishery rules are established for all areas. 
There are some new restrictions on the crab 
fishery and some revision to the quota system. 
There is a plan to establish total allowable catches 
for all fished stocks.  Changes are likely, perhaps 
with a shift in focus to the most commercially 
important fisheries.  
• Enhancement programs for salmon are likely to 
continue or expand, with a focus on the Sakhalin–
Kuril Islands region where 24 new hatcheries will 
be built.  Enhancement is also done in some areas 
for clams and sea cucumbers.  
• Fuel is an issue for Russian fisheries. It constrains 
current fisheries to the Exclusive Economic Zone. 
• In the Russian Far East, oil and gas extraction on 
the shelf is being developed in the Sakhalin 
region.  Further development of oil and gas in the 
Kamtchatka region may cause conflicts in this 
important fishery region. 
 
U.S. Alaskan coast  
 
• Market demand for Alaskan fish and shellfish is 
likely to continue to increase in Alaska.  New 
markets for Arctic fish species may develop as 
access to new fishing grounds is improved by loss 
of sea ice.  
• Fisheries management strategies will continue to 
employ the precautionary approach and multi-
species management through target species and 
limit reference points.  New constraints associated 
with the adoption of these measures are designed 
to sustain non-target species. 
• Fish hatcheries are used for salmon in the Gulf of 
Alaska. It is unlikely that they will expand in 
Alaska in the near term.  However, in the long 
term this approach may be considered.  It is likely 
that efforts to rebuild Alaskan crab stocks will 
intensify in the next decade due to the combined 
interest of the fishing industry and the conservation 
community. 
• Increases in fuel prices will have a great impact 
on Alaskan fisheries where many fishing grounds 
are located in remote regions. 
• Several regions of the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands 
and Gulf of Alaska have already been set aside as 
marine protected areas or marine reserves.  The 
most recent action by the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council to close the northern regions 
11 
of the Bering Sea to commercial trawling is likely 
to curtail (but not prohibit) expansion to the north. 
  
 U.S. West Coast 
 
• International markets are increasing, so demand 
will be driven by markets in the Far East.  The 
demand for some products are increasing in 
China, but decreasing in Japan. Local markets are 
expected to increase. 
• Management changes are similar to Alaska 
because they are driven at the national level. 
• Fishing opportunities are constrained for rockfish 
owing to strict rebuilding plans.  Some overfished 
stocks may take 50 years to recover.  Bycatch will 
constrain future fisheries. 
• Enhancement will not be important, except for 
salmon. 
• Fuel and other considerations are similar to Alaska. 
• Incorporation of ecosystem-based management is 
increasing. 
• There is a national initiative to develop offshore 
aquaculture, but there is some resistance in 
certain areas, particularly Alaska.  It is uncertain 
if this will develop. 
 
Workshop participants agreed that temporal trends in 
anthropogenic activities should be included in the 
forecast.  At a minimum, this information should 
include scenarios regarding expected levels of 
fishing mortality.  Fisheries enhancement efforts are 
likely to expand, which may mask the impact of 
climate on survival during the early life history 
period.  The impact of fishery enhancement could be 
modeled by changing the expected mean recruitment, 
by changing the carrying capacity of the system, or 
both.  A useful suggestion was that each nation 
should prepare a document describing the future of 
fisheries management in 10–20 years. 
 
Session VI.  Where do we go from here? 
 
It was decided to continue with a multi-national 
interdisciplinary research team approach that 
includes representatives from each PICES member 
country, as well as a broad spectrum of experts in 
climatology, oceanography, fisheries biology and 
modeling.  For some nations, experts have to be 
identified to join the research effort.  Participants 
recognized the need for discussions within 
disciplines to resolve technical issues, and it was 
decided that some of these issues could be resolved 
through e-mail prior to the 2007 PICES Annual 
Meeting.  It was also noted that Asian scientists 
could discuss some of these issues at the 3rd 
Japan/China/Korea GLOBEC symposium scheduled 
for December 2007, in Hokkaido, Japan.   
 
The list of target species was reviewed and several 
were dropped from the list developed in October 
2006.  After careful deliberation, 28 species were 
selected for further consideration (Table 1.1). 
Participants also reviewed the regional partitions 
proposed in October 2006, but no change was 
recommended. 
 
Participants agreed to project implications of climate 
change at 10- and 30-year time horizons.  To ensure 
that the forthcoming PICES Scientific Report 
adequately represents the opinions of participants, 
each scientist was requested to write a short 
statement describing the feasibility of implementing 
a program like PPFCC and the feasibility of 
completing the forecasts within the next 2–3 years.

Background 
 
This report is a summary of the activities and results 
of a workshop (Phase 2) on Forecasting Climate 
Impacts on Future Production of Commercially 
Exploited Fish and Shellfish held on October 30, 
2007, in conjunction with the PICES Sixteenth 
Annual Meeting, in Victoria, Canada.  Twenty-two 
scientists attended the workshop (Appendix 2.1), 
including members of Ecosystem Studies of the Sub-
Arctic Seas (ESSAS), PICES’ Biological 
Oceanography, Fishery Science, and Physical 
Oceanography and Climate Committees (BIO, FIS, 
and POC), Working Group on Evaluations of 
Climate Change Projections (WG 20) and Climate 
Forcing and Marine Ecosystem Response (CFAME) 
Task Team of the Climate Change and Carrying 
Capacity Program (CCCC). Participants from all 
PICES member countries except China were present.  
The workshop provided an interdisciplinary forum 
for communication of the data needed to forecast 
climate change impacts on commercial fish species, 
discussion of candidate modeling approaches that 
could be applied to develop such forecasts, and the 
potential constraints associated with fulfilling these 
data needs and modeling efforts.

1. Oceanographers and climatologists should identify 
what techniques they recommend for forecasting 
oceanographic responses to climate change. 
2. Fisheries scientists should provide reports on the 
current state of knowledge regarding mechanisms 
linking climate forcing and fish production, and 
the uncertainty associated with these mechanisms. 
3. Fisheries scientists should identify what physical 
or bio-physical drivers or environmental 
thresholds would be needed to forecast future fish 
or shellfish production.  These requests should 
specify the location (latitude and longitude) and 
time period for the requested physical variable. 
 
Responses were discussed at the workshop and 
written summaries of these are included in this 
report.  The following is a summary of the key 
outcomes of discussion. 
 
Forecast Feasibility 
 
The presented reports revealed that hypotheses 
linking climate and fish production (or distribution) 
exist for the majority of commercially fished species 
that were identified previously as potential 
candidates for quantitative forecasts (Phase 1 
workshop report, this report).  Several participants 
commented that there is considerable uncertainty 
surrounding the proposed linkages between climate 
forcing and fish production or distribution.  
 
It was pointed out that a PICES interdisciplinary 
forecasting effort should include a decision analysis 
tool that could be used to communicate the 
uncertainty associated with our forecasts.  
Uncertainty in future climatic conditions could be 
provided using ensembles based on several IPCC 
scenarios.  Uncertainty associated with links to the 
population dynamics of selected species could be 
conveyed by developing forecasting tools that track 
true and perceived stock status where perceived 
stock status would incorporate measurement error 
and process errors associated with the assessment.  
Management Strategy Evaluations could be used to 
evaluate the performance of different harvest policies 
under changing environmental conditions. 
 
Format of Information  
 
The workshop provided an opportunity for 
information exchange between members of WG 20 
and fisheries biologists.  Participants concluded that 
requests for data/information/model output should be 
compiled in spreadsheet format and accompanied by 
written descriptions of the rationale for the requested 
information.  This combination of tabular and written 
formats is expected to improve communication 
 
20 
between the two groups and would allow the 
climatologists and oceanographers to assess the 
workload associated with downscaling IPCC models 
to regional scales of interest. 
   
Modeling Approaches 
 
Participants discussed the modeling approach that 
they planned to use to develop the forecast.  Three 
general approaches were identified: coupled bio-
physical models, stock assessment projection 
models, and comparative approaches. 
 
Coupled bio-physical models 
 
Japanese scientists are planning to downscale IPCC 
model output to force regional circulation models 
with ensembles of future climate scenarios.  They are 
exploring the possibility of modifying 
NEMURO.FISH type models for use in forecasting 
the response of small pelagic species to climate 
change.  They are also planning to evaluate model 
performance by making a reconstruction of past 
oceanographic events and comparison of observed 
and predicted estimates of the distribution and 
abundance of target species.  Scientists in the 
California Current region are coupling population 
dynamic models to ATLANTIS.  
 
Dr. Clarence Pautzke announced that the North 
Pacific Research Board (NPRB) had funded a major 
research effort as part of NPRB’s Bering Sea 
Integrated Ecosystem Research Program (BSIERP; 
www.nprb.org).  The Program will support the 
development of several models for use in forecasting 
climate impacts on walleye pollock in the eastern 
Bering Sea.  Some elements of the BSIERP 
modeling approach expand on the NEMURO.FISH 
type modeling by including fish behavior and 
complex feedback behavior between all trophic 
levels.   
 
Stock assessment projection models 
 
Scientists from several PICES nations plan to use ocean 
conditions from regional ocean models forced with 
IPCC climate change scenarios.  Time trends in ocean 
conditions will be incorporated into population 
dynamics models for selected commercial species. 
Forecast models that track observed and perceived 
stock status will be used to assess the impacts of 
climate and fishing on the status of commercial species.   
 
Comparative approaches 
 
PICES and ICES have previously sponsored 
symposia on ecosystem comparisons.  These 
comparisons have identified differences in the 
structure, organization and energy flow of marine 
ecosystems.  Knowledge of similarities and 
differences between systems may be helpful in 
predicting responses of marine fish to climate 
change.  Participants at the workshop agreed that the 
comparative approach could also be applied to the 
study of climate change impacts on commercially 
exploited marine species.   
 
Although coupled bio-physical models and stock 
assessment projection models differ in terms of 
spatial and temporal complexity, the coupled bio-
physical modeling approach has the distinct 
advantage of tracing complex interactions within the 
system.  The stock assessment forecasting approach 
tracks the results of climate change using time trends 
in system forcing at population scales, based on 
proposed mechanisms linking population dynamics 
to ocean conditions.  While less complex in terms of 
feedbacks, this approach provides statistical 
performance metrics that track sources of uncertainty 
associated with forecasting population dynamics.  
 
Similarities in Data Requests 
 
Common among the requests for bio-physical 
information were: sea surface temperature (SST), 
bottom temperatures (BT), seasonal advection 
(direction and intensity), timing of production 
(including spring blooms), stratification and 
upwelling events, zooplankton community structure, 
and time trends in the spatial overlap of habitats of 
predators and prey (Table 2.1).  The marked 
similarity is encouraging because it implies that a 
common suite of core drivers influences production 
of commercial species.  While regional features of 
North Pacific shelf regions may act to influence 
production of marine fish and shellfish, the 
commonality of drivers suggests that application of 
the comparative approach may provide insight as to 
how species will respond to climate change.  This 
confirms the importance of moving forward with a 
coordinated international effort to develop a forecast 
of climate forcing on commercial species. 
 
Given the similarity in the drivers identified for each 
region, workshop participants discussed the 
 
21 
possibility that physical oceanographers and 
climatologists might coordinate their efforts to 
provide regional nodes where fisheries biologists 
could submit requests.  Drs. James Overland and 
Muyin Wang offered to serve as the regional node 
for the eastern Pacific.  A regional node for the 
western Pacific should be identified. 
 
Opportunities for Coordination with Other 
PICES Groups and International Efforts 
 
Representatives of CFAME and WG 20 attended the 
workshop and reported that both CFAME and  
WG 20 plan to attempt forecasting climate change 
impacts on small pelagic species in the California 
Current System, Kuroshio/Oyashio Current System, 
and Yellow Sea/East China Sea region.  After the 
meeting it was noted that scientists at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography, UCSD, and the 
Southwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA, had 
received funding for a project titled “Using ocean 
data assimilation to incorporate environmental 
variability into sardine and squid assessments.”  It is 
anticipated that this project will provide important 
contributions to the PICES forecasting effort. 
 
The workshop organizers planned to attend the 
ICES/PICES/IOC Symposium on Climate Change in 
the World’s Oceans in Gijón, Spain, from May 19–
23, 2008 and to hold a workshop during the 
symposium to promote communication with other 
programs.   
 
After the Phase 2 workshop, it was found that there 
were several international programs that have goals 
which are similar to the PICES/FIS forecasting 
effort.  A schedule for production of a coordinated 
international forecasting effort was discussed by the 
workshop participants with the following proposed 
timelines: 
 
March 2008 Physical oceanographers and climatologists to identify regional nodes for submission of 
data requests 
April–May 2008 Oceanographers and climatologists from each regional node to review requests and 
discuss the feasibility of extracting the requested data with fisheries biologists 
April 2008 PICES inter-sessional CFAME/WG 20 workshop in Honolulu, U.S.A. 
May 2008 ICES/PICES/IOC symposium in Gjión, Spain. Discussion of PICES/FIS forecasting 
approach with QUEST – Fish and other representatives of international programs 
June–September 2008 Preliminary forecasts for selected species 
October 2008 Joint meeting with WG 20 to discuss preliminary forecasts 
October–June 2009 Development of written reports for PICES’ North Pacific Ecosystem Status Report

Relatively few mechanistic hypotheses regarding 
groundfish production (recruitment) have been 
proposed and rigorously tested for individual species 
on the U.S. west coast.  The most compelling 
 
hypotheses for environmental effects occur at early 
life stages, and as year-class strength is determined 
in the first year, processes acting on recruitment are 
of highest priority.  This short paper attempts to outline 
   
Table 2.2  Summary of proposed processes forcing groundfish recruitment.

the processes which may influence groundfish 
recruitment, the physical variables which may be 
indicative of the processes and conditions in the 
California Current, and the time and spatial scales at 
which they occur.  Important processes, variables, 
and their time and spatial scales will vary by species, 
but some similarities across groups of species may 
emerge.   
 
This paper is primarily a synthesis of workshops and 
discussions from a project on incorporating climate 
information into rebuilding analyses for overfished 
rockfish led by Drs. Carrie Holt (University of 
Washington), Andre Punt (University of 
Washington), and Nathan Mantua (University of 
Washington) with participation from Elizabeth 
Clarke (NOAA), Richard Methot (NOAA), Ed 
Armstrong (NASA), Ben Holt (NASA), Yi Chao 
(NASA), Nick Tolimieri (NOAA), Ian Stewart 
(NOAA), and Melissa Haltuch (NOAA).  Table 2.2 
proposes the process which may be forcing 
recruitment, variables which might be used to 
describe the process, and the time and spatial scales 
of likely importance. 
 
Results from Carrie Holt’s work on identifying dates 
of spring transition and the relationship between 
spring transition and west coast groundfish 
 
recruitment can be summarized as follows: 
• Caution is advised when interpreting results of 
studies that relate dates of spring transition to 
biological variables due to uncertainty in defining 
those dates.  For example, three methods 
examined for identifying the timing of spring 
transition pertain to seasonal shifts in different 
features of ocean conditions.  It is unclear which 
metric best reflects conditions important for 
groundfish recruitment. 
• Identifying dates of spring transition that are 
appropriate for both northern and southern regions 
of the California Current has proven difficult. 
• Modeling results to date have found statistically 
significant negative relationships between dates 
of spring transition and recruitment deviations for 
U.S. west coast groundfish for only a few 
northern species that spawn in winter offshore 
and rear nearshore.  
 
This summary is meant to provide a basis for further 
discussion of mechanistic hypotheses and the 
physical data that are available from IPCC climate 
models which might be used to forecast fish 
production as part of the PICES project on 
“Forecasting climate impacts on future production of 
commercially exploited fish and shellfish”, should a 
hypothesis stand up to testing.

Changes in sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) recruitment in relation to 
oceanographic conditions

Sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) range from the 
southern west coast of the United States, north to 
Alaska, the Bering Sea, and west to Japan.  The 
species supports substantial fisheries in both the 
eastern and western Pacific Ocean.  Juvenile 
recruitment along the west coast of the continental 
United States has been highly variable over the past 
three decades.  Examining the estimates of spawning 
stock biomass from extensive surveys made over this 
same period point to the fact that factors external to 
the sablefish population dynamics have significant 
effects on population level recruitment.  Using a 
General Additive Model (GAM), it was demonstrated 
that there are physical oceanographic variables that 
significantly interact with sablefish recruitment. 
Significant relations were found between juvenile 
recruitment and northward Ekman transport, 
eastward Ekman transport, and sea level during key 
times and at key locations within the habitat of this 
species (Schirripa and Colbert, 2006).  The overall 
model explains nearly 70 percent of the variability in 
sablefish recruitment between the years 1974 and 
2000.  Bootstrapping techniques were applied to the 
parameter estimates, and the resulting distributions 
were found to support the modeling assumptions of 
normality.  Given the above model, it is possible to 
draw preliminary conclusions concerning year-class 
strength of cohorts, not yet available to the survey 
gear, as well as historic year-class strengths.  
 
We used data from Neah Bay and Toke Point, 
Washington, and Astoria and Newport, Oregon and 
averaged the monthly sea surface height (SSH) over 
April, May, and June to arrive at a coastal SSH 
between 44° and 50°N latitude. Data on annual 
zooplankton (copepod) anomalies were those reported 
in Mackas et al. (2006).  Total dry weights of northern 
and southern species of copepods from southern 
Vancouver Island were used as an index to deviations 
from the stock-recruitment curve (Fig. 2.1).  These 
anomalies are used to characterize the zooplankton 
species composition of the larval/juvenile sablefish 
habitat.

recruitment deviations from the fitted stock-recruit 
relation.  The method employed in this assessment 
treats the natural log of the z-score of the 
environmental data in the same manner as all other 
survey data and is used as a tuning index for 
recruitment deviations from the stock-recruit 
function.  The link between zooplankton and 
sablefish survival was first reported by McFarlane 
and Beamish (1992).  To determine if these indices 
could be used to track changes in sablefish survival, 
each was regressed against the recruitment 
deviations from the model that included none of the 
indices (Fig. 2.2).  While all three indices had highly 
significant (P < 0.05) relations to recruitment 
deviations, the most variation was explained by the 
SSH time series (P < 0.0001, R
2
 = 0.403). 
 
In late spring and early summer, young-of-year 
sablefish have developed from the larval stage, are 
free swimming and free feeding.  At this stage, they 
search for zooplankton and other food while moving 
onshore to the nursery grounds.  Low sea level and 
low values of the North Pacific Index suggest higher 
than expected recruitment.  The tide gauge sea level 
data we use are not adjusted for barometric pressure, 
so they integrate both the atmospheric effects and the 
large-scale ocean conditions.  That is, they integrate 
both the large-scale northeastern Pacific Ocean 
conditions with local upwelling and pressure.  Sea 
level is also a good predictor of near-bottom ocean 
temperature along the shelf.  Lower sea level is 
associated with colder than average water, more 
 
upwelling, stronger southward currents and lower 
salinity.  All these factors provide better habitat for 
young sablefish, as they occupy the shelf at this time 
of year.  The timing of the spring transition may be 
as critical as the SSH level itself.  That is, the 
contribution of the April SSH may have more of an 
influence on sablefish survival than the contributions 
from May and/or June.   
 
There is little doubt at this point that sablefish larval 
survival is modulated, at least in part, by climate and 
the manner in which climate affects the annual 
strength of the California Current System.  This was 
evident in 2005, a remarkable year off the West 
Coast (Kosro et al., 2006), when in spring and early 
summer, the northern California Current System was 
anomalously warm because the spring transition to a 
wind-driven upwelling was delayed by 2–3 months. 
This delay worked its way up the food chain and 
resulted in the zooplankton community off the West 
Coast being dominated by small, southern species of 
copepods, which are of relatively poor nutritional 
value.  It is this chain of events that presumably led 
to, among other things, poor sablefish recruitment in 
2005.  While one year does establish a theory such as 
this, the significant regressions on recruitment 
deviations and zooplankton anomalies are 
convincing in this regard; as goes the climate, so 
goes sablefish recruitment.  Furthermore, SSH was 
well above average for the month of April, an early 
indication that 2005 survival would be low.  In April 
2006, SSH was similar to that of April 2005 but 
eventually decreased to below average levels in May 
and June, indicating that the spring transition was 
late in 2006.  As a result, the 2006 year-class 
abundance may also be below average. This outcome 
should be evident in the 2007 shelf survey.  
 
While the significant relation between the SSH index 
and sablefish age-0 survival demonstrates that this 
should be a reliable (at least near term) index, the 
association with the zooplankton index may support 
the underlying biological mechanism for WHY this 
relationship exists.  Investigations of the food habits 
of age-0 fish, especially during the spring months, 
could help provide this understanding.  Also, further 
research should be conducted to evaluate alternative 
methods for incorporating ecosystem metrics into the 
assessment.

Northern California Current (British Columbia) Pacific cod (Gadus 
macrocephalus) production

Biology 
 
Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) grow rapidly in 
Canada in the first year, reaching 30 cm by age 1, 
and are sexually mature by ages 2 to 3 years 
(Westrheim, 1987).  Length at first maturity is 
approximately 40 cm, and length at 50% maturity is 
55 cm.  Pacific cod tend to disperse into deeper 
waters to feed, and congregate to spawn in shallower 
waters from February to March. They undergo a 
seasonal migration from shallow waters in the spring 
and summer to deeper waters in the fall and winter.  
Pacific cod in Canada are at the southern limit of 
their distribution and are therefore vulnerable to the 
expected climate and ocean changes.  Four stocks of 
Pacific cod are defined for management in British 
Columbia: Strait of Georgia, west coast of 
Vancouver Island, Queen Charlotte Sound and 
Hecate Strait.  In Hecate Strait, stock abundance 
remains at historic lows, recruitment of the last 9 
year classes has been below historic levels, and the 
1998 year class was the smallest ever.  Abundance 
off the west coast of Vancouver Island also remains 
low.  Pacific cod were common in the Strait of 
Georgia in the past.  Presently, few remain, possibly 
because of the increase in water temperatures in 
recent years. 
Fishery 
 
Small Pacific cod fisheries take place in Queen 
Charlotte Sound and off the lower west coast of 
Vancouver Island.  The major fishing occurs in Hecate 
Strait.  Spawning stock biomass and recruitment has 
been estimated for Hecate Strait using stock 
reconstruction based on ages estimated from lengths.  
The species is a significant component of the multi-
species groundfish fishery in Hecate Strait.  Annual 
yields have varied between a high of 8,870 t in 1987 
to a low of approximately 200 t in 2001.  Landings 
since the mid-1990s have been very low (Fig. 2.3).  
The trawl fishery has undergone a number of 
significant changes in recent years.  Prior to 1992, the 
total catch of Pacific cod was unrestricted and the 
main management measures were area and season 
closures.  Total allowable catches were introduced in 
the Hecate Strait area in 1992, in response to declining 
abundance.  Trip limits were also introduced in the 
same year and these decreased steadily until 1995.  
For the 1996 season, trawl catches were limited to 
bycatch only because of stock concerns.  Stock 
declines resulted from a decade of below average 
recruitment.  The pattern of recruitment (age 2+) in 
Hecate Strait from 1960 to 1988 was similar but the 
recent regime (1989–1997) is characterized by 9 years 
of very poor recruitment.

Climate and ocean effects 
 
The potential impacts of climate change on Pacific 
cod off British Columbia are summarized in Table 2.3. 
High sea levels in the Prince Rupert area are 
associated with high transport rates through Hecate 
Strait, resulting in poor recruitment for Pacific cod. 
Sea levels were high in the Prince Rupert area up 
until 2003 when they began to decline.  The 
relationship between sea level and recruitment can be 
39 
interpreted as an indication of the sensitivity of 
Pacific cod to ocean conditions.  Temperatures in the 
range of 6.0 to 7.0°C appear to be optimal for Pacific 
cod recruitment.  Temperatures higher than 7.0°C 
will likely decrease recruitment.  Laboratory studies 
on the effect of temperature on Pacific cod egg 
survival indicate that the optimal temperature is 
between 3.5 to 4.0°C, with an acceptable range of 2.5 
to 8.5°C (Alderdice and Forrester, 1971).  Bottom 
temperatures in February that exceed 8.5°C would 
most probably reduce or eliminate recruitment.  The 
southern limit of the commercial abundance of 
Pacific cod is northern Oregon and the southern limit 
of landings has been southern Oregon.  Thus, there is 
little doubt that Pacific cod in British Columbia are 
at the southern limit of their distribution and are a 
sensitive indicator of temperature increases.  
 
Projections of temperature changes are for both 
surface waters and ocean temperatures in general to 
change more slowly than land temperatures. 
However, in 2006 bottom temperatures in March at 
the Nanoose Lighthouse in the Strait of Georgia were 
approximately 9.6°C. Thus, it is apparent that several 
degrees of warming will change the southern limit of 
Pacific cod distribution, and will perhaps move it as 
far north as southern Alaska. Pacific cod recruitment 
is therefore a sensitive indicator of ocean changes 
affecting groundfish.  It is predicted that Pacific cod 
will gradually disappear from the Strait of Georgia 
and off the west coast of Vancouver Island as bottom 
temperatures warm.

Northern California Current (British Columbia) sablefish (Anoplopoma 
fimbria) production

Biology 
 
In Canada, most juvenile sablefish (Anoplopoma 
fimbria) inhabit the shallow waters of Hecate Strait 
and the west coast of Vancouver Island, and move to 
slope waters off northern and southern British 
Columbia as they mature.  It is believed that there are 
two sablefish populations of the west coast of North 
America, separated at approximately 50°N into an 
Alaskan population and a west coast population. 
There is debate about the degree of movement 
between these two populations.  Recent information 
using stable isotopes found in otoliths indicates that a 
third population may exist at the southern limit of the 
distribution.  Adult sablefish are abundant in coastal 
British Columbia waters at depths greater than  
200 m, and are most abundant between 600 and  
800 m.  Spawning occurs from January to March 
along the entire Pacific coast, at depths of about 300 
to 500 m, with no appreciable latitudinal spawning 
migration.  Larval fish hatch at about 300 to 400 m, 
and then descend to 1000 m by 18 days after 
spawning.  Within a few days of their descent, larval 
sablefish begin to ascend and feed on copepod 
larvae.  Recruitment appears to be determined at the 
larval stage.  Juveniles are found in more shallow  
(< 200 m) inshore waters and rear in nearshore and 
shelf habitats until age 2–5.  As sablefish mature, 
they move back into the deeper water where 
spawning occurred. 
 
Growth of sablefish is rapid in the first few years, 
and then slows appreciably in this long-lived species. 
Length and age at 50% maturity are 58 cm, age 5 for 
females, and 53 cm, age 5 for males.  Males tend to 
undergo a reduction in growth rate earlier than 
females.  The majority of fish in the fishery are 
between the ages of 4 and 35, but the oldest sablefish 
aged to date is 113 years.  In Canadian waters 
important prey items for sablefish include rockfish, 
Pacific herring and squid.   
 
Fishery 
 
The sablefish fishery is one of the few and oldest 
deep water fisheries of the world.  The fishery was 
reported to be as large as about 6000 t in the 1910s. 
This early fishery provided a smoked or salted meat 
product and used the livers for vitamin A and D 
production.  The fishery was encouraged as a way to 
adapt to a shortage of meat during the First World 
War.  Catches declined into the 1920s, possibly 
because of a reduced demand after the war.  It was 
not until the late 1960s that catches of sablefish 
increased as a consequence of a Japanese fishery 
established outside of Canada’s exclusive fishing 
zone.  Following the extension of the exclusive 
fishing zone in 1977, the fishery was exclusively 
Canadian and accounted for annual catches ranging 
from 830 t in 1978 to 5,381 t in 1989.  The average 
commercial landings from 1978 to 2002 have been 
4,071 t (Fig. 2.4).   
 
Sablefish landings fluctuated in the 1990s, with 
declines in recent years (Fig. 2.4).  The declines in 
catch are related to declines in biomass as indicated 
by the trend in catch per unit effort (Fig. 2.5).  Since 
1973 the dominant fishing gear used by the fishery 
has been Korean conical traps (73% of the annual 
landings).  In 1990, the fishery switched to an 
individual quota for each vessel in an attempt to 
stabilize the length of the fishing season, to improve 
management, to optimize the landed value, and to 
reduce quota over-runs. 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
Potential impacts of climate change on sablefish off 
British Columbia are summarized in Table 2.3. 
Sablefish exhibit decadal-scale patterns in the 
relative success of year classes.  By combining 
estimates of relative abundance of year classes 
determined from commercial catches and research 
surveys for adults and juveniles, McFarlane and 
Beamish (1992) and King et al. (2000) were able to 
reconstruct an index of year-class success.  Year 
classes from 1960 to 1976 were generally poor, with 
no indication of good year-class success.  The 1977 
year class was exceptionally large and year classes 
from 1978 to 1988 were generally good or average.

Year classes following 1989 and 1990 were 
generally poor.  McFarlane and Beamish (1986) 
proposed that sablefish live up to > 70 years because 
their ability to reproduce successfully each year was 
restricted by their biology and habitat.  Their 
longevity, therefore, represented the longest period 
of unsuccessful reproduction over evolutionary time. 
If this hypothesis is valid, sablefish recruitment is 
closely related to specific kinds of climate-related 
ocean conditions.  One limiting factor would be the 
ability of the fragile eggs to remain suspended in 
mid-depths, and for the larval sablefish to find 
copepod eggs and nauplii immediately after they 
begin exogenous feeding.  It was observed that 
despite a large fecundity, strong year classes resulted 
from both large and small spawning biomass 
(McFarlane and Beamish, 1986).  It was also 
observed that the production of strong year classes 
was closely associated with copepod production at a 
site off the west coast of Vancouver Island 
(McFarlane and Beamish, 1992).  The periods of 
above average year-class strength coincided with 
stronger Aleutian Lows, more frequent southwesterly 
winds, below average temperatures in the subarctic 
Pacific and warmer sea surface temperatures off the 
west coast of British Columbia (King et al., 2000).  
In general, the pattern of year-class success matches 
the patterns of regimes and regime shifts.  This is 
evidence that there are trends in sablefish production 
that are related to climate and ocean conditions on a 
decadal scale.  The recent declines in biomass  
(Fig. 2.5) reflect fishing removal and declining 
recruitment, which is related to the generally less 
productive regime in the 1990s. 
 
There is concern that fishing is reducing the number 
of age classes in the population, resulting in a 
population of relatively young fish (Beamish et al., 
2006).  However, because adult sablefish appear to 
be able to adapt to natural short-term and long-term 
43 
shifts in ocean conditions, it is probable that global 
warming will not have impacts on adult sablefish in a 
time frame of 50 years that will threaten the long-
term dynamics of the population. This does not mean 
that specific global warming impacts on the survival 
of eggs, larvae and juveniles will not occur, but 
rather that the adult fish may be able to survive such 
adverse conditions.  Also, there will be time to detect 
changes in the population dynamics and to consider 
management options, but this also does not mean that 
the population will be able to support current levels 
of exploitation, particularly at rates of around 15%. 
 
An immediate concern is the impact of fishing on the 
population structure and the natural ability of 
sablefish to survive in unfavourable conditions. 
Fishing impacts over the past 30 years have reduced 
the percentage of older fish in the population.  It is 
possible that resilience to long periods of 
unfavourable climate may be lost.  If the remaining 
fish still have the ability to live for extended periods, 
this resiliency may not be lost.  If the impacts of 
global warming are negative and reproduction is less 
successful or fails, it may be important to ensure that 
a percentage of the existing population is allowed to 
live to the older ages that existed prior to commercial 
fishing.  This may be best accomplished by 
establishing no fishing zones that are in the most 
favourable spawning areas.  If periods of intense 
Aleutian Lows increase as a consequence of global 
warming, there is a possibility that recruitment 
periods may increase relative to the past 50 years.

Pink and chum salmon will probably respond in a 
similar way to a changing climate as the fry for both 
species spend only short periods in fresh water and 
enter the ocean at about the same time. In the Strait 
of Georgia their early growth is strongly correlated 
among years (Fig. 2.6).  Pink salmon are the better 
indicator of climate impacts as their shorter life span 
and genetically distinct odd- and even-year runs 
provide more information sooner. 
 
Pink salmon biology 
 
Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) are the most 
abundant of the Pacific salmon in British Columbia 
waters. They have the shortest life span, 
approximately two years from hatching, and are the 
smallest salmon species.  Pink salmon form distinct 
spawning brood-lines, with some stocks spawning in 
years with even numbers (i.e., 1996) and some with 
odd numbers (i.e., 1997).  The largest stocks of pink 
salmon occur in the Fraser River, where spawning 
takes place only in odd-numbered years.  Farther 
north, spawning occurs in all years, with a tendency 
for the even-year spawning stocks to predominate. 
Although pink salmon exist farther south than British 
Columbia, the center of distribution is north of British 
Columbia.  Fraser River stocks, therefore, are close to 
the southern limit of the range.  Females may produce 
1,200 to 1,900 eggs, depending on the stock and the 
body length of the female.  Spawning occurs from 
July through to early fall in riverbeds with coarse 
gravel.  Pink salmon prefer to spawn in swift currents 
along the borders of streams or in riffle areas. 
 
Pink salmon fishery 
 
Pink salmon are not held in high esteem in British 
Columbia, thus catches probably are not a good 
indicator of abundance.  This is particularly true in 
recent years when there has been exceptional 
production in some stocks with virtually no 
commercial fishery.  In Canada, annual total catches 
of pink salmon averaged 19.7 thousand t or 
approximately 14.7 million fish from 1959 to 2000. 
Total catches of pink salmon increased after the 1977 
regime shift, reaching a maximum in the early 1980s. 
Since the early 1990s, there has been a dramatic 
reduction in catch (Fig. 2.7A).

A recent analysis of the coast-wide production of 
pink salmon indicated that over the past decade, the 
spawning abundances may have doubled or tripled 
compared to numbers in the 1960s and 1970s.  Pink 
salmon produced in the Fraser River historically 
account for about 60% of the total British Columbia 
catch, although some of this 60% is caught by the 
United States.  Their population dynamics and the 
response of the fishery is probably a good indicator 
of the dynamics of most pink salmon stocks.  As 
mentioned, virtually all stocks of pink salmon in the 
Fraser River spawn in odd-numbered years.  The 
reason for the persistent dominance of these “odd-
year stocks” and the general phenomenon of 
dominance among pink salmon stocks is unknown.  
In 2001 and 2003, there was a large return of pink 
salmon to the Fraser River.  Management policy 
resulted in an exploitation rate on this return that was 
very low, resulting in a spawning escapement that 
was approximately two times the highest estimated 
escapement on record and at least a magnitude larger 
than escapements in the 1950s.  These exceptional 
returns were the production from one of the lowest 
escapements on record in 1999.  Clearly, there was a 
dramatic increase in the marine survival of pink 
salmon fry entering the Strait of Georgia in 2000. 
 
Juvenile pink salmon in the Strait of Georgia 
compete with other juvenile salmon.  Because pink 
salmon spawn in the Fraser River in odd-numbered 
years, the juveniles are abundant in the Strait of 
Georgia in even-numbered years.  The abundance of 
juvenile coho salmon is frequently reduced in July in 
even-numbered years, compared to odd-numbered 
years (Fig. 2.8).

Chum salmon biology 
 
Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) may exist in 
about 800 rivers in British Columbia (Salo, 1991). 
There are distinct summer and fall spawning stocks, 
with the runs in the north being earlier than in the 
south.  In the south, spawning can occur from 
October to January.  In the spring, chum salmon are 
some of the first salmon to enter the ocean, 
remaining in the nearshore areas until the end of May 
(Healey, 1980).  Chum then move into more coastal 
waters, and by mid-summer they leave the inshore 
areas and migrate offshore and into the Gulf of 
Alaska (Hartt and Dell, 1986).  In recent years, chum 
salmon have remained inshore in large numbers 
through to mid-September (Beamish and Folkes, 
1998).  Most chum salmon (about 60%) spend three 
winters in the ocean.  The remaining fish spend two 
or four years at sea.  Very few spend five years at 
sea.  The average size at return is about 70–75 cm.  
Since the late 1970s, chum salmon have been 
produced in hatcheries.  The total production reached 
a maximum in the early 1990s, and in recent years 
has declined.  Chum eggs are hatched in hatcheries, 
and the fry are fed in channels prior to release.  In 
some cases, the fed fry are placed in sea pens and 
reared in salt water prior to release. 
 
Chum salmon fishery 
 
Chum salmon are generally the last species caught in 
the commercial fisheries.  Most fisheries occur near 
river mouths, or what are called “terminal areas.” 
Fishing is with purse seines or gillnets.  Smaller 
fisheries occur that use troll gear.  Chum salmon that 
retain their “silver colour” are frequently marketed 
for smoking. Chum salmon that are coloured 
externally are valued mainly for their roe.  In recent 
years, catches increased in the late 1980s through to 
the early 1990s (Fig. 2.7B).  Catches were low in the 
mid- to late 1990s through to the present. 
Assessments of total production generally show that 
it has been stable for the past 30 years (Godbout  
et al., 2004; Spilsted, 2004). 
 
Climate, ocean and global warming impacts  
 
The specific factors that regulate salmon abundance in 
the ocean are not clearly identified, making it difficult 
to predict the impacts of altered marine ecosystems. 
Changes that could occur in fresh water as a 
consequence of climate change would have a major 
impact on Pacific salmon.  These would impact on the 
migrations, spawning, hatching, and early rearing 
phases. Physical changes in temperature, precipitation, 
groundwater discharge, and increased ice-free periods 
for lakes could affect community structure and the 
survival, growth, and distribution of salmon species. 
 
The Fraser River drainage in British Columbia is a 
major producer of Pacific salmon, accounting for 30 
to 40% of all Pacific salmon produced in Canada. 
Because numerous stocks of the five species of 
salmon are at or near the southern limit of their range, 
the early impacts of climate change should be 
detectable in these stocks.  We know that a warmer 
climate will increase water temperatures and decrease 
flows during spawning migrations, increasing pre-
spawning mortality and reducing egg deposition  
(Figs. 2.9 and 2.10).  A warmer climate will increase 
water temperatures during egg incubation stages, 
causing premature fry emergence and increased fry-to-
smolt mortality.  At the same time, a warmer climate 
will increase the severity and frequency of winter 
floods, thereby reducing egg-to-fry survival rates. The 
productivity of lakes will be altered, but impacts on 
their suitability as nursery habitats for juvenile 
sockeye salmon is not known.

It is highly probable that there will be a direct 
relationship between increased river temperatures 
and pre-spawning mortalities for all salmon. In fact, 
in the late 1990s, abnormally high pre-spawning 
mortality occurred, and one of the explanations 
related the mortality to changes in climate.  The 
impact of climatic warming on winter water 
temperatures is uncertain. Winter water temperatures 
are related to groundwater base flows, lake water 
runoff, precipitation levels, and perhaps changes in 
snowmelt patterns.  It is probable, however, that both 
summer and winter temperatures will be higher.   
 
Pacific salmon are particularly susceptible to 
temperature fluctuations because they have adapted 
to thermal regimes in both fresh and salt water.  At 
the southern limits of salmon distribution, projected 
climatic changes would warm both marine and 
freshwater habitats, especially in the winter.  High 
temperature has a profound effect on fishes because 
they cannot regulate their body temperature. Extreme 
temperatures may kill eggs, juveniles, or adult 
salmon; less extreme temperatures can affect growth, 
reproduction, and movement. Recommended 
temperatures for most Pacific salmon in fresh water 
range from about 7° to 16°C, with extremes from 3° 
to 20°C.  Upper lethal temperatures are 25° to 26°C. 
Southern rivers could approach these higher limits 
under projected climatic scenarios. 
 
Stream discharge patterns have a high degree of 
variation, and changes in the variability of timing 
and the expected increase in variation could reduce 
the accuracy of management and result in the need 
for reduced exploitation rates.  Warming of fresh 
water in the north may also improve production. Much of 
the increases in total Pacific salmon abundance in the 
1980s occurred in Alaska stocks, possibly indicating that 
warming in fresh water and coastal areas at this time was 
beneficial for salmon production.  However, the function 
of northern aquatic systems has not been well 
documented, and large temperature increases could have 
unforeseen effects on Pacific salmon survival. 
 
Beamish and Noakes (2004) examined the role of 
climate change on the past, present and future of 
Pacific salmon species off the west coast of Canada. 
They suggested that existing stock assessment models 
might be inadequate to predict the dynamics of a stock 
in a future of climate change.  They provided one 
scenario that predicts an increase in the total 
production of Pacific salmon as climate changes.  This 
contrasts with other interpretations, such as that of 
Welch et al. (1998), who used estimates of sea surface 
temperature increases to propose that the ocean habitat 
available to sockeye salmon would diminish and 
would move farther north.  Both scenarios are possible 
and need to be evaluated as climate changes become 
more extreme.  Beamish and Noakes (2004) also 
noted that Pacific salmon in general, and pink salmon 
in particular, may move into the Canadian Arctic in 
increasing numbers. 
 
Pacific salmon are well known for their homing 
ability from feeding areas in the open ocean to the 
exact areas of their birth in coastal freshwater rivers. 
49 
Less well known is their ability to stray.  This 
straying rate can range up to 10% and provides 
Pacific salmon with an ability to adapt to large-scale 
climate change such as past periods of glaciation.  
 
The Arctic is one area that may be exhibiting early 
impacts of global warming.  Model predictions 
indicate that a doubling of CO
2 
would reduce the 
extent of sea ice by 60% and the volume by 25–45% 
(Gordon and O’Farrell, 1997).  There would also be 
greater freshwater runoff.  During the period 1978–
1996 there has been a 2.9–3.5% per decade decrease 
in the extent of Arctic sea ice (Cavalieri et al., 1997, 
Serreze et al., 2000). If such dramatic changes were to 
continue, conditions favorable to straying and perhaps 
feeding for pink and chum salmon may improve. 
 
In the ocean, we expect that the major sources of 
early marine mortality will become more variable 
and more extreme.  Predation may increase as more 
pelagic predators such as Pacific hake and mackerel 
move north.  Growth-based mortality (Beamish and 
Mahnken, 2001) may become more important and 
more variable.  It may be possible to mitigate 
climate-related changes in fresh water; however, 
adjusting management to adapt to climate-related 
changes in the ocean would range between 
challenging and impossible.  Nonetheless, if climate-
related impacts could be identified quickly, it may be 
possible to use this information to show that 
reductions in greenhouse gases are essential for the 
protection of Pacific salmon at their southern range. 
 
The short life span of pink salmon of two years 
between spawning, as well as their abundance and 
extensive distribution, makes pink salmon a desirable 
species for studies of environmental impacts such as 
greenhouse gas-induced climate change on the long-
term population dynamics of all Pacific salmon. The 
increase in marine survival of this species in 2000 
coincided with a major shift in the trend of climate 
indicators.  Thus, there is evidence that pink salmon 
respond to climate changes in a time frame that could 
be used to detect the impacts of greenhouse gas-
induced climate change.  Pink salmon are an 
excellent indicator species because they are 
distributed throughout the subarctic Pacific and there 
is a long history of careful management.  The single 
year class and the short life span facilitate 
associations between climate change and estimates 
of production.  Additionally, the tendency for pink 
salmon to stray may also become an important 
indicator of factors affecting distributions.

salmon in British Columbia are summarized in

River stocks will suffer major impacts in fresh water 
and in the ocean.  Pink and chum salmon from the 
Fraser River will be reduced in abundance as a 
consequence of reduced fresh water survival as 
juveniles and spawning adults.  Pink and chum 
salmon stocks from the Skeena and Nass rivers and 
to the north could increase in abundance as a result 
of improved ocean productivity.  Pacific salmon 
probably will begin to reproduce in Arctic rivers. 
Basin-scale changes in growth, survival and straying 
rates will all indicate when large-scale changes 
occur.  Pink salmon will be excellent indicators of 
climate-related change and could be used as 
biological indicators of the changing ecosystems.

U.S. walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) production in the eastern Bering Sea 
and Gulf of Alaska

Walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma, is a marine 
fish species that is highly fecund, producing millions of 
eggs per individual spawner, and has highly variable 
mortality rates in early life stages (Bailey and Ciannelli, 
2007).  A consequence of this reproductive strategy 
(producing lots of young with high expected mortality) 
is fluctuating annual recruitment levels (the number of 
young fish entering the population each year).  The 
instability of fluctuating year classes must be buffered 
by the averaging effect of many age classes in the 
population.  Although the recruitment of walleye 
pollock in the Gulf of Alaska is one of the better studied 
processes in the world, admittedly there is still much 
that is not well understood.  
 
Pollock is an opportunistic species that has a broad 
distribution range and has adapted to different 
environments (Bailey et al., 1999).  On the other hand, 
the population is limited by finding and adapting to 
local conditions that favor successful spawning 
(maximizing reproduction) and survival (minimizing 
mortality) of the early life stages.  Local populations of 
pollock respond differently to shifting environmental 
regimes, as warming periods have seen those stocks at 
the southern margins of the pollock distribution falter or 
fail (Bailey et al., 1999).  In the center of its distribution 
of mass in the eastern Bering Sea, pollock have been (if 
at all) favorably impacted by periods of environmental 
warming (Hollowed et al., 2001; Quinn and Niebauer, 
1995).  Delayed springtime blooms may be a factor 
negatively influencing recruitment in the Bering Sea 
(Mueter et al., 2006).  However, another recent study 
correlates cool temperatures in the Bering Sea with 
increasing recruitment (Megrey, Alaska Fisheries 
Science Center, Seattle, WA, pers. comm.).  In the Gulf 
of Alaska the situation appears more complex, as 
pollock have been initially favored by a warm 
environmental regime (e.g., stock increase in the late 
1970s and mid-1980s) but negatively impacted 
afterwards (Hollowed et al., 2001), possibly in 
association with an increase of predator biomass.  
However, a recent study has tentatively and weakly 
linked cool springtime sea surface temperature (SST) 
with increasing recruitment (A’mar, University of 
Washington, Seattle, WA, pers. comm.).  These 
conflicting findings illustrate the difficulty in relating 
environmental indices near the birth of the cohort to 
highly variable recruitment 3–4 years later. 
 
Pollock spawn once per year, in an event that involves 
individual pairing and courtship (Baird and Olla, 1991), 
and that is highly concentrated in space and time 
(Kendall and Picquelle, 1990).  Given the fragility of 
eggs and larvae to environmental conditions, and their 
concentration in space and time, the survival of a whole 
year class is vulnerable to the vagaries of the ocean and 
weather, such as storms passing through Shelikof Strait, 
the major spawning site.  On the other hand, pollock 
dynamics are buffered partly by multiple spawning 
stocks, spawning in different locales, compensatory 
mortality and by multiple age groups in the population. 
Spawning in different locations moderates the effects of 
temporal variation in habitat suitability by taking 
advantage of spatial variation.  While the long life span 
of pollock is an adaptation that tempers the high 
variation in year-class strength, a high abundance of 
predators on adults, as well as commercial fishing that 
removes older age groups, reduces the age span over 
which mean abundance is averaged (and perhaps other 
aspects of the contribution of older fish to the 
population’s viability).  As a consequence, the 
population could be dependent on fewer age groups, 
hence contributing to overall stock variability 
(Longhurst, 2002).  
 
The spawning regions of pollock are noted for mixing 
of coastal and nutrient-laden oceanic waters and 
stratification of the water column, which leads to 
enhanced productivity.  These conditions favor the 
survival of early life stages of pollock.  In the Gulf of 
Alaska pollock typically spawn during the last week in 
March and first week in April in Shelikof Strait 
(Ciannelli et al., 2007).  In this area, mixing of the 
Alaska Coastal Current, the Alaska Stream and coastal 
water, along with springtime increases in sunlight, 
warming and water column stratification, leads to a 
spring bloom and increasing zooplankton production.  
Zooplankton prey of pollock larvae are concentrated by 
 
54 
eddies and fronts (Napp et al., 1996), resulting in 
favorable feeding conditions.  Larvae are advected 
toward favorable nursery areas, such as the waters 
around the Shumagin Islands.  
 
Mortality rates of pollock eggs and young larvae are 
high, with estimates ranging from 4 to 40% per day, but 
they decline as larvae develop.  Larval conditions can 
vary from year to year and by location, and high 
percentages of larvae in the ocean have sometimes been 
observed in poor feeding condition (Theilacker et al., 
1996).  Egg and early larval development and survival 
are suboptimal at temperatures below about 0
o
 and 
above 10
o
–13
o
C (Blood, 2002).  Very high and low 
temperatures can be lethal to eggs and larvae, but 
generally for the Gulf of Alaska population, in the 
central part of the species distribution (4
o
–6
o
C 
springtime SST), higher temperatures may favor 
survival of early stages, perhaps through one or more 
indirect mechanisms (Bailey, 2000).  Optimal prey 
levels for successful feeding depend on many other 
conditions affecting predator–prey encounters, 
including larval size, temperature, light levels, turbidity 
and turbulence (Porter et al., 2005), but generally they 
range between 20 and 40 prey/liter (Theilacker et al., 
1996).  In very high density patches, pollock may 
deplete their prey (Duffy-Anderson et al., 2002), 
leading to slower growth and higher mortality.  At later 
stages, predation on juveniles is an important source of 
mortality.  Large piscivorous fishes, including halibut, 
cod, arrowtooth flounder and flathead sole contribute 
significantly to mortality of juvenile pollock 
(Livingston, 1993). 
 
An evolving perspective of the recruitment of pollock is 
that it is a complex process, influenced by both high 
frequency changes in the environment of young fish 
stages and by bounding effects of low frequency 
changes in the ecosystem (Bailey et al., 2005).  As a 
consequence, recruitment is caught in the push-pull 
between these scales.  Larval mortality is highly 
variable and subject to many interacting high frequency 
factors (such as storms and prey availability), with 
feedback and non-linearity (Bailey et al., 2004). Larvae 
show sophisticated behaviors involving choice and 
decisions when confronted with multiple and perhaps 
conflicting stimuli (Olla et al., 1996).  For example, 
they avoid turbulence by descending (Davis, 2001), 
taking them out of the photic zone and into colder water 
where growth is less optimal and prey are less abundant 
(Kendall et al., 1994).  Under normal circumstances, 
these conditions are associated with poor feeding and 
high mortality.  However, when prey are driven deeper 
by turbulence and there is bright daylight, these 
conditions are then optimal for feeding (Porter et al., 
2005).  Thus, environmental factors driving recruitment 
are governed by complex relationships.  On the other 
hand, although juveniles also show complicated 
behaviours in response to the environment (e.g., Sogard 
and Olla, 1996), they are less impacted by small-scale 
physics, and juvenile mortality seems to be more stable 
and predictable, occurring largely as a result of 
predation and density-dependent mechanisms.  The role 
of density-dependent mechanisms also seems to be 
influenced by environmental factors (Ciannelli et al., 
2004).  Environmental and ecosystem structure shifts 
may also have indirect effects on pollock survival, such 
as causing changes in the operation of density-
dependent mechanisms.  For example, Ciannelli et al. 
(2004) found that the level of density-dependent 
mortality in juvenile pollock increases when water 
temperature and predation intensity are high.  The 
build-up of predators in the community represents a 
low frequency, slowly changing pattern with lagged 
effects.  Changes in ecosystem structure may be related 
to the relative stage in life history when recruitment is 
determined (i.e., larval versus juvenile control) (Bailey, 
2000).  Therefore, control points may change from year 
to year, and depend on longer-term changes in the 
environment and community structure, such as those 
occurring with environmental and biological regime 
shifts.  General patterns in recruitment have been well 
described by models incorporating stochastic mortality 
related to environmental conditions during the larval 
period and by deterministic factors and constraints 
during the juvenile period (Ciannelli et al., 2004; 
Ciannelli et al., 2005).  It should be noted that although 
we have a fairly good understanding of how small-scale 
factors affect survival of early life stages, knowing how 
these factors combine and interact over larger and 
longer space and time scales (scale up), thus 
determining how pollock populations respond to the 
environment, fluctuating and shifting prey and predator 
abundances, and to self-regulation, is a difficult 
problem.

An important discovery in Bering Sea fisheries 
oceanography in recent years was the realization that 
climate variability at the scale of decades may have a 
direct effect on the productivity of winter spawning 
flatfish (Wilderbuer et al., 2002). The mechanism 
under consideration is related to the advection/ 
dispersal of larvae to favorable nearshore nursery 
habitat. To better understand the variability in the 
transport of larvae to these areas, an understanding 
and description of the following physical 
oceanographic variables would be needed: 
• Spring winds over the eastern Bering Sea shelf 
from April–June (Alaska Peninsula north to 
Nunivak Island, shelf margins to inner Bristol 
Bay);  
• Spring currents (April–June) from about 40 m 
depth to the surface for the same areas as 
described above.  Starting points should vary 
about 56°N latitude and 165°W longitude; 
• The influence and extent of the tidal cycle on the 
Bering Sea shelf oceanography.  Flatfish are 
known to take advantage of selective tidal 
transport and this may be the mechanism that 
takes them to their settlement areas once they get 
close enough.

The general state of knowledge on the mechanisms 
linking climate to crab production in the eastern 
Bering Sea can be summarized as follows: 
• Good progress has been made to compare the 
geographic distributions of crabs with respect to 
topography, bottom temperature, and life stage. 
• Reconstructed time series of abundance and 
recruitment have been generated by length-based 
population estimation models. 
• Hypotheses have been generated, but testing of 
hypotheses is very limited. 
• Forecasts of future crab abundances under global 
climate change using IPCC model outputs is 
difficult until further research is conducted to 
identify and confirm evidence for hypothesized 
recruitment mechanisms.  
 
Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) 
 
• A workshop of Tanner crab experts was convened 
to generate a list of hypothesized biophysical 
mechanisms by life stage as well as a conceptual 
model of recruitment mechanisms (Tyler and 
Kruse, 1997).  Recruitment is only weakly related 
to stock size; residuals suggest a 13- to 14-year 
cycle likely driven by environmental factors 
(Zheng and Kruse, 2003). 
• Statistical testing of a few hypotheses has been 
completed, with results pointing toward adverse 
effects of cold bottom temperatures on 
gametogenesis and favourable effects of 
northeasterly winds on larval advection and/or 
prey production.  However, regression models 
with these two variables explained only 50% of 
the variability (Rosenkranz et al., 1998, 2001). 
An update of the wind relationship explains even 
less variability than previously identified.  
• There is no relationship between Pacific cod 
biomass and Tanner crab recruitment, but Zheng 
and Kruse (2006) found some evidence that 
spatial distributions of predator and prey are more 
important that predator abundance.  
 
Other mechanisms need more thorough investigation 
through statistical testing and simulation modeling. 
These include the positive effect of warmer sea surface 
temperatures on production of copepod nauplii, thus 
enhancing larval Tanner crab feeding success (Tyler 
and Kruse, 1997; Rosenkranz et al., 2001). 
 
Table 2.7 lists six potential mechanisms linking 
climate and Tanner crab production. Many more could 
be examined (Tyler and Kruse, 1997).  There is a high 
level of uncertainty about mechanisms affecting 
Tanner crab recruitment, but work to date sets a good 
foundation for additional research into these 
mechanisms.  Development of a recruitment model for 
Tanner crab is currently being proposed to the North 
Pacific Research Board.  A length-based model, 
already developed for previous management strategy 
evaluations (Zheng and Kruse, 1999, 2000), could 
form the basis for such projections once the climate–
recruitment linkages become better elucidated. 
 
Red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) 
 
• A workshop of red king crab experts was 
convened to generate a list of hypothesized 
biophysical mechanisms by life stage, as well as a 
conceptual model of recruitment mechanisms 
(Tyler and Kruse, 1996).  A Ricker stock-recruit 
relationship is indicated, but autocorrelated 
recruitment trends are also consistent with 
decadal climate shifts (Zheng and Kruse, 2003).  
• Limited correlation analysis points toward 
potential relationships between recruitment and 
the strength of the Aleutian Low (perhaps through 
a wind-mixing, prey (Thalassiosira diatom) 
availability mechanism (Tyler and Kruse, 1996; 
Zheng and Kruse, 2000, 2006).  Also, red king 
crab recruitment is negatively correlated with the 
biomass of both Pacific cod and yellowfin sole 
(Zheng and Kruse, 2006).  Correlations with 
barometric pressure, cod abundance and 
yellowfin sole abundance explain only 36%, 36%, 
and 69% of the variability, respectively, but 
comprehensive statistical testing of hypotheses 
has not been conducted. 
• Northeastward shifts in red king crab brood stock 
are associated with increased bottom shelf 
 
60 
temperatures in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
possibly reducing the successful drift of larvae to 
juvenile nursery areas in nearshore areas of 
Bristol Bay (Loher and Armstrong, 2005). 
• Another recruitment mechanism may be that 
reduced sea ice leads to better matching of the 
spring bloom with larval hatching times (Kruse, 
2007), which may be opposite for snow crab that 
may benefit in cold years (Orensanz et al., 2004).  
It has been proposed that increased heat in the 
ocean causes a shift of energy flow away from 
benthic invertebrates to pelagic species 
(Grebmeier et al., 2006). 
• All mechanisms require more thorough investigation 
through statistical testing and simulation modeling.  
 
Table 2.8 lists six potential mechanisms linking 
climate and red king crab production. Many more 
could be examined (see Tyler and Kruse, 1996). 
There is a high level of uncertainty about 
mechanisms affecting red king crab recruitment. 
Work to date has focussed primarily on the 
generation of hypotheses and the cursory 
examination of evidence for a handful of them.  A 
more thorough retrospective analysis of red king crab 
recruitment mechanisms has not yet been conducted. 
A length-based model, already developed for 
management strategy evaluations (Zheng et al., 
1997a,b), could perhaps form the basis for such 
projections once the climate–recruitment linkages 
become better elucidated.

Snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) 
 
• A workshop of snow crab experts was convened 
to generate a list of hypothesized biophysical 
mechanisms by life stage, as well as a conceptual 
model of recruitment mechanisms (Kruse et al., 
2007).  
• Analysis of stock and recruitment data does not 
suggest a density-dependent relationship; 
residuals indicate favorable environmental 
conditions in the 1980s and poor conditions in the 
1990s (Zheng and Kruse, 2003). 
• Snow crab brood stock shifted to the northwest 
after the 1970s (Zheng et al., 2001, Orensanz et 
al., 2004, 2005; Zheng and Kruse, 2006).  The 
shift north may be related to warming bottom 
temperatures in the late 1970s; return shifts may 
be prevented by predation by cod (Orensanz et 
al., 2004).  
• Snow crab nursery habitat is located in the northeast 
shallow waters of the eastern Bering Sea (Somerton, 
1981; Zheng et al., 2001; Zheng and Kruse, 2006; 
Ernst et al., 2005).  Crabs appear to follow 
temperature gradients during their cross-shelf, 
ontogenetic migrations with age/size (Ernst et al., 
2005).  
• Recruitment may be driven by larval advection 
from hatching locations to nursery areas. 
Recruitment success may be affected by changing 
brood stock location driven by bottom temperature, 
advection by ocean currents, duration of pelagic 
stage dependent upon development rates driven by 
upper water column temperature, and survival 
affected by cod predation (Orensanz et al., 2004; 
Zheng and Kruse, 2006).  Examination of these 
processes is ongoing by the National Marine 
Fisheries Service and University of Washington 
scientists (Parada et al., pers. comm.). 
• Recruitment may be driven partly by the match 
between snow crab larvae and the spring bloom, 
which may be timed best in cold years (Orensanz 
et al., 2004). 
• Cannibalism among year classes is likely an 
important density-dependent survival mechanism, 
with successful older year classes suppressing 
young of the year (Lovrich and Sainte-Marie, 
1997; Sainte-Marie and Lafrance, 2002). 
• To date, work has focussed on hypothesis 
generation rather than testing.  Ongoing research 
using an individual-based model incorporating 
ROMS output is the first substantive effort to 
examine recruitment processes for snow crabs in 
the eastern Bering Sea.

Table 2.9 lists six potential mechanisms linking 
climate and snow crab production. Many more could 
be examined (see Tyler and Kruse, 1996).  There is a 
high level of uncertainty about mechanisms affecting 
snow crab recruitment.  Retrospective analyses have 
been constrained by the lack of a length-based 
population model for snow crabs. Recent 
development of this model now provides a 
recruitment time series and could give the framework 
for projections of future recruitment.  However, 
analyses of linkages between climate and recruitment 
may need to be concluded before projections could 
be reasonably attempted.

In this short paper, we briefly answer the requests 
sent by the workshop convenors in advance of the 
workshop. 
 
Request 1. Oceanographers and climatologists should 
identify what techniques they recommend for forecasting 
oceanographic responses to climate change. 
 
To make better predictions, we must have knowledge 
of the performance of the models, i.e., “which model 
can properly represent the target area”.  There is a 
good example, described by Overland and Wang 
(2007), that only 10 of 22 tested Atmosphere–Ocean 
Coupled General Circulation Models (AOGCM) can 
reproduce an appropriate Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
(PDO) pattern in the 20th century.  Therefore, the 
first step is to select models that are capable of being 
applied to the target regions (space) and phenomena 
(space and time). 
 
To make better predictions, we should also have a 
comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that 
link environments and ecosystem responses. However, 
even the environmental data are usually limited in 
time and space.  Therefore, we recommend testing 
model performance by reconstructing past 
environments using the data assimilation method. 
Especially for physical models, adjoint methods can 
fit the model to observational data while conserving 
model dynamics.  For example, to examine bottom-up 
forcing, coupled bio-physical models would be used 
to predict lower trophic productivity.  Output from 
these models could be compared to observed patterns 
of plankton variability to assess model performance. 
 
We cannot eliminate the uncertainties in forecasting. 
Uncertainties arise not only from the models but also 
from the scenarios.  Therefore, we recommend 
ensemble forecasts using several models under 
several scenarios. 
 
It is obvious that computer power is limited, even in 
the current IT era.  The horizontal resolution of 
AOGCMs is becoming finer, but usually ¼° is the 
limit.  One way to save the computational costs of 
contemporary models is to nest higher resolution 
regional models into coarser resolution global models.  
Another possibility is to run higher resolution regional 
models under the predicted atmospheric conditions.  
However, in those cases, the selection of the 
horizontal boundary conditions becomes an issue. 
 
In summary, the following steps are recommended: 
• verification of model performance (bias + 
variability); 
• reconstruction of past environments by lower 
trophic level model simulation on the data 
assimilated physical model outputs; 
• ensemble forecasts; 
• nesting model or simple regional model run. 
 
Request 2. Fisheries scientists should provide 
reports on the current state of knowledge regarding 
mechanisms linking climate forcing and fish 
production, and the uncertainty associated with these 
mechanisms. 
 
Walleye pollock 
Spawning is restricted to a very narrow area with the 
main spawning ground occurring in Hidaka Bay, 
Hokkaido.  The environmental conditions of Hidaka 
Bay and the flow field inside and outside of the bay 
is the most important factor for determining 
recruitment (see the VENFISH special issue in 
Fisheries Oceanography, Vol. 13, Suppl. 1, 2004). 
 
Pacific cod 
The landings of Pacific cod in the Tohoku area 
(northern part of Honshu) have a good correlation 
with the recruitment of the 1+ year class.  This 
suggests the importance of recruitment to the total 
biomass. A recent study by Shimizu and Narimatsu 
(2006) showed that sea surface temperature in June 
is a critical control of recruitment.  The mechanism 
is still unclear but June is the season when the life 
stage of Pacific cod changes from pelagic to demersal. 
 
64 
Pacific herring 
The abundance of herring remains low in Japan. 
Several local herring increases have occurred since 
the late 1990s.  Recently Ookouchi et al. (2008) 
showed that this increase was associated with the 
southward shift of the Oyashio in summer. 
 
Sardine, anchovy, jack mackerel, Pacific saury 
Small pelagic species alternate with an inter-decadal 
time scale.  The cycle changes from “sardine” to 
“saury and anchovy and horse mackerel” to “jack 
mackerel”, correlating well with the PDO (Yatsu et 
al., 2005). Takasuka et al. (2007) and subsequent 
studies simply explained this alternation by an 
“optimal growth temperature hypothesis”.  We guess 
this means that the larvae always meet with prey 
limitations, then higher temperatures decrease the 
growth by higher metabolism.  Another possibility is 
predator migration dependency on temperature. 
 
An additional important aspect of these small pelagic 
fish is migration.  They spawn in the subtropical 
ocean and make feeding migrations to the subarctic 
region.  Therefore, the transportation of larvae by the 
Kuroshio and migration mechanism is a key factor 
for their survival (e.g., Ito et al., 2007). 
 
Pacific salmon 
Pacific salmon utilize fresh water, coastal and open 
ocean habitats so the background ecosystems are 
totally different from each other.  Therefore, we must 
take into account not only marine life stages but also 
freshwater stages (e.g., Rand et al., 2006).  Azumaya 
and Ishida (2004) and Kamezawa et al. (2007) 
applied a model of Pacific salmon, and their results 
showed that summer conditions are most important 
to salmon growth. 
 
Request 3. Fisheries scientists should identify what 
physical or bio-physical drivers or environmental 
thresholds would be needed to forecast future fish or 
shellfish production.  These requests should specify 
the location (latitude and longitude) and time period 
for the requested physical variable. 
 
Based on the mechanisms mentioned in Request 2, 
we declare the drivers we need to know for the 
following species: 
Walleye pollock 
• Temperature and salinity structures in Hidaka 
Bay and its offshore region; 
• Circulation in Hidaka Bay and its offshore region 
with 1/108° resolution; 
• Primary and secondary production in Hidaka Bay 
and its offshore region (krill and benthos biomass 
around the Hokkaido coast). 
 
Pacific cod 
• Circulation around Japan, especially the Oyashio

The recent commercial fishery in the Russian sector 
of the Japan/East Sea (JES) is based on two fish 
species: Japanese sardine, Sardinops melanostictus, 
and walleye pollock, Theragra chalcograma, with 
landings exceeding 10,000 tonnes/year.  The catches 
of other pelagic and groundfish species such as 
mackerels, herring, flounders, salmon, greenlings, 
cod, and smelts, as well as bottom invertebrates are 
considerably lower (although valuable for some 
crabs, shrimps, and sea urchins).  Russian fisheries 
for Pacific saury and squids are almost absent in the 
JES, in spite of their high abundance.  Annual 
catches of both sardine and pollock fluctuate greatly 
(Fig. 2.11), due mainly to variability in environ-
mental conditions. 
 
Japanese sardine  
 
Fluctuations of the sardine stock and catch in the JES 
are synchronous with the stock and catch fluctuations 
in the Pacific Ocean, and have a decadal scale.  Both 
“sardine disasters” in the 20th century were initiated 
by climate shifts but the directions of environmental 
changes were opposite.  The early 1940s were 
characterized by ocean cooling, but the more recent 
cooling in the early 1990s occurred after ocean 
temperatures increased.  The apparent contradiction 
becomes clear under the match-mismatch hypothesis 
(Cushing, 1972) and its relevance to larval survival. 
The sardine has a very early (in late winter) spawn 
timing in the southeastern JES, with timing 
dependent on winter temperatures.  The spring 
bloom in these spawning grounds also begins very 
early (in early spring) but its timing depends on 
spring temperature conditions.  So, to match the 
larval hatch with the spring bloom, a thermal regime 
should be stable, as occurs with a warm-spring-after-
warm-winter or cold-spring-after-cold-winter.  The 
former was observed in the 1930s and the last one 
occurred in the late 1970s–1980s.  Stability was 
disrupted by sudden winter warming in the late 
1980s, causing a mismatch of timing, and 
consequently, low survival of the sardine larvae. 
 
Sardine reproduction is also determined by parental 
stock value (adults in the range of age from 3+ to 
6+), individual fecundity, and population density. 
Moreover, the adult survival rate is important. 
Therefore, the commercial stock of this species in 
year j can be roughly estimated by the following 
multiple regressive model:

coefficients.  This model generates stock abundance 
forecasts for at least 3 years in advance.  To predict 
the climate change consequences, we need to couple 
the model with long-term forecasts of SST. 
 
Walleye pollock 
 
Walleye pollock is a long-lived species so its stock is 
made up of several generations.  That is why its 
 
catch does not respond clearly to climate changes. 
However, the relative abundance of cohorts does. 
Year-to-year fluctuations have a strong correlation 
with zooplankton biomass in the spawning grounds 
during spring–summer when the pollock larvae and 
fingerlings develop (Fig. 2.12).  Zooplankton 
abundance in the JES depends on thermal conditions 
in the subsurface and intermediate layers where 
large-sized adult copepods have their dormancy and 
maturation. 
 
On decadal scales, cohort abundance is negatively 
correlated with the thermal regime (Fig. 2.13), in 
spite of the positive correlation between the 
subsurface temperature and zooplankton.

These statistical links are explained by simple 
ecological mechanisms: (i) the larvae mortality 
dependence on prey abundance and (ii) appearance–
disappearance of competitive warm-water species 
(sardine or common squid) on the biogeographic 
boundary where Peter the Great Bay is situated. 
Thus, these links could be used for pollock stock and 
catch forecasting with lead times of up to 3 years. 
Long-range forecasts are available on the basis of 
subsurface temperature predictions. 
 
Forecasting of environmental factors important 
for fish populations 
 
An Intermediate Water mass is formed in the JES at the 
Polar (Subarctic) Front in winter, and its temperature is 
determined by winter SST.  The spreading of this water 
is a mechanism to transfer climate change impacts into 
the subsurface and intermediate layers of the JES, 
which are so important for zooplankton and walleye 
pollock. We suppose that this spreading has an 
anticyclonic route, and estimate that the transfer time of 
the impacts from the sea surface to the subsurface layer 
is 0–3 years (the maximal delay is observed in the 
northwestern part of the JES).  
Winter SST in the JES is strongly correlated 
(negatively) with the development of the Siberian 
High: lower air temperatures arise from higher 
atmospheric pressures in Siberia, which create strong 
winter monsoon winds and lower SSTs (Fig. 2.14).  
 
Thus, the consequences of climate change for SST, 
subsurface temperature, and zooplankton abundance 
could be modeled using significant statistical links, 
at least until the system works.  Temporal lags 
between climate shifts and zooplankton responses 
can be as long as 5–6 years, mainly because of the 
time taken for Intermediate Water to be transported 
to the most distant areas of the JES. 
 
Spatial and temporal scales of environmental 
variables useful for fish production forecasting 
 
The location and time period of physical predictors 
for fish production forecasting are determined by the 
mechanisms of influence and are presented in  
Table 2.10.  In as much as some populations depend 
on prey abundance, zooplankton biomass is included 
as one of the subjects for forecasting.

Biology 
 
Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) are distributed 
widely across the North Pacific Ocean and in the 
Bering Sea, generally north of about 40–45°N 
latitude (Salo, 1991).  Chum salmon production in 
Korea hinges on the release of fry salmon from 
hatcheries.  The released fishes are thought to 
migrate from coastal areas to the Bering Sea and 
subarctic North Pacific (Fig. 2.15).  Release of 
fingerlings by artificial stocking programs occurs 
annually from mid-February to late March.  There is 
very little information about the ocean distribution 
and migration of Korean chum salmon in the North 
Pacific Ocean, but for now we assume that it is 
similar to that of chum salmon from Japanese 
hatcheries that are released from western Honshu and 
western Hokkaido.  The juveniles remain in the 
Okhotsk Sea from summer to late autumn and 
overwinter in the western North Pacific Ocean, and 
the immature salmon (age 2 to 5) then migrate back 
and forth between the Bering Sea and the North 
Pacific seasonally (Azumaya and Ishida, 2001; 
Urawa et al., 2001).  Spawning adults return to their 
natal rivers on the Korean Peninsula between mid-
September and mid-December. Main diets of chum 
salmon caught from the Subarctic Current and 
Alaskan Gyre areas consist of zooplankton such as 
copepods, pteropods, amphipods, euphausiids, and 
jellyfish (Kaeriyama et al., 2004).  
 
Fishery 
 
Escapement of chum salmon to Korean streams was 
very poor until the late 1980s.  Since 1990, catches 
from the set net fisheries were included in these 
statistics so that an abrupt increase appears in 1990 
(Fig. 2.16).  The proportion of salmon catch by set 
net fisheries in total catch was about 70~80% for the 
1990s and decreased to 50~70% in the 2000s. 
Salmon catch was seriously reduced from 553 
million t in 1997 to 51 million t in 2000.  It increased 
slightly in 2002 though it was still less than 200 
million t.

Climate and ocean effects 
 
The return rates of chum salmon to Korean waters 
were less than 0.4% for the broods released in the 
mid- and late 1980s, but escapement increased after 
the set net fishery was allowed in 1990.  Return rates 
ranged from 1.0 to 1.5% and suddenly dropped to 
0.1% for the 1997 brood stock which is still 
struggling to recover.  The return rate has a negative 
correlation with the mean water temperature of the 
coastal waters in April and May (r = –0.485, p < 0.05 
in April;  r = –0.599, p < 0.01 in May) (Fig. 2.17). 
High water temperature after late April could affect 
the survival of juvenile chum salmon and might be a 
reason for their mass mortality.  Maturing chum 
salmon returned in mid-November in the 1980s, in 
early November and/or in late October in the 1990s 
and in 2000s.  The return timing in 2003 was almost 
2 weeks earlier than in the 1980s (Fig. 2.18). 
Zooplankton biomass in the coastal waters of Korea 
in the year of release was not correlated with the 
return rate of Korean chum salmon.  However, early 
growth of chum salmon did correspond with trends 
of zooplankton biomass.  In river mouths and coastal 
areas, growth rates of fingerling salmon were higher 
in the 1990s than in the 1980s.  On the east coast of 
Korea, zooplankton abundance increased after the 
late 1980s, which may have caused favorable growth 
conditions for young salmon in the 1990s (Seo et al., 
2006).  They reported that food availability is more 
important than seawater temperature in chum salmon 
growth in the North Pacific, although it is not easy to 
decouple the effects of these factors on fish growth.

Biology 
 
Jack mackerel (Trachurus japonicus) migrate to the 
northern area of the East China Sea during January–
March, and to the spawning grounds near the western 
Kyushu Islands and areas between Jeju Island and 
Tsushima Island during April–May (Lee, 1970; 
Nakashima, 1982). Jack mackerel spawn in water 
temperatures from 16° to 22°C. In the East China Sea, 
jack mackerel larvae are mainly distributed in the 
Kuroshio frontal area along the continental margin in 
winter and spring. They usually feed on zooplankton, 
including the larvae of anchovy (Engraulis japonicus, 
E. mordax) and bigeye sardine (Etrumeus teres).  As 
the fish grow older, they move to deeper water and 
feed on larger prey such as Amphipoda and 
Mysidacea, but usually not Copepoda (Cha, 1991).  
 
There is evidence that the recruitment of jack 
mackerel is determined by the degree to which eggs 
and larvae are affected by environmental factors. 
These include seawater temperature, salinity, volume 
transport of the Kuroshio Current, and zooplankton 
biomass in the Korean waters (Zhang and Lee, 
2001). Increases in salinity in April, volume 
transport of the Kuroshio Current, and zooplankton 
biomass were significantly correlated with increased 
recruitment of jack mackerel in the following year 
(Table 2.11). 
 
Fishery 
 
Jack mackerel are found throughout the Yellow Sea, 
the East China Sea, and the southern East/Japan Sea 
(Kim, 1970).  They are caught with large purse 
seines, bottom trawls, and drift gill nets in Korean 
waters. About 80% of the total catches are from the 
large purse seine fishery, mostly in the Korean 
region of the East China Sea.  The history of catches 
is characterized by a cyclic behavior at a relatively 
low frequency (30 years) with a high coefficient of 
variation (CV = 0.74).  Annual catch reached the 
highest level of 48 thousand t in 1956, and then 
declined below 10 thousand t in the late 1960s.  In 
the early 1980s, the annual catch increased and it has 
been about 28 thousand t in recent years, 2002–2006 
(Fig. 2.19). 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
 
The volume transport of the Kuroshio increased after 
1977.  This intensified the Tsushima Warm Current 
connected with the Kuroshio in the inshore waters of 
southern Korea. Warm saline waters have a positive 
correlation with the density of jack mackerel 
distribution (Cho, 1981).  Therefore, the increase in 
salinity of the East China Sea may have triggered the 
increases in recruitment and biomass of jack 
mackerel in the early 1980s, resulting in the 
 
Table 2.11  Correlation coefficient matrix between recruitment of jack mackerel and environmental factors (Zhang and 
Lee, 2001).

increased fish catches.  The effects of the early 1980s 
environmental shift are hypothesized to have 
affected the productivity of the jack mackerel 
population (Fig. 2.20).  As the volume transport of 
the Tsushima Warm Current increases, resulting in 
higher salinity in the East China Sea, spawning 
grounds for jack mackerel become optimal. 
Consequently, high concentrations of the spawning 
stock were observed in this area.  As the intensity of 
the Tsushima Warm Current increased, the variation 
of zooplankton biomass in the Korean waters of the 
East China Sea was expected to correspond to the 
variation in the stratification of the ocean.  Since the 
thermocline in the East China Sea is formed at 30– 
50 m depth, and the water is relatively shallow (75–
150 m) (NFRDI, 2005) where photosynthesis can be 
active in all seasons, the increase in zooplankton 
biomass may not be directly related to the primary 
production in the early 1980s in the Korean waters of 
the East China Sea.  The increase of recruitment and

recruitment of jack mackerel (right) in Korean waters, 1968–2004 (Lee, 2005). 
 
 
biomass in plankton-feeding jack mackerel stock 
after the early 1980s can be attributed to the 
aggregation of spawning stock and the increase of 
prey organisms in the East China Sea (Zhang and 
Lee, 2001).  Jack mackerel share 63.4% of their 
habitat with chub mackerel in Korean waters (Zhang 
and Lee, 2001).  Jack mackerel share 36.6% of their 
habitat with both chub mackerel and Japanese 
sardine, and further, they were not found to co-exist 
with Japanese sardine exclusively during the period 
of 1980–1998 (Fig. 2.19).  The 1988 climatic regime 
shift affected the habitat of jack mackerel by shifting 
their distribution southward to 27
o
N. After 1988, the 
distributional overlap of jack mackerel and chub 
mackerel decreased.  These shifts in the habitats of 
both species resulted in Pacific sardine occupying a 
habitat area separated from the shared mackerel 
distributions (Zhang et al., 2004). 
 
An important discovery in Korean fisheries 
oceanography in recent years is the realization that 
climate variability, at the scale of decades, may have 
a direct effect on the productivity of winter spawning 
jack mackerel (Fig. 2.21).  The mechanism under 
consideration is the advection/dispersal of larvae to 
favorable nearshore nursery habitats.  
 
To better understand the variability in the transport 
of larvae to these favorable areas, an understanding 
and description of the following physical 
oceanographic variables are needed: 
• Springtime winds over the southern East China 
Sea from February–June.  Future winds from 
IPCC models have been provided by  
Dr. Nicholas Bond.  
• Springtime currents (February–June) from about 
50 m depth to the surface for the same areas as 
described above.  Starting points should vary 
about 26°N latitude and 123°E longitude. 
 
Recruitment is related to successful settlement in 
nursery grounds transported by the Kuroshio. Within 
a “touchdown zone” where larval jack mackerel

Biology 
 
Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) that migrate 
throughout the warm water are widely distributed and 
caught in the western, southern, and southeastern seas 
around the Korean peninsula, in the East China Sea, 
and around Japan.  This species is distributed on the 
continental shelf from the surface to 300 m depth in 
the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea (Fig. 2.22). 
Chub mackerel spawn from February to May when 
the water temperature ranges from 15° to 23°C, and  
migrate to wintering grounds between Jeju Island and 
Tsushima Island in the East China Sea during 
December–February.  The fecundity of chub mackerel 
ranges from 112,000 to 570,000 eggs, and the fork 
length of 50% mature females is 28.7 cm (Choi, 
2003). 
 
Mean length of chub mackerel has tended to 
decrease since the 1970s, and the proportion of small 
mackerel has increased (Fig. 2.23).  The fork length 
was about 32 cm in the early 1970s, but it has 
continuously decreased, with a mean fork length in 
2002 of 29.2 cm.  Some biological parameters such 
as natural mortality, maturity length, and recruitment 
age have been estimated (Table 2.12).

Fishery 
 
About 70–80% of the global catch of chub mackerel 
by countries, including Korea, Japan, and China, 
occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean (FAO, 
2002). Korean annual catches were below 100 
thousand t until the mid-1980s, and increased to 150 
thousand t in 1988 and 1989 (Fig. 2.24).  The annual 
catch was just 100 thousand t in the early 1990s. 
However, it started to increase to over 150 thousand t 
from the mid-1990s and reached the highest level of 
415 thousand t in 1996.  Currently, the catch is about 
170 thousand t.  This species is usually caught by 
large purse seines, drift gill nets, and set nets in 
Korean waters.  About 90% of total chub mackerel 
catches are from the large purse seine fishery, mainly 
in the East China Sea and in the western and 
southeastern seas of Korea. 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
 
Recruitment is correlated with salinity (r = 0.454,  
P < 0.05), with zooplankton biomass (r = 0.692,  
P < 0.01), and with copepod biomass (r = 0.815,  
P < 0.01) (Choi et al., 2000).  Chub mackerel catches 
were highly correlated with sea surface temperature 
(SST) in December, Chl-a in June, and large 
zooplankton in the fall and early winter (Table 2.13). 
 
Chub mackerel share 35.7% of their habitat with 
both jack mackerel and Pacific sardine, and 28.6% 
with jack mackerel or 3.1% with Pacific sardine in 
Korean waters (Zhang et al., 2004). 
 
The 1988 climatic regime shift affected the habitat of 
chub mackerel by widening and moving it to the west 
of 128°E (Fig. 2.25).  After 1988, the distributional 
overlap of chub mackerel and jack mackerel decreased. 
These shifts in the habitats of jack mackerel and chub 
mackerel resulted in Japanese sardine occupying a 
habitat area separated from the shared mackerel 
distributions.  Replacement in biomass between chub 
mackerel and Japanese sardine stocks came from the 
continuous competition of prey and space among major 
small pelagics in Korean waters (Zhang et al., 2000).

Table 2.14  Potential impacts of climate changes on the population ecology of mackerels in Korean waters. 
Species Impact factor Impacts of climate and ocean condition 
Chub 
mackerel 
• Seawater temperature, 
Kuroshio/Tsushima Warm Current,  
• Phytoplankton bloom,  
• Zooplankton biomass 
Chub mackerel abundances increased in the mid-1990s, a 
period of high SST in December due to ENSO seemed to 
cause high growth and good year classes in Korean waters 
(Kim and Kang, 2000; Zhang et al., 2004). 
Jack 
mackerel 
• Kuroshio/Tsushima Warm Current,  
• SST,  
• Phytoplankton bloom,  
• Zooplankton biomass 
As the Kuroshio transports eggs and larvae of jack 
mackerel to the fishing grounds, recruitment of jack 
mackerel increased. Increase in zooplankton biomass 
contributed to increase in spawning biomass of jack 
mackerel (Lee, 2005; Zhang et al., 2004). 
 
 
The possible impacts of global warming and a 
changing climate on mackerels are listed in  
Table 2.14.  In general, these fishes will be 
influenced by seawater temperature and the 
Kuroshio/Tsushima Warm Current in Korean waters.

Summary of the PICES Workshop on

A workshop entitled Linking Global Climate Model 
Output to (a) Trends in Commercial Species 
Productivity and (b) Changes in Broader Biological 
Communities in the World’s Oceans was convened 
on May 18, 2008, at the ICES/PICES/IOC 
International Symposium on the “Effects of Climate 
Change on the World’s Oceans” in Gijón, Spain.  
The workshop had the ultimate goal of facilitating a 
coordinated international research effort to forecast 
climate change impacts on the distribution and 
production of the world’s major fisheries, and on the 
biological communities in which these fisheries are 
embedded. It was attended by 33 people from 13 
nations (see Appendix 3.1) and there was consensus 
that this group could initiate a coordinated 
international collaboration to advance research in 
marine climate impacts.  Two originally proposed 
workshops entitled, “Linking Climate to Trends in 
Productivity of Key Commercial Species in the 
World’s Oceans” and “Screening Approaches and 
Linking Global Climate Model Output with 
Ecosystem and Population Models” were combined 
by the convenors because they were complementary.  
In retrospect, blending the two “schools” was 
fortuitous as it placed us in a better-than-expected 
position to initiate an effective international 
collaboration. 
 
The specific objectives were to:  
• review the activities of existing programs within 
each nation;  
• examine evidence for climate impacts on 
production of commercial fish species and other 
marine life;  
• discuss the feasibility of developing medium- to 
long-term forecasts of climate impacts;  
• discuss possible responses of commercial 
fisheries, human communities, and governments 
to climate-driven changes in marine life; and  
• identify common or standard approaches to 
forecasting climate change impacts on 
commercial species and marine communities and 
ecosystems.  
 
Workshop participants discussed climate scenarios to 
use in forecasting and the tools required for 
predicting climate impacts on commercial fish 
production and broader marine ecosystems.  The 
workshop provided a forum to discuss four 
components needed to complete the forecasts in a 
timely and coordinated fashion.  These included 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
scenarios, predictions of oceanographic impacts, 
modeling approaches, and regional scenarios for 
natural resource use and enhancement. The 
ecosystem component of the workshop surveyed a 
wide variety of approaches such as vulnerability 
assessments for informing location choices for 
ecosystem modeling efforts and management 
prioritization, trophodynamic fishery ecosystem 
modeling (i.e., Ecopath with Ecosim), climate 
envelope modeling, statistical approaches, and three- 
dimensional high-resolution biogeochemical 
ecosystem modeling (i.e., CCCC-NEMURO). 
 
The workshop began with an introduction by Anne 
Hollowed (U.S.A.) who proposed: (1) an overarching 
goal of producing quantitative estimates of climate 
change effects on the marine ecosystem – biology – 
in the next 5 years; (2) a review of all the related 
international efforts in a paper that would lay out a 
path for collaboration development; (3) initiation of a 
coordinated international effort — broader than one 
basin; and (4) production of a special journal issue 
for showcasing forecasting approaches that are 
available and are being developed. She discussed 
three broad approaches representing different levels 
of advancement in the science of climate impacts 
forecasting, listed in increasing order of 
sophistication: 
1. IPCC scenarios downscaled to local regions and 
ecosystem indicators used to project future fish 
production using detailed management strategy 
evaluations; 
2. IPCC scenarios downscaled to local regions and 
coupled to bio-physical models with higher 
trophic level feedbacks; 
3. Fully coupled bio-physical models that operate at 
time and space scales relevant to coastal domains. 
 
The main program of the workshop (Appendix 3.2) 
started with a round-table discussion of existing 
national or international projects developing 
forecasting initiatives, including Quest-FISH (Jason 
Holt), Fisheries and the Environment (FATE; Anne 
Hollowed), PICES’ Forecasting and Understanding 
Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific 
Marine Ecosystems (FUTURE; Michael Foreman), 
North Pacific Research Board Bering Sea Integrated 
Ecosystem Research Program (NPRB BSIERP; 
Clarence Pautzke), Climate Impacts on Oceanic Top 
Predators (CLIOTOP; Alistair Hobday), Ecosystem 
Studies of Sub-Arctic Seas (ESSAS; Harald Loeng), 
Evidencias e Impacto do Cambio Climático en Galicia 
(CLIGAL; Antonio Bode) and initiatives by the New 
Zealand Ministry of Fisheries (Mary Livingston).

The rest of the morning was devoted to eight 
presentations of projects that linked Global Climate 
Model (GCM) output to trends in commercial 
species productivity. 
 
Nicholas Bond (U.S.A.) presented “A method for 
using IPCC model simulations to project changes in 
marine ecosystems” in which he compared 
ensembles of hindcasted atmosphere–ocean model 
output to observed measurements, and used a tiered 
statistical approach to select a subset of models that 
performed well in representing regional oceano-
graphic projections.  This work indicated that 
different models have different strengths, so a 
particular question should use a tailored subset of 
models.  
 
Mary Livingston (New Zealand) presented “Climate 
change, oceanic response and possible effects on fish 
stocks in New Zealand waters” in which she 
described how climate change-related ecological 
trends have been equivocal in New Zealand during 
the last 50 years due to its oceanographic and 
ecological uniqueness and complexity and the 
paucity of long time series.  Some of New Zealand’s 
marine life might be quite vulnerable to climate and 
oceanographic changes due to a variety of factors, 
and thus there are plans to integrate climate impacts 
studies with marine fisheries research and 
management.   
 
Jae Bong Lee (Republic of Korea) presented 
“Forecasting climate change impacts on distribution 
and abundance of jack mackerel around Korean 
waters” in which he illustrated how variations in 
ocean conditions and warming of ocean water around 
Korea has influenced the distributions of jack 
mackerel in terms of their seasonal visitation to 
Korean waters from the East China Sea, and 
suggested that continued warming by 2100 may have 
considerable effects on these stocks around Korea.  
Future sea surface temperature, ocean drift and other 
oceanographic variables projected with GCMs will 
be incorporated into a stock projection model to 
forecast future production scenarios.   
 
Sukyung Kang (Republic of Korea) presented 
“Techniques for forecasting climate-induced 
variation in the distribution and abundance of 
mackerels in the Northwestern Pacific” in which she 
described an exploration of the positive relationship 
between mackerel production and warm ocean 
conditions and progress in forecasting the impact of 
climate change on mackerel production by 
downscaling forecasts of atmosphere–ocean 
conditions from GCMs to drive stock projection 
models. 
 
Adriaan Rijnsdorp (The Netherlands) presented 
“Effects of climate change on sole and plaice: 
Timing of spawning, length of the growth period and 
rate of growth” in which he reviewed how increased 
temperatures since 1989 in coastal nursery grounds 
in the southeastern North Sea has had a negative 
impact on plaice and a positive effect on sole thus 
causing a shifting species composition as their 
habitat quality changes. Implications of physiological 
trade-offs in this changing system will make 
forecasting challenging.  
 
Z. Teresa A’mar (U.S.A.) presented “The impact on 
management performance of including indicators of 
environmental variability in management strategies 
for the Gulf of Alaska walleye pollock fishery” in 
which she provided her management strategy 
evaluation (MSE) of the Gulf of Alaska walleye 
pollock fishery, with multiple indices of climate 
forcing incorporated into her overall modelling 
framework.  The best performing management 
strategies were ones that were more responsive to 
fluctuations in productivity due to environmental 
influences.  
 
Michael Schirripa (U.S.A.) presented “Simulation 
testing two methods of including environmental data 
into stock assessments” in which he described the 
development of environmental indicators of fish 
stock recruitment and provided both modelling and a 
statistical examples of how such indicators could be 
used in stock assessments and forecasting.  Sea 
surface height (SSH) was the best predictor of 
recruitment in this analysis, as low SSH occurs when 
the California Current and upwelling are both strong, 
and this is associated with high productivity.   
 
Alan Haynie (U.S.A.) presented “Climate change 
and changing fisher behavior in the Bering Sea 
pollock fishery” in which he discussed how 
fishermen will respond to changes in fish abundance 
driven by climate change, and that this will, in turn, 
have an impact on the ecosystem.  The fisheries we 
observe today result from current stock distributions, 
abundances, and prices — all of these will change 
with climate.  Spatial and market regulations that 
consider the relationship between fishermen and the 
95 
environment as the climate changes will be most 
effective. 
The morning session concluded with a discussion of 
the presentations and the outlook for forecasting 
commercial fisheries.  
 
Thomas Okey, Pew Fellow in Marine Conservation, 
introduced the afternoon session by providing a 
framework highlighting complementary modelling 
approaches that could be used to explore climate 
impacts on marine biota and ecosystems.  He 
described conceptual and qualitative models that are 
useful for proactive decision-making as a segue to 
the more quantitative approaches to linking GCM 
output to changes in broader marine communities. 
 
Jorge Sarmiento (U.S.A.) presented “Modeling 
response of ocean biology to climate warming using 
an empirical approach” in which he compared 
global warming simulations from six climate models 
and the physical changes projected for six ocean 
biomes.  All six models indicated increases in 
primary production at high latitudes, but the models 
did not agree with direction of change at mid-
latitudes. 
 
Taketo Hashioka (Japan) presented “Future 
ecosystem changes projected by a 3-D high-
resolution ecosystem model” in which he described 
efforts to develop a high-resolution ecosystem model 
by linking COCO (CCSR Ocean Component 
Models) to NEMURO and NEMURO.FISH models. 
Projections included a 30% decrease in the Kuroshio, 
10–30% decreases in Chl-a, a shift from diatoms to 
small phytoplankton, spring bloom 10 days earlier, 
decreases in phytoplankton biomass by 25%, and a 
2° shift in the distribution of sardines.  
 
William Cheung (Canada) presented a “Dynamic 
bio-climate envelope model to predict climate-
induced changes in distribution of marine fishes and 
invertebrates” in which he provided a global 
assessment of climate-induced range shifts of 1066 
commercial species throughout the world’s oceans 
from changing temperature, habitat characteristics, 
and other mediators of dispersal and range 
occupation.  
 
Alistair Hobday (Australia) presented “Informing 
location choices for ecosystem model development 
using a vulnerability index” as an Australian 
example of a quantitative vulnerability assessment 
that is used to identify the ecosystems, habitats, 
biological components, and human values most 
vulnerable to projected climate change so that 
climate impacts modelling and monitoring can be 
prioritized and targeted efficiently.  The CSIRO Mk 
3.5 model projections to 2070 provided indicators of 
climate change, while non-climate indicators were 
derived from other Australian data sets. 
 
Simone Libralato (Italy) presented “Towards the 
integration of biogeochemical and food web models 
for a comprehensive description of marine ecosystem 
dynamics” in which he reviewed the progress and 
outlooks for achieving end-to-end modelling (e.g., 
from viruses to fishes, from nutrients to fisheries, 
including climatic changes) by linking biogeo- 
chemical models with trophodynamic models.  He 
also summarized outcomes of the 2007 Trieste (Italy) 
workshop on “Biogeochemical processes and fish 
dynamics in food web models for end-to-end 
conceptualisation of marine ecosystems: theory and 
use of Ecopath with Ecosim”. 
 
Steven Mackinson (U.K.) presented “Which forcing 
factors fit? Using ecosystem models to investigate 
the relative influence of fishing and primary 
productivity on the dynamics of marine ecosystems” 
in which he described dynamic fitting with Ecopath 
with Ecosim models to identify the main driving 
forces of fish stocks and marine ecosystems (e.g., 
fishing mortalities or proxies of primary production), 
to assess the relative importance of these factors 
across regions, and to evaluate whether similar 
groups in different ecosystems respond similarly.   
 
Sheila Heymans (U.K.) presented “The effects of 
climate change on the northern Benguela ecosystem” 
in which she simulated the effect of global warming 
on the northern Benguela Current system by fitting a 
1956 Ecopath with Ecosim model to 2000 conditions 
and then simulating 50 years of sea surface 
temperature rise. The ecological effects were 
evaluated by indices of ecosystem function and 
commercial gain. 
 
The case studies presented during this workshop 
indicated the variety of approaches (and variations 
on similar approaches) for evaluating the impacts of 
climate change on marine life, biological 
communities, and ecosystem functions.  Although 
the approaches appeared to be coordinated within 
communities of modellers, coordination was lacking 
at the global level.  Most, if not all, of the presenters 
expressed the need to develop these approaches 
 
96 
further, and there appeared to be consensus among 
participants that an international collaboration would 
be a good way to do this.  A global coordination of 
teams and collaborators may prove to be a critical 
vehicle to use the increasingly refined physical and 
chemical projections from GCMs and regional 
models to evaluate impacts of climate change on the 
world’s marine fisheries and ecosystems.  The 
workshop described here may have been a key first 
step toward such a global collaboration.
