Executive Summary 
 
 
The Study Group on Marine Pollutants (SG-MP, 2011–2013) brought together participation and feedback 
from all six PICES member countries.  This report reflects the Terms of Reference established for the SG-MP 
in 2011.   
 
Following a kickoff workshop on “Pollutants in a changing ocean: Refining indicator approaches in support 
of coastal management” at PICES-2011 (Khabarovsk, Russia), the SG-MP has since convened a workshop on 
“Traditional seafoods of coastal aboriginal communities in the North Pacific” at PICES-2013 (Nanaimo, 
Canada) and two Topic Sessions on “Environmental contaminants in marine ecosystems: Seabirds and marine 
mammals as sentinels of ecosystem health” at PICES-2012 (Hiroshima, Japan) and “Status, trends and effects 
of pollutants in coastal ecosystems: Implications for wildlife and humans” at PICES-2013.   
 
Despite some variations in the priorities of member countries, there was broad agreement on a list of important 
marine pollution issues for the North Pacific Ocean.  The expressed support of multilateral groups with shared 
interests, including ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea), GESAMP (Group of Experts 
on Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution) and NOWPAP (Northwest Pacific Action Plan), provides a basis for 
collaborative efforts in the future.   
 
Based on SG-MP recommendations, a new Working Group on Emerging Topics in Marine Pollution was 
established to build on the foundation of past and current activities regarding marine pollution in the North 
Pacific.  This Working Group plans to convene several Topic Sessions and workshops at PICES Annual 
Meetings during 2014–2016, which is expected to lead to three special issues in international peer-reviewed 
journals, and to make a contribution to the next PICES North Pacific Ecosystem Status Report.

1 Introduction 
 
 
During a workshop on “Pollutants in a changing 
ocean: Refining indicator approaches in support of 
coastal management” held at PICES-2011 in 
Khabarovsk, Russia (see Appendices 8.4 and 8.5), 
participants recommended to the Marine Environmental 
Quality Committee (MEQ) that a Study Group on 
Marine Pollutants be established to identify 
opportunities for a revitalized PICES interest in this 
topic area.  The proposal was supported by MEQ 
and Science Board and subsequently approved by 
Governing Council.  In order to allow its parent 
committee, MEQ, time to re-align its Action Plan 
with PICES’ integrative science program, FUTURE, 
and for the SG-MP to follow suit for making 
recommendations, the mandate of the Study Group 
was extended in 2012 to a second year.  This report 
summarizes the discussions carried out by the SG-
MP in support of its Terms of Reference (Appendix 
8.1) during 2011–2013. 
 
Marine pollution is widely considered to be one of 
the main threats from human activities to the world’s 
oceans.  Contaminants may enter the ocean through 
direct, point source releases (ships, municipal waste 
water effluent, industrial discharges, and accidental 
spills), or through indirect, non-point source means 
(atmospheric deposition, river discharges, and 
terrestrial runoff).  
 
Some of the ‘hot topics’ pertaining to marine 
pollution in the North Pacific Ocean include: 
• Long-range transport and deposition of atmospheric 
pollutants, 
• Catastrophic and episodic pollutant releases, 
• Effects of climate change on pollutant transport, 
fate and effects, 
• Oil spills, oil and gas exploration, 
• Maritime transportation management (emissions, 
antifoulants, and ballast water), 
• Seafood safety (risk-benefit), 
• Biomagnification of pollutants in food webs, 
• Marine debris and  microplastics, 
• Aquaculture, 
• Radiation, 
• ‘Pathogen pollution’ from agricultural runoff and 
municipal waste effluent. 
 
While the term ‘contaminant’ describes the release 
of a substance from human activities into the 
environment, the term ‘pollutant’ is typically used 
when the contaminant impacts the health of biota or 
humans.  Since the ‘poison is in the dose’, the extent 
to which any one contaminant elicits adverse effects 
depends on the sensitivity of the organism in 
question and the concentration of the contaminant in 
its habitat. 
 
The use, release, and/or disposal of approximately 
100,000 chemicals on the global market has direct 
implications for the health of the world’s oceans 
since they represent the ultimate ‘sinks’ for 
anthropogenic pollutants.  While risk assessments 
and/or technical documentation provide decision 
makers in national governments with elementary 
chemical, physical, and toxicological information in 
support of national regulations, there is very little 
information on the fate and effects of chemicals in 
the marine environment.  This underscores the 
distinct need for research, and for information sharing, 
in the area of marine pollution in the North Pacific. 
 
While monitoring of specific contaminants entering 
the ocean typically reflects the need to assess the 
adequacy of regulations or compliance with discharge 
permits, research tends to be carried out by scientists 
in support of a management question, the needs of a 
granting agency, or a government priority.  However, 
curiosity has often created the impetus for research 
pursued by individual investigators. 
 
This report does not provide a comprehensive 
overview of all pollution issues that are relevant to 
the PICES community.  However, it does give input 
to the broader PICES community on: 
Introduction  Section 1   
2  PICES Scientific Report No. 46 
• some of the priority pollutants in the North 
Pacific Ocean as identified by scientists from 
PICES’ six member countries. 
• some of the promising indicator approaches or 
‘sentinel species’ that are being used within the 
PICES community, or elsewhere, and could be 
used more widely across PICES member 
countries. 
• some of the opportunities to share technical 
information on logistical, analytical, and/or field 
study methods in support of improved and/or 
standardized methodologies that could be used by 
all PICES member countries. 
 
Feedback from national representatives of the six 
PICES member countries (Appendix 8.2) throughout 
2011–2013 (Appendix 8.3) provided the basis for 
this document. Deliberations were used to answer 
the points above, and to identify activities and 
opportunities for PICES to build on its marine 
pollution capacity, alone or in partnership with 
select international organizations.  A framework 
document prepared prior to PICES-2012 in 
Hiroshima served as a basis for a one-day SG-MP 
meeting (see Appendix 8.4). Participants at this 
meeting strengthened and clarified the framework 
for the report, drafted and annotated final draft text 
for the report, and developed proposals for 
consideration by MEQ and Science Board.  Further 
discussions during 2012–2013 culminated in a final 
meeting at PICES-2013 in Nanaimo, Canada.  The 
ultimate objective of the SG-MP was to design a 
proposal (plan) for future PICES activities related to 
marine pollution.

2 Pollutant Priorities 
 
 
The diversity of contaminants entering the ocean 
from human activities makes it necessary to 
summarize and prioritize contaminants by broad 
category.  While SG-MP members from each PICES 
member country provided slightly divergent lists of 
top pollutant concerns, there was broad agreement 
on a basic list of common interests in the North 
Pacific Ocean.  There was also tacit recognition that 
contaminants are not measured in environmental 
matrices simply to describe their presence, absence, 
or trends but more importantly because they can 
present risks to the health of wildlife and/or humans. 
 
The evaluation of status, trends, and effects of 
different pollutants of concern in the North Pacific 
Ocean provides ecosystem-based information in 
support of chemical regulations, source control, 
seafood consumption guidelines or advisories, and 
fisheries management.  The ultimate goal of marine 
pollution research and monitoring is to reduce the 
release of pollutants that can affect commercial and 
recreational fisheries, endangered wildlife, and 
human health.  Major categories of pollutants in the 
North Pacific include the following. 
 
2.1 Persistent bioaccumulative and/or toxic 
contaminants  
Definition  
Persistent bioaccumulative and/or toxic (PBT) 
chemicals, consisting of both ‘legacy pollutants’ and 
‘emerging pollutants’, represent a group of 
substances that are not easily degraded, accumulate 
in organisms, and exhibit an acute or chronic 
toxicity.  They may, therefore, pose serious concerns 
for human and environmental health.  
Context  
Many PBT compounds are also semi-volatile, a 
property which permits these compounds to vaporise, 
undergo long-range transport through air and water, 
and finally deposit far from their point of release, 
such as a neighbouring country, the open ocean, 
polar regions, and alpine environments.  Because of 
these features, PBTs are considered a major global 
environmental concern.  While the Stockholm 
Convention facilitated the development of national 
regulations which have reduced the concentrations 
of many ‘legacy’ pollutants, the persistence of these 
pollutants means that many continue to present risks 
to biota.  Research is also needed to document the 
trends and effects of many unregulated ‘emerging 
pollutants’. PICES member countries will all benefit 
from an ocean-wide approach to examine priority 
marine pollutants. 
Relevance  
Contamination of the marine environment by PBT 
substances degrades the integrity of valuable 
ecosystem components and threatens seafood safety. 
PBT substances have been shown to accumulate in 
abiotic matrices in coastal areas adjacent to sources, 
amplify in high trophic level organisms (some fish, 
seabirds and marine mammals), and in commercially 
available invertebrates and fish. The accumulation of 
PBT substances in marine organisms has been 
shown to cause mutation, cancer, endocrine disruption, 
immunosuppression and developmental abnormalities. 
Study in the Pacific region  
Monitoring of PBT substances in coastal environments 
is carried out by individual nations, with few 
examples of information sharing or international 
cooperation in the North Pacific Ocean.  
 
Important PBT pollutants of concern identified by 
SG-MP members were:  
• Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 
• Organochlorine pesticides, 
• Dioxins/furans, 
• Organic flame retardants (PBDEs, HBCD), 
• Perfluorinated compounds, 
• Current-use pesticides and formulants, 
Pollutant Priorities  Section 2 
4  PICES Scientific Report No. 46 
• Antifoulants (organotins, creosote, wood preser-
vatives, copper, zinc pyrithione, irgarol), 
• Pharmaceuticals and personal care products 
(PPCPs).   
 
2.2 Hydrocarbons  
Definition  
Organic compounds are comprised of hydrogen and 
carbon, and usually do not contain an oxygen atom. 
Hydrocarbons are classified into two main groups 
according to chemical structure: aliphatics and 
aromatics.  
Context  
Hydrocarbons are the primary components of 
petroleum such as crude oil and fuel, sometimes 
derived from coal.  Alkane, the main aliphatic 
hydrocarbon, is very abundant in petroleum and 
susceptible to microbial degradation in marine 
environments. There are fewer aromatic hydrocarbons 
than aliphatics in petroleum. However, aromatic 
hydrocarbons are more resistant to microbial 
degradation such that some recalcitrant aromatic 
hydrocarbons remain in marine environments for 
prolonged periods of time.  There are two groups of 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) according 
to their origins: petrogenic and pyrogenic. 
Hydrocarbon contamination in marine environments 
is considered an index of human activity. PAHs are 
regarded as mid- or long-range (trans-boundary) 
transport air pollutants. 
Relevance 
Some aromatic hydrocarbons are known to exert 
adverse effects in aquatic biota, and some high 
molecular weight PAHs such as benzo(a)pyrene are 
known to be potent carcinogens.  Concentrations of 
PAHs in sediments can readily exceed sediment 
quality guidelines near industrial centers (e.g., 
harbours, sewage outfalls, steel works, and 
petroleum refineries). 
Study in the Pacific region:  
PAHs are studied in some locations by PICES 
member countries, but there exist no multi-national 
or international monitoring networks or programs in 
the North Pacific region.  PAH measurements are 
carried out following oil spills.  
 
A number of approaches to measuring the thousands 
of naturally-occurring and anthropogenic PAHs 
exist, but Study Group members categorized the 
determination of PAHs as follows: 
• Pyrogenic and petrogenic PAHs (e.g., 16 U.S. 
EPA PAHs and alkylated PAHs), 
• Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) as a bulk 
indicator during spills. 
 
2.3 Metals or elements of concern  
Definition  
A number of elements have been identified that may 
pose risks to the health of marine biota or humans.  
These include metals such as mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) 
and cadmium (Cd), which occur naturally in marine 
food webs but can reach harmful levels through both 
natural processes (e.g., Cd in shellfish due to 
geology and upwelling; methyl-Hg in high trophic 
level biota from biomagnification) and human 
activities (e.g., Hg due to release from coal-fired 
generating stations). 
Context  
Metals/elements.  
Relevance  
High levels of certain elements can present a risk to 
some wildlife and humans. Depending on the 
element, these risks can be attributed to point 
sources or activities, feeding ecology (e.g., filter-
feeders which can concentrate some elements), 
specific tissues (some elements are concentrated in 
the liver or other organs), or high trophic levels 
(such as the amplification of methyl-Hg in marine 
food webs). 
Study in the Pacific region 
Important elements of concern identified by Study 
Group members were:  
• Mercury (Hg) and methyl-Hg, 
• Lead (Pb), 
• Cadmium (Cd), 
• Radionuclides.

PICES Scientific Report No. 46  5 
2.4 Microplastics and marine debris 
Definition  
These ‘structural pollutants’ may be defined as any 
manufactured or processed solid waste material 
(typically inert) that enters the marine environment 
from any source (marine litter, floatables) (Coe and 
Rogers, 1997).  Microplastics are small plastic 
marine debris less than 1 or 5 mm in size (depending 
on criteria for size definition).  Microplastics are 
either intentionally manufactured (‘primary 
microplastics’, e.g., pellets, scrubbers, and abrasives) 
or result from the breakdown of larger items 
(‘secondary microplastics’, e.g., plastic fragments, 
fibers and sheets). 
Context  
Marine debris, especially microplastics, is a global 
concern, as it transcends national boundaries and can 
lead to trans-Pacific movement.  Plastic debris in the 
ocean is persistent and is expected to last for 
hundreds of years.  The global production of plastics 
is increasing, suggesting that the North Pacific may 
face increasing pressures from plastic pollution. 
Relevance  
Marine debris causes direct adverse effects on a 
variety of marine animals (seabirds, marine 
mammals, sea turtles, and fish) by entanglement and 
ingestion.  While ‘macroplastics’ can cause obvious 
and lethal effects, microplastics present a more 
poorly understood risk to biota.  Microplastics may 
be ingested and may contain absorbed toxic 
chemicals and additives.  There is increasing 
evidence of the occurrence of microplastics in 
various marine animals, from invertebrates to marine 
mammals, including seafood stuffs (mussel, crab 
and fish stomachs).  In addition, marine debris can 
transport non-indigenous species across the ocean. 
Marine debris, including microplastics, currently 
causes visible and tangible socio-economic impacts 
by affecting tourism, the fisheries industry, maritime 
safety, and ecosystem services. 
Study in the Pacific region  
The identification of the ‘North Pacific Garbage 
Patch’ highlights the pan-Pacific nature of this 
problem.  There are increasing numbers of reports 
about marine debris in coastal areas of the Pacific, 
but few documenting microplastics.  There exist no 
multi-lateral or international efforts to document or 
track marine debris or microplastics trends or effects 
in the North Pacific Ocean. 
 
2.5 Biological pollution  
Definition  
Because of the high population density in some parts 
of the North Pacific Rim, coastal environments face 
a variety of pollution problems involving marine 
organisms, e.g., bacteria contamination which is 
mostly caused by fecal coliform, and harmful algal 
blooms caused by eutrophication which may lead to 
human health risk by shellfish toxins.  
Context  
Fecal coliform is commonly used as an indicator of 
fecal contamination, more specifically of E. coli 
which is an indicator microorganism for other 
pathogens that may be present in feces.  
 
Eutrohpication is caused mainly by excess nutrients, 
with the two most important kinds being nitrogen 
and phosphorus.  
 
In shellfish, five groups of toxins have been 
distinguished: paralytic shellfish toxins causing 
paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), diarrhetic 
shellfish toxins causing diarrhetic shellfish 
poisoning (DSP), amnesic shellfish toxins causing 
amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), neurotoxic 
shellfish toxins causing neurotoxic shellfish 
poisoning (NSP), and azaspiracid shellfish toxins 
causing azaspiracid shellfish poisoning (AZP).  All 
these toxins have been recorded to cause mortality in 
people consuming shellfish.  
Relevance  
High concentrations of fecal coliform can harm 
marine environments and the human dimension (e.g., 
aquaculture, recreational beaches).  Large quantities 
of fecal coliform bacteria in coastal areas, especially 
in bathing areas and coastal resorts, may indicate a 
higher risk of pathogens being present in the 
waterbody.  Some waterborne pathogenic diseases 
that may coincide with fecal coliform contamination 
include ear infections, dysentery, typhoid fever, viral 
and bacterial gastroenteritis, and hepatitis A.  The 
Pollutant Priorities  Section 2 
6  PICES Scientific Report No. 46 
presence of fecal coliform tends to affect humans 
more than it does aquatic organisms, though not 
exclusively.  Therefore, it is a compulsory indicator 
monitored for beach and coastal recreation areas.  
 
Although nutrients are essential for organisms to live, 
too much in the ocean, especially in the coastal area, 
e.g., a bay, can cause some problems.  In the North 
Pacific Rim, excess amounts of nitrogen and 
phosphorus are the main cause of the poor health of 
the oceans, e.g., eutrophication or algal blooms. 
Some species of harmful algal blooms can produce 
shellfish toxins, which can not only do harm to 
marine biota, e.g., mussels, scallops, crabs, and fish 
but can also pose a risk to human health via the 
seafood containing the toxins, resulting in adverse 
social and economic effects for coastal communities. 
Study in the Pacific region  
In the PICES member countries, fecal coliform has 
to be monitored in bathing areas and coastal 
recreational areas.  Nutrients, especially nitrogen 
and phosphorus, are the most important items for the 
regular monitoring program, and shellfish toxins 
have to be assayed to ensure the safety of seafood. 
Biological pollutants of potential concern include: 
• Fecal coliform, 
• Nutrients, 
• Shellfish toxins. 
 
  
Section 3  Pollutant Indicators  
PICES Scientific Report No. 46  7 
 
 
 
3 Pollutant Indicators  
 
 
Indicators of pollution represent approaches to 
pollution research and monitoring that are practical, 
relevant, scientifically defensible, and cost-effective. 
The choice of indicator varies with the pollutant(s) 
being targeted.  They can provide an effective 
integrated message to managers (e.g., response to 
regulations, source control, remediation, risk-based 
evaluation of seafood safety, general ecosystem 
indicators).  While a variety of matrices supply 
measures of environmental contamination (air, water, 
sediments), indicators give broader context, e.g., 
toxicological, physiological, ecological, health. SG-
MP members reviewed some of the indicator 
approaches that are being used in some countries, 
but could also be applied more broadly in support of 
data sharing in PICES. 
 
3.1 Status and trends of pollutants over space 
and time 
 
Water is both a route of exposure to organisms and a 
transport pathway for pollutants.  As a matrix or 
medium, water can be limited due to the dilution of, 
for example, hydrophobic pollutants, leading to low 
concentrations and analytical challenges.  Recent 
studies of both persistent organic contaminants and 
specific current-use pesticides have reported net 
deposition to the North Pacific (Ding et al., 2007; 
Cai et al., 2012). 
 
Sediments are habitat for infauna and other benthic 
organisms, a sink/reservoir for many pollutants, and 
a route of exposure.  Sediments are valuable for 
indicating both recent localized accumulation of 
contaminants, and through use of cores, temporal 
trends from long-term deposition.  Sediments have 
been used to demonstrate the increased deposition of 
PAHs to the East China Sea (Guo et al., 2006). 
Sediment cores have shown the long-term history of 
PCB and PBDE contamination to the Salish Sea 
(Johannessen et al., 2008). 
 
Air is a pathway of dispersion and transport as well 
as a potential route of exposure for many pollutants. 
Air sampling is valuable for documenting episodic 
events due to fast dispersion and transport time and 
short sampling periods.  Recent examples have 
documented outflow of organic pollutants from 
sources in Asia and deposition to the North Pacific 
(Primbs et al., 2007) or to the Arctic.  
 
Shellfish are effective accumulators and integrators 
of pollutants adhered to particles suspended and 
transported in the water column.  Therefore, they 
indicate specific particle-bound pollutants such as 
PAHs, other organic pollutants, and heavy metals. 
Recent studies have made effective use of mussels 
and other shellfish to show temporal trends of heavy 
metals in coastal and open waters of the Northwest 
Pacific (Kavun et al., 2002; Kovekovdova et al., 2006). 
 
Marine mammals are often long-lived top predators, 
with large habitat needs and can, therefore, serve as 
sentinels of marine food web contamination (Ross et 
al., 2000).  Recent studies of harbour seals have 
revealed declining temporal trends in a number of 
flame retardant contaminants, reflecting response to 
regulations (Ross et al., 2013).  
 
Seabirds are widely distributed, feeding on a range 
of marine organisms from zooplankton to fish, and 
so can effectively sample pollutant accumulation in 
different components of the marine environment. 
They can also be active biotransporters of pollutants. 
A variety of recent studies have reported temporal 
and spatial trends of organic pollutants and heavy 
metals in marine birds from the North Pacific 
(Harris et al., 2003; Ueno et al., 2003; Finklestein et 
al., 2006).  
 
Fish, due to their biodiversity and economic value, 
contribute extensively to marine ecosystem services. 
Fish integrate contaminants over the full range of 
benthic to pelagic compartments and can act as 
biotransport vectors from marine to terrestrial 
ecosystems.  Many recent studies have used fish as 
bioindicators of organic and inorganic pollutants 
(Boyarova et al., 2004; Cullon et al., 2009; 
Lukyanova, 2013).  
Pollutant Indicators  Section 3 
8  PICES Scientific Report No. 46 
    
Benthos, such as polychaetes or crustaceans, 
accumulate pollutants mainly from detritus in 
sediments.  Thus, they indicate/reflect the pollution 
in sediments. They are also important in benthic–
pelagic coupling processes through being eaten by 
other marine organisms such as flatfish.  
 
Seaweeds accumulate heavy metals effectively in 
their cell walls and can be used for site-specific 
monitoring of local contamination from mining and 
other natural and anthropogenic sources (Khristoforova 
and Kozhenkova, 2002; Khristoforova and Chernova, 
2005; Kozhenkova et al., 2012).  
 
Microplastics are plastic particles from industrial 
feed stock for plastic products or degraded plastics 
discharged along with human activities.  Although 
they are considered as pollutants themselves, their 
persistence in the marine environment and their 
capacity to attract hydrophobic pollutants enable 
them to serve as an indicator of pollutant transfer in 
the North Pacific.  Recent studies demonstrate the 
ability to monitor PCBs, DDTs, and HCHs 
worldwide, including the North Pacific (Ogata et al., 
2009; Andrady, 2011). 
 
3.2 Pollutant-related risks and effects in biota 
 
Evidence of specific effects of contaminants from 
subtle early-warning molecular responses to 
population- or community-level impacts leading to 
loss of ecosystem stability, productivity, diversity, 
and other services include the following.  
 
Shellfish have been extensively used in, for example, 
Mussel Watch programs to test for levels of both 
pollutants and endpoints such as metabolic 
disturbances, e.g., oxidative stress, and formation of 
DNA adducts (Choi et al., 2010; Lukyanova et al., 
2009).  
 
Marine mammals have some of the highest levels of 
persistent contaminants found in the world’s animals. 
While the complex contaminant mixtures to which 
marine mammals are exposed make it difficult to 
identify effects attributed to single chemicals, 
carefully controlled studies have observed PCB-
related effects in free-ranging harbour seals, ringed 
seals and killer whales using cellular and molecular 
techniques (Mos et al., 2006; Routti et al., 2010; 
Buckman et al., 2011). Life history-based modelling 
techniques have described the PCB risks to long-
lived marine mammals wherein killer whales from 
the Northeast Pacific will not be ‘protected’ from the 
adverse effects of PCBs until the end of the 21
st
 
Century (Hickie et al., 2007). 
 
Seabirds and aquatic counterparts have been widely 
used to study the effects of persistent bio-
accumulative and toxic (PBT) compounds on biota. 
Endpoints investigated range from molecular 
biomarkers such as induction of specific P450 
enzymes to critical life history parameters, 
reproduction and survival, and even population 
stability (Sanderson et al., 1994; Harris et al., 2003). 
 
Fish, especially flatfish, given their ecologic and 
commercial importance, have been extensively 
researched for the effects of pollutants.  Endpoints 
include molecular biomarkers, neoplasia, endocrine 
disruption, reproduction, survival and population 
stability, including commercially important species, 
and subsequent impacts on fisheries and coastal 
communities.  
 
Benthos have been used extensively to assess the 
extent of organically rich conditions.  For example, 
specific polychaete species become abundant in such 
conditions.  In meiobenthic communities, copepods 
are more vulnerable than nematodes to low oxygen 
and higher concentration of PCBs. 
 
3.3 Pollutant-related risks and effects in humans  
 
The North Pacific supplies food for many people, 
with coastal and aboriginal communities relying on 
seafood much more heavily than other segments of 
the population. While seafoods provide an important 
source of nutrients, they also represent a dietary 
source of contaminants of potential concern.  This 
implies the need for an evaluation of both risks and 
benefits associated with the various foods consumed. 
Protecting these aquatic foods from contamination is 
in the best interest of people or populations that 
depend heavily on fish and other seafood. 
 
The general population  
While contaminants (notably those with PBT 
properties) are found in all foods, aquatic foods can 
have higher contaminant concentrations compared to 
terrestrial foods.  This is due to the preferential 
partitioning into the lipids of aquatic food webs and 
the food web-based amplification of many persistent 
contaminants.  Studies have documented adverse 
Section 3  Pollutant Indicators 
PICES Scientific Report No. 46  9 
effects in humans, but typically such reports have 
been limited to occupation and/or accidental 
exposures.  
 
Vulnerable communities or segments of the population 
Some segments of the general population or some 
communities are at increased risk of heightened 
exposure to persistent contaminants.  Neonates are 
typically exposed to higher levels of persistent 
contaminants than adults at a time when they are 
most sensitive.  Studies have found that PCBs and 
related compounds are associated with ‘small for 
gestational age’ at birth, disruption of endocrine 
systems, reduced immune function, lasting spatio-
motoral skills deficits, and reduced I.Q. in the more 
exposed individuals (Koopman-Esseboom et al., 
1996, 1997).  In addition, some communities with 
individuals who consume large quantities of 
seafoods have been shown to be more contaminated 
and to exhibit increased frequencies of adverse 
health outcomes (Jacobson and Jacobson, 1996). 
These communities can include coastal populations, 
sportfishers, recreational fishers, and immigrant 
communities. 
 
Aboriginal communities 
The surprising discovery in the 1980s that Canada’s 
Inuit people in the Far North were some of the 
world’s most contaminated people underscored the 
capacity of chemicals to undergo long-range 
transport and the special vulnerability of people who 
consume large quantities of fish and marine 
mammals (Dewailly et al., 1989).

PICES Scientific Report No. 46  11 
 
 
 
4 Method Development, Sharing and Inter-calibration for Marine 
Pollution Research and Monitoring: Opportunities for PICES  
 
 
4.1 Analytical techniques 
 
There exists a variety of means of detecting and 
quantifying trace amounts of chemicals, biological 
markers and measures of individual or population 
health.  However, there is an urgent need to improve 
comparability across studies and laboratories.  Some 
examples where such a need is evident include: 
• Standardized methods to characterize and quantify 
microplastics, 
• Inter-laboratory calibration exercises for chemical 
analysis, 
• Sediment chemistry normalization techniques, 
• Hydrocarbon fingerprinting, 
• Biomarkers for exposure and effect (e.g., 
imposex from organotins, endocrine disruption in 
fish and wildlife), 
• Pathogen identification (biological pollution, 
bacterial source tracking), 
• New approaches to considering the cumulative 
risks associated with complex mixtures (humans 
and wildlife). 
4.2  Study designs 
 
There exists a variety of field methodologies, survey 
designs or sampling regimes that generate new 
insight into ocean pollution.  However, there is a 
distinct need to adopt Pacific-wide approaches in 
order to improve comparability of results, as well as 
new approaches to evaluating the cumulative 
impacts of pollution: 
• New risk assessment approaches for wildlife 
using data from environmental media (water, 
sediment, prey), 
• A North Pacific monitoring program (e.g., 
International Pellet Watch, U.S. Mussel Watch, 
passive air and water samplers, seabird eggs and 
feathers, marine mammal blubber), 
• Sampling of marine mammals and seabirds using 
non-destructive techniques, 
• Looking at confounding factors in study design 
and how to avoid them, 
• Improvement of ship-based sampling techniques, 
especially air, 
• Development of a rapid response strategy 
(equipment, personnel, protocol). 
  
 
   
 
  
Section 5  Collaborative Opportunities 
PICES Scientific Report No. 46  13 
 
 
 
5 Collaborative Opportunities with Other International 
Organizations  
 
 
Two international organizations, ICES (International 
Council on the Exploration of the Sea) and GESAMP 
(Group of Experts on the Study and Assessment of 
Marine Pollution) have thus far indicated an interest 
in the outcomes of the SG-MP. NOWPAP (Northwest 
Action Plan) has also shown an interest in possible 
collaboration. Joint activities (topic sessions, workshops, 
inter-laboratory calibration exercises, and integrated 
assessments) between PICES and other organizations 
will provide leveraging and added value.  Current 
expert groups and activities on marine pollution for 
ICES include: 
• WG on Marine Litter (WG-ML; proposed for 2014),  
• WG on Biological Effects of Contaminants (WGBEC),  
• WG on Marine Chemistry  (MCWG),  
• WG on Marine Sediments (WGMS), 
• WG on Pathogens and Diseases of Marine 
Organisms (WGDMO), 
• SCICOM Steering Group on Human Impacts on 
the Environment (SSGHIE), 
• Integrated assessments on ecosystems (5 regional 
WGs),  
GESAMP provides independent assessment of global 
datasets, advising the UN and sponsors, and identifying 
new and emerging chemicals (foresight). GESAMP 
efforts usually involve expert groups in a 3-year term. 
These currently include: 
• WG 1: EHS Working Group (evaluating the transport 
of hazardous substances), 
• WG 34 on Ballast Water, 
• WG 37 on Mercury and Its Compounds (metal 
inputs, distribution and fate, particularly Hg), 
• WG 38 on Atmospheric Input of Chemicals to the 
Ocean (open ocean; nutrients, dust and iron; ship 
emissions; CO
2
 drawdown/acidification), 
• WG 39 on Global Trends in Pollution of Coastal 
Ecosystems (history of ocean pollution through 
sediment cores (IAEA dated cores; may expand to 
corals, mussels, etc. using laser ablation), 
• WG 40 on Sources, Fate and Effects of Micro-
plastics in the Marine Environment – A Global 
Assessment.

6 Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
 
While the SG-MP pondered some of the many 
pollution concerns in the North Pacific, the members 
concluded that it would be worth targeting a few 
selected topics for examination.  In this light, the 
SG-MP proposed to establish a new Expert Group 
on Emerging Topics in Marine Pollution (EG-ETMP) 
in order to provide leadership on this topic in PICES 
by convening a series of Topic Sessions and 
workshops, by organizing special issues in 
international peer-reviewed journals, and by 
contributing to the next PICES North Pacific 
Ecosystem Status Report.  The active engagement of 
all six PICES member countries throughout the two 
years of activities convened by the SG-MP suggests 
that there exists broad support for this new Expert 
Group, the proposal of which is provided below. 
 
General objectives 
 
Pollution can adversely affect the health and 
abundance of marine biota, especially in densely-
populated coastal areas.  The downstream socio-
economic consequences can be significant, with 
numerous examples of consumption advisories, 
commercial fishery closures, commercial trade 
interdictions and diminished aboriginal access to 
food resources around the North Pacific Ocean.  The 
protection of ecosystem health and services requires 
an ability to detect emerging pollutant issues before 
serious adverse impacts arise.  Regulations, policies 
and other management actions resulting from marine 
pollution research in the past have led to dramatic 
declines in environmental concentrations of a number 
of harmful pollutants, subsequently improving the 
health of marine biota.  
 
The proposed EG-ETMP will provide leadership on 
emerging pollution issues to the PICES community, 
reporting through the MEQ Committee.  The group 
will convene a series of timely Topics Sessions and 
workshops, and coordinate special issues in 
international peer-reviewed journals.  The EG-
ETMP will ensure the continued availability of 
expertise on marine pollutants within PICES, and 
deliver guidance to the FUTURE Advisory Panels 
(notably AP-AICE and AP-SOFE).  The group will 
collaborate with other PICES expert groups in co-
convening activities or compiling data.  Importantly, 
the proposed EG will address the question identified 
in the FUTURE Science Plan “How do human 
activities affect coastal ecosystems and how are 
societies affected by changes in these ecosystems?”  
 
Terms of Reference 
 
1. Document and profile emerging marine pollution 
issues in the North Pacific Ocean within the 
PICES community by:

report summarizing results of Expert Group 
deliberations.
 
 
  
Conclusions and Recommendations  Section 6 
16  PICES Scientific Report No. 46 
Proposed activities 2014–2016  
 
The Expert Group on Emerging Topics in Marine 
Pollution will engage in specific activities that will 
identify contaminants of emerging concern, 
prioritize pollutants from the many sources, and 
assess the relative importance of pollutants among 
other natural and anthropogenic stressors.  Members 
will contribute to discussions and strategic planning 
with the MEQ Committee as well as through other 
PICES expert groups.  The proposed group will 
build on the success of a number of activities carried 
out by the SG-MP, including two workshops (2011, 
Khabarovsk: Pollutants in a changing ocean: 
Refining indicator approaches in support of coastal 
management and 2013, Nanaimo: Traditional 
seafoods of coastal aboriginal communities in the 
North Pacific: Insight into food, social and 
ceremonial uses at Snuneymux’w First Nation in 
Nanaimo, British Columbia) and two Topic Sessions 
(2012, Hiroshima: Environmental contaminants in 
marine ecosystems: Seabirds and marine mammals 
as sentinels of ecosystem health; 2013, Nanaimo: 
Status, trends and effects of pollutants in coastal 
ecosystems: Implications for wildlife and humans). 
The proposal for establishing this Expert Group will 
benefit from the current support of ICES and 
GESAMP.

next North Pacific Ecosystem Status Report. 
 
The Expert Group will directly address the following 
questions of the FUTURE program: 
3. How do human activities affect coastal ecosystems 
and how are societies affected by changes in these 
ecosystems? 
3.1 What are the dominant anthropogenic pressures 
in coastal marine ecosystems and how are they 
changing?  
• By characterizing emerging pollution priorities in 
the North Pacific Ocean. 
 
3.2 How are these anthropogenic pressures and 
climate forcings, including sea level rise, affecting 
nearshore and coastal ecosystems and their inter-
actions with offshore and terrestrial systems? 
• By documenting the impacts of emerging 
pollutants in the North Pacific Ocean, especially 
in coastal environments, and in a changing ocean 
environment. 
 
3.3 How do multiple anthropogenic stressors interact 
to alter the structure and function of the systems, and 
what are the cumulative effects? 
• By collaborating with other expert groups to 
document importance of marine pollution relative 
to multiple stressors.  
 
3.4 What will be the consequences of projected 
coastal ecosystem changes and what is the 
predictability and uncertainty of forecasted changes? 
• By developing approaches to pollutant indicators 
that account for climate variability and change. 
Section 6  Conclusions and Recommendations 
PICES Scientific Report No. 46  17 
• By characterizing changing pollution risks as 
climate changes. 
 
3.5 How can we effectively use our understanding 
of coastal ecosystem processes and mechanisms to 
identify the nature and causes of ecosystem changes 
and to develop strategies for sustainable use? 
• By prioritizing pollutant sources and types in 
support of source control, regulations and best 
practices. 
• By translating compiled data and findings 
through the PICES North Pacific Ecosystem 
Status Report to formats that are understandable 
to the general public and a wider audience.

8.1 Study Group on Marine Pollutants Terms of Reference  
 
 
Statement of Purpose 
 
The purpose of the Study Group on Marine Pollutants (SG-MP) is to identify novel or promising approaches 
to monitoring pollutant trends over space and time, and to evaluate impacts on biota at the population level.  
The Study Group will establish a list of priority substances and pollutant indicators in PICES member 
countries using a series of case studies (e.g., microplastics in seawater, seabird egg monitoring for persistent 
organic pollutants (POPs) over time; risk-based ranking of complex pollutant mixtures in sediments).  This 
will help identify those methods or approaches that would benefit from harmonization (e.g., characterization of 
heterogeneous microplastic content in seawater or biota), and improve data delivery and scientific advice to 
managers and stakeholders. 
 
While the SG-MP will focus on impacts to biota, linkages will be established with those efforts that describe 
socio-economic impacts of pollution (e.g., fisheries closures, consumption guidelines, impacts on endangered 
species, special vulnerability of coastal and indigenous peoples).  Input from regional and international bodies 
such as ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea), GESAMP (Joint Group of Experts on the 
Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection) and NOWPAP (Northwest Pacific Action Plan), will 
increase efficiencies and the scientific value of the SG-MP outcome. 
 
The establishment of the SG-MP is consistent with the FUTURE Science Plan component 3 (How do human 
activities affect coastal ecosystems and how are societies affected by changes in these ecosystems?), and 
contributes insight into the structure, function and resilience of ecosystems as in components 1 and 2.  This 
will allow a critical evaluation of highly complex pollutant mixtures, clarify priority concerns in the North 
Pacific, and provide a platform to assess the relative importance of pollutants compared to other stressors. 
 
Terms of Reference  
 
1. Identify novel or promising approaches to operational marine pollution assessment in PICES member 
countries by:  
 a. establishing a list of priority pollutant concerns for each of the PICES member countries;  
 b. identifying useful indicators of status, trends and effects; and  
 c. identifying those issues or methods that would benefit from harmonization.  
2. Identify interactions within PICES scientific committees and expert groups that will complement the Study 
Group and will be consistent with the ecosystem approach espoused by FUTURE.  
3. Explore potential partnerships with other professional or multilateral organizations (e.g., ICES, GESAMP, 
NOWPAP) which could lead to joint activities (working group, sessions, publications), improve 
efficiencies and strengthen scientific outcomes.  
4. Develop recommendations for a possible PICES expert group on marine pollutants.

Pollutants in a changing ocean: Refining indicator approaches in support of coastal management 
 
October 14, 2011 
 
Co-sponsored by: GESAMP, ICES and IOC 
 
Co-Convenors: Kris Cooreman (ICES/Belgium), Peter Kershaw (GESAMP/UK), Olga Lukyanova 
(PICES/Russia) and Peter Ross (PICES/Canada) 
 
Background 
 
Many anthropogenic pollutants impact marine environmental quality, with coastal zones being particularly 
vulnerable. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a concern because they magnify in food webs and present 
health risks to humans and wildlife.  Other chemicals are less persistent, but may nonetheless impact the health 
of biota.  While some pollution indicators are ensconced into monitoring and management regimes in different 
nations over space and time, new pollutant concerns may not yet be captured by existing protocols.  These 
include “micro-plastics”, the breakdown products of debris and other forms of structural pollutants, which can 
clog the gills of invertebrates and fish, and asphyxiate seabirds and marine mammals.  In addition, these micro-
plastics may adsorb some of the other chemical contaminants and transfer them to marine organisms.  This 
workshop reviewed ways in which chemical and structural pollutants enter the marine environment, are 
transported through ocean currents and/or biological transport, and impact marine biota.  The workshop 
reviewed several examples of pollution indicators used by different nations, as a basis for improving and/or 
expanding indicator approaches in the North Pacific Ocean.  These examples also critically evaluate the extent 
to which changing baselines (e.g., climate variability) may impact on source/transport/fate processes and 
effects on biota, and recommend means of improving the utility and reliability of current indicator/ monitoring 
approaches in a changing world.   
 
The objectives of this workshop were to: 
(1) Critically review 3–5 examples of currently used indicators of marine contamination in different PICES 
member countries (e.g., shellfish monitoring of PAHs, metals, persistent organic pollutants, fecal bacteria; 
POPs in seabird eggs and marine mammals); list advantages and disadvantages for each, and describe 
management/policy linkages; Consider the influence of changing climate on indicator performance and ways 
to address this. 
(2) Review emergent pollutant concerns and in particular, examine the topic of plastics and micro-plastics as 
structural pollutants and as mechanisms for the transfer of contaminants to marine biota; examine existing 
and/or new opportunities to establish indicator approaches to plastic pollution, and review sampling and 
analytical methods. 
(3) From these applied examples/case studies, identify opportunities for future PICES activities on the topic of 
marine pollution: 
 evaluate feasibility of establishing Study Group on Marine Contaminants, including terms of reference, 
membership, and deliverables; 
 describe the scope of PICES/FUTURE activities that focus on contaminants in the North Pacific marine 
environment; 
Section 8  Appendices 
PICES Scientific Report No. 46  29 
 update and revise MEQ Action Plan elements on marine contaminants; 
 identify potential interactions with IOC/ICES/GESAMP/NOWPAP/NOAA programs that focus on 
contaminants in the marine environment. 
 
Summary of Workshop 
 
Dr. Peter Kershaw (United Kingdom) described the mandate and activities of the United Nations-sponsored 
Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP), which 
provides expert advice on priority topics, as well as assessments of regional and global environmental concerns. 
One activity that is relevant to PICES is the GESAMP effort to identify pollution indicators for the United 
Nations Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme (TWAP) in groundwater, rivers, lakes, Large Marine 
Ecosystems (LMEs) and open oceans.  In addition, GESAMP has a number of Working Groups that are active 
in relevant areas, including ‘mercury, cadmium and lead’ (WG37), ‘the historical inputs of contaminants into 
coastal ecosystems’ (WG39), ‘source, fate and effects of micro-plastics in the marine environment’ (WG40). 
In addition, a new Correspondence Group is being established to evaluate the ‘biomagnification of pollutants 
in top predators’.  
 
Dr. Kris Cooreman (Belgium) described the aim within the ICES realm for integrated science in support of 
management. Dr Cooreman stressed that fisheries regulations were ineffectual when the root causes of reduced 
fish stocks are unrelated to fishing.  In addition to a recent example of a population-level impact related to a 
single chemical (the antifoulant tributyltin and reduced shrimp stocks), other European examples include the 
effects of PCBs and DDT on reproduction and health of seabirds and marine mammals.  A long history of 
interest in the area of marine pollution positions ICES well to partner with PICES on subjects of mutual 
interest into the future. 
 
Dr. Joel Baker (USA) led discussions and activities on the topic of micro-plastics, which provided a basis for 
the field trip on the Amur River the following day.  This pollutant category encompasses a wide variety of 
types, sizes, shapes, colours and origins for ‘structural pollutants’, highlighting the need for improved 
standardization of assessment methods.  Major challenges, and hence opportunities for collaboration in the 
North Pacific, include: methods to detect and quantify, distribution over space, and effects on biota (including 
invertebrates, fish, turtles, seabirds and marine mammals). 
 
Dr. Annamalai Subramanian (Japan) delivered an overview of POPs and metals in the Asia-Pacific region.  
The concentrations of different contaminants of concern have been quantified in some of the hundreds of 
invertebrate, fish, seabird and marine mammal species for which samples have been stored at the 
Environmental Specimen Bank for Global Monitoring at Ehime University, Japan.  Results reveal widespread 
environmental responses to the use, disposal and regulation of many of the POPs.  Of note was the influence of 
the biology of the species selected on the contaminant message: sessile mussels provided evidence of ‘local’ 
contamination, while migratory albatross and northern fur seals provided a more regional or ‘global’ 
contaminant signal. 
 
Local participants, including Olga Lukyanova, Mikhail Simokon and Vasiliy Tsygankov, described some of 
the priority concerns along the coastline of the Russian Far East and adjacent waters.  While human population 
density is relatively low in this region, there exist concerns about offshore oil and gas exploration and 
development in the Sea of Okhotsk, metals related to local industrial activity, radioactive releases, and POPs 
and biological pollutants from global sources. 
 
Workshop Recommendations 
 
To recommend establishing a one-year Study Group on Marine Pollutants to: 
 Identify novel approaches to operational marine pollution assessment by developing a list of priority 
pollutant concerns in each PICES nation; identifying indicators of status, trends and effects; harmonizing 
Appendices  Section 8 
30  PICES Scientific Report No. 46 
methods to evaluate their effects on biota; and describing case studies which illustrate the effectiveness of 
indicators in informing the success of remedial actions. 
 Identify interactions within PICES scientific committees and expert groups that will complement the SG-
MP, and be consistent with FUTURE. 
 Explore potential partnerships with other organizations which could lead to joint activities, improve 
efficiencies and strengthen scientific outcomes. 
 Develop recommendations for a PICES expert group on marine pollutants.

AGENDA ITEM 6  
Proposed Study Group on Marine Pollutants (SG-MP)  
Drs. Olga Lukyanova and Peter Ross convened workshop (W3) on “Pollutants in a changing ocean: Refining 
indicator approaches in support of coastal management” at PICES-2011) with contributed support from 
GESAMP, ICES, and IOC.  The workshop included presentations by 4 invited speakers, a series of brief 
“power-talks”, discussions sessions, and presentation of 6 posters. During the workshop, participants discussed 
the role and scope of international collaborative work on the issue of marine pollutants and contaminants, and 
developed a proposal for a Study Group to report through the MEQ Committee.  It is widely recognized that 
pollution of the North Pacific marine environment has affected fish and wildlife in some regions at the 
population level, and has led to socio-economic impacts such as commercial fishing closures, barriers to 
commercial trade, and restrictions on seafood consumption.  Improving approaches to pollution assessments 
among PICES member countries may help to alleviate many of these problems, and could better inform 
Section 8  Appendices 
PICES Scientific Report No. 46  31 
managers and stakeholders in addressing emerging pollution issues.  The purpose of the proposed Study Group 
is to identify novel or promising approaches to monitoring pollutant trends over space and time, and to 
evaluate impacts on biota at the population level.  The Study Group will establish a list of priority substances 
and pollutant indicators in PICES member countries using a series of case studies (e.g., microplastics in 
seawater, seabird egg monitoring for POPs over time; risk-based ranking of complex pollutant mixtures in 
sediments).  This will help identify those methods or approaches that would benefit from harmonization (e.g., 
characterization of heterogeneous microplastic content in seawater or biota), and improve data delivery and 
scientific advice to managers and stakeholders.

Environmental contaminants in marine ecosystems: Seabirds and marine mammals as sentinels of 
ecosystem health  
 
October 17, 2012 
 
Co-sponsored by: JSPS 
 
Co-convenors: Peter Ross (Canada), Hideshige Takada (Japan) and Yutaka Watanuki (Japan) 
 
Background 
 
Urban and industrial developments in the world’s coastal regions have led to the release of a large number of 
pollutants (heavy metals, POPs, plastics, oils, radioactive substances) into the marine environment.  In some 
cases, these have detrimental effects on variety of marine resources in coastal and offshore areas. It is 
increasingly important to identify sources, subsequent transport through marine physical systems and resulting 
spatial patterns of these anthropogenic stressors.  Compared to river-lake systems, knowledge of anthropogenic 
stressors in marine systems is less understood due to difficulties with detection over wide areas and in offshore 
regions.  As top predators, such as many marine mammals and seabirds, bio-magnify some of these pollutants, 
these organisms can be used as bio-indicators of coastal, marine and/or food web contamination.  The utility of 
these ‘sentinels’ was discussed at the PICES-2011 MEQ Workshop. This session:  1) identified spatial patterns 
and geographic areas of concern (high concentrations) of pollutants or other stressors in the PICES region 
using bio-indicator species, 2) examined mechanisms of transport, and ultimate disposition, of contaminants in 
marine ecosystems, and 3) discussed health risks for certain predators and human consumers.  Review papers, 
case studies, and innovative methods papers on anthropogenic stressors in marine predators were invited, as 
well as papers that distinguished between the effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors.  In particular, 
studies linking predator habitat use with spatial aspects of stressors in the environment and in predators were 
encouraged.  
 
Summary of presentations 
 
Ten talks (5 from Japan, 2 from Canada, 1 from Korea, 1 from Russia, and 1 from UK,) and 4 posters (all from 
Russia) were given.  Spatial patterns and interannual changes in POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants), 
including PCBs, DDTs, HCHs, and PBDs in marine birds and some terrestrial birds were presented, and their 
usefulness as bio-indicators were discussed.  A common theme among many of the presentations was the need 
to consider age and the trophic level as important factors when evaluating and comparing contaminants levels 
among species or populations.  Case studies of monitoring marine debris ashore and POPs in plastic pellets 
were also presented.  Forty to 50 people, including bird and mammal researchers, geochemists, and 
biochemists attended the session and gave useful discussion.  The co-convenors discussed the potential for a 
review paper on the usefulness and limitation of marine birds and mammals as indicators of marine pollutants, 
and the spatial patterns of POPs shown by them in the PICES region.

Report of the Study Group on Marine Pollutants 
 
 
The Study Group on Marine Pollutants (SG-MP Endnote 1) met at PICES-2012 on October 12, 2012, in 
Hiroshima, Japan, to finalize its report to the MEQ Committee and to formulate recommendations for future 
PICES activities.  A draft of the Study Group report comprised input on research needs and priorities for the 
North Pacific Ocean, and identified opportunities for future collaboration.  The SG-MP brought together 
participation and feedback from all six PICES member countries, and built on the successful workshop held at 
PICES-2011 in Khabarovsk, Russia. 
 
The SG-MP: 
i) identified pollution priorities for the North Pacific Ocean,  
ii) proposed a selection of indicator (sentinel) approaches to pollution research and monitoring,  
iii) recommended efforts to carry out inter-laboratory calibration and method sharing, and 
iv) identified several existing or proposed multi-lateral or professional partnerships.  
 
While the SG-MP noted variation in the responses (priorities) of PICES member countries, there was broad 
agreement on a common working list of important marine pollution topics for the North Pacific Ocean.  These 
included: 
i) identification of priority pollutants (persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic pollutants; hydrocarbons; 
metals, elements and radionuclides; microplastics; biological pollutants);  
ii) evaluation of useful and relevant indicator approaches to assessing ocean pollution (water/air/sediments; 
marine mammals and seabirds; fish; benthos; seaweeds; plastics);  
iii) identification of inter-laboratory method calibration opportunities and study design sharing; and  
iv) multilateral collaboration opportunities (ICES, GESAMP, NOWPAP, SETAC).  
 
Indicators of pollution can provide an effective integrated message to managers (e.g., response to regulations, 
source control, remediation, risk-based evaluation of seafood safety, general ecosystem indicators).  
 
Based on input of the six PICES member countries during the 2011–2012 year, and deliberations during the 
2012 meeting at Hiroshima, the SG-MP proposed three activities to PICES (MEQ Committee):  
i) establish a new Section on Emerging Topics in Marine Pollution (S-ETMP) (SG-MP Endnote 2);  
ii) convene a ½-day Topic Session at PICES-2013 (Nanaimo, Canada) on “Status, trends and effects of 
pollutants in coastal ecosystems: Implications for wildlife and humans” (SG-MP Endnote 3);   
iii) organize a workshop/field trip on “Traditional seafoods of the Snuneymux’w First Nation: Insight into 
food, social and ceremonial uses” (SG-MP Endnote 4) to be hosted at the local aboriginal community 
during PICES-2013.

Proposal to establish a new Section on Emerging Topics in Marine Pollution 
 
The Study Group on Marine Pollutants proposes a new PICES Section on Emerging Topics in Marine 
Pollution that will provide an expert platform for the timely discussion of new pollution issues and priorities in 
the North Pacific Ocean.  Marine pollution priorities vary over space and time, and as a function of human and 
industrial activities.  In some cases, marine pollution can affect the socio-economic well-being of coastal 
communities by reducing the availability of safe and abundant seafoods, affecting the health of endangered 
species, and/or negatively impacting the value of the ecotourism sector.  The protection of ecosystem health 
and services requires rapid and sensitive means to detect emerging pollutant issues before serious adverse 
impacts arise.  Regulations and/or other management actions resulting from marine pollution research in the 
past has led to dramatic declines in environmental concentrations of a number of harmful pollutants, 
subsequently improving the health of marine biota.  This Section will work with the MEQ and FIS committees 
and provide a leadership role in the provision of advice, and the planning of special sessions and workshops.  
The Section will identify new contaminants of concern, clarify priority pollutant concerns, and assess the 
relative importance of pollutants among other natural and anthropogenic stressors. 
 
The establishment of this Section will ensure the continued availability of expertise on marine pollutants 
within PICES, and deliver guidance to the FUTURE Advisory Panels (AICE, COVE and SOFE). Since 
climate change is affecting the transport, fate and effects of marine pollutants, this Section will also be of value 
to other committees, working groups and sections.  Importantly, the proposed Section will address the question 
identified in the FUTURE Science Plan “How do human activities affect coastal ecosystems and how are 
societies affected by changes in these ecosystems?” 
 
Terms of Reference 
 
1. Identify emerging marine pollutants in the North Pacific Ocean by: 
a. convening timely Topic Sessions and workshops on new and emerging pollutants and pollution issues; 
b. identifying useful indicators of status, trends and effects; and 
c. providing ecosystem-based advice to PICES Sections, Working Groups and Advisory Panels, 
especially those identified in the FUTURE Science Plan (AICE, COVE and SOFE). 
2. Establish partnerships with other professional or multilateral organizations (e.g., ICES, GESAMP, 
NOWPAP and SETAC). 
3. Conduct joint activities (working group, sessions, publications) with other parties. 
4. Design and/or conduct special projects on emerging marine pollutants.

Proposal for a ½-day Topic Session on “Status, trends and effects of pollutants in coastal ecosystems: 
Implications for wildlife and humans” at PICES-2013 
 
Marine pollutants can impact the quality and/or abundance of invertebrates, fish, and wildlife. In addition, the 
contamination of seafood can diminish the viability of commercial species and/or deliver potentially harmful 
contaminants to human consumers.  While pollutant topics vary geographically, a number of priority pollutants 
are common throughout the northern hemisphere.  This session will highlight a number of practical approaches 
to assessing the status, trends and effects of emerging and/or priority pollutants in the PICES region, as well as 
examples from other parts of the world.  Some of these approaches are presently being used as indicators of 
marine environmental quality in some jurisdictions.  Examples include the ‘Mussel Watch’ program for 
monitoring metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), spatial and temporal trends in POPs in seabird 
eggs, and effects of POPs and hydrocarbons on the health of marine biota.  Some of these efforts have proven 
very useful in revealing improvements to marine ecosystem health subsequent to the implementation of 
regulations, including the dramatic declines in PCB, DDT, dioxin and organotin levels and associated effects. 
Nevertheless, a number of pollutant concerns are emerging, such as replacement flame retardants, 
pharmaceuticals, and current use pesticides.  Characterizing the status, trends and effects of marine pollutants 
in coastal ecosystem components can provide cost-effective means to guide regulations, source control and/or 
remediation strategies that will ultimately protect ecosystem health and services.

Proposal for a 1-day Workshop and field trip on “Traditional seafoods of coastal aboriginal communities 
in the North Pacific: Insight into food, social and ceremonial uses at  
Snuneymux’w First Nation in Nanaimo, British Columbia” at PICES-2013 
Seafoods are integral part of the nutritional, social and cultural fabric of many aboriginal communities 
inhabiting coastal regions of the North Pacific Ocean. The Snuneymux’w First Nation in Nanaimo, British 
Columbia, is home to 1,200 residents who have relied heavily on seafoods for thousands of years.  Despite 
now living in an urban environment with ready access to supermarket foods, it has been recently estimated that 
the average individual from this aboriginal community consumes 12 to 15 times as much seafood as the 
average Canadian.  Much of this is harvested locally by native fishers.  Community members routinely express 
concerns about the quality and quantity of their local seafoods.  It is becoming increasingly evident that the 
availability of nutritious and uncontaminated seafoods is important for food, social and ceremonial purposes in 
this other coastal communities in BC.  This workshop will bring together local members of the Snuneymux’w 
First Nation and PICES participants, and provide an invaluable opportunity for sharing, learning and teaching 
about the importance of traditional seafoods to this aboriginal community.  The workshop will involve 
discussions on science and traditional ecological knowledge. 
This workshop is open to any participant attending the 2013 PICES Annual Meeting, but a maximum capacity 
is set at 45 persons.  The workshop will be of interest to persons working on issues of marine stewardship, 
marine resource management, seafoods, and local cultures.  Local practices, culture and traditions of First 
Nations will be showcased at this workshop, with additional input from resource persons from other 
communities.  The workshop will feature:  
 cultural welcome and prayer from representative of the Chief-in-Council, Snuneymux’w First Nation;  
 song and drum opening from local community members;  
 teachings from local community elders on marine resource management and sustainable harvesting;  
Section 8  Appendices 
PICES Scientific Report No. 46  37 
 discussions on the role of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) in a science-driven world (a panel of 
elders and scientists will be invited to prepare 4 × 15 minute talks, followed by discussions);  
 a tour of the local seashore south of Nanaimo where practical demonstrations will take place on techniques 
to harvest seaweeds, shellfish and other seafoods;  
 preparation of lunch foods using traditional aboriginal cooking techniques including a pit-cook and 
bentwood box; lunch and snacks comprising locally and seasonally-available foods as prawns, oysters, sea 
urchins, salmon, halibut, and a variety of crops and plants.

Co-Convenors: Peter Ross (Canada) and local community members 
 
 
Background 
 
A one-day PICES workshop (W7) on indigenous seafoods was held in the traditional territory of the 
Snuneymux’w First Nation near Nanaimo, British Columbia (BC), on Friday October 11, 2013.  The workshop 
touched on aspects of marine stewardship, marine resource management, seafoods, and local aboriginal 
culture.  Seafoods are an integral part of the nutritional, social and cultural fabric of aboriginal communities 
inhabiting coastal regions of the North Pacific Ocean.  The Snuneymux’w First Nation in Nanaimo is home to 
1,200 residents who have relied heavily on seafoods for thousands of years.  Despite now living in an urban 
environment with ready access to supermarket foods, it has been recently estimated that the average individual 
from this aboriginal community consumes 12 to 15 times as much seafood as the average Canadian.  Much of 
this is harvested locally by native fishers.  Community members routinely express concerns about the quality 
and quantity of their local seafoods.  It is becoming increasingly evident that the availability of nutritious and 
uncontaminated seafoods is important for food, social and ceremonial purposes in this other coastal 
communities in BC. 
 
Summary of Workshop 
 
The morning session took place at the Vancouver Island University First Nations Shq’aqpthut (‘Gathering 
Place’; http://www.viu.ca/gatheringplace/gallery.aspx).  This session featured an opening prayer and song by 
Geraldine Manson, the Vancouver Island University elder-in-residence from Snuneymux’w.  Geraldine 
described the importance of seafoods to her community, and recounted stories told by her parents and 
grandparents on topics of harvesting, cooking and stewardship.  Geraldine then introduced Gary Manson, also 
an elder from Snuneymux’w.  Gary described the historical importance of the Nanaimo River estuary for 
shellfish, crab and chum salmon harvesting.  He also talked about the annual journey by canoe over the Strait 
of Georgia to the Fraser River for sockeye salmon harvesting.  The importance of Gary’s role as elder 
‘knowledge keeper’ for the Snumeymux’w was evident in the afternoon when he led workshop participants on 
a tribal canoe journey over to salmon petroglyphs at Jack Point across the estuary. 
 
John Rampanen, “naas-a-thluk”, then narrated his family history in the Nuu-chah-nulth Nation – Ahousaht and 
Tla-o-qui-aht territories.  John is an advocate for traditional foods and medicine. He combines traditional 
ecological knowledge with contemporary approaches and is dedicated to providing a strong sense of 
traditionally-oriented understanding and knowledge amongst First Nations youth and non-Native community 
partners.  With a background in traditional medicinal practices, healthcare, counseling and indigenous foods, 
John has redeveloped a presence on his traditional territory (located on the western coast of Vancouver Island) 
where he now lives with his growing family.

After the tribal canoe journey, some workshop members feasted on tasty smoked and barbequed chum salmon 
at Snuneymux’w beach hosted by Paul Wyse-Seward and Chris Good.  The success of the workshop was due 
to the kind assistance of Vancouver Island University (Geraldine Manson, Michele Patterson, Grant Murray, 
Cathy Fee and students), Snuneymux’w First Nation (Gary Manson, Chris Good, Paul Wyse-Seward and 
Theodore Barker), and the entire staff of the PICES Secretariat.

Summary of presentations 
 
Session S3 was held on Wednesday, October 16, 2013 (half day).  It was launched with two invited speakers, 
Sandra O’Neill (Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, USA) and Lorrie Rea (University of Alaska 
Fairbanks, USA) and included other 6 oral presentations, 14 posters, and time for discussion. Approximately 
30 to 40 people, including marine and geochemists, marine biologists, and bird and mammal researchers 
attended the session and provided useful comments. 
 
The session covered a wide spectrum of pollutants (persistent organic pollutants, polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons, tributyltin, mercury, arsenic, microplastics and infective human enteric virus) in the Pacific 
region from all six PICES member countries.  There are on-going marine chemical pollution issues which 
affect salmon and stellar sea lion populations. O’Neill et al. found that the tissue residue levels and 
composition of persistent organic pollutants were distinctly different among five Pacific salmon species, 
depending their dwelling region, migratory route and diet.  Rea et al. showed that Steller sea lions in the 
western Aleutian Islands had an apparent elevation in mercury and discussed its possible relationship with 
population decline in specific region.  Simokon et al. reported on arsenic pollution originating from land-based 
activity in the coastal ecosystems of Far Eastern Seas. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contamination and 
their possible source and input pathways after the great tsunami in Japan were presented by Maki et al. 
Effective reduction of tributyltin levels in water and biota as well as its effects on marine organism was 
evaluated by Shim et al. after the implementation of total ban on tributyltin based antifouling paints in Korea. 
It could be a good example of proper management of marine chemical pollutants.  A new emerging pollutant, 
microplastics in the marine environment in coastal British Columbia, was revealed by Desforges et al.  An 
abundance of floating microplastics showed an obvious gradient from the coast to the open ocean.  Watanuki 
et al. presented on a monitoring technique using feathers of tracked seabirds for investigating the spatial pattern 
of marine pollution was presented. Fan (Fan and Ming) discussed infective human enteric virus contamination 
Section 8  Appendices 
PICES Scientific Report No. 46  41 
and its risk assessment in surface seawater of Bohai Bay, China, and demonstrated that it is required to manage 
pathogen pollution.  Poster presentations included microplastic pollution and its biological effects, 
spatiotemporal distribution of persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals. Through this session, presenters 
and audience agreed that there is still a variety of marine pollution issues to be dealt with in the Pacific region. 
Legacy and emerging persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals and marine debris including microplastics 
are high priority issues and topics in the Pacific.  There is a growing need to address these pollution issues in 
the North Pacific region through an expert group.  Based on the proposal of the Study Group of Marine 
Pollutants (SG-MP), a new Working Group on Emerging Topics in Marine Pollution (WG-ETMP/WG 31) 
was established under the direction of the Marine Environmental Quality Committee during the Annual Meeting.

Report of the Study Group on Marine Pollutants 
 
 
The Study Group on Marine Pollutants (SG-MP; 2011–2013) met for its final business meeting under the 
chairmanship of Dr. Peter Ross in Nanaimo, Canada, on Saturday, October 12, 2013 (see SG-MP Endnote 1 
for list of participants).  This ½-day meeting followed the workshop (W7) on “Traditional seafoods of the 
Snuneymux’w First Nation in Nanaimo, BC: Insight into food, social and ceremonial uses”.  
 
At the meeting participants reviewed past activities of the SG-MP and  
i)  made changes to complete the SG-MP final report for submission to MEQ for approval;  
ii)  made changes to the proposal for a new Section on Emerging Topics in Marine Pollution (later 
recommended as a Working Group by Science Board; SG-MP Endnote 2).  Included in the list of plans for 
the proposed Section were Topic Sessions and workshops, which will lead to special journal issues and a 
contribution to the 3
rd
 PICES North Pacific Status Report during the period 2014–2016;  
iii)  finalized a proposal for a Topic Session on “Marine debris in the ocean: Sources, transport, fate and 
effects of macro- and micro-plastics” (SG-MP Endnote 3) for PICES-2014 in Yeosu, Korea (to be co-
sponsored by NOWPAP, GESAMP and ICES).

Proposal for a Section on Emerging Topics in Marine Pollution (S-ETMP) 
 
General objectives 
 
Pollution can adversely affect the health and abundance of marine biota, especially in densely-populated 
coastal areas.  The downstream socio-economic consequences can be significant, with numerous examples of 
consumption advisories, commercial fishery closures, commercial trade interdictions and diminished 
aboriginal access to food resources around the North Pacific Ocean.  The protection of ecosystem health and 
services requires an ability to detect emerging pollutant issues before serious adverse impacts arise. 
Regulations, policies and other management actions resulting from marine pollution research in the past have 
led to dramatic declines in environmental concentrations of a number of harmful pollutants, subsequently 
improving the health of marine biota.  
 
This proposed Section will provide leadership on emerging pollution issues to the PICES community, 
reporting through the MEQ Committee.  The S-ETMP will convene a series of timely Topics Sessions and 
workshops, and coordinate special issues in international peer-reviewed journals.  The Section will ensure the 
continued availability of expertise on marine pollutants within PICES, and deliver guidance to the FUTURE 
Advisory Panels (notably AICE and SOFE).  The Section will collaborate with other PICES expert groups in 
co-convening activities or compiling data.  Importantly, the Section will address the question identified in the 
Section 8  Appendices 
PICES Scientific Report No. 46   43 
FUTURE Science Plan “How do human activities affect coastal ecosystems and how are societies affected by 
changes in these ecosystems?”  
 
Terms of Reference 
 
1. Document and profile emerging marine pollution issues in the North Pacific Ocean within the PICES 
community by:  
a. Convening Topic Sessions and workshops on new and emerging pollutants and pollution issues; 
b. Coordinating a series of special issues in international peer-reviewed journals based on topic sessions; 
and  
c. Contributing to the next edition of the PICES North Pacific Ecosystem Status Report by compiling 
data describing spatial and temporal trends for pollution indicators in the North Pacific Ocean.  
2. Strengthen partnerships to deliver Topic Sessions/workshops and to publish special issues with: 
a. Other PICES expert groups, especially those identified in the FUTURE Science Plan. 
b. Other multilateral organizations, including the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 
(ICES), the Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection 
(GESAMP), and the Northwest Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP). 
 
Proposed activities 2014–2019 (3 yr + 3 yr) 
 
The Section on Emerging Topics in Marine Pollution will engage in specific activities that will identify 
contaminants of emerging concern, prioritize pollutants from the many sources, and assess the relative 
importance of pollutants among other natural and anthropogenic stressors.  Members will contribute to 
discussions and strategic planning with the MEQ Committee as well as through other PICES expert groups.  
The S-ETMP will build on the success of a number of activities carried out by the SG-MP, including two 
workshops (2011, Khabarovsk: Pollutants in a changing ocean: Refining indicator approaches in support of 
coastal management and 2013, Nanaimo: Traditional seafoods of coastal aboriginal communities in the North 
Pacific: Insight into food, social and ceremonial uses at Snuneymux’w First Nation in Nanaimo, British 
Columbia) and two Topic Sessions (2012, Hiroshima: Environmental contaminants in marine ecosystems: 
Seabirds and marine mammals as sentinels of ecosystem health; 2013, Nanaimo: Status, trends and effects of 
pollutants in coastal ecosystems: Implications for wildlife and humans).  The proposal for establishing a S-
ETMP will benefit from the current support of ICES and GESAMP.

Compilation of data for marine pollution 
Compiled data for marine pollution indicators and findings will be delivered to multiple PICES expert groups, 
in particular to AP-SOFE, in support of the North Pacific Ecosystem Status Report ~2016/17. 
 
The S-ETMP will directly address the following questions of the FUTURE program: 
3. How do human activities affect coastal ecosystems and how are societies affected by changes in these 
ecosystems? 
3.1  What are the dominant anthropogenic pressures in coastal marine ecosystems and how are they changing?  
• By characterizing emerging pollution priorities in the North Pacific Ocean. 
 
3.2  How are these anthropogenic pressures and climate forcings, including sea level rise, affecting nearshore 
and coastal ecosystems and their interactions with offshore and terrestrial systems? 
• By documenting the impacts of emerging pollutants in the North Pacific Ocean, especially in coastal 
environments, and in a changing ocean environment. 
 
3.3  How do multiple anthropogenic stressors interact to alter the structure and function of the systems, and 
what are the cumulative effects? 
• By collaborating with other expert groups to document importance of marine pollution relative to 
multiple stressors.  
 
3.4  What will be the consequences of projected coastal ecosystem changes and what is the predictability and 
uncertainty of forecasted changes? 
• By developing approaches to pollutant indicators that account for climate variability and change. 
• By characterizing changing pollution risks as climate changes. 
 
3.5  How can we effectively use our understanding of coastal ecosystem processes and mechanisms to 
identify the nature and causes of ecosystem changes and to develop strategies for sustainable use? 
• By prioritizing pollutant sources and types in support of source control, regulations and best practices. 
• By translating compiled data and findings through the PICES North Pacific Status Report to formats 
that are understandable to the general public and a wider audience.

“Marine debris in the Ocean: Sources, transport, fate and effects of macro- and micro-plastics”  
at PICES-2014

Marine debris is increasingly recognized as a threat to biota in the ocean, which can have a range of socio-
economic impacts from coastal areas to the open ocean.  The majority of marine debris consists of synthetic 
polymers, or ‘plastics’, which readily float on the ocean surface or are suspended in the water column.  
Microplastics may be attributed to the intentional manufacture of commercial products or the fragmentation of 
plastic products.  They can increase the bioavailable fraction of marine litter and act as a vector for the delivery 
of intrinsic or adsorbed toxic chemicals to exposed biota.  Floating, submerged and beached debris have been 
documented in marginal seas and the adjacent coastal zone of the North Pacific Ocean.  In addition, the North 
Pacific Ocean Gyre is known to accumulate floating debris in what has become known as the “Great Pacific 
Garbage Patch”.  Marine debris represents trans-boundary pollution which can also deliver associated 
chemicals and invasive organisms to regions far removed from source.  The objective of this session is to 
present status and trend information for marine plastic debris pollution and its environmental consequences in 
the PICES region.  Papers are invited that assess macro- or micro-plastic debris 1) hotspots in the PICES 
region, 2) source and input pathways, 3) long-range transport, 4) role as sink or source of associated toxic 
chemicals, and 5) biological and ecological effects.  Recommendations on how to address growing problems 
associated with marine debris will be also considered.

PICES-2011 Workshop on “Trends in Marine Contaminants  
and their Effects in a Changing Ocean” 
 
by Peter S. Ross and Olga Lukyanova 
 
The sheer number of contaminants entering the North 
Pacific Ocean from a combination of point and non-point 
sources provides a daunting backdrop to those concerned 
with the protection of aquatic biota.  However, this did not 
deter the 16 participants at the workshop on “Trends in 
marine contaminants and their effects in a changing ocean: 
Refining indicator approaches in support of coastal 
management”, who spent a productive day discussing 
topics related to the workshop theme, and a day sampling 
for microplastics on the Amur River.  This workshop, co-
sponsored by GESAMP (Joint Group of Experts on the 
Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection) 
and ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the 
Sea), was held on October 14, 2011, in conjunction with 
the 2011 PICES Annual Meeting in Khabarovsk, Russia. 
 
The workshop agenda included four invited presentations.  
Representatives from GESAMP and ICES delivered 
concise insight into their concerns, priorities, and activities.  
Dr. Peter Kershaw (Centre for Environment, Fisheries and 
Aquaculture Science, UK) described the mandate and 
activities of the UN-sponsored GESAMP, which is also 
supported by IMO, FAO, IOC-UNESCO, WMO, IAEA, 
UNEP and UNIDO.  GESAMP provides expert advice on 
priority topics, as well as assessments of regional and 
global environmental concerns.  One major activity of 
relevance to PICES is reflected in GESAMP efforts to 
identify and apply pollution indicators for the UN 
Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme (TWAP) in 
five categories: groundwater, rivers, lakes, Large Marine 
Ecosystems (LMEs) and open oceans.  GESAMP currently 
has a number of Working Groups that are active in such 
areas as “mercury, cadmium and lead” (WG 37), “the 
historical inputs of contaminants into coastal ecosystems” 
(WG 39), and “source, fate and effects of microplastics in 
the marine environment” (WG 40).  In addition, a new 
Correspondence Group is being established to evaluate the 
“biomagnification of pollutants in top predators”.  This 
concern for the scale of pollution impacts on the marine 
environment is shared by the general public (Fig. 1). 
 
Dr. Kris Cooreman (Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries 
Research, Belgium) described the aim within the ICES 
realm for integrated science in support of management.  He 
stressed that fisheries regulations were ineffectual when the 
root causes of reduced fish stocks are unrelated to fishing, 
and presented one case study on the decades-long decline 
in the abundance of shrimp (Crangon crangon) which had 
been attributed to overfishing.  However, recent research 
suggests that the extensive contamination of coastal 
sediments in Europe by the antifoulant chemical tributyltin  
 
Fig. 1 Over 10,000 people respond: “When you are thinking about the 
coastline or the sea, what are the three most important matters 
that come to mind?” (http://www.CLAMER.eu). 
 
(TBT) historically used on vessel hulls caused reduced 
growth and survival of shrimp.  In addition to this example 
of a population-level impact related to a single chemical, 
other European examples include the effects of PCBs (poly-
chlorinated biphenyls) and DDT (dichlorodiphenyl-
trichloroethane) on reproduction and health of seabirds and 
marine mammals.  A long history of interest in the area of 
marine pollution positions ICES extremely well to partner 
with PICES on subjects of mutual interest into the future. 
 
Dr. Joel Baker (Center for Urban Waters, University of 
Washington, U.S.A.) presented an overview on the emerging 
microplastics concern, which provided a basis for the field 
trip on the Amur River the next day (see photos).  This one 
pollutant category encompasses a very wide variety of 
types, sizes, shapes, colours and origins for this “structural 
pollutant”, highlighting the need for standardized 
assessment methods.  “Microplastics” may be defined as 
any solid material < 5 mm that is primarily composed of 
synthetic polymers, but may also be considered from a 
practical perspective to be larger than 330 µm so as to be 
compatible with ichthyoplanktonic surveys.  Microplastics 
include both primary (produced intentionally for consumer 
products) and secondary (generated by disintegration of 
larger materials) materials.  Major challenges, and hence 
opportunities for collaboration in the North Pacific, are: 
methods to detect and quantify, distribution over space, and 
effects on biota (including invertebrates, fish, turtles, 
seabirds and marine mammals).  Evidence of impact today 
is largely limited to the visually obvious macroplastics 
which have caused mortality in some stranded turtles, 
seabirds, and marine mammals. 
 
Dr. Annamalai Subramanian (Ehime University, Japan) 
delivered an overview of persistent organic pollutants 
(POPs) and metals in the Asia-Pacific region.  Dedicated 
sampling from multiple species over the past three decades 
has been carried out through the Environmental Specimen 
Bank for Global Monitoring at his university.  Contaminants

A field trip to the Amur River near Khabarovsk on October 15, 2011, provided an opportunity for some of the workshop participants to conduct surface 
tows for microplastics from a small craft.  Shown here clockwise, starting at top is the sampling platform, participants decanting microplastic samples

have been determined for some of the many hundreds of 
invertebrate, fish, seabird and marine mammal species for 
which samples have been collected and preserved over time 
and space.  Results reveal widespread environmental 
responses to the use, disposal and subsequent regulation of 
many of the POPs.  Mussels have been utilized as sessile 
indicators of coastal pollution by POPs and metals 
throughout Asia.  Albatross have been used to provide an 
integrated measure of POPs along their migratory corridor.  
Northern fur seals reveal improvements in the way of 
reductions in the concentrations of some POPs over time. 
 
Russian scientists, including Olga Lukyanova, Mikhail 
Simokon and Vasiliy Tsygankov, provided insight into some 
of the priority concerns along the coastline of the Russian 
Far East and adjacent waters.  While human population 
density is relatively low in this region, there exist concerns 
about offshore oil and gas exploration and development in 
the Sea of Okhotsk, metals related to local industrial activity, 
radioactive releases, and POPs and biological pollutants 
from global sources. 
 
Because of the complexity of marine pollution issues in the 
North Pacific Ocean, workshop participants were focussed 
on defining concepts and strategies that would lead to 
pragmatic indicators.  It was agreed that a series of basic 
concepts should be used to identify contaminant indicators 
that could be shared among PICES member countries.  In 
Section 8  Appendices 
PICES Scientific Report No. 46   49 
this way, the indicator must: 
 involve a species (e.g., mussels) or matrix (e.g., 
sediment) which is well understood; 
 involve a pollutant or class of pollutants for 
which analytical methods are available; 
 provide the best available science to 
management; 
 provide insight into spatial and temporal 
changes; 
 have linkages to a risk of adverse effects; 
 be responsive to regulations; 
 be able to identify emerging contaminant 
concerns; 
 be cost-effective. 
 
Since there exists no single indicator which can 
adequately capture all contaminant concerns, 
workshop participants acknowledged the need for a 
suite of indicators which could capture different 
contaminant types including, for example, persistent, 
bioaccumulative contaminants (e.g., POPs) in seabird 
eggs or marine mammals, metals and radionuclides 
in mussels, hydrocarbons in flatfish, and plastics in 
seawater.  Several regional examples from researchers 
in different PICES member countries were cited as 
examples to build on, where opportunities to improve 
analytical techniques, exchange samples, collect new 
samples, and/or exchange expertise were considered. 
 
During the next year, a new PICES Study Group on 
Marine Pollutants (SG-MP) will operate under the 
aegis of the Marine Environmental Quality (MEQ) Committee to 
identify novel approaches to operational marine pollution 
assessment with the aim of: establishing a list of priority 
pollutants; identifying indicators of status, trends and effects; 
harmonizing methods to evaluate impacts on biota; and describing 
case studies which demonstrate the effectiveness of indicators to 
inform the success of remedial actions.  This effort will create 
opportunities for PICES scientists to participate in a renewal of 
the pollution topic and to identify emerging concerns, technologies 
and concepts into the FUTURE.

participants went on an excursion on the Amur River to collect microplastics under
