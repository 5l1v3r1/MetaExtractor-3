This publication includes reports given at a workshop on “Conditions promoting Pseudo-nitzschia events 
in the eastern Pacific but not the western Pacific” co-convened by Drs. Vera L. Trainer (USA) and Polina 
Kameneva (Russia) on November 3, 2016 at the PICES 2016 Annual Meeting in San Diego, USA (see 
Appendix 2). The workshop was focused on the diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia, historically associated with 
dramatic negative impacts on the economy of shellfish harvests, the well-being of  marine life and human 
health in the northeastern Pacific PICES member countries (Canada, USA), with little or no impact in the 
northwestern Pacific (China, Japan, Korea and Russia).  
Diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia (H. Peragallo, 1900) are widely distributed in the plankton 
assemblages of both coastal and open ocean waters (Hasle et al., 1996; reviewed in Lelong et al., 2012 
and Trainer et al., 2012). Nineteen of the 46 currently recognized Pseudo-nitzschia species are known to 
produce the potent marine neurotoxin, domoic acid (DA; Teng et al., 2016), which can accumulate in fish 
and shellfish and leads to Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP) in humans, seabirds and marine mammals 
when they consume contaminated fish and shellfish (e.g., Lefebvre et al., 2002). It has been suggested 
that repeated exposure to low levels of DA may cause neuropathic injury to vertebrates, including people 
(Grattan et al., 2007).  
There is clear evidence of contrasting occurrence and impact of the toxin-producing diatom, Pseudo-
nitzschia, between the northwestern and northeastern Pacific. In Canadian and American Pacific waters, 
numerous cases of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia bloom events and mortalities of sea birds, sea lions, whales, 
and other marine mammals have been registered from the time of the discovery of DA in 1987 (Bates et 
al., 1989) up to the present day. In 2015, a massive bloom spanning from California to Alaska, linked to 
anomalously warm ocean conditions associated with both El Niño and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
(PDO cycles), had major impacts on the economic viability of the shellfish industry and on marine life 
health (McCabe et al., 2016). In contrast, Pseudo-nitzschia did not cause significant economic losses in 
the northwestern Pacific in 2015. Gathered data provide a unique opportunity to make East–West Pacific 
comparisons, and to identify and rank those environmental factors which promote Pseudo-nitzschia 
success as a harmful algae species. Special attention should be paid to the climate-driven environmental 
changes such as ocean acidification, warming of the sea surface, stratification pattern changes, and the 
availability of nutrients to definitively characterize those factors promoting toxic blooms. The recent 
PICES-supported symposium on HABs and Climate Change (May 19–22, 2015 Göteburg, Sweden) and 
the related synthesis paper (Wells et al., 2015) emphasize the importance of studying such extreme events 
to further our understanding of climate impacts on toxic blooms.

In the American and Canadian Pacific, long-lasting and intensive toxigenic blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia 
occur most often in spring and fall within extensive strong upwelling zones near retentive sites. Recent 
U.S. coastwide toxic bloom events are directly related to warm sea surface temperature anomalies 
associated with the El Niño and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) cycles, leading to faster growth (and 
northward expansion of P. australis habitat as seen in 2015), followed by increased toxin accumulation in 
razor clams (McCabe et al., 2016). Although many (and likely all) Pseudo-nitzschia species have the 
capacity to produce the neurotoxin domoic acid (DA), the most toxic Pseudo-nitzschia species within the 
California Current system are P. australis, P. multiseries and P. cf. pseudodelicatissima (also specified as 
P. cuspidata; reviewed in Trainer et al., 2012), whereas the most problematic highly toxic species off 
California appears to be P. australis (Table 1). 
Smaller, more localized blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia species occur within extensive coastal areas of the 
northwestern Pacific. These events typically occur during fall, winter, and summer in enclosed and semi-
enclosed areas influenced by intensive riverine discharge and in outer coastal areas near localized 
upwelling. Although no serious cases of amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) have been recorded in the 
northwestern Pacific region, DA-producing plankton have been  found repeatedly in Russia, Japan, and 
Korea, with traces of DA (up to 3 mg kg
–1
) recorded in mussels, scallops and razor clams. Contrary to the 
northeastern Pacific, P. multiseries generally is the most common highly toxic Pseudo-nitzschia species 
in the northwestern Pacific region (Table 1).

The duration, toxin concentrations, abundance, area and timing of Pseudo-nitzschia blooms are 
drastically different between the eastern and western Pacific.  The contrasting cases of harmful algal 
blooms (HABs) in these two regions, examined during the PICES 2012 Annual Meeting in Hiroshima, 
Japan, highlighted these differences.  An example data set comparing the relative abundance of Pseudo-
nitzschia and relative concentrations and impacts of DA from inland and coastal waterways of the 
U.S./Canada and Japan is shown in Figure 1.  
Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries, isolated and cultured from Russian and Japanese waters, were found to 
contain a maximum of 5390 ng ml
–1
 and 317 ng ml
–1
 DA, respectively (Kotaki et al., 1999; Orlova et al., 
2008). In contrast, estimates of maximum particulate DA in cultured isolates of Pseudo-nitzschia from 
Washington State are: P. australis (1.0 ng ml
–1
), P. multiseries (24.0 ng ml
–1
), P. cf. pseudodelicatissima 
(0.1 ng ml
–1
; Baugh et al., 2006) and from California: P. australis (up to 90 ng ml
-1
; Wingert, 2017).  
However, natural monospecific blooms of P. australis have estimated maximum concentrations of ~20 
mg ml
–1
; McCabe et al., 2016) and of P. cuspidata (formerly identified as part of the P. cf. 
pseudodelicatissima complex) can reach concentrations of 13.3 ng ml
–1
; Trainer et al., 2009b, reported as 
43 nmole L
–1
 particulate DA). However, it is likely that DA content can be much higher; in laboratory 
experiments a high proportion of DA is released from the cell (Wells et al., 2005), and dissolved DA is 
measured within Pseudo-nitzschia blooms (e.g., Trainer et al., 2009a).  It should be noted that in Russian 
western Pacific waters, and perhaps elsewhere in the northwestern Pacific, P. multiseries abundance has 
decreased drastically since 2002 (I. Stonik, unpubl. data), which may be considered as one of the probable 
causes of the low impact of Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in the northwestern Pacific over the past 15 years.

and events of sea bird, sea lion, whale, and other marine mammal 
mortalities (reviewed in Lelong et al., 2012 and Trainer et al., 
2012). 
Coastal waters of the northwestern Pacific Cases of high DA content in mussels (up to 33 mg kg
-1
) related to 
P. multiseries blooms were documented in the 1990s in Korea 
(Lee and Baik, 1997). No cases of ASP (animal mortality) were 
found. Traces of DA (up to 3 mg kg
-1
) were found in shellfish 
from Japan and Russia.  
South Asian waters DA contamination in shellfish reported in the Philippines, 
Vietnam and some tropical Asian countries, with no records of 
human poisoning (reviewed in Fukuyo et al., 2011). 
DA = domoic acid, ASP = amnesic shellfish poisoning 
It is not surprising then, that the ecological and economic impacts of DA differ vastly between the 
northeastern and the northwestern Pacific Ocean (Table 2). There have been numerous highly toxic events 
along the U.S. and Canadian Pacific coasts over the past 15 years, in many cases leading to poisoning of 
marine mammals and birds, and high economic costs (Rowles et al., 2017).  The most recent of these 
blooms (in 2015) lasted many consecutive months and caused prolonged closures of shellfish and crab 
fisheries (McCabe et al., 2016). Even so, blooms of toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. in northeastern 
Pacific coastal waters do not always generate toxic conditions.  In contrast, Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in 
the northwestern Pacific are rarely highly toxic, and economic losses are minor in comparison (Table 2).  
While there is no definitive understanding of the reasons for these stark differences, some of the likely 
environmental factors potentially may include the following:  
1)  Intensive, broad upwelling zones along the continental shelves off the eastern margins of the Pacific 
appear to promote the competitive success of Pseudo-nitzschia species, and once firmly established 
as a seed population, the increased nutrient flux into surface waters facilitates the generation of high 
Pseudo-nitzschia biomass. By contrast, intensive upwelling zones are far more restricted in scale in 
western Pacific nearshore waters, where the coastal oceanography is influenced more by enclosed 
and semi-enclosed seas and periodic intensive riverine discharge (Table 3).

 The interannual variation of upwelling in the Russian waters of Region 19 is determined mainly by 
the varying pressure of the Siberian High, which is a major center of action in the East Asian region 
(Zhabin et al., 2017). Upwelling intensity is also influenced by the magnitude of the atmospheric 
pressure gradient between the eastern part of the continent and the North Pacific Ocean. An increased 
upwelling intensity is observed in years with a developed Siberian High. Accordingly, during a weak 
Siberian High, the upwelling intensity in the northwestern portion of Region 19 declines. Intensive 
upwelling events appear to facilitate the competitive success of Pseudo-nitzschia species. For this 
reason, Zuenko and Rachkov (2015) hypothesize that the decrease in the abundance of P. multiseries 
in the 1990s in the northwestern portion of Region 19 can be related to the long-term tendency of the 
Siberian High and the summer monsoon to weaken during 1990–2015. 
2)  The supply of macronutrients (N, P, Si) often is cited as a contributing factor to increasing 
intracellular concentrations of DA in laboratory cultures (reviewed in Lelong et al., 2012), although 
there is no consistent pattern for this relationship in coastal waters (e.g., Trainer et al., 2009a). Sea 
surface concentrations of dissolved nutrients (N, P, Si) are higher in the northwestern Pacific Ocean 
than in the northeastern region during winter, but are similar by mid-summer, reflecting a greater 
nutrient drawdown (Fig. 2). In addition, given the importance of Si in building diatom cell walls, it 
may be no coincidence that the Si/N drawdown ratio is greater in the northwestern Pacific than the 
northeastern Pacific and that diatoms have a greater predominance along the Asian coast (Yasunaka 
et al., 2014).  The success of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia and accumulation of cellular DA under nutrient 
stress in the northeastern Pacific have been demonstrated in recent field studies (McCabe et al., 2016; 
McKibben et al., 2017). Pseudo-nitzschia can grow and produce DA using various nitrogen sources 
(nitrate, ammonium and urea; Armstrong et al., 2007).  Pseudo-nitzschia’s resilience is demonstrated 
also in its ability to occupy the same ecological niche as flagellates (e.g., the massive euglenoid 
bloom described in Trainer et al., 2009b).

3)  Coastal waters of the northwestern Pacific obtain more dissolved micronutrients from riverine 
discharge (Amur, Yangtze and others) than in the northeastern Pacific, and there is greater iron 
enrichment in the west as a consequence the southward flow of the Oyashio Current enriched with 
iron from the Sea of Okhotsk (Nishioka et al., 2011; Whitney, 2011). Areas with limiting iron 
concentrations in the northeastern Pacific have been proposed to be sites where Pseudo-nitzschia 
outcompete other phytoplankton and become highly toxic (Trainer et al., 2009b). There is evidence 
for a direct linkage between the rate of DA production and limitation of cell growth by the 
micronutrient Fe (Maldonado et al., 2002; Wells et al., 2005).  The more widely distributed riverine 
iron inputs, generally broader continental shelves (thus iron input from marginal shelf sediments), 
and higher rates of aerosol iron inputs (Fig. 3) in the northwestern Pacific region may all contribute to 
reducing the rates of DA production, and thus retained intracellular DA concentrations (i.e., reduced 
cell toxicity).

real-world observations (modified from https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/modis_fluorescence_briefing.html, 
Mike Behrenfeld, Oregon State University).  
It is clear that frequent and intense Pseudo-nitzschia blooms cause high DA toxicity in shellfish and the 
mortality of marine birds and mammals in the northeastern Pacific, and that despite the presence of 
Pseudo-nitzschia species capable of DA production in the northwestern Pacific, sometimes reaching 
bloom concentrations of >1 million cells L
–1
, no severe toxic episodes have been reported from the 
northwestern Pacific. Part of this disparity may be related to the apparent dominance of only one highly 
toxic species (P. multiseries) in the northwestern region vs. three primary species (P. multiseries, 
P. australis, and P. cuspidata) in the northeastern Pacific, but it is far more likely that differences in the 
frequencies and magnitude of these toxic bloom events are tied to underlying differences in 
oceanographic conditions in ways that are not yet understood. Two challenges guide the way forward. 
The first is to understand the fundamental limitations to the development of large blooms of toxigenic 
Pseudo-nitzschia spp., vs. other diatom species, and how these drivers differ between the northeastern and 
northwestern Pacific.  The second is to constrain the environmental circumstances that, once a Pseudo-
Stonik et al.  Overview

nitzschia bloom develops, leads to increased intracellular retention of DA.  The North Pacific provides a 
unique platform that, through collaboration among PICES member countries, can serve as a resource for 
investigating the root mechanistic causes for toxic diatom blooms.

Monitoring domoic acid contamination in shellfish 
Domoic acid (DA; Fig. 1) was first recognized as an amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) toxin in Canada 
(Wright et al., 1989) and the causative organism was identified as Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries (formerly 
Nitzschia pungens f. multiseries) (Bates et al., 1989). After this incident, monitoring systems were 
established in Canada, U.S., and in some European countries so as to prevent further ASP incidents. The 
Japanese government also took an interest in determining whether ASP occurs in Japan. The Fisheries 
Agency started to investigate the possibility of shellfish as a vector of ASP in Japan. This investigation 
was initiated by starting a series of projects coordinated through regional branches of the Fisheries 
Research Institute and a few university teams, including Kitasato University.  
 
Fig. 1 Structure of domoic acid (DA). 
In order to determine the possibility of ASP occurrences in eastern Japan, the monitoring of DA in 
shellfish began in Ofunato Bay in 1994. Five specimens of cultured scallops, Mizuhopecten yessoensis, 
and mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, were collected from the Shizu station (Ofunato Bay, station A, 
Fig. 2) monthly from April 1994 through February 1995. The digestive gland of scallops and edible part 
of mussels were extracted with 50% methanol, then analyzed by HPLC with UV detection (242 nm) after 
Kotaki et al.  Japan 
PICES Scientific Report No. 53  13 
purification through a Sep-Pack C18 cartridge (Quilliam et al., 1989). DA was detected from November 
1994 to February 1995 (Table 1, Kotaki et al., 1996). Maximum toxin levels were 0.8 μg g
–1
 (January 
1995) in scallops and 2.8 μg g
–1
 (November 1994) in mussels. These values were well below the 
regulatory action level of 20 μg g
–1
. This monitoring was performed monthly until 1997 and irregularly 
thereafter but since that time, no DA has been detected in shellfish. 
Fig. 2 Map of the monitoring sites. Monitoring of DA in shellfish and Pseudo-nitzschia were performed only at the 
Ofunato Bay station A (known for PSP toxins; Ogata et al., 1982). Monitoring of DA in shellfish after the 2011 
tsunami was performed at Ofunato Bay station A and Okirai Bay station B. Monitoring sites OKB: A–E (net tow),

Screening of domoic acid-producing diatoms 
Screening for DA-producing Pseudo-nitzschia was also performed in Ofunato Bay in 1994. Pennate 
diatoms were isolated from plankton net samples obtained at the same station (see Fig. 2) and cultured for 
the detection of DA by HPLC-fluorescence analysis (Pocklington et al., 1990). DA was analyzed two 
weeks after cells reached stationary growth, at about three to four weeks in culture, because it has been 
shown that DA content increases in the late stationary growth phase for some species of Pseudo-nitzschia 
(Bates et al., 1991). One out of 44 isolates showed a large peak identical to the known DA peak (Kotaki 
et al., 1999). The strain was mass cultured and confirmed to produce DA by electrospray ionization mass-
spectrometry (ESI/MS) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This isolate was morphologically 
identified as P. multiseries, the same species as identified in the Canadian ASP incident. The distribution 
of P. multiseries was assessed in Ofunato Bay and nearby Okirai Bay. All of the P. multiseries isolated 
from these locations were confirmed to produce high levels of DA in culture experiments. The cells grew 
from 1,000 cells mL
–1
 to approximately 100,000 cells mL
–1
 in one week, reaching a maximum of 
approximately 120,000 cells mL
–1
 at day 12 and decreasing gradually thereafter until the last day of 
culture (day 27; Fig. 3). DA did not increase much during the exponential growth phase. However, DA 
content started to increase one week after reaching the stationary growth phase and suddenly increased 
after two weeks in culture until the end of the culture, with a maximum DA concentration of 6.7 pg cell
–1
. 
High DA content was observed only in the late stationary growth phase.

Domoic acid-producing diatoms other than P. multiseries 
Ofunato Bay isolates of Pseudo-nitzschia were cultured for DA measurement using the same protocol as 
for P. multiseries, followed by morphological identification. Using HPLC-fluorescence analyses, the 
Pseudo-nitzschia species P. pseudodelicatissima, P. delicatissima, P. pungens, P. turgidula, 
P. fraudulenta, P. cuspidata, P. subpacifica, P. subfraudulenta, P. heimii and two unidentified Pseudo-
nitzschia-like pennate diatoms were confirmed to produce low levels of DA (< 1 pg cell
–1
) (Kotaki, 
2008).

Monitoring after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake  
A large tsunami that occurred following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake impacted Ofunato Bay and 
Okirai Bay. The habitat of Pseudo-nitzschia and their association with bacterial assemblages may have 
been altered in response to the tsunami. To estimate the ASP potential after this disaster, monitoring of 
DA in scallops and mussels was performed every three months at one station in both bays in 2013, 2014 
and 2015. At the same time, DA analysis was performed by HPLC with fluorescence detection on 
plankton net samples towed twice from 20 m depth at five stations in Okirai Bay and 2 to 4 stations in 
Ofunato Bay (Fig. 2). DA was not detected in any of the shellfish samples during the monitoring period. 
However, DA was detected in the plankton net tow samples at concentrations (converted to 1 L of 
seawater equivalent) of 45–330 pg L
–1
 (Ofunato Bay, September and October, 2013), 16–205 pg L
–1
 
(Okirai Bay, June and October, 2013), 7–163 pg L
–1
 (Ofunato Bay, Jun 2014 and January 2015), 17–154 
pg L
–1
 (Okirai Bay, May, June and August 2014), 7–720 pg L
–1
 (Ofunato Bay, September and December 
2015) and 33–56 pg L
–1
 (Okirai Bay, May 2015).  
Representative positive samples collected in 2014 and 2015 were further purified by a Sep-Pak C18 
cartridge and DA was confirmed by liquid chromatography/time-of-flight/tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-TOF MS/MS). An attempt was made to isolate Pseudo-nitzschia from each net sample. In 2013, 
three P. multiseries isolates showed low DA content (a mean DA concentration of 0.64 ± 0.38 pg cell
–1
) 
in culture experiments. In 2014, one isolate of P. multiseries was established and showed high DA 
content after five weeks in culture (314 ng mL
–1
, 9.0 pg cell
–1
). These results suggest that the origin of at 
least some of the DA in plankton net samples was P. multiseries. These results showed that although 
P. multiseries was present in both bays after the 2011 tsunami, this species did not bloom to high enough 
concentrations for significant levels of DA to be accumulated by shellfish. The ASP potential in both 
bays before and after the disaster appeared to be low. 
Factors affecting DA production 
The effects of nitrogen (NO
3 
+ NO
2
), phosphate (PO
4
), silicate (SiO
2
), and dissolved iron on DA 
production in batch culture experiments were investigated under axenic and non-axenic conditions. As 
shown in Fig. 4A, the growth of both axenic and non-axenic cultures was almost the same, reaching 
stationary growth phase after ~10 days and maintaining the same cell concentrations until the end of the 
culture experiment (37 days). However, DA production was very different between axenic and non-
axenic cultures. In non-axenic cultures, moderate DA production was seen immediately after reaching 
stationary phase and significant DA production was observed one week after reaching stationary growth 
(Fig. 5B and C). Changes in the four nutrients described above were measured and their relationship with 
DA production was assessed.

The changes in N and P did not appear to explain the difference in cellular DA content under axenic and 
non-axenic conditions. Significant decreases of Si and dissolved iron were observed and were almost 
depleted at 10 days both in axenic and non-axenic cultures. DA increased remarkably just after stationary 
growth was reached in non-axenic culture, while DA increased slightly three weeks after reaching 
stationary growth in axenic culture. This result shows the potential role of bacteria on DA production of 
P. multiseries. The remaining question was whether depletion of silicate or iron was correlated with DA 
production and associated with bacterial effects. The iron concentration in cells increased continuously 
during the exponential growth phase in axenic and non-axenic cultures. After reaching the stationary 
growth phase, iron concentrations did not increase but were maintained at the same level in the axenic 
culture while iron concentrations increased continuously in the non-axenic culture (insoluble iron became 
soluble and was taken into cells in non-axenic culture but not in axenic culture), indicating the possibility 
that bacteria might help P. multiseries cells acquire insoluble iron, resulting in DA production (or 
accumulation in the stationary phase when growth ceases).  
More supporting data were obtained by a 3-fold decrease in DA production after the addition of a 1× 
concentration of iron at 14 days.  Likewise, a 5- and 10-fold iron addition corresponded to the decrease in 
DA but this decrease was not correlated with added EDTA-Fe (Kotaki et al., 2004). 
As P. multiseries produced low levels of DA even under axenic conditions, intracellular bacteria were 
confirmed by measurement of bacterial rRNA genes in P. multiseries cells (Kobayashi et al., 2003). 
Amounts and species of bacteria appear to be important factors for the production of DA by P. multiseries. 
Discussion 
Monitoring of DA in shellfish and the screening of DA-producing diatoms were performed in Ofunato 
Bay after the Canadian ASP incident, resulting in detection of a small amount of DA in scallops and blue 
mussels. The pennate diatom P. multiseries was isolated and identified as the source of DA in shellfish 
from Ofunato Bay and Okirai Bay. DA production was investigated in batch culture experiments, 
showing that P. multiseries produces DA with a significant accumulation only in late stationary growth.  
Conditions necessary for ASP occurrence are: 1) presence of highly toxic Pseudo-nitzschia such as 
P. multiseries, 2) high abundance of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia, 3) sustenance of the bloom for more than 
two weeks with low nutrient supply (stress), 4) uptake of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia by shellfish, and 
5) consumption of the toxic shellfish by humans.  
Very few bays in Japan satisfy the above conditions, which apparently is the reason why ASP has not 
occurred, and the potential for ASP in Japan is low. Nine species of Pseudo-nitzschia isolated from 
Ofunato Bay and confirmed to be DA producers do not seem to contribute to ASP occurrences because of 
their very low toxin content. The National Government decided against continuing DA monitoring in 
shellfish in Japan after several years of monitoring concluded without detection of DA in excess of the 
regulatory limit (20 μg g
–1
). Environmental parameters related to ASP have not been measured in Japan 
for the same reason. Monitoring of DA in shellfish and Pseudo-nitzschia were performed for a number of 
years in Ofunato Bay and Okirai Bay after the East Japan tsunami in 2011. Monitoring of DA after this 
tsunami gave the results as before: the ASP potential seems to be low in eastern Japan coastal areas.  
DA production characteristics were further investigated in batch culture experiments using P. multiseries. 
The results of these experiments are: 1) cellular DA increases significantly only in late stationary growth 
Japan  Kotaki et al.

after nutrient depletion, 2) co-existing bacteria help facilitate DA production, 3) DA production appears 
to correlate with the uptake of insoluble iron into the P. multiseries cells, 4) bacteria may help with 
insoluble iron acquisition by P. multiseries cells.  
How bacteria help P. multiseries cells acquire insoluble iron is a remaining problem to be solved in the 
future. One possible idea is that bacteria make the siderophore-like DA or DA derivatives (Wells et al., 
2005) to help P. multiseries to assimilate insoluble iron in iron-deficient waters. The comparison of 
environmental parameters, including iron concentrations, will help to explain the immense differences in 
DA problems faced by countries in the eastern versus western Pacific coastal areas.

Sixteen blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia (including co-occurrence with other species) have been recorded 
since this species was first observed in 1987 along the Chinese coastline. The cumulative area in which 
these past blooms have been observed is 1,280 km

.  Blooms dominated by Pseudo-nitzschia were 
observed nine times and have not caused the death of marine life, or large economic losses. 
Pseudo-nitzschia species 
Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima 
There are four records of Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima blooms along China’s coastline, with three of 
them occurring in the East China Sea, in May, August, and September 2009 (Table 1). The recorded area 
of these three blooms was relatively small, with the largest area of only 25 km
2
. However, in May 2009, 
the bloom occurred together with Noctiluca scintillans, with a density of 2.0 × 10

 and in August 
2007, a Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima bloom coincided with Gymnodinium catenatum in an area of 
about 400 km

Pseudo-nitzschia pungens 
There have been nine blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia pungens in China’s coastal areas since 1987. Among 
them, five events were observed from May to September 2008 (Table 2). Six cases of P. pungens blooms 
occurred in the East China Sea, with a cumulative area greater than 830 km
2
. All these blooms occurred 
together with other species, such as the diatoms Eucampia cornuta, Thalassiosira rotula, Skeletonema 
costatum, and the dinoflagellates Prorocentrum donghaiense and Ceratium furca.  
From May 23–24, 2008, Prorocentrum donghaiense dominated but co-occurred with P. pungens, 
resulting in a bloom of 500 km
2
 near Ningbo Youcai Island in the East China Sea. From September 10–
13, 2008, P. pungens dominated with Skeletonema costatum causing a bloom of 200 km

 was recorded in the Yellow Sea . 
These blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia pungens were nontoxic and did not cause serious ecological and 
economic losses.

Newly recorded species of Pseudo-nitzschia in China 
New species of Pseudo-nitzschia were recorded in June 2000, September 2001, and July 2008. All these 
events were found near Shenzhen Bay, South China Sea. The scale of these blooms was small and did not 
cause obvious harm (Table 3). The blooms were caused by a mixture of species. Together with Pseudo-
nitzschia spp., the dominant species included Chaetoceros sp., Ceratium sp., Leptocylindrus danicus.

Research on Pseudo-nitzschia in China 
Morphology and taxonomy 
The earliest research on the genus Pseudo-nitzschia in China was in 1965, when two species, P. pungens 
and P. delicatissima, were observed by microscope, but classified as the genus Nitzschia (Chin et al., 
1965). Since then, 19 species of Pseudo-nitzschia have been identified and their distribution has been 
monitored throughout Chinese coastal waters as shown in Table 4. 
Ten Pseudo-nitzschia species were recently recorded in China and two P. sinica and P. micropora are 
new species that previously have not been observed anywhere in the world. In addition, two new records 
were described using morphological characteristics as well as a molecular phylogenetic tree based on 
sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) of P. galaxiae Lundholm & 
Moestrup and P. micropora Priisholm, Moestrup & Lundholm (Xu and Li, 2015). All strains of these two 
new species showed no DA content using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Pseudo-nitzschia pungens is a common, cosmopolitan species confined to coastal waters and has been 
sometimes reported to produce DA, the causative agent of amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP). Zhang et 
al. (1994) studied the subspecific taxonomy of Nitzschia pungens (Grunow) from the Yellow Sea. The 
samples were identified as Nitzschia pungens (Grunow f. pungens) but not N. pungens (Grunow f. 
multiseries). Pseudo-nitzschia pungens is ubiquitous in China, and forms blooms along the Chinese coast 
from north to south, in Dalian Bay, Jiaozhou Bay, Changjiang River Estuary, Xiamen Bay and Daya Bay. 
It commonly occurs in all seasons, but especially in the summer and fall (Lü and Qi, 1993; Zou et al., 
1993; Qi et al., 1994). Li (2010) did more research on the morphology and taxonomy of the Pseudo-
nitzschia genus in Chinese coastal waters and found that it formed two additional complexes: the 
P. pseudodelicatissima and P. americana complexes. 
Physiology and growth kinetics  
Chen et al. (2002) studied the dynamics of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and associated environmental factors in 
Daya Bay which is a semi-closed gulf in the South China Sea that has been developed as a mariculture 
base in Guangdong Province. Pseudo-nitzschia spp. are a common dominant species in this area. 
Seasonal changes of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. as well as the influences of environmental factors (especially 
nutrients) on the population dynamics were analyzed from July 1997 to June 1998. Chen et al. (2002) 
observed the genus in the bay throughout the year, and noted that cell concentrations were highest in 
People’s Republic of China  Guo et al. 
24 PICES Scientific Report No. 53 
spring and autumn.  Peak densities of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were observed at temperatures ranging from 
25.0–30.0 ℃ and salinity from 28.4–31.3‰. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and silicate were 
abundant in the bay while dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) appeared to be the limiting factor. The 
ratios of DIN, DIP, and Si are important for the growth of Pseudo-nitzschia and the optimal ranges of 
N:P, Si:P, Si:N are 6.21–32.98, 59.67–119.71, 3.36–17.89, respectively. 
Lü et al. (2006) analyzed the effects of nitrogen, phosphorus and N:P ratios on the growth of P. pungens 
collected and isolated from Daya Bay. Results showed that P. pungens is a nutrient-dependent species, 
and its growth is stimulated by high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. Therefore, the N:P ratio is another 
important factor to affect the population growth. The optimal N:P ratio for the growth of P. pungens 
ranges from 10–3. 
Qin et al. (2014) compared physiological characteristics of alkaline phosphatase (AP) in P. pungens and 
Aureococcus anophagefferens and showed that AP of P. pungens and A. anophagefferens was inducible 
and that the expression of AP activity was co-regulated by DIP and particulate phosphorus. The response 
of P. pungens to AP activity was more sensitive than that of A. anophagefferens. 
Ecology and Pseudo-nitzschia blooms 
Pseudo-nitzschia spp. can succeed at low temperatures due to their ability to obtain enough nutrients for 
growth, compared to dinoflagellates.  Population densities and relationships between Pseudo-nitzschia, 
phytoplankton and zooplankton were investigated daily from April to May, 2000, in Daya Bay (Chen et 
al., 2005). At the beginning of survey, species composition and densities of the planktonic community 
were low followed by the rapidly increasing growth of Pseudo-nitzschia with a maximum density of 2.93 
× 10
6
 cells L
–1
. Both P. pseudodelicatissima and P. pungens bloomed, and other diatoms and 
dinoflagellates were also enriched during this bloom. The authors determined that Pseudo-nitzschia was 
the most important component of the spring diatom bloom due to its competitive advantage over other 
species. The effect of zooplankton (especially copepods) top-down control on Pseudo-nitzschia was not 
significant because of reduced grazing pressure. This lack of grazing on Pseudo-nitzschia contributed to 
its success in the study area. 
 
Toxins and toxicology 
Pseudo-nitzschia species, including P. pungens, P. cuspidata, P. multistriata, P. brasiliana, P. galaxiae 
and P. micropora, isolated from the coast of China, showed either no measurable or only a trace of DA 
using HPLC; Li et al., 2002). Recently, traces of DA have been measured in some shellfish samples but 
not in seawater or freshwater (Table 5; Chen et al., 2001).  In May 2001, five species of shellfish samples 
normally collected and consumed in the Dalian area (the Yellow Sea) were analyzed by capillary 
electrophoresis with UV detection and only one species (Chlamys farreri) was found to contain DA  
(Table 6).

Summary 
1)  Sixteen cases of Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in China have been recorded from 1987 to the present, 
often co-occurring with other species. 
2)  The cumulative area in which these past blooms have been observed is 1,280 km
2
, and no death of 
marine life, or large economic loss, due to Pseudo-nitzschia has occurred. 
3)  Two or more Pseudo-nitzschia sp. may cause blooms in China, including P. delicatissima, 
P. pungens, as well as other newly recorded Pseudo-nitzschia species. 
4)  Some species of Pseudo-nitzschia in China may produce trace DA (but less than the regulatory limit 
of 20 µg g
–1
). 
5)  Due to the potential threat of DA production among Pseudo-nitzschia species, it is suggested that 
routine monitoring of these blooms should be intensified to protect seafood safety.

Since the first occurrence of Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in Masan Bay, Korea, in 1975, these blooms have 
been observed mostly in semi-closed bays (such as Jinhae, Deukryang). Since 1990, these blooms have 
been observed in coastal waters (e.g., near Jinhae, coastal ports, mouth of Nak-dong River; Lee, 1994). 
Despite observations of recurrent Pseudo-nitzschia blooms, amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) has not 
yet been reported in Korea. Koh and Kwon (2002) reported no detectable domoic acid (DA) in one 
gastropod species and 11 bivalve species which were sampled from May to December in 1999. 
Nationwide shellfish poisoning monitoring performed by the National Institute of Fisheries Science 
(NIFS) also showed that DA was rarely detected in Korean waters. DA has not been detected in any 
shellfish sample since 2009 (Table 1). In Korea, Cochlodinium polykrikoides and some other 
dinoflagellates are major research subjects as these harmful dinoflagellates are the primary causes of 
massive fish mortality. Because Pseudo-nitzschia bloom events and bloom periods have gradually 
decreased since the 1980s (Figs. 1 and 2), few studies have been conducted about boom dynamics and 
DA production by Pseudo-nitzschia species in Korea.

Lee (1994) compared the morphological characteristics between Pseudo-nitzschia pungens f. multiseries 
and P. pungens f. pungens sampled from 1974 to 1994 in the waters of southern Korea. Lee and Baik 
(1997) isolated and cultured P. multiseries from the waters of southern Korea, and detected 1.03 pg cell

DA in stationary phase cultures. Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries was dominant from April to May at a 
temperature range of 14.8°–19°C. 
Park et al. (2009) reported that 13 Pseudo-nitzschia species (P. americana, P. brasiliana, P. caciantha, 
P. calliantha, P. cuspidata, P. delicatissima, P. micropora, P. multiseries, P. multistriata, 
P. pseudodelicatissima, P. pungens, P. subfraudulenta and P. subpacifica) appeared in southeastern 
coastal waters in 2008 (Fig. 3). Only four species appeared in May, 12 species in September, and 
5 species in November (Table 2).  
Lim (2010) found that Pseudo-nitzschia cell density has fluctuated since 1987, with a possible decrease 
(Fig. 2). Pseudo-nitzschia blooms were highly correlated with rainfall. Cell density increased when 
silicate concentrations were high rather than when nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were high. 
High cell densities were frequently found in inner sea areas where an elevated inflow of fresh water from 
land occurred.

Lim (2010) reported that 14 species of Pseudo-nitzschia were observed in the southern East Sea and 
8 species were cultured in 2008 and 2009 (Table 3). The analysis of DA in seawater samples and cultures 
showed that 3 species of Pseudo-nitzschia, P. calliantha, P. multiseries and P. multistriata, produced DA. 
The concentrations of DA varied significantly throughout the year. The concentrations of DA were higher 
in eutrophic inner sea areas than in shellfish farm areas, and varied among Pseudo-nitzschia species.

6 Pseudo-nitzschia bloom events in the Russian waters of the 
Japan/East Sea

Introduction 
Pseudo-nitzschia monitoring in the northwestern Japan/East Sea has been conducted for over two decades 
by the Center for Monitoring of Harmful Algal Blooms and Biotoxins, the National Scientific Center of 
Marine Biology.  Phytoplankton species diversity and abundance have been studied since 1992 and 
domoic acid (DA) concentrations in diatoms and bivalve samples have been quantified since 2007.  
Pseudo-nitzschia is one of the most widespread and abundant microalgae groups capable of toxin 
production in the Russian waters of the Japan/East Sea where nine Pseudo-nitzschia species have been 
identified by light and electron microscopy (Stonik and Orlova, 2012). At least seven of these species 
(P. calliantha, P. delicatissima, P. fraudulenta, P. multiseries, P. multistriata, P. pungens, P. seriata) are 
known to produce DA in other parts of the world.  
Pseudo-nitzschia bloom events 
Blooms of P. calliantha, P. multiseries, P. multistriata and P. pungens have been observed in the Russian 
coastal waters of the western North Pacific in the summer and autumn with abundances exceeding 
1 million cells L
–1
 and constituting 75–98% of the total phytoplankton density (Stonik et al., 2011a). The 
most intensive Pseudo-nitzschia bloom events in Russian waters of the Japan/East Sea were registered 
from 1992–1997 (Stonik et al., 2001).  On a decadal timescale, there has been a sharp decrease in 
P. multiseries abundance (from 11.0 to 1.4 million cells L
–1
) from 1992–2002, and a shift from 
P. multiseries to P. calliantha and P. multistriata from 2002–2012 (Table 1).  For example, one of the 
potentially toxic diatom blooms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia was observed in October–November 2005 
in the northeastern part of Amur Bay in the coastal waters of Vladivostok  with salinity ranging from 31–
33.5‰ and water temperature from 6–12°С. The peak of Pseudo-nitzschia m u ltistria ta /с a llia n th a cell 
density (0.8·10
6
 cells L
–1
), recorded after heavy rains, was mainly caused by a massive bloom of P. 
multistriata (67% of total density) and P. calliantha (9%). A negative correlation was found between 
Pseudo-nitzschia spp. cell density and water salinity and NH
4
 concentration; a positive correlation was 
observed between diatom population density and water temperature (Stonik et al., 2012).

DA measurements in Pseudo-nitzschia laboratory cultures and bivalve 
samples 
In the summer and fall prior to 2002, Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries bloomed in Peter the Great Bay, with 
cell abundances exceeding 10
6
 cells L
–1
. Total DA was measured using high performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) with a fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl derivative (Pocklington et al., 1990) in 
“whole-culture” samples (cells plus medium) isolated during a P. multiseries bloom in 2002. Domoic acid 
was found in stationary-phase (days 20–35) cultures of P. multiseries isolated from Peter the Great Bay 
during fall 2002 when concentrations varied from 180–5390 ng ml
–1
, equivalent to 2 to 21 pg cell
–1
, 
which is in the range reported for other isolates of P. multiseries (Orlova et al., 2008). The Russian isolate 
showed greater ability to produce DA over time in culture. The change in toxicity over time could be 
related to changes in the bacterial composition in the diatom culture. A gamma proteobacterium 
(tentatively identified as Alteromonas macleodii) was isolated from P. multiseries strain PM-02, and has 
been shown to significantly enhance the DA concentration of an axenic culture of another strain of 
P. multiseries (S.S. Bates, I. Kaczmarska, C. Leger, J. Ehrman and D.H. Green, unpublished data).  
Concentrations of DA (up to 0.5 pg cell
–1
), determined using the “ASP direct ELISA” kit (Biosense 
Laboratories AS, Norway, AOAC official method 2006.02) were measured in cultures of P. calliantha, 
P. delicatissima, P. multistriata and P. pungens (Stonik et al., 2011b; Stonik, unpublished data). The 
monitoring of DA in shellfish collected from Peter the Great Bay during 2009–2013 showed that 
concentrations in tissues of the bivalves Mytilus trossulus, Crenomytilus grayanus and Mizuhopecten 
yessoensis ranged from 0.01–0.3 mg kg
–1
, well below the permissible regulatory limit of 20 mg kg
–1
 
(Stonik and Orlova, 2012). 
In summary, to date there have been no economic or social impacts connected with toxigenic Pseudo-
nitzschia blooms in Russian waters. However, the high concentrations of toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia 
species able to produce DA suggest a potential threat of future DA contamination in shellfish in the 
northwestern Japan/East Sea.

Coastal managers became keenly aware of the possibility of amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) in the 
northeastern Pacific region after sea lions and sea birds in Monterey Bay, California, showed symptoms 
of this poisoning (also called domoic acid poisoning) after ingesting sardines and anchovies filled with 
cells of Pseudo-nitzschia australis in 1991 (Scholin et al., 2000). Soon after this event, toxigenic Pseudo-
nitzschia blooms were identified as a problem in Washington State after the first closure of the razor clam 
fishery was announced in the same year. Harmful DA was identified after a shellfish manager from the 
Washington State Department of Health (WDOH), collected razor clams at Long Beach, Washington, for 
routine paralytic shellfish toxin testing.  When the shellfish homogenate was injected into a mouse at the 
lab, unusual behavior not characteristic of paralytic shellfish poisoning was noticed, including scratching 
behind the ear, a symptom of domoic acid (DA) poisoning. This observation was communicated to 
Canadian scientists, who first described DA in 1987, as a new toxin produced by Pseudo-nitzschia.  The 
shellfish sample was shipped to them for analysis, resulting in the confirmation of harmful levels of DA 
in Washington State shellfish for the first time in 1991. 
Since that year, DA closures have affected the commercial, recreational and tribal subsistence harvest of 
shellfish, including blue mussels, razor clams and Dungeness crabs in Oregon, Washington State, and 
British Columbia (BC), Canada, although the intensity and frequency of these closures vary spatially.  
Shellfish monitoring for public health safety is conducted on a regular basis by the WDOH, the Oregon 
Department of Agriculture, and the Canadian Shellfish Sanitation Program.  The analysis of razor clam 
tissue for DA content (Fig. 1) at two representative Washington State coastal beaches (Kalaloch and Long 
Beach; Fig. 2) from 1991–2017 illustrates the frequency of razor clam closure events.  Although toxic 
razor clams are frequently present at the central (Kalaloch Beach) and southern (Long Beach) sites, the 
level of toxicity varies, suggesting that physical processes impact bloom access to the coast from different 
source regions (described below).  It is interesting to note that during 2007–2014, no DA closures 
occurred on the Washington coast, but this non-bloom period was followed by the west coastwide 
Pseudo-nitzschia bloom in 2015 that had the highest economic impact (~$100 million economic loss to 
the Dungeness crab harvest alone; Lowther and Liddel, 2016) compared to previous toxic Pseudo-
nitzschia events (McCabe et al., 2016).

In British Columbia, DA levels have generally been lower than in the U.S. northeastern Pacific Ocean, in 
part due to the general lack of razor clams on the outer coast of BC. The first significant amount of DA 
detected in shellfish was in razor clams from Haida Gwaii in April 1992, and Dungeness crab viscera in 
western Vancouver Island inlets in August of the same year. Figure 3 shows the maximum monthly DA 
(Canadian Food Inspection Agency data) in samples from four separate areas on the BC coast: Haida 
Gwaii, West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI), East Coast Vancouver Island (ECVI), and the Central 
Coast (Fig. 4). DA levels in 1992 were the highest seen in B.C. to date; since 1995 shellfish from Haida 
Gwaii sites, primarily razor clams, are most commonly found to be contaminated although there have 
been distinct periods (spring 2002–winter 2004, spring 2008–spring 2012) where no DA was detected. In 
spring 2015, unusually high levels of DA were seen in samples from WCVI, and in November of that 
year, DA in mussel samples from ECVI were measured for the first time above the regulatory guidance 
level (50.4 µg g

, at Patricia Bay in Saanich Inlet).

Phytoplankton monitoring has been established to provide an early warning of harmful algal blooms 
(HABs) in the northeastern Pacific Ocean including the Monitoring of Oregon’s Coast for Harmful Algae 
(MOCHA), the Olympic Region HAB program (ORHAB, Washington State – for details on the ORHAB 
program methods, see Appendix 3 and www.orhab.org), the Harmful Algae Monitoring Program 
(HAMP, British Columbia, Canada), and the Southeast Alaska Tribal Toxins network (SEATT; 
www.seator.org).  Phytoplankton monitoring is not required as part of U.S. regulatory testing, but has 
been established through funding programs such as NOAA’s Monitoring and Event Response to HABs 
(MERHAB), through a small fee paid by shellfish farmers, and through a surcharge for shellfish license 
fees.  However, it has been difficult to maintain these important phytoplankton monitoring programs 
without consistent funding. 
Phytoplankton monitoring has helped scientists to establish the annual seasonality of Pseudo-nitzschia 
blooms, the species and their abundance associated with the most toxic events, and the potential source 
regions for these blooms.  In particular, the ORHAB program has a dataset of phytoplankton abundance 
established in 2000, allowing for the analysis of annual patterns in Pseudo-nitzschia.  The beaches at 
which phytoplankton samples are collected at least weekly by the Washington Department of Fish and 
Wildlife, the University of Washington’s Olympic Natural Resource Center, the Quinault Indian Nation, 
the Quileute Tribe and the Makah Tribe are shown in Figure 2.  In general, Pseudo-nitzschia blooms 
occur in the spring and late summer, and are now known to originate from the source regions, Heceta 
Bank and the Juan de Fuca Eddy.  The Pseudo-nitzschia species that have been present during the major 
toxic events on the Washington coast since 1998, their total maximum abundance, and the clamming days 
lost due to these events, are shown in Table 1.  Although several species have been observed, including 
P. heimii, P. pungens, P. delicatissima, P. fraudulenta, P. seriata, P. lineola, and P. multiseries, the two 
Pseudo-nitzschia species responsible for the major razor clam closures in Washington and Oregon are 
P. cf. pseudodelicatissima (recently identified as P. cuspidata by scanning (SEM) or transmission (TEM) 
electron microscopy; Lundholm et al., 2003) and P. australis.  Fewer Pseudo-nitzschia species have been 
identified in BC waters. Forbes and Denman (1991) reviewed the distribution of P. pungens and 
P. multiseries (as Nitzschia pungens f. pungens, and N. pungens f. multiseries) in samples taken from 
1980–1988. Samples were analyzed with a light microscope, so differentiation between the two forms 
was not possible; only one sample was examined using SEM, and in this sample P. f. pungens 
outnumbered f. multiseries by 25-fold. These researchers reported P. seriata from WCVI sites. P. 
australis and P. delicatissima have also been reported from Barkley Sound (WCVI; Taylor and Haigh, 
1996), with P. australis more common in early summer, and P. delicatissima, with P. pungens, in late 
summer and autumn. In 2015, Pseudo-nitzschia species seen in WCVI sites taking part in the Harmful 
Algae Monitoring Program (HAMP, see http://www.microthalassia.ca/hamp/) were P. australis, P. 
fraudulenta, P. pungens and P. cf. delicatissima.

A series of research cruises since 1997 has shown that toxic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms affecting the U.S. 
Pacific Northwest originate from source regions in the northeastern Pacific, including Point 
Conception/Santa Barbara Channel (California), Monterey Bay (California), Heceta Bank (Oregon), and 
the Juan de Fuca Eddy (Washington/BC) (Fig. 5).  These “hotspot” sites form during late spring through 
late summer and provide nutrients from upwelling and physical retention that enables phytoplankton 
growth and maintenance.  Often, these features are visible by satellite as regions of high chlorophyll and 
cooler upwelled water.  It has been shown that average cumulative upwelling (i.e., periods of moderate 
upwelling followed by moderate storms) was observed in summers when the Juan de Fuca Eddy was 
most retentive, and DA closures in coastal Washington occurred (compare Fig. 6 to Table 1).  In 1991, 
1998, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 (through late June) and 2016 the cumulative upwelling index was 
“average” compared to past years, shown in light gray (Fig. 6). In contrast, the 2015 springtime bloom 
was delivered to the coast by the anomalously warm nutrient-depleted waters (nicknamed “the Blob”; see 
description below), and a higher than average cumulative upwelling index was observed (Fig. 6, dotted 
purple line).

Fisheries Environmental Lab (https://www.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/PFEL/modeled/indices/upwelling/upwelling.html).  
Cumulative upwelling indices were derived by calculating a running total of the data for each year starting on May 1 
and ending on September 30.  Colored lines represent years where DA events occurred on the coast of Washington 
State and gray lines represent years where there were no DA events. 
The successful transport of Pseudo-nitzschia from the hotspot sites to beaches is influenced by the 
position and intensity of the Columbia River, the geographical boundary between Washington and 
Oregon, with the greatest discharge of any North American river entering the Pacific.  During the 
summer, or good-weather periods, the predominant direction of the Columbia River freshwater plume is 
southward and during the winter, or storm periods, the primary direction is northward (Fig. 7).  However, 
it can take days or even weeks for the Columbia River to respond to changing weather and at times the 
plume is bi-directional.  This freshwater gradient often acts as a barrier to Pseudo-nitzschia transport to 
the coast, sometimes resulting in higher concentrations of DA in shellfish at northern Washington State 
beaches (see razor clam DA in 1998 at Kalaloch Beach compared to Long Beach, Fig. 1).  However, at 
times, the plume can act as a conduit for Pseudo-nitzschia cell transport from Heceta Bank to the 
Washington coast (Hickey et al., 2013), resulting in toxic clams at Long Beach, but not Kalaloch Beach 
(Table 1; see spring 2017 closure at southern beaches only).

Data collected during five Ecology and Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms–Pacific Northwest 
(ECOHAB PNW) cruises have allowed scientists to determine the environmental factors correlated with 
toxic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms. These cruises confirmed that P. cf. pseudodelicatissima/cuspidata and 
P. australis are the primary species responsible for toxic events in Washington State while P. multiseries 
is also present at lower abundance (Table 2).  Environmental parameters consistently correlated with 
Pseudo-nitzschia abundance and particulate DA (pDA) in both the whole cruise grid and the Juan de Fuca 
Eddy region were Chl-a, and Si:P ratios  (Table 3).  However, it is important to remember that these 
factors were coincident with Pseudo-nitzschia and pDA measurements and were not necessarily factors 
that promoted the toxic blooms. In addition, the presence of pDA in the Juan de Fuca Eddy region 
appears to be elevated in regions of reduced iron (Trainer et al., 2009); this finding is supported by 
culture studies demonstrating linkage of DA with trace metal availability (Wells et al., 2005).

 P. cuspidata was identified using transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy of samples 
collected during the September 2004 ECOHAB PNW cruise, and subsequent cruises.  This is a new species resulting 
from the recent separation of P. pseudodelicatissima into three species (Lundholm et al., 2003). Therefore, 
P. cuspidata is not positively identified in samples prior to 2004 and the nomenclature psdeli is used. The species 
psdeli/deli are grouped together when they cannot be distinguished by SEM (modified from Table 2 in Trainer et al., 
2009).

Although toxigenic blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia have been demonstrated to initiate at offshore retentive 
sites, the large coastwide bloom that impacted the entire northeastern Pacific region in spring 2015 
challenged that paradigm.  During this event, the Blob, which approached the west coast of North 
America, contained low abundances of Pseudo-nitzschia cells.  Brought to the coast by a series of storms, 
these cells were met by a fresh supply of nutrients from upwelling.  The nutrient-starved Pseudo-nitzschia 
from the Blob were able to quickly assimilate these upwelled nutrients and develop into a massive bloom 
(McCabe et al., 2016).  In fact, attempts to collect zooplankton samples during cruises in April and May 
2015 failed because large, healthy chains of Pseudo-nitzschia, up to 165 cells per chain, clogged 
zooplankton nets (~200 µm mesh size).  The geographical extent of this Pseudo-nitzschia bloom and its 
impacts on DA concentrations in rock crab, Dungeness crab, mussels, razor clams, sardines and 
anchovies were unprecedented.  DA was measured even in the flesh of finfish, although at levels below 
the regulatory limit.  Even more disturbing is the documented relationship of DA closure events with 
warm water anomalies, including the Blob and El Niño events (McCabe et al., 2016; McKibben et al., 
2017), suggesting that DA events may become more prevalent as surface waters continue to warm. 
The economic impacts of DA events can be significant.  A study in coastal Washington by Dyson and 
Huppert (2010) showed that a year-long closure of the recreational razor clam harvest resulted in almost 
$25 million US in lost income, including over 400 jobs, lost wages and lost income for local businesses, 
tourism and recreation.  In contrast, the 2015 coastwide bloom event resulted in a direct economic impact 
to California alone of $48.3 million for Dungeness crab (representing 70% of the total estimated 
Northeastern Pacific Ocean Trainer et al. 
PICES Scientific Report No. 53  47 
commercial value) and $376,000 for rock crab (representing 37% of the total estimated value) from 
November 2015 through June 2016
1
.  The 2015 closure of the recreational razor clam fishery resulted in 
at least a $40.3 million loss in tourist-related spending in Washington
2
.  Oregon reported an estimated 
$5.8 million loss. The total loss to Dungeness crab harvest alone was estimated at $100 million (Lowther 
and Liddel, 2016).   
However, these estimates do not include economic losses due to public perceptions of unsafe seafood 
resulting from incomplete or insufficient information during this large bloom.  Education of coastal 
communities about HABs, their toxins, the retention and release of toxins from seafood, the nutritional 
value relative to the risk of low-level toxins in this seafood and the impacts of climate change on blooms, 
is more important now than ever.  Efforts to study the large 2015 west coastwide bloom and its impact on 
different communities will provide a resource to shellfish consumers and enable them to adapt and 
become more resilient during future blooms.

Abstract 
 
There is clear evidence of contrasting occurrence and impacts of the toxin-producing diatom, Pseudo-
nitzschia, between the western and eastern Pacific.  In 2015, a massive bloom spanning from California to 
Alaska, had major impacts on the economic viability shellfish industry and on wildlife health.  In 
contrast, Pseudo-nitzschia are not highly toxic and do not cause economic losses in the western Pacific. 
These data provide a unique opportunity for east–west Pacific comparisons to identify and rank those 
environmental factors that promote harmful algal bloom (HAB) success at different times. The recent 
PICES-funded workshop on HABs and Climate Change emphasized the importance of studying such 
extreme events to further our understanding of climate impacts. This workshop will focus on Pseudo-
nitzschia—a diatom that historically had massive economic impacts in the eastern PICES member 
countries, with low or no impacts in the western Pacific. The workshop foundation will be an extension of 
the current dataset to the 1990s and earlier where available, with PICES participants pre-submitting 
available data on: HAB species presence, maximum abundance, toxicity, optimal conditions for growth, 
time of year, temperature range, salinity range, water clarity, nutrients, wind, river flow (flooding), and 
upwelling indices.

ORHAB sampling methods  Appendix 3 
52 PICES Scientific Report No. 53 
Appendix 3  
Olympic Region Harmful Algal Bloom (ORHAB) partnership sampling 
methods 
1. Collect whole water and net tow samples twice weekly (March 1–October 31) and once weekly 
(November 1–February 28).  The number of sample sites as well as sample frequency may be increased 
when Pseudo-nitzschia (PN) and domoic acid (DA) are present. One L of whole water is filtered onto a 
Nucleopore HA filter (0.45 µm pore size) and frozen at –80
o
C until analyzed for particulate DA (pDA). 
2. Count settled whole water samples for total PN.  When >50,000 large PN cells L
–1
 or >1 million 
small PN cells L
–1
 are observed, State managers are notified that PN abundance is over the “action 
level” and a test for particulate DA is performed as soon as possible using the Mercury Science 
DAK-36 enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).   If it is apparent from net tow samples that 
PN abundance may be above the action level, samplers may run an ELISA for pDA prior to counting 
PN from whole water which often need to be settled overnight. 
3. If ELISA results for pDA are >200 ng L
–1
, state managers are notified and an ELISA is run on 
shellfish samples (in Washington State, razor clam samples are the primary shellfish species analyzed 
because they can retain DA for many months). Composite razor clam samples (a composite of 12 
individual clams when possible) are analyzed for DA using ELISA.  If ELISA results show elevated 
levels of DA in shellfish, additional tissue samples are also sent to the Public Health Lab for analysis 
of DA by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; the standard regulatory method).  
4. Mercury Science
4
 DA ELISAs allow individual particulate (cellular) DA filters to be tested in 
duplicate in strips – up to ~12 individual samples per ELISA plate because a full standard curve is 
analyzed with each sample at a total cost of ~$250.  Biosense
5
 ELISA can also be used, but these cost 
~$500 per plate for fewer samples. The Mercury Science ELISA is not Association of Analytical 
Communities (AOAC) or Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference (ISSC) approved.  This method 
is used to screen for DA; positive tests must be confirmed by approved regulatory methods for 
detection of DA in shellfish.  Emergency closures can be enacted by using screening methods, while 
reopening of shellfish beds after closure requires testing using approved methods. 
5. Depending on the timing of the scheduled razor clam openers, the timing of the observed PN bloom 
and the ability of the coastal ORHAB samplers to run immediate ELISA, pre-emptive closures may 
be decided upon by the Washington State Department of Health and the Washington Department of 
Fish and Wildlife.  However, this is rare.  Closures are enacted when a value of 20 ppm or greater in 
razor clam is measured by HPLC.
