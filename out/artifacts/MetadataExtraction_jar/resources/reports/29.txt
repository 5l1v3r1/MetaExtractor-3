Executive Summary 
 
In October 2003, the PICES Science Board established, under the direction of the Fishery Science (FIS) 
and Marine Environmental Quality (MEQ) Committees, the Study Group on Ecosystem-based 
management science and its application to the North Pacific, with the following terms of reference:  
 
1. Review and describe existing and anticipated ecosystem-based management initiatives in PICES 
member nations and the scientific bases for them;  
2. Identify emerging scientific issues related to the implementation of ecosystem-based management; 
and  
3. Develop recommendations for a Working Group to focus on one or more issues identified.  This is the 
final report of the Study Group. 
 
Summaries of each country’s approach to ecosystem-based management (EBM) are provided, and in 
reviewing these summaries, it is immediately obvious that EBM challenges are different between China, 
Japan and Korea vs. Russia, Canada and the United States.  The greater coastal populations in the former 
three countries, coupled with their much longer history of full exploitation of most harvestable renewable 
resources, meant that EBM is, initially at least, focused on (1) minimising existing impacts, (2) rebuilding 
depleted stocks to more acceptable levels, and (3) in near-shore areas in particular, minimising 
widespread impacts in the marine environment from land runoff from both industrial and urban 
developments.  In contrast, in the latter three countries, human coastal populations and development were 
generally much less, with fishing impacts and offshore oil and gas development and transport identified as 
the major impacts.  In many instances, relatively unimpacted, pristine habitat and biological communities 
still existed, and so the challenges there were often how to maintain them while permitting appropriate 
new economic activity to occur. 
 
Many human activities are documented as impacting the marine environment (e.g., fishing, mariculture, 
oil and gas exploration and development, pollution from land-based activities, disruption of freshwater 
discharges by urbanisation, etc.), but the most comprehensive databases (e.g., target species landings, 
bycatch and discard characteristics, habitat disruption, etc.) as to how these impacts are affecting marine 
ecosystems are related to fishing activities.  Hence, much initial reporting of ecosystem impacts has been 
focused on documenting and addressing fishery impacts.  A standardised PICES reporting framework that 
describes human activity impacts is needed for comparative purposes.  Ideally, its format should be robust 
enough to address the increasing number of environmental and other requirements imposed by legislation, 
certification schemes, and consumer and community demands.  It should also capture ecosystem effects 
resulting from most human activities, and describe how these ecosystem effects are being monitored. 
Ecosystem parameters already, or potentially, being monitored may be capturing environmental change, 
without linking this change back to the specific human activity, or activities, that in fact might be causing 
the change (e.g. increasing sea water temperature may be the result of many causes, some of which relate 
to human activities).  In some cases, additional research may need to be undertaken to determine linkages. 
 
The Study Group recommended to establish, under the direction of FIS and MEQ, a Working Group on 
Ecosystem-based management and its application to the North Pacific (WGEBM) with a 3-year duration 
and the following terms of reference: 
 
1. Describe and implement a standard reporting format for EBM initiatives (including more than fishery 
management) in each PICES country, including a listing of the ecosystem-based management 
objectives of each country; 
vi 
2. Describe relevant national marine ecosystem monitoring approaches and plans and types of models 
for predicting human and environmental influences on ecosystems.  Identify key information gaps 
and research and implementation challenges; 
3. Evaluate the indicators from the 2004 Symposium on “Quantitative Ecosystem Indicators for 
Fisheries Management” for usefulness and application to the North Pacific; 
4. Review existing definitions of “eco-regions” and identify criteria that could be used for defining 
ecological boundaries relevant to PICES; 
5. Hold an inter-sessional workshop that addresses the status and progress of EBM science efforts in the 
PICES region, with the deliverable being either a special journal issue or a review article;  and  
6. Recommend to PICES further issues and activities that address the achievement of EBM in the 
Pacific.

1. Introduction 
 
Under the overarching objective of conservation of 
species and habitat, ecosystem-based management 
(EBM) is the implementation of defined objectives 
related to maintaining and monitoring biodiversity, 
productivity and physical and chemical properties 
of an ecosystem.  EBM world-wide is now 
recognised as both timely and necessary because 
1) in many environments, individual ecosystem 
components are presently being utilised, harvested 
or impacted with limited attention to the 
maintenance of the integrity of the overall 
ecosystem, and 2) the scale of these impacts is 
now such that there is real danger of overall 
negative ecosystem change to the detriment of 
human society.  The concept of an EBM Working 
Group within PICES was first proposed at the 
PICES Eleventh Annual Meeting in Qingdao, in 
2002.  At that meeting, the PICES Science Board 
indicated that the preferred first step would be to 
hold a Topic Session on ecosystem-based 
management and use recommendations from 
session participants as advice for future direction.  
 
Many new national and international legal 
agreements use some form of the term 
“ecosystem-based approaches” when describing 
new methods to assess and manage marine living 
resources.  These are usually understood to include 
objectives related to maintaining and monitoring 
ecosystem features such as biodiversity, 
productivity and the physical and chemical 
properties of an ecosystem.  However, it is often 
unclear what this means in practice, what new 
information will be required, and in fact whether 
scientific or management actions will actually 
change under these new approaches.  A PICES 
EBM Session (convenors:  Glen Jamieson 
(Canada), Patricia Livingston (U.S.A.), Vladimir 
Radchenko (Russia), Takashige Sugimoto (Japan), 
Qi-Sheng Tang (People’s Republic of China) and 
Chang-Ik Zhang (Republic of Korea)) was 
subsequently held at the Twelfth Annual Meeting 
in Seoul, in 2003, and recommendations were 
provided to establish a Working Group to focus on 
how both natural variability and changes arising 
from fishing and other activities on ecosystem 
characteristics could be monitored.  Determining 
how biological communities can be effectively 
measured and monitored was deemed a necessary 
prerequisite to the meaningful assessment of how 
organisation of a community might be being 
altered by any proposed human activity.  
However, the Science Board felt that these 
objectives were still too broad, and to facilitate the 
development of acceptable terms of reference for a 
Working Group, established instead a Study 
Group on Ecosystem-based management science 
and its application to the North Pacific, with the 
following terms of reference: 
 
1. Review and describe existing and anticipated 
ecosystem-based management initiatives in 
PICES member nations and the scientific 
bases for them;  
2. Identify emerging scientific issues related to 
the implementation of ecosystem-based 
management; 
3. Develop recommendations for a Working 
Group to focus on one or more issues 
identified. 
 
This is the final report of the Study Group.

2. Overview of international EBM history 
 
Since the industrial revolution, man’s impact on 
the oceans has increased dramatically, this being 
especially true in recent years.  In near-shore 
coastal areas, human population growth has led to 
increasing pollution and habitat modification.  
Fishing effects have become increasingly severe, 
with many, if not most, traditionally harvested 
populations now either fully exploited or over-
fished (Garcia and Moreno, 2003).  Thus far, 
management of these activities has been primarily 
sector-focused.  For instance, fisheries have 
generally been managed in isolation of the effects 
of other influencing factors, and have targeted 
commercially important species, without explicit 
consideration of non-commercial species and 
broader ecosystem impacts.  There is an increasing 
international awareness of the cumulative impacts 
of sector-based activities on the ecosystem 
(Jennings and Kaiser, 1998; Kaiser and De Groot, 
2000) and the need to take a more holistic or 
ecosystem-based management (EBM) approach 
(Anon., 1999; Kabuta and Laane, 2003; Link, 
2002) to ensure the sustainability of marine 
ecosystems.  Globally, there is an emerging 
paradigm shift in our approach to ocean 
management and usage (Sinclair and 
Valdimarsson, 2003). 
 
The roots of this change can be found in the 1992 
UN Conference on Environment and Development 
(UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, itself emanating from 
the 1982 UN Conference on the Law of the Sea, 
which, in turn, resulted in the UN Convention on 
the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).  UNCED 
highlighted the need to consider resource 
management in a broader biological, socio-
economic and institutional context.  This led to 
follow-up conferences and conventions, such as 
the 1993 Convention on Biological Diversity, the 
1995 Agreement for the implementation of 
provisions of the UNCLOS relating to the 
Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish 
Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks 
(UNFA), and the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for 
Responsible Fisheries, to name a few.  FAO has 
put in place International Plans of Action to meet 
UNCED objectives, progress against which were 
reviewed in Johannesburg at the Rio +10 meeting 
in August 2002.  Thus, there is a growing body of 
international legislation in support of ecosystem-
based management. 
 
One of the major challenges of Integrated 
Management (IM) is harmonization of the 
activities of various ocean sectors (e.g., fisheries, 
oil and gas development, aquaculture, recreational 
tourism etc.).  Past management approaches have 
tended to manage such sectors in isolation of one 
another.  Integrated Management requires that 
management of all sectors work towards 
commonly defined goals that guide the activities 
of all industries within an area.  This puts all 
sectors on the “same rules” basis. 
 
There is an emerging consensus that management 
goals need to be considered at both the conceptual 
and operational level (Garcia and Staples, 2000, 
Sainsbury and Sumaila, 2003).  Conceptual 
objectives (Jamieson et al., 2001; Sainsbury and 
Sumaila, 2003) are stated in broad, general terms 
intended to be understandable by a general 
audience, and tend to be valid for long time 
periods (O’Boyle, 1993).  Policy statements by a 
government or organization, for instance, can be 
considered conceptual objectives.  Given that they 
are broad statements, there is, however, a 
possibility that they will be interpreted differently 
by different people.  In addition, they lack the 
specificity to be operational, i.e., result in a 
particular management action based upon the 
degree of divergence of a measurable indicator 
from a pre-determined reference point (more on 
this below).  Operational objectives are the 
strategies by which the conceptual objectives are 
actually implemented.  Jamieson et al. (2001) 
considered that an operational objective consisted 
of a verb (e.g., maintain), a specific measurable 
indicator (e.g., biomass), and a reference point 
(e.g., 50,000 t), thus allowing an action statement 
for management (e.g., maintain biomass of a given 
forage species greater than 50,000 t biomass).  
This extends current definitions of operational 
objectives in the literature (Anon., 2003; 
Sainsbury and Sumaila, 2003).

3. Canada 
 
3.1 Overview 
 
In Canada, the Fisheries Act, first enacted in 1857, 
has been to date the prime legislative vehicle 
governing ocean usage, particularly fishing.  It 
regulates the capture, holding and possession of all 
marine life, and makes unlawful the harmful 
alteration, disruption or destruction of fish habitat.  
While it is periodically revised (most recently in 
1991), the focus of the Fisheries Act has been the 
conservation and protection of commercially 
exploited species and their habitat.  Similarly, the 
Coastal Fisheries Protection Act regulates the 
presence of foreign fishing vessels in Canadian 
fisheries waters.  Responding to both international 
legislative changes, as well as concerns for the 
impacts of human activities on its marine 
ecosystems, Canada enacted the Oceans Act in 
1997.  The Oceans Act outlined a new approach to 
managing oceans and their resources based on the 
premise that oceans must be managed as a 
collaborative effort amongst all stakeholders that 
use the oceans, and that new management tools 
and approaches are required.  While fishery 
management plans under the Fisheries Act 
continue to focus on target species, the Oceans Act 
has changed the legislative basis for management 
and now requires consideration of the impacts of 
all human activities on Canada’s ecosystems in 
marine resource management plans. 
 
While Canada’s Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans (DFO) had been active in addressing 
habitat impact issues (e.g., oil and gas resource 
development in Atlantic Canada), the Oceans Act 
has provided a new tool in Canada’s development 
of an EBM approach.  As a consequence, since 
1997, there have been a number of initiatives 
through which Canada’s approach to EBM is 
beginning to emerge.  In 2002, the Canada’s 
Oceans Strategy was published (Anon., 2002a), a 
key element of it being a nationally co-ordinated 
Integrated Management program, in which 
interested stakeholders and regulators work 
together to decide on how to best manage 
designated geographic areas (Anon., 2002b).  In 
support of the IM program, DFO has established a 
national coordinating body, termed the Working 
Group on Ecosystem Objectives (WGEO), to 
facilitate the development of best practices for IM 
and oversee regional pilot projects designed to test 
implementation of the concepts.  For instance, in 
1998, a pilot project was established in DFO’s 
Maritime Region to facilitate EBM in the Atlantic 
Ocean on the Eastern Scotian Shelf, with a 
Strategic Planning Framework recently produced 
(Anon., 2003).  Similarly, DFO’s Pacific Region 
joined the Province of British Columbia in 
initiating the Central Coast Land and Coastal 
Resource Management Plan (CCLCRMP) process, 
and has established the pilot Central Coast 
(CCIM) project in another IM thrust.  The WGEO 
was instrumental in planning a national workshop 
(Jamieson et al., 2001), termed herein as the 
Sidney workshop) in 2001 to outline the objectives 
to guide EBM and more recently, has initiated an 
exercise to define scientifically-based eco-region 
boundaries within which ecosystem objectives 
(EOs) will be established.  Human activities will 
be managed in Large Ocean Management Areas 
(LOMAs) in a manner that will allow the 
conceptual EOs to be met for a specific LOMA in 
the eco-region.  
 
3.2 Activities to date 
 
When the Oceans Act was proclaimed in 1997, 
there was little concept in Canada as to what IM 
actually meant in practical terms, not unlike the 
situation in other counties.  Much of the dialogue 
had been at a higher policy level with little linkage 
to implementation.  Since then, there has been 
much discussion on implementation both in 
Canada and elsewhere, with various approaches 
starting to emerge (e.g., Garcia and Staples, 2000; 
Pajak, 2000; Sainsbury and Sumaila, 2003).  Here, 
we summarise the Canadian perspective on 
Integrated Management, based on our experiences 
with EBM in Canada (O’Boyle and Jamieson, 
2004).  
 
IM has been defined in Canada as “a commitment 
to planning and managing human activities in a 
comprehensive manner while considering all 
factors necessary for the conservation and 
sustainable use of marine resources and the shared 
6 
use of ocean spaces” (Anon., 2002a).  IM 
acknowledges the interrelationships that exist 
among different uses and the environments they 
potentially affect (Anon., 2002b).  It thus involves 
many facets relating to both what activities are 
undertaken and to how these are undertaken. 
 
It should be pointed out here that the Oceans Act 
refers to Marine Environmental Quality (MEQ) 
objectives, which are to be incorporated in IM 
plans to facilitate implementation of an ecosystem 
approach.  MEQ objectives are functionally 
synonymous with the definition of operational 
objectives stated above.  In this report, we will use 
the terms “conceptual and operational” as they are 
more in line with usage in the literature. 
 
How the conceptual and operational levels of 
objectives are linked is a critical issue.  Jamieson 
et al. (2001) considered components and sub-
components associated with the high level 
conceptual objectives, thus creating a “branched 
tree” of conceptual objectives.  For example, they 
stated that diversity and productivity are 
components of the “conservation objective” and 
under diversity, there are sub-components at the 
community, species and population level.  For 
each component and sub-component, a conceptual 
sub-objective is stated (e.g., for the diversity 
component, conserve population diversity so that 
it does not deviate outside the limits of natural 
variability).  Jamieson et al. (2001) then provided 
example operational objectives (verb, indicator 
and reference point as described above) linked to 
each conceptual objective.  These were primarily 
included to indicate to intent of the associated 
conceptual objective.  
 
Jamieson et al. (2001) translated each of the sub-
objectives into operational objectives through a 
process termed “unpacking” (Fig. 3.1).  
Unpacking involves considering each conceptual 
objective associated with a component / sub-
component and determining whether or not a final 
operational objective can be stated.  In other 
words, can a measurable indicator and reference 
point (see Appendix 10.2 for definitions) be 
associated with that sub-objective?  This requires 
an understanding of what knowledge and 
information is available upon which indicators and 
reference points can be based.  If this information 
is available, then the unpacking process stops and 
the final operational objective associated with that 
conceptual objective is defined.  Otherwise, a 
further unpacking occurs which is again tested for 
it being a final operational objective.  The 
unpacking stops when all conceptual objectives 
have been addressed.  As mentioned above, 
Canada’s Oceans Strategy (Anon., 2002b) refers to 
Marine Environmental Quality objectives.  Both of 
these terms are synonymous with the operational 
objectives that would go in management plans.  
 
3.3 Integrated Management implementation 
in Canada 
 
Integrated Management is still in its initial stages 
in Canada.  While progress has been made in some  
 
Conceptual Objectives Operational Objective

Fig. 3.1 The link between conceptual objectives and operational objectives.  With the “maintenance of 
productivity” as an example conceptual objective, beginning to unpack it creates the statements as 
maintaining trophic transfers and interactions within the foodweb.  However, while this restatement is a 
more tractable concept than maintenance of productivity, it is still far from what managers can deal with 
practically.  Therefore, the concept of “trophic transfers” is further unpacked.  This produces a more 
specific statement on the maintenance of forage species, and then, in turn, of target escapement.  A point 
is finally reached where some component of the ecosystem is associated with a particular measure or 
indicator, and at this point, the objective can be termed operational. 
7 
areas, much remains to be done.  Jamieson et al. 
(2001) summarized the recommended next steps to 
achieving IM in Canada. 
 
3.3.1 Objectives, indicators and reference points 
 
There is a need to develop objectives for the other 
dimensions of sustainability (social, economic, 
and cultural) through workshops involving the 
appropriate experts.  Whereas biology is relatively 
well circumscribed and objective, these other 
dimensions of sustainability tend to be driven by 
regional and local issues and can be politically 
charged.  
 
3.3.2 Assessment approaches 
 
A technical review of ecosystem assessment 
approaches is required, considering their 
performance and sensitivity through simulation 
exercises using existing and simulated data.  
 
3.3.3 Research directions for the future 
 
There is a continuing need for research to define 
indicators and reference points related to each 
objective, including consideration of their 
practicality, the extent to which measurements can 
separate real change form background variability, 
cost of measurement, and so on.  The direction of 
this research would greatly benefit from unpacking 
case study exercises to identify appropriate 
indicators and reference points for management, 
which would identify gaps on our knowledge to 
supply this information.  This research needs to 
build on international initiatives such as the SCOR 
WG 119 on Quantitative Ecosystem Indicators for 
Fisheries Management.  
 
Also, relatively little effort has been put into how 
one would use suites of indicators to meet the 
totality of objectives defined under operational 
resource management plans.  Such an exercise is 
being undertaken on the Eastern Scotian Shelf 
(O’Boyle et al., 2004), where a number of ocean 
sectors - fishing, oil and gas exploration, transport, 
defense - utilize the area, typical of situations both 
in Canada and elsewhere in the world.  A 
standardized operational framework for Integrated 
Management will thus be of global interest.  The 
suite of national conceptual ecosystem-level 
objectives has been unpacked to a regional level 
for the ESSIM area to address biodiversity, 
productivity and habitat issues.  Operational 
objectives, which identify an indicator and 
reference point, associated with each conceptual 
objective, have then been proposed.  Utilizing 
Canada’s conceptual objectives unpacking 
protocol, individual ocean sector plans and 
activities can then be reviewed in a consistent 
manner to determine how they might be 
influenced by the conservation objectives for the 
area.  Issues of spatial scale and cumulative 
impacts are addressed as required and comment is 
made on how progress against the suite of 
objectives could be reported. 
 
Based on these experiences, it is suggested that the 
following sequential steps are required to 
effectively make the linkage between the high 
level national objectives and operational 
objectives necessary for implementation of IM: 
 
1. Identification of the conservation issues 
relevant to the IM area; 
2. Identification of the ecosystem components to 
be conserved and the associated conservation 
objective; 
3. Determination of the appropriate ocean sectors 
to implement the conservation objective; 
4. Definition of operational objectives for the IM 
area;  and 
5. Definition of operational objectives for each 
ocean sector. 
 
Once the operational objectives are available, 
monitoring programs can be designed to provide 
the indicators and reference points for assessment 
and decision making.  
 
3.3.4 Management directions for the future 
 
Before Integrated Management can be 
implemented in Canada, concepts and approaches 
need to be “tested” in pilot-scale initiatives.  Only 
through a nationally co-ordinated system of pilot 
studies would the challenges, opportunities and 
utility of different approaches be operationally 
evaluated for consideration in the development of 
a national approach.  Such exercises would need to 
include: 
8 
null Synthesis of all currently available 
information, including socio-economic data; 
null Practical experiences in actually compiling 
ecosystem-level data and their utilisation in 
ecosystem function measurements, to allow 
comparison of experiences from different 
situations; 
null Practical experience with regional 
“unpacking” exercises to break down 
conceptual objectives to operational ones; and  
null An assessment of the costs of conducting 
required ecosystem monitoring.  
 
Since the Sidney workshop, many of the above 
recommendations have been, or are, in the process 
of being acted upon.  Pilot IM projects have been 
established to “test” the concepts discussed at the 
workshop, including the “unpacking” exercises 
(e.g., Jamieson et al., 2003; O’Boyle and Keizer, 
2003; Jamieson and McCorquodale, 2004) to test 
the efficacy of the objectives’ structure and the 
unpacking process reported above.  These pilots 
involve consideration of how best to engage 
managers, clients and scientists in consultation and 
decision-making.  It will take time for results of 
these pilots to be realised and to determine how 
the concepts and approaches discussed by 
Jamieson et al. (2001) can be implemented over 
the long-term.

4.1 Overview 
 
Ecosystem-based management is a backbone of 
current Japanese ocean and fisheries policies.  
These policies are mainly focusing on the 
following two points:  (1) environmental 
conservation and sustainable development of 
Japanese coastal zones, including coastal waters 
and land along the coast; and (2) conservation of 
biodiversity and sustainable use of marine living 
resources around Japan.  However, there has been 
no single government agency that jointly plans and 
implements these policies, as does the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the 
United States of America and the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans in Canada.  Therefore, 
various policies including water quality control 
and waste regulation in coastal waters, mitigation 
for degraded and destroyed ecosystems, and the 
sustainable development of capture fisheries and 
aquacultures have been independently planned and 
implemented by different agencies.  A lack or 
insufficiency of interaction among relevant 
agencies has often created political conflict 
between agencies advocating economic 
development versus environmental conservation.  
This is a particularly serious problem in coastal 
areas where many industries and human 
settlements occur. 
 
As part of international discussions in the 1990s 
on conservation of biodiversity of species and 
ecosystems, the Japanese government passed the 
Basic Environmental Law in 1993.  Since then, 
more essential discussion and some actual 
implementation of ecosystem-based management 
for fisheries and the ocean have started.  Under the 
authorities of the Fisheries Basic Law of 2001 and 
related laws, marine capture fisheries and 
aquacultures have been regulated to meet the goal 
of sustainable development in harmony with 
environmental protection and ecosystem 
conservation.  To harmonize sustainable 
development and environmental conservation in 
coastal zones, regulations to minimise various 
environmental impacts from land-based activities 
are being developed, along with simultaneous 
actions to minimise environmental degradation in 
coastal waters.  Recently, the idea of integrated 
coastal zone management, which jointly addresses 
issues in both coastal waters and on land, has been 
proposed by relevant governmental and non-
governmental organizations. 
 
To achieve success with ecosystem-based 
management in Japan, it is essential to promote 
scientific activities that allow for a better 
understanding of ecosystems, i.e., structure, 
function, and resilience to human activities; and 
responses to natural environmental variability, 
such as from periodic ocean climate change.  
Recently, the Fisheries Agency and the Fisheries 
Research Agency of Japan have expanded research 
activities to seek mechanistic linkages between 
fishery stocks and ambient ecosystem parameters.  
International discussions on this topic are also 
essential.  Invasions and settlement of non-native 
and harmful organisms from the introduction of 
aquaculture species and ballast water discharge 
have adversely affected Japanese coastal 
ecosystems and the biodiversity of native 
populations.  Recent environmental issues in 
Japanese coastal waters include severe harmful 
algae and jellyfish blooms, invading non-native 
species, and the expanded spread of diseases, and 
these issues are also increasingly common to 
countries around the marginal seas of the North 
Pacific.  Collaborative effort is needed for 
monitoring ecosystem changes, detecting causal 
factors, and coordinating counter measures among 
these countries. 
 
4.2 Conservation and sustainable use of 
marine living resources  
 
Sustainable use is a traditional objective of 
Japanese fishers.  Based on this, they have 
practiced community-based fisheries management 
in coastal common areas and even, to some extent, 
in offshore fisheries.  During recent decades some 
stocks around Japan have nevertheless become 
depleted by overexploitation.  After the ratification 
of the United Nations Convention on the Law of 
the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1996, the Fisheries Agency 
has restructured domestic management institutions 
and has started practicing a more conservative 
10 
management in the Japanese Exclusive Economic 
Zone (EEZ).  Present management approaches 
include harvest control by regulating total 
allowable catch (TAC), effort regulations based on 
stock recovery plans, and stock enhancement by 
releasing hatchery produced juveniles.  
 
4.2.1 Harvest control by TAC system 
 
Harvest control by a TAC system was introduced 
into Japanese domestic fishery management in 
1997.  More than 80 stocks of nearly 40 species 
found largely in the EEZ are assessed every year 
and an acceptable biological catch (ABC) with 
precautionary management options is calculated.  
Since 1998, TACs have been set for eight species:  
Pacific saury (Cololabis saira), walleye pollock 
(Theragra chalcogrammus), jack mackerel 
(Trachurus japonicus), Japanese sardine 
(Sardinops melanostictus), chub mackerel 
(Scomber japonicus), spotted mackerel (Scomber 
australasicus), Japanese common squid 
(Todarodes pacificus), and snow crab 
(Chinoecetes opilio).  The total catch of these 
eight species was 1.5 million tons in 1998, about 
30% of Japan’s total harvest from marine capture 
fisheries and 50% of the landings from offshore 
fisheries.  Adopted TACs values consider both 
socio-economic conditions in related fisheries and 
ABC projections. 
 
TAC setting tries to take into account interactions 
among species.  With present stock assessments, 
environmental factors are considered because most 
TAC species have large population fluctuations 
with ocean climate variations.  In addition, mass-
balance model analyses of food web structure and 
specific prey-predator interactions, including some 
marine mammals, have been developed for the 
northern Pacific region and the East China Sea.  
However, these analyses are still too preliminary 
to be included along in stock assessments and 
ABC calculations.  It is hoped that the recent 
expansion of studies to seek mechanistic linkages 
between fishery stocks and ambient ecosystems by 
the Fisheries Agency and the Fisheries Research 
Agency will improve this situation. 
 
4.2.2 Stock Recovery Plan and effort regulation 
system 
 
The TAC system described above is largely aimed 
to regulate offshore stocks and fisheries.  Since 
2002, the Fisheries Agency has begun a new 
management approach called the Stock Recovery 
Plan to recover depleted coastal stocks and 
fisheries.  By April 2004, plans have been 
established for recovering 13 depleted species in 
seven regions. 
 
In these plans, fishing effort regulation is a major 
component.  In consultation with scientists and 
administrators, fishers themselves recommend on 
actual regulating measures, such as time and area 
closures, fishing net mesh size, limitations of 
vessel number, and gear type restrictions.  
National and local governments support these 
plans through stock enhancement activities, such 
as establishing new sea grass and algal beds on 
spawning and nursery grounds and releasing 
hatchery produced juveniles.  Environmental 
subsidies include compensation for economic 
losses associated with time and area closures and 
the development and introduction of improved 
gears. 
 
There are already signals of some stock recovery 
for some species.  However, in some cases, 
introduced regulations were not severe enough, 
resulting into insufficient and slow recoveries of 
those stocks.  Most recovery plans target one or 
only a few species in a certain region, and only 
mildly consider other species or ecosystem 
functions.  The time and area closures in the plans 
also only protect target species in a certain season, 
i.e., not all species through the year, as would 
might be the case if effective marine protected 
areas (MPAs) were established. 
 
4.2.3 Stock enhancement by hatchery-produced 
juvenile release 
 
Juvenile release of hatchery-produced individuals 
is a traditional approach to stock enhancement in 
Japan, with Pacific salmon as a typical example. 
This approach has been conducted under the 
initiative of national and local governments. 
  
11 
Target organisms usually are higher-valued 
species including fishes, crustaceans and molluscs.  
With these species, landings from hatchery-
produced released juveniles may substantially 
supplement naturally-produced landings in coastal 
capture fisheries.  Hatchery-originated adults also 
contribute to the population fecundity of the wild 
population in some cases, such as with red sea 
bream (Pagrus major) and scallop (Patinopecten 
yessoensis). 
 
There are some ecological concerns about the 
enhancement approach described above that 
include food web consequences, genetic influence 
on wild populations, and the spread of diseases.  In 
recent years, sufficient numbers of spawning 
adults have been used to maintain the genetic 
diversity of released juveniles.  Stocking 
efficiencies and ecological consequences of this 
approach are being considered with respect to vital 
population parameter rates and predation rates of 
juveniles after their release, and with respect to 
food web structures in release areas prior to 
juvenile releases. 
 
4.3 Conservation and sustainable develop-
ment on coastal waters  
 
In Japan, coastal waters are well exploited as 
fishing and aquaculture grounds.  The total landing 
from coastal fisheries and aquaculture production 
was 2,820,000 t in 2003, almost half of the total 
Japanese marine fisheries landing.  Natural water 
purification by tidal flats and salt marshes is an 
essential ecosystem function required to sustain 
biological production in coastal waters.  However, 
Japanese industries and human populations are 
dense in coastal areas, where about 50% of the 
first sale price of industrial products is generated.  
Since the 1970s, Japan has enacted several laws 
that aim to control environmental land-sourced 
impacts to maintain water quality in the coastal 
environment.  With the increase of human 
activities, however, environmental degradation 
arising from eutrophication, water pollution, and 
lost of tidal flats and salt marshes has been 
recognised as a common problem in Japanese 
coastal waters. 
 
Environmental degradation results in loss of 
habitats for organisms and frequent outbreaks of 
toxic red tides, resulting in a reduction of fishery 
and aquaculture landings.  In addition, some 
coastal fisheries adversely affect coastal 
ecosystems through destruction of bottom faunas 
and floras and the bycatch and discarding of small-
sized target and non-target species in various 
stages of their life cycles.  Aquaculture also has 
adverse effects including contamination of coastal 
environment by fish waste deposition, pesticides, 
and antibiotics; spread of diseases; and 
escapement of non-native cultured species.  
Fishing effort regulations under the Stock 
Recovery Plans described above are attempting to 
remedy the adverse effects of fisheries.  Since 
1999, a new legal subsidy system has been 
developed to help avoid intense aquaculture and to 
reduce the aquacultural use of pesticides and 
antibiotics.  Another legal approach is being 
planned to prohibit or strongly regulate the 
introduction of non-native species.  
 
As mentioned above, there are many conflicts 
between development and conservation in coastal 
zones.  An Integrated Management approach that 
jointly manages coastal waters and lands for 
sustainable development in harmony with 
environmental protection of coastal zones is 
needed.  There have been some attempts to 
evaluate the economic value of goods and services 
from coastal ecosystems, as well as the need to 
restrict and regulate coastal development.  In 
Tokyo Bay, a coastal environmental recovery plan 
has started with the participations of local 
government and citizens.  
 
To address common environmental issues in 
coastal waters of East Asian countries, 
collaborative efforts among relevant countries are 
needed to monitor ecosystem changes, detect 
causal factors, and to coordinate countermeasures.  
PICES may be able to assist in the organisation of 
discussions and actions.  In 2004, Japan held an 
international workshop with China and Korea on 
jellyfish, Stomolophus nomurai, blooms to allow 
the exchange of information and to discuss 
possible future collaboration among these 
countries.

4.4 The implementation of ecosystem-based 
management  
 
In Japanese waters, scientific knowledge on food 
web dynamics is still insufficient to develop and 
apply a quantitative multi-species model for 
fisheries management.  Alteration in dominant 
species occurs among small pelagic fishes with 
decadal ocean climate changes, and these changes 
affect food web structure around Japan.  At 
present, a practical management approach is 
conservative single species management, but 
taking decadal ocean climate changes into 
consideration.  In addition, the following 
approaches should be introduced to the present 
TAC system for incorporating ecosystem 
considerations: (1) a shift of target species with 
species dominance alteration; and (2) a set ceiling 
for the TACs in a region that corresponds to 
biological productivity that varies with decadal 
ocean climate changes.  We also need quantitative 
evaluations of predation mortalities for major 
stocks to assess fishing impacts.  Recent expanded 
research activities to seek mechanistic linkages 
between fish stocks and ambient ecosystems will 
support development of ecosystem-based fisheries 
management system in Japan. 
There have been substantial reductions in number 
of fishing vessels in the Japanese offshore and far 
seas fisheries during the last several decades.  
However, excess fishing capacity and over-fishing 
are still major problems for sustaining marine 
living resources and fisheries, especially in coastal 
waters.  The development of techniques and 
devices for reducing bycatch and discards is 
needed to help reduce the effect of an excess 
fishing capacity and over-fishing.  Studies on the 
establishment of an effective MPA network are 
also necessary.  Examination of the effects of 
economical incentives, such as individual 
transferable quotas (ITQs) and environmental 
subsidies, on stock recovery would be useful for 
developing an integrated management system that 
incorporates socio-economic considerations. 
 
Finally, to harmonize development and 
implementation of an Integrated Management 
plan, agreements are necessary among existing 
government agencies on priorities.  Systematic 
approaches should also be explored to better 
educate the public on these issues and to allow for 
greater citizens’ participation in discussions and 
decision-making.

5. People’s Republic of China 
 
5.1 Overview 
 
The Chinese government has promulgated and put 
into effect fishing closures for motorized trawlers 
in coastal waters, seasonal fishing closures and 
area closures on major fish spawning grounds; and 
has restricted licensing and established minimum 
mesh size regulations since the 1950s.  These have 
had a significant positive effect on the 
conservation of fishery resources.  The 
promulgation and enforcement of the Law of 
Fisheries of the People’s Republic of China was a 
milestone in 1986 in the development of China’s 
conservation of fishery resources.  Since then, 
Chinese fisheries have developed rapidly.  The 
Law of Fisheries defined a fishery development 
policy suitable for China’s situation.  It was a 
significant adjustment of fisheries activities since 
both enforcement capability was strengthened and 
the conservation and rational utilization of fishery 
resources was advanced.  The Law of Fisheries 
was amended in 2000, and quota management was 
established.  The Law of Marine Environment 
Protection was enacted in 2000 and the Law of 
Sea Use Management was enacted in 2002. 
 
Due to the effects of global climate change and 
increasing human activities, inshore fishery 
resources in Chinese coastal waters are now 
mostly fully or over-exploited.  Existing fisheries 
largely depend on small-size, low-value species.  
With the recent rapid development of land-based 
industries and aquaculture along populated coastal 
areas, pollution and habitat degradation are now 
serious problems.  In addition, frequent 
occurrences of harmful algae blooms and 
introductions of non-native species from 
aquaculture and probably, accidentally through 
ballast waters, have adversely affected 
communities in Chinese coastal waters, and 
threaten the health of ecosystems and the 
maintenance of a natural biodiversity.  
 
For the sustainable utilization of marine living 
resources and maintenance of biodiversity, 
ecosystem-based management is needed, and 
sustainable economic development is now a 
management target in Chinese ocean and fisheries 
management policies.  In China, ecosystem-based 
management of marine fisheries is of interest to 
the Ministry of Agriculture (for fisheries), the 
State Oceanic Administration (oceanic affairs 
excluding fisheries), and the State Environmental 
Protection Administration.  There is presently no 
single governmental agency that coordinates the 
implementation of integrated ecosystem-based 
management. 
 
5.2 Current actions 
 
Except for the above-mentioned passive measures, 
the following regulations have been applied in 
order to conserve living resources and restore 
ecosystems.   
 
5.2.1 Output control 
 
Because of high fishing pressures caused by many 
fishermen, single species Total Allowable Catch 
measures are not practical at present.  Instead, 
limiting the total catch is used, with the 1999 
landing as the maximum.  Future total marine 
catches are to be equal or less than the catch in 
1999 (zero growth policy). 
 
5.2.2 Input control 
 
In order to reduce fishing mortality, the Chinese 
government has allocated 270 million CNY each 
year to subsidize the scrapping of older fishing 
boats and to assist fishermen in leaving fishing.  In 
addition, the building of new fishing boats is now 
strictly controlled.  
 
5.2.3 Summer fishing ban 
 
In order to conserve and protect fishery resources, 
China began in 1985 to close all fishing in the 
Yellow, Bohai and East China Seas for 2-3 months 
in the summer.  The scale and duration of these 
closures has been expanded and enlarged over 
time.  In 1999, closures were for 2.5 months in the 
region north of 35ºN, three months south of 35ºN, 
and two months on the continental shelf of the 
South China Sea.  These measures are effectively 
14 
protecting juveniles, allowing catches and quality 
of product to increase and improve.  
 
5.2.4 Enhance ecosystem health 
 
Stock enhancement has been undertaken for more 
than 20 years.  The main species involved are 
high-valued species, particularly penaeid shrimp 
(Penaeus chinensis) in the Bohai, Yellow and East 
China Seas.  Juveniles of other cultured shellfish 
species such as scallop, abalone and jellyfish, are 
released in coastal waters.  Some cultured juvenile 
fishes have also been released, notably red 
seabream (Pagrosomus major), Pseudopleuro-
nectes yokohamae and Liza haematocheila.  I n 
recent years, juvenile large yellow croaker 
(Pseudosciaena crocea) were released in the East 
China Sea to rebuild the depleted stock.  Artificial 
reefs have been established in some coastal areas.  
Established marine protected areas (MPAs) have 
been limited to coastal waters. 
 
Coastal Chinese waters are now mostly fully or 
over-exploited, for both fishing and mariculture.  
High fishing intensity, increasing pollution and 
climate changes have caused both stock depletions 
of some commercially high-valued, large-sized 
species and environmental degradation, with loss 
of habitats and frequent outbreaks of toxic red 
tides.  The adverse effects of mariculture include 
contamination of coastal environment by fish 
wastes, pesticides, and antibiotics; spread of 
diseases; and escapement of non-native species.  
The Chinese government has recognized these 
problems and has promulgated several laws and 
regulations to prevent pollution, both directly and 
from land sources, and is functionally dividing 
coastal areas through zoning to re-arrange areas 
designated for either mariculture or MPAs. 
 
For ecosystem-based management, obtaining a 
better understanding of ecosystems is essential.  
Food web dynamics and species interactions have 
been studied in China’s GLOBEC (Global Ocean 
Ecosystem Dynamics) programmes in the Bohai, 
Yellow and East China Seas.  However, available 
scientific knowledge is still insufficient, especially 
with respect to coastal zones and the effects of 
releasing new species into the ecosystem.  To 
create a functional integrated management system, 
not only fisheries but other impacting factors must 
be considered, and all resource management 
agencies need to participate.

6. Republic of Korea 
 
6.1 Initiatives and actions of ecosystem-based 
management in Korea 
 
Elements of ecosystem-based management (EBM) 
may be (1) sustainability of yields, (2) 
maintenance of biodiversity, (3) protection from 
the effects of pollution and habitat degradation, 
and (4) socio-economic benefits.  Based on these 
elements of EBM, Korean initiatives with the 
spirit of EBM have been established in 14 Acts 
and 15 Presidential and Ministerial Orders.  One 
of the major EBM initiatives in Korea is the Basic 
Act of Ocean and Fisheries Development.  Most of 
the Korean Acts with the spirit of EBM are 
focused on the maintenance of biodiversity and/or 
protection from the effects of pollution and habitat 
degradation, rather than on sustainability of yields 
and achieving socio-economic benefits.  The Basic 
Act of the Land also describes the conservation of 
the natural ecosystem including mountains, rivers, 
lakes, estuaries, and oceans, and the mitigation and 
restoration of the ecosystem, based upon 
comprehensive ecosystem-based management. 
 
6.2 Current ecosystem-based management 
initiatives in Korea  
 
Current initiatives in support of EBM include the 
establishment of (1) precautionary TAC-based 
fishery management, (2) closed fishing 
season/areas, (3) fish size- and sex-controls, (4) 
fishing gear restrictions, and (5) marine protected 
areas (MPA).  The details of these actions follow. 
 
6.2.1 Precautionary TAC-based fishery 
management 
 
Recognition of uncertainty and its potential 
consequences has led to the adoption of a 
precautionary approach (PA) in many international 
agreements on fish stocks.  The PA is focused on 
reducing the likelihood of fisheries having adverse 
impacts on marine resources and the host 
ecosystem.  Since 2000, Korean fisheries law has 
made provisions for the implementation of a total 
allowable catch (TAC)-based fishery management 
system in order to conserve and rationally manage 
fisheries resources in the Korean exclusive 
economic zone (EEZ).  A comprehensive 
monitoring and enforcement program has been 
developed for this management system. 
 
6.2.2 Closed fishing season/areas 
 
Fishing seasons for 24 species during their main 
spawning seasons are closed in Korea.  Fishing 
(trawl, purse seine, gill net, stow nets, and dredged 
net) for 12 offshore species is not allowed in 
coastal areas at any time of the year. 
 
6.2.3 Fish size- and sex-controls 
 
Fish size or weight regulation is applied for 27 
species, based on each species’ 50% spawning 
length or weight.  Females of two crab species 
(tanner crab and snow crab) are not permitted to 
be caught. 
 
6.2.4 Fishing gear design restrictions 
 
Gill nets of more than two layers of nets are 
prohibited in Korean waters.  The sizes of nets and 
meshes are restricted in 19 fisheries.  Gear 
restrictions are set for fishery openings in 18 
fisheries to conserve spawning and juvenile stocks 
and their habitats.  The size of offshore and coastal 
fishing vessels is limited in gross tonnage.  The 
number of licences for five kinds of aquaculture 
farming and set net fisheries are limited by fishing 
gear and area, and the duration of a license is 
limited to 10 years.  Permission to fish is required 
for 13 kinds of offshore fishing gears, 16 kinds of 
coastal fishing gears, 10 kinds of deep-sea fishing 
gears, and two kinds of set nets; and for seed 
production fisheries.  
 
6.2.5 Marine protected areas (MPA) 
 
To ensure opportunity for the propagation and 
conservation of fisheries resources, spawning and 
nursing areas are protected from fishing.  
Currently, a total of 10 areas in bays and estuaries 
(1,289 km
2
 of land, 2,542 km
2
 of shore) and 21 
areas around lakes are regulated by Acts.  To 
conserve biodiversity in wet lands, a total of 5 
areas (83.54 km
2
) along the west coast and 7 areas 
16 
(44.48 km
2
) around mountains, lakes and estuaries 
are designated and managed by Acts, and 9 more 
areas along the coastal line from the west coast to 
the south coast are scheduled to be designated in 
the near future.  
 
The Korean government is currently developing a 
comprehensive ecosystem-based marine ranching 
program.  This program is being planned for the 
enhancement and efficient management of 
fisheries resources, and thus requires an 
understanding of ecological interactions among 
major species with respect to predation, 
competetion for  prey species, effects of climate 
on fish ecology, interactions between fishes and 
their habitats, and the effects of fishing on fish 
stocks and their ecosystems.  With such an 
understanding, fisheries management should 
prevent significant and potentially irreversible 
changes in marine ecosystems caused by fishing.  
The Tongyoung Marine Ranching Program has 
been underway since 1998 as a pilot program for 
comprehensive ecosystem-based management in 
Korea.

7. Russia 
 
7.1 Existing and anticipated ecosystem-based 
management initiatives  
 
Significant expansion of commercial fisheries in 
the Far Eastern region of Russia began in the 
1950s.  Legislation was then needed to regulate 
enhanced fishery activities on living resources.  In 
1962, Regulations for Fishery were developed and 
adopted, where among other things, time and area 
openings for commercial fishing, minimal 
commercial sizes of harvested species, and fishing 
gear type regulations were specified.  However, 
most estimates of allowable catch for commercial 
species were still then devoid of strict quantitative 
assessments of their biomass and abundance.  
Weak enforcement of fishing operations together 
with an absence of data for accurate assessment of 
allowable catch resulted in excessive catches of a 
number of marine animals (some populations of 
flounder, rockfish, king crab, etc.).  At the same 
time, commercial fishing impacts on many 
abundant smaller-sized species (squids, capelin, 
several species of the family Macrouridae) were 
not being considered in commercial fishery 
regulations. 
 
Further development of a rational fishery concept 
resulted in a number of changes being made with 
the Regulations for Fishery, where requirements 
concerning separate species in fishery operations 
were refined and/or changed.  The latest edition of 
these regulations was accepted in 1989.  This was 
an integrated document that regulated harvest of 
fish and non-fish species in the economic zone, 
territorial waters and continental shelf of the 
Russian Federation.  A large amount of data on the 
biology and ecology of commercial species 
collected during the years before 1989 made it 
then possible to provide initial quantitative 
estimates of species abundance, and hence to 
allow estimation of sustainable allowable yields.  
Final appraisal of total allowable catches (TACs) 
is now made by experts from the Ministry for 
Natural Resources of the Russian Federation. 
 
However, such data can indicate only general 
population estimates of major commercial species 
and conditions for their harvest.  To incorporate 
annual and seasonal variability in abundance 
estimates, spatial distributions and life history 
aspects, annual adjustments of dates and locations 
for fishery openings as corrections of TAC are 
now part of the process of determining annual 
fishery regulation.  These adjustments are 
normally based upon survey data and assessments 
of population parameters, but also consider 
information about quantity and quality of catch 
reported directly from fishing vessels.  These 
multiple databases now enable fishery scientists 
from regional research institutes to keep track of 
fishery operations and to provide 
recommendations on the optimal location of 
vessels to maximize their catches, or to 
immediately close a fishery for a particular species 
to address changing circumstances.  Such fishery 
management is now used for walleye pollock, 
turbot, halibut, Pacific salmon, saury and many 
other species. 
 
It is impossible to conduct effective fishery 
management without a solid long-term database of 
individual stock dynamics.  Years of practice have 
shown that when forecasts of marine biological 
resources and their trends are based solely upon 
direct counts of eggs, juveniles, spawners, etc., 
that is, environmental considerations are not 
included, then estimates are frequently incorrect 
for long-term periods.  In order to provide better 
long-term assessments, a variable array of 
ecosystem relationships need to be considered.  To 
accomplish this goal, on-going research into the 
macro-ecosystems of the Far Eastern Seas and 
adjacent Pacific Ocean was commenced in the 
1980s, and these studies continue today.  Annual 
surveys include meteorological, hydrological, 
hydrobiological, trophological, nektonic and 
nektobenthic monitoring, and provide a solid 
background for ecosystem-based management of 
commercial species and populations subjected to 
modern fishing.  Large-scale monitoring on 
species composition and structure of pelagic and 
bottom communities makes it possible to estimate 
ecosystem health, and to produce predictions of 
possible ecosystem changes, including those 
emerging from fishery impacts.  For example, in 
the early 1980s, a general downward productivity 
18 
trend was suggested for the Far Eastern Seas due 
to certain changes in climate and oceanographic 
conditions in the North Pacific.  These 
expectations were later confirmed by a drop in fish 
productivity by more than one third, primarily due 
to a decrease in abundance of pollock and sardine, 
both major commercial species.  Investigations 
suggested that in most cases, variability in natural 
factors such as climate, oceanography and 
resulting trophic level relationships (competition, 
predation), rather than anthropogenic factors, was 
the main reason for the observed dynamics in 
marine communities.  At the same time, 
anthropogenic influence, mostly illegal fishery 
(poaching), led to decreases in abundance of a few 
species, e.g., several populations of crabs, trepang, 
scallop, rockfishes, and several southern 
populations of salmonids. 
 
Overall, fishery landings remained strong.  
Increases in the commercial harvests of herring, 
squids, some salmon populations, Japanese 
anchovy, atka mackerels and several non-
commercial species made up for decreases in 
abundance of other major commercial species, 
such as pollock and sardine.  
 
During such a course of events, and in order to 
maintain stable commercial harvests with an 
objective to even increasing landings when 
possible, it seems appropriate to be able to shift 
fishing effort within a multi-species fishery.  A 
multi-species approach towards fisheries should 
favor expanding the number of harvestable species 
and possibly stabilize overall catch, while 
redistribution of fishery impacts on as many 
species as possible should provide optimal 
utilization of aquatic renewable resources. 
 
Such changes in a fishery strategy need regular, 
rapid updating, and this approach is being 
advocated for the whole structure of commercial 
fisheries in Russia.  This and related items were 
discussed at the “Far-Eastern Fishery Forum” held 
in Vladivostok, in July 2004. 
 
7.2 Issues related to the implementation of 
ecosystem-based management 
 
A major fundamental research study that will 
provide a solid basis for fishery regulation is 
ecosystem-based management of resources that 
includes assessment of the carrying capacity of 
marine ecosystems.  Thorough investigation of 
factors that may limit species abundance is 
necessary.  It seems productive to continue regular 
large-scale surveys of communities within 
ecosystems using modern equipment and 
techniques.  The large amount of knowledge 
obtained by Russian scientists suggests that 
research on the following is still needed: 
 
null production and population biology; 
null trophologic investigations; 
null studies on the dynamics of abundance of 
commercial species. 
 
Such studies can provide the necessary parameters 
for ecosystem modeling and for enhancement of 
rational fisheries, particularly multi-species 
fishing.  Ecosystem studies should significantly 
contribute to applied goals such as determining the 
optimal scale and interaction of fishery, 
aquaculture and natural area protection.  Whether 
ecosystem-based fishery regulation is ultimately 
effective will largely depend upon the 
development of new, or well-known but modified, 
methods of fishery management, and upon the 
development of new technology for the capture of 
marine organisms.

8. United States of America 
 
Recent, worldwide calls for an ecosystem-based 
approach to fisheries management imply that the 
necessary framework for protecting ecosystem 
components and structure and function has been 
lacking in present-day fishery management 
systems.  These global interests are echoed in the 
report of the official U.S. Commission on Ocean 
Policy (2004) and a private report issued by the 
Pew Ocean Commission (2003).  The U.S. 
Commission on Ocean Policy recommends, “to 
refine the existing fishery management system to 
strengthen the use of science and move toward a 
more ecosystem-based management approach.”  
Emphasis on ecosystem and multi-species 
management approaches is predicted to improve 
sustainable yields of harvested stocks while 
maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function. 
 
8.1 Definitions and approaches to ecosystem-
based fishery management in the United 
States 
 
An ecosystem is a geographically specified system 
of organisms (including humans), the 
environment, and the processes that control its 
dynamics.  The environment comprises the 
biological, chemical, physical, and social 
conditions that surround organisms.  Therefore, 
when appropriate, the term environment should be 
qualified as biological, chemical, physical, and/or 
social.  These environments are dynamic over 
various temporal scales. 
 
Ecosystem-based management attempts to 
administer policies for natural resource 
exploitation that consider these various 
environments.  Traditional resource management 
generally focuses on single species in isolation.  
By putting organisms in an ecosystem context, we 
may better anticipate changes in abundance or 
distribution of species as they respond to 
exploitation and changes in their environments.  
Primary management issues addressed in an 
ecosystem approach to fishery management are:  
(1) bycatch or fishery interactions, including 
mortalities of non-target and protected species, (2) 
consideration of the indirect effects of harvesting 
(food web interactions and habitat alteration), and 
(3) interactions between biological and physical 
components of ecosystems (environmental 
variation and human effects such as energy 
development activities, toxics, runoff, etc.). 
 
An ecosystem approach to management of marine 
fisheries in the U.S. needs to:  (1) be adaptive, (2) 
be regionally directed, (3) take account of 
ecosystem knowledge, (4) take account of 
uncertainty, (5) consider multiple external 
influences and (6) strive to balance diverse 
societal objectives.  Transition to an ecosystem-
based approach needs to be incremental and 
collaborative.  In addition, it is imperative that 
there is accurate catch and bycatch accounting as 
well as consideration of such measures as 
dedicated access privileges (share-based 
management programs, etc.) to assist in providing 
greater incentives to the fishing entities to promote 
the conservation of the marine resources on which 
they depend (i.e., decreasing the tendency to “race 
for fish”).  
 
8.2 Present U.S. legislative mandates relating 
to ecosystem-based fishery management 
 
Several U.S. laws presently provide protection to 
marine ecosystems and these laws have been in 
existence for over 20 years (Table 8.1). 
 
8.2.1 Target species 
 
Management of target fish species in federal 
marine waters in the U.S. is governed primarily by 
the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (MSFCMA), originally passed in 
1976 and amended in 1996 by the Sustainable 
Fisheries Act (http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/ 
magact/index.html).  National standard guidelines 
(http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/refm/stocks/nsgfinal.pd
f) for implementing the requirements of the 
MSFCMA have been developed to guide regions 
in development, review and amendment of fishery 
management plans and regulations prepared by 
Regional Fishery Management Councils and the 
Secretary of Commerce under the Act.  These 
guidelines specify that maximum sustainable yield 
determinations consider the amount of yield that 
20 
can be taken from a stock or stock complex under 
the prevailing ecological and environmental 
conditions. 
 
8.2.2 Bycatch species 
 
With respect to protection of bycatch species, 
National Standard 9 was added to the Magnuson –
Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act when it was amended in 1996.  It states that 
“Conservation and management measures shall, to 
the extent practicable, (A) minimize bycatch and 
(B) to the extent bycatch cannot be avoided, 
minimize the mortality of such bycatch”.  The 
national bycatch website is http://www.nmfs. 
noaa.gov/bycatch.htm.  At the national level, a 
plan for dealing with bycatch has been developed.  
This plan is available at http://www.nmfs. 
noaa.gov/bycatchplanonline.pdf.  A national 
strategy for dealing with bycatch was also recently 
developed and can be found at http://www.nmfs. 
noaa.gov/bycatch_images/FINALstrategy.pdf. 
 
8.2.3 Threatened or endangered species 
 
Other legislation that impacts fishery management 
is the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) 
(http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/prot_res/laws/MMPA/
MMPA.html) and Endangered Species Act (ESA) 
(http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/prot_res/laws/ESA/ES
A_Home.html).  The MMPA establishes a federal

responsibility to conserve marine mammals, with a 
goal of obtaining an optimum sustainable 
population of marine mammals within the carrying 
capacity of the habitat.  This law also specifies a 
goal that the level of incidental mortality and 
serious injury of marine mammals be reduced to 
insignificant levels approaching a zero rate, which 
is commonly referred to as the Zero Mortality Rate 
Goal (ZMRG).  If a fishery affects a marine 
mammal population, then the potential impacts of 
the fishery must be analyzed in an environmental 
assessment or environmental impact statement 
required by NEPA.  The ESA provides protection 
for fish and wildlife species that are listed as 
threatened or endangered. 
 
The MMPA defined Potential Biological Removal 
(PBR) rates to be used to set allowable takes of 
marine mammals in fisheries.  These rates are the 
product of the minimum population estimate, one-
half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, 
and a recovery factor.  These PBRs define a 
maximum level of take that would still allow the 
species to attain its optimum sustainable 
population.  This management approach was 
instituted with the understanding that direct 
human-related mortalities would be the primary 
reason for observed declines, which may not be 
the case for some species.  Fisheries report direct 
takes of animals.  If PBRs are exceeded or the 
marine mammal stock is threatened or endangered 
(or has some potential for being listed in the near 
future), a take reduction team is formed to develop 
a plan that will reduce the take within 6 months of 
its implementation to levels less than the PBR and 
over the span of 5 years to reduce the levels in 
commercial fishery operations to levels 
approaching zero.  See the following web site for 
more information on this management approach:  
http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/prot_res/PR2/Fisheries
_Interactions/TRT.htm.   
 
Another management process for reducing 
interactions between fisheries and threatened or 
endangered species is the Section 7 consultation 
under the ESA.  First, informal consultation takes 
place in which the agency contemplating an action  
(such as fishing) must contact either the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service or U.S. National Marine 
Fisheries Service Protected Resources to get a list 
of endangered or threatened species and habitats in 
the action region.  If the action agency determines 
(and the protection resource agency agrees) that 
the project may adversely affect the species, then a 
formal consultation is required.  The protection 
agency then determines if the action will 
jeopardize the continued existence of the species 
or adversely modify its habitat.  If either of these 
is judged to be occurring, then the Biological 
Opinion must identify reasonable and prudent 
alternatives that would remove jeopardy and 
adverse habitat alterations, and allow the action to 
go forward.  For more complete description of the 
consultation process, see http://endangered.fws. 
gov/consultations/consultations.pdf.  Jeopardize 
the continued existence is defined as “engage in an 
action that reasonably would be expected, directly 
or indirectly, to reduce appreciably the likelihood 
of both the survival and recovery of a listed 
species in the wild by reducing the reproduction, 
numbers or distribution of that species”.  
Destruction or adverse modification of habitat 
means a direct or indirect alteration that 
appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat 
for both the survival and recovery of a listed 
species.  Such alterations include, but are not 
limited to, alterations adversely modifying any of 
those physical or biological features that were the 
basis for determining the habitat to be critical.  
These definitions lack clearly articulated 
quantitative standards for decision-making. 
 
8.2.4 Habitats 
 
At the federal level, the Magnuson-Stevens 
Fishery Conservation and Management Act calls 
for direct action to stop or reverse the continued 
loss and degradation of fish habitats.  Congress 
mandated the identification of habitats essential to 
all life history stages of managed species and 
measures to conserve and enhance this habitat.  
The Act requires cooperation among NOAA 
Fisheries (NMFS), the regional Fishery 
Management Councils, fishing participants, and 
Federal and State agencies to protect, conserve, 
and enhance essential fish habitat (EFH).  The 
amended Magnuson-Stevens Act requires NMFS 
to minimize damage to EFH from fishing 
practices, to the extent practicable. 
 
Additionally, the Act requires Federal agencies 
that authorize, fund, or conduct activities that 
22 
“may adversely affect” EFH to work with NMFS 
to develop measures that minimize damage to 
EFH.  Federal agencies proposing to dredge or fill 
habitats in or near EFH, for instance, must consult 
with NMFS to develop EFH conservation 
measures if the action may adversely affect EFH.  
While NMFS does not have veto authority over 
federal projects adversely affecting EFH, this 
mandate enables NMFS to provide guidance to 
Federal action agencies on ways to tailor their 
projects to minimize harm to EFH.  By requiring 
the consideration of impacts on EFH from both 
fishing and non-fishing activities, the Magnuson-
Stevens Act ensures that NMFS takes a more 
holistic approach to fish habitat protection.  Laws 
and regulations on EFH can be found at 
http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/habitat/habitatprotectio
n/essentialfishhabitat6.htm. 
 
Aside from the consultation requirements above, 
NMFS is presently working on the designation of 
EFH and development of protection measures for 
each of the fishery management regions in the 
U.S.  NMFS and five regional Fishery 
Management Councils are preparing new 
environmental impact statements (EISs) for the 
EFH components of many fishery management 
plans.  In response to a court order, NMFS will 
prepare EISs to evaluate the designation of EFH, 
the identification of Habitat Areas of Particular 
Concern (HAPCs), and the minimization of the 
adverse effects of fishing on EFH.  In the 
meantime, NMFS is actively researching gear 
effects on habitat.   
 
8.2.5 Food webs 
 
The general approach to management of food 
webs in general and of direct feeding interactions 
(predator-prey relationships involving the target 
species) specifically has several facets.  First, the 
Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act defines optimum yield as “the 
amount of fish that will provide the greatest 
overall benefit to the Nation, particularly with 
respect to food production and recreational 
opportunities and taking into account the 
protection of marine ecosystems”.  The amount is 
prescribed on the basis of the MSY from the 
fishery, as reduced by any relevant economic, 
social, or ecological factor.  Examples of 
ecological factors are given in the National 
Standard guidelines and include predator-prey or 
competitive interactions, and dependence of 
marine mammals and birds or endangered species 
on a stock of fish.  Thus, fishery managers are 
given direction to modify maximum biological 
yield targets to account for ecological factors such 
as predator/prey relationships.   
 
Scientific information provided to U.S. Fishery 
Management Councils includes the SAFE reports 
(Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation), 
which, according to national standards, should 
contain the most recent biological condition of the 
stocks and the marine ecosystems in the fishery 
management unit.  It summarizes, on a periodic 
basis, the best available scientific information 
concerning the past, present, and possible future 
condition of the stocks, marine ecosystems, and 
fisheries being managed. 
 
8.2.6 Ecosystems 
 
An even broader piece of legislation, the National 
Environmental Policy Act (http://ceq.eh.doe.gov/ 
nepa/regs/nepa/nepaeqia.htm), governs the actions 
of federal fisheries managers by requiring public 
officials to make decisions that are based on an 
understanding of environmental consequences, 
and take actions that protect, restore, and enhance 
the environment.   
 
8.3 Integration of legislative mandates into an 
ecosystem approach 
 
Historically, marine research and management 
under each of these laws has tended to be fairly 
separate.  Although marine fishery managers 
attempted to meet the requirements of the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the production 
of environmental assessments and impact 
statements under this law were viewed more as an 
administrative task than as a useful tool for 
scientific evaluation and mitigation of ecosystem 
impacts of fishing. 
 
A key characteristic of recent environmental 
assessments relating to fisheries is the involvement 
of a broad range of scientific expertise and the use 
of NEPA requirements to guide the analysis.  
Instead of being viewed solely as an 
23 
administrative burden, the original spirit and intent 
of NEPA to provide an open, public process to 
advise decision-makers on alternatives for the 
protection of the environment is now the essential 
framework for implementing ecosystem-based 
fisheries management.  Originators of NEPA 
recommended that implementation be integrated 
with other planning and environmental review 
procedures so that all such procedures run 
concurrently.  Thus, this law also provides the 
means for integrating the disparate requirements 
and reviews required by other U.S. laws governing 
specific aspects of the marine environment into a 
common, overarching ecosystem-based assess-
ment framework. 
 
Historically, NEPA assessments have been 
constrained mainly to analysis of specific 
management decisions at the federal fisheries level 
that are likely to have a significant effect on the 
environment.  Thus, there has been a tendency to 
focus on the particular decision to be made and its 
likely effects, e.g., setting of the total allowable 
catch or a change in a management measure.  
More recently, these NEPA assessments have been 
done at a broader policy level, examining the 
whole suite of fishery management measures and 
policy goals in a region, which provide a 
framework for implementing ecosystem-based 
improvements to the region’s fishery management. 
 
Currently, the U.S. Congress is considering 
legislation for revamping U.S. fisheries law that 
calls for: 
 
null each of the regional Fishery Management 
Councils to prepare a report outlining a 
prioritized list of information and research 
needs to support ecosystem-based 
management of the fisheries within its 
jurisdiction; 
null these efforts to be supported by the Secretary 
of Commerce with additional resources; 
null for a process to select a pilot program for 
ecosystem-based management in one region;  
null for concerted efforts to perform research 
needed to develop the information required;   
null for a Fishery Ecosystem Plan to be submitted 
for approval by the Secretary of Commerce.  
[Senate Bill 2066, 108
th
 Congress, 2
nd
 Session;  
http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/C?c109:/ 
temp/~c1086cPgVx] 
 
These provisions follow on the recommendations 
to Congress made by the Ecosystem Principles 
Advisory Committee in its 1999 Report to 
Congress (NMFS EPAP, 1999) that Fishery 
Ecosystem Plans form the basis for advancing 
ecosystem-based management in U.S. regional 
fisheries.  In addition they incorporate the 
experience with the development of a 
demonstration Fishery Ecosystem Plan for 
Chesapeake Bay [Chesapeake Fisheries Ecosystem 
Plan Technical Advisory Panel. 2004. Fisheries 
Ecosystem Planning for Chesapeake Bay. NOAA 
Chesapeake Bay Office, Baltimore, MD.]. 
 
Details of the present state of implementing 
ecosystem-based fishery management in the U.S. 
North Pacific regions of Alaska and West Coast of 
North America are contained in Appendices 10.3 
and 10.4, respectively. 
 
8.4 Scientific issues in implementing 
ecosystem-based approaches 
 
There are a number of scientific challenges ahead 
with respect to implementing ecosystem-based 
fishery management in the United States.  These 
include the need to: 
 
null Improve predictive capability with regard to 
climate and human impacts on ecosystems: 
model refinement and regime shift analysis to 
drive recruitment scenarios; 
null Develop a more explicit definition of 
ecosystem-based management objectives: may 
require public involvement in defining specific 
regional objectives for management; 
null Develop objective criteria and sensitive 
indicators to measure the success in achieving 
desired ecosystem state or condition (or 
avoidance of undesirable states); 
null Develop a more formalized decision-making 
framework, including standardized tools for 
objective analysis.  
 
In particular, an important aspect of implementing 
an information-rich, ecosystem-based approach to 
fishery management is the development and 
validation of predictive models that include 
24 
climate, predator-prey interactions, and habitat and 
which consider the effects of fishing on the 
ecosystem.  A description and listing of some of 
the models that have been developed or are under 
development in the U.S. North Pacific region that 
might be used to predict effects of fishing on 
ecosystems are contained in Appendix 10.5.

9. Discussion and recommendations 
 
In considering the summaries of each country’s 
approach to EBM, it is immediately obvious that 
challenges were different between China, Japan 
and Korea vs. Russia, Canada and the United 
States.  The greater coastal populations in the 
former three countries, coupled with their much 
longer history of full exploitation of most 
harvestable renewable resources, meant that EBM 
is, initially at least, focused on 1) minimising 
existing impacts, 2) rebuilding depleted stocks to 
more acceptable levels, and 3) in near-shore areas 
in particular, minimising widespread impacts in 
the marine environment from land runoff from 
both industrial and urban developments.  In 
contrast, in the latter three countries, human 
coastal populations and developments were 
generally much less, with fishing impacts and 
offshore oil and gas development and transport 
identified as the major impacts.  In many 
instances, relatively unimpacted, pristine habitat 
and biological communities still existed, and so 
the challenges there were often how to maintain 
them while permitting appropriate new economic 
activity to occur. 
 
Many human activities are documented as 
affecting the marine environment (e.g., fishing, 
mariculture, oil and gas exploration and 
development, pollution from land-based activities, 
disruption of freshwater discharges by 
urbanisation, etc.), but the most comprehensive 
databases (e.g., target species landings, bycatch 
and discard characteristics, habitat disruption, etc.) 
as to how these impacts are affecting marine 
ecosystems are related to fishing activities.  
Hence, much initial reporting of ecosystem 
impacts has been focused on documenting and 
addressing fishery impacts.  A standardised PICES 
reporting framework that describes human activity 
impacts is needed for comparative purposes. 
Ideally, this format should be robust enough to 
address the increasing number of environmental 
and other requirements imposed by legislation, 
certification schemes, and consumer and 
community demands.  It should also capture 
ecosystem effects resulting from most human 
activities, and describe how these ecosystem 
effects are being monitored.  Ecosystem 
parameters already, or potentially, being 
monitored may be capturing environmental 
change, without linking this change back to the 
specific human activity, or activities, that in fact 
might be causing the change (e.g., increasing sea 
water temperature may be the result of many 
causes, some of which relate to human activities).  
In some cases, additional research may need to be 
undertaken to determine these linkages. 
 
The Study Group recommended: 
 
1. The establishment of a Working Group on 
Ecosystem-based management and its 
application to the North Pacific (WGEBM) 
under the direction of the Fishery Science 
(FIS) and Marine Environmental Quality 
(MEQ) Committees with a 3-year duration 
and the following terms of reference: 
 
Terms of reference with additional information: 
 
1. Describe and implement a standard reporting 
format for EBM initiatives (including more 
than fishery management) in each PICES 
country, plus a listing of the ecosystem-based 
management objectives of each country. 
 
Review and describe in detail existing and 
anticipated ecosystem-based management 
objectives and initiatives in PICES member 
countries and elsewhere globally, and the 
scientific bases for them (this will be in more 
detail than is summarized in this report of the 
Study Group).  Common elements, gaps and 
critical issues will be identified, particularly for 
areas such as monitoring, in which concerted 
international (e.g., PICES) efforts might help in 
the achievement of progress.  A standard reporting 
format, such as the attached Australian outline 
(Appendix 10.6), would be developed for 
summarising the approach each country has 
adopted for all human impacts affecting the 
marine environment, including fishing. 
 
2. Describe relevant national marine ecosystem 
monitoring approaches and plans and types of 
models for predicting human and 
26 
environmental influences on ecosystems.  
Identify key information gaps and research 
and implementation challenges. 
 
The most important emerging scientific issues 
related to EBM appear to be the identification of 
sensitive ecosystem indicators and development of 
predictive models that can tell managers how 
ecosystem state might change in response to 
human or climate forcing.  A major challenge in 
the achievement of EBM is determining what are 
the most relevant and cost-effective ecosystem 
parameters to measure in the monitoring of 
whether EBM is actually being effectively 
achieved.  The details of such parameters can be 
expected to be ecosystem-specific, but evaluation 
is required of whether there are underlying basic 
parameters that need to be monitored in all 
systems.  Within PICES member countries, efforts 
would be described that explore science evaluation 
of potential components of ecosystem monitoring 
(measurements, indicators).  Another key aspect of 
EBM to be examined would be national efforts to 
develop predictive models that incorporate human 
and climate effects and important ecosystem 
processes (such as predator-prey dynamics).  The 
Working Group could then comment on key gaps 
in the ecosystem monitoring system of the North 
Pacific and recommend development of additional 
models for decision-making. 
 
3. Evaluate the indicators from the 2004 
Symposium on “Quantitative Ecosystem 
Indicators for Fisheries Management” for 
usefulness and application to the North 
Pacific.  
 
4. Review existing definitions of “eco-regions” 
and identify criteria that could be used for 
defining ecological boundaries relevant to 
PICES. 
 
The FAO Technical Guidelines for Responsible 
Fisheries recognise that for ecosystems to be a 
functional management unit, they need to be 
geographically-based with ecologically 
meaningful boundaries.  Eco-regions are defined 
by jurisdictions differently, but are used here with 
Canada’s definition:  “a part of a larger marine 
area (eco-province) characterized by continental 
shelf-scale regions that reflect regional variations 
in salinity, marine flora and fauna, and 
productivity.”  Such ecosystem features often 
cross national boundaries.  The product envisaged 
here is the listing of criteria for identifying 
ecological boundaries.  Ecologically relevant 
boundaries are needed to allow scientific 
evaluation of how EBM objective achievement 
can be assessed, and to determine what potential 
components in an ecosystem monitoring and 
prediction program are most appropriate for the 
ecosystem being considered.  It is important to 
have a standardised set of terms and vocabulary 
for defining spatial scales of interest. 
 
5. Hold an inter-sessional workshop in Year 2 or 
3 of the WG’s mandate that addresses the 
status and progress of EBM science efforts in 
the PICES region, with the deliverable being 
either a special journal issue or a review 
article. 
 
6. Recommend to PICES further issues and 
activities that address the achievement of 
EBM in the Pacific.

2. The convening of a joint FIS/MEQ Topic 
Session at the PICES Fourteenth Annual 
Meeting (October 2005, Vladivostok, 
Russia) on “Ecosystem indicators and 
models”. 
 
Draft description of proposed Topic Session: 
Ecosystem-based management (EBM) of 
resources will require ways to monitor current 
conditions and predict future states.  Ecosystem 
indicators are single variables that reflect the 
status of broad suites of management activities or 
environmental conditions, and their assessment is 
key to monitoring the achievement of EBM.  
Predictive ecosystem models can be used to 
hypothesize the responses of an ecosystem to 
management actions, to assess the sensitivities of 
indicators, and to highlight gaps in current 
knowledge.  This session will bring experts 
together to identify criteria for suitable indicators 
and the utilities of predictive models, and to 
present candidates of indicators and models that 
are actively in use in PICES areas.

Appendix 10.2 Terminology definitions 
 
The ecosystem literature is rich with definitions 
and terms.  The Canadian National Workshop on 
“Objectives and indicators for ecosystem-based 
management” (Feb. 27 – Mar. 2, 2001, Sidney, 
B.C. Canada) spent considerable time discussing 
and debating those related to the ecosystem-level 
objectives (Jamieson et al., 2001; see section 3.4).  
The terms and definitions given in the table below 
are based upon those currently in use in the 
literature as well as a few new ones added at the 
workshop. 
 
 
Term Definition 
Characteristic Some property of the ecosystem, separate from our measurement of it (e.g., 
absolute biomass or recruitment measures for a population) 
Ecosystem The spatial unit and its organisms and natural processes (and cycles) that is being 
studied or managed 
Ecosystem-based 
management 
A strategic approach to managing human activities that seeks to ensure through 
collaborative stewardship the coexistence of healthy, fully functioning 
ecosystems and human communities [towards maintaining long-term system 
sustainability] by integrating ecological, economic, social, institutional and 
technological considerations 
Indicator 
(attribute) 
Quantity that can be measured and be used to track changes over time with 
respect to an operational objective.  Measurable part or process (property) of a 
system (e.g., average weight of age 5 individuals of a species) 
Metric Indicator empirically shown to change in value along a gradient of human 
influence (e.g., a population’s biomass as a result of fishing activity; number of 
introduced (exotic) feral species) 
Multimetric index A number that integrates several metrics to indicate a “condition” factor 
Reference point Value of an indicator corresponding to a management target or threshold  
Target reference 
point 
An indicator reference point that is trying to be achieved (e.g., an estimated 
biomass of 30,000 t) 
Limit reference 
point 
An indicator reference point that if crossed results in the implementation of a 
management action (e.g., if the estimated biomass falls below 10,000 t, the 
fishery is closed) 
Conceptual 
objective  
General statements that are uniformly accepted by all stakeholders as desirable.  
They are specific enough that everyone will interpret them the same way, but do 
not specify how they will be measured. 
Operational 
objective  
Objective that has a direct and practical interpretation in the context of (fisheries, 
habitat) management and against which performance can be evaluated 
quantitatively.  A specific statement that consists of a verb (e.g., maintain), a 
specific measurable indicator (e.g., estimated biomass), and a reference point 
(e.g., 50,000 t), thus allowing an action statement for management (e.g., maintain 
estimated biomass of a given forage species greater than 20,000 t biomass).

Appendix 10.3 Present state of implementing ecosystem-based fishery 
management in Alaska:  Alaska groundfish fisheries 
 
10.3.1 Regulatory legislation, documents, and 
actions 
 
Federally-managed Alaska groundfish fisheries 
occur in the U.S. EEZ primarily on the shelf and 
slope areas of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and 
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI).  These 
fisheries are managed under two fishery 
management plans (FMPs):  the Bering 
Sea/Aleutian Islands Groundfish FMP (http:// 
www.fakr.noaa.gov/npfmc/fmp/bsai/bsai.htm) and 
the GOA Groundfish FMP (http://www.fakr. 
noaa.gov/npfmc/fmp/goa/goa.htm).  
 
Acceptable biological catch (ABC) and total 
allowable catch (TAC) levels are prescribed for a 
number of species in the BSAI and GOA 
management regions, although some may not 
necessarily be a target species of groundfish 
fisheries.  The final specifications for the 2003 
fisheries on these species, which include 
information on the biomass, ABC, overfishing 
levels, TAC levels, and the past year actual catch 
amounts can be found at http://www.fakr. 
noaa.gov/npfmc/CouncilBSAIFinal03.pdf and 
http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/npfmc/GOAABC03Cou
ncilFinal.pdf. 
 
The following species/groups are actively 
managed in the BSAI region:  walleye pollock, 
Pacific cod, yellowfin sole, Greenland turbot, 
arrowtooth flounder, rock sole, flathead sole, 
Alaska plaice, “other flatfish” (mostly starry 
flounder, rex sole and butter sole), sablefish, 
Pacific ocean perch, northern rockfish, shortraker 
and rougheye rockfish, other rockfish (two 
predominant species: light dusky rockfish and 
shortspine thornyheads), Atka mackerel, squid, 
and an “other species” group (includes sculpins, 
skates, sharks, and octopus). 
 
Catch limits are prescribed for the following 
species/groups in the GOA:  walleye pollock, 
Pacific cod, deep-water flatfish (Dover sole, 
Greenland turbot, and deep-sea sole), rex sole, 
shallow-water flatfish (northern rock sole, 
southern rock sole, yellowfin sole, starry flounder, 
butter sole, English sole, Alaska plaice, and sand 
sole), flathead sole, arrowtooth flounder, sablefish, 
other slope rockfish (sharpchin, redstripe, 
harlequin, silvergrey, yellowmouth, and redbanded 
rockfish are the dominant species), northern 
rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, shortraker/rougheye 
rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish (predominantly 
light dusky rockfish), demersal shelf rockfish 
(predominantly yelloweye rockfish), Atka 
mackerel, thornyhead rockfish, and an “other 
species” group (includes sculpins, skates, sharks, 
squid, and octopus). 
 
The North Pacific Fishery Management Council 
has developed several programs to address over-
capacity in the Alaskan fisheries.  For most 
groundfish, management programs limit the 
number of harvesting vessels that may be 
deployed off Alaska.  The License Limitation 
Program for groundfish and crab vessels was 
implemented on January 1, 2000, and replaced the 
moratorium placed on new vessel entry into 
federal groundfish fisheries in Alaska 
implemented in 1996.  Halibut and fixed gear 
sablefish fisheries are managed under an 
Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) program, which, 
rather than limiting harvesting vessels, grants 
Quota Share holders the privilege of harvesting a 
specified percentage of the Total Allowable Catch 
(TAC) each year.  There also exists a Community 
Development Quota (CDQ) program that allocates 
a percentage of all BSAI groundfish quotas to 
eligible communities.  The purpose of the program 
is to provide the means for starting or supporting 
commercial fisheries business activities that will 
result in an ongoing, regionally-based, fisheries-
related economic activity in coastal Native 
communities of western Alaska. 
 
Congress, too, has provided statutory tools to help 
relieve over-capitalization.  The American 
Fisheries Act (AFA) retires and limits harvesting 
vessels, authorizes harvesting cooperatives to 
which a portion of the total allowable catch of 
BSAI pollock is granted, prevents pollock fishery 
participants from expanding historical activities to 
38 
other fisheries, and stabilizes deliveries to 
shoreside processors. 
 
The other groundfish fisheries not managed by 
IFQ or cooperative, are managed primarily 
through TACs and a variety of vessel/gear 
restrictions specific to each fishery.  For example, 
Pacific cod TACs are allocated to fixed 
proportions of certain gear types (pot, longline, 
trawl).  Bottom trawls are banned for the BSAI 
walleye pollock fishery. 
 
Another essential aspect of the management 
program is the large Observer Program.  Data 
provided by the Observer Program are critical 
elements in the conservation and management of 
groundfish, other living marine resources, and 
their habitat.  For example, these data are used for:  
(1) assessing the status of groundfish stocks;  
(2) setting groundfish quotas and monitoring them 
in season;  (3) monitoring the bycatch of non-
groundfish species in season;  (4) assessing the 
effects of the groundfish fishery on other living 
marine resources and their habitat;  and 
(5) assessing methods for improving the 
conservation and management of groundfish, other 
living marine resources and their habitat.  The 
Observer Program also provides the industry with 
bycatch data it needs to make timely fishing 
decisions that decrease bycatch and increase 
productivity. 
 
10.3.2 Retained species 
 
The general approach to retained species 
management is the annual TAC-setting process 
and an at-sea observer program to monitor TAC.  
Stocks or stock complexes within the retained (or 
target) species category are part of this process.  
TACs are set by the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council and are less than or equal to 
the ABCs set by stock assessment scientists, which 
are in turn less than defined overfishing levels 
(OFL).  The following document summarizes the 
tier system for setting groundfish ABCs and also 
includes life history parameters for the managed 
stocks in the BSAI region:  http://www.fakr. 
noaa.gov/npfmc/Reports/bsstock.htm.  Federal 
fishery scientists are, in general, responsible for 
deriving ABC and OFL estimates that are then 
reviewed by a panel of federal, state, and 
independent scientists that are on the Groundfish 
Plan Teams of the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council.  These ABCs and OFLs are 
then presented to the Council’s Science and 
Statistical Committee for review.  The SSC then 
makes the ABC and OFL recommendations to the 
North Pacific Fishery Management Council.  
 
In general, pollock and cod are dominant target 
species in the BSAI and are fairly productive on 
the r-K spectrum.  Pollock is a mid-trophic level 
species that is also a key prey of many groundfish, 
birds, and marine mammals in the region.  Atka 
mackerel, the dominant target in the Aleutian 
Islands, is also a relatively productive, primarily 
planktivorous species that is also preyed upon by 
groundfish and marine mammals in that region.  
Cod have a very diverse diet, consisting of a broad 
mixture of benthic invertebrates including 
commercially important crab, and also fish such as 
walleye pollock and flatfish.  Other species such 
as rockfish are very long-lived, viviparous, 
primarily planktivorous species.  Flatfish species 
are somewhat intermediate in the r-K spectrum, 
tending to be longer-lived than pollock and cod.  
Some flatfish such as yellowfin sole and rock sole 
feed on benthic infauna while other flatfish such as 
Greenland turbot and arrowtooth flounder are very 
piscivorous. 
 
Recruitment variability of some of these species is 
summarized by Hollowed et al. (2001).  Flatfish 
species such as Greenland turbot, arrowtooth 
flounder, rock sole, and yellowfin sole, tend to 
have recruitment time series that have high 
autocorrelation with strong decadal-scale patterns 
while the gadids (pollock and cod) tend to have 
large inter-annual variability in recruitment. 
 
Control rules, recovery rules and targets are 
contained in a more detailed description on pages 
2.7-71 through 2.7-93 of the January 2001 Draft 
Programmatic Supplemental Environmental 
Impact Statement on Alaska Groundfish Fisheries 
(http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/sustainablefisheries/sei
s/intro.htm).  In general, OFL is a limit reference 
point and ABC is used as a target reference point.  
A minimum stock size threshold (MSST) is also 
defined.  If a stock falls below this level it is 
considered overfished (although a stock could fall 
below the threshold without being fished) and a 
39 
rebuilding plan is developed.  ABCs are derived 
for various stocks using a tier system that 
establishes maximum allowable fishing rates 
depending on the amount of information available 
for the stock.  The tier system is configured such 
that max ABC is always less than OFL except at 
very low stock sizes (where both maxABC and 
OFL are zero).  The FMPs require that ABC be set 
between zero and maxABC.  One of the central 
features of Tiers 1-3 is that Fofl and MaxFabc 
decreases linearly with biomass whenever biomass 
falls below a tier-specific reference level.  Most 
individual stocks are currently managed under Tier 
3, where max Fabc equals F40% if biomass is 
above B40%.  In Tier 1 (but not in any other tier), 
greater statistical uncertainty automatically results 
in a lower max ABC.  This adjustment implies a 
fixed level of risk aversion and is computed using 
the statistical uncertainty surrounding both the 
estimate of the projected stock size and the 
estimate of Fmsy.  In the 2002 harvest season for 
the BSAI, only one stock (walleye pollock) was in 
Tier 1, ten were in Tier 3, eight were Tier 5, and 
two were in Tier 6 of our tier system.  Our Tier 6 
appears to correspond to Tier 5 in Appendix 2 of 
the Australian Best Practice Reference Points.  At 
present, there are no Alaskan groundfish stocks 
that are considered overfished although we are 
unable to determine this for stocks that are below 
our Tier 3.  In Alaska, there is a detailed in-season 
management program that tracks catch amounts of 
all groundfish species that have TACs (including 
bycatches in groundfish fisheries that are not 
targeting that species and which may discard 
those) and closes fisheries to ensure that TACs are 
not exceeded.  The Observer Program is an 
important part of TAC monitoring.  Some target 
groundfish fisheries may not achieve their TAC 
allocations because the TAC of another species 
that is bycatch in their fishery has been reached.  
Bycatch (discards) of target groundfish species 
amounted to about 6% of the total groundfish 
catch in 2001, a rate that is not exceptional 
compared to other major fisheries in the world. 
 
This tier system places a buffer between the 
overfishing levels and the annual ABC.  Stocks in 
Tiers 1-3 include an additional precaution by 
decreasing fishing mortality rates for stocks that 
fall below the MSY level.  Tier 1 stocks include 
further precaution by reducing the target fishing 
mortality rate in direct relation to the level of 
uncertainty regarding the stock’s productive 
capacity.  However, very few stocks have 
sufficient information to be in Tier 1.  Some stocks 
are still managed as a complex of species, which 
may not ensure the most optimum management of 
the lesser abundant stocks in the complex.  The 
lack of sufficient information to estimate MSST 
for some stocks is also problematic.  Harvest rates 
used to establish ABCs are reduced at low stock 
size levels, thereby allowing depleted stocks to 
rebuild rapidly.  If the biomass of any stock falls 
below Bmsy or B40% (the long term average 
biomass that would be expected under average 
recruitment and F=F40%), the fishing mortality is 
reduced relative to stock status.  This serves as an 
implicit rebuilding plan should a stock fall below a 
reasonable abundance level.  Specific 
consideration of genetic biodiversity in the 
retained species has not been made in the 
management measures although the present 
system of temporal/spatial allocations of TAC may 
provide protection in this regard.  Evaluation of 
the effects of fishing on genetic diversity of the 
target species has been made in the draft 
Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement 
for Alaskan Groundfish Fisheries, which used 
MSST as a threshold to evaluate these impacts.  
Further detailed review of single species harvest 
strategies (from a single species and ecosystem 
point of view) can be found in an independent 
panel analysis provided to the North Pacific 
Fishery Management Council (http://www.fakr. 
noaa.gov/npfmc/Reports/f40review1102.pdf). 
 
10.3.3 Bycatch species 
 
There are several facets of bycatch management in 
Alaska groundfish fisheries depending on the type 
of bycatch.  There is accounting of bycatch of 
target groundfish species that are discarded and 
these amounts are included in total catch estimates 
of the target species.  In 1998, an improved 
retention and utilization (IR/IU) amendment was 
approved that mandated the retention of pollock 
and cod in groundfish fisheries.  No special 
consideration is being given to species biodiversity 
among the bycatch species although biodiversity 
measures are under development that include 
target and non-target species. 
 
40 
For bycatch of non-target species, there is a 
special category called prohibited species that is 
managed.  In the eastern Bering Sea, prohibited 
species include salmon, herring, crab, and halibut, 
and caps are placed on the amounts that can be 
caught by groundfish fisheries.  In addition, there 
are many gear/area restrictions that have been 
made to provide further protection to these 
prohibited species, which are the target for non-
groundfish fisheries and are managed by either the 
State of Alaska (salmon, herring, and crab) or an 
international commission (halibut).  These 
agencies management practices promote 
sustainable stocks, and in some cases catch 
mortality in groundfish fisheries is accounted for 
in stock assessments of these prohibited species.  
A detailed history of the regulation of Alaska 
groundfish fisheries with regard to prohibited 
species can be found at http://www.fakr. 
noaa.gov/npfmc/Reports/bycpaper.htm.  There are 
many time/area closures, gear restrictions, 
seasonal TAC apportionments designed to reduce 
bycatch of prohibited species.  One benefit of IFQ 
fisheries (sablefish) is reduced catch of prohibited 
species.  There is a detailed reporting and 
accounting system, that includes at-sea observers, 
that provides estimates of total catch and discard 
mortality for prohibited species in groundfish 
fisheries to ensure that catches are not exceeded.  
In some groundfish fisheries, particularly flatfish 
fisheries, the halibut cap is constraining and 
prevents the flatfish fisheries from achieving 
ABC.  Groundfish fishery bycatch removals of 
these prohibited species do not significantly 
impact these stocks, because groundfish fishery 
removals are much less than directed harvest 
amounts.  Halibut and herring are in good 
condition, some crab stocks are considered 
overfished (although directed fishing may not have 
been the proximal reason for some crab stocks 
falling below their MSSTs).  Some western Alaska 
salmon stocks are depressed and impact of bycatch 
removals are unknown for some stocks.  In 
general, the detailed accounting and bycatch cap 
approach to management of these species is very 
successful at providing protection to this group, 
although these constrain the groundfish fishery 
and thus may not be optimal from an economic 
point of view. 
 
Bycatch of a “forage species” group is managed to 
prevent target fisheries from being initiated on 
those species, which include smelts, stichaeids, 
euphausiids, sandlance, sandfish, lanternfish, and 
gunnels.  These are generally species with fast 
turnover rates but are not well-studied in the 
region.  A maximum retention allowance (MRA) 
for each groundfish fishery is set at 2% of the total 
fishery catch for these species in aggregate.  
Commerce in these species is currently prohibited 
except for the small amounts retained under the 
MRA rates and for artisanal or subsistence uses.  
Abundance estimates are not available for these 
species, so their status is unknown.  This group of 
fast turnover rate species is likely afforded 
sufficient protection by these maximum retainable 
bycatch limits that prevent target fisheries from 
starting on them. 
 
Although species contained in the “other species” 
category are included in the target species 
management description above because they are 
managed using ABCs derived from the target 
species tier system, the species in this category are 
not currently economically important in North 
Pacific groundfish fisheries, but were perceived to 
be ecologically important and of potential 
economic importance, as well.  “Other species” in 
the BSAI and GOA include sculpins, skates, 
sharks, squid and octopus (squid is broken out as a 
separate group in the BSAI).  Stock assessments 
are conducted and TACs are established for other 
species and separately for squid in the BSAI.  A 
TAC for other species in the GOA is set at 5% of 
the sum of target species TACs each year.  It is 
possible under current “other species” 
management that a species, or even a species 
group, could be disproportionately exploited while 
the overall aggregate other species TAC is not 
reached.  This potential is a concern because the 
“other species” category includes groups with 
extremely diverse habitats and life history 
strategies.  In addition, data limitations plague 
different groups within this category.  The lack of 
biomass estimates for cephalopods has been a 
source of difficulty for determining stock status 
relative to bycatch and the lack of adequate 
species identification in the catch data hampers the 
analysis of catch trends for skate and sculpin 
species.  In the current FMP tier system for setting 
acceptable biological catch, these species groups 
41 
are in the lowest tiers, which set allowable catch 
equal to average bycatch or biomass times 75% of 
the natural mortality rates.  It is difficult to 
determine how much protection is afforded by a 
TAC set with the use of these data-poor criteria, 
although it is likely to be better than unrestricted 
catch.  Discussions are underway for improving 
the management of these groups through improved 
detail in the catch reporting, etc.  In the meantime, 
a directed fishery for skate species in the GOA has 
started, which may spur additional management 
action.  Survey estimates for most of these species 
do not indicate worrisome trends, however, sharks 
and cephalopods are not well-estimated in surveys, 
so their population trends are not well-known.  
Because of the vulnerable nature of some of the 
species in this group, the present system of TAC 
setting for the aggregate may not provide 
sufficient protection. 
 
A group of invertebrate species called HAPC 
(habitat areas of special concern) biota has been 
defined.  This group of species consists of living 
structural habitat species such as corals, sea 
pens/whips, sponges, and anemones.  Some of 
these species, particularly deep water corals, are 
very long-lived and sensitive to fishing removals.  
Various proposals for management of this species 
group have been made, including prohibition of 
commercial sale and harvesting of corals and 
sponges.  However, action is pending.  Bottom 
trawl surveys, which provide an index of 
abundance of sea pens/whips and anemones, do 
not indicate problems with those groups.  Though, 
corals and sponges are not well-sampled by trawls 
and their distribution and status is not well-known.  
An environmental impact statement (EIS) is being 
prepared to provide alternatives for protection of 
essential fish habitat, and protection may be 
provided for these HAPC biota, depending on the 
alternative chose.  Monitoring of catch amounts 
and biomass amounts of these species is occurring, 
and development of an EIS is nearly complete. 
 
Finally, there is a group of non-specified species 
that are bycatch in groundfish fisheries.  These 
include a huge diversity of fish and invertebrate 
species.  There is currently no management and 
some catch monitoring of species in this category, 
although retention of any non-specified species is 
permitted.  The complete lack of reporting 
requirements may be problematic.  For example, 
bycatch of grenadiers, a non-specified species 
group, is higher in the GOA than the catch of all 
species in the “other species” category combined.  
Grenadiers are long-lived species that may be 
vulnerable to fishing; however, they are afforded 
no protection within the existing non-specified 
species category.  An ad hoc committee, 
consisting of federal and council scientists and 
regional fishery managers, is discussing a 
framework system for identifying and protecting 
vulnerable species in the bycatch (including target, 
other, and non-specified).  However, meetings are 
ongoing and a final plan has not yet been 
completed.  Research is continuing to identify 
population trends in non-commercial species 
relative to fishing and climate but the effects of 
fishing on these species are not well-known.  
Species identification is very detailed for fish 
species in research surveys of the area but not very 
detailed for non-commercial invertebrates.  Design 
of effective management measures to reduce 
bycatch will require additional economical and 
socio-cultural information. 
 
10.3.4 Threatened or protected species 
 
A number of threatened or endangered species or 
habitats for these species occur in Alaskan waters 
and these species are afforded protection under the 
Endangered Species Act.  The species include 
some marine mammals, seabirds, and fish.  The 
full list is available at http://www.fakr.noaa. 
gov/protectedresources/esaakspecies.pdf.  Other 
marine mammal species are also afforded 
protection under the Marine Mammal Protection 
Act.  The general approach to fisheries 
management with respect to these species is the 
management of direct takes of species, utilization 
of take reduction devices, area closures to protect 
foraging habitat, and harvest rules that provide 
additional protection to key forage of some of 
these species. 
 
With the exception of salmon, the majority of 
these species are long-lived K-selected species 
with a variety of foraging strategies.  There are 
difficulties in quantifying the level of natural 
variability in some of these stocks due to the past 
effects of direct harvest of mammals and 
degradation of freshwater habitats of salmon, etc.  
42 
that confound interpretation of species declines.  
However, there have been observations of large 
variability in species abundance trends over the 
last 30 years that has been partly linked to climate 
variation, particularly for salmon. 
 
Fishery management restrictions that have been 
placed on Alaska groundfish fisheries because of 
ESA concerns are primarily for protection Steller 
sea lion and short-tailed albatross.  Measures are 
in place to protect Steller sea lions in near-shore 
and critical habitat areas through fishing closures 
in certain areas and temporal-spatial distribution of 
the catch.  Overall abundance of key Steller sea 
lion prey (walleye pollock, Atka mackerel, and 
Pacific cod) is regulated through a lower threshold 
harvest when biomass reaches B20%, which is 
more conservative than is used in single species 
harvest strategies for those stocks.  The primary 
management concern for short-tailed albatross is 
direct take in fisheries and very low take limits 
have been set (4 takes within 2 years) that will 
trigger consultation.  In addition, seabird 
avoidance measures for fishing vessels have been 
mandated. 
 
Level of information and uncertainty is 
approximately Tier 5:  understanding and data are 
limited to providing general indications of status 
and change – often with many different plausible 
interpretations.  There is large uncertainty, 
particularly with regard to Steller sea lions, of the 
factors influencing the dynamics of this stock.  
Large amounts of research funding and efforts of 
independent panels of scientists are being spent to 
evaluate the reasons for decline. 
 
Status of Steller sea lion and short-tailed albatross 
with respect to endangered listing reference point:  
these animals are still considered endangered.  
Status of the fishery interactions with these species 
with regard to direct take limits:  interactions are 
below the direct take limits.  Status of the fishery 
interactions with regard to the indirect effects of 
fishery removal of prey:  enactment of biological 
opinion protection measures should remove any 
adverse modification of habitat or jeopardy of 
species existence due to fishing but this is 
uncertain due to the difficulty in quantitatively 
evaluating these indirect effects. 
Direct take catch limits, gear modifications, and 
take reduction teams all provide good mechanisms 
for reducing direct takes of endangered and 
protected species.  Take limits, such as PBR rates, 
vary relative to status of the stock of concern, 
relate to the stocks’ productivity, and provide a 
sufficient trigger for management intervention.  
The qualitative nature of determining the degree of 
species protection provided, due to area closures, 
and prey species harvest control rules, when 
indirect interactions are the concern, is 
problematic and uncertain.  Considerable work 
needs to be done to determine more quantitative 
standards for reference points dealing with fishery 
potential to jeopardize continued existence or 
adversely modify critical habitat of listed species 
for these indirect interactions.  However, detailed 
analysis of Steller sea lions and measures for their 
protection have been instituted through a Steller 
sea lion protection measures EIS and a Biological 
Opinion.  The EIS recently won a national award 
because of the open public process that was 
employed, including the use of a unique 
stakeholder constituent committee to develop the 
alternatives. 
 
No consideration has been given to community 
biodiversity, except through protection of the 
individual species (individual community 
members).  Development of biodiversity indices is 
ongoing, though typically marine mammal and 
seabird communities are excluded from these 
because there is a lack of population abundance 
and trend information for many of the species. 
 
10.3.5 Habitats 
 
Habitat management for Alaska groundfish 
fisheries includes the consultation process 
mentioned above and the development of an EFH 
EIS.  In addition, habitat protection is provided by 
a variety of area closures and bottom trawling 
restrictions that have been put in place over the 
years (see summary of these measures in 
http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/npfmc/Reports/efhjdc.p 
df).  An unusually productive and fragile area 
called the Sitka Pinnacles Marine Reserve has 
been designated.  This habitat is known to contain 
higher diversity of species than surrounding areas.   
Habitat assessment reports were developed for 
43 
EFH of all managed species in Alaska 
(http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/habitat/efh_har). 
 
The BSAI and GOA groundfish management 
regions encompass a variety of habitat types.  The 
Bering Sea shelf consists primarily of sand, mixed 
sand and mud, and mud substrates and an outer 
continental shelf.  The Gulf of Alaska has shallow, 
deep and slope areas which consists of soft (sand 
to gravel) or hard (pebble to rock) substrates).  The 
Aleutian Islands region also consists of soft and 
hard substrates.  Efforts are ongoing to better map 
the distribution of living organisms that provide 
structural habitat to fish but the AI and GOA are 
known to have deep-water corals that are long-
lived.  Sponges also occur in all of these areas and 
are thought to be relatively long-lived, though 
present research is showing a range of recovery 
times.  Other epifauna that could be impacted by 
fishing gear include seapens/whips and anemones; 
not much is known of recovery rates of these 
organisms.  Of the infauna in the regions, larger, 
longer-lived organisms include clams.  Smaller, 
higher turnover rate organisms such as polychaetes 
also occur throughout the region but little effort 
has been expended in mapping these distributions 
after U.S. surveys in the late 1970s and early 
1980s although bottom typing efforts are ongoing. 
 
Little is known of the natural levels of variability 
of these organisms although research is being 
conducted to compare densities and average sizes 
of organisms in trawled versus untrawled regions.  
A habitat impacts model has recently been 
developed to provide a quantitative basis for 
relating fishing intensity and habitat recovery in 
the process of evaluating fishing effects. 
 
The main management response at this point is the 
requirement for federal agencies to consult with 
NMFS if that agency’s actions may adversely 
effect EFH and for NMFS to provide conservation 
recommendations if deemed necessary.  For 
details on the consultation process see 
http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/habitat/efh/Consultatio
n/1_0.htm1#nmfs. 
 
Reference points being developed for evaluating 
habitat effects relate to a standard for determining 
“adverse effects on EFH” that are “more than 
minimal and not temporary.”  Temporary impacts 
are defined as those that are limited in duration 
and that allow the particular environment to 
recover without measurable impact.  Minimal 
impacts are described as those that may result in 
relatively small changes in the affected 
environment and insignificant changes in 
ecological functions.  In the EFH context, the 
terms “environment” and ”function” refer to the 
features of the environment necessary for the life 
history requirements (spawning, breeding, feeding 
and growth to maturity) of the managed species 
and their function in providing that support.  
Presently, for managed Alaska groundfish, the 
standard for assessment is the stock’s ability to 
remain above the minimum stock size threshold. 
 
Assessment of the status of groundfish species 
relative to this threshold is presently being done in 
the EFH EIS and the Programmatic Alaska 
Groundfish EIS.  It appears that groundfish stocks 
are above this threshold (for those in which MSST 
can be calculated else MSST is unknown).  
Although MSST is a quantitative standard, it 
cannot be defined for some stocks due to lack of 
data.  Also, it provides only an indirect method of 
assessing the possible effects of habitat changes on 
a species’ productivity.  It seems there could be 
confounding factors such as physical 
environmental regime shifts which could make a 
species’ production appear to be unchanged, while 
habitat degradation could be ongoing and not 
noticed until a regime shift occurred.  Further 
research is required to quantitatively link habitat 
amount and condition with species production.  
The Sitka Pinnacles Marine Reserve was 
designated, in part, because of the high diversity of 
organisms in that region, so some consideration to 
diversity is being given in management.  Also, the 
EFH EIS and Programmatic Groundfish EIS 
consider fishing effects on several types of 
diversity, including species diversity and structural 
habitat diversity.  Fishing effects on structural 
living habitat and benthic communities are 
considered qualitatively in these EIS documents 
that are being prepared. 
 
10.3.6 Food webs 
 
The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act allows the modification of a 
target species biological yield estimates to be 
44 
modified to an optimum yield (OY) that takes into 
account the protection of marine ecosystems; that 
is prescribed on the basis of the MSY from the 
fishery, as reduced by any relevant economic, 
social, or ecological factor.  Examples of 
ecological factors are given in the National 
Standard guidelines and include predator-prey or 
competitive interactions, and dependence of 
marine mammals and birds or endangered species 
on a stock of fish.  Thus, fishery managers are 
given direction in modifying maximum biological 
yield targets to account for ecological factors such 
as predator/prey relationships.  In practice, an OY 
range is specified in the management of Alaskan 
groundfish.  In the Bering Sea, the maximum OY 
is capped at 2 million metric tons and has proved 
constraining on individual target fisheries.  
Guidelines indicate that OY should be a target 
reference point and not an absolute ceiling, but 
rather a desired result.  The Bering Sea OY cap 
was not derived from a specific food web concern 
but rather as a general way of buffering total 
removals in the system. 
 
The SAFE document of Alaska groundfish 
fisheries includes an Ecosystem Considerations 
Chapter that summarizes the best information 
available on the status and trends of various 
ecosystem components that are predators and prey 
of managed groundfish species and includes the 
results of multi-species and ecosystem models of 
the region.  Individual stock assessment reports 
now include a qualitative evaluation of the trends 
of predators and prey of the managed species.  
Some species, such as walleye pollock, are 
cannibalistic and stock assessment of those species 
implicitly includes consideration of the 
cannibalism via the stock-recruitment curve. 
 
As mentioned previously, the NPFMC has also 
designated a “forage fish” category that consists of 
relative fast turnover rate forage species such as 
gunnels, bathylagids, gonostomatidae, lanternfish, 
sandfish, sandlance, smelts, stichaeids, and 
euphausiids.  A maximum retainable bycatch rate 
(MRB) for each groundfish fishery is set at 2% of 
the total fishery catch for these species in 
aggregate.  Commerce in these species is currently 
prohibited except for the small amounts retained 
under the MRB rates and for artisanal or 
subsistence uses.  Abundance estimates are not 
available for these species so their status is 
unknown.   
 
Key forage species that are important prey of the 
endangered Steller sea lion and that are the target 
of commercial fishing in the region include 
walleye pollock, Pacific cod, and Atka mackerel.  
Measures are in place to protect Steller sea lion 
foraging in near-shore and critical habitat areas 
through fishing closures in certain areas.  Overall 
abundance of key Steller sea lion prey (walleye 
pollock, Atka mackerel, and Pacific cod) is 
regulated through a lower threshold harvest when 
biomass reaches B20%, which is more 
conservative than is used in single species harvest 
strategies for those stocks. 
 
The direct feeding interactions that involve target 
species primarily revolve around middle-trophic 
level species such as walleye pollock and Atka 
mackerel, which are targets of fisheries and are 
prey of other target groundfish species in the BSAI 
and GOA.  Cannibalism by walleye pollock in the 
EBS is well-documented and explains part of the 
density dependence in the spawner-recruit 
relationship of pollock.  Single-species models of 
pollock in the EBS and GOA have been developed 
that include predation by other species, including 
target groundfish.  A multi-species VPA model 
has also been developed for the EBS.  The 
MSVPA showed that most predation mortality on 
target species tends to occur on juveniles.  Trophic 
level of the groundfish catch has also been 
estimated for the EBS, AI, and GOA and appears 
to be relatively high and stable (see p. 224 of the 
Ecosystem Considerations Chapter of the SAFE at 
http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/refm/docs/2002/ecochap
.pdf). 
 
Levels of natural variability of feeding interactions 
that involve target species are relatively high 
because of the variability in predator stock size 
and in abundance of target species that serve as 
prey.  MSVPA results from the Bering Sea show 
that predation mortality of walleye pollock at age 
1 can have relatively large inter-annual variability. 
 
Aside from the Steller sea lion prey protection 
rules mentioned above (B20% lower threshold for 
pollock, cod, and Atka mackerel biomass and 
closed areas in sea lion foraging areas), the forage 
45 
species maximum retainable bycatch rules, and 
stock assessment scientist consideration of 
qualitative trends in predator or prey abundance 
for their stock (which could be used to justify 
changes in ABC recommendations but which, so 
far, has not been used in that way), there are no 
other planned management responses. 
 
Level of information available to parameterize 
models of groundfish predator/prey dynamics is 
relatively good – MSVPA has been developed for 
EBS and statistical catch-at-age models that 
include predators have been developed for EBS 
and GOA pollock.  There are still lots of 
uncertainties about seasonal feeding dynamics, 
spatial/temporal variability in predation, and the 
form of the functional feeding responses of 
groundfish. 
 
Multi-species reference points have not been 
defined for this system and for cannibalistic 
species such as walleye pollock and Pacific cod, 
such reference point may result in Fmsy estimates 
that are higher than in the single species case.  
Pollock, cod, and Atka mackerel are above the 
B20% value established for Steller sea lions and 
MRBs of forage species have not been exceeded.  
The 2 million OY cap on total groundfish catch in 
the EBS is frequently reached and constrains the 
groundfish catch.  For example, the sum of the 
recommended ABCs for BSAI groundfish in 2003 
was 3.2 million t, which is 1.3 million t above the 
OY cap. 
 
These reference points provide protection for 
endangered species that rely on target groundfish, 
prevent target fisheries from starting on some 
small pelagic fish stocks, and provide an overall 
cap on catch that is less than the sum of the 
individual ABCs.  However, these do not provide 
explicitly for the needs of other predators in a 
particular year (i.e., through predator set-asides).  
The OY cap constrains catch but does not 
explicitly constrain catch for a particular species, 
thus leading to ABC reductions based on 
economic considerations but not due to food web 
considerations. 
 
The EBS food web in general has been described 
in Aydin et al. (2002) (http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/ 
Publications/AFSC-TM/NOAA-TM-AFSC-
130.pdf) based on parameterization of an 
ECOPATH model of the system.  Similar models 
are being developed for the GOA and AI.  
Ecosystem indicators are also under development 
and the present state of indicators are reflected in 
the Ecosystem Considerations Chapter of the 
SAFE (http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/refm/docs/2002/ 
ecochap.pdf).  Most of these indicators reflect 
status and trends of environment, fishing pressure, 
and species abundance trends.  Aggregate 
indicators reflecting various ecosystem level 
measurements including types of diversity are also 
being developed. 
 
There is a fair amount of natural variability in the 
EBS, AI, and GOA food webs based on 
observations of species responses to climate 
variability.  Although primary and secondary 
production are not regularly evaluated in these 
systems, there have been unusual phytoplankton 
blooms occurring in recent years, along with 
dramatic changes in non-target species abundance 
including fish, birds, and marine mammals. 
 
There are no planned management responses that 
consider the food web except the inclusion of 
ecosystem information in the Ecosystem 
Considerations Chapter of the SAFE and the 
ongoing efforts to develop reference points that 
deal with the food web in general.  General 
thresholds for evaluating fishing effects on 
ecosystem attributes have been developed as part 
of the requirements under the National 
Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) to evaluate 
ecological effects of human activities (Table 
10.3.1).  Environmental impact statements are 
being prepared that evaluate fishing effects on 
these ecosystems.  Significance thresholds have 
been defined for food web effects of fishing on 
pelagic forage availability, spatial and temporal 
concentration of fishery on forage, removal of top 
predators and introduction of non-native species.  
Ecosystem level thresholds dealing with fishing 
effects on energy redirection and removals have 
been defined along with thresholds for species 
diversity, functional diversity, and genetic 
diversity.  Application of the thresholds require 
knowing either the natural levels of variability of a 
species or system attribute and the potential for 
fishing to bring that attribute either below a single

species limit such as MSST or to bring a system 
attribute outside the range of natural variability.  
Since these thresholds are difficult to define 
quantitatively in practice, indicators are used to 
evaluate whether particular organisms, groups, or 
ecosystem attributes are changing in an 
undesirable direction (Table 10.3.1). 
 
Level of information presently being used in this 
evaluation is mainly Tier 5 – understanding and 
data is limited to providing general indications of 
status and change – often with many different 
plausible interpretations.  No target reference 
points at the general ecosystem level are being 
used with the exception of keeping the sum of the 
individual species ABC limits within an OY range.  
This range was originally set equal to 85% of the 
range of the summed species-specific MSYs in the 
BSAI, in part to insure that future harvests would 
be sustainable.  Status of the food web relative to 
an ecosystem reference point is not known and 
heavy reliance is still placed on individual species 
status. 
 
Strengths/limits of general food web reference 
points:  the OY range provides some general food 
web protection although this should be evaluated 
using ecosystem models that have been developed 
for these regions.  It might be more appropriate to 
use OY constraints for trophic level groups (the 
forage fish MRBs could be thought of as an OY 
constraint for a trophic level group, though some 
central forage species such as walleye pollock and 
Atka mackerel might need to be included in an OY 
constraint that considers all mid-trophic level 
species).  Single-species thresholds appear to 
provide ecosystem protection – by protecting the 
individual pieces, you protect the whole.  
However, there are many uncertainties about the 
effects of fishing on the food web as a whole and 
the work developing ecosystem indicators and 
ecosystem models will be useful to evaluate the 
potential effects. 
 
10.3.7 Physical environment 
 
Fishery management in Alaska is primarily 
concerned with the effects of the physical 
environment on individual species production 
patterns because there is a great deal of evidence 
that climate influences are a strong driver of 
species recruitment in the region.  Other agencies 
such as the Environmental Protection Agency and 
State of Alaska have responsibility primarily for 
water quality issues, and fishery impacts on water 
quality through dumping of fish-processing offal 
or vessel-related pollution is monitored and 
evaluated by these entities.  Individual permits are 
given to fish processing plants and have “total 
maximum daily load” (TMDL) plans required for 
impaired waters to attain water quality standards 
for Alaskan waters.  TMDLs are specified 
individually to fish processing plants and depend 
partly on the characteristics of the receiving water 
basin with respect to water depth and exchange.  
See the following web link for more details on 
environmental protection in Alaska:  
http://yosemite.epa.gov/R10/Homepage.NSF/web
page/Alaska's+Environment?opendocument. 
 
Also, fishery managers are not directly involved in 
managing activities that might be root causes of 
global warming, although there is potential for this 
warming to have significant impacts on fish 
production in Alaska.  Environmental impact 
analyses of the effects of fishing on the 
environment also consider the effects of fishing on 
the physical environment through water pollution.

Appendix 10.4 Present state of implementing ecosystem-based fishery 
management off the West Coast of the United States:  Pacific Coast 
groundfish fisheries 
 
10.4.1 Regulatory legislation, documents, and 
actions 
 
The federally-managed groundfish fishery off the 
states of California, Oregon and Washington 
occurs on the shelf and slope areas in the U.S. 
EEZ.  The fishery is managed by the Pacific 
Fishery Management Council (PFMC;  
http://www.pcouncil.org) under the Pacific Coast 
Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (http:// 
www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/gffmp/fmpthru17.p
df), with catch levels proposed in the Groundfish 
Environmental Impact Statement (Groundfish EIS; 
http://www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/gfspex/gfspex
03.html).  In-season adjustments are often 
recommended by the PFMC (http://www.pcouncil. 
org/groundfish/gfins.html) and must then be 
approved by NMFS (see http://www.nwr.noaa. 
gov/1press/sfdpress.htm, or in greater detail at 
http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/1sustfsh/groundfish/gfm
gmt.htm).  Management measures are generally 
adopted biennially; that is, every two years, the 
PFMC and NMFS convene to update and adjust 
policies that are currently in place. 
 
The Pacific Coast groundfish fishery has limited 
entry, open access, recreational, and tribal 
components.  Most harvest is allocated to the 
limited entry permit fishery, comprised of 
separately regulated trawl and fixed-gear fleets, 
with the majority of landings coming from 
trawlers.  The open access commercial fishery 
may not use trawl gear directed at groundfish 
harvest.  Harvests are currently managed by 2-
month cumulative trip limits and seasonal or 
annual quotas, although there is ongoing debate 
about transitioning to an individual fishing quota 
(IFQ) system. 
 
Several management tools have been used by the 
PFMC, NMFS, and Congress in order to regulate 
groundfish harvest, lower bycatch, and reduce the 
probability of overfishing along the Pacific Coast.  
The first notable example is the regular use of 
time/space closures.  Such closures can be enacted 
when certain species reach defined quotas in a 
season or year.  Recently there have also been 
several large-scale closures throughout the EEZ, 
often referred to as Groundfish Conservation 
Areas (GCAs).  These areas are large and 
complexly shaped polygons defined by many 
waypoints in order to cover the appropriate depth 
strata.  Examples include the large Rockfish 
Conservation Area (RCA) designed to protect 
bocaccio, canary rockfish, darkblotched rockfish, 
and Pacific ocean perch off the Pacific Coast; the 
Cowcod Conservation Area (CCA) located off the 
coast of southern California; and the Yelloweye 
Rockfish Conservation Area (YRCA) located off 
the coast of Washington.  The PFMC is currently 
exploring the use of electronic vessel monitoring 
systems (VMS) to track the movement of fishing 
vessels through closed areas. 
 
A second management tool is restricted size of 
footropes on shelf trawls.  Rollers on footropes 
may be no greater than 8 inches in diameter, which 
essentially prevents fishing in rocky habitats.  
Management believes that rocky habitats are 
critical for several life stages of groundfish, 
particularly rockfish, and that protecting these 
habitats by making them effectively untrawlable 
will improve rockfish rebuilding efforts. 
 
Another notable management tool was the recent 
buyback of trawl permits and vessels in the limited 
entry fishery.  This federal legislation, 
implemented in 2003, was intended to reduce 
fishing effort on groundfish by roughly one third, 
and also to increase financial stability among the 
fishing community.  It ultimately funded the 
buyout of 92 vessels and 92 groundfish permits. 
 
The Observer Program for the Pacific Coast 
groundfish fishery (http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/ 
research/divisions/fram/Observer/) provides data 
critical in the conservation and management of 
groundfish, non-target species, and habitat.  
Concerning bycatch issues, observer data are used 
to study patterns of co-occurrence among target 
and bycatch species, to identify gear-specific 
bycatch and discard activity, and to note changes 
50 
in fishing behavior as vessels approach limits for 
target species.  Observer coverage in the Pacific 
Coast groundfish fleet is designed so that all 
limited entry trawling vessels are observed for a 
minimum of two consecutive months every two 
years.  The exception is the at-sea hake fishery 
(i.e., vessels that fish hake and deliver their catch 
to at-sea processing vessels).  These boats receive 
100% observer coverage.  Some further 
observation effort is implemented into fixed gear 
fisheries and for special projects. 
 
10.4.2 Retained species 
 
The general approach to retained species 
management is the annual TAC-setting process 
and an Observer Program to monitor TAC.  Stocks 
or stock complexes within the retained (target) 
species category are part of this process.  TACs 
are set by the PFMC and are less than or equal to 
the ABCs set by stock assessment scientists, which 
are in turn less than defined overfishing (OFL) 
levels.  Alternative ABCs, optimum yields (OY) 
and TACs for the fishery are prescribed in Chapter 
2 of the Groundfish Environmental Impact 
Statement (Groundfish EIS; http://www.pcouncil. 
org/groundfish/gfspex/gfspex03.html).  The 
alternatives are offered because there are multiple 
goals of fishery management that may be at odds; 
chief among these potentially conflicting goals are 
the desire to maximize the economic value of the 
fishery and the need to rebuild depleted stocks that 
often co-occur with healthy target species.  Federal 
fishery scientists are, in general, responsible for 
deriving ABC and OFL estimates that are then 
reviewed by a panel of federal, state, and tribal 
scientists that are on the Groundfish Management 
Team of the PFMC.  These ABCs and OFLs are 
then presented to the Council’s Science and 
Statistical Committee for review.  The Committee 
then makes the ABC and OFL recommendations 
to the PFMC. 
 
Routine (i.e., on-going but regularly updated) 
restrictions on limited-entry fisheries are in place 
for several species, based on PFMC 
recommendations and on the classification of 
certain groundfish stocks as overfished.  Principal 
among those restrictions is setting seasonal quotas.  
Routine restrictions are in place for all groundfish 
caught by open access or recreational fisheries.  
The PFMC can recommend, and NMFS can 
implement, management actions beyond the scope 
of the routine actions in order to address arising 
conservation or socio-economic concerns. 
 
Eighty-nine fish species are actively and 
specifically managed under the Pacific Coast 
Groundfish FMP:  62 species of rockfish (59 
species of the genus Sebastes; shortspine and 
longspine thornyheads; California scorpionfish); 
12 species of flatfish (arrowtooth and starry 
flounder; Pacific sanddab; butter, curlfin, Dover, 
English, flathead, petrale, rex, rock and sand sole); 
6 roundfish (lingcod, cabezon, kelp greenling, 
Pacific cod, Pacific whiting (hake) and sablefish); 
1 morid (finescale codling); 1 grenadier (Pacific 
rattail); and 7 elasmobranchs (leopard and soupfin 
sharks; spiny dogfish; big, California and longnose 
skates; ratfish).  However, the FMP states that any 
“rockfish” (i.e., a member of the family 
Scorpaenidae) is subject to management under the 
FMP.  Pacific halibut are not managed under this 
FMP. 
 
The dominant retained species are hake, rockfish, 
sablefish, and flatfish.  Hake are potentially highly 
productive, with relatively short generation times 
(8 years) and high fecundity.  Flatfish vary broadly 
in terms of life span and size-specific fecundity.  
Sablefish have longer generation times than hake 
and episodic year class strength that appears 
strongly related to climate conditions.  Rockfish 
are potentially subject to depletion due to fishing, 
with varying degrees of generation times often 
measured in decades; for example, overfished 
rockfishes have generation times ranging from 14 
years (bocaccio) to 44 years (yelloweye).  In 
general, rockfish (particularly large-bodied 
species) are slow to mature.  They are generally 
live-bearing fish with very high fecundities, but 
survival of larvae is very poor and episodic. 
 
Rockfishes occupy a broad range of trophic roles, 
owing to their species diversity, size diversity, and 
habitat diversity.  Their diets range from 
gelatinous zooplankton to piscivory, with 
euphausiids being almost universally important.  
Larval, juvenile, and smaller adult rockfish 
provide food for other groundfish, albacore, 
marine mammals, sharks, and birds.  Juvenile and 
adult hake eat mostly euphausiids, with larger 
51 
adults also eating amphipods, squid, herring, 
smelt, crabs, and other fish, including juvenile 
hake.  Juvenile hake are also eaten by lingcod and 
some rockfish, while adults are eaten by sablefish, 
sharks, and marine mammals.  Sablefish diets 
include fishes, cephalopods and benthic 
invertebrates.  Young sablefish provide food for 
seabirds, fishes (including lingcod), and marine 
mammals.  Juvenile and adult flatfishes eat benthic 
invertebrates and fish, and are preyed upon by 
sharks, marine mammals, sablefish, and other 
flatfish.  Some flatfish such as English sole inhabit 
estuaries at early ages, and are vulnerable to 
wading birds. 
 
Population status of Pacific Coast groundfish is 
monitored through regular field surveys, using 
both fishery-independent trawl surveys.  These 
surveys provide data on spatial distributions, 
habitat-specific abundances, and age structure of 
groundfish populations in trawlable habitats.  
NMFS scientists are attempting to improve 
monitoring of groundfish stocks in untrawlable 
habitats, but that is a relatively new research 
effort.  Additionally, acoustic surveys concurrent 
with mid-water trawl sets are done to monitor 
hake, which inhabit mid-water regions.  Data from 
these surveys and from the fishery are 
incorporated into formal stock assessment 
analyses (described in http://www.pcouncil.org/ 
groundfish/gfspex/gfspex03.html, Section 3.4.2).  
A compilation of Stock Assessment and Fishery 
Evaluation (SAFE) documents for Pacific Coast 
groundfish from 2001 to present is available at 
http://www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/gfsafe.html.  
However, given the time required to conduct a 
stock assessment, the number of species in the 
FMP and the constant need to update assessments 
of key species, the number of species actually 
assessed is far less than the total number of species 
managed.  For example, the current plan for stock 
assessments through the 2007-2008 biennium will 
include 23 species, prioritized according to 
population status and importance to the fishery. 
 
For the purposes of management, a species in this 
FMP is designated at “precautionary status” if its 
spawning stock biomass (SSB; the biomass of 
mature females) falls below 40% of the estimated 
unfished biomass.  Species in this category 
currently include Dover sole, sablefish, and 
shortspine thornyhead (these three species are 
collectively referred to as the DTS complex).  
More drastically, a species is considered 
“overfished” if its SSB is below 25% of the 
estimated unfished biomass.  Under that criterion, 
the following species are considered overfished:  
bocaccio, canary rockfish, cowcod, darkblotched 
rockfish, lingcod, Pacific ocean perch, widow 
rockfish, and yelloweye rockfish (Pacific hake 
were declared overfished in 2002, but the 2004 
stock assessment indicates that they are above the 
40% threshold).  When fish are declared 
overfished, formal rebuilding plans are initiated; if 
SSB reaches 10% of initial, a zero catch policy is 
enacted.  Rebuilding plans are currently in place 
for five of the overfished species (bocaccio, canary 
rockfish, cowcod, lingcod, and yelloweye 
rockfish); owing to the long generation times and 
low productivity of rockfish species, target 
biomasses for the four rockfish listed here are not 
expected to be achieved before 2021 (bocaccio) to 
2095 (cowcod).  Other species listed in FMP are 
considered either at target level, above target level, 
or have insufficient information to assess their 
populations. 
 
10.4.3 Bycatch species  
 
A draft of the NMFS bycatch mitigation EIS for 
the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery is available at 
http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/1sustfsh/groundfish/eis_
efh/pseis/DPEIS/.  This document goes into 
considerable detail about many of the species 
listed in both this section and the subsequent 
“Threatened or Protected Species” section.  It 
describes several alternative strategies for 
reducing the total bycatch and subsequent bycatch 
mortality in the groundfish fishery through 
changes in total fleet size, fishing times, or trip 
limits; these alternatives have broad overlap with 
management strategies intended to optimize yield 
in the overall fishery while concurrently rebuilding 
stocks of depleted species, as drawn out in the 
Groundfish EIS.  
 
Non-target species are often incidentally caught in 
groundfish gear in the Pacific Coast fishery.  
Many categories of bycatch species are recognized 
within the FMP, including overfished groundfish, 
highly migratory species (HMS), coastal pelagic 
species (CPS), prohibited species, and protected 
52 
species.  Incidentally caught overfished groundfish 
are often referred to as bycatch because they are 
rarely targeted, particularly those that have SSBs 
below the critical threshold of 10% of unfished 
biomass.  Nonetheless, they are unavoidably 
caught in fisheries targeting more abundant 
groundfish, particularly Pacific hake.  Although 
this bycatch is recognized as unavoidable, the 
PFMC and NMFS attempt to restrict it by setting 
low quotas for these species and monitoring those 
catches in season through the Observer Program.  
Meeting or exceeding these quotas may result in 
activation of a time/space closure such as an RCA. 
 
HMS (tunas, billfishes, pelagic sharks) are mostly 
pelagic and are rarely caught in groundfish gears, 
and thus are not likely to be affected by groundfish 
FMP, unless as affected by effort reallocation 
because of the vessel buyback or general decreases 
in groundfishing opportunities.   
 
CPS (e.g., squid, sardine, anchovy, mackerel) are 
often caught in the Pacific hake fishery, which is a 
mid-water trawl fishery, but in much lower 
numbers in gears associated with the bottom.  
Bycatch in the hake fishery can be large; for 
example, over 80 metric tons of squid were caught 
in the 2001 at-sea hake fishery.  The Groundfish 
FMP and the Groundfish EIS require that these 
species’ status be considered in terms of impact.  
For that reason, take of these species is monitored, 
although any decisions would have to be made in 
conjunction with the CPS FMP, under which these 
species are managed.  Current assessments 
indicate that biomasses of sardine and mackerel 
are increasing relative to other coastal pelagics, 
with both species being harvested at near-record 
levels.  In contrast, squid population dynamics are 
highly variable and recruitment-driven.  Sardine 
and anchovy population dynamics may be strongly 
driven by interactions with climate regimes 
(Chavez et al., 2003) as well as by fishing. 
 
There is a special category of non-targeted species 
called prohibited species, meaning that they must 
be returned to the sea as quickly and safely as 
possible if brought on board.  In the Pacific Coast 
Groundfish FMP, prohibited species include all 
Pacific salmon, Pacific halibut, and Dungeness 
crab (although Dungeness crab take is permitted in 
California waters, if done in accordance with 
California law).  In addition, joint-venture 
operations (in which foreign processors receive 
fish caught in the U.S. EEZ) are prohibited from 
receiving salmon, Pacific halibut, Dungeness crab, 
and species outside of specific authorization or in 
excess of limits or quotas.  Pacific salmon bycatch 
mostly occurs in the hake fishery, and specific 
fleet-wide bycatch rates have been established for 
Chinook salmon, which is the species most likely 
to overlap spatially and temporally with hake (the 
allowable rate has rarely been exceeded).  These 
fish must immediately be returned; if retained, 
they are turned over to the state at which they are 
landed.  Pacific halibut may only be kept if they 
are tagged, provided that the tag is returned to the 
International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC), 
the body that manages Pacific halibut.  Bycatch of 
Pacific halibut that results in halibut mortality 
probably does not affect the overall status of the 
halibut population because halibut caught in 
Washington, Oregon, or California waters are 
likely at the most southerly extent of the 
population and do not represent large numbers of 
the spawning stock biomass.  However, fishing 
mortality of Pacific halibut incidentally caught by 
groundfish gear does count toward the total quotas 
established by the IPHC.  Although this bycatch 
has been substantial on occasions, it is likely to 
have been curtailed in recent years by the 
establishment of RCAs, which overlap with much 
of the Pacific halibut habitat off Washington, 
Oregon, and California.  Dungeness crab are often 
taken in groundfishing gears, and all must be 
returned to the sea in Washington and Oregon.  
Despite this regulation, some mortality probably 
occurs, especially when the crabs are in the 
vulnerable soft-shell state following molting.  
Some RCA boundaries have been extended into 
shallower waters in molting seasons to minimize 
this impact.  In California, some take of 
Dungeness crab is allowable in accordance with 
state regulations, which include size limits and a 
strict prohibition on the retention of female crabs. 
 
Many species receive additional protection under 
the ESA and MMPA, namely marine mammals, 
sea birds, and sea turtles, although information on 
interactions between groundfish fisheries and 
these species is limited by relatively scant 
observer coverage in all but the hake fishery.  
ESA-listed species that may be affected by 
53 
groundfish harvest include certain stocks of 
Pacific salmon (covered above in the prohibited 
species section) and four species of sea turtles, 
namely the loggerhead, leatherback, green, and 
olive ridley.  Turtles may occasionally by injured 
or killed by interactions with groundfishing boats 
(direct harvest mortality, collisions with boats, or 
pollution), but such incidents are very rare, 
especially compared to the mortality inflicted on 
turtles by other fisheries, such as longline 
fisheries.  Incidental take of marine mammals and 
sea birds is rare, according to observer data, but 
these animals certainly interact with groundfish 
boats by scavenging discard. 
 
Recently, the deep-sea coral communities of the 
continental slopes have attracted special attention 
with respect to groundfish fisheries.  In slope 
regions, large footrope gear is permissible, and 
there is growing concern that these and other trawl 
gears will impact deep-sea coral communities, 
which are poorly studied.  This concern is 
especially acute because trawling effort in the 
deeper waters has increased following the 
establishment of the large-scale RCAs on the 
continental shelf.  Although the overall decrease in 
trawling effort brought on by the vessel/permit 
buyback will mitigate the effort shift to some 
extent, the impact of groundfish fishing on deep-
sea coral communities remains unknown. 
 
More generally, bottom trawling likely has a 
strong impact on substrates and associated 
organisms, especially benthos such as sponges, 
anemones, sea cucumbers, sea stars, sea pens, sea 
whips, and sea urchins, and benthopelagic 
organisms such as octopus.  Little is known about 
the intensity or impact of trawl contact with 
benthic communities, although some 
generalizations can be hypothesized; for example, 
one might expect trawl impacts to be greater in 
relatively stable habitats that are not affected by 
strong current or wave action, compared to more 
disturbance-prone habitats associated with higher 
wave energy.  Also, there are some fishing 
grounds off California, Oregon, and Washington 
that are known to be regions of relatively high 
trawling intensity (NRC, 2002).  However, the 
overall quantitative impacts of bottom trawls on 
these habitats remain unknown.  As part of the 
pending development of an Essential Fish Habitat 
Environmental Impact Statement (EFH EIS), 
however, these issues will be addressed.  
Additionally, in the standard fishery-independent 
trawl surveys of groundfish abundance conducted 
annually by NMFS, biologists are now recording 
data on benthic invertebrates, although these data 
are essentially limited to presence/absence of 
species. 
 
Many other species are bycatch in groundfish 
fisheries.  These include a huge diversity of fish 
and invertebrate species, including some of 
commercial value, that are managed at state or 
federal levels in other FMPs (e.g., California 
halibut, shrimp, crab, sea cucumber).  There is 
currently no management and some catch 
monitoring of species in this category, although 
retention of any non-specified species is permitted.  
The impacts of different management alternatives 
on species such as shrimp, elasmobranchs, bony 
fishes, and other species not directly covered by 
the FMP are discussed in the groundfish draft 
Programmatic EIS (available at 
http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/1sustfsh/groundfish/eis_
efh/pseis/DPEIS/).  Development of effective 
management measures to reduce bycatch will 
require additional economical and socio-cultural 
information. 
 
10.4.4 Threatened or protected species 
 
In addition to the prohibited species noted in the 
previous section, there are several threatened and 
protected species in the EEZ off of the Pacific 
Coast.  These species fall under three overlapping 
categories (ESA-listed species, marine mammals, 
and seabirds) reflecting four mandates (the ESA, 
the MMPA, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act 
(MBTA), and Executive Order 13186).  Further 
protection for some of these species is outlined in 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act. 
 
A number of threatened or endangered species or 
habitats for these species occur in Pacific Coast 
EEZ waters, and these species are afforded 
protection under the Endangered Species Act.  The 
species, and their ESA designations, include 
Pacific salmon (numerous threatened and 
endangered stocks in California, Oregon, and 
Washington), sea turtles (endangered:  
leatherback; threatened:  green, loggerhead, olive 
54 
ridley), seabirds (endangered:  California least 
tern, California brown pelican, short-tail albatross;  
threatened:  marbled murrelet), and marine 
mammals (endangered:  blue whale, fin whale, 
humpback whale, North Pacific right whale, sperm 
whale;  threatened:  Steller sea lion, Guadalupe fur 
seal, sea otters in California).  Marine mammal 
species not listed are either not threatened or 
endangered or, they have not been recorded in 
Pacific Coast EEZ waters.  The status of some 
species, such as the southern resident killer whale 
(listed as “depleted” under the MMPA), is the 
subject of some controversy.  One mollusk, the 
white abalone, is endangered in this region, 
although it dwells in rocky, untrawlable habitat 
and is thus not likely to be directly affected by 
groundfish harvest. 
 
Take of Pacific salmon was discussed above in the 
Bycatch section; as prohibited species, Pacific 
salmon must be returned to the sea as quickly as 
practicable, regardless of their status under the 
ESA. 
 
Interactions between sea turtles and groundfish 
gear or vessels are rare; most fishery-related sea 
turtle mortality appears to occur in gillnets (which 
are not used in groundfish harvest) or longlines 
(which are rarely used by the groundfish fleet in 
depths inhabited by sea turtles). 
 
No directed harvest may occur on any marine 
mammal, regardless of their threatened or 
endangered status, because of protections afforded 
by the Marine Mammal Protection Act.  The 
MMPA further establishes management for 
cetaceans and pinnipeds (by NMFS) and sea otters 
(by the Fish and Wildlife Service) and requires 
regular stock assessments of all populations.  
Mammals whose population status is depleted 
receive protections that may include restrictions on 
fishing in their habitats or on fish species that they 
prey on.  However, the Pacific Coast groundfish 
fishery is considered a relatively low-risk fishery 
in this context. 
 
Direct incidental take of marine mammals by 
Pacific Coast groundfishing vessels has occurred 
in the hake fishery, but the take has been minimal.  
For example, between 1997 and 2001, by far the 
most frequently taken marine mammal was the 
Dall’s porpoise, but the average annual take by the 
entire hake fleet was 2.56 porpoise/year.  Observer 
coverage from the remainder of the fishery 
indicates little direct take; for example, observer 
coverage of 30% of the limited entry fixed gear 
and 10% of the limited entry trawl fishery in fall 
2001 to fall 2002 found a total take of 11 marine 
mammals, mostly California sea lions.  The 
overall fishery is regarded as Category III under 
the MMPA, indicating a remote likelihood of 
mortality or injury related to fishing activity.  The 
more likely impact of groundfish fishing is in 
changes to marine mammals’ food supply, 
whether by removal of their prey, alteration of the 
food webs in which they exist, or through 
provision of food via discard.  These impacts, 
however, are not well-known.  The judgment of 
the PFMC is that groundfish harvest in this region 
has little overall impact on marine mammals 
compared to other human activities. 
 
Besides the ESA-listed seabirds mentioned 
previously, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
designated several birds as “species of special 
conservation concern.”  These include black-
footed albatross, ashy storm petrel, gullbilled tern, 
elegant tern, arctic tern, black skimmer, and 
Xantus’s murrelet.  Furthermore, migratory 
seabirds receive protection from the MBTA, an 
international treaty among the United States 
Canada, Russia, Japan and Mexico that forbids the 
killing, taking, or possessing of a migratory bird.  
Executive Order 13186 mandates agencies to work 
with the Fish and Wildlife Service to establish 
Terms of Understanding about the impact of 
human activities upon migratory birds; NMFS and 
the FWS are currently developing such Terms for 
migratory birds.  Finally, the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act requires compliance among NMFS-enforced 
fisheries management actions and all legislation 
designed to protect seabirds. 
 
As with marine mammals, direct impacts of 
groundfishing on birds appear to be minimal, 
whereas indirect effects are poorly studied.  
Observer data suggest that direct mortality of 
seabirds is very low; for example, observer 
coverage of 30% of the limited entry fixed gear 
and 10% of the limited entry trawl fishery in fall 
2001 to fall 2002 found a total take of 5 birds.  
Most interaction appears to be birds scavenging 
55 
offal on decks or discarded overboard, but there 
are little spatial or temporal data to quantify such 
interactions with birds and vessels. 
 
10.4.5 Habitats 
 
EFH for Pacific Coast groundfish is defined 
generally as the aquatic habitat necessary to allow 
for groundfish production to support long-term 
sustainable fisheries for groundfish, and for 
groundfish contributions to a healthy ecosystem.  
To satisfy this description, EFH must be described 
for all life history stages of managed species.  EFH 
descriptions have been incorporated into the 
groundfish FMP in both Section 11.10 and in a 
detailed appendix (http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/ 
1sustfsh/efhappendix/page1.html).  West Coast 
groundfish species managed by the groundfish 
FMP occur throughout the EEZ and occupy 
diverse habitat types at all stages in their life 
histories, as listed in the appendix.  EFH for any 
one species may be large (e.g., if a species’ pelagic 
eggs and larvae are widely dispersed) or 
comparatively small (e.g., nearshore rockfishes 
which show strong affinities to a particular 
location or type of substrate). 
 
Most commercial groundfish harvest occurs 
through mid-water or bottom trawling, with lesser 
amounts conducted via fixed gears (traps and pots) 
and longlines.  Bottom trawling is effectively 
limited to areas with soft sediments because of 
restrictions on the diameter of trawl footropes.  
The small rollers allowed on bottom trawls means 
that fisheries are unlikely to fish around rocky 
bottoms to avoid gear damage.  This means that 
rocky reef habitat, which is believed to be critical 
habitat for groundfish and essential to rebuilding 
depleted stocks, is “untrawlable.”  It is, however, 
subject to recreational angling.  Recreational 
fishing for groundfish occurs over a variety of 
bottom types and around artificial structures, such 
as oil rigs, that attract groundfish. 
 
Habitat management for Pacific Coast groundfish 
fisheries includes the standard federal consultation 
process, and also the development of a new EFH 
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which is 
documented at http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/ 
1sustfsh/groundfish/eis_efh/efh/.  The EFH EIS is 
intended to be an improvement over the current 
use of EFH as a classification and management 
tool, which is somewhat unwieldy.  The 
unwieldiness stems from the extent to which 
habitat in the EEZ is considered “essential”:  there 
are some 400 categories of habitat that the Pacific 
Coast Groundfish FMP defines as essential, and 
these habitats collectively comprise all of the 
waters from terrestrial boundaries (including 
coastal high water levels, estuaries, and upper 
limits of riverine saltwater intrusion) to the 200-
mile extent of the U.S. EEZ.  The EFH EIS will 
implement several models in determining priority 
EFH.  In these models, physical and biological 
data on habitats and species are combined with 
fishery impact models to produce multi-scale, 
process-based estimates of habitat responses to 
fishery-related perturbations.  Output from these 
models can then be used to guide management as 
to which habitats and dependent groundfish 
resources are most impacted by fishing activities.  
It will also provide guidance on how to best 
manage sensitive habitat types, such as the deep-
sea coral communities described in the Bycatch 
section.  The draft EFH EIS is scheduled to be 
available for public comment in February 2005, 
and finalized in December 2005. 
 
The standard consultation processes involved in 
identifying EFH, the modeling involved in the 
EFH EIS, and a general assessment of groundfish 
fishing impacts on all marine habitats are data 
intensive endeavors.  Many programs exist for 
identifying and quantifying different habitat types 
in the Pacific Coast EEZ.  At the federal level, 
these efforts include bottom mapping and related 
groundtruthing, using multi-beam sonar 
equipment, echosounders, and remote operated 
vehicles (ROVs) with cameras.  Overlapping 
surveys are done to assess the physical and 
chemical characteristics of the water overlying 
different habitat types.  More recently, NMFS 
biologists have begun efforts to assess the 
populations of groundfish in untrawlable habitats 
through use of ROVs, hook-and-line surveys, and 
mark-recapture studies.  Such information will 
increase the accuracy of coast-wide stock 
assessments. 
56 
10.4.6 Food webs 
 
Studies of food webs involving Pacific Coast 
groundfish have been relatively limited to date.  
“Limited” in this context means that studies 
featuring quantitative, seasonal diet information 
for multiple life history stages of key species are 
rare.  General trophic characteristics of many 
species have been surmised based on stomach 
analyses or stable isotope analysis, and some 
species’ diets (e.g., hake) are quite well 
documented.  Also, some relatively ubiquitous 
prey can certainly be identified as key to 
groundfish production, such as squid, euphausiids, 
and some myctophid fishes.  Additionally, 
community-level food web modeling (using 
ECOPATH with ECOSIM) is being done (Field et 
al., 2001, with more papers forthcoming).  Further 
modeling at the community level (e.g., 
incorporating groundfish into models focused 
primarily on salmon and associated pelagic and 
vertically migrating species) and ecosystem level 
(i.e., incorporating food webs, fisheries, 
oceanography, climate, and biogeochemistry) is 
also under way.  However, this remains an area 
where there is much to be learned. 
 
There is increasing emphasis on food web studies 
as a complement or alternative to traditional 
fisheries management based on single-species, 
stock assessment-based approaches because many 
scientists believe that species interactions have 
strong influence on population dynamics.  Hence, 
in order to successfully manage marine fisheries, 
targeted stocks must be viewed within the proper 
ecological context, particularly the context of 
predator-prey interactions or competition with 
similar species.  Several examples follow. 
 
Worldwide, a growing number of studies suggest 
that fishing influences marine food web structure 
and population dynamics.  Removal of top 
predators by fisheries can produce cascading 
trophic interactions throughout the food web that 
profoundly affect its functioning.  Other studies 
have found that trawl damage to the sea floor and 
its infauna can affect the base of food webs driven 
by benthic production.  Studies of this type are 
generally lacking for food webs involving Pacific 
Coast groundfish. 
 
Some studies have linked food availability with 
reproductive fitness of female rockfish.  Thus, 
production regimes affected by climate are 
propagated through the food web to groundfish; 
this may be true through many other pathways, 
e.g., climate-driven production that supplies food 
to larval groundfish, or factors that affect 
production of euphausiids, which are key prey to 
different stages of most groundfish.  Many 
researchers have concluded that the declines in 
some rockfish stocks over the past 20 years have 
been a result not just of overfishing, but also of 
poor oceanic productivity that led to poor 
recruitment. 
 
Single-species population models, such as basic 
stock assessments, may benefit from incorporation 
of multi-species interactions, as is done in multi-
species virtual population analysis (MSVPA) or 
related modeling.  In MSVPA, age-specific 
predator-prey interactions involving targeted 
species are explicitly incorporated, which may be 
of benefit in the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery 
because so many groundfish consume one another 
or cannibalize their own juveniles.  In 2001, a 
panel of NMFS scientists compiled a Stock 
Assessment Improvement Plan (SAIP;  
http://www.st.nmfs.gov/st2/saip.html) to address 
ways to augment stock assessments through, 
among other things, incorporating climate effects 
and food web interactions into population 
dynamics.  A specific need cited in that document 
for Pacific Coast groundfish was to account for the 
role of climate shifts (and the associated changes 
in productivity) and the increase in pinniped 
abundance, which could signal an increase in 
predation mortality on groundfish. 
 
A food web approach may also be important for 
rehabilitating depleted species of rockfish off the 
Pacific Coast.  The overfished rockfish are 
typically large-bodied and long-lived, and NMFS 
scientists are currently studying the interactions 
between these species and the highly abundant 
small-bodied rockfish that co-occur with them and 
may constrain their rebuilding through 
competition for food.  In addition, the growing 
interest in establishing marine reserves as a means 
of rockfish rehabilitation requires a food web 
perspective because cessation of fishing will affect 
rockfish predators as well as rockfish themselves.  
57 
For example, lingcod co-occur with many depleted 
rockfish.  Lingcod have greater growth rates and 
shorter generation times than rockfish, and thus 
may be expected to respond more rapidly to a 
fishing moratorium than rockfish.  Lingcod are 
also top predators that feed on rockfish.  
Therefore, a marine reserve may actually benefit 
lingcod at the expense of rockfish (Mangel and 
Levin, in press). 
 
In a similar vein, a food web modeling approach 
would be a useful tool in evaluating possible 
responses of key species to fisheries management 
decisions.  For example, the small quotas 
established for overfished species may lead to 
large-scale time-area closures as those quotas are 
reached.  A food web modeling approach could be 
used to ask whether closing the fishery leads to 
unforeseen species interactions.  If, for instance, 
incidental catch of overfished rockfish leads to a 
closure of the hake fishery, a food web model 
could be used to evaluate whether rockfish benefit 
from lower fishing mortality, or suffer greater 
predation mortality inflicted by a relatively large 
(and now unfished) hake population. 
 
In summary, quantitative food web information, 
though recognized as necessary, is lacking for 
Pacific Coast groundfish.  There are relatively few 
specifics concerning food web dynamics in the 
FMP or the Groundfish EIS, which may not imply 
lack of concern so much as acknowledge the 
difficulty in acquiring this information and 
integrating it into an already complex system of 
population assessment and management. 
 
10.4.7 Physical environment 
 
The groundfish community occurs against a 
backdrop of physical conditions characterized by 
bottom topography and sediment type, bathymetric 
gradients, dynamic current structures at many 
spatial scales, water temperatures, and climate.  
All of these factors can influence the distribution 
of groundfish species. 
 
The bottom habitat of the Pacific Coast EEZ is 
characterized by a fairly narrow continental shelf 
(rarely wider than 50 km) and a broader slope;  
most trawling for groundfish occurs on the shelf at 
depths up to about 500 m.  Bottom types are 
typically sand, mud, gravel, boulders, rocky 
pinnacles, or exposed bedrock.  Major geological 
features include capes and points (notably Point 
Conception and Cape Mendocino) and submarine 
features (notably Monterey Canyon, the 
Mendocino Escarpment, and Astoria Canyon) that 
often mark approximate boundaries for shifts in 
groundfish species composition.  Species 
composition of groundfish communities is also 
linked to more basic physical gradients such as 
latitude and depth.  For example, Williams and 
Ralston (2002) classified several distinct 
assemblages of rockfish based on latitude and 
depth, and Love et al. (2002) have found that 
rockfish species diversity increases from north to 
south along the North American coast.  Estuaries 
provide habitat for juvenile life stages of some 
groundfish. 
 
In terms of oceanography, the dominant feature of 
this region is the California Current, a large 
clockwise surface current that branches off the 
North Pacific Current in the region of Vancouver 
Island.  It brings relatively cool water southward 
along the coast until roughly Point Conception, 
where it moves away from the coast.  The 
California Current is strongest and closest to shore 
during the summer.  The deeper, slower California 
Undercurrent runs northward along the Pacific 
Coast.  Dynamics within the California Current, 
along with major wind events, can lead to the 
coastal upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water that 
leads to increased primary production that can be 
propagated throughout the food web.  Upwelling is 
often associated with areas that have submarine 
canyons.  Many eddies and jets occur along the 
coast, often created or influenced by coastal 
geologic features such as capes and points.  These 
localized current dynamics may be especially 
important to groundfish species whose larvae 
undergo a prolonged pelagic larval stage, because 
current-driven dispersal and/or retention of larvae 
can have strong influence on recruitment.  South 
of Point Conception is the Southern California 
Bight, dominated by a counterclockwise eddy of 
relatively warm water. 
 
Much research in recent years has focused on the 
importance of climate variability on growth, 
survival, recruitment, and spatial distribution of 
groundfish.  Variability ranges from changes in 
58 
wind, temperature, and upwelling intensity on the 
scale of 1-2 years (i.e., El Niño Southern 
Oscillations (ENSOs) and La Niñas) to decadal-
scale shifts in climate regime (e.g., the Pacific 
Decadal Oscillation (PDO)).  ENSOs have 
probably received the most attention, and their 
effects appear to vary among different groundfish.  
For example, the warm waters and poor upwelling 
associated with an ENSO often create poor 
conditions for rockfish recruitment and have 
produced incidents of poor growth, reduced 
fecundity, and increased mortality among adult 
rockfish.  Changes in temperature caused by 
ENSO events may also result in dramatic shifts in 
species composition of the groundfish prey 
community (Brodeur and Pearcy, 1992).  In 
contrast, hake recruitment appears to be strong in 
years after ENSOs (Hollowed et al., 2001).  
Different PDO regimes promote differences in air 
pressure, oceanic circulation, and other key 
oceanic properties that affect primary production 
and virtually all consumers.  These changes are 
widely held to benefit different subsets of marine 
organisms, such that shifts from one regime to 
another can result in dramatic changes in 
productivity and species dominance (Francis et al., 
1998).  Among rockfish off southern California, 
the “cool” PDO regime appears to be more 
favorable, as measured by larval abundance 
(Moser et al., 2000).  Pacific Coast groundfish 
may also be influenced by other sources of long-
term variation:  strong year classes for some 
groundfish have been associated with decadal 
scale variation related to Aleutian Low Pressure 
events in conjunction with ENSO events, rather 
than the timing of PDO regimes (Hollowed and 
Wooster, 1992; 1995).  Sablefish year class 
strength off some regions of the West Coast 
appears more related to factors such as seasonal 
Ekman transport and sea level than to adult 
abundance in a traditional stock-recruit 
relationship (Schirripa, unpublished data). 
 
Overall, despite the research dedicated to 
relationships between climate and groundfish, 
there has been little done to incorporate this 
research into management.  Integrating climate 
variability into stock assessments, and 
understanding the relationships between climate 
and recruitment, are high priorities for Pacific 
Coast groundfish management.

Appendix 10.5 Descriptions of multi-species and ecosystem models 
developed or under development in the U.S. North Pacific region that might 
be used to predict effects of fishing on ecosystems 
 
10.5.1 North Pacific multi-species and 
ecosystem models of the Alaska Fisheries 
Science Center  
 
Model hypotheses and descriptions are compiled 
by Kerim Aydin (Alaska Fisheries Science Center;  
Kerim.Aydin@noaa.gov).  This list does not 
include the extensive statistical analyses being 
performed to develop indicators of climate- or 
fishing-related changes in fish production or 
ecosystem characteristics.  Examples of these 
types of indicators and analyses can be found in 
the Ecosystem Considerations section of the 
Alaska Groundfish Stock Assessment and Fishery 
Evaluation (SAFE) document (http://www.afsc. 
noaa.gov/refm/reem/Assess/Default.htm). 
 
Single-species stock assessment models with 
predation 
 
So far we have developed two of these models:  
one for eastern Bering Sea pollock (Livingston 
and Methot, 1998) and one for GOA pollock 
(Hollowed et al., 2000).  We might develop one 
for Aleutian Islands Atka mackerel in the future.  
The purpose of these models is to better 
understand the sources and time trends of natural 
mortality for pollock by explicitly incorporating 
predation mortality induced by their major 
predators into an age-structured fish stock 
assessment model.  We have learned that not only 
is natural mortality at younger ages much higher 
than for adults but that it varies across time, 
depending on time trends in predator stocks.  This 
has given us better ideas of what influences 
predation has on fish recruitment over time and 
helps us to separate predation and climate-related 
effects on recruitment.  We can better show the 
demands of other predators such as marine 
mammals for a commercially fished stock and 
how it might influence the dynamics of that stock 
(although we still need to make progress in 
understanding the effects on marine mammals). 
 
 
 
Bering Sea multi-species virtual population 
analysis 
 
We presently have a multi-species virtual 
population analysis model (MSVPA) for the 
Bering Sea (Livingston and Jurado-Molina, 2000).  
This model includes predation interactions among 
several commercially important groundfish stocks 
and also predation by arrowtooth flounder and 
northern fur seal on these stocks.  This model can 
give us a better idea of the predation interactions 
among several stocks.  We can use output from 
this type of model to understand what the possible 
multi-species implications are of our single 
species-oriented fishing strategies.  Results from 
these forecasting exercises show that a particular 
fishing strategy may have the opposite effect of 
what is intended if multi-species interactions are 
taken into consideration.  We have also done 
multi-species forecasting with this model using 
different hypotheses about regime shifts and 
associated fish recruitment patterns. 
 
Boreal migration and consumption model for the 
eastern Bering Sea 
 
We have an initial version of a spatially explicit 
model of pollock movement and cannibalism in 
the eastern Bering Sea.  We hope to better 
understand the differences in spatial overlap of 
predators and prey, and how that affects the 
population dynamics of each.  The model we have 
modified for the Bering Sea is one being used in 
other boreal ecosystems, BORMICON (Boreal 
Migration and Consumption model).  Migrations 
are prescribed at present with the hope that we can 
prescribe movement based on physical factors in 
the future.  The influence of spatial overlap of 
cannibalistic adult pollock with juveniles on the 
population dynamics of pollock is investigated.  
Hypotheses about larval drift positions and the 
resulting overlap and cannibalism are also being 
explored.  This model could be linked in the future  
 
 
 
62 
to an individual-based larval pollock model and to 
NPZ model that could prescribe zooplankton 
abundance by area as alternate food for adults and 
as primary food for juveniles. 
 
Analytical approach to evaluating alternative 
fishing strategies with multiple gear types 
 
The analytical approach for simulating current 
groundfish management in the North Pacific U.S. 
EEZ involves considering interactions among a 
large number of species (including target, non-
target, and prohibited), areas, and gear types.  To 
evaluate the consequences of alternative 
management regimes, modeling was used to 
predict the likely outcome of management 
decisions using statistics on historical catch of 
different species by gear types and areas.  
Management of the Alaska groundfish fisheries is 
complex given the large numbers of species, areas, 
and gear types.  The managers schedule fisheries 
openings and closures to maximize catch subject 
to catch limits and other constraints.  These 
management actions are based on expectations 
about the array of species likely to be captured by 
different gear types and the cumulative effect that 
each fishery has on the allowable catch of each 
individual target species and other species groups.  
Management decisions were simulated by an in-
season management model that predicts capture of 
target and non-target species by different fisheries 
based on historical catch data by area and gear 
type.  The groundfish population abundance for 
each alternative regime was forecast for a five-
year period beginning from the present.  This 
approach provides a reasonable representation of 
the current fisheries management practice for 
dealing with the multi-species nature of catch in 
target fisheries.  In addition to the model and its 
projected results, agency analysts also used the 
scientific literature, ongoing research, and the 
professional opinion of fishery experts in their 
respective fields to perform qualitative 
assessments. 
 
Influence of advection on larval pollock and 
flatfish recruitment 
 
This model investigates the environmental 
relationship between surface advection during the 
post-spawning period (pollock egg and larval 
stages) and pollock survival.  Wespestad et al. 
(1997) found that during years when the surface 
currents tended north-northwestward along the 
shelf that year class strength was improved 
compared to years when currents were more 
easterly.  They used the OSCURS surface 
advection model to simulate drift.  Subsequently 
(Ianelli et al., 1998), their analysis was extended 
to apply within a stock assessment model.  The 
model uses surface advection over a 90-day period 
to determine the “goodness” of the advective field 
for juvenile pollock.  Similar analyses were 
performed by Wilderbuer et al. (2002) for winter 
spawning flatfish in the eastern Bering Sea. 
 
Shelikof pollock individual-based model 
 
This individual-based model (IBM) was designed 
to run in conjunction with the 3-D physical model 
(SPEM), and the Shelikof NPZ model.  Its purpose 
is to examine, at a mechanistic level, hypotheses 
regarding recruitment of pollock in Shelikof Strait, 
especially as these refer to transport, growth and 
(somewhat) mortality of pollock from spawning 
through the fall of the 0-age year. 
 
GLOBEC nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton 
(NPZ) 1-D and 3-D models 
 
This modeling effort (the NPZ model coupled with 
a 3-D physical model of the circulation of the 
region) is designed to test hypotheses regarding 
the effect of climate change/regime shifts on 
production in the coastal region of the Gulf of 
Alaska, including effects on cross-shelf transport, 
upstream effects, local production, and effect on 
suitability of the region as habitat for juvenile 
salmon. 
 
Steller sea lion individual-based model 
 
This individual-based model will be designed to 
examine how sea lion energy reserves change, 
through foraging and bioenergetics, depending on 
the distribution, density, patchiness and species 
composition of a dynamic prey field (as influenced 
by factors such as potential local depletion by 
fishing).  It should be applicable to any domain 
surrounding a specific sea lion rookery or haul-out 
in the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands or GOA.  Lion 
characteristics such as age, location, life-stage, 
63 
birthdate, etc. are recorded.  Caloric balance is the 
main variable followed for each individual. 
 
Shelikof nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton 
(NPZ) 1-D and 3-D models 
 
This NPZ model was developed to produce a 
temporally and spatially explicit food source 
(Pseudocalanus stages) for larval pollock, 
designed to be input to the pollock IBM.  This set 
of coupled (biological and physical) models was 
developed to examine hypotheses about pollock 
recruitment in the Shelikof Strait region. 
 
Gulf of Alaska walleye pollock stochastic switch 
model 
 
This model was designed as a mathematical 
representation of a conceptual model described in 
Megrey et al., 1996.  It is a numerical simulation 
model of the recruitment process.  A generalized 
description of stochastic mortality is formulated as 
a function of three specific mortality components 
considered important in controlling survival 
(random, due to wind mixing events, and due to 
prevalence of oceanic eddies).  The sum total of 
these, under some conditional dependencies, 
determines the overall survival experienced by the 
recruits.  
 
North Pacific Ecosystem Model for Understanding 
Regional Oceanography (NEMURO) 
 
This model was designed to represent the 
minimum state variables needed to characterize a 
generic NPZ marine ecosystem model for the 
North Pacific.  Ecosystem fluxes are tracked in 
both units of nitrogen and silicon.  Carbon flux 
process equations have been recently added.  Its 
purpose is to examine the effect of climate 
variability on the marine ecosystem through 
regional comparisons by using the same ecosystem 
model structure and process equations. 
 
Mass-balance ecosystem models for North Pacific 
regions of interest (multiple models) 
 
Mass-balance food web models (ECOPATH 
models) provide a way for evaluating the 
importance of predator/prey relationships, the 
roles of top-down and bottom-up forcing in 
modeled ecosystems, and the changes in 
ecosystem structure resulting from environmental 
perturbations (natural or anthropogenic).  
Additionally, the models may provide a way to 
compare natural predation mortality with respect 
to predator biomass and fishing levels, and 
determine the quality of data available for a given 
system. 
 
Eastern Bering Sea shelf model 1 
 
Although many of ECOPATH models were done 
in the past for the Alaska region, the most up-to-
date published model is the effort by Trites et al. 
(1999) for the eastern Bering Sea.  These models 
are highly aggregated over age groups and species 
groups and best highlight gaps in our 
understanding of how ecosystems function, and 
our lack of data on certain ecosystem components.  
Walleye pollock is broken into two biomass 
groups:  pollock ages 0-1 and pollock age 2 and 
older.  This model is useful for testing ecosystem 
hypotheses about bottom-up and top-down forcing 
and to examine system level properties and energy 
flow among trophic levels.  The eastern Bering 
Sea model extent includes the main shelf and slope 
areas north to about 61ºN and excludes near-shore 
processes and ecosystem groups. 
 
Eastern Bering Sea shelf model 2 and western 
Bering Sea shelf model 
 
The second eastern Bering Sea shelf ECOPATH 
model breaks down the earlier model into more 
detailed species groupings to tease apart the 
dynamics of individual species, especially in the 
commercially important groundfish.  Spatial 
extensions to the model include sub-dividing into 
inner, middle, and outer biophysical domains for 
parameter estimation.  The model will be 
calibrated with respect to top-down and bottom-up 
forcing using “check-point” food webs for several 
years in the 1990s and using 1979-1998 time 
series of trawl data and MSVPA/other assessment 
analyses.  The primary purpose of this model is to 
investigate the relative role of natural and 
anthropogenic disturbances on the food web as a 
whole.  A western Bering Sea shelf ECOPATH 
model, built as a joint U.S./Russian project, has 
also been completed (Aydin et al., 2002). 
 
64 
Gulf of Alaska, continental shelf and slope 
(excluding fjord, estuarine and intertidal) model 
 
Throughout the 1990s, there have been extensive 
commercial fisheries in the GOA for groundfish, 
as well as crab, herring, halibut, and salmon.  
Removals of both target species and bycatch by 
these (and historical) fisheries have been 
suggested as a possible cause for the decline of the 
western stock of Steller sea lions, which are now 
listed as endangered species.  An 
ECOPATH/ECOSIM model for the GOA could 
test the hypothesis that fishery removals of 
groundfish and bycatch during the 1990s has 
contributed to the continued decline of Steller sea 
lions. 
 
In addition, a community restructuring, in which 
shrimp populations declined dramatically and 
commercial fish populations increased between 
the 1960s and the 1990s, may have taken place, 
according to small mesh trawl surveys conducted 
by NMFS and ADF&G.  An additional hypothesis 
which could be tested with this model is that this 
trophic re-organization has had a negative impact 
on marine mammal and bird populations in the 
GOA.  Finally, the effects on an apparent increase 
in shark populations on their prey and the relative 
importance of these effects in the whole system 
could be evaluated with an ECOPATH model. 
 
Aleutian Islands and Pribilof Islands models 
 
While the eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska 
ECOPATH models may capture broad-scale 
dynamics of widespread fish stocks, their scale is 
too large to address local depletion.  This may be 
an important issue for island-based fish such as 
Atka mackerel, and may be critical for 
determining the effect that changes in the food 
web may have on the endangered Steller sea lion 
in the Aleutians or on northern fur seals around the 
Pribilof Islands (Ciannelli et al., 2004).  These 
smaller-scale ECOPATH models will be used in 
conjunction with larger-scale models to examine 
the possibility of linking the models across scales. 
 
Prince William Sound model 
 
An ECOPATH model of Prince William Sound 
(PWS) was constructed by a collaboration of 
experts from the region during 1998-1999 (Okey 
and Pauly, 1999).  The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill 
Trustee Council (EVOS) funded this effort for the 
purpose of “ecosystem synthesis.”  Project was 
coordinated by the UBC Fisheries Centre and 
overseen by the NMFS Office of Oil Spill Damage 
Assessment and Restoration.  Prince William 
Sound (Alaska) is well defined geographically;  
spatial definition of the system consisted of 
drawing lines across Hinchenbrook Entrance, 
Montague Strait, and smaller entrances.  The time 
period represented by the model is 1994-1996, as 
this is the post-spill period with the broadest and 
most complete set of ecosystem information.  This 
food web model consists of 48 functional groups 
ranging from single ontogenetic stages of special-
interest species to highly aggregated groupings.  A 
variety of hypotheses are being addressed with the 
PWS model — most relate to the 1989 Exxon 
Valdez oil spill and the fisheries in the area. 
 
Alaska effects of fishing gear and habitat recovery 
model 
 
This model was developed to derive measures of 
the effects of fishing on particular habitats and 
biota.  It uses estimates of fishing intensity, 
sensitivity of habitat features, and recovery rates 
of features to derive indices of effects, termed 
Long-term Effect Indices (LEI).  The model 
contains a number of assumptions about effect 
rates, habitat recovery rates, habitat distribution, 
and habitat utility.  Fishing intensity is derived 
from observer data for 5 × 5 km blocks for the 
years 1998 to 2002.  Reported effort (duration for 
trawls, hooks for longlines, and pot drops for pots) 
was converted into swept areas.  LEI values were 
derived for benthic organism groups such as 
infauna, epifauna, living structure (sponges, soft 
and stony corals, anemones, and stalked tunicates), 
and hard corals. 
 
Loop analysis of community inter-action models 
for Steller sea lions 
 
Because of the large data requirements for mass 
balance models, uncertainty may hinder our ability 
to quantify the effects of fishing and 
environmental change on food webs.  Qualitative 
interaction models, originally proposed by Levins, 
can predict changes in biomass and turnover rates 
65 
of community components following a “press” 
perturbation through an analysis of positive and 
negative feedback loops.  Community models can 
include within trophic level interactions 
(interference competition, mutualism) and non-
organism components, such as nutrients or space.  
Models for Aleutian and Gulf of Alaska 
communities show a range of potential effects of 
fishing and top predators on Steller sea lions that 
are dependent on community structure.  The 
analyses will indicate whether community 
structure, diet, or fish stock depletions are most 
relevant to Steller sea lion population responses, 
and the potential interactive effects of fisheries 
and bottom-up forcing due to climate shifts. 
 
10.5.2 Multi-species and ecosystem models 
that concern groundfish in the U.S. Pacific 
Coast EEZ 
 
Model hypotheses and descriptions are compiled 
by Christopher Harvey (Northwest Fisheries 
Science Center;  Chris.Harvey@noaa.gov).  This 
list is likely incomplete, because West Coast 
groundfish are studied by two regional offices of 
NOAA Fisheries as well as multiple academic, 
state government, and non-government 
institutions. 
 
Sablefish recruitment as influenced by oceano- 
graphic variables 
 
Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) 
Oregon State University scientists are 
incorporating changes in oceanic conditions into 
stock assessment modeling of West Coast 
sablefish.  Juvenile sablefish recruitment has been 
highly variable over the past three decades.  
Estimates of spawning stock biomass over this 
same period point to external factors having 
significant effects on population level recruitment.  
Variation in ocean conditions off the West Coast 
showed a strong relationship to fluctuations in 
sablefish recruitment.  A General Additive Model 
(GAM) revealed significant relationships between 
juvenile recruitment and northward Ekman 
transport, eastward Ekman transport, and sea level.  
The overall model explained nearly 70 percent of 
the variability in sablefish recruitment between the 
years 1974 and 2000.  Stability testing produced 
little change in the dynamics or predictability of 
the model when using less and predicting more 
recruitment years.  Bootstrapping techniques were 
applied to the parameter estimates and the 
resulting distributions were found to support the 
modeling assumptions.  Given the above model, it 
is possible to draw some very preliminary 
conclusions concerning year-class strength of 
cohorts not yet available to the survey gear as well 
as historic year-class strengths.  Using the 
oceanographic variables, estimates of recruitment 
for a given year may be possible by August, 
providing useful early predictions that could 
influence catch quotas.  Historical analysis 
(hindcasting) will provide additional information 
for assessment of virgin stock levels.  Fitting the 
recruitment relationship internal to the stock 
assessment model will allow for fitting, 
hindcasting, and forecasting to be done 
simultaneously. 
 
Effects of climate variability on bocaccio 
population dynamics 
 
Bocaccio are one of the most imperiled rockfish 
stocks on the West Coast, and their rebuilding will 
be constrained greatly by the continued 
exploitation and the climate-mediated infrequency 
of successful recruitment, as demonstrated in 
recent modeling work by NWFSC scientists.  
Scientists from the NWFSC and the University of 
Washington are developing bocaccio population 
models that incorporate the effects of density 
dependence and climate on bocaccio extinction 
risk.  Given the associations elucidated between 
climate and bocaccio recruitment, these 
researchers are running stochastic population 
models that use a variety of possible climate 
change scenarios that may realistically occur in the 
coming decades. 
 
Interactions between rockfish and predators in 
marine reserves 
 
This model was designed to estimate the 
effectiveness of a marine reserve in a community 
context, i.e., with predation on the species 
presumed to benefit from the reserve.  The model 
depicts population dynamics of a bocaccio 
population under three marine reserve regimes:  a 
cessation in targeted offshore fishing on bocaccio 
(although bocaccio bycatch in other fisheries 
66 
continues); an offshore marine reserve (no targeted 
or bycatch removal of bocaccio); and an inshore 
marine reserve (no targeted removal of in near-
shore habitats, where juveniles are most 
abundant).  In a single-species modeling scenario, 
the near-shore reserve model predicted the greatest 
increase in bocaccio biomass.  However, when the 
population dynamics of a bocaccio predator, 
lingcod, was included in the model, the near-shore 
reserve performed poorly in terms of bocaccio 
rebuilding, due to intense lingcod predation on 
juvenile bocaccio, whereas the offshore reserve 
was most successful. 
 
Habitat-specific demographics of groundfish 
 
This study involves using Leslie matrix models of 
groundfish populations to determine what life 
history stages represent critical windows of high 
mortality, and hence represent areas in which 
proper management may reap tremendous benefits 
for maintaining or rebuilding stocks.  The key is to 
identify not just the critical life history stages, but 
the associated habitat.  This may make distinction 
of truly essential fish habitat easier, and also 
provide managers and conservation biologists with 
specific habitat areas upon which to focus their 
energy. 
 
Fishery-driven changes in groundfish community 
composition, size spectra, and population trends 
 
NWFSC and SWFSC fishery biologists are 
modeling changes in groundfish abundance and 
individual body size, based on data collected in 
assessment surveys over the last several decades.  
These data and basic demographic data are being 
used to estimate population growth rates 
(expressed as lambda, the population growth rate 
metric commonly used in the conservation biology 
community) of different groups of groundfish 
(rockfish, flatfish, elasmobranchs) to estimate the 
general trends in community composition that are 
occurring in the groundfish community. 
 
Bioenergetics modeling of climate and fishing 
impacts on rockfish 
 
A generic bioenergetics model for Sebastes, based 
on several laboratory studies of rockfish feeding 
and physiology, is currently being used on two 
fronts.  First is a model of how long-term exposure 
of rockfish to climate anomalies (in particular, El 
Niño events) influences the growth, maturation, 
and reproductive output of rockfish at an 
individual and a population level.  A second 
modeling effort is an extension of the work 
described above that demonstrated the change in 
rockfish size and abundance on the West Coast.  In 
this case, the bioenergetics model is used to 
estimate the change in energy flow through 
different components of the rockfish assemblage.  
These changes may indicate a limit, imposed by 
multi-species interactions and changes in food web 
structure, on rebuilding of some depleted rockfish 
species. 
 
Marine bird prey consumption in California 
 
Researchers at the Point Reyes Bird Observatory 
(PRBO) are developing bioenergetics models of 
common murre to estimate prey consumption, 
including hake, shortbelly rockfish and yellowtail 
rockfish.  This modeling work will make use of 30 
years of diet data collected around the Farallon 
Islands.  The goal is to determine how much food, 
in aggregate, is required to sustain murre 
populations.  Murres feed on krill as well as squid, 
juvenile groundfish and juvenile salmon. 
 
Juvenile rockfish recruitment responses to climate 
variability, as evidenced by bird diets  
 
PRBO researchers have modeled the relationships 
between the occurrence of different species of 
juvenile rockfish in the diets of common murre 
and anomalies in climate, including El Niño, La 
Niña, and PDO events.  Using 30 years of data and 
linear and quadratic models, they compared the 
timing of climate anomalies and the proportion of 
juvenile rockfish in murre diets as a proxy for 
rockfish recruitment.  Their work suggested that 
recruitment of rockfish was strongly, negatively 
affected by El Niño, and that rockfish recruitment 
also responded, although more subtly and with 
long time lags, to regime shifts associated with 
PDOs.

ECOPATH with ECOSIM model of the California 
Current food web 
 
This model was developed by scientists at the 
University of Washington.  Its main purpose has 
been to quantify food web interactions among key 
species and trophic groups in the Northern 
California Current Ecosystem, and to provide a 
framework within which to ask basic questions 
about the effects of fishing on community 
structure and processes.  Work published to date 
includes an ECOPATH model that compares the 
state of the food web (34 different trophic groups) 
in the 1960s, a relatively cool period with low 
fishing pressure; and the 1990s, a warmer period 
with high fishing pressure.  Simulation work with 
ECOSIM, to evaluate the potential system 
responses to fisheries management as part of a 
broader Fisheries Ecosystem Plan (FEP) is 
ongoing. 
 
ECOPATH/ECOSIM/ECOSPACE model of bird 
foraging patterns in the San Juan Islands 
 
This model was originally developed as an 
ECOPATH with ECOSIM model describing the 
general food web structure of waters around the 
San Juan Islands.  It is now being expanded to 
incorporate spatial dynamics (hence the use of the 
spatial module ECOSPACE) and to more 
explicitly model the role of sea birds, which had 
previously been pooled together as one monolithic 
trophic group.  This research, conducted at the 
NWFSC, will explore the role of different species 
of sea birds as predators on marine forage species, 
and will also examine the potential influence of 
marine protected areas on bird-fish predator-prey 
dynamics.  
 
Pelagic food web models of Astoria Canyon 
region 
 
NWFSC scientists, in conjunction with the Global 
Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics program (GLOBEC), 
are using modeling approaches to look at the role 
of top-down and bottom-up processes in 
controlling fish production in the California 
Current upper pelagic zone, largely focusing on 
waters off the coast of Oregon.  Their models 
consider primarily bottom-up approaches (physics 
linked to plankton production linked to fish 
feeding) and integrated food web approaches that 
include food supply, predation, and competition in 
controlling fish populations.  For examining 
plankton production, they are using a variety of 
plankton models, from simple nitrogen-
phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) models to a 
simplified version of the PICES NEMURO model.  
These models can be used to estimate the effects 
of oceanographic events on production that 
supports upper trophic levels.  They are taking two 
approaches to modeling integrated trophic effects 
throughout the pelagic food web.  The first is an 
ecosystem simulation approach (similar to 
ECOSIM).  Because the trophic web off the coast 
is quite complex, they are using guild analysis to 
reduce the food web to a number of functional 
groups, based on diet data collected during 
GLOBEC studies off Oregon and northern 
California.  The fish components of the food web 
focus on pelagic species but include a “bottom 
fish” group, comprised of juvenile flatfish and 
rockfish, that are preyed upon by pelagic 
omnivores.  The second approach uses a structural 
model that describes growth and survival of 
juvenile salmon as they are influenced by a 
number of factors.  Population abundance is 
influenced by various mortality terms, which in 
tern are determined by predator abundances and 
other environmental factors.  Individual weight is 
influenced by the balance of trophic demands 
(food requirement) and food availability.  Food 
availability in turn is determined by prey 
abundances and competition, again with indirect 
effects of environmental conditions.  Groundfish 
comprise portions of the prey and predator groups, 
and also compete for prey groups. 
 
ATLANTIS model of the California Current 
ecosystem 
 
This work is recently underway and will be 
developed over the course of the next several 
years.  It is a joint effort between scientists at the 
NWFSC, the University of Washington, and 
CSIRO (Australia).  The Australian scientists have 
developed a modeling package called ATLANTIS 
that is a spatially explicit ecosystem model, with 
components for flux of water and dissolved or 
suspended materials in three-dimensional space; 
biogeochemical fluxes; climate; food web 
interactions at the level of “trophospecies,” 
68 
i.e., groups of species with similar trophic roles; 
and fisheries.  Model parameterization is 
scheduled to begin in 2004 and will likely require 
at least a year to complete.  Once completed, this 
model can be used to address many questions 
examined with models such as ECOPATH with 
ECOSIM.  However, this will be a more spatially 
explicit model with a greater emphasis on 
ecosystem dynamics and not just community 
dynamics.  In other words, the model will allow 
users to examine spatially explicit questions 
concerning the response of key functional groups 
to fisheries management alternatives (e.g., optimal 
yield alternatives; time-space closures; marine 
protected areas), juxtaposed against variability in 
productivity, climate, and oceanography.

Appendix 10.6 A potential standard reporting format (developed by 
Australia, and currently being used by the U.S.A in their contribution to  
this report)  
 
10.6.1 Introduction 
 
While it is recognised that many human activities 
impact the marine environment (e.g., fishing, 
mariculture, oil and gas exploration and 
development, pollution from land-based activities, 
disruption of freshwater discharges by 
urbanisation, etc.), the most comprehensive 
databases (e.g., target species landings, bycatch 
and discard characteristics, habitat disruption, etc.) 
as to how these impacts are affecting marine 
ecosystems are related to fishing activities.  
Hence, the following format is focused on 
fisheries.  Alternate formats will be assessed or be 
developed that capture the ecosystem effects 
resulting from other human activities, and that 
describe how these ecosystem effects are being 
monitored.  In some cases, ecosystem parameters 
already, or potentially, being monitored may 
capture environmental change, without linking this 
change back to the specific human activity, or 
activities, that in fact might be causing the change 
(e.g., increasing sea water temperature may be the 
result of many causes, some of which relate to 
human activities).  In some cases, additional 
research may then be required to determine 
linkages. 
 
10.6.2 What we hope to achieve 
 
We intend that this national reporting framework 
will be progressively applied to all fisheries in 
PICES member countries and become an integral 
part of fisheries management.  Although the 
primary goal is to assist and improve fisheries 
management, the reporting framework is also 
intended to address an increasing number of 
environmental and other requirements imposed by 
legislation, certification schemes, and consumer 
and community demands. 
 
With a comprehensive, national approach, 
individual fisheries should be well placed to show 
how they are performing against identified 
national EBM objectives.  Further details can be 
found on the Australian ESD reporting framework 
project web site, where the set of generic 
component trees are listed, along with the latest 
version of the case study guidelines and a listing 
of associated events. 
 
10.6.3 The implications of ecosystem-based 
management and its implementation 
 
Within fisheries management, social and economic 
factors have always been included as part of the 
decision-making process.  What is needed is a 
more formal, transparent and structured way of 
considering these issues - which Ecologically 
Sustainable Development (ESD) provides.  The 
ESD process will therefore have implications for 
the level of community input and understanding, 
because it will reveal the machinery of 
management.  Previously, many aspects of 
fisheries and their management have often been 
assessed in an implicit fashion, but now they will 
be looked at explicitly. 
 
In addition to understanding the major 
environmental issues for each fishery - including 
those associated with the target species and the 
wider ecosystem that the fishery operates within - 
fisheries managers need sensible assessments of 
the economic and the social costs, contributions 
and benefits which flow from the fishing activities 
associated with each fishery.  These assessments 
will not necessarily drive the fisheries 
management decisions that have to be made, but at 
least by understanding their implications, fisheries 
managers can determine the best way of managing 
an issue.  If catch or effort levels have to be 
reduced within a fishery, there are often a number 
of different ways of achieving this - one way may 
produce good social benefits, whilst another may 
produce better economic benefits.  For the same 
biological outcome, fisheries managers should be 
trying to find the approach that provides the most 
benefits whilst increasing the transparency as to 
how decisions are being made.  Not all 
stakeholders may agree with the final decision, but 
at least they can see on what basis it was made.  
 
 
10.6.4 Format for summary of reference 
points in local situations to address the 
identified issues under various circumstances 
 
From the fisheries that you are directly involved 
with, please choose a fishery or fisheries that 
illustrate what you regard as best practice for 
management of the various issues being addressed 
in this project (i.e., retained species, bycatch 
species, threatened or protected species, etc.).  It 
may be that different fisheries illustrate best 
practice for different issues, and so several 
fisheries may be reported on here.  It would help 
greatly if all of the issues in this format were 
commented on for each fishery that is reported on. 
It is likely that many of the issues are not relevant 
to some fisheries, and in this case please just make 
that comment in the relevant part of the format 
(i.e., say “not relevant” rather than leaving the 
entry ambiguously blank).
