This report is a compilation of the data resulting 
from a collaborative research project conducted in 
Vancouver Harbour, Canada.  This scientific study 
was part of a Practical Workshop sponsored by the 
Marine Environmental Quality Committee of the 
North Pacific Marine Science Organization 
(PICES).  The goal of the workshop was to 
promote the exchange of information about 
approaches used by PICES member countries to 
assess the biological impact of marine pollution.  
Section I of this report provides an overview and 
history of the workshop, the work plan and 
methods used to conduct the workshop, and a 
summary that includes recommendations for 
future practical workshops of this nature.   
Section II provides a description of the physical 
and oceanographic characteristics of the sampling 
area, as well as information on contaminant 
sources.  Results from the workshop, and 
preliminary data interpretations were presented at 
the PICES Ninth Annual Meeting (PICES IX) in 
2000.  Extended abstracts of these presentations 
are included in Section III.  Tables containing the 
data from the workshop are included in  
Section IV. 
 
Workshop overview 
 
Working Group 8 of the Marine Environmental 
Quality Committee of PICES held a Practical 
Workshop on May 23-June 7, 1999, in Vancouver 
Harbour, Canada.  Twenty-four scientists from all 
PICES member countries participated (see  
Figure 1.1 for a group photo).  Workshop Co-
Chairman Dr. Colin Levings and his staff hosted 
the workshop at the West Vancouver Laboratory, 
of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. 
 
A wide variety of data were collected, including 
community structure of benthic invertebrates and 
fish, evaluation of fish health using biological 
markers and exposure data, evaluation of 
contaminant exposure in intertidal invertebrates, 
imposex in gastropods, and information about 
natural toxins produced by algae.  The cooperative 
sample collections allowed participants to 
experience various methods for environmental 
assessment of marine pollution and its effects.  
Additional opportunities for exchange of 
information occurred through laboratory 
demonstrations of bioanalytical techniques and 
cooperative sample processing that took place at 
the laboratory.  These activities provided an 
opportunity for PICES participants to gain an 
improved appreciation of the approaches and 
techniques used by other member countries to 
assess the effects of marine pollution. 
 
The data resulting from the workshop will be used 
for interpretation of organismal, population, and 
community responses to marine pollution.  The 
biological responses are evaluated in the context 
of exposure to different classes of chemical 
contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbon (PAHs), pesticides, chlorinated 
hydrocarbons, selected metals and organotins 
(e.g., TBT).  The generic results of this Practical 
Workshop should be applicable to other coastal 
areas in the PICES region.  
 
History of Working Group 8  
 
Working group 8 (WG 8) was established by the 
Marine Environmental Quality (MEQ) Committee 
in 1994 to promote the collection and exchange of 
information about approaches PICES member 
countries use to assess the biological impact of 
marine pollution.  To address this issue, WG 8 
organized a Practical Workshop, where 
participants could work together to evaluate 
methods used to assess ecological effects of 
pollution.  The format of the Workshop was 
developed along the lines of the successful

Group of Experts on the Effects of Pollutants 
(IOC/GEEP) workshops whose results have been 
published elsewhere (Bayne et al. 1988, Addison 
and Clarke 1990, Stebbing and Dethlefsen 1992).  
 
Plans were originally made to hold the practical 
workshop in Jiaozhou Bay, China.  However, it 
became impractical for the workshop to be held at 
this location, so the workshop was relocated to 
Vancouver Harbour, Canada, and work plans were 
revised.  After considerable preparation (obtaining 
supplies, laboratory space, research vessel 
support, sampling equipment, affordable room and 
board, travel arrangements, sample permits etc.) 
the workshop was held from May 24 to June 7, 
1999.  Early results of the workshop were 
presented at PICES VIII in Vladivostok, Russia, in 
October, 1999.  Workshop results were formally 
presented at PICES IX in Hakodate, Japan, in 
October 2000.  Plans for publication of the results 
were finalized, and include publication of this data 
report, and individual papers in a special issue of 
Marine Environmental Research.   
Work Plan for the Vancouver Harbour 
Practical Workshop  
 
Site locations 
 
Seven sites were sampled within Vancouver 
Harbour for sediment, benthos and intertidal 
invertebrates (Figs. 1.2 and 1.3).  Fish were 
collected by trawl at five of these sites (Fig. 1.4).  
After field collections were initiated, it was found 
that gastropod species for imposex evaluations 
were not present at these sites, so an additional 3 
sites near Victoria and one near Mission Point 
(near the town of Sechelt, not shown on map) 
(Fig. 1.5) were added to the sampling plan for 
imposex investigations.  
 
Research vessels 
 
The research vessel used for conducting 
sediment/benthos grabs and trawling for bottom 
fish was the R/V Harold W. Streeter (14 m, or  
46 feet) (Fig. 1.6) of the Northwest Fisheries 
Science Center (NWFSC), N ational Marine 
2
 
Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, U.S.A.  The vessel 
was operated by US scientists participating in the 
workshop.  A second research vessel, an outboard 
powered launch operated by staff of the Habitat 
Enhancement Branch, Fisheries and Oceans 
Canada, was used to transport scientists to the 
intertidal collection sites. 
 
Study plan and methods  
 
Several biological responses were evaluated.  A 
list of studies and investigators is shown in  
Table 1.1.  The Workshop activity schedule is 
shown in Table 1.2 and Table 1.3 contains a 
detailed list of the samples collected.

Benthic fish 
Bottom fish were captured with an Otter trawl at 
the five sites where there was sufficient space to 
conduct trawling operations.  Species compo-
sition, number of individuals, and biomass was 
determined for the demersal fish catch in each 
trawl (Fig. 1.7).  A target indicator species was 
retained to examine the relationship between fish 
health and contaminant exposure.  English sole 
(Pleuronichthys vetulus) was selected as the 
indicator species because this species is common 
in Vancouver Harbour, and it feeds on benthic 
organisms living in the sediment (Fig. 1.8).  This 
species is also known to be sensitive to 
contaminant exposure, and much is known about 
the relationship between health of English sole 
and contaminants based on previous studies from 
other areas similar to Vancouver Harbour  (Myers 
et al. 1987, 1994, 1998).

Fig. 1.8 English sole was the target species 
collected for several of the fish studies. 
 
 
Fig. 1.9 Tissue samples from English sole were 
prepared in the shipboard laboratory (Mark 
Myers). 
Two or more trawls were conducted at each site 
until 30 adult English sole were collected.  The 
English sole were maintained alive in seawater 
filled containers until tissue samples could be 
collected.  Immediately after trawling operations 
were complete, the shipboard laboratory was used 
to collect and preserve fish samples (Fig. 1.9).  
Otoliths were removed to determine age.  Blood 
was collected from a subset of fish from two sites 
for vitellogenin assays.  Bile was collected for 
analyses of fluorescent hydrocarbon metabolites, 
as an indicator of aromatic hydrocarbon (AH) 
exposure.  Liver tissue was collected for 
cytochrome P450, metals, chlorinated h ydro-
carbon (CH) and histopathological analyses.  
Muscle was collected for AH, CH and metal 
analyses, and gonads were collected for AH and 
CH analyses.  The stomach was removed from 
each fish and preserved in 10% formalin.   
Table 1.4 shows more detailed information about 
the samples collected from English sole.

May 31 Free day, except for scientists Dr. Horiguchi and Dr. Li, who travelled to Victoria to look for 
snails for imposex research since none were observed at any of the established sites.  Snails 
were successfully located at three sites near Victoria. 
June 1 Sampled sulfur dock site (Benthic site 3A, intertidal site I-2 via launch).  Not enough room to 
trawl for fish at this site.  Returned to Lonsdale Quay (site T-11B) for additional trawls for fish 
community data. 
June 2 Sampled south through Thornbrough Channel to Howe Sound.  One group travelled aboard 
the R/V Harold W. Streeter, another traveled to Gibsons via car and ferry (Trawl site T-50.  
Benthic site B -50.  Intertidal site I -7).  This is a reference site.  Also collected snails for 
imposex studies from Mission Point near Sechelt. 
June 3 Returned to West Vancouver Lab (site T -49) to get additional samples for fish community 
data.  Demonstrated trawling and sediment collection techniques to scientists who may not 
have had an opportunity to observe these operations.  Research vessel departed. 
June 4-6 Processed samples in the laboratory, prepared samples for shipping. 
June 7 Final meeting and barbecue at Workshop Co-Chairman Colin Levings’ house.

Sediment and benthos 
A Van Veen grab was used to collect sediment for 
biological and chemical analyses (Figs. 1.10 and 
1.11).  Three grabs of sediment were collected and 
the surface layer (2 cm in depth) was removed and 
preserved for analyses of organic chemicals and 
metals.  An additional 5 grabs were collected for 
benthic community studies.  The sediment was 
immediately passed through a 0.5 mm sieve.  
Benthic organisms were removed from the sieve 
using forceps and preserved for further study  
(Fig. 1.12).  Another grab was obtained for 
meiofauna samples.  Five replicates cores (one cm 
diameter) to 10 cm depth were obtained, sectioned 
at one cm intervals, and preserved in 5% formalin 
for examination in the laboratory.  These samples 
were archived for future analyses.  The sections of 
one core from each station were used for grain 
size analyses.  After evaporation of preservation 
fluid at air temperature, the sediment was 
analyzed for grain size at KORDI using standard 
sieving and settling tube techniques.  
 
At sites where trawls were also obtained, the 
sediment/benthos site location was established in 
the center of the fish collection area.  This ensured 
that the sediment chemistry, benthos and fish data 
could be correlated.

Intertidal organisms 
Intertidal clams, mussels, and algae were collected 
from the beach at each site (Fig 1.13).  Site 
locations corresponded with those for the fish and 
sediment collections as much as possible, 
however, beach obstructions, or lack of suitable 
organisms, sometimes required the intertidal 
sampling station to be relocated to the next closest 
area.  Clams were collected for hydrocarbon and 
tributyltin (TBT) analyses.  Mussels were 
collected (Fig. 1.14) for analysis of hydrocarbons, 
metals including TBT, condition factor and toxins 
associated with harmful algae.  Clams and mussels 
were cleaned, and removed from their shell.  
Tissues were frozen or freeze dried, and shipped 
to the workshop participants home laboratories for 
further processing and analyses.  
 
Gastropods in the genus Nucella were also 
collected for TBT analyses and imposex 
evaluations.  However, no Nucella could be found 
at any of the established sites.  Therefore, four 
new imposex study sites were established, three 
were near Victoria, and the fourth was near 
Mission Point (Sechelt) (Fig. 1.5).  Anatomical 
measurements of gastropods relating to imposex 
studies were made at the West Vancouver 
Laboratory shortly after collection.  Snails were 
then frozen and shipped to the workshop 
participant’s home laboratories for further 
analyses.  
 
Natural toxins - Harmful algae 
Sediment samples from the benthic sites were 
collected to determine if encysted harmful algae 
were present.  Mussels and other bivalves were 
also collected from intertidal sites for natural 
toxin analyses.  Macroalgae was also collected 
from intertidal sites, and microalgae was scraped 
from the surface of the macroalgae for ARTOX 
analyses.  Occasional bivalves occurring as by-
catch in the bottom trawl samples were retained 
for toxin analyses.

Summary 
 
The Practical Workshop conducted by the Marine 
Environmental Quality Committee of the North 
Pacific Marine Sciences Organization (PICES) 
was the first step by member countries in 
harmonizing methods used to i nvestigate the 
status of contamination in coastal marine systems 
and the associated effects on vertebrate and 
invertebrate species.  Success in harmonizing 
methods should significantly improve our ability 
to compare data collected by multiple 
investigators working in diverse ecosystems in the 
North Pacific.  Greater inter-comparability of data 
also improves our capacity to assess the status and 
trends in chemical contaminant levels and 
biological effects among PICES countries.  
Continued efforts by PICES to harmonize 
assessments of status and trends in contaminant 
levels and effects, should increase the level of 
scientific information available to individual 
member countries to evaluate the relative risks 
from chemical contaminants on the health of their 
coastal ecosystems. 
 
This data report presents the results from the 
collaborative effort to share expertise and 
experience in sampling and analyzing both 
sediment and biota.  The data presented here also 
demonstrates that, during the workshop, we used a 
wide variety of techniques to measure levels of 
contaminant exposure and effects across a broad 
range of biological organization — from 
biochemical endpoints to benthic and fish 
community structure.  A substantive measure of 
the scientific success of the project was the 
commitment by the workshop participants to 
publish the findings from the workshop in the 
peer-reviewed scientific literature.  Publication of 
the findings will make the data available to the 
broader scientific community, demonstrate the 
success o f the workshop, and contribute an 
increased understanding of the effects of 
contaminants on biota of Vancouver Harbour. 
 
The following is a list of lessons we learned in 
conducting this workshop: 
 
- The time committed by the MEQ working 
group to developing w orkshop objectives, 
goals, and work plan was critical to the overall 
success of the workshop. 
 
- Selection of Vancouver Harbour as the site for 
the workshop was important, because of the 
proximity to dry- and wet-lab facilities, 
availability of housing for w orkshop 
participants, and relatively short distances 
between sampling sites that exhibited a range 
in chemical contamination.  Availability of an  
“operations room” for daily briefings and 
discussions of sampling plans by the group 
was also important as adjustments to logistics 
had to be made as the work progressed. 
 
- Unrestricted use of a well-equipped research 
vessel and a small launch provided us with the 
flexibility to adjust daily plans as needed, and 
carry out a wide range of different sampling 
activities. 
 
- The logistical support provided by our 
Canadian colleagues during the workshop was 
instrumental in the overall success of the 
sampling, sample processing and shipment of 
samples. 
 
- Although we were successful in collecting a 
wide range of biotic samples, we were not 
able to conduct many of the chemical and 
biological analyses on a real time basis during 
the workshop.  Because of the wide range of 
complex analyses needed, we could not 
assemble the specialized instruments needed 
12
 
to carry out many of these analyses at the site 
of the workshop.  Therefore, participants 
could not demonstrate their analytical 
techniques or share as much data during the 
workshop as originally anticipated. However 
the present data report should facilitate the 
exchange of data b y the workshop 
participants. 
 
- The rather intense work schedule for the 
workshop made it difficult for participants to 
take time from their personal research to 
participate in projects being conducted by 
their colleagues.  There were opportunities, 
however, for discussion among participants 
after daily sampling and sample processing 
activities were completed.  This opportunity 
was important in initiating exchange of 
technical information on the analytical 
techniques being used. 
 
In conclusion, the Vancouver Harbour Practical 
Workshop was successful in several areas:  1) it 
brought scientists from all PICES countries 
together for the first time to carry out a 
collaborative research project involving sample 
collection and analysis, 2) the careful planning 
and execution of the workshop has led to a data 
set that provides new information on the status of 
chemical contamination in the Harbour, and 3) the 
workshop was a key step in initiating efforts to 
compare and contrast techniques used by PICES 
member countries in assessing the status and 
trends of chemical pollution in coastal 
ecosystems.  
 
There are two recommendations for future PICES 
activities that have a format similar to our 
Practical Workshop.  First, focusing on a more 
limited research approach would provide greater 
opportunity for more in-depth exchange of 
technical approaches and for conducting analyses 
during the workshop.  The ability to share data 
and demonstrate techniques in real time would be 
effective in furthering technology transfer.  
Second, it is our conclusion that the structure for 
the workshop we conducted is applicable to other 
PICES committees, and we encourage the 
committees to consider the value of a Practical 
Workshop format in meeting their scientific 
objectives.

Vancouver Harbour 
 
Vancouver Harbour, here defined as the waters to 
the east of Point Atkinson (Figs. 1.2-1.4), consists 
of three or four water bodies, namely Outer 
Burrard Inlet or English Bay, Inner Burrard Inlet, 
Port Moody Arm, and Indian Arm, a long fjord 
(22 km) which leads to the northeast from the 
main harbour.  All of the PICES sampling stations 
were on the first three water bodies, except for a 
far field reference station located about 15 km to 
the north, in another part of the Strait of Georgia 
(see below).  The approximate length of the inlet 
system is about 30 km with maximum width of 
approximate 4 km in English Bay.  Inner and 
Outer Burrard Inlets are separated by a narrowing 
of the harbour, known as First Narrows.  Further 
to the east, Inner Burrard Inlet and Indian 
Arm/Port Moody are separated by Second 
Narrows.  Each narrows is about 0.5 km wide.  
Maximum depth ranges from about 45 m in Outer 
Burrard Inlet to about 10 m in Port Moody Arm.  
 
The harbour is the largest port on the west coast of 
Canada.  For administration purposes, the harbour 
comes under the jurisdiction of the Vancouver 
Port Authority, and includes port facilities on 
Roberts Bank and the Fraser River estuary, which 
is outside of the area where the PICES workshop 
was focused.  In 1998 there were about 2500 deep 
sea ship landings in the harbour.  About 8 million 
tons of ballast water was discharged into the 
harbour in 1999, and 71.2 million tons of cargo 
(containers and bulk goods) were handled, 
including 1.07 metric ton equivalent u nits of 
containers.  Coal and sulfur are stockpiled in large 
volumes on docks and backup land adjacent to the 
docks.  The shoreline of the harbour has been 
modified for dock construction, with 42.1 km out 
of the total shoreline length of 102.7 km converted 
to riprap revetment or docks.  The undisturbed  
 
shorelines consist primarily of rock and cobble 
beaches, rocky shores, and mudflats, with the 
latter most common in Port Moody Arm. 
 
The following description of the general 
oceanography of the harbour is adapted from 
Stockner and Cliff (1979) who relied extensively 
on Tabata (1971) for their text.  
 
Tides and currents 
 
Tides in Vancouver Harbour are of the mixed 
diurnal type, with mean range of 3.1 m and 
maximum of 4.9 m.  At both First and Second 
Narrows, maximum tidal currents can range up to 
11 km·h
-1
.  These are the areas of greatest tidal 
mixing in the harbour.  In a recent study currents 
at depth were found to be as high as 1.5 m·s
-1
 
(Isachsen and Pond 2000).  The average tidal 
prism for the inlet is approximately 8.4 · 10
7 
m
3 
(Davidson 1979 cited in Lewis and Thomas 1986). 
 
Temperature and salinity 
 
Figures 2.1a and b show sections of temperature 
and salinity through the harbour area obtained 
during a survey in July 1966.  The pattern shown 
is supported by more recent work (eg Davidson 
1979).  The positions of the four stations sampled 
by trawling and the additional sediment sampling 
stations are also shown.  Bottom water tempera-
tures near the locations were about 10-11°C 
except for the shallow stations in Port Moody Arm 
(Stations T -38, B -38 and B -41B).  Surface 
temperatures, which might represent conditions on 
the intertidal zone, ranged from 13-15°C in Outer 
Burrard Inlet to 16–18°C in Port Moody Arm.   
 
Salinity in outer Burrard Inlet is strongly 
influenced by discharge from the Fraser River 
(annual mean discharge 3600 m
3
·s
-1
).  During 
15

(1981). 
 
high discharge periods, the freshwater plume of 
the Fraser River occasionally penetrates through 
First Narrows, into the inner harbour.  Other 
sources of freshwater include the Capilano River 
(regulated, discharge range 4.5 to 25.0 m
3
·s
-1
) and 
the Seymour River (regulated 2.8 to 23.3 m
3
·s
-1
) 
which enters the harbour near the First and 
Second Narrows, respectively.  Bottom salinities 
in July 1966 decreased from about 29.5 psu in 
outer Burrard Inlet to between 22.0 and 24.4 psu 
in Port Moody Arm.  Surface salinities ranged 
from 12 psu in outer Burrard Inlet to 18 – 22 psu 
in Port Moody Arm. 
 
Dissolved oxygen  
 
In the main harbour Stockner and Cliff (1979) 
recorded a seasonal dissolved oxygen (DO) range 
of 5.0 to 10.0 mg·l
-1
, well above the levels that 
would impair marine organisms.  Early 
investigations of pollution in the harbour 
(Waldichuk 1965) established that even in shallow 
Port Moody Arm, at the landward end of the Inlet 
system, the estuarine circulation enabled a 
relatively rapid flushing of bottom water so 
bottom water DO was always > 6.0 mg·l
-1
.  Recent 
investigations connected with dispersal of heated 
effluent in Port Moody Arm have tended to 
confirm Waldichuk’s findings (Taylor et al. 
2001). 
 
Nutrients  
 
Data from 1976 (Stockner and Cliff 1979) showed 
little evidence of eutrophication in Vancouver 
Harbour when their phytoplankton surveys were 
16
 
 
conducted in 1976.  Nitrate levels in June were 
0.120 mg·l
-1
 in Outer Burrard Inlet, 0.175 mg·l
-1
 
and 0.120 mg·l
-1
 in Inner Burrard Inlet and Port 
Moody Arm, respectively.  Since there is less 
discharge of untreated sewage into the harbour 
now relative to when their surveys were made, it 
is likely nutrient levels have not increased. 
 
Sediments 
 
Sediments in Vancouver Harbour range from fine 
mud in deposition areas such as Port Moody Arm, 
to coarse cobble and gravel at First and Second 
Narrows, and on river deltas such as the mouth of 
Capilano River.  However all of the PICES 
stations were located on mud substrates, as shown 
in the benthic invertebrate study of Je et al. (this 
report).  The sediment transport patterns are 
relatively well known.  McLaren (1994) 
concluded that the west portion of Inner Burrard 
Inlet and the north portion of outer Burrard Inlet 
were essentially characterized by a counter-
clockwise circulation with flood-directed sediment 
transport dominating the south side, and ebb-
directed transport dominating the central and 
northern half.  Dredging is needed at First 
Narrows to maintain the navigational channel, 
indicating net deposition at that location.  In Port 
Moody Arm, sedimentation rates of about 1 cm y

have been documented (Pedersen and Waters 
1989) and dredging of deep-sea berths is 
periodically needed in this area.  
 
Thornbrough Channel (Howe Sound) 
 
A far field reference area was chosen in Howe 
Sound, specifically on the southern end of 
Thornbrough Channel near Granthams Landing, 
about 2 km north of the town of Gibsons 
(population about 4000) (Figs. 1.2-1.4).  Both 
trawling and intertidal collecting were conducted 
to match sampling in Vancouver Harbour.  
However, because of bottom conditions, the 
trawling could not be done at the same depth 
relative to the Outer Burrard Inlet station (T-49, 
45 m) and hence the three trawls were completed 
at deeper depths, between 55 to 75 m.  
Thornbrough Channel is connected to the same 
water masses as Vancouver Harbour via deeper 
channels leading to the Strait of Georgia.  
Sediments in the deeper parts of the Channel are 
sand (see Je et al., this report) and beach 
substrates at Granthams Landing consist of sand 
and gravel.  
 
Only a few data are available on the physical and 
chemical oceanography of southern Thornbrough 
Channel.  Although part of Howe Sound, which is 
considered a true fjord, Thornbrough Channel is 
well outside the area of the sill in the fjord and 
thus shows characteristics similar to the adjacent 
Strait of Georgia.  
 
Temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen 
 
Waldichuk et al. (1968) gave limited data from a 
station within one km of PICES station T-50.  In 
September 1960, at 50 m depth, temperature was 
8.6°C and salinity 29.6 psu.  Dissolved oxygen 
was 6.2 mg·l
-1
. 
 
Sediment transport 
 
McLaren et al. (1993) concluded that sediment in 
southern Thornbrough Channel was moving from 
south to north and that deposition was occurring 
in the area of the PICES station.  As shown by Je 
et al. (this report) sediments were sandy at the 
sampling site (mean grain size 0.25 µm).  Some of 
this sediment may be transported to the area from 
nearby islands. 
 
Victoria and Mission Point 
 
Three sites in Victoria, Vancouver Island, and one 
on the eastern side of the Strait of Georgia north 
of Howe Sound (Mission Point, near Sechelt,  
Fig. 1.5), were chosen for imposex studies 
because suitable neogastropod monitoring 
organisms w ere absent at the time of sampling 
from Vancouver Harbour at the PICES stations.  
Victoria is situated at the south east point of 
Vancouver Is. (Fig. 1.5) and is exposed to tidal 
currents from the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca.  
The “estuarine” circulation conditions attributable 
to the influence of the Fraser River discharges on 
the Strait of Georgia are probably at the limits of 
their influence at the most northerly Victoria 
sampling site at Ten Mile Point.  All sites have 
moderately wave-exposed rocks a nd sand or 
sandy-mud beaches.   Tributyltin contamination 
arising from large vessel traffic, either locally or 
17
 
 
through the Straits of Georgia and Juan de Fuca, is 
likely to have the most impact at the Breakwater 
and Clover Point sampling sites; Ten Mile Point is 
likely to be less affected.  Mission Point is 
similarly located in an area where nearby vessel 
traffic is minimal. 
 
Sources of Contamination 
 
Vancouver Harbour 
 
Shipping and industrialization began in 
Vancouver Harbour in the late 19
th
 century.  The 
first major cargo exported from the harbour was 
wood products from the forest industry.  Other 
industries located around the shoreline after 1900 
included petroleum refineries, shipyards, a 
chlorine plant, seafood processing industries, fuel 
loading docks, and marinas.  Some of these 
industries are no longer present on the harbour but 
their footprints or remnant contamination may still 
be present, as described below. 
 
Burrard Inlet has about 36 permitted discharges to 
the marine environment, comprised of m unicipal 
and industrial effluents.  The largest discharge is 
from Burrard Thermal, a gas-fired electrical 
generator.  The operator of Burrard Thermal has a 
permit to discharge 1,700,000 m
3
/day of cooling 
water into Port Moody Arm at a temperature of 
27ºC.  Second in size is the Lion’s Gate Waste 
Water Treatment Plant, the operator of which has 
a permit to discharge 102,000 m
3
/day of primary 
treated sewage at First Narrows (Burrard Inlet 
Environmental Action Program, 1997). 
 
Burrard Inlet also receives effluent from 32 
unpermitted combined sewer overflows (CSOs), 
the largest of which is at Clark Drive.  The two 
Clark Drive overflows (49º17.31¢N, 123º4.65¢W;  
49º17.27’N, 123º4.69¢W) discharge approximately 
143 times per year, with an average annual 
discharge of 20,800,000 m
3
 of mixed stormwater 
and untreated domestic sewage.  Non-point source 
discharges in Burrard Inlet include those from  
29 marinas, 11 ship repair facilities, 7 fueling 
operations, 29 ship loading facilities (sulfur, metal 
concentrates, coal, potash, phosphate rock, grain, 
forest products, chemicals, petroleum) and  
38 anchorages.  Sediments in Vancouver Harbour 
are contaminated with a variety of heavy metals 
and organics, as described by Tkalin et al. (this 
report) as well as several comprehensive recent 
reports by Canadian authorities (Boyd et al. 
1998).  The origins of these pollutants are likely a 
combination of the above point and non-point 
sources. 
 
Thornbrough Channel  
 
There are no industrial developments in southern 
Thornbrough Channel but there are residences on 
the shore.  These homes have septic tanks that 
may contribute contaminants to the groundwater 
above the intertidal zone.  Very large volumes of 
logs from elsewhere in BC are brought to the 
north end of Thornbrough Channel where they are 
dumped into the water, stored, and eventually 
towed for processing at sawmills in the lower 
Fraser River and elsewhere.  A marina is located 
in the town of Gibsons.  Sewage is treated in a 
secondary sewage treatment plant with an outfall 
discharge located at 49 23.13’N, 123  30.78’W.  
Permitted effluent volume is 1389 m
3
/day.  A pulp 
mill located at Port Mellon, about 12 km north of 
the PICES sample station has a permitted 
discharge of 106,500 m
3
/day of pulp mill effluent, 
and 44,500 m
3
/day of cooling water.  The main 
diffuser outfall from Howe Sound Pulp and Paper 
at Port Mellon is located at 49º31.19¢N, 
123º28.50¢W.  This mill was upgraded to 
secondary treatment and chlorine substitution in 
response to amended and new federal Fisheries 
Act and Canadian Environmental Protection Act 
regulations enacted in May 1992.  The Howe 
Sound pulp outfall diffuser has 6 ports ranging in 
depth from 30 m to 115 m below the low water 
mark.  The outfall extends 277 m into the channel 
from shore into northern Thornbrough Channel 
where it enters a predominately northward flow.  
According to McLaren et al. (1993), Thornbrough 
Channel is entirely tidally dominated.  As a result, 
the ebb and flood tidal currents probably disperse 
contaminants to the north and south of the 
discharge point. 
 
Fisheries closures  
 
Vancouver Harbour is closed for commercial 
trawling for fish but portions are open for shrimp 
trawling, primarily for smooth pink shrimp 
(Pandalus borealis eos).  English Bay/Outer 
18
 
 
Burrard Inlet has supported a shrimp fishery for 
over 75 years (Butler 1980).  Until several years 
ago there was large by-catch of a variety of fish 
species in this fishery, including English sole 
(Pleuronectes vetulus), the target species for the 
ecophysiological studies in the PICES workshop.  
By-catch in the shrimp fishery has been reduced 
by the use of mandatory escape devices or 
extruders which are now built into the trawl nets.  
Inner Burrard Inlet was closed to crab fishing in 
May 1992, due to dioxin/furan contamination of 
crab hepatopancreas.  The contaminant-related 
closure was lifted in August 1995, however, due 
to navigational risk, the area between First 
Narrows and Second Narrows is closed to all crab 
and shrimp fishing.  Commercial and recreational 
crab fishing is permitted in Outer Burrard Inlet 
and east of Second Narrows, including Port 
Moody Arm. 
 
Southern Thornbrough Channel is also closed for 
commercial trawling for fish but is an area for 
shrimp trawling.  Howe Sound, including south 
Thornrough Channel, remains closed to 
commercial crab harvesting because of dioxin and 
furan contamination of hepatopancreas.  
Recreational crab harvesting is allowed with a 
consumption advisory issued to the public on crab 
hepatopancreas.

Materials and methods  
 
Sampling  
 
Bottom sediments  
Bottom sediment samples were collected by Van 
Veen grab from seven stations (Section I,  
Fig. 1.2).  Three replicate samples were taken at 
each station.  The surface layer of sediments was 
collected by plastic spoon in pre-cleaned Ziploc 
plastic bags.  Samples were frozen after collection, 
then freeze-dried in the shore laboratory and 
transported to Russia for further analysis.  
 
Mussels  
Mussels (about 30 at each site) were collected 
from rocks and concrete piles during low tide at 
seven stations (Section I, Fig. 1.3).  At all stations, 
mussels Mytilus trossolus were found.  At station 
I-6, oysters Crassostrea gigas were also found.  In 
the shore laboratory, soft tissues were removed, 
weighed, placed in pre-cleaned plastic containers 
and stored frozen.  Then samples were freeze-
dried and transported to Russia f or further 
analysis.  
 
Fish  
Fish were collected by bottom trawl at 5 stations 
(Section I, Fig. 1.4).  Fish muscle samples were 
taken from 5 individuals (English sole) at each 
trawling station and kept in pre-cleaned plastic 
bags on ice aboard the research vessel and then 
frozen in the shore laboratory.  After freeze-
drying, samples were transported to Russia for 
further analysis.  
Analysis  
 
In Vladivostok (Russia), samples of bottom 
sediments, mussel and fish tissues were 
homogenized and distributed for analysis in three 
laboratories:  
 
§ Pacific Research Centre of Fisheries and 
Oceanography (TINRO-Centre);  
§ Pacific Geographical Institute, Far East 
Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences (PGI 
FEB RAS);  
§ Pacific Oceanological Institute, Far East 
Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences (POI 
FEB RAS).  
 
Analytical methods used at the TINRO-Centre are 
briefly described below.  
 
Bottom sediments  
After homogenization, about 0.4 g of dry sample 
was placed in a 50 ml Teflon beaker, HClO
4
, 
HNO
3
 and HF were added, the beaker was closed 
and heated to 50
o
C for 24 hours.  Then HNO
3
 and 
HF were added again and the beaker content was 
dried at 80
o
C.  After that, 1 ml of concentrated 
HNO
3
 and deionised water were added up to final 
volume of 20 ml.  Concentrations of trace metals 
(Al, Fe, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn) were 
determined using the flame atomic absorption 
spectrophotometer NIPPON JARREL ASH, 
model AA-885, with D
2
O background correction.  
For Al analysis, N
2
O-acetylene mixture was used, 
for other metals – acetylene-air mixture.  Contents 
of Cd and Pb were determined using a graphite 
furnace on atomic absorption spectrophotometer 
23
  
HITACHI 170-70, with Zeeman background 
correction.  Detection limits (ppm) were as 
follows: Al and Fe – 2, Cd – 0.0002, Cr – 0.02,  
Cu – 0.005, Pb – 0.04, Zn – 0.02.  
 
Mussels  
After homogenization, 1 -3 g of dry sample were 
soaked in a Teflon beaker with concentrated HNO
3
 
(10 ml) for 24 hours, then the acid solution was 
heated to 120
º
C for 3 hours.  After filtration, trace 
metal contents (Al, Fe, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn) 
were determined using the flame atomic 
absorption spectrophotometer NIPPON JARREL 
ASH, model AA-885.  For Al analysis, N
2
O-
acetylene mixture was used, for other metals – 
acetylene-air mixture.  Contents of Cd and Pb 
were determined using a graphite furnace on 
atomic absorption spectrophotometer HITACHI 
170-70, with Zeeman background correction.

Preliminary results and discussion  
 
 Metals in bottom sediments  
 
Data on trace metal contents in bottom sediments 
are presented in the data section of this report.  
The results obtained in PGI and POI are in 
reasonable agreement with the TINRO-Centre 
data.  According to the Fe content (from 2.3 to 
4.4%), bottom sediment characteristics at 
sampling sites were quite different.  
Concentrations of total copper at all stations 
except B -50 (Howe Sound, reference site) were 
higher than 34 ppm (ERL, Long et al. 1995).  
Maximum concentration, 333 ppm, was observed 
at station B -3A (Sulfur Dock/Copper Ore Dock).  
On the contrary, contents of cadmium at all 
stations except B -3A were below ERL value,  
1.2 ppm.  Concentrations of Pb and Zn exceeded 
those criteria (46.7 ppm and 150 ppm respectively) 
at stations B-3A, B-38 (Port Moody, refinery) and  
B-41B (Port Moody, Ioco).  For all these metals, 
maximum contents were observed at station B-3A 
(Sulfur Dock/Copper Ore Dock).  
 
A large amount of data on trace metal contents in 
bottom sediments of Vancouver Harbour have 
been obtained by Canadian researchers (e.g., 
Goyette and Boyd 1989; Boyd et al. 1998).  Data 
from these two reports for Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn are 
given in Table 1 along with the results from the 
PICES MEQ Practical Workshop.  A similar 
comparison for the most polluted (in 1999) station 
B-3A is shown in Table 2.  In both cases a 
decreasing trend in trace metal concentrations is 
evident.

Metals in mussels  
 
Data on trace metal contents in mussels Mytilus 
trossolus are presented in the data section of this 
report.  The results obtained in PGI and POI are in 
reasonable agreement with the TINRO-Centre 
data.  Concentrations of Al, Fe, Cd, Cu and Pb 
were maximum at station I -2A (Sulfur 
Dock/Copper Dock).  Highest zinc content was 
registered at station I -3A (Longsdale Quay).  
Metal concentrations in soft tissues of mussels at 
other stations were comparable with values from 
reference stations (I-1, PEI, and I-7, Howe Sound).  
 
A large amount of data on trace metal contents in 
mussels has been collected within US NOAA 
NS&T Program (e.g., O’Connor 1998).  Data from 
this paper for Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn are given in 
Table 3 along with the results of the PICES MEQ 
Practical Workshop.  It is necessary to take into 
account that NS&T sampling stations are situated 
outside the “hot spots”.  Therefore, contaminated 
sites in Vancouver Harbour (stations I -2A and  
I-3A) should not be considered as exceptionally 
polluted.  
 
Metals in fish tissues  
 
Data on trace metal contents in fish tissues 
(English sole, muscle) are presented in the data 
section of this report.  Concentrations of Al, Cd 
and Cu were maximum at station T -48 (Cates 
Park, Indian Arm).  Highest zinc content was 
registered at station T -38 (Port Moody, refinery) 
and maximum lead content at station T -11B 
(Longsdale Quay).  Even the highest 
concentrations of copper, zinc and other metals in 
fish muscle were comparable with values from 
reference stations (T-49, PEI, and T -50, Howe 
Sound).  
 
A large amount of data on trace metal contents in 
fish tissues have been collected by Canadian 
researchers (Goyette and Boyd 1989).  Data from 
this report for Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn are given in 
Table 4 along with the results of the PICES MEQ 
Workshop.  As in the case of bottom sediments, 
the decreasing trend in trace metal contents can be 
seen.  
 
Conclusions  
 
According to the results on trace metal contents in 
bottom sediments, station B -3A (Sulfur 
Dock/Copper Ore Dock) is the most polluted 
(among those sampled in May 1999).  Comparison 
with data obtained in 1985-1987 and in 1995 
revealed a decreasing trend in trace metal 
concentrations.  To characterize temporal trends 
more precisely, analysis of dated sediment cores 
might be necessary.  
 
Maximum contents of most metals (except Zn) in 
soft tissues of mussels were observed at station  
I-2A (Sulfur Dock/Copper Ore Dock).  The 
highest concentration of zinc was determined at 
the Longsdale Quay (station I-3A).  
 
In the case of trace metals in fish muscle, even the 
highest concentrations were comparable with 
values from reference sites.  Contents of trace 
metals in 1999 were lower than in 1985–1986.

The Marine Environmental Quality Committee of 
PICES sponsored a Practical Workshop in 
Vancouver Harbour, Canada, during the summer 
of 1999.  The goal of the workshop was to 
exchange information about approaches PICES 
member countries use to assess the biological 
impacts from marine pollution.  To accomplish 
this, scientists from PICES member countries 
worked cooperatively to study the effects of 
chemical contaminants on marine organisms at 
several sites in Vancouver Harbour, British 
Columbia. 
 
As part of this workshop, the Northwest Fisheries 
Science Center examined the relationship between 
liver lesions and chemical contaminant exposure 
in English sole (Parophrys vetulus).  English sole 
is a benthic flatfish used extensively as a sentinel 
species for contaminant effects in North American 
west coast marine environments.  English sole live 
in close association with bottom sediments, 
preying on clams, worms and other benthic 
invertebrates.  This species of fish lives in 
nearshore environments that are often affected by 
urban activities, and are therefore at high risk of 
being exposed to chemical contaminants.  
 
Fish were collected with a bottom trawl from a

Vancouver Lab), and three industrial sites 
(Lonsdale Quay, Indian Arm and Port Moody) 
within Vancouver Harbour (Fig. 1).  Samples of 
fish liver, fish bile and sediment were collected, 
preserved, and returned to the laboratory for 
analyses.  Liver and bile were collected from 30 
fish at each site.  A portion of the liver was 
preserved in Dietrichs fixative for histopathology.  
Paraffin sections were prepared and examined 
microscopically for non-infectious, toxicopathic 
lesions.  Liver was also collected for chlorinated 
hydrocarbon analyses.  Three composites of liver 
were analyzed.  Each composite contained equal 
weights of liver from five fish.  Bile from 10 
individual fish was analyzed at each sampling site.  
Bile was analyzed for metabolites of aromatic 
hydrocarbons using HPLC as described by Krahn 
 
26
 
 
et al. (1986).  A Van Veen grab was used to 
collect sediment from each site.  
 
After fishing operations were completed, the 
center of the trawl area was determined, the 
anchor was deployed to maintain position, and 
three grabs of sediment were taken from this area.  
At sites where no trawling was done, the site 
location was established by the location of the 
sediment sample.  An equal amount of sediment 
from each grab was combined to form a sample 
for each site and analyzed for aromatic 
hydrocarbons (AHs) and chlorinated hydrocarbons 
(CHs).  Sediment AHs and CHs, and liver CHs 
were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass 
spectroscopy as described by Sloan et al. (1993). 
 
Sediment concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons 
were higher at the three industrialized sites in 
Vancouver Harbour (Fig. 2).  Chlorinated 
hydrocarbons were higher at Indian Arm and Port 
Moody, the two industrial sites located farthest 
inside the Harbour (Fig. 2).  Concentrations of

Histopathology of English sole liver was examined 
as a biological marker of contaminant effects.  
Fish were examined for toxicopathic liver lesions 
including proliferative disorders (such as hepato-
cellular regeneration and cholangiofibrosis), 
specific degeneration/necrosis (including 
megalocytic hepatosis and hepatocellular nuclear 
pleomorphism), preneoplastic conditions 
(including eosinophilic, basophilic and clear cell 
foci), and neoplasms (including adenomas and 
carcinomas).  Toxicopathic liver lesions were 
observed in 20 to 23% of the fish at each of the 
three industrial sites, while no lesions were 
observed at either of the reference sites (Fig. 5).

Fish age data were provided by Colin Levings and 
colleagues at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in 
West Vancouver.  Otoliths collected from English 
sole were aged as part of their fish community 
study that was conducted during the Practical 
Workshop.  The average age of fish was 6 to  
7 years at all sites except at Port Moody, where the 
average age was 9 years.  Analysis of variance 
indicated that the mean age of English sole at Port 
Moody were significantly older than at other sites.  
It is important to account for fish age when 
evaluating prevalences of liver lesions, because 
the risk of developing these lesions increases with 
age (Rhodes et al. 1987).  Therefore, the high 
prevalence of toxicopathic liver lesions in English 
sole from Port Moody may be occurring in part 
because these fish are older than those at the other 
sites.  In other words, the prevalence of liver 
lesions at Port Moody would probably be 
somewhat less than 23% if only fish of 
comparable age were compared with the other 
Vancouver Harbour sites.  
 
Spearman-Rank correlations showed that the 
prevalence of toxicopathic liver lesions was 
significantly associated with low and high 
molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons in 
sediment, and with aromatic compounds 
fluorescing at Benzo[a]pyrene wavelengths 
measured in the bile.  This is consistent with the 
hepatocarcinogenicity and hepatotoxicity of high 
molecular weight polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons that has been observed in fish, 
including English sole, from other contaminated 
sites along the northeastern Pacific coast.

Introduction 
 
The processes for intake of the contaminants by 
aquatic animals are roughly classified.  One is 
bioconcentration or the intake of dissolved 
chemicals in water through the gills, and the other 
is biomagnification through the food web (Herbert 
1986).  In general, most of the lipophilic 
compounds such as PCBs and DDTs are 
accumulated due to biomagnification.  Therefore, 
these chemicals are accumulated at much higher 
concentrations in the upper trophic level of the 
30
 
food chain (Bentzen et al. 1996; Campfens and 
Mackay 1997; Morrison et al. 1997).  The 
lipophilic contaminants could cause negative 
effects on reproduction and individual health.  As 
a result of regulations by the governments of 
advanced countries, use of some persistent organo-
chlorine chemicals has declined, and their residual 
levels in the environment have been decreasing.  
But these organochlorine chemicals have been 
detected in wildlife, and contamination has 
continued at low levels.  Benthic fish have been 
good indicators of coastal pollution in the water 
column and sediments, although the bioaccumu-
lation patterns of the different chemicals varied 
substantially among species (Pastor et al. 1996). 
 
Usually, soxhlet and ultrasonic extraction methods 
are used for the extractions of PCBs and 
polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from 
biological samples.  These are fine methods, but 
they are time consuming and also need 
complicated preparation, such as hydrolysis of 
lipids by saponification.  In addition, many 
pesticides are broken down during saponification. 
 
Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is performed 
with carbon dioxide at temperatures and pressures 
above critical point.  T he SFE extraction is 
completed in a shorter time compared to the usual 
method, and it is possible to simultaneously 
perform the rough clean-up using alumina and 
silica.  Therefore sample preparation such as the 
removal of the lipids is expected to be simplified.  
In addition, SFE is able to extract PCBs, PAHs and 
organochlorine pesticides simultaneously.  
Although the application of SFE is increasing for 
real environmental samples, presently there are 
only few reports that have examined biological 
samples from the field (Chester et al. 1998).    
 
The PICES Practical Workshop was held from 
May 24 to June 7, 1999, in Vancouver Harbour, 
Canada.  In this study, English sole, (Pleuronectes 
vetulus), which occupies the upper trophic level in 
the food chain, were collected from 5 sites within 
Vancouver Harbour (sampling sites are shown in 
Section I, Fig. 1.4).  English sole tissues were 
analyzed to determine concentrations of PCBs, 
organochlorine pesticides and PAHs.  SFE was 
used to extract the contaminants. 
 
Methods 
 
English sole were collected at 5 sites within 
Vancouver Harbour.  Fish were immediately 
dissected on the ship, and tissues were frozen.  
Before analysis, the tissue samples were 
homogenized, and freeze-dried for 24 - 48 hours.  
The freeze-dried samples were cut into pieces with 
scissors.  
 
PCBs, PAHs, and organochlorine pesticides in the 
organs were extracted by SFE using carbon 
dioxide and a 1% modifier of m ethanol.  The 
temperature and pressure of SFE were 50  C and 
214 bar, respectively (carbon dioxide density,  
0.80 g/ml).  Before the extraction, the supercritical 
carbon dioxide was equilibrated in the sample for 
10 min, and the extractions were performed f or  
40 min.  The flow rate of supercritical carbon 
dioxide was 3.0 ml/min.  Each sample was put into 
a stainless steel tube, and 1 g-alumina was packed 
on the sample.  The extracts w ere adsorbed to a 
florisil trap which was kept at 65  C.  After the 
extraction, the extracts were eluted first with 3 ml 
hexane and then with 3 ml acetone.  The elutions 
were combined, the solvent was exchanged to 
hexane completely, and the hexane solution was 
concentrated to 1 ml under a nitrogen stream.  The 
concentrated extract was loaded on a florisil 
column (packed in a Pasteur pipette), washed with 
5 m l hexane, eluted with 10 m l hexane, and then 
with 10 m l - 5% diethyl ether – hexane.  Each 
eluent was concentrated to 0.1 ml under a nitrogen 
stream and quantified by GC/MS.  The analytical 
assurances were certified by standard reference 
material 2974 (organics in freeze-dried mussel 
tissue (Mytilus edulis) of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology. 
 
Results and discussion 
 
PCBs 
 
Figure 1 shows total PCBs ( SPCBs) in organs.  
The concentration distributions were different for 
muscle, ovaries, testes, and liver among each 
sampling point.  The total PCB concentrations in 
liver w ere remarkably high, about 3 - 670 times 
higher compared to other organs, at all sampling 
sites.  Total PCBs were detected at relatively high 
levels in organs at sites T-11B, T -38, and T -48. 
31
 
The ratios of the concentrations were different 
among the sampling sites, but t he order of the 
concentration was liver > testis > ovarian > 
muscle.   
 
Seventy PCB congeners were measured.  The 
ratios of distribution for individual PCB congeners 
in organs were similar.  As an example, at site  
T-11B, the concentration of PCB 153 was highest 
for all organs ( muscle:  0.96 ng/g, ovaries:  1.08 
ng/g, testes:  8.92 ng/g, and liver:  27.65 ng/g  
(Fig. 2)).  In addition, the concentrations of PCB 
138, 187, 180, 110, and 99 were high in organs.  
Although fewer congeners were detected in testes 
than in other organs, the individual concentrations 
were higher than in muscle and ovary.  The 
concentrations of individual congeners in muscle 
and ovaries were similar, but these concentrations 
were 1/20 - 1/400 of that in liver. 
 
PAHs 
 
The concentrations of naphthalene, and 1 - and  
2-methylnaphthalene were relatively high in all 
organs.  But these chemicals are easily introduced 
as contaminants during the extraction process, 
therefore these quantities could be overestimated.  
In this investigation, because only a small amount 
of testes were gathered at all sampling sites, 
naphthalene and methylnaphalene could influence 
the concentration of total PAHs (SPAHs).  Except 
for naphthalene, the concentrations of SPAHs in 
testes and liver were roughly similar at each site. 
In addition, PAH concentrations in testes and liver 
were higher than in muscle and ovaries, although 
the differences were smaller than those found in 
the case of PCBs.  Concentrations of PAHs were 
lower and less variable among organs than PCBs.  
This suggested that PAHs were metabolized 
considerably more than PCBs (Krahn et al. 1993) 
and the parent compounds of PAHs showed less 
bioaccumulation in lipids than PCBs.  The highest 
concentration of total PAHs in organs was 
detected at site T-11B.  Concentrations of PAH at 
sites T-50, T -49, T -38, and T -48 were similar, 
with a slightly higher concentration at site T-50. 
 
Of the individual PAHs measured in fish tissues at 
the sampling sites (Fig. 3.), phenanthrene was 
found at the highest concentrations.  Furthermore,

fluoranthene were slightly elevated.  In the mussel 
investigation portion of the Vancouver Harbour 
Practical Workshop (see Mussel report, this 
publication), mussels ( Mytlilus trossulus) were 
collected from intertidal sites within Vancouver 
Harbour and whole body tissue was analyzed for 
PAHs.  The distribution pattern of PAH concen-
trations in mussels were different from that of fish.  
Namely, fluoranthene concentrations were higher 
in mussel than phenanthrene, and concentrations 
of phenanthrene and pyrene were similar.  In 
addition, dibenzothiophene concentrations were 
only a small proportion of total PAHs in mussels.  
These differences may be caused by dissimilar 
methods of PAH uptake by English sole and 
mussels. 
 
Organochlorine pesticides 
 
The primary organochlorine pesticides detected in 
English sole were DDTs (p,p’- and o,p’ -) and its 
metabolites ( p,p’-, and o,p’-DDDs and DDEs). 
Other pesticides were found at considerably lower 
levels.  The concentrations of DDTs and its 
metabolites were highest in l iver, and second 
highest in ovaries.  Concentrations of DDTs and 
its metabolites were higher in liver of fish from 
sites T-49, T -11B and T -38 (33.36 ng/g,  
66.28 ng/g, and 44.36 ng/g, respectively) 
compared to other organs (Fig. 4).  Relatively low 
concentrations of DDTs were detected in testes, 
even though PCB and PAH concentrations were 
high. 
 
The concentration of DDE was higher than DDT 
and DDD for all organs.  Concentrations of DDT 
metabolites accounted for 40 - 90% of total DDTs 
(Fig. 5).  Concentrations of DDT metabolites in 
muscle, testis and liver accounted for more than 
80% of total DDTs.  However, at all sites, DDT 
concentrations in ovaries were higher than in other 
organs, and ovaries accumulated parent DDTs at 
much higher concentrations compared to other 
organs.  The concentration of o,p’-DDT was lower 
in all organs, and it was detected much less 
frequently than p,p’-DDT.

Conclusion 
 
In this study, the contaminant concentrations in 
muscle, ovaries, testes, and liver of English sole 
were investigated at Vancouver Harbour, Canada, 
during the PICES Practical Workshop.  The 
concentrations of PAHs in testes and liver were 
higher than in muscle and ovaries.  The highest 
concentration of SPAHs in organs was detected at 
site T-11B.  Concentrations of PAHs in tissue of 
English sole from sites T-50, T -49, T -38, and  
T-48, were similar to each other.  Of the individual 
PAHs measured, phenanthrene was found at the 
highest concentrations in all tissues.  Pyrene, 
dibenzothiphene, and fluoranthene were also 
found at detectable levels.

The concentrations of DDT and its metabolites 
were highest in liver and second highest in 
ovaries.  The concentrations of DDT and its 
metabolites in liver were relatively high in fish 
from sites T-49, T -11B and T -38.  The 
concentration of DDE was higher in all organs 
compared to DDT and DDD.  DDT metabolites 
accounted for 40–90% of total DDT 
concentrations.  However, DDT concentration in 
ovaries of fish from all sites were higher than in 
other organs, and ovaries accumulated DDT parent 
compounds at much higher levels than other 
organs.

Introduction 
 
Since bivalves have a wide distribution, extensive 
populations, filtering habits, and ability to 
accumulate organic contaminants, analysis of 
chemicals in the soft tissue of bivalves is useful as 
an index of contamination in the aquatic 
environment.  In general, invertebrates have low 
35
  
metabolic abilities and the contaminants are 
accumulated and remain in them for a longer 
period than in vertebrates.  This is especially true 
for the lipophilic compounds such as 
organochlorine contaminants (e.g. PCBs and 
DDT), and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 
(Connell 1995).  These contaminants could cause 
negative effects for reproduction and individual 
health.  As a result of regulations for the use of 
some persistent organochlorine chemicals by the 
governments of advanced countries, residual levels 
of these chemicals in the environment have 
declined.  But organochlorine chemicals have been 
detected in wildlife, and contamination has still 
continued at low levels.  Therefore, bivalves have 
been used by a number of investigators to study 
the contamination of wildlife (Tanabe et al. 1987, 
Colombo et al. 1995, Hofelt and Shea 1997). 
 
Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is performed 
with carbon dioxide under temperatures and 
pressures above a critical point.  The SFE 
extraction can be completed in a shorter time 
compared to the usual method, and it is possible to 
simultaneously perform the rough clean-up using 
alumina and silica.  Therefore sample preparation 
for GC/MS and HPLC can be simplified.  In 
addition, SFE is able to simultaneously extract 
PCBs, PAHs and organochlorine pesticides from 
biological samples.  In this decade, the application 
of SFE is increasing for real environmental 
samples.  However, only few studies of biological 
samples from the field have been reported so far 
(Chester et al. 1998). 
 
The PICES Practical Workshop was held from 
May 24 to June 7, 1999, in Vancouver Harbour, 
Canada.  In this study, the contamination levels of 
PCBs, organochlorine pesticides, and PAHs in 
mussel, Mytilus trossulus, were investigated at 
West Vancouver Harbour, Canada.  Furthermore, 
6 species of bivalves were also sampled at a few 
sampling sites where mussels were collected.  
Chemical concentrations were also determined in 
these bivalves and the inter-species differences 
were examined. 
 
Methods 
 
Mussels were gathered at 9 sampling sites in 
Vancouver Harbour ( these I-sites are shown in 
Fig. 1).  Before analyses, the soft tissue of bivalve 
samples were shelled, homogenized, frozen at  
–20°C for a day, and then freeze-dried for 24 - 48 
hours.  The freeze-dried samples were broken to 
pieces with scissors. 
 
PCBs, PAHs, and organochlorine pesticides in the 
bivalves were extracted by SFE using carbon 
dioxide with a 1% modifier of methanol.  The 
temperature and pressure of SFE were 50°C and 
214 bar, respectively (carbon dioxide density,  
0.80 g/ml).  Before the extraction, the supercritical 
carbon dioxide was equilibrated in the sample for 
10 minutes, and the extractions were performed 
for 40 minutes.  The flow rate of supercritical 
carbon dioxide was 3.0 ml/min.  The sample was 
put into the stainless steel tube, and 1 g alumina 
was packed on the sample.  The extracts were 
adsorbed to a florisil trap which was kept at 
650°C.  After the extraction, the extracts were 
eluted first with 3 ml hexane, and then with 3 ml 
acetone.  The elutions were combined, the solvent

was exchanged to hexane completely, and the 
hexane solution was concentrated to 1 ml under a 
nitrogen stream.  The concentrated extract was 
loaded on a florisil column (packed in a Pasteur 
pipette), washed with 5 m l hexane, eluted with  
10 m l hexane, and then with 10 m l 5% diethyl 
ether–hexane.  Each elutant was concentrated to 
0.1 m l under nitrogen stream and quantified by 
GC/MS.  The analytical assurances were certified 
by standard reference material 2974 (organics in 
freeze-dried mussel, Mytilus edulis, tissue) of the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology. 
 
Result and discussion 
 
PCBs in mussels 
 
The concentrations of total PCBs ( SPCBs) 
detected in mussels at each sampling site were 
classified roughly into 3 groups, namely, a first 
group with SPCB concentration of about 5 ng/g or 
more (sites I -3A, I -4, and I -6), a second group 
with SPCB concentration of about 2 ng/g (sites  
I-3B and I-3C), and a third group with SPCB 
concentration of about 1 ng/g or below (sites I-1, 
I-2, I-5B and I-7) (Fig. 2).   
 
At the site I -5, the concentration of SPCBs was 
much lower than at the other sampling sites, and 
low molecular weight congeners (with less than 4 
chlorines) made up the highest percentage of total

PCBs.  At the other sampling sites, 70 – 87% of 
total PCBs were made up of higher molecular 
weight congeners with over 5 chlorines.  The 
dominant group of PCB congeners had 6 
chlorines, and these accounted for 33 to 55% of 
total PCBs.  The proportions of congeners with 6 
and 7 chlorines were relatively higher at sites I-2, 
I-3A and I-3B (63%, 70% and 64%, respectively) 
than at other sampling sites (40 - 57 %). 
 
For the individual PCB congeners in mussel, PCB 
153 and 138 occurred at much higher concen-
trations than the other congeners.  Furthermore, 
the concentrations of PCB 74, 110, and 187 were 
also relatively high.  The ratios of these five 
congeners in SPCBs were over 50% at all 
sampling sites, except for site I-5B (45%) (Fig. 3). 
 
Organochlorine pesticides in mussels 
 
In this investigation, there was no common pattern 
in the distribution of organochlorine pesticides 
among the sampling sites (Fig. 4).  At almost all 
sampling sites, the concentrations for a-, b-, and g-
HCHs were higher than those of other 
organochlorine pesticides.  Levels of g-HCH 
similar to the other HCHs were detected at all 
sampling sites, although the most common 
37
  
isomers generally found in the environment are a-, 
b- and g- (Walker. et al. 1999). The concentrations 
of a-HCH at sites I-1 and I-2 were relatively high 
(1.5 ng/g and 1.3 ng/g, respectively), although the 
concentrations of SPCBs at both sites were low.  
The distribution patterns and the concentrations of 
b- and g-HCH were similar among all sampling 
sites.  In particular, these concentrations were 
highest at site I -3C (3.2 ng/g for b-HCH and  
3.4 ng/g for g -HCH, respectively) among all 
sampling sites, although the concentrations of 
SPCBs were not so high at this site.  On the other 
hand, although concentrations of SPCBs were 
highest at site I -4, concentrations of b- and g -
HCH were low (0.75 and 0.84 ng/g, respectively).  
 
The highest concentrations of p,p’-DDT and its 
metabolites were detected at site I -4, except for 
DDD.  The concentration of p,p’-DDD was 
remarkably high (7.7 ng/g).  The distribution 
patterns for p,p’- DDT and metabolites were 
similar, if DDD at I-3C is excluded. 
 
For h eptachlor, it is remarkable that the 
concentrations were relatively high at sites I -1,  
I-5B, and I-7, where PCBs levels were low. 
 
PAH in mussels 
The maximum concentration of total PAHs  
(252 ng/g) was detected at site I -4 and the 
minimum was 53 ng/g at site I-5B.  Fluoranthene 
was detected at highest concentrations at all 
sampling sites, and those concentrations were 5 - 
81 ng/g.  Furthermore, the concentrations of 
phenanthrene, chrysene, and pyrene were 
relatively high:  more than 50% of total PAHs at 
all sites except for I-5B (Fig. 5). 
 
The b enzo[a]pyrene concentration was about  
0.2 ng/g at all sampling sites.  The concentrations 
of naphthalene, 1 - and 2 -methylnaphthalene, 
biphenyl, fluorene, and acenaphthene (group 1) 
were similar, and about 1–10 ng/g, at all sampling 
sites.  On the other hand, the concentrations of 
phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, 
chrysene, and 1,2-benzoanthracene (group 2) were 
different among the sites (Fig 6).  However, the 
same compounds were found at all sites, and 
tended to co-occur with PCBs, although the 
concentrations of each PAH were quite different.  
These distributional similarities between PAHs of 
group 2 and PCBs could exist because PAHs were 
adsorbed through the food web.  Broman et al. 
(1990) did not find biomagnification of PAHs 
from food in a natural Baltic Sea food chain.  But 
for group 2 all octanol/water coefficients (in 
logarifmic scale, lgK
OW
) were above 4 (4.46 for 
phenanthrene, 4.45 for anthracene, 5.16 for 
fluoranthene, 4.88 for pyrene, 5.73 for chrysene, 
and 5.79 for 1,2-benzanthracene (Hansch et al. 
1995).  Spacie et al. (1982) estimated that

the uptake of chemicals with lgK
ow
 > 5 through the 
gill membrane declines gradually.  Therefore, a 
large amount of PAHs in group 2 mussels could be 
taken up through the food web, although lgK
ow
 for 
phenanthrene and anthracene is small. 
 
Differences between species 
 
Differences of contaminant concentrations were 
observed between mussel and other species.  As an 
example, at site I-4, the concentrations of SPCBs 
in Pacific littleneck ( Protothaca staminea), 
Nuttall’s cockle ( Clinocardium nuttallii), and 
Butter clam ( Saxidomus gigantea) were higher 
than that in mussel.  On the other hand, the 
concentrations of PAHs in these three species of 
bivalves were lower than that in mussel.  There 
was no consistent pattern in organochlorine 
pesticide concentrations among the four species of 
bivalves. 
 
In this investigation, the concentrations of 
contaminants in Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) 
were much higher than in other bivalves.  For 
example, the concentration of total PCBs was  
30 ng/g in Pacific oyster at site I -6, and that was 
about 6 times higher than in mussel (4.8 ng/g) 
from the same site.  The concentration of total 
PAHs in oyster was also about two times higher 
than that in mussel at this site.  Furthermore, all 
organochlorine pesticides were detected at higher 
levels in oysters than in mussels (Fig. 7).  Results 
show that Pacific oyster could accumulate more 
contaminants than mussel. 
 
Conclusions 
 
In this study, the contaminants in mussels and 
other bivalves were investigated at Vancouver 
Harbour, Canada, during the PICES Practical 
Workshop.  The highest concentrations of PCBs 
and PAHs were detected at site I -4 near Cates 
Park.  The distributional patterns of organo-
chlorine pesticide concentrations were individually 
different.  The main congeners of PCBs were 
IUPAC No. 153, 138, 74, 110, and 187, those of 
PAHs were phenanthrene, chrysene, and pyrene, 
and those of organochlorine pesticides were a-, b-, 
and g-HCHs.

The intakes of phenanthrene, anthracene, 
fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene, and 1,2-benzo-
anthracene could be through the food web.  Since 
the patterns of distribution among sampling sites 
were similar with that of SPCBs, most of these 
contaminants were thought to be absorbed from 
food. 
 
In general, since most of the PCBs and 
organochlorine pesticides in aquatic animals are 
accumulated through the food web, these 
concentrations could be variable seasonally with 
the dietary quantity (Hühnerfuss et al. 1995).  
Therefore, it i s necessary to conduct a few 
investigations at the same sites for a year to 
understand these pollution levels.

Introduction 
 
Lipids are divided broadly into two categories:  
namely, neutral lipid (NL), which is the stored fat 
and is mainly composed of triglycerides, and 
phospholipids (PL) and cholesterol, which are 
building blocks of membranes.  Identification of 
lipid composition is important for physiological 
studies.  Furthermore, PCBs and other oragano-
chlorine contaminants are known to accumulate in 
tissue, and the information for lipid composition is 
helpful to explain the mechanism for the 
accumulation of these chemicals.  
 
Fatty acids are the principal components in lipids.  
Their diversity in terms of chain length, degree of 
unsaturation, geometry, and position of the double 
bonds is responsible for the definitive 
characteristics of lipids for different organisms 
(Gutnikov 1995).  
 
The Iatroscan TLC method was used to separate 
lipids by thin layer chromatography using the 
hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID).  This 
method was developed by Okumura et al. (1975).  
The next step was done with an adsorbent sintered 
thin layer chromatographic quartz rod that 
consisted of silica gel powder fused by fine glass 
powder as the binding agent and an automatic 
scanner, which contains a hydrogen-FID for 
sample detection.  The combination of these two 
steps makes quantitative TLC a rapid and easy 
method for the routine analysis of lipids separated 
by regular TLC.  
 
The PICES Practical Workshop was held from 
May 24 to June 7, 1999, in Vancouver Harbour, 
Canada.  In this study, the lipid and fatty acid 
composition of mussel, Mytilus trossulus, were 
determined at 7 sites (I-1, I-2, I-3A, I-4, I-5B, I-6, 
and I-7) in Vancouver Harbour (Fig. 1). 
 
Methods 
 
One hundred mussels of various sizes were 
gathered at each site.  Mussels were shelled, and 
soft tissues were homogenized.  L ipids were 
extracted from 5 g subsamples using a 30 m l 
solvent mixture of chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v) 
(Blig and Dyer 1959).  The chloroform layer, 
(which contains dissolved lipids) was collected, 
washed with 0.88% potassium chloride, and 
removed completely using a rotary-evaporator and 
a centrifugal-evaporator.  Then, the concentration 
of lipids was adjusted to 100 mg/ml with 
chloroform.  The separation of NL and PL was 
performed using a Sep-pak Silica washed with  
10 m l chloroform.  50 ml of chloroform with 
extracted lipids was then loaded onto the Sep-pak.  
The NL was eluted with 8 ml chloroform, and the 
PL was eluted with 10 ml methanol.  
 
For the determination of the lipidic composition, 
0.2 ml of chloroform containing the extracted 
lipids w as spotted onto the base of Chromarods, 
and developed with hexane-diethylether-acetic 
acid (70:30:1).  After the solution was developed 
to a certain position, Chromarods were dried at 
100ºC, and lipids were analyzed by an Iatroscan.  
Fatty acids in NL and PL were analyzed according 
to the methods of the American Oil Chemists’ 
Society (A.O.C.S.) (1991).  The extracted lipids 
were removed using nitrogen gas and a centrifugal 
evaporator, and saponificated with 0.5 N sodium 
hydroxide at 100ºC for 5 minutes.  Then, the 
saponificated samples were methylated by 14% 
43
  
boron trifloride methanol complex methanol 
solution at 100ºC for 30 minutes.  After the 
methylation, fatty acids were dissolved in 
Isooctane, and analyzed by GC/MS.

Results and discussion 
 
Lipid composition in mussels 
 
Results of analysis by the Iatroscan TLC showed 
that the main lipids in mussels were triglyceride 
(TG), free fatty acid (FFA), sterol (ST), and 
phospholipid (PL).  The ratios of these compounds 
to total lipid were 10 - 23% for TG, 24 - 37% for 
FFA, 4 - 7% for ST, and 36 - 55% for PL (Fig. 2).  
Furthermore, we analyzed PL using a thin layer 
chromatograph (TLC) and the Iatroscan TLC.  
TLC results showed that phospholipid was 
composed of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), 
ceramide 2 -aminoethyl phosphate (CAEP), 
phosphatidylserine (PS), lysophosphatidyl-

ethanolamine (LPE), phosphat-idylcholine (PC), 
lysophosphatidyl-choline (LPC), and others.  The 
individual quantities of CAEP, PS, and LPE could 
not be determined, because they were not 
separated completely.  The ratios of compositions 
in the PL were 27 - 37% for PE, 28 - 55% for 
CAEP+PS+LPE, 11 - 25% for LPC.  All components 
of total lipids are shown in Figure 2.  
 
The depot lipid is mainly TG and the lipid 
composition changes depending on the nutrient 
condition.  On the other hand, the tissue lipid is 
mainly PL and its composition does not change.  
On the basis of these lipidic characteristics, we 
tried to evaluate the nutrient conditions of mussels 
at all sampling sites using the TG/PL ratio (Fig. 3).  
The ratio was highest at site I-7 and the nutrient 
condition of mussels at this site appeared to be 
better than at other sites.

It is well known that the oxidation and hydrolysis 
of lipids in fish and shellfish during frozen storage 
cause serious deterioration of quality (e.g. Jeong, 
et al. 1990; Shimada and Ogura 1990; Refsgaard 
et al. 1998).  Jeong et al. (1990) reported that the 
contents of TG and PC in oyster, Crassostrea 
gigas, decreased during storage at –20°C while the 
concentration of free fatty acids increased.  In this 
study, the mussel samples were stored at –20°C 
until analysis.  Samples were transported from 
Canada to Japan on dry ice.  Under these 
circumstances, in our analysis the content of FFA 
in total lipid could be higher, and content of TG 
and PC could be lower, than those in live animals.  
But all samples were kept in the same condition 
until analysis so that the nutrient condition among 
the sampling sites might be compared from the 
TG/PL ratio. 
 
Ota et al. (1990) reported that TG was the main 
component of total lipid (TL) in rainbow trout 
(91.3%) and other fishes.  According to Ozawa et 
al. (1993), the TG content in TL of kokanee 
salmon’s muscle was 65.3% for the dorsal portion, 
82.8% for the ventral portion, and 66.7% for the 
tail.  Kawasaki et al. (1994) also reported that the 
TG content in TL in firefly squid’s liver was 60.9 - 
72.4%.  Since the quantity of TG changes 
considerably with the season, the comparison 
between mussel and other aquatic animals is 
difficult.  But the TG concentration in mussel was 
lower than that in fish and squid.  
 
Fatty acid composition 
 
The fatty acid composition was identified for 41 
classes by GC/MS.  Table 1 shows the fatty acid 
composition in lipids for those classes that were 
more than 1% of the total fatty acids.  The 
dominant components of total fatty acids were 
16:0, 16:1n-7, 18:1n-7, 20:5n-3, and 22:6n-3.  The 
composition of fatty acids in NL was 41 classes, 
while that in the PL was 29 classes.  Especially, 
20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 contained higher levels of 
fatty acids and they were 8.8 - 18.8% and 6.4 - 
14.5%, respectively.  The compositions of 20:4, 
20:5, 22:5, and 22:6 are special for aquatic 
organisms (Koike and Tsuchiya 1988), and these 
ratios were 20 - 33% in total fatty acids. 
 
Similar levels of 14:0, 16:0, 16:2n-7, 18:0, and 
20:5n-3 were found in NL and PL.  The contents 
of 17:0, 18:1n-9, 18:1n-7, 18:3n-3, 18:4n-3, and 
20:2n-6 w ere higher in NL than those in the PL.  
On the other hand, the contents of 16:1n-7,  
20:5n-3, 22:1n-11, and 22:6n-3 were higher in PL 
than in NL. 
 
Jeng et al. (1990) reported that the percentages of 
polyenoic acid in PL, NL, and TL for C. gigas 
decreased and the percentage of saturated acids 
increased during storage at –20°C.  In this study, 
unsaturated fatty acids could be underestimated in 
comparison with lipid compositions found in live 
animals. 
 
Conclusion 
 
In this study, the lipid and fatty acid composition 
in mussel, M. trossulus, w as determined at 
Vancouver Harbour, Canada, during the PICES 
Practical Workshop.  The main components of 
lipid were tryglyceride, free fatty acid, sterol, and 
phospholipids, which w ere composed of 
phosphatidylethanolamine, ceramide 2 -amino-
ethylphosphonate, phosphatidylserine, lyphosphat-
idylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and 
lysosphatidylcholine.  The ratio of triglyceride in 
total lipid was lower than that in fish.  
 
The dominant components of total fatty acids were 
16:0, 16:1n-7, 18:1n-7, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3.  The 
composition of fatty acids in neutral lipid and 
phospholipid was identified for 41 and 29 classes, 
respectively.  
 
Generally, the fatty acid composition is influenced 
by feeding, season, water temperature, and depth 
of the habitat (Hori and Itasaka 1978).  In the 
future, if the plant and animal plankton of food for 
mussels can be gathered at the sampling sites, the 
dietary life could be estimated from the fatty acid 
composition.   
 
The fatty acid and lipid composition might have 
deteriorated during transportation from Canada to 
Japan, and during storage until analysis.  If more 
accurate quantitative analysis is needed, lipid 
determinations will have to be performed as soon 
as the samples have been gathered.

Introduction 
 
Vancouver Harbour is a busy seaport and gets a 
considerable influx of anthropogenic pollutants 
including metals, PCBs, organochlorine pesticides, 
and polyaromatic hydrocarbons.  English sole 
(Pleuronectes vetulus) are bottom-feeding fish and 
subject to bioaccumulation of lipophilic 
hydrocarbon compounds, which contaminate the 
sediments in the harbour and are linked to toxicity 
in various marine organisms.  English sole is an 
excellent sentinel species for monitoring marine 
ecosystem health because they are relatively slow 
growing, are widely distributed throughout the 
harbour and adjacent waters, and individual fish 
have a small home range or forage in a relatively 
confined area.  In addition, English sole is a 
potential source of human contaminant exposure 
because it is fished commercially. 
 
Induction of hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 
(CYP) enzymes is a common and characteristic 
biochemical response to halogenated hydrocarbon 
exposure that accompanies and often precedes 
toxicity in all animals examined thus far.  CYP is a 
large and ubiquitous group of hemeproteins found 
in fish, mammals, birds, plants, and 
microorganisms that catalyze the oxidative 
biotransformation of diverse lipophilic xenobiotic 
and endogenous compounds.  Because CYP 
47
 
 
enzymes play a critical role in the metabolism, 
bioaccumulation, and potential toxicity of 
halogenated and nonhalogenated hydrocarbons 
found in the food chain, levels of individual CYP 
enzymes are important d eterminants of 
susceptibility to environmental contaminant 
exposure.  CYP enzyme induction in fish 
populations has been suggested as a sensitive 
biochemical marker of contaminant exposure, and 
by inference, of marine ecosystem health (Safe 
1990; Goksøyr and Förlin 1992; Stegeman et al. 
1992; Addison 1996; Addison et al. 1994; 
Campbell et al. 1996).  Induction of the CYP1A 
subfamily of enzymes can be determined by 
measurement of associated enzymes activities 
such as ethoxyreosufin O-deethylase (EROD) and 
benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase or by measuring 
CYP1A protein using immunochemical methods. 
 
The purpose of the present study was to measure 
EROD activity and CYP1A protein levels in liver 
tissue of English sole from five sites in and around 
Vancouver Harbour, and to compare these 
biochemical parameters with sediment levels of 
hydrocarbon pollutants measured at these same 
sites. 
 
Materials and methods 
 
Liver samples  
 
English sole were collected by trawl net during 
May and June 1999, from five sites in and around 
Vancouver Harbour.  The sites were designated as 
T-50 (Howe Sound), T -49 (West Vancouver),  
T-11B (Lonsdale Quay), T-38 (Port Moody), and 
T-48 (Indian Arm) (see Section I, Fig. 1.4).  Thirty 
fish were collected from each site.  Fish were 
weighed, separated by sex, and a blood sample 
was taken.  Fish were then killed by dissection of 
the spinal cord, and livers were removed and 
placed into ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4.  
Hepatic microsomes were prepared from 68 male 
and female fish (at least 10 fish per site), by 
differential centrifugation.  Microsomal pellets 
were suspended in 0.25 M sucrose and aliquots of 
the suspension were stored at –75  C until used. 
 
Twenty additional English sole were collected 
from site T -49 for use as positive and negative 
controls for the microsomal CYP assays in a 
controlled exposure experiment.  These fish were 
housed in salt-water aquaria at a temperature of 
8 C in the West Vancouver Facility.  After 
acclimation for 5 days, the fish were weighed and 
10 fish in one aquarium tank were treated with b-
naphthoflavone (b-NF) in corn oil by a single i.p 
injection at a dosage of 50 mg/kg.  Ten fish in a 
second tank were treated similarly with corn oil 
(vehicle) only at a dosage of 0.25 ml/100 g body 
weight.  One week after treatment, the fish were 
killed by dissection of the spinal cord, weighed, 
and liver microsomes were prepared as described 
above. 
 
Determination of cytochrome P450 and protein 
 
Total CYP content was determined from the 
carbon monoxide difference spectrum using the 
method of Omura and Sato (1964).  Protein 
concentration was measured by the method of 
Lowry et al. (1981). 
 
Enzyme assays 
 
Microsomal EROD activity was measured using a 
spectrofluorometric assay as described by Burke et 
al.(1985).  Each microsomal sample was assayed 
directly in a fluorescence cuvette incubated at 
room temperature (22–25 C) using a Shimadzu 
Model RF-540 fluorometer interfaced with a 
Shimadzu DR-3 data recorder. 
 
Preparation of antibodies 
 
Antibody against CYP1A was raised in female 
New Zealand rabbits immunized with a synthetic 
peptide corresponding to trout CYP1A coupled to 
keyhole limpet hemocyanin as described 
previously (Lin et al. 1998).  This antibody is 
specific for mammalian CYP1A1 and recognizes a 
single CYP1A protein in all fish species tested to 
date. 
 
Immunoblots and densitometric quantitation  
 
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was 
performed essentially as described by Laemmli 
(1970).  English sole liver microsomal samples 
were applied to gels at a final concentration of 
either 2 or 5 pmol total microsomal CYP per lane.  
Microsomal proteins resolved on SDS-PAGE were 
48
 
 
transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose 
and probed with antibodies as described by 
Towbin et al. (1979).  Blots were incubated with 
anti-cytochrome P450 1 A peptide IgG at a 
concentration of 10 mg IgG/ml.  Bound primary 
antibody was located using alkaline phosphatase-
conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary 
antibody.  Immunoreactive proteins were detected 
by reaction with a substrate solution containing 
0.01% NBT, 0.05% BCIP, and 0.5 mM MgCl
2
 in 
0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.5.  Assay conditions 
were optimized to ensure that colour development 
did not proceed beyond the linear response range 
of the phosphatase reaction.  Staining intensities of 
the bands were quantified with a pdi 420 oe 
scanning densitometer connected to an IBM-type 
personal computer using Quantity One  Version 
3.0 software (pdi Inc., Huntington Station, NY).  
The amount of immunoreactive protein was 
determined from the integral of the optical density 
of the stained band.  Staining intensities of bands 
on each blot were normalized with a purified rat 
hepatic CYP1A1 standard that was included on 
every gel as an internal standard. 
 
Statistical analysis 
 
Data are presented as the mean – standard error of 
the mean of values determined from 10-20 fish per 
trawl site.  Correlations between hepatic 
microsomal EROD activities and CYP1A protein 
levels were analyzed by simple linear regression.  
Coefficients of variation (r
2
) with a p value <0.05 
were considered statistically significant. 
 
Results 
 
Table 1 lists mean values of body and liver weight, 
and total cytochrome P450 (CYP) content for liver 
microsomes prepared from fish treated with corn 
oil and b-naphthoflavone.  As can be seen from 
the data, liver weight was decreased and the total 
CYP content was increased for fish treated with b-
naphthoflavone in comparison with corn oil-
treated fish.  Table 2 lists mean values of total 
CYP content for liver microsomes prepared from 
fish collected from 5 sites.  As can be seen from 
the data, the mean value of total CYP content was 
variable for fish collected from the different sites. 
 
EROD activity was measured in English sole liver 
microsomes.  Mean values of fish from the five 
sites, along with mean values of t he b-naphtho-
flavone and corn oil-treated fish, are shown in 
Figure 1.  Treatment with b-naphthoflavone 
resulted in a large increase in EROD activity 
(approximately 18-fold) compared with corn oil-
treatment.  EROD activity was also elevated in 
fish from sites T -50 and T -38 compared to fish 
from sites T -49 and T -11B.  In fact, the mean 
EROD activity of fish from site T -50 was 
approximately 11-fold greater than the mean 
EROD activity of corn oil-treated fish and 4-fold 
greater than that of fish from site T-49. 
 
English sole liver microsomes were analyzed on 
immunoblots probed with antibody generated to a 
synthetic peptide corresponding to trout CYP1A1.  
This antibody detected a single protein band in the 
microsomal preparations, implying that English 
sole liver contains one protein that is 
immunochemically related to trout CYP1A1.  As 
seen on the immunoblot in Figure 2, the CYP1A 
band in microsomal preparations of fish from site 
T-50 was stained more intensely than the band in 
fish from site T -49, indicating that there is 
increased expression of CYP1A protein in fish 
from site T-50 relative to site T-49.

The microsomal CYP1A protein in all 88 English 
sole was quantified by densitometry and the data 
are displayed in Figure 3.  As was the case with 
EROD activity, the mean CYP1A protein level 
was increased after treatment with b-naphtho-
flavone (approximately 13-fold) relative to fish 
treated with corn oil.  CYP1A protein levels were 
elevated in fish from sites T -50, T -38, and T -48 
compared to fish from sites T-49 and T-11B.  The 
CYP1A expression livers of fish from site T -50 
was approximately equal to that of b-naphtho-
flavone-treated fish and was 7 -fold greater than 
that of fish from site T-49.

Fig. 4 Correlation between hepatic EROD 
activity and CYP1A protein levels in English sole 
samples. 
The relationship between CYP1A protein levels 
and EROD activity for all 88 fish was examined 
(see Fig. 4).  As expected, CYP1A protein levels 
were found to be highly correlated with EROD 
activity (r
2
 = 0.66, p < 0.05). 
 
No correlation was found between age of the 
English sole and CYP1A levels or EROD activity.  
When fish were segregated according to sex, no 
correlation was found between sex and EROD 
activity for fish from most of the sites.  The 
exception was site T -11B, where EROD activity 
was greater in female than male fish, but the 
number of male and female fish in this group, as in 
most of the other groups, was too small for 
rigorous statistical analysis. 
 
The relationship between CYP1A levels and 
sediment concentrations of various organochlorine 
and polyaromatic hydrocarbon compounds was 
examined.  Sediment chemistry data from the 
PICES Vancouver Harbour Workshop indicated 
high levels of high molecular weight aromatic 
compounds (>4000 ng/g dry weight) and high 
levels of PCBs (>40 ng/g dry weight) at site T-48, 
with slightly lower levels at site T -38 (4500 and 
34 ng/g dry weight, respectively), and even lower 
levels at site T-49 (2000 and 9.5 ng/g dry weight, 
respectively).  Site T -50 is unusual in that very 
low or undetectable levels of these compounds 
were found at this site.  Thus, it appears that, 
except for site T-50, there is a positive correlation 
between the amount of CYP1A in English sole and 
total aromatic hydrocarbon and total PCB levels in 
sediments at these sites. 
 
Discussion 
 
The present study, using English sole liver 
samples collected from 5 sites in and around 
Vancouver Harbour demonstrated the following: 
 
1. Hepatic microsomal EROD activity was 
induced 18-fold by b-naphthoflavone 
treatment and was 5 to 9 times greater in fish 
from sites T -38 (Indian Arm), T -48 (Port 
Moody), and T-50 (Howe Sound) than in corn 
oil-treated fish. 
2. Hepatic CYP1A protein levels were 5 to 6 
times greater in fish from sites T -38 (Indian

3. Hepatic microsomal EROD activity and 
CYP1A protein levels were well correlated, 
supporting the role of CYP1A as the primary 
catalyst of EROD activity in English sole. 
4. A comparison of sediment chemistry data 
showed that fish with increased CYP1A 
expression came from sites (T-38 and T -48) 
containing relatively high levels of 
polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and 
organochlorine compounds, suggesting that 
CYP1A was induced in English sole by 
environmental exposure to PAHs and PCBs 
and related compounds. 
5. The sediment data does not explain the high 
EROD activity and CYP1A protein levels 
found in fish from site T -50 (Howe Sound).  
We assume that induction of CYP1A induced 
in these fish was caused by e nvironmental 
exposure to effluent from pulp and paper mills 
nearby (e.g. the Port Mellon mill). 
6. Hepatic EROD activity and CYP1A protein 
levels in English sole are effective indicators 
of hydrocarbon pollutant levels in the marine 
environment.

Introduction 
 
Organotin compounds, such as tributyltin (TBT) 
and triphenyltin (TPhT), have been used 
worldwide in antifouling paints for ships and 
fishing nets since the mid-1960s, and have caused 
imposex in neogastropods and mesogastropods in 
the world (Goldberg 1986; Horiguchi 2000).  
Imposex is defined as a superimposition of male 
sexual organs (penis and vas deferens) on female 
gastropods, and may bring about reproductive 
failure at severely affected stages (Smith 1971; 
Gibbs and Bryan 1986; Gibbs et al. 1987, 1988, 
1990).  Imposex is thought to be endocrine 
disruption induced by TBT and TPhT in 
gastropods (Matthiessen and Gibbs 1998). 
 
The use of TBT has been banned in antifouling 
paints for ships smaller than 25 m in length in 
many developed countries, such as European 
countries and the United States, since the 1980s 
(Stewart 1996).  In Japan, the production, import 
and use of organotins (TBT and TPhT) have been 
regulated by law and administrative guidance 
since 1990, resulting in no production in 1997 
(Horiguchi 2000).  TBT-based antifouling paints, 
however, have still been used in developing 
countries, such as Asian countries, and also for 
most vessels larger than 25 m in length (Stewart 
1996; Horiguchi 2000).  The worldwide ban of 
TBT is being discussed by the Marine 
Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) of 
the International Maritime Organization (IMO) 
(Horiguchi, 2000). 
 
A PICES Practical Workshop was held from May 
24 to June 7, 1999, in Vancouver, Canada.  The 
aim of this study is to know the tissue 
concentrations of organotin (butyltin and 
phenyltin) compounds in molluscs (gastropods and 
bivalves) from Vancouver, the imposex symptoms 
in gastropods around Vancouver, and to assess the 
present status on organotin contamination in 
Vancouver. 
 
Materials and methods 
 
Molluscan specimens (gastropods and bivalves) 
were collected at 15 sites near Vancouver and 
Victoria during the Workshop.  After sampling 
them, raw or frozen gastropod specimens were 
used for imposex identification:  sex determination 
and imposex identification were anatomically 
done (Gibbs et al. 1987).  The degree of imposex 
was expressed as incidence (frequency) (%), 
Relative Penis Length (RPL) Index (%), Relative 
Penis Size (RPS) Index (%) and Vas Deferens 
Sequence (VDS) Index through the measurement 
of penis length and observation of the 
development of vas deferens (Gibbs et al. 1987; 
Horiguchi et al. 1994). 
 
Chemical analysis of organotin (butyltin and 
phenyltin) compounds in tissues of both gastropod 
and bivalve specimens were conducted by the 
methods described in Horiguchi et al. (1994).  
Briefly, tissues were extracted with  
0.1% tropolone/benzene and 1N HBr/ethanol by 
ultrasonication, derivatized with propylmagnesium 
bromide, cleaned by silica gel column 
chromatography and quantified by gas 
chromatography with a flame photometric 
detection (GC-FPD).  The detection limit of the 
instrument was 50 pg, and certified reference 
material of Japanese sea bass, Lateolabrax 
japonicus, for TBT and TPhT analysis (prepared 
by the National Institute for Environmental 
Studies; NIES CRM No. 11) was used for quality 
53
 
  
assurance and quality control.  The analytical 
conditions are described in more detail in 
Horiguchi et al. (1994). 
 
Results and discussion 
 
No neogastropod specimens (e.g. Nucella lima) 
were collected at sites in Vancouver in this study.  
No neogastropod specimens were collected either 
in the survey around Vancouver in 1994 (Tester et 
al. 1996).  Neogastropods, such as Nucella, 
however, were observed around Vancouver in the 
1970s (Levings, personal communication).  It is 
possible that neogastropod populations have been 
wiped out by some biological and/or 
environmental factors in Vancouver since the 
1980s. 
 
Results on imposex survey in the file dogwinkle, 
Nucella lima, and the frilled dogwinkle, Nucella 
lamellosa, from Ogden Point, Clover Point and 
Ten-mile Point in Victoria, and from Mission 
Point in Wilson Creek (see Section I, Fig. 1.5) are 
shown in Table 1.  Slightly affected imposex was 
observed in populations of both the file dogwinkle 
and frilled dogwinkle (3.3 - 19.0, 0.004 - 0.7 and 
1.1 - 2.9 for RPL, RPS and VDS Indices in the file 
dogwinkle and 8.2 – 23.1, 0.1 – 1.2 and 1.0 for 
RPL, RPS and VDS Indices in the frilled 
dogwinkle, respectively) although the incidences 
of imposex were high (71-100% and 100% in 
populations of the file dogwinkle and the frilled 
dogwinkle, respectively).  
 
Butyltin concentrations in tissue of both the file 
dogwinkle and frilled dogwinkle are shown in 
Figure 1.  Phenyltin compounds were not detected 
in both the file dogwinkle and frilled dogwinkle.  
Regarding TBT, 2.4 – 14.4 ng/g wet wt. and 6.5 – 
22.0 ng/g wet wt. were detected in the file 
dogwinkle and frilled dogwinkle, respectively.  
Total butyltin concentrations in tissue (sum of 
TBT and its metabolites, monobutyltin (MBT) and 
dibutyltin (DBT)) of the file dogwinkle and frilled 
dogwinkle were 7.3 – 28.8 ng/g wet wt. and 10.8 – 
44.0 ng/g wet wt., respectively.

Comparison of these analytical values with 
reported concentrations of TBT and/or butyltin 
compounds in tissues of organisms shows that 
TBT and/or butyltin concentrations detected in the 
dogwinkles from the sites of Victoria and Wilson 
Creek were relatively low (Belfroid et a l. 2000; 
Environmental Agency of Japan 1999; Tanabe et 
al. 1998; Takahashi et al. 1997).  As imposex 
seems to have been extensively caused by 
relatively low contamination levels of TBT in 
dogwinkle populations surveyed in this study, it is 
suggested that d ogwinkles may be sensitive to 
TBT and that imposex may be induced even at a 
low environmental concentration of TBT in 
dogwinkles.  Under laboratory experimental 
conditions, imposex was induced at 64 ng/l of 
average exposure concentration of TBT for 120 
days in the file dogwinkle, and bioconcentration 
factor of TBT was estimated to be approximately 
2200 (Stickle et al. 1990). 
 
Biological monitoring using the foolish mussel, 
Mytilus trossulus, was also carried out to 
determine the present status on organotin 
contamination in Vancouver.  Results on chemical 
analysis of organotin compounds in tissues of the 
foolish mussel specimens are shown in Figure 2.  
Phenyltin compounds were not detected in the 
foolish mussel specimens either.  Butyltin 
compounds were detected in foolish mussel 
specimens from all of sites surveyed, including a 
reference site (I-7), with a maximum concentration 
of 173.2 ng/g wet wt. (I-4).  TBT was the most 
predominant among butyltin compounds detected 
in the foolish mussel, except for the specimens 
from I -3-A station:  DBT was the most 
predominant among butyltin species detected in 
the foolish mussel from I-3-A, possibly suggesting 
some sources of the contamination of DBT near  
I-3-A because DBT has been used in PVC 
stabilizer.  
 
Concentrations of TBT detected in tissues of the 
foolish mussel from Vancouver in this study were 
relatively high, compared with those of TBT in 
marine organisms reported in recent publications, 
although they were below the tolerable average 
residue level of Canada (Belfroid et al. 2000; 
Environmental Agency of Japan 1999; Takahashi 
et al. 1997).  TBT concentrations in sediment core

(Burrard Inlet) do not show the temporal declining 
but still high (Thompson 1997).  It could result 
from a continuous use of TBT in antifouling paints 
for vessels larger than 25 m in length, and a 
persistence of TBT in bottom sediments.  TBT 
contamination was therefore confirmed to have 
still continued in Vancouver.  Based on the results 
mentioned above, it is strongly believed that one 
of the causal factors having wiped out 
neogastropod populations in Vancouver is TBT 
from antifouling paints. 
 
A remarkable difference of TBT accumulation in 
tissue was observed among the bivalve species 
(Fig. 3).  The highest concentration of TBT was 
detected in the horse clam, Tresus capax (2229.9 
ng/g wet wt.).  Although bioconcentration factor 
of TBT and/or bioavailability of TBT through 
contaminated sediment are unknown in the horse 
clam, remarkably high concentration of TBT in 
tissue may have caused some adverse effects in the 
horse clam because some chronic toxicities have 
been observed in bivalves by exposure to low 
concentrations of TBT (Alzieu and Heral 1984; 
Thain and Waldock 1986; Bryan et al. 1987; 
Lawler and Aldrich 1987; Salazar and Champ 
1988).  Further study is necessary to examine 
possible adverse effects in the horse clam.  
Regarding the ratio of butyltin species in tissue, 
TBT was the most predominant in almost all 
bivalve specimens surveyed, suggesting low 
metabolic rate of TBT in these bivalve species.  
Phenyltin compounds were not detected in 
bivalves other than the foolish mussel either.

The highest TBT concentration in tissue was 
consistently observed in the Pacific oyster, 
Crassostrea gigas, among the marine invertebrates 
collected in every intertidal zone of 3 sites of 
Japan (Horiguchi et al., unpublished data).  As 
TBT concentrations in tissue were also 
consistently higher in the Pacific oyster than in the 
foolish mussel in this study, the Pacific oyster 
could be useful for biological monitoring of TBT 
contamination.

Objectives of this work during the MEQ Practical 
Workshop were to assess degree of pollution in 
Vancouver Harbour by analyzing macrobenthic 
community structure, and examine the potential 
usefulness of higher-level taxa of macrobenthos in 
detecting degree of pollution. 
 
Samples for benthic community studies were 
collected with a Van Veen grab at 7 stations on a 
presumed pollution gradient from the head of 
Vancouver Harbour through to Howe Sound (see 
Section I, Fig. 1.2).  5 replicate grab samples were 
taken at each site.  Sediments were immediately 
passed through a 0.5 mm sieve.  Benthic 
organisms were removed from the sieve, and 
preliminary sorting of fauna was carried out in the 
West Vancouver Laboratory, Fisheries and Oceans 
Canada.  Samples were preserved and transported 
to Russia and Korea for further analysis.   
 
Detailed identification of polychaetes was 
completed at the Far Eastern Regional 
Hydrometeorological Institute (Vladivostok),  
 
ophiuroids, nemertineans, crustaceans, sipunculans 
and others at the Institute of Marine Biology 
(Vladivostok), and molluscs at the Korean Ocean 
Research and Development Institute (Seoul).  The 
data were then combined for community analyses 
using a station by species matrix. 
 
The sediments were analyzed for grain size at 
KORDI using standard sieving and settling tube 
technique.  It was shown that all stations are 
characterized by mud, except the Howe Sound 
station that is dominated by sand.  171 species 
were identified in the sorted 8 faunal groups.  The 
stations were divided into 3 groups by species and 
abundance similarity:  2 stations in Port Moody 
Arm, 4 stations in the Inner and Outer Harbours, 
and 1 station in Howe Sound.   
 
Some preliminary results on faunal composition 
(Fig. 1 -3, Table 1), along with interpretation of 
changes relative to the data on contaminants in the 
sediments found by other researchers (Fig. 4) are 
presented in this report.

Fish communities and life history attributes of English sole ( Pleuronectes 
vetulus) in Vancouver Harbour 
 
Colin D. LEVINGS and Stacey Ong 
West Vancouver Laboratory, Science Branch, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Canada 
 
 
Introduction 
 
The species composition of fish communities has 
been proposed as a key variable to assess the 
biological integrity of estuarine ecosystems 
(Deegan et al. 1997), and is also used as a 
monitoring variable to detect changes in coastal 
water quality.  In this paper, we report on the 
spatial changes and relative abundance of 
demersal or bottom dwelling fish in Vancouver 
Harbour, and evaluate the usefulness of the data 
for evaluation of environmental quality in the 
context of the PICES Practical Workshop.  There 
are some data available on fish communities in 
Vancouver Harbour collected several decades or 
years ago (Levings 1973; Goyette and Thomas 
1987, Goyette and Boyd 1989, Washington Dept 
of Fish and Wildlife 1995), enabling comparisons 
over the longer term.  The English sole 
(Pleuronectes vetulus) was identified as a 
dominant demersal species in the earlier work.  
Because the physiological and health status of 
English sole was studied extensively by other 
investigators in the Workshop, basic data on 
length, weight, age and growth, and feeding were 
also obtained. 
 
Methods 
 
Field sampling 
 
A small otter trawl  (mesh size in body/wing  
38 mm, 3.2 mm in codend, width of opening 
estimated 4.9 m) was towed by the NOAA vessel 
Harold W. S treeter at 5 stations, on a presumed 
pollution gradient from inner to outer Vancouver 
Harbour ( see Section I, Fig 1.4; Table 1).  Each 
station was sampled between 3 and 7 times.  The 
net was towed between 5 and 10 minutes, and 
sampled an estimated area of between 1 ,643 to 
8,570 m
2
 in each trawl.

The catch from each trawl was sorted by species, 
then enumerated by species and weight.  The 
larger invertebrates such as Dungeness crab 
(Cancer magister), tanner crab ( Chionocetes 
tanneri), anemone ( Metridium spp) and a few 
species of bivalve molluscs were also enumerated 
and weighed.  The total length of each English 
sole in the catch was measured to the nearest 
millimetre.  Data on weight, stomach content, and 
age were obtained for English sole specimens 
autopsied by Stehr et al. (this report) for 
physiological condition and histopathology.  The 
minimum size for the latter studies was 25 cm, the 
approximate length of sexual maturity for this 
species.  After autopsy, the stomach was removed 
from each fish and preserved in 3.7% formalin.  
For ageing, the right otolith was removed and 
placed in a glycerol-thymol mixture. 
 
Laboratory methods 
 
Stomach contents of a random sample of 10 
English sole stomachs were examined in the 
laboratory.  A Wild M -5 Stereomicroscope was 
used to enumerate organisms, which were 
identified to the major group level.  Ages were 
 
61
 
  
determined by the Fish Aging Unit, DFO Science 
Branch, Pacific Biological Station, Nanaimo.  
Condition factor was computed using Fulton's K 
where K = wt/l

Results 
 
Fish community data 
 
The mean number of fish species obtained in the 
trawls ranged from 11 (se 0.5) at station T-38 to 
12.2 (se 0.2) at T-49.  However based on the total 
number of species caught in the trawls at a 
particular site, the fish community at Station  
T-11B was most diverse (19 species), with the 
other stations as follows:  T-38, 12 species; T-48, 
16 species; T-49, 17 species; and T-50, 17 species.  
Mean biomass ranged from 0.65 kg·100 m
-2 
(se 
0.1) at T-38 to 0.15 kg·100 m
-2
 (se 0.1) at T-11B,  
 
and number of individuals from 350 100 m
-2 
 (se 
50)·to 100·100 m
-2 
(102) at the latter 2 stations. 
 
15 fish species accounted for at least 1% of the 
catch in the trawls at particular stations (Table 2).  
Flatfish (Pleuronectidae and Bothidae) were the 
dominant species, especially English sole 
(Pleuronectes vetulus), Starry flounder 
(Platichthys stellatus), Flathead sole 
(Hippoglossoides elassodon), Dover sole 
(Microstomus pacificus), Rex sole ( Errex 
zachirus), slender sole (Lyopsetta exilis) and Rock 
sole (Pleuronectes bilineatus).  Flatfish were the 
dominant taxa at the inner harbour station (T-38), 
accounting for more than 50% of the fish caught 
there.  Other dominant species were the Pacific 
tomcod (Microgadus proximus) and the blackbelly 
eelpout ( Lycodopsis pacifica).  Species 
composition at the five sites differed significantly 
(p<0.05) after testing with c

significantly higher (p<0.05) compared to the 
other stations. 
 
Length, sex ratio, and age 
 
Mean English sole length was 291 mm (se 4.6) at 
Station T -38, 270 mm (se 4.7) at T -48, 242 mm 
(se 4.6) at T -11b, 254 mm (se 3.9) at T -49, and 
240 mm (se 4.8) at T-50.  As judged by ANOVA, 
lengths were significantly different between 
stations (Table 3, p<0.05), with the largest fish at 
Station T-38.  Mean lengths at Station T-38 were 
statistically significant (p<0.05) when tested 
against all other stations.  Comparisons among the 
other stations were variable. 
 
Sex ratio 
 
Female English sole were more common (chi -
square, P<0.05) in the inner harbour stations  
(T-50, T -48, and T -11B) relative to the outer 
harbour stations (Table 4). 
Age and growth 
 
Age of the English sole ranged from 2 - 15 years  
(Fig. 2) and mean age over all stations and sexes 
was 7.3 y.  Mean age at the various stations were 
9.3 y at T-38, 7.4 y at T-48, 6.4 y at T-11B, 6.3 y 
at T -49, a nd 7.4 y at T -50.  The percentage 
accounted for the various age groups was 
significantly (p<0.05) different over all the 
stations, as judged by chi-square.  More older fish 
were found in the inner harbour stations.  The only 
14 and 15 y fish in the survey were caught at 
station T-38.

English sole growth was estimated by the slope of 
the regression line between age (x) and length (y). 
Using combined data for both males and females, 
English sole grew fastest at station T -11B 
(y=9.35x + 182.25), followed by T-38 (y=3.31x + 
265.77), T-48 (y=3.05x + 248.11), T-50 (y=1.92x

Condition factor 
 
Condition factor was lower for male and female 
English sole at Stations T-38 and T-50 (K < 0.787) 
relative t o the other three stations (K > 0.808) 
(Table 5).

Introduction  
 
An International Practical Workshop on biological 
effects of pollutants, organised by the Marine 
Quality Committee of PICES, took place from 
May 24 to June 7, 1999, in Vancouver, British 
Columbia, Canada.  Specialists from all PICES 
member countries participated in the sampling and 
analysing of the data obtained to detect biological 
consequences of contaminants in the marine 
environment.  
To evaluate marine environment quality, a set of 
chemical and biological properties was used.  
Biological properties included the characteristics 
of polychaete taxocene.  Polychaetes are one of 
the most important groups of marine benthic 
animals.  This group is characterised by high 
species richness and diversity as well as high 
biomass and density (up to 80% of total benthos 
abundance).  In addition, polychaetes have a high 
level of tolerance to adverse effects – both to 
pollution and natural perturbation (Bryan and 
64
 
  
Gibbs 1987; Burd and Brinkhurst 1990; Levings et 
al. 1985; Rygg 1985a, b).  Thus, the state of 
polychaete taxocenes indicates the state of marine 
bottom communities as a whole.  So, for marine 
environmental quality assessment we used 
characteristics of polychaete taxocene and 
sediment chemistry data. 
 
Materials and methods  
 
Sampling design 
 
Benthic samples were collected in Vancouver 
Harbour in May-June of 1999 (see Section I,  
Fig. 1.2).  7 sites were sampled:  one in Howe 
Sound (B-50), one in Outer Harbour (B-49), two 
in Inner Harbour (B-3A, B -11B), one in Indian 
Arm (B-48), two in Port Moody (B-38, B -41B).   
5 replicate sediment samples were taken at each 
site with a Van-Veen grab (0.11 m
2
) to analyse a 
set of chemical and biological properties. 
 
Sample processing  
 
The sediments were washed by seawater through a 
1-mm sieve, and residues including macrobenthos 
were preserved with a 4% buffered formaldehyde 
solution.  In the laboratory, benthic organisms 
were sorted from the sediment to major taxa.  All 
individuals were identified to species level, but 
some organisms could only be identified to higher 
taxa.  Wet weight of macrofauna was determined: 
organisms were blotted and air-dried for 
approximately one minute prior to weighing 
(Bilyard and Becker 1987). 
 
Data analysis  
 
The software package PRIMER (Plymouth 
Routines In Multivariate Ecological Research), 
developed at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory was 
used for data analysis (Clarke and Green 1988, 
IOC 1983, UNEP 1995, UNESCO 1988).  
Univariate measures included Margalef richness 
index (R), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H), 
Pielou evenness index (e), Simpson domination 
index (Si), total polychaetes biomass (B), 
abundance (N), and number of polychaetes species 
(S).  Ecological indices were calculated as:  
H = - p
i
·(log
2
p
i
), 
e = H/log
2
S 
R = (S-1)/log
2
N; 
Si =   (p
i
)
2
 
where p
i
 is the proportion of abundance i-th 
species from total abundance of polychaetes;  S is 
total number of polychaetes species. 
 
Multivariate techniques included ordination of 
benthic samples by Multi-Dimensional Scaling 
(MDS) and their classification by clustering.  
Clustering was done by a hierarchical 
agglomerative method which employs group-
average linking of Bray-Curtis similarities, after 
the 4
th
 root transformation.  Species biomass data, 
excluding those with count less than 2% of total 
polychaete biomass, were used.  Ordination of 
polychaete taxocene parameters and environment 
factors was by Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA). 
 
Results and discussion  
 
In total, 82 polychaete species were found.  The 
biomass matrix consisted of 82 species at 7 sites, 
and was subjected to ordination and cluster-
analysis.  Results of ordination are shown in 
Figures 1.  MDS technique detected 4 groups of 
stations according to dissimilarity of species 
composition.  The reliability of this diagram was 
tested by value of stress coefficient.  Low values

of this coefficient (0.01–0.05) indicate excellent 
correspondence and reliability.  Thus these groups 
of stations have different species compositions.  
 
Cluster-analysis confirmed the result of ordination, 
and detected the same 4 groups of stations as well, 
shown in Figures 2 and 3.  The first diagram 
shows the results for 5 replicates, while the second 
diagram demonstrates the results of average 
biomass for 7 sites.

hierarchical clustering fop 5 replicates from each 
of 7 sites, using group-average linking of Bray-
Curtis similarities calculated on √√-transformed 
biomass data.  
The lowest Bray-Curtis sites similarity (15%) is 
observed between Site B-50 and the other sites.  
This may be explained by the natural 
environmental factors:  depth and sediment type.  
Site B-50 is located at the deepest part of the 
research area – at a depth of 50 m on fine sands.  
While the other sites are disposed at the silty 
sediments with depths from 10 to 29 m, except for 
Site B-49, which is located at a depth of 49 m.  
Low Bray-Curtis species similarity (about 20%) is 
observed between Group IV (Sites B-38 and  
B-41B) and the others groups.  But these 
differences probably have been caused by 
anthropogenic factors:  sediment pollution and 
influence of H

Table 1 demonstrates the range of pollutant 
concentrations in bottom sediments that negatively 
affects marine benthos.  These values were 
obtained by American and Canadian scientists 
(Boyd et al. 1998, Long et al. 1995).  Pollution 
loads at the level of effects in initial reversible 
changes in benthic communities (range-low 
concentrations results), and at the level of effects 
in reduction of benthos abundance and species 
richness in communities, and 50% mortality in 
toxicological experiments (range-medium 
concentrations results).  As shown in Table 2, 
these concentrations of trace metals, DDTs, PCBs, 
LACs and HACs were found at 5 stations. 
 
The PCA of sediment chemistry data 
(concentrations of 22 pollutants in bottom 
sediments) detected 4 groups of stations, shown in 
Figure 4.  Group II (sites B-38 and B-41B) is 
characterized by maximal and increasing 
concentrations of organic contaminant in bottom 
sediments.  Site B-3A has maximal concentrations 
of trace metals.  Low pollutant content was 
recorded at site B-50.  Group III (sites B-11B,  
B-48, and B-49) is characterized by intermediate 
position.  In this diagram Group II (sites B-38 and 
B-41B) disposes separately from the other sites, as 
it was shown in Figure 1.  So we can propose that 
strong species dissimilarity of Sites B-38 and  
B-41B compared with other sites may be evidence 
of pollutant impact.  
 
The PCA of polychaete taxocene characteristics, 
including number of species and ecological 
indices, has also indicated 4 groups (Fig. 5).  
Group I and II (sites B-38 and B-41B) have lowest 
values of number of species, as well as indices of 
diversity and richness.  Site B-38 has maximal 
values of domination index.  Domination of 
tolerant pollution species Tharyx multifilis and low 
density of sensitive-pollution species (Scoloplos 
armiger, Laonice cirrata) were detected at these 
stations.  Sites of Group IV (B-50, B-49, B-48, 
and B-11B) are characterized by the highest values 
of the number of species, and maximal richness 
and diversity of polychaetes.  Site B-3A is very 
close to Group IV.

Thus, sediment quality assessment indicates: 
 
• Severe adverse effect at sites B-38 and B-41B; 
• Sites B-48, B-49 and B-11B are characterized 
by low and moderate adverse effects; 
• Site B -3A, judging by ecological indices and 
species structure has an intermediate position 
between severe and moderate adverse effects.

Introduction 
 
As part of the work conducted during the Practical 
Workshop sponsored by the Marine 
Environmental Quality Committee of the North 
Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES), a 
harmful algae survey was carried out, including 
shellfish PSP distribution, ARTOX test and cyst 
distribution.  Samples were collected during May 
23 to June 8, 1999, at 9 stations in Vancouver 
Harbour (Fig. 1). 
 
Material and methods 
 
Shellfish sample collection 
 
Shellfish samples collected for algal toxin analysis 
at each station are shown in Table 1.  About 500g 
of whole mussels Mytilus trossuous were collected 
at each intertidal sampling site.  Clam samples 
were also obtained from some interdital beaches 
(Ruditapes philippinarium, Venerupis staninea)  
 
and from benthic trawling (Clinocardium nuttallii, 
Yoldia sp.).  Samples were weighed and processed 
immediately after collection, and then frozen for 
later lyophilizing.  After lyophilization, samples 
were weighed and then stored in the laboratory 
before analysis. 
 
Mouse bioassay 
 
The AOAC mouse bioassay method (AOAC 1990) 
for PSP was used in the investigation.  Mice 
(strain ICR) were purchased from the Medical 
Inspection Institute of Qingdao.  A dry sample 
(0.5g) was extracted with 3 ml 0.1N HCl, ultra-
sonicated for 8 · 10 seconds, then centrifuged at 
10,000 rpm for 10 minutes.  1 ml of supernant was 
used for mouse injection, and 1 ml 0.1N HCl was 
used as control.  Purified STX at concentrations of 
0.147 µg/ml and 0.294 µg/ml of STX (purchased 
from the National Research Council, Canada) 
were also tested.  Symptoms exhibited by mice 
after injection were observed, and lethal time was 
recorded.

Artemia Toxicity Test (ARTOX) 
 
Several species of macroalgae were collected at 
each intertidal sampling site.  Attached microalgal 
cells were scraped from macroalgae and 
concentrated for testing. 
 
Artemia cysts were obtained from the Artemia 
Center in Belgium and kept at a low temperature 
(about 4  C) during transportation and storage.  
Hatching was initiated 2 days before experiments 
in Petri-dishes.  10 Artemia larvae at the second or 
third instar stage were transferred under a 
dissection microscope to 4 wells of the 6 · 4-well 
plates.  Each well contained 1 ml of test algal 
culture.  Each group consisted of three replicate 
wells and one rinsing well which was used to 
minimize dilution of the test solution during 
shrimp transfer.  The Artemia were observed 
during the exposure at several-hour intervals and 
surviving Artemia were counted after 24 hours of 
incubation in the darkness.  Seawater was used as 
a control in the Artemia test.  Quality control tests 
were carried out using potassium dichromate

 as the positive control toxin according to 
the standardized protocol of the method.  
 
Replicate sediment core samples were collected 
near sites I -7, I -3 and I -6 (Fig. 1).  The surficial 
sediment of each core was incubated using 
phytoplankton growth medium and optimal light 
 
conditions for approximately 3 weeks.  S ub-
samples were collected every few days and 
preserved in Lugol’s Solution.  These samples will 
be analyzed for phytoplankton abundance and 
composition.  The germination of potentially 
harmful phytoplankton will be documented. 
 
Results 
 
PSP analysis in shellfish samples 
 
Wet and dry weight of shellfish samples collected 
from each station are shown in Table 2.  Table 3 
includes only intertidal samples.  Only mussel 
samples were found to contain PSP.  PSP was not 
determined in other shellfish samples, not even in 
shellfish collected from the sites which were very 
close to the site where PSP has been detected in 
mussel samples such as Venerupis staninea from 
site I -4 and Clinocardium nuttallii from site I -1.  
Table 4 shows that the PSP concentrations in 
mussels were all lower than eqv. STX 20 µg/100g 
ww, which is below the common limit of eqv. 
STX 80µg / 100g ww. 
 
The results indicated that PSP was found only in 
mussels, and only in English Bay and Burrard 
Inlet, but not in Port Moody and Gibsons.  The 
concentrations showed a decreasing trend from the 
West Vancouver to the east of Vancouver Harbour 
(Fig. 2).

+: swimming behavior of Artemia was inhibited and 24h LC50 of Artemia was about 50%. 
 
 
Artemia test 
 
Positive results of the sample from Longsdale 
Quay I -3A (Table 5) indicated that toxic algae 
such as Heterosigma or DSP producer 
Prorocentrum lima might be present in the water 
(Demaret et al. 1995).  However, no toxicity was 
found from re-samples collected 4 days later. 
 
Discussion 
 
PSP contents and toxin profile will be further 
studied using HPLC.  Cyst distribution work 
undertaken by T. Sutherland will be submitted 
once finished.
