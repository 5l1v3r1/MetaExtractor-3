Executive Summary 
 
 
Aquatic non-indigenous species (NIS) continue to threaten marine ecosystems, including seafood safety and 
security.  To inform risk assessments predicting the likelihood and consequences of new invasions, it is critical 
to understand global NIS distributions, habitat tolerances/preferences, potential dispersal vectors and probable 
impacts related to new incursions.  To this end, the NIS database developed by the North Pacific Marine 
Science Organization (PICES) Working Group on Non-Indigenous Aquatic Species (WG 21), with funding 
from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan through the Fisheries Agency of 
Japan, summarizes large-scale data which can be used by managers to develop monitoring programs for early 
detection or rapid response, and to make mitigation plans for higher-risk NIS to limit the impacts on native 
biodiversity, including commercially important species, and ecosystem structure and function. 
 
The Atlas of Non-indigenous Marine and Estuarine Species in the North Pacific, compiled through the 
activities of WG 21, synthesizes information from a variety of sources and can serve as a valuable resource for 
agencies and scientists tasked with managing and researching NIS in the North Pacific.  Information included 
in the Atlas can help to identify and prioritize potential high-risk NIS and/or high-risk locations which can 
allow limited funding to be used effectively.  The usefulness of the Atlas was illustrated most recently by the 
arrival of a large floating dock in Newport, Oregon, USA that had been set adrift by the 2011 Great East Japan 
Earthquake and tsunami – this document was consulted by experts to aid in the identification and ecological 
risk assessment of organisms attached to the dock. 
 
Another lasting outcome from activities of WG 21 has been increased awareness and collaboration on NIS 
issues broadly, especially between PICES member countries and with developing countries and international 
organizations like the Northwest Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission’s Sub-Commission for the Western Pacific (WESTPAC), fostered through Rapid Assessment 
Surveys (RAS) and RAS demonstration workshops.  Capacity building has better prepared researchers both 
within and beyond PICES to deal with emerging NIS issues and is critical to better understanding invasion 
dynamics and maintaining safe and productive marine ecosystems. 
 
As marine NIS represent a current and persistent risk to PICES member countries, the NIS database and other 
accomplishments of WG 21 have positioned PICES to better comprehend and advance marine NIS topics, 
including emerging vectors (e.g., vessel biofouling, tsunami/marine debris), altered species distributions,  risk 
assessment, and interactions/impacts on marine ecosystems (including structure, function, productivity, and 
resilience).  There also is considerable interest about how projected global climate change will affect the 
introduction, spread and impacts of NIS in the North Pacific and to undertake risk identification to inform 
potential mitigation measures by PICES member countries. For example, global climate change and the 
associated decrease in Arctic ice cover, combined with the opening of new shipping routes, highlight the 
complexities of understanding marine NIS dynamics. Interest has been expressed by organizations such as 
ICES, NOWPAP and WESTPAC in addressing specific NIS vectors or taxa (e.g., tunicates, bivalves, 
European green crab) of common interest to many PICES member countries. This will allow continued 
exchange of knowledge across the North Pacific where many previous incursions have occurred and is an 
appropriate interface with the international community.  
 
There are many examples demonstrating that marine NIS are a significant stressor that can alter ecosystem 
structure and function, and thus there are strong linkages to the PICES FUTURE (Forecasting and 
Executive Summary 
viii  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific Ecosystems) program and the North 
Pacific Ecosystem Status Report. Thus, at a minimum PICES should establish an expert group that can 
continue to exchange information on changing marine NIS dynamics via the WG 21 NIS database. A 
continued NIS expert group could explore how climate change will alter NIS distributions around the North 
Pacific, including probable changes in NIS vectors (e.g., new shipping routes, expanding trade). Further, a new 
expert group could address how PICES member countries have been affected by NIS and what community 
responses have occurred due to NIS incursions in the North Pacific, an element directly aligned with 
FUTURE. This information would help inform policy and management options within each PICES member 
country. 
 
WG 21 proposed several options for PICES’ continued involvement in marine NIS issues, but the creation of 
an Advisory Panel on Aquatic Non-indigenous Species (AP-NIS) is the preferred option as it would allow 
continued progress on marine NIS issues, with the lowest resource commitment. 
 
This report summarizes the activities and accomplishments of WG 21 in fulfilment of its terms of reference, 
and recommends the establishment of an Advisory Panel on Non-indigenous Aquatic Species to continue work 
on NIS in the North Pacific.  
 
 
Section 1  Background 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  1 
1 Background 
 
Globally, non-indigenous species (NIS) are introduced intentionally or unintentionally to new locations across 
biogeographical boundaries by a variety of vectors, including commercial shipping, recreational boating, 
aquaculture transfers, and intentional and accidental release.  The most consequential NIS in terms of impact 
are those that become invasive as it is these species that can increase their geographic ranges quickly, dominate 
their new habitats, and fundamentally alter ecosystem structure and function.  In aquatic systems, invasive 
species pose a significant risk to native biodiversity and can potentially compromise food security and/or 
safety, especially for countries that rely heavily on seafood products.  For example, in shellfish aquaculture, 
invasive tunicates have become a global concern because they can displace and compete with both native and 
cultured species and foul aquaculture gear and products, thus compromising long-term productivity and 
sustainability.  Similarly, some invasive diatoms have been responsible for significant harmful algal bloom 
events that have threatened food safety for human consumption. 
 
No country is immune from the threat of aquatic NIS as species continue to be redistributed by a number of 
vectors.  However, by better understanding invasion dynamics and patterns it is possible to mitigate some of 
the risks associated with NIS. Effectively addressing this global threat requires knowledge across multiple 
spatial scales.  Understanding global distributions, habitat preferences, potential dispersal vectors and probable 
impacts related to potential invaders is a key for risk assessments predicting the likelihood and consequences 
of new invasions. 
 
The North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES) Working Group on Non-Indigenous Aquatic Species 
(WG 21) was created following a Marine Environmental Quality Committee (MEQ) workshop on “Introduced 
species in the North Pacific” held October 4, 2005, at the PICES Fourteenth Annual Meeting in Vladivostok, 
Russia (see Appendix 6). The workshop produced a recommendation and draft terms of reference for the 
creation of a working group on non-indigenous species. WG 21 was originally given a 3-year mandate that was 
extended and broadened following approval of a 5-year (April 1, 2007–March 31, 2012) project entitled 
“Development of the prevention systems for harmful organisms’ expansion in the Pacific Rim” funded by the 
Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) through the Fisheries Agency of Japan.  The 
first meeting of WG 21 was held in Yokohama, Japan, in October 2006 (PICES Fifteenth Annual Meeting) and 
the Working Group’s last meeting took place in Nanaimo, Canada in October 2013 (PICES Twenty-second 
Annual Meeting). 
 
One of the major components of the PICES/MAFF project, conducted by WG 21 was to develop tools to assist 
managers in the prevention and mitigation of NIS and to share these tools with developing countries bordering 
the Pacific Ocean.  WG 21’s goal was to address two key elements required for early detection of, and rapid 
response to, invasions.  The first initiative was the development of a comprehensive, searchable database and 
atlas of non-indigenous marine and estuarine species in the North Pacific (Database Initiative, with Dr. Henry 
Lee II, U.S. Environmental and Protection Agency, as the Principal Investigator).  The second initiative was to 
conduct a series of Rapid Assessment Surveys (RAS) to develop and disseminate techniques for the quick 
detection and identification of non-indigenous species that presently exist in a variety of habitats in PICES 
member countries (Taxonomy Initiative, with Dr. Thomas Therriault, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, as the 
Principal Investigator). 
 
In this report, we summarize the work that has been carried out by WG 21 (Appendix 2) to meet the objectives 
stated in the Terms of Reference (Appendix 1).  The report includes a glossary for non-indigenous species

terminology together with recommendations on their use (Section 2). The results from an extensive analysis of 
the database, where invasion patterns (taxa and vectors) in the North Pacific are compared and contrasted with 
other regions (Section 3). The outcome of a series of RAS conducted by WG 21 in PICES member countries 
and RAS demonstration and training workshops held in a number of Southeast Asian countries is provided in 
Section 4 (see also Appendix 5).  The report includes an inventory of expertise and programs related to aquatic 
NIS in PICES member countries and initiatives on prevention and mitigation measures, including national

the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) expert groups and PICES working groups on non-indigenous aquatic species 
(Section 7), followed by WG 21’s summary and recommendations (Section 8).

uncertainty over invasion history versus taxonomic 
uncertainty, Lee II and Reusser (2012) restricted 
the use of cryptogenic to locations where there is 
some evidence for invasion.

3 Assessment of the Status of Non-Indigenous Species in the PICES 
Area 
3.1 Inventory of Currently Reported Non-indigenous Marine and Estuarine 
Species in the North Pacific 
3.1.1 Development of a comprehensive database and atlas 
With funding provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (MAFF), WG 21 
created a non-indigenous marine and estuarine species in the North Pacific database (herein referred to as the 
NIS database) and generated an Atlas of Non-indigenous Marine and Estuarine Species in the North Pacific 
(herein referred to as the Atlas). The NIS database and Atlas (completed in 2012) synthesize and summarize 
the distribution, including invaded locations, of near-coastal and estuarine NIS in PICES member countries.  
The NIS database and Atlas integrate information from a number of sources (e.g., peer-reviewed literature, 
agency reports, websites, etc.) written in multiple languages into a single document for use by scientists and 
resource managers. In addition to occurrence data from the published literature, the NIS database also includes 
occurrences detected during rapid assessment surveys (RAS). (The RAS and the standardized data collection 
protocols will be discussed and described in Section 4.2 North Pacific Marine Non-Indigenous Aquatic Species 
Taxonomy Initiative). Some of the basic management uses of the distributional data in the Atlas and NIS 
database include: 
 
1. Establishing a baseline of the number of reported NIS by ecoregion; by coupling this data with RAS 
and/or monitoring programs, it will be possible to detect new NIS. 
2. Life history and environmental requirements for NIS can help identify what habitats and resources will be 
at greatest risk to an existing or new invader. 
3. Analysis of source (native) region(s) of NIS can be used to determine high risk regions and to develop 
focused quarantine procedures for imports. 
4. On a global scale, enumeration of the total number of ecoregions invaded by a species can help identify 
high risk invaders. Further, maps in the Atlas are a simple and visual approach to conveying the 
distribution of these species to managers and the public. 
 
Species profiles containing distribution, invasion vectors, life history and habitat information were collated for 
747 NIS found in PICES member countries, along with analyses of invasion patterns in the North Pacific 
(Table 3.1.1).  A read-only version of the NIS database (completed in 2012) was developed to run on Windows 
XP and Windows Vista operating systems, in conjunction with Access 2003 and Access 2007.  The database is 
being archived at the PICES Secretariat (www.pices.int) until such time as the software can be upgraded to 
work with newer operating systems and programs. The Atlas can be accessed at

3.1.2 Geographic and taxonomic scope of the data 
The Marine Ecosystems of the World (MEOW) biogeographic schema, including the marine ecoregion names, 
were used as the framework for displaying the global distributions of the species in the NIS database.
1
 This 
schema is hierarchical, consisting of four spatial levels from ocean basins (e.g., Temperate North Pacific 
Realm) to “ecoregions” at the finest scale.  
 
The Temperate North Pacific Realm captures most of the shorelines bordering the Pacific Ocean of the PICES 
member countries. This realm was divided into the Northeast Pacific (NEP) and Northwest Pacific (NWP) 
regions to allow transoceanic comparisons (Fig. 3.1.1).  The Hawaii Ecoregion, which is in the Eastern Indo-
Pacific Region, was included to provide broader coverage of the U.S. states within the North Pacific. For 
complete coverage of China and Japan, five ecoregions in the Central Indo-Pacific (Southern China, Gulf of 
Tonkin, South China Sea Oceanic Islands, South Kuroshio, and Ogasawara) were included. Collectively these 
five ecoregions are called the Northern Central Indo-Pacific (NCIP).  The total geographical extent for the 
North Pacific consists of 22 MEOW ecoregions, and the Arctic ecoregions bordering the United States (e.g., 
Eastern Bering Sea), Canada (e.g., Beaufort Sea), and Russia (e.g., Siberian seas) were not considered during 
the data collection phase and have not been included in the invasion pattern analyses. 
 
Within these ecoregions, NIS were considered in the analysis if they were either established or potentially 
established (unknown) in at least one of the 22 ecoregions to ensure that NIS were not excluded solely based 
on limited data.  The taxonomic scope includes fungi, protozoa, micro- and macro-algae, marine plants, fishes, 
and all macro-invertebrate groups. Bacteria, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles were not considered. 
Emergent marsh plants (other than Spartina) were not included, in part due to the difficulty in obtaining 
information on marsh species in Asia. Species that are primarily freshwater but have documented salinity 
tolerances and/or have been reported to occur in brackish waters were included, although freshwater species 
that only incidentally occur in low salinity regions were excluded. Primarily terrestrial species were excluded 
but species commonly found in the supralittoral and coastal zones were considered.

In addition to the species distribution and publication records, life history (e.g., salinity, reproduction), 
invasion (e.g., vector pathways), and habitat attributes were collected for each of the 747 established NIS in the 
North Pacific. The best way to view and access these data is from the generated species profiles compiled in 
the Atlas (https://www.pices.int/projects/default.aspx).  For example, Molgula manhattensis, a solitary tunicate 
native to the Atlantic coast of North America has invaded both sides of the Pacific Ocean (Fig. 3.1.2).  This 
NIS is a major component of fouling communities and can grow on cultured oysters and other bivalves, 
although it has not been reported to be a major aquaculture pest like other invasive tunicates.

3.1.3 Species classifications 
Within the NIS database species are assigned to six classifications – Native, Non-indigenous, Cryptogenic, 
Transient, Unknown, or Conflict – at any of the four biogeographic levels (realm to ecoregion). The following 
definitions were used for these classifications:  
 
Native: An indigenous species that occurs naturally in the area. 
 
Non-indigenous: A species that has been introduced into an area through human activities, whether accidently 
or on purpose. Other terms used include alien, aquatic nuisance species (ANS), exotic, introduced, non-native, 
adventive, and naturalized. Use of “invasive” was limited to NIS that have or are likely to cause adverse 
ecological, economic, or human health impacts.  
 
Cryptogenic: Cryptogenic species are not clearly native or introduced based on current information. As 
originally defined, this term was to capture uncertainty regarding a species biogeography and invasion history.  
However, “cryptogenic” is used increasingly for species with taxonomic uncertainties, such as sibling or 
cryptic species. To avoid mixing uncertainty over invasion history versus taxonomic uncertainty, we restricted 
the use of cryptogenic to locations where there is some evidence for invasion.  Cryptogenic species were not 
included in the counts of NIS for a location. 
 
Unknown: A species is classified as unknown when there is insufficient information to make a judgment as to 
its classification status. 
 
Transient: Transient species are those that temporarily migrate into an area as a result of unusual climatic 
conditions, such as El Niño.  Their movement into the area is via natural mechanisms rather than mediated 
through human activities, and they were not included in the counts of NIS for a location. The terms “vagrant” 
or “migrant” have been used in a similar fashion. 
 
Conflict: In some cases, invasion experts disagree as to whether a species is non-indigenous versus native or 
cryptogenic within a location.  If the available information was insufficient to make a decision among the 
conflicting classifications, a term “conflict” is used. Using “conflict” over “cryptogenic” is to highlight the 
cases where at least some experts believe that there is sufficient information to consider a species introduced. 
“Conflict” species were included in the counts of NIS within a location. 
3.1.4 Natural history attributes and species profiles 
Natural history attributes of a species can assist in predicting the likelihood that it will invade an area and 
possible consequences if an invasion occurs.  For example, salinity and depth ranges help define what habitats 
a species might invade, while trophic level can help define the type of impact an invader could have in a newly 
invaded ecosystem.  An additional objective of the NIS database was to develop a hierarchical topology to 
organize different types of natural history attributes. 
 
In the Atlas much of the information contained in the database is presented as “species’ profiles”.  The profiles 
are generated using a standardized format for the information and are limited to two pages for each species.  
With a key to the profiles, a user readily can determine the class value or quantitative value for any of the 
attributes included without the need to use the database. 
3.1.5 Caveats and updates 
This is one of the few attempts made to synthesize a variety of data at a basin scale. It is not the final answer, 
particularly since the type and extent of data varied widely across taxa and geographical locations.  By 
illustrating knowledge gaps in a standardized fashion, there is now a framework to promote finding missing 
information in the literature and/or collecting the data in the laboratory or field. 
Section 3  Status of NIS 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  15 
Existing literature was used to the extent possible to classify species as native or non-indigenous, but in many 
cases, decisions were made with limited information in locations scattered across the globe.  As such, 
classifications should be taken as “hypotheses”, subject to further taxonomic, biogeographical, and genetic 
analysis. In many cases, if existing data were inadequate, the term “unclassified” was used as the default. 
 
Another source of uncertainty is the population status of NIS. NIS with an “unknown” population status were 
included in counts of species within an ecoregion or region. Inclusion of species with an “unknown” 
population status may inflate the number of established NIS, and this issue arises more frequently with species 
in the NWP and NCIP rather than in the NEP and Hawaii, especially for aquaculture species.

3.2 Geographic Invasion Patterns in the North Pacific 
3.2.1 Total number of NIS in the North Pacific per taxonomic group and ecoregion 
For the present analysis, a species is considered introduced at the region level if it is introduced in any of the 
ecoregions making up the region, even if it is native in another ecoregion within the same region.  An analysis 
of the taxonomic composition of the 747 NIS reported from the 23 ecoregions in the North Pacific, Hawaii, 
and Northern Central-Indo Pacific and included in the database as of 2012, revealed that four phyla constituted 
more than 70% of the NIS (Fig. 3.2.1) – Arthropoda (224), Chordata (Tunicata + Fish) (114), Mollusca (110), 
and Annelida (89).  The number of NIS per ecoregion is provided in Figure 3.2.2.  More detailed taxonomic 
breakouts of geographic invasion patterns on the species level can be found in the Atlas.

It should be noted that the number of NIS is quite large, and is likely to increase. Following the completion of 
the NIS database in 2012, it has not been updated. A common portal to add information, update the database 
and share information is missing. There were plans to make the database a web-based application, but it has 
not been realized to date. 
3.2.2 Vectors 
An evaluation of the major vectors by which NIS were transported to the NEP, Hawaii, and NWP was 
conducted (Fig. 3.2.3).  Vectors analyzed here included ballast water discharges, hull fouling, intentional 
stocking, aquaculture escapees, aquaculture-associated species, and aquarium/plant trade.  Aquaculture 
escapees are species that are intentionally stocked but that escaped into the wild.  Aquaculture-associated 
species live on, or in association with, an aquaculture species and are accidently transported along with them 
(i.e., hitchhikers).  It is important to recognize that many, if not most, NIS are polyvectic and can be 
transported by more than one vector.  Thus, the values in Figure 3.2.3 sum to more than 100%.  Further, the 
primary introduction vector may differ from those contributing to spread at smaller spatial scales. 
 
Hull fouling and ballast water were important vectors in all three locations (Fig. 3.2.3).  One major difference 
among locations was the importance of intentional stocking and aquaculture escapees in the NWP compared to 
the NEP and Hawaii.  The high percentage in the NWP reflects the active aquaculture efforts in Asia, although 
for many of these species it is not known if they have actually established wild populations in Asia.  Another 
difference was the importance of aquaculture-associated species in the NEP, which accounted for 
approximately 42% of NIS.  To a large extent this reflects the large number of NIS introduced via the 
importation of Atlantic oyster (Crassostrea virginica) from the U.S. East Coast and the Pacific oyster 
(C. gigas) from Asia.  Though non-native oysters have been introduced into both the NWP and Hawaii, they 
do not appear to have been imported to same extent (volume/frequency) or way (adults with hitchhikers) as in 
the NEP.

exceed 100%. 
 
3.2.3 NIS in the North Pacific – Analysis of the inter-regional transfer of species and 
comparisons with other regions 
Introduction 
The objective of a subsequent more in-depth analysis of the NIS database was to examine the transfer of 
aquatic species across the North Pacific via various vectors, and to compare the patterns found in the North 
Pacific with other oceanic regions.  This analysis was based on the regions described in the Atlas (Fig. 3.2.4) 
but encompassed only NIS established in the NWP region, the NEP region, and the Hawaii ecoregion.  
Although the Hawaii ecoregion is part of the Eastern Indo-Pacific region, Hawaii is the only ecoregion in the 
EIP region that is part of the North Pacific. To enable comparisons where the native range of NIS includes 
both areas inside and outside the North Pacific, it is referred to as a separate “region” in the in-depth analysis 
for simplicity.  The NCIP region, which includes five ecoregions in the northern Indo-Pacific was not included 
as it does not form a natural biogeographic entity (Lee II and Reusser, 2012a,b).  Thus, in the in-depth analysis 
the “North Pacific” refers only to the NWP, the NEP, and Hawaii.  The patterns found in the North Pacific 
were compared and contrasted to three other marine regions, the Northwest Atlantic (NWA), the Northeast 
Atlantic (NEA), and the Mediterranean using a combined dataset with information on aquatic NIS established 
in all six regions.  The comparisons and contrasts were made for the following seven taxa: bivalves, 
amphipods, isopods, decapods, barnacles, tunicates, and ray-finned fishes as these tend to be well 
studied/documented taxa.  
 
Another objective of the in-depth analysis was to examine the geographic origin of the NIS that have established 
in the North Pacific.  However, as the introduction of species can be the result of primary introductions (from 
the species’ native range) or secondary spread (from previously invaded sites where the species is non-native), 
the status as native/non-native in a given area is often associated with much uncertainty.  Therefore, only 
information on the native range of a given NIS was included in the in-depth analysis.  We recognize that species 
may have been introduced to and transferred within the North Pacific from sites where they are non-native, 
rather than introduced directly from areas where they are native (stepping stone invasions).

NIS in the North Pacific 
Three categories of NIS were examined:  a) species native to the North Pacific, b) species non-native to the 
North Pacific but identified as native to other regions in the world, and c) species non-native to the North 
Pacific but whose native range is unknown (henceforth referred to as “origin unknown”). In order to examine 
the transfer of those three categories of NIS across the North Pacific via various vectors, a series of questions 
was addressed: 
 
Question 1.  What proportion of the NIS in the North Pacific has been identified as native vs. non-native to the 
North Pacific, and for what proportion is the origin unknown? 
Question 2.  What regions in the North Pacific represent donor vs. receiving regions for aquatic NIS in the 
North Pacific? 
Question 3.  How many of the species that are non-native to the North Pacific, or with origin unknown, have 
established a) in only one of the regions in the North Pacific, b) in two regions, or c) in all three regions? 
Question 4.  What is the geographic origin (i.e., region where native) of NIS that are non-native to the North 
Pacific?  
Question 5.  By which vectors have different taxa been introduced to different regions in the North Pacific? 
 
The answer to the first question aimed to provide a measure of the relative contribution of the three categories 
of NIS in the North Pacific to the total number of NIS.  The analysis carried out to address the second question 
included only species native to at least one region in the North Pacific.  Questions 3 and 4 focused on species 
that are non-native to the North Pacific, and aimed at assessing how widespread they are within the North 
Pacific and their geographic origin.  The fifth question focused on the relationship between taxa and vectors, 
and aimed at exploring whether a specific taxon has been more frequently introduced to a specific region in the 
North Pacific by a specific vector.

Comparison with other regions 
For the combined dataset, the following questions were addressed: 
 
Question 6.  Are there differences between regions regarding the number of NIS established from different taxa? 
Question 7.  Are there differences between regions regarding the geographic origin (i.e., region where native) 
of NIS from different taxonomic groups? 
Question 8.  In the North Atlantic, which region is a donor vs. receiving region for various taxa? 
Question 9.  Are there differences between regions regarding the vector responsible for introducing different 
taxa? 
Methods 
Dataset 
In order to answer questions 1 to 5, data on population status and native range of NIS in the North Pacific and 
their associated vectors from the NIS database were extracted (Lee II and Reusser, 2012b) using the same 
criteria as for the vector analysis described in the Atlas (Figs. 25–60, Lee II and Reusser, 2012a).  Only species 
identified as NIS in at least one of the three regions in the North Pacific were included in the dataset.  Species 
recorded as “cryptogenic” (i.e., species that are not clearly native or introduced based on current information) 
or “transient”, or “unclassified” (i.e., there was insufficient information to make a judgment as to its origin) in 
a given region were not included in the count of NIS in that region.  Note that a species that has been identified 
as NIS in one region can be cryptogenic, transient or unclassified in another region.  Note also that a given 
species can be non-native to a region where it is also native; this occurs when a species native to one ecoregion 
has established in another ecoregion where it is non-native.  The regions where species were recorded as native 
were identified from the maps in the NIS database.  While the Hawaii ecoregion is part of the Eastern Indo-
Pacific (EIP) region, Hawaii is the only ecoregion in the EIP region that is part of the North Pacific.  To enable 
a comparison of the native range of NIS native to areas inside and outside the North Pacific, Hawaii was 
considered a separate “region” in this analysis. 
 
In order to answer questions 6 to 9, a combined dataset with information on NIS established in the North 
Pacific, the NWA, the NEA, and the Mediterranean was compiled from a range of sources.  In addition to the 
previously exported data from the NIS database (Lee II and Reusser, 2012b), the combined dataset included 
information from other sources in the published literature (Galil, 2009; Gollasch et al., 2009; Gollasch et al., in 
prep.; Ruiz et al., 2000; Streftiaris et al., 2005; Zenetos et al., 2010) and online databases (the National Exotic 
Marine and Estuarine Species Information System (Fofonoff et al., 2003), the Baltic Sea Alien Species 
Database (2007), the CIESM database (The Mediterranean Science Commission, 2002), DAISIE (2008), the 
National Introduced Marine Pest Information System (NIMPIS, 2009), FishBase (Froese and Pauly, 2013), 
SeaLifeBase (Palomares and Pauly, 2013)) as well as data from the NIS database for the three regions in the 
North Atlantic.  We recognize that the compiled dataset may differ in the degree of completeness for different 
taxa and regions, especially regarding the number of NIS in the NWA which is based on the species included 
in the NIS database and the publication by Ruiz et al. (2000).  The native region of the species not included in 
the NIS database was assessed by comparing different sources of information where available. 
NIS in the North Pacific 
The dataset for the North Pacific was divided into three categories: a) species native to the North Pacific,  
b) species identified as native to regions outside of the North Pacific, and c) species of unknown origin.  The 
number of NIS in the three regions was compared and contrasted, and the major donor regions of NIS were 
identified.  The six most important vectors responsible for the introduction of NIS to the North Pacific, as 
identified in the Atlas ( i.e., ballast water, hull fouling, intentional stocking/release, aquaculture escapees, 
aquaculture associated, and aquarium/plant trade) were compared for the following taxonomic groups 
Section 3  Status of NIS 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  21 
(following the Atlas): Cilipohora; Phaeophyceae; Phylum Biliphyta – Rhodophyta; Phylum Viridaeplantae – 
Chlorophyta; Phylum Magnoliophyta; Phylum Porifera; Phylum Platyhelminthes, Phylum Cnidaria – 
Anthozoa, Hydrozoa, and Scyphozoa; Phylum Bryozoa; Phylum Annelida – Clitellata and Polychaeta; Phylum 
Mollusca – Bivalvia and Gastropoda; Phylum Arthropoda, Amphipoda, Isopoda, Musida, Decapoda, 
Copepoda, Cirripeda, Pycnogonida, and Insecta; and Phylum Chordata – Tunicata and Actinopterygii.  As 
these taxonomic groups (subphylum/class/subclass) which make up the larger taxonomic groups Macroalgae, 
Phylum Cnidaria, Phylum Annelida, Phylum Mollusca, Phylum Arthropoda, Phylum Chordata, often show 
different patterns regarding the vector responsible for their introduction, the results for these larger taxonomic 
groups were not included (as it would not be very informative). 
Comparison with other regions 
The comparison of the North Pacific with other regions was done for the following taxonomic groups: 
Mollusca – Bivalvia;  Arthropoda – Cirripeda, Amphipoda, Ispopda, and Decapoda; and Chordata – Tunicata 
and Actinopterygii.  Here, the total number of NIS per region per taxon was compared and contrasted.  For 
each taxon, the native range of the NIS in each region was compared.  While the NIS database includes finer 
scale information on vectors (e.g., ballast water and hull fouling are sub-categories of “shipping”; aquaculture 
associated, intentional stocking/release, aquaculture escapees, aquaculture associated are sub-categories of 
“fishery”), other data sources often indicated only broader categories of vectors such as “shipping” and 
“fishery”.  In the comparison with other regions, only broader categories of vectors responsible for 
introduction of NIS were compared for the six regions: shipping (including both hull fouling and ballast 
water), fishery (including intentional stocking/release, aquaculture escapees, aquaculture associated), shipping 
and fishery (a species has been introduced via both shipping and fishery), other vectors (neither shipping nor 
fishery, e.g., ornamental trade or canals), vector unknown.  Note that the category “other vectors” represents 
species transferred exclusively via vectors other than shipping or fishery, but that many of the species included 
in the categories shipping, fishery, and shipping and fishery may have been introduced/transferred also via 
other vectors.  While the NIS database listed both actual and potential vectors, other sources of information often 
listed only the actual vector responsible for the introduction.  The information on vectors from sources other than 
the NIS database may therefore underestimate the importance of a specific vector for a given species. 
 
Results  
NIS in the North Pacific 
 Number of NIS in the different regions in the North Pacific and their native range 
A total of 746 species were included in the analysis (Table 3.2.1).  Of these, 238 species (or 31.9%) were 
identified as native to the North Pacific, 358 species (or 48.0%) were identified as native to regions outside the 
North Pacific, and 150 species (or 20.1%) were of unknown origin. 
 
Of the 238 species native to the North Pacific, the majority (163 or 68.5%) were native to the NWP, while 63 
species (or 26.5%) were native to the NEP.  Only 3 species (1.3%) were native to Hawaii.  Eight species 
(3.4%) were native to more than two regions, while only 1 species (0.4%) was native to all three regions.  This 
latter species is the brown algae Desmarestia ligulata, which is native to the northernmost ecoregion in the 
NWP but has established non-native populations in the Yellow Sea.

PICES Scientific Report No. 48  23 
In the NWP, with a total of 210 NIS, 55 species (or 26.2%) are native to the North Pacific (Table 3.2.2).  The 
majority of the NIS in this region (133 species or 63.3%) are non-native to the North Pacific, while 22 species 
(or 10.5%) are of unknown origin.  Of the species native to the North Pacific that are NIS in the NWP, the 
majority are native to this region (32 species or 58.2%; this includes the species that are native to the NWP 
only, the NWP and the NEP, and all three regions), while 21 species (or 38.2%) are native to the NEP only 
(Table 3.2.2).  A larger number of the NIS in the NWP are native to the NWP than the number native to the 
NEP.

In Hawaii, with a total of 347 NIS, 89 species (or 25.6%) are native to the North Pacific.  As in the NWP and 
the NEP, the majority of the NIS (176 species or 50.7%) are non-native to the North Pacific, while 82 species 
(or 23.6%) are of unknown origin.  Of the species native the North Pacific that are NIS in Hawaii, the majority 
are native to the NWP only (46 species or 51.7%) while 40 species (or 44.9%) are native to the NEP only.  
Only 1 species (or 1.1%) is native to Hawaii. 
 
In the NEP, with a total of 368 NIS, 122 species (or 33.2%) are native to the North Pacific.  The majority of 
the NIS in this region (179 species or 48.6%) are non-native to the North Pacific, while 67 species (or 18.2%) 
are of unknown origin.  Of the species native to the North Pacific that are NIS in the NEP, the majority are 
native to the NWP only (109 species or 89.3%), while 13 species (or 10.7%) are native to the NEP (this 
includes the species that are native to the NEP only, the NWP and the NEP, and all three regions). 
 
The majority of the NIS in all three regions are non-native to the North Pacific.  Of the species native to the 
North Pacific that have been identified as NIS in the North Pacific, the majority of the NIS in all three regions 
are native to the NWP.  Thus, the NWP is a major source region for NIS not only to the NEP and Hawaii, but 
also to the NWP.  This is a result of the transfer of species within the NWP region to ecoregions where they are 
not native.  However, relatively few of the NIS in the NEP and Hawaii are native to these same regions.  The 
NEP is an important source region for NIS to the NWP and Hawaii, while relatively few NIS native to Hawaii 
have established in the NWP and NEP. 
 Geographic origin of the NIS non-native to the North Pacific 
Of the species non-native to the North Pacific (Table 3.2.1), the majority (257 species or 71.8%) had 
established in only one region, 72 species (20.1%) had established in two regions, and 29 (7.8%) had 
established in all three regions. 
 
Of the species with unknown origin, the majority (132 species or 88.0%) had established in only one region, 
15 species (10.0%) had established in two regions, and 3 species (2.0%) had established in all three regions.

In the NWP, the NW Atlantic and the NE Atlantic are the two dominating source regions, with 50 species (or 
37.6%) and 51 species (or 38.3%) of the NIS non-native to the North Pacific being native to these regions 
(Fig. 3.2.5).  Two other regions appear as important source regions: the W Tropical Atlantic and the 
Mediterranean, each with 38 native species (28.6%) being NIS in the North Pacific.  Although the NWP is 
neighbouring the Central Indo-Pacific, with 14 NIS in the NWP being native to both regions, the Central Indo-
Pacific does not appear as an important source region for NIS to the NWP.  Only 16 species native to the 
Central Indo-Pacific (but non-native the NWP) have established in the NWP.  (This could be a result of under 
reporting). 
 
 
 
Fig. 3.2.5 Regions where the NIS in the Northwest Pacific (NWP) are native.  The graph shows three categories of NIS: 
Those native to the NWP, those native to the other two regions in the North Pacific, and those non-native to the North 
Pacific.  Many species are native to more than one region, and the sum of the number of species native to the different 
regions is therefore, larger than the total number of NIS in the NWP.  The graph illustrates the geographic extent of the 
native range of the NIS in the NWP, e.g., many of the species native to the NWP are also native to the Central Indo-
Pacific, while many of the species native to the NEP are also native to the Tropical Eastern Pacific. 
 
 
In Hawaii, the Central Indo-Pacific is the most important source region for NIS, with only one species being 
native to both regions.  However, many of the NIS native to the Central Indo-Pacific are also native to the 
NWP and/or the NEP, which are also important source regions.  Other important source regions are the Indian 
Ocean, the W Tropical Atlantic, and the NW Atlantic (Fig. 3.2.6). 
 
In the NEP, the NWP appears as the largest source region, with 113 species native to the NWP having 
established in the NEP.  Of the species non-native to the North Pacific, the majority of the NIS are native to the 
NW Atlantic (99 species or 55.3%).  Three other regions appear as important source regions: the W Tropical 
Atlantic (36.3%), the NE Atlantic (32.4%), and the Mediterranean (21.2%) (Fig. 3.2.7). 
 
Thus, the four most important source regions for NIS to the NWP and NEP from regions outside the North 
Pacific are the same.  They are all in the North Atlantic, but their order of importance is different in the NWP 
and the NEP.  For NIS in Hawaii, the Central Indo-Pacific and the Indian Ocean appear to be more important 
source regions.  The NE Atlantic and the Mediterranean, both important source regions for NIS in the NWP 
and NEP, are less important as source regions for NIS in Hawaii.

Fig. 3.2.6 Regions where the NIS in Hawaii are native.  The graph shows three categories of NIS: Those native to 
Hawaii, those native to the other two regions in the North Pacific, and those non-native to the North Pacific.  Many species 
are native to more than one region, and the sum of the number of species native to the different regions is therefore, larger 
than the total number of NIS in the Hawaii.  The graph illustrates the geographic extent of the native range of the NIS in 
Hawaii, e.g., the NIS in Hawaii are dominated by species native to the Central Indo-Pacific, many of which are also native 
to the NWP and the NEP.

Those native to the NEP, those native to the other two regions in the North Pacific, and those non-native to the North 
Pacific.  Many species are native to more than one region, and the sum of the number of species native to the different 
regions is therefore, larger than the total number of NIS in the NEP.  The graph illustrates the geographic extent of the 
native range of the NIS in the NEP, e.g., many of the NIS in the NEP are native to the NWP as well as the Central Indo-
Pacific.

 Vectors responsible for the introduction of NIS in the North Pacific 
Of all the NIS in the North Pacific, 87.9% are transferred by the six most important vectors (listed in Fig. 60 in 
the Atlas; Lee II and Reusser, 2012a; Table 3.2.3).  Note that one species can be introduced by multiple 
vectors, and the sum of the number of species in a given taxon transferred by individual vectors (see Fig. 3.2.8) 
can therefore be larger than the total number of species transferred by all those vectors together.
2
  The six most 
important vectors account for the transfer of ≥80% of the NIS from most taxonomic groups, with the exception 
of brown algae, Magnoliophyta, Isopoda, and Insecta (Table 3.2.3 and Fig. 3.2.8).  For Clitellata, solid ballast 
is also an important vector (accounting for 71.4% of the introductions).  For Magnoliophyta, habitat restoration 
is an important vector (accounting for 63.6% of the introductions).  For the insects, no vector of introduction is 
known for 46.7% of the species. 
 
Most taxonomic groups follow similar patterns regarding the vectors that are responsible for their introduction.  
However, bivalves show differences between regions, with hull fouling being a more important vector in 
Hawaii than the NWP and NEP (Fig. 3.2.8n).  For decapods, intentional stocking appears to be a more 
important vector in NWP than in the other regions (Fig. 3.2.8s).  For ray-finned fishes, intentional stocking and 
aquaculture escapees are more important vectors for introduction in the NWP than in Hawaii and the NEP 
(Fig. 3.2.8y).

 Example: Of the 26 species of Rhodophyta transferred by the six most important vectors, 11 are transferred via ballast 
water, 20 via hull fouling, 7 via intentional stocking/release, and 14 via aquaculture associated. 
 
 
Table 3.2.3 Number of NIS from different taxonomic groups in the North Pacific and associated regions transferred by the six major vectors: ballast water, hull fouling, 
intentional stocking/release, aquaculture escapees, aquaculture associated, and aquarium/plant trade.  Where there are differences between the number of NIS spread by 
the six major vectors and the total number of NIS, vectors other than the six major vectors are important, or the vector is unknown.

Comparisons with other regions 
 Number of NIS from seven major taxonomic groups and their geographic origin 
The Mediterranean had the highest total number of NIS from the seven taxonomic groups (318 species), 
followed by the NEP (137 species), Hawaii (134 species), the NWP (105 species), and the NEA (84 species).  
The NWA had the lowest number of NIS (71 species) (Fig. 3.2.9).  
 
 
 
Fig. 3.2.9 Total number of NIS from seven taxonomic groups in the regions in the North Pacific and the North Atlantic. 
 
A) Bivalves 
The highest number of non-native bivalve species was recorded in the Mediterranean (77 species), more than 
three times that of any other region, with the Indian Ocean being the major donor region (Appendix 3, Table  
A3.1).  Hawaii and the NEP both had 22 non-native bivalve species, and the NWP had 21, with the Central 
Indo-Pacific being a major donor region of species to Hawaii, and the NWP and the Central Indo-Pacific being 
major donor regions of species to the NEP.  The NEA and the NWA had the lowest number of non-native 
bivalve species (18 and 15 species, respectively).  A higher number of bivalve species native to the NWA had 
established in the NEA (6 species) and the Mediterranean (5 species) than vice versa (2 species native to the 
NEA, one of these also native to the Mediterranean, had established in the NWA).  
B) Amphipods 
The highest number of non-native amphipod species was recorded in the NEP (37 species), with the NWP and 
the NWA being the major donor regions (11 species each) and many amphipod species of unknown origin 
(Appendix 3, Table A3.2).  Hawaii had 20 species of non-native amphipod species, the NEA 17 species.  Few 
non-native amphipod species were found in the Mediterranean (8 species), the NWP (7 species) and the NWA 
(5 species).  Two amphipod species native to the NWA had established in the NEA, while one species from the 
NEA and one species from the Mediterranean had established in the NWA. 
Section 3  Status of NIS 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  33 
C) Isopods 
The highest number of non-native isopod species was recorded in Hawaii (21 species) and the NEP (20 species), 
followed by the NWA (10 species) and the Mediterranean (7 species) (Appendix 3, Table A3.3).  The lowest 
numbers of non-native isopod species were recorded in the NEA (5 species) and the NWP (4 species).  There 
were no apparent donor regions for this taxon.  No isopods native to the NWA had established in the NEA or the 
Mediterranean, while 3 species native to the NEA and 2 the Mediterranean, have established in the NWA.  
D) Decapods 
The Mediterranean had the highest number of non-native decapod species (73 species) more than four times 
than any other region, with the Indian Ocean being the major donor region (Appendix 3, Table A3.4).  The 
NWP, the NWA and the NEA had 16 non-native decapod species each with no apparent donor region, Hawaii 
had 10 species (most native to the Central Indo-Pacific) and the NEP had 5 species.  A higher number of 
decapod species native to the NWA had established in the NEA (5 species) and the Mediterranean (6 species) 
than vice versa (1 species native to both NEA and the Mediterranean had established in the NWA).  Four 
species native to the NEA had established in the Mediterranean, but no species native to the Mediterranean had 
established in the NEA. 
E) Barnacles 
The NWP had the highest number of non-native barnacle species (11 species) followed by the NEA  
(10 species), the NWA and the Mediterranean (8 species each), and the NEP (5 species) (Appendix 3, Table 
A3.5).  Hawaii had the lowest number of non-native barnacle species (4 species).  There were no apparent 
donor regions for this taxon.  While no barnacle species native to the NEA and the Mediterranean had 
established in other regions in the North Atlantic, species native to the NWA had established in the NEA (2 
species) and the Mediterranean (3 species). 
F) Tunicates 
Hawaii had the highest number of non-native tunicate species (29 species), with the Central Indo-Pacific being 
the major donor region, and many species of unknown origin (Appendix 3, Table A3.6).  The NEP had 23 species 
of non-native tunicates, with the NWP and the Central Indo-Pacific being major donor regions.  Many of the  
23 species of non-native tunicates in the Mediterranean were native to the Central Indo-Pacific, and many were of 
unknown origin.  The other three regions had similar numbers of non-native tunicate species:  NWP (10 species), 
NWA (10 species) and NEA (11 species) with no apparent donor regions.  There was no apparent pattern of 
transfer of tunicate species across the Atlantic, with only 1–2 species transferred between each region. 
G) Ray-finned fishes 
The Mediterranean had the highest number of non-native ray-finned fishes (122 species), with the majority of 
the species being native to the Indian Ocean (Appendix 3 Table A3.7).  The NWP had the second highest 
number of non-native ray-finned fishes (34 species), with the NWA being a major donor region.  Hawaii and 
the NEP followed with 28 and 25 non-native species, respectively. The majority of the non-native fishes in 
Hawaii were native to the Central Indo-Pacific while the majority of the non-native ray-finned fishes in the 
NEP were native to the NW Atlantic.  There were few non-native ray-finned fishes in the NWA and NEA.  
Regarding the transfer of ray-finned fished across the North Atlantic, a high number of species native to the 
NWA and the NEA had established in the Mediterranean (22 and 20 species, respectively) while few species 
native to the Mediterranean had established in NWA and NEA (3 and 1 species, respectively).  Twelve species 
native to the NWA had established in the NWP and 2 species native to the NWP had established in the NWA.  
 
Thus, the number of NIS from any of these seven taxonomic groups in a given region is highly variable.  
While the Mediterranean has the highest number of non-native species of bivalves, decapods, and ray-finned 
fishes, the NWP has the highest number of non-native species of barnacles, the NEP has the highest number of 
non-native species of amphipods, and Hawaii has the highest number of non-native species of isopods and 
tunicates. 
Status of NIS  Section 3 
34  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
The importance of different donor regions also varies across taxa and regions.  While the Central Indo-Pacific 
is a major donor region for NIS to the Mediterranean as well as to Hawaii (see Fig. 3.2.6 for Hawaii), of the 
seven taxonomic groups contrasted and compared here, it is a donor region mainly for bivalves and ray-finned 
fishes (to both regions), decapods (to the Mediterranean), and tunicates (to Hawaii). 
 
Regarding the transfer across the North Atlantic from the NWA to the regions in the northeastern Atlantic (the 
NEA and the Mediterranean) and vice versa, the “direction of the flow” varies across taxa.  For bivalves, 
decapods, and barnacles, a higher number of species native to the NWA has established in the northeastern 
regions than vice versa.  For Isopods, the NWA has received species native to the regions in the northeastern 
Atlantic.  For amphipods, tunicates, and ray-finned fish there was no dominating direction in the transfer of 
species.  
 Vectors responsible for introducing NIS to the different regions 
Shipping, often together with fishery, was the major vector for the introduction of bivalves to most regions 
(Fig. 3.2.10a).  In Hawaii, most introductions were attributed to shipping alone.  In the NWP, fishery alone 
was the major vector.  In the Mediterranean, nearly half of all non-native bivalves had been introduced via 
other vectors, mainly through the Suez Canal.  
 
The introductions of amphipods to all six regions were attributed mainly to shipping, often together with 
fishery (Fig. 3.2.10b).  In the NEA, a third of the introductions were attributed to fishing only. 
 
Shipping alone was the major vector for the introduction of isopods to all six regions. Shipping together with 
fishery contributed to a small proportion of the introductions in all regions except the NWP and the 
Mediterranean (Fig. 3.2.10c).  In the NEP and the Mediterranean a small number of introductions were 
attributed to vectors other than shipping and fishery. 
 
Fishery alone was the major vector for the introduction of most non-native decapods established in the NWP, 
NWA, and the NEA (Fig. 3.2.10d).  Shipping alone was the major vector for introductions to Hawaii.  Most 
non-native decapods in the Mediterranean had been introduced through the Suez Canal. 
 
Shipping together with fishery was a major vector for the introduction of barnacles to all regions 
(Fig. 3.2.10e).  Fishery alone was responsible for a small number of species in the NWA and the NEA.  In the 
Mediterranean, the introduction of a low number of species was attributed vectors other than shipping and 
fishery. 
 
Shipping, often together with fishery, was the major vector for the introduction of tunicates in all regions 
(Fig. 3.2.10f).  However, in Hawaii most introductions of tunicates were attributed to shipping only.  In the 
Mediterranean, the vector responsible for the introduction of a third of the species was unknown.

Fishery alone was the major vector responsible for the introduction of ray-finned fishes in all six regions, 
except for the Mediterranean, where the majority of species had been introduced through the Suez Canal  
(Fig. 3.2.10g). 
 
The importance of a particular vector thus varies across taxa and regions.  While shipping is an important 
vector for introductions of NIS across most taxa, shipping alone (i.e., introductions that are not also attributed 
to fishery) is the dominating vector only for the introductions of amphipods and isopods.  Few introductions, 
other than those of ray-finned fishes, have been attributed to fishery alone. For the introduction of ray-finned 
fishes, shipping plays only a minor role.  In Hawaii, shipping alone is the dominating vector of introduction for 
most taxa, with the exception of ray-finned fishes and barnacles.  In the NWP, most bivalve introductions are 
attributed to fishery, as a result of intentional introductions.  In the NEA, many amphipod introductions are 
also a result of intentional introductions (stocking). 
Discussion and conclusions 
Answers to the questions posed earlier in subsection 3.2.2 NIS in the North Pacific are provided below.  
NIS in the North Pacific 
Answer to question 1.  What proportion of the NIS in the North Pacific has been identified as native vs. non-
native to the North Pacific, and for what proportion is the origin unknown? 
Of the 746 NIS in the North Pacific, about a third of the species (238 species or 31.9%) are native to another 
region or ecoregion in the North Pacific.  Almost half (358 species or 48.0%) of the NIS have been identified 
as native to regions outside of the North Pacific, while one fifth (150 species or 20.1%) of the NIS are non-
native to the North Pacific but their native region is unknown. 
 
Answer to question 2.  What regions in the North Pacific represent donor vs. receiving regions for aquatic NIS 
in the North Pacific? 
The Northwest Pacific is a major donor region of NIS native to the North Pacific and transferred to other 
ecoregions and regions within the North Pacific.  Not only is the NWP a donor region of NIS to the NEP and 
Hawaii, but many species native to the NWP have been transferred to other ecoregions in the NWP where they 
are not native.  In the NEP, the region with the highest overall number of NIS (with 368 species in total, 122 of 
these are native to the North Pacific), 109 of these are native to the NWP only.  In Hawaii (with 347 NIS, 89 of 
these native to the North Pacific) more than half (or 46 species) are native to the NWP only while 45% (or 40 
species) are native to the NEP only.  The NWP has the lowest total number of NIS (210 species, 55 of these 
native to the North Pacific), with 28 species native to the NWP. 
Section 3  Status of NIS 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  37 
Answer to question 3.  How many of the species that are non-native to the North Pacific, or with origin 
unknown, have established a) in only one of the regions in the North Pacific, b) in two regions, or c) in all 
three regions? 
The majority of the NIS in the North Pacific that are native to regions outside the North Pacific have 
established in only one region in the North Pacific (389 of the 508 species non-native to the North Pacific) and 
are thus not very widespread.  17% of the species have established in two regions, while only 6% have 
established in all three regions.  
 
Answer to question 4.  What is the geographic origin (i.e., region where native) of NIS that are non-native to 
the North Pacific?  
Four regions in the Atlantic are important source regions for NIS to the NWP and the NEP, namely the NW 
Atlantic, the W Tropical Atlantic, the NE Atlantic, and the Mediterranean.  The Central Indo-Pacific and the 
Indian Ocean appear as more important donor regions for NIS to Hawaii.   
 
Answer to question 5.  By which vectors have different taxa been introduced to different regions in the North 
Pacific? 
While most taxonomic groups show similar patterns regarding the vectors that are responsible for their 
introduction, there are substantial differences across taxa.  The six most important vectors (ballast water, hull 
fouling, intentional stocking/release, aquaculture escapees, aquaculture associated, and aquarium/plant trade) 
account for the transfer of ≥80% of the NIS from most taxonomic groups, with the exception of brown algae, 
Magnoliophyta, Isopoda, and Insecta.  Solid ballast is also an important vector for Clitellata, while habitat 
restoration is an important vector for Magnoliophyta.  For insects, no vector of introduction is known for nearly 
half of the species.  For some taxa, there are regional differences regarding the importance of different vectors.  
For bivalves, hull fouling is a more important vector in Hawaii than in the NWP and NEP.  For decapods, 
intentional stocking appears to be a more important vector in NWP than in the other regions.  For ray-finned 
fishes, intentional stocking and aquaculture escapees are more important vectors for introduction in all three 
regions of the North Pacific, but they are even more important in the NWP than in Hawaii and the NEP. 
Comparison with other regions 
Answer to question 6.  Are there differences between regions regarding the number of NIS established from 
different taxa? 
There are differences across regions regarding the number of NIS established from the seven taxonomic groups 
that were examined.  While the Mediterranean has the highest number of non-native bivalves, decapods, and 
ray-finned fishes, the NWP has the highest number of non-native barnacles, the NEP has the highest number of 
non-native amphipods, and Hawaii has the highest number of non-native isopods and tunicates. 
 
Answer to question 7.  Are there differences between regions regarding the geographic origin (i.e., region 
where native) of NIS from different taxonomic groups? 
The importance of different donor regions varies across taxa and regions, but there were clear patterns only for 
some of the six regions and seven taxa examined.  The western Indo-Pacific is generally a major donor region 
for NIS to the Mediterranean, but only for bivalves, decapods, and ray-finned fishes.  The Central Indo-Pacific 
is a major donor region for NIS to Hawaii, but only for bivalves, tunicates, and ray-finned fishes. 
 
Answer to question 8.  In the North Atlantic, which region is a donor vs. receiving region for various taxa? 
Regarding the transfer of species across the North Atlantic (i.e., from the NWA to the NEA and the 
Mediterranean, and vice versa), which region that is the donor or receiving region varies across taxa.  The 
NWA appears as a donor region for bivalves, decapods, and barnacles, as a higher number of species native to 
the NWA has established in the northeastern regions than vice versa.  For isopods, the NWA has received 
Status of NIS  Section 3 
38  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
species native to the regions in the northeastern Atlantic.  For amphipods, tunicates, and ray-finned fishes there 
was no dominating direction in the transfer of species. 
 
Answer to question 9.  Are there differences between regions regarding the vector responsible for introducing 
different taxa? 
While shipping is generally considered an important vector for the introduction of NIS from most taxa around 
the world, the importance of different vectors varies across taxa and regions.  In the six regions examined, 
shipping is the dominating vector for the introduction of isopods, amphipods, barnacles and tunicates, for the 
latter three taxa often in combination with fishery (aquaculture associated).  In the NEA, many amphipod 
introductions are also a result of intentional introductions (stocking).  Shipping plays only a minor role for the 
introduction of ray-finned fishes, with most introductions being attributed to fishery alone. However, in the 
Mediterranean, with the highest number of ray-finned fishes, most introductions are the result of migration 
through the Suez Canal.  Shipping and fishery are both important vectors for the introduction of bivalves and 
decapods.  However, in the NWP, most bivalve introductions are attributed to fishery alone, while shipping is 
more important in the Mediterranean.  In Hawaii, shipping alone is the dominating vector of introduction for 
most taxa, with the exception of ray-finned fishes.

4 Capacity Building:  Training and Outreach 
4.1 North Pacific Marine Non-Indigenous Aquatic Species Taxonomy 
Initiative 
Within the context of the PICES project on the “Development of the prevention systems for harmful 
organisms’ expansion in the Pacific Rim”, the primary objectives of the Taxonomy Initiative were to: 
1. Develop training opportunities to improve capacity with respect to NIS, with an emphasis on capacity 
building in developing countries; 
2. Develop and improve collaboration on NIS among PICES member countries and between PICES and 
other international organizations; and  
3. Develop tools that will allow open and transparent sharing of information both within PICES and beyond. 
 
The Taxonomy Initiative, generously funded by MAFF, focused on rapid assessment surveys for native and 
non-native species in a variety of habitats in commercial ports of PICES member countries, and on a collector 
survey to characterize the distribution of fouling organisms at a number of locations in each PICES member 
country. 
4.1.1 NIS collaborations and Rapid Assessment Surveys 
Given the continued exchange of species globally by various introduction vectors, especially species 
redistributions around the North Pacific, it is important to establish collaborations among taxonomists and 
invasion biologists on both sides of the Pacific Ocean in order to truly understand species’ distribution patterns 
and hence invasion patterns. To foster collaborations among NIS researchers, a series of four PICES Rapid 
Assessment Surveys (RAS) was conducted with the help of local hosts (Table 4.1.1).

A standardized data collection protocol was developed for the RAS. A description is provided in Appendix 4. 
This protocol, which outlines the methodologies that should be used to carry out a RAS, is useful for 
monitoring programs to detect newly arriving species. In addition, dissemination and outreach of the 
Capacity Building  Section 4 
40  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
developed protocol and database framework to developing countries will help them in addressing NIS issues. 
(This is described in subsection 4.1.2 Demonstration workshops). 
 
RAS are one approach to quickly characterize the native, non-native, and cryptogenic species present in 
different locations.  These are qualitative surveys that allow rapid depiction of the species composition within 
each location surveyed, not the abundance of any specific species. Quantitative surveys to estimate population 
sizes could be done subsequently, if needed, but are too time consuming for rapid assessments.  Although 
specific methods vary slightly, based on habitats being sampled or taxonomic groups being characterized,  
WG 21 has developed methodologies that have been used within PICES member countries to identify non-
indigenous species in both intertidal and subtidal habitats. 
 
For the PICES project, commercial ports in PICES member countries were surveyed as ports have a greater 
probability of containing non-indigenous species (see number of NIS associated with shipping above).  The 
surveys focused on two major port ecosystem components, namely intertidal and subtidal habitats.  The 
rational for surveying ports is that not only do these locations serve as a recipient environment for organisms 
transported by commercial shipping (ballast water, ballast sediment, hull fouling), they also often have high 
levels of secondary traffic (e.g., recreational or small craft, aquaculture transfers) and tend to be more 
disturbed than natural environments, a factor that could enhance invasion success.  
 
Data from each of the surveys has been archived in the PICES WG 21 NIS database of marine and estuarine 
species.  Complete details of each survey can be found in a series of issues of the PICES Press newsletter (see 
Appendix 7). Brief summaries from these articles are provided below. 
 
PICES Press Vol. 17, No. 1  
The first article (pp. 30–32) provides a summary of the preliminary results from the first RAS conducted in 
Dalian, China, in 2008.  Two commercial ports were targeted in this RAS: Dalian on the Yellow Sea and Bayu 
Quan on the Bohai Sea.  Samples were collected and processed by the international team of participants who 
also carried out species identification and classification (native, non-native, cryptogenic).  Three species (all 
bivalve molluscs) were classified as non-indigenous.  In addition, the article outlines the objectives, rationale, 
and goals for carrying out an RAS, together with a summary of the methodology used.  The role of the RAS as 
a forum for taxonomic experts from the American and Asian sides of the Pacific to discuss the organisms 
encountered, share knowledge, and compare sampling methods is discussed. 
 
PICES Press Vol. 18, No. 1  
The second article (pp. 38–40) provides a summary of the preliminary results from the second RAS in 2009.  
In this survey collector plates had been deployed at different locations within each of the following Korean 
ports: Busan, Masan, Jangmok, and Ulsan the summer prior to the PICES Annual Meeting.  The collector 
plates where subsequently processed in Jeju, the week prior to the Meeting by the international team of 
participants.  Four species were classified as non-indigenous: one bivalve mollusc, one cirriped, one amphipod 
and one polychaete. 
 
PICES Press Vol. 19, No. 1  
The third article (pp. 27–29) provides a summary of the preliminary results from the third RAS conducted in 
Newport, Oregon, USA, in 2010.  In this RAS, intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats of two Oregon estuaries 
(Coos Bay and Yaquina Bay) were sampled using collectors, traps, scrapings, and by diver collections.  A 
seawater reservoir tank at the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Yaquina Bay was drained and sampled for 
fouling organisms. Classification of species as native, non-native or cryptogenic occurred following species 
identification by RAS team members.  Fourteen species were classified as non-indigenous: four algae, six 
ascidians, three polychaetes, and one crustacean. 
  
Section 4  Capacity Building 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  41 
PICES Press Vol. 20, No. 1  
The fourth article (pp. 26–29) provides a summary of the preliminary results from the fourth RAS conducted in 
Peter the Great Bay and Vostok Bay, near Vladivostok and Nakhodka, Russia. As the previous year’s RAS in 
Newport was particularly successful for polychaetes, small crustaceans, and marine algae, it was decided to 
focus on these groups again in 2011.  In this RAS, most of the sampling was conducted in and around Vostok 
Bay in a range of habitats (small harbors, rocky points, mud flats).  Collector plates were deployed for about 5 
months prior to the RAS.  Two sets of these plates were recovered from Vostok Bay harbors and one from the 
international harbor in Vladivostok.  
 
Collecting standardized RAS data allowed distinction of native, non-indigenous and cryptogenic species, and 
comparisons of invasions within and among countries.  Through these surveys, we now have a much better 
understanding of the invasion patterns of several taxonomic groups, including algae, amphipods, polychaetes 
(worms), and ascidians (tunicates or sea squirts).  The surveys also provided collaboration opportunities for a 
number of countries and participants.  These established contacts and networks will serve as a lasting legacy of 
the project. 
4.1.2 Demonstration workshops 
Given the global nature of biological invasions, it is critical to engage those working on this important topic 
outside of PICES’ six member countries, especially those locations adjacent to the PICES region where the 
potential transport of NIS is expected to be high, such as Southeast Asia.  One way to share information on 
invaders and build capacity to better understand invasion dynamics and maintain safe and productive marine 
ecosystems is to hold demonstration workshops to provide participants with the tools needed to conduct their 
own surveys.  As NIS continue to be a priority research topic for two other regional intergovernmental 
organizations, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission’s Sub-Commission for the Western Pacific 
(WESTPAC) and Northwest Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP), PICES worked with these two organizations in 
preparing the workshops.  Specifically, three demonstration workshops on “Rapid assessment survey 
methodologies for non-indigenous species” were hosted during the project (Table 4.1.2).  Over 50 participants 
from China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam received 
training. 
 
Each workshop aimed to: 
1. Provide hands-on training to researchers concerned about the potential introduction of NIS, especially 
those from developing countries; 
2. Introduce participants to the PICES NIS database (and later Atlas); and 
3. Foster collaboration between PICES and WESTPAC, NOWPAP, and interested researchers, especially 
those within developing countries. 
 
During the demonstration workshops, a full PICES RAS was not carried out. The workshops provided 
participants with general information about NIS and why vigilance and being proactive is required, using a 
series of short lectures, hands-on experience in making field collections in a variety of coastal environments, 
and laboratory experience using keys and reference material to identify organisms collected.  In addition, 
workshop participants were introduced to the developed NIS database which provides one means to enhance 
communication on NIS around the Pacific Ocean and beyond.  Details of the first two workshops can be found 
in PICES Press (Appendix 7). Details of the third (and final) workshop in Nagasaki, Japan, have not been 
published.

PICES Press Vol. 19, No. 1  
The first demonstration workshop (pp. 30–31) was held at the Marine Station of Kobe University’s Center for 
Inland Seas, Awai Island, Japan, in 2010.  Participants were invited to learn about PICES activities on non-
indigenous marine species and to receive training in Rapid Assessment Survey techniques.  The workshop 
exposed participants to (1) a background about marine non-indigenous species and why vigilance is required, 
using a series of short lectures, (2) hands-on experience in making field collections in a variety of coastal 
environments, and (3) laboratory experience using keys and reference material to identify the organisms 
collected. Since the workshop focused on background and techniques, actual taxonomic experts were not 
utilized in this demonstration.  Workshop participants visited a number of sites around Osaka Bay where they 
were shown techniques to sample a variety of different habitats, received training in the application of collector 
plates, and thereafter identified and classified the collected samples.  The participants were also introduced to 
the PICES NIS database.  Due to the overwhelmingly positive feedback from workshop participants, with 
many participants eager to initiate aspects of RAS within their home countries, it was decided to hold a larger 
demonstration workshop in 2011 in Thailand. 
 
PICES Press Vol. 20, No. 1  
The second demonstration workshop (pp. 30–31) was held at the Phuket Marine Biological Center, Phuket, 
Thailand, in 2011.  This workshop followed the same format as the workshop held the previous year. The 
participants were exposed to techniques for sampling a variety of different habitats around the Center right on 
the Andaman Sea. 
 
Overall, this project has allowed for capacity building in non-PICES member countries and has strengthened 
linkages with both WESTPAC and NOWPAP on NIS research. See an outreach brochure developed as one of 
WG 21’s final products (Appendix 5).

4.2 Database Training Workshop 
The initial database training workshop for WG 21 members was held in March 2008, in Busan, Korea.  Since 
2009, training on the functions and utility of using the NIS database has been provided to PICES member 
countries during WG 21 meetings at each PICES Annual Meeting.  Technology transfer workshops were 
conducted for the participants of the joint PICES/ICES meeting held in conjunction with the Fifth Marine 
Bioinvasions Conference (May 2007, Boston, USA) and RAS demonstration workshops (Table 4.1.2).  
Individual database training was also provided at the Sixth Marine Bioinvasions Conference (August 2009, 
Portland, USA) and at PICES Annual Meetings. 
 
Posters and/or presentations on the utility, framework and data available in the NIS database and Atlas were 
given at PICES Annual Meetings in Dalian, China (2008), Jeju, Korea (2009), Portland, USA (2010), and 
Khabarovsk, Russia (2011); and at the meetings of the Estuarine Research Society in Oregon, USA (2010 and 
2012), Pacific Estuarine Research Society in Oregon, USA (2010), and Coastal and Estuarine Research 
Foundation in Florida, USA (2011).  The NIS database and Atlas were also presented at a WESTPAC 
(Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission’s Sub-Commission for the Western Pacific) workshop on 
non-indigenous species in 2009 in Bangkok, Thailand.  The database was also presented at the RAS 
demonstration workshops in Phuket, Thailand (2011) and in Nagasaki, Japan (2012). 
 
 
  
Section 5  Prevention and Mitigation Measures 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  45 
5 Initiatives on Prevention and Mitigation Measures 
5.1 ICES Code of Practice on the Introductions and Transfers of Marine 
Organisms 2005 
The ICES Code of Practice on the Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms (the “Code of Practice”) 
was adopted in 1973.  The Code of Practice was developed by ICES in collaboration with the European Inland 
Fisheries Advisory Commission (EIFAC), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
(FAO). Since 1973, the Code of Practice has evolved following repeated modifications and updates, most 
recently in 2005. 
 
While the Code of Practice was originally designed for the ICES member countries concerned with the North 
Atlantic and adjacent seas, all countries across the globe are encouraged to implement it.  
 
The Code sets forth recommended procedures and practices to reduce the risks of adverse effects arising from 
intentional introductions and transfers of marine (including brackish water) organisms.  It applies to the 
movement and translocation of non-native species for fisheries enhancement and marine aquaculture purposes 
and to introductions done for re-stocking and enhancement purposes.  The Code also recommends procedures 
to reduce the risk of unwanted introductions of species that can accidentally be released into the wild, 
including species that are part of live trade (e.g., species used for aquaria, ornamentals, bait, and food), species 
that are introduced and transferred for research purposes, biocontrol, genetically modified organisms, and 
polyploids. 
 
The Code of Practice addresses three levels of concern associated with introductions and transfers of non-
indigenous species.  The first concern is that introduced and transferred species may escape cultivation and 
become established in the receiving environment where they can have an impact on native species and the 
receiving environment.  The second concern is the potential genetic impact of introduced and transferred 
species relative to the mixing of farmed and wild stocks as well as to the release of genetically modified 
organisms.  The third concern is the risk of inadvertently introducing harmful organisms (pathogens, parasites, 
and other “fellow travellers”) associated with the target species. 
 
The Code outlines a consistent transparent process for the evaluation of a proposed new introduction, including 
detailed biological background information and evaluation of risks.  The Code is presented in a manner that 
permits broad and flexible application to a wide range of circumstances and requirements in many different 
countries, while at the same time adhering to a set of basic scientific principles and guidelines. 
 
The Code is divided into ten sections of recommendations relating to: (I) a strategy for implementation, (II) the 
steps to take prior to introducing a new species, (III) the steps to take after deciding to proceed with an 
introduction, (IV) policies for ongoing introductions or transfers which have been an established part of 
commercial practice, (V–VII) the steps to take prior to releasing genetically modified organisms, and (VIII–X) 
the steps to take prior to releasing polyploidy organisms. 
 
ICES member countries contemplating new introductions are requested to present to the Council a detailed 
prospectus on the rationale and plans for any new introduction of a marine (and brackish water) species. The 
ICES Working Group on Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms may thereafter be requested by the 
Council to consider the prospectus and comment on it.  The Working Group may request more information 
Prevention and Mitigation Measures  Section 5 
46  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
before commenting on a proposal. If an introduction or transfer proceeds following approval, the ICES 
member country is requested to keep the Council informed by providing details of the broodstock established 
and the fate of the progeny via progress reports after a species is released into the wild.  
 
The text of the ICES Code can be found at http://info.ices.dk/pubs/Miscellaneous/Codeofpractice.asp. 
 
In Canada, a formal review process is in place to evaluate the risk of introductions of harmful NIS associated 
with introductions and transfers. The national process is described in Section 5.4 National Policy and 
Legislation Targeting Non-native Aquatic Species in PICES Member Countries.  
 
Section 5  Prevention and Mitigation Measures 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  47 
5.2 IMO International Convention for the Control and Management of 
Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments 
5.2.1 Conditions for the Convention coming into force 
In 2004, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted the International Convention for the Control 
and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments. The Convention has not yet come into force.  In 
order for it to come into force, it must be ratified by at least 30 countries representing at least 35% of the 
world’s tonnage. It is currently (as of March 2014) ratified by 38 countries representing 30.38% of the world’s 
tonnage. The Convention will come into force one year after the conditions are met. 
5.2.2 Which ships the standards apply to  
The Convention applies to all vessel types operating in the aquatic environment which are designed to carry 
ballast water and are entitled to fly the flag of a Party to the Convention. This includes submersibles, floating 
craft and platforms, including floating storage units and floating production storage and offloading units. The 
Convention calls for ships to conduct a ballast water exchange or to meet a concentration-based ballast water 
discharge standard in accordance with a gradually implemented schedule linked to the year the ship was 
constructed (< 2009; in 2009; > 2009) and the amount of ballast carried on board the ship (< 1,500 m
3
; ≥ 1,500 
m
3
 or ≤ 5,000 m
3
; ≥ 5,000 m
3
). 
5.2.3 What the standards are 
The Convention includes two regulations that define ballast water management standards: Regulation D-1 
addresses the Ballast Water Exchange standard and Regulation D-2 details the Ballast Water Treatment 
Performance standard.  
 
Ships performing ballast water exchange (Regulation D-1) are required to do so with an efficiency of at least 
95% volumetric exchange.  Acceptable methods for ballast water exchange are the Sequential Method, the 
Flow-through Method and the Dilution Method. Noting that ballast water exchange presents significant 
operational concerns and challenges, and that it may not provide a totally effective solution to reduce the 
spread of unwanted aquatic organisms and pathogens from ships’ ballast water over time, the Convention 
requires an upgrade to the installation of ballast water treatment systems in accordance with a specified schedule. 
 
The treatment technologies currently available or being developed can generally be grouped under three broad 
categories based on their primary mechanism for rendering the organism inactive:  
• Mechanical systems (filtration, cyclonic separation, electro-mechanical separation),  
• Physical disinfection (ultraviolet light/ultrasounds, cavitation, de-oxygenation), and  
• Chemical treatment (disinfecting biocides, electrolytic chlorination).  
 
The D-2 standard is the metric used to measure the efficacy of the treatment system and it applies to the system 
as installed on board and used in actual operations. The criteria are in the form of specific limits on aquatic life 
in the ballast discharge. 
 
Ships conducting ballast water management in accordance with this regulation shall discharge: 
• Less than 10 viable organism per m
3
 > 50μ in minimum dimension, and 
• Less than 10 viable organisms per ml < 50μ and > 10μ in minimum dimension, and 
• Less than the following concentrations of indicator microbes: 
– Toxicognic Vibrio cholerae less than 1 colony forming unit (cfu) per 100 ml, or less than 1 cfu per  
1 gram zooplankton samples, 
Prevention and Mitigation Measures  Section 5 
48  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
– Escherichia coli less than 250 cfu per 100 ml, 
– Intestinal Enterococci less than 100 cfu per 100 ml. 
 
All treatment systems must be type approved by an Administration under a robust protocol which requires that 
they satisfy this standard in full scale operations. In any port or offshore terminal, an officer authorized by a 
Party to the Convention may board a vessel to which the Convention applies and test the ballast water 
discharge for compliance by taking samples. 
 
As the Convention is not yet binding globally, actions to address the issue of invasive species are increasingly 
occurring at national, regional and local levels. More than a dozen individual nations and regions have 
introduced specific regulations addressing the discharge of ballast in their waters. Some of these nations and 
regions have introduced local ballast water management requirements.  A small number of these jurisdictions 
may prohibit the discharge of ballast water entirely, require chlorination, or restrict in-port discharge to an 
approved onshore reception facility.  As of March 2014, three PICES member countries had ratified the 
Convention:
3
  Canada, Korea, and Russia.   
5.2.4 Additional information 
For a summary of national regulations targeting ballast water, see Lloyd’s Register: National ballast water 
management requirements.
4
  Currently (as of March 2014), regulations targeting ballast water are mandatory 
only in Canada and the U.S.  They are the only PICES member countries with ballast water sampling 
programs. While Canada and the U.S. have developed guidelines for ballast water sampling, IMO has 
developed guidelines for ballast water sampling, ballast water management plans, ballast water management 
systems and other processes.

PICES Scientific Report No. 48  49 
5.3 IMO Guidelines for the Control and Management of Ships’ Biofouling 
to Minimize the Transfer of Invasive Aquatic Species 
IMO has developed the 2011 Guidelines for the Control and Management of Ships’ Biofouling to Minimize the 
Transfer of Invasive Aquatic Species (Resolution MEPC.207(62)) which aim to reduce the risk of transferring 
biofouling NIS attached to the underwater hull and in niche areas of ships.  The Guidelines have been 
approved and were adopted as an IMO Resolution at the Marine Environmental Protection Committee.  Being 
a Resolution, the Guidelines are not mandatory and do not require signing by member states. Instead, they are 
voluntary guidelines.  The Guidelines are intended to provide useful recommendations on general measures to 
minimize the risks associated with biofouling for all types of ships and are directed to States, shipmasters, 
operators and owners, shipbuilders, ship cleaning and maintenance operators, port authorities, ship repair, dry-
docking and recycling facilities, ship designers, classification societies, anti-fouling paint manufacturers and 
suppliers, and any other interested parties.  A State should determine the extent that the Guidelines are applied 
within that particular State.  However, the Guidelines do not include information about what is considered an 
acceptable level of biofouling and how to measure it. 
 
The IMO Guidelines are available at www.imo.org/blast/blastDataHelper.asp?data_id=30766. 
 
The U.S. has developed national regulations addressing hull fouling. The U.S. regulations follow the IMO 
recommendations and are described in this document in Section 5.4 National Policy and Legislation Targeting 
Non-native Aquatic Species in PICES Member Countries. 
  
Prevention and Mitigation Measures  Section 5 
50  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
5.4 National Policy and Legislation Targeting Non-native Aquatic Species 
in PICES Member Countries 
5.4.1 Canada 
The Canadian federal, provincial and territorial governments introduced An Invasive Alien Species Strategy for 
Canada
6
 in 2004, with the objective to prevent new invasions, detect and respond rapidly to new invasive alien 
species, and manage established invasive alien species through eradication, containment, and control. The 
strategy includes measures to help prevent introductions of invasive alien species from other countries, or of 
species which have moved from one ecosystem to another within Canada. 
 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) is the federal department providing national leadership on aquatic 
invasive species. DFO introduced the Canadian Action Plan to Address the Threat of Aquatic Invasive 
Species.
7
 The Action Plan addresses unintentional/unauthorized introductions that are a result of activities that 
involve handling of e.g., aquarium fish, live baitfish, live fish for the food trade, transgenic aquatic organisms, 
or plants in the horticultural trade that are accidentally introduced to and establish in the wild. 
 
There are procedures in place for authorized introductions under the National Code on Introductions and 
Transfers of Aquatic Organisms
8
 that apply to all aquatic organisms in fresh water and marine habitats 
introduced or transferred into fish rearing waters or fish rearing facilities for the purpose of aquaculture, 
stocking for commercial and recreational fishing, and biocontrol. Applications for introductions and transfers 
are reviewed by a Federal-Provincial Introductions and Transfers Committee in each province. In the review 
process, a risk assessment which is an adaptation of internationally acknowledged models and processes 
(including the ICES Code of Practice) is used to evaluate the potential risk of (a) harmful alterations of natural 
ecosystems, (b) negative effects on native stocks, and (c) introducing and spreading pathogens and parasites 
and other “fellow travellers”. 
 
In Canada, regulations targeting aquatic invasive species (AIS) are embedded in the existing federal and 
provincial regulatory framework. Two federal Acts are particularly relevant to prevent the introduction and 
spread of AIS to the Canadian Pacific coast: The federal Fisheries Act was amended in 2012
9
 to better respond 
to the invasive species challenge, and now provides authorities for managing aquatic invasive species. Aquatic 
Invasive Species Regulations
10
 under the Fisheries Act are under development, and are expected to include 
(a) a list of species affected by the regulations, (b) prohibition protocols to avoid the introduction and spread of 
AIS by restricting activities such as importation, transport and possession of live AIS in various locations, 
(c) permissions to authorize specific low risk activities related to AIS in Canada, and (d) authorities for control 
and eradication activities. 
 
Canada ratified the IMO Ballast Water Management Convention in 2010, and has developed federal 
regulations that address ballast water. Ballast water is regulated in the Ballast Water Control and Management 
Regulations
11
 under the Canada Shipping Act, 2001. These regulations are harmonized to the maximum extent 
possible with current U.S. and international provisions, including the IMO Ballast Water Management 
Convention. Transport Canada is the federal department with regulatory responsibility for the shipping

pathway. Ballast water exchange has been mandatory nationally since 2006 for ships arriving from outside the 
Canadian exclusive economic zone. Canada has an ongoing sampling program of residual water and sediment 
from the ballast tanks of ships, led by Transport Canada. In addition, the Port of Vancouver has additional 
regulations which prohibit ballast water discharge until samples have been taken and analyzed (see Lloyd’s 
Register, Section 5.2.4) 
5.4.2 Japan 
The Japanese government introduced the Basic Policy for Preventing Adverse Effects on Ecosystems Caused 
by Invasive Alien Species
12
 in 2004. 
 
The Invasive Alien Species Act (IAS Act) was adopted in June 2004 and put into force in June 2005. The 
purpose of the IAS Act and the Basic Policy is to prevent adverse effects to Japanese ecosystems, human 
safety, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries caused by alien species. While the IAS Act regulates only intentional 
introductions of species, the Basic Policy addresses both intentional and unintentional introductions. 
 
The Basic Policy outlines the principles concerning the selection of IAS, the handling of IAS, and the 
mitigation of IAS by the national government and other entities. The Basic Policy also points out the 
importance of monitoring, early detection, and rapid response to eradicate or manage established invaders to 
reduce spread, and addresses the importance of increasing scientific knowledge about the impacts of IAS and 
of informing and educating the public. 
 
The IAS Act prohibits the import, raising, planting, storing or carrying without permission of species that are 
designated as IAS. Restrictions apply also to species closely related to IAS that are likely to cause adverse 
effects. Such species are designated Uncategorized Alien Species (UAS) until investigated, after which 
ministers categorize those species into IAS or other alien species, which require no restriction. Species that 
require no restriction but cannot be clearly distinguished from (i.e., look similar to) IAS or UAS must be 
accompanied by a certificate bearing the type name (so-called Living Organisms Required to have a Certificate 
Attached (LORCA) during their importation in order to verify their types). The list of designated IAS, UAS, 
and LORCA was proposed by academic experts based on properties of living organisms and the draft list was 
circulated to the domestic public for comments while World Trade Organization sanitary and phytosanitary 
measures notification was being made.  
 
The Act applies only to species introduced to Japan in 1868 or later. Only taxonomic groups that can be 
identified without the use of special equipment are covered by the IAS Act. Fungi, bacteria, viruses and other 
microscopic organisms are not covered by the Act. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs), plant pests, and 
diseases infectious to humans and livestock should not be designated IAS as they are covered by other Acts. 
The movement of living organisms that are included in ballast water is not covered by the IAS Act. 
 
The Basic Policy also states that “If the person who instigated the act that led to the necessity of emergency 
mitigation is known, said person shall, in principle, receive a claim for repayment of the necessary costs”. 
 
Japan has not ratified the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water 
and Sediments, and has not developed a national strategy or a regulatory framework that addresses ballast 
water issues.  
5.4.3 People’s Republic of China 
In China, there are several Laws and Regulations that address AIS. The Marine Environment Protection Law 
(2000) Article 25 regulates intentional introductions (stocking, aquaculture). It requires introductions of marine 
species to be subject to scientific assessment to avoid damages to marine ecosystems.

 http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/as.html 
Prevention and Mitigation Measures  Section 5 
52  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
The Fisheries Law of the People’s Republic of China (2004), Article 17, addresses disease prevention. It 
requires quarantine to be executed for the import and export of aquatic fingerlings to prevent the transfer of 
disease. 
 
The Regulation on the Prevention and Control of Vessel-induced Pollution to the Marine Environment (2009), 
Article 15, states that ships that contain ballast “shall comply with laws, regulations and relevant standards and 
the relevant international conventions ratified or acceded by China”. However, China has not ratified the IMO 
Ballast Water Management Convention, and China has not developed a national policy or regulations that 
address ballast water. 
 
In addition, a Regional Strategic Action Plan on marine invasive species is envisaged for South East Asia 
through member states of the Coordinating Body for the Seas of East Asia (COBSEA) United Nations 
Environment Programme. China and Korea are members of COBSEA. 
5.4.4 Republic of Korea 
In Korea, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries has the regulatory responsibility for marine invasive species. 
The purpose of the Conservation and Management of Marine Ecosystem Act is to protect marine ecosystems 
from artificial damage and conserve or manage marine ecosystems.
13
 Article 23 (Management of Organisms 
Disturbing Marine Ecosystems) and Article 24 (Management of Harmful Marine Organisms) prohibits 
unauthorized introductions of AIS and provides authorities for managing AIS.  The purpose of the Marine 
Environment Management Act
14
 is to prevent any danger and injury due to either damage of the marine 
environment or marine pollution and create a clean and safe marine environment.  The Ministry carries out 
baseline monitoring of marine ecosystems and coastal wetlands. The Ministry also develops risk assessment 
tools and carries out research on the management of marine invasive species, including rapid response and 
long-term response. 
 
Korea ratified the IMO Ballast Water Management Convention in 2009. In 2007, the Korean government 
enacted and proclaimed the Ballast Water Management Act which reflects the Convention.
15
 The Act and the 
implementing regulation of the Act will take effect on the day that the IMO Ballast Water Management 
Convention comes into force. As of November 2013, ships that have loaded ballast water within 80 km of the 
Fukushima nuclear power plant and within six ports along the northeast coast of the island of Honshu are 
recommended to exchange their ballast water in the open sea prior to entering a Korean port.  
5.4.5 Russia 
Russia has not developed a national strategy targeting AIS specifically. However, The National Strategy of 
Biodiversity Conservation in Russia, The Environmental Doctrine of the Russian Federation, and The Strategy 
for Conservation of Rare and Endangered Species of Animals, Plants, and Fungi provide a policy framework 
for biodiversity conservation that also considers the control of the use, distribution, and management of alien 
species and genetically modified organisms. The framework points out the need to identify pathways, draw up 
an inventory and monitoring strategy, forecast invasions, and prevent hybridization between native species and 
closely related invasive species. 
 
Russia has no specific laws that target only AIS, but several Federal Laws are applicable to the prevention of 
the introduction and management of AIS. The Federal Law on the Conservation of the Environment prohibits 
the unauthorized production, raising and use of non-native organisms. This Law also requires “development of

effective measures for preventing their uncontrolled reproduction”. The Federal Law on the Animal World 
allows for the acclimatization of non-native animals if authorization has been given by the government and the 
requirements for environmental safety has been taken into consideration. The Federal Law on Hunting and 
Conservation of Game Resources and on Amending Specified Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation 
allows the introduction, relocation and hybridization of game species based on scientifically substantiated 
recommendations, if authorization has been given. The Regulations on the Federal Supervisory Natural 
Resources Management Service provides authorities to the Federal Supervisory Natural Management Service 
to issue licences for introducing non-native animals to Russia. The Federal Law on the Specifically Protected 
Natural Territories “prohibits the introduction of living organisms for their acclimatization on the territory of 
the state wildlife reserved areas and national parks”.  
 
The following Laws apply to fishery only:  The Federal Law on Fishery and Conservation of Water Biological 
Resources regulates the introduction or re-introduction of species for the purpose of fishing. The Order of 
Measures for Acclimatization of Water Living Resources defines the order of measures for acclimatization of 
aquatic living resources in water bodies with fishery capabilities. The Federal Laws on the Exclusive Economic 
Zone of the Russian Federation and on the Continental Shelf of the Russian Federation obliges people fishing 
in the Russian exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf not to introduce non-native organisms to 
these waters and to comply with the requirements of the quarantine regime. 
 
Russia ratified the IMO Ballast Water Management Convention in March 2012 and has national regulations in 
place, but they will not come into force until the Convention comes into force. However, two Russian ports in 
the North Pacific are taking measures to prevent ballast water in their harbours: the Prigorodnoye Port which 
requires tankers to exchange ballast water in the open sea, and the Port of Nakhodka which has ballast water 
reception facilities. 
5.4.6 United States of America 
A 1999 Executive Order established the National Invasive Species Council (NISC)
16
 which is comprised of 
representatives from 13 federal departments and agencies of the U.S. government. Coordinated through the 
Council, these agencies are working together to address invasive species issues both domestically and abroad. 
The Council receives advice from the Invasive Species Advisory Committee, which was created through the 
passage of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The NISC adopted a National Management Plan in January 
2001 that was updated in 2008. The 2008–2012 National Invasive Species Management Plan
17 
outlines five 
Strategic Goals for the Federal response (including overall strategy and objectives) to the problem of invasive 
species: prevention; early detection and rapid response; control and management; restoration; organizational 
collaboration. The U.S. legislation explicitly addresses the prevention, mitigation, and eradication of invasive 
species, thereby minimizing their adverse effects on the U.S. and international economies, environment, and 
human, plant, and animal health. The main agencies responsible for managing marine invasive species are: the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). 
 
The National Ocean Policy, established by Presidential Executive Order on July 19, 2010, includes nine 
National Priority Objectives that address pressing issues such as climate change and ocean acidification. A 
strategic action is being developed for each one of these objectives.
18
 Invasive species components are being 
incorporated into strategic action plans to: 
 
• Identify and prevent high-risk introductions of non-native species; 
• Increase research capacity to document economic and ecological impacts; and 
• Establish interagency partnerships to bring together expertise, strengths and resources to control existing 
populations.

Prevention and Mitigation Measures  Section 5 
54  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
Three Federal Acts are relevant to prevent the introduction and spread of AIS to the U.S. Pacific coast: The 
Lacey Act of 1900,
19
 amended in 1998, was originally designed to protect game wildlife. Its role has increased 
to prohibit parties from bringing non-native species that have the potential to become invasive into the United 
States. The Lacey Act gives the USFWS the power to list a species as “injurious” and regulate or prohibit its 
entry into the U.S. 
 
Imports and transfers of aquatic organisms into the U.S. are regulated under the USFWS Title 50 authority. 
Movements within the U.S. are controlled by permits issued at the State level. In 2013, the Invasive Fish and 
Wildlife Prevention Act, addressing imports and transfers was proposed to Congress (i.e., as a bill). The 
purpose of this Act is to establish an improved regulatory process for injurious wildlife to prevent the 
introduction and establishment in the United States of nonnative wildlife and wild animal pathogens and 
parasites that are likely to cause harm. The bill has not yet been enacted into a law.
20
 
 
The U.S. has not ratified the IMO Ballast Water Convention. However, the U.S. (including Hawaii) has ballast 
regulations in place that apply to all ships arriving from outside the U.S. exclusive economic zone. The 
National Invasive Species Act (NISA) was enacted in 1996 with the purpose to prevent the introduction of non-
indigenous species to the United States via ballast water. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has established both 
regulations and guidelines
21
 that address ballast water, and new ballast water management requirements 
entered into force in June 2012. Following these new requirements, ships will be required to have onboard 
ballast water management treatment systems that prevent invasive species from being shipped into U.S. waters 
that will probably make mid-ocean ballast water exchange insufficient.
22
 The USCG has an ongoing sampling 
program of residual water and sediment from the ballast tanks of ships. In addition, regulations in the State of 
California require ships arriving to California waters and carrying ballast water taken on at a location >1 
nautical mile away from the port of arrival, to either exchange their ballast water in mid-ocean waters or the 
ballast water must undergo treatment.
23
 
 
The U.S. has developed national regulations addressing hull fouling (USCG Regulation 33 CFR §151.2050
24
) 
that entered into force June 21, 2012.  Following these regulations, U.S. ships are required carry a Biofouling 
Management Plan in accordance with the IMO guidelines and to remove fouling organisms from the vessel’s 
hull, piping and tanks on a regular basis. In addition, the State of California has proposed changes to Article 
4.8 Biofouling Management Regulations for Vessels Operating in California Waters
25
, but these changes have 
not yet been adopted. 
 
The Clean Boating Act
26
 (CBA) of 2008 has the objective to reduce water pollution and the spread of invasive 
species by recreational boating in U.S. rivers, lakes, coastal waters, and waters out to 12 nautical miles from 
shore. The USCG has enforcement authority under the CBA.

The Program was initiated in 2005 by Fisheries and Oceans Canada 
(DFO) to respond to the invasive species challenge. From 2005–2010  
$3 million was spent on research, covering a wide range of issues, 
including research linked to the prevention of new invasions and the 
management of established and spreading invaders (containment, 
eradication, and control). Much of the funded research targeted the 
shipping pathway and invasive tunicates in the aquaculture industry. The 
Program supplemented other AIS activities in Canada such as the 
Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network research and DFO’s risk 
assessments carried out by the Centre of Expertise for Aquatic Risk 
Assessment (CEARA). Together, these activities targeted most of the 
species listed by the provinces and regions as being of elevated concern. 
The results from the projects have been used to provide scientific advice 
in support of regulations, policy and management strategies, and have 
been communicated to a wide range of stakeholders. 
Genomics Research and Development 
Initiative (GRDI), 
http://grdi-irdg.collaboration.gc.ca/eng/about/ 
GRDI is developing molecular tools that can be applied for the early 
detection of AIS.  The current focus is on developing the molecular 
methods, selecting the appropriate gene regions (multiple) for each taxa 
and populating a baseline library of native and non-indigenous species 
to be able to compare field data to.

Korea Institute of Ocean Science and 
Technology (KIOST), 
http://www.kiost.ac  
KIOST is a government-supported research institute in the field of ocean 
research and development.  It is in charge of the “National Survey of 
Marine Ecosystem”, which is an obligatory national survey of the 
coastal marine ecosystem in Korea by the Conservation and 
Management of Marine Ecosystem Act. The nationwide survey is carried 
out along the entire coastal area in Korea at a 10-year interval (2006–
2015). The survey covers all major ports and is part of a port-based early 
detection system.  
 
KIOST carried out a project named Development of Port Environmental 
Risk Assessment Technology (PERAT) from 2007–2010. The objective 
was to provide scientific support for ballast water treatment systems 
(BWTs) and develop a port management program that would assist the 
implementation of a Ballast Water Management plan. The project 
entailed visiting as many ships and ports as possible. Biological and 
environmental information was collected from ballast tanks and 
analyzed with vector analysis. Port baseline surveys were carried out 
within harbor limits. By investigating risky characters, viability, and 
source of NIS inside the ballast tanks, port-specific management 
programs have been developed and updated and accompanied by port 
baseline surveys. Results from the project have been used to provide 
scientific advice to concerned parties in charge of ballast water, 
including government, shipping companies and other national institutes. 
 
KIOST is developing ballast water treatment systems and land-based 
and shipboard testing for the type approval of ballast water management 
systems in Korea according to the Provisional Regulation of Type 
Approval of Ballast Water Management System.

Section 7  Collaboration 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  61 
7 Collaboration between ICES Expert Groups and PICES WG 21  
 
 
There are two ICES expert groups that address aquatic NIS. The Working Group on Ballast and Other Ship 
Vectors (WGBOSV) which provides scientific support to the development of international measures aimed at 
reducing the risk of transporting non-native species via shipping activities and the Working Group on 
Introduction and Transfers of Marine Organisms (WGITMO), which deals with aquatic alien species that have 
an influence on and/or occur in the marine environment. 
 
7.1 Joint Meetings of the Related ICES Working Groups and PICES WG 21 
In 2007 and 2009, joint back-to-back meetings of the PICES and ICES working groups on NIS were held. The 
first joint meeting, attended by PICES WG 21, ICES WGITMO, and the ICES/IOC/IMO WGBOSBV, was 
held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, concurrent with the 5
th
 Marine Bioinvasions Conference, May 25–26, 
2007. The following points were emphasized: 
• Potential projects for “Development of the prevention systems for harmful organism’s expansion in the 
Pacific Rim”; 
• Lack of taxonomic expertise limiting ICES-PICES exchange; 
• Need for the registry of taxonomic experts; 
• Addition of AIS (Aquatic Invasive Species) data based on NISBase; 
• Use of bivalve molluscs for database testing; 
• Ballast water and biofouling as potential vectors; 
• ICES Ballast Water Sampling Guidelines – review of ballast water issues, including early detection, rapid 
response, impacts, costs, successes, and failures from world-wide examples; role of government and 
citizens in an EDRR (Early Detection and Rapid Response) system. 
 
Suggestions for future co-operation included: 
• ICES Code of Practice for the Introduction and Transfer of Marine Organisms; 
• Risk assessments or analysis; 
• Guidelines for sampling ballast water; 
• Other areas for joint projects, including hull fouling. 
 
The second joint meeting was held in 2009, when guests from ICES WGITMO attended the fourth Annual 
Meeting of WG 21 (PICES-2009, Jeju, Korea). The Chairs and Co-Chairs of the Working Groups also met 
during the 6
th
 Marine Bioinvasions Conference, held August 24–27 2009, in Portland, USA. 
 
In addition, there is an ongoing liaison between the ICES and PICES Working Group Chairs, including a 
sharing of meeting reports and project status.

62  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
7.2 Recommendations for Enhanced Linkages between ICES and PICES 
As the introduction and spread of NIS will continue, establishing global linkages between international 
organizations working with different ocean basins should be a priority. Collaborations between PICES and 
ICES, such as a joint working group, could be a portal for sharing information and directed collaboration. This 
would facilitate the exchange of knowledge across ocean basins, and provide an opportunity to collaborate on 
marine and brackish water NIS on a larger scale. These collaborations would benefit understanding of the 
invasion process, including the different pathways and vectors and individual species, as it would enhance 
access to expertise when working on specific species. Collaboration could be initiated as joint research 
projects, large-scale risk assessments or international RAS. 
 
Given shared interests in marine science issues, PICES and ICES have revised a framework for strategic 
collaboration
27
 that should include NIS.  For example, ICES has three strategic initiatives,
28
 one of them being 
the Strategic Initiative on Biodiversity Science and Advice (SIBAS)
29
 where NIS constitute a key piece of 
SIBAS’ mandate, and WG 21 has fed into SIBAS.  Any new PICES expert group dealing with NIS should be 
aware of SIBAS and make linkages to it.   
 
At the working level, there could be enhanced linkages through workshops and special sessions at international 
conferences and meetings. For example, there will be a joint ICES/PICES Theme Session at the 2014 ICES 
Annual Science Conference, in A Coruña, Spain,
30
 entitled “The increasing importance of biofouling for 
marine invasions: an ecosystem altering mechanism”. There could be enhanced linkages between PICES and 
ICES through a joint meeting/special session at the next Marine Bioinvasions Conference scheduled for 
January 2016 in Sidney, Australia, and the 10
th
 International Marine Bioinvasions Conference tentatively 
scheduled for 2018 in Argentina.  There is opportunity for ICES to become more involved in the Scientific 
Steering Committee of the International Conference on Marine Bioinvasions. 
 
While the PICES NIS database/Atlas was presented to ICES, the database is now closed and there is currently 
no mechanism to get additional data from ICES.  However, if a common portal to add information, update the 
database and share information is developed, ICES should be invited to contribute to the future development of 
the database. 
 
Linkages could also be made between ICES and PICES, as ICES develops advice to implement the European 
Union’s Marine Strategy Framework Directive
31
 (adopted in June 2008), and NIS are considered during the 
development of monitoring programs.

Section 8  Summary and Recommendations 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  63 
8 Summary and Recommendations 
 
 
During its term (2005–2013) WG 21:  
• Reviewed and recommended terminology that will clarify future communication among PICES member 
countries on marine NIS, 
• Completed an inventory of NIS around the North Pacific (as of 2012),  
• Reviewed international and national policies in place (as of 2012) to reduce the risk of marine NIS,  
• Identified potential mechanisms to engage on marine NIS issues with the broader scientific and regulatory 
community, and  
• Conducted training and capacity building activities.   
 
Thus, WG 21 has successfully completed its terms of reference.  However, this does not mean that the problem 
of marine NIS has been solved in the North Pacific as marine NIS represent a current and persistent risk to 
PICES member countries. Although there is considerable work still ahead, the NIS database, Atlas of Non-
indigenous Marine and Estuarine Species in the North Pacific and other accomplishments of WG 21 have 
positioned PICES well to better understand and advance marine NIS topics, including emerging vectors (e.g., 
vessel biofouling, tsunami/marine debris), altered species distributions, risk assessment, and interactions/ 
impacts on marine ecosystems (including structure, function, productivity, and resilience). As the next logical 
step, the completed comprehensive database on marine NIS distributions can now be utilized to gain insight to 
the changes and impacts of NIS around the North Pacific. Recently, the information on NIS distributions/ 
tolerances in the database was used by Canada to identify potential high risk species associated with tsunami 
debris as a result of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake of magnitude 9.0.  Also, there is considerable 
interest about how projected global climate change will affect the introduction, spread and impacts of NIS in 
the North Pacific and to undertake risk identification to inform potential mitigation measures by PICES 
member countries. Global climate change and the associated decrease in Arctic ice cover, combined with the 
opening of new shipping routes, pose questions related to the introduction and spread of NIS. Interest has been 
expressed in addressing specific NIS vectors or taxa (e.g., tunicates, bivalves, European green crab) of 
common interest to many PICES member countries. Collaboration with other international organizations on 
NIS will be a benefit to PICES, and organizations such as ICES, NOWPAP and WESTPAC have expressed 
interest in continuing to work with PICES on marine NIS issues. Information in this report can be used to 
identify priority topics for potential future activities on marine NIS within PICES.  Since marine NIS are a 
priority for many PICES member countries and currently only ballast water will be regulated under the IMO 
(via the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments), 
PICES would be the appropriate intergovernmental organization to exchange information on marine NIS in the 
North Pacific including, but not limited to, changing NIS distributions, emerging vectors, risk assessment, 
impact characterization, and policy/management development.  This will allow continued exchange of 
knowledge across the North Pacific where many previous incursions have occurred and is an appropriate 
interface with the international community (e.g., ICES, NOWPAP, IMO).  Thus, at a minimum PICES should 
establish an expert group that can continue to exchange information on changing marine NIS dynamics via the 
WG 21 NIS database.  
 
There are many examples demonstrating that marine NIS are a significant stressor that can alter ecosystem 
structure and function.  Thus, given the NIS database and Atlas, there is a strong linkage to the PICES 
FUTURE program and the North Pacific Ecosystem Status Report.  The information in the database could be 
used to develop a NIS indicator related to anthropogenic stress and/or ecosystem health.  However, to 
Summary and Recommendations  Section 8 
64  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
implement this in the context of FUTURE and/or the North Pacific Ecosystem Status Report, it would be 
necessary to update this index as a time series for each ecoregion: a task that could easily be accomplished by a 
PICES expert group such as an advisory panel. A continued NIS expert group would allow the exploration of 
climate change models on the most probable changes in NIS distributions around the North Pacific and the 
identification of likely changes in NIS vectors (e.g., new shipping routes, expanding trade). Further, this new 
expert group could address how PICES member countries have been affected by NIS and what community 
responses have occurred due to NIS incursions in the North Pacific.  This information could help inform policy 
and management options within each PICES member country and is aligned with recent PICES efforts to 
include more socio-economic elements. 
 
WG 21 considered several potential options for PICES’ continued involvement in marine NIS issues but the 
option of simply moving forward with annual or biennial topic sessions associated with PICES Annual 
Meetings was determined to be unsustainable without a formal group structure to organize and oversee 
activities.  Thus, WG 21 recommends the establishment of an Advisory Panel on Aquatic Non-indigenous 
Species (AP-NIS) for continuing aquatic NIS activities in the North Pacific.  This preferred option would allow 
continued progress on marine NIS issues, with the lowest resource commitment. 
 
Advisory Panel on Aquatic Non-indigenous Species (AP-NIS) 
 
Suggested parents: MONITOR and/or BIO 
 
Proposed terms of reference: 
1. Continue to share information on aquatic non-indigenous species (NIS) in the North Pacific via an updated 
NIS database; 
2. Exchange information on updated regulations/policy, best practices for monitoring, early detection, rapid 
response, and control/containment options; 
3. Develop a better understanding of changing distributions of NIS and invasion pathways and vectors in the 
context of global climate change including expected changes in water temperature, salinity, oxygen, and 
pCO
2
;  
4. Plan workshops/sessions/symposia related to NIS topics. (For example a joint PICES/ICES Theme 
Session on “The increasing importance of biofouling for marine invasions: an ecosystem altering 
mechanism” was held at the 2014 ICES Annual Science Conference.); 
5. Work with other international, intergovernmental organizations (e.g., ICES, NOWPAP and WESTPAC) 
and/or countries to accomplish these terms of reference, especially those related to data/information 
exchange; 
6. Prepare regular reports on accomplishments.

Appendix 4 
WG 21 Rapid Assessment Survey Framework 
RAS standardized data collection protocol 
Purpose 
This rapid assessment survey (RAS) will identify native, non-native and cryptogenic species present at ports in 
PICES member countries.  Although it may not be possible to characterize all habitat types within a port, this 
survey focuses on major ecosystem components, namely intertidal and subtidal habitats.  Intertidal habitats 
will be sampled using both a timed walk and quadrat/grab sampling methods.  Subtidal habitats will be 
sampled using (tunicate) collectors, trapping for macrofauna (primarily crabs) and a survey of the fouling 
communities on floating docks and their associated structure.  The RAS is a qualitative survey (not a 
quantitative one) meant to capture the species composition within each port surveyed.  The assignment of 
native, non-native or cryptogenic status will occur following species identification based on literature accounts, 
general rules for classification of status (e.g., Chapman and Carlton, 1991), and discussion by the sampling 
team consisting of members of WG 21.  It is essential that the taxonomy is resolved to the greatest extent 
possible. However, where there is uncertainty in species identification a species name should not be “forced”, 
as this might increase the risk of misidentification. 
Access 
Based on our first RAS survey in China it is now clear that port security is an issue and that an international 
sampling team might not be allowed access to a given port.  Thus, it is imperative that the host country identify 
the specific requirements (port authority or country) and determine the feasibility of gaining access to 
potentially secure locations for sampling.  As soon as possible, each country needs to appoint a contact person 
for the survey.  This contact person will work with the lead Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Therriault in 
planning and execution of the RAS. Dr. Therriault should be notified as soon as possible as to whether 
sampling will be done by the international sampling team or in advance by the host country. 
Timing 
Although many invertebrate species (not all) would appear in greater abundances during the warmer, summer 
months, sampling will coincide with the annual PICES meeting.  As agreed, the RAS will be conducted in the 
host PICES member country the week prior to the annual meeting (generally mid-October).  Thus, some 
taxonomic groups might not be encountered during the RAS, resulting in incorrect classification as ‘not 
present’ at the sampled locations.  This is expected and is one limitation of this type of RAS.  To fully 
characterize a site, sampling should be repeated during other seasons.  If possible, some sampling should be 
conducted during the summer months when daylight tides are lower.  Samples can be preserved for 
identification later and can be used to supplement any collections made by the international sampling team.

PICES Scientific Report No. 48  79 
Taxonomy 
The goal and success of this type of survey requires the participation of taxonomic experts with broad 
knowledge of their taxonomic group, in addition to the participation of taxonomic generalists that are able to 
help with sampling and species identification (primarily via the use of identification keys).  This type of survey 
also provides training to the generalists.  Given the limited budget, the RAS will be conducted using as many 
taxonomic experts from the host country as possible with participation from members of WG 21.  Participation 
of students is encouraged for logistical support and training.  Due to the contribution by the Japanese 
government, we have some funds available to cover travel/accommodation costs associated with host country 
taxonomists as well as some funds to cover the costs of “key” taxonomic experts not readily available in the 
host country.  Given one goal of the project is to resolve and/or identify potential non-indigenous species 
transported across the North Pacific, it is highly desirable to have taxonomic experts from both the eastern and 
western Pacific for each taxonomic group targeted (or potentially expected) during the survey. 
 
Given that the taxonomy for some species will be controversial, it is imperative that voucher specimens are 
maintained for future reference.  It is expected that the host PICES member country would maintain their 
respective RAS collections in suitable archives.  Further, all species records will be entered into the PICES 
WG 21 Nonindigenous Species Database (many at the time of the survey but others following species 
verification where necessary).  The major taxonomic groups likely to be encountered are provided in Appendix 
A and the host PICES member country should identify local experts for these groups who can participate in the 
RAS.  If local experts are not available, other experts may be identified from other countries as needed. 
Sampling sites 
Given that not all species will be found in all habitat types, sampling needs to encompass as many habitat types 
as possible.  Thus, where possible, sampling teams should strive to sample two separate intertidal and two 
separate subtidal locations within each port.  It is recommended that one intertidal and one subtidal location be 
sampled each day for each port.  Thus, this RAS will capture at least four different locations within a port over 
a two day period.  Also, where necessary, permission and permits may be required and should be obtained in 
advance if possible. 
Sampling methods 
Site description  
At each sampling site it is important that a general physical site description be made, including an 
accompanying diagram of the site.  General information that should be collected include the number and types 
of habitats encountered (e.g., mudflat, oyster reef, etc.), relative size of these habitats, notable site attributes 
(e.g., marina present, shellfish aquaculture present, river/creek draining across the beach, etc.), and general 
biological communities observed (e.g., barnacles present on floats above the water and mussels present below, 
boulder community dominated by mixed algae, etc.).  In addition, specific site data needs to be recorded 
including latitude, longitude, sampling day, sampling time, sampling team members, temperature, salinity, etc.  
Also, a number of photographs documenting the site characteristics should be taken for future reference and 
report writing. 
Environmental variables 
At each site environmental variables should be measured including temperature, salinity, and dissolved 
oxygen.  If possible, other variables that could be measured include total dissolved solids (TDS), chlorophyll a, 
and Secchi disc depth.  For intertidal zones it is important to measure beach slope and intertidal zone length.  
For subtidal zones it is important to note the tidal amplitude and maximum water depth. 
WG 21 Rapid Assessment Survey Framework Appendix 4      
80  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
Subtidal survey (collector sampling) 
These passive collectors are deployed 4–6 months in advance of collection.  When retrieved, the Petri dishes 
attached to the collector lids are individually stored in Zip-lock (or other self-sealing plastic) bags and labelled 
(collection date, collector number, sampling depth, Petri dish number).  If processing is not immediate then 
dishes need to be preserved in either 3.7% formalin or 95% ethanol (NOTE: ethanol preservation is required 
for genetic analyses).  Any large macrofauna should be recorded as should any species that is present on the 
collector lids but not readily observed on the individual Petri dishes. 
Subtidal survey (floating docks and associated structures) 
Due to the floating nature of these structures the sampling is NOT tide dependent and should be conducted 
before or after the intertidal sampling, depending on the time of the daylight low tide.  Time spent surveying 
the floating structure should be restricted to 1 hour for the sampling team which will allow standardization 
among sampling sites.  Additional time will be required for measurement of environmental variables and site 
characterization, so sampling teams should allow about 2 hours to complete this part of the survey.  At each 
site larger organisms can be identified in situ if possible and voucher photographs taken.  All medium to small 
organisms should be collected.  Any organism that cannot be positively identified or look different need to be 
collected for taxonomic identification at the laboratory.  Samples should be collected by taking scrapings of the 
fouling community at different locations along the floating structure.  If possible, divers or snorkelers can be 
deployed to make collections on the underside of the floating structure or along the support pilings.  Scrapings 
should be collected using aquarium nets to prevent organisms from falling off and escaping. 
Subtidal survey (trapping) 
In order to characterize the mobile macrofauna such as crabs, baited crab traps should be deployed for 24 hours 
and retrieved.  Generally, traps would be deployed the day before the subtidal/intertidal surveys and retrieved 
when the sampling team returns to conduct the survey the following day.  The traps would be re-set the day of 
the survey and collected the following day following the survey.  All organisms should be retained for 
identification/measurement prior to release or destruction.  In our surveys we have used the Fukui square 
multispecies marine trap (FT-100) and found they work well.  Also, bait may change depending on country of 
sampling but we found that herring works well.  Simply ensure the bait is in a bait jar that is suspended inside 
the trap. 
Intertidal survey (timed walk) 
If possible, sampling should be conducted when low tides are maximal thereby exposing significant portions of 
the intertidal zone for sample collection.  Following site characterization (and environmental measures) the 
sampling team should proceed to randomly walk the intertidal zone (beach) to maximize the number of 
microhabitats visited.  The time of the timed walk should be consistent among sampling sites and should be  
1 hour in total with 20 minutes spent in each of the low, mid and high intertidal zones.  Additional time will be 
required for environmental sampling and site characterization so sampling teams should arrive at the beach 
about 2 hours before the daylight low tide.  During the timed walk larger organisms should be identified in situ 
if possible and voucher photographs taken.  All medium to small organisms should be collected.  Any 
organism that looks different needs to be collected for later taxonomic identification.  Any species that cannot 
be positively identified in the field needs to be retained for verification at the laboratory. 
Intertidal survey (quadrat sampling/grab sampling) 
There are two methods to characterize the infaunal community, Ekman (or similar) sediment grabs for smaller 
benthic organisms and quadrat sampling (50 cm × 50 cm × 30 cm deep) for larger organisms (e.g., bivalves).  
Replicate Ekman grabs should be made at each of the three intertidal heights (low, mid and high) and sieved 
Appendix 4  WG 21 Rapid Assessment Survey Framework     
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  81 
through 1 mm mesh.  Replicate quadrat samples should be made at each of the three intertidal heights and also 
should be sieved but due to the larger size of the target organisms the sieve size can be 3 mm.  Generally this 
type of digging would occur in areas where clam siphons are noted.  Although our survey is focused on 
macroorganisms, unsieved samples could be archived for microorganisms such as dinoflagellates, 
foraminifera, diatoms, etc.

2004 Summary of Scientific Sessions and Workshops at PICES XIII 
 
MEQ Topic Session (S5)  
Natural and anthropogenic introductions of marine species 
 
Co-sponsored by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) 
 
Co-Convenors:  William P. Cochlan (U.S.A./PICES), Yasuwo Fukuyo (Japan/PICES) and Stephan Gollasch 
(Germany/ICES) 
 
Background 
 
Species introductions are among the most 
prevalent of human activities affecting natural 
ecosystems.  In the marine environment, 
introductions, including most aquaculture 
initiatives, have resulted in both positive and 
negative effects.  The transport of invasive species, 
such as phytoplankton, is thought to stem from 
range extensions associated with fluctuating 
oceanographic conditions (e.g., El Niño), severe 
storm events (e.g., typhoons), and human activities 
(e.g., ballast water).  The impact of transport 
processes on species distributional changes in 
North Pacific waters is not fully understood.  
Relative to the terrestrial environment, the study of 
introductions, and the potential for new species to 
become invasive, is in its infancy in marine 
systems.  Emerging work includes introduction 
vectors, life history characteristics of invasive 
species, ocean conditions responsible for 
invasions, ecosystem resistance to invasion, and 
potential for eradication or mitigation of 
introductions once established.  This session 
sought to answer three fundamental questions:   
1) What is known about different transport 
mechanisms?  2) What is the magnitude of 
ecological and economic effects arising from the 
transport of species?  and 3) What steps can be 
taken to minimize real or potential effects of 
existent and future invasive species? The current 
session is particularly timely given that the IMO 
Ballast Water Management Convention was signed 
in February 2004, and is now awaiting ratification. 
 
Summary of presentations 
 
The session consisted of 11 oral presentations and 
1 poster, representing authorship from five PICES 
nations:  Canada, Japan, Korea, Russia and the 
United States, and six non-PICES nations: 
Australia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico and 
New Zealand, as well as ICES.  Despite the broad 
range of invasive topics selected for this session, 
the attendance was modest.  The late cancellation 
of one oral presentation permitted careful 
discussion and additional questions for each of the 
talks:  an opportunity well received by those in 
attendance.  The session’s presentations were 
organized around 1) the case histories of invasives, 
including both pelagic and benthic organisms,  
2) descriptive and mathematical analyses of 
invasive vectors and their relative importance in 
various marine systems, and 3) management of 
invasion vectors, followed by discussion of any 
aspect of the session and consideration of future 
workshop ideas. 
 
After brief introductory remarks by one of the co-
convenors (S. Gollasch), the first invited speaker 
(Gustaaf Hallegraeff) discussed the role of ship’s 
ballast water in spreading harmful algal bloom 
(HAB) species in Australian coastal waters, 
including the presence of culturable Pseudo-nitschia 
diatoms and Pfiesteria piscisida dinoflagellates in 
ballast waters.  His presentation also discussed the 
special problem of invasive cysts, methods to 
determine if these invasive cysts have firmly 
established themselves in new environments, and 
 
  
WG 21 Annual Reports Appendix 6 
88  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
 the treatments to remove invasive species in ballast 
waters or destroy their viability.  The next two 
speakers continued with case histories of invasive 
species, including the seaweed Undaria pinnatifida 
and their molecular identification (Shinya Uwai), 
and a Russian study of the invasive success of 
benthic species (polychaetes and phoronids) in the 
more ecologically stressed and contaminated 
regions of the Peter the Great Bay (Tatiana Belan).  
 
Majorie Wonham, our next invited speaker, 
discussed the various hypotheses used to describe 
the apparent increase in marine biological 
invasions.  Using existent data sets (from six 
independent marine systems), she demonstrated 
that often more than one model (linear, exponential 
and exponential) can describe temporal invasion 
trends, and outlined the difficulty of interpreting 
species invasions without consideration of both 
introduction rates and survival probabilities.  
Stephan Gollasch (invited ICES speaker) posed the 
question of whether ballast water was the key 
vectors for aquatic species invasions.  His 
presentation reviewed the relative importance of 
the various vectors for species introductions in 
twelve marine regions around the world, and 
demonstrated that hull fouling, ballast water and 
aquaculture were the most important vectors in all 
regions considered.  However, his analysis also 
showed that the relative importance of these vector 
is regionally specific, and that hull fouling, not 
ballast waters, was the dominant vector in 60% of 
the regions considered;  a conclusion which 
suggests that increased international regulation of 
ballast water introductions will not necessarily 
eliminate or decrease species invasions in all 
regions.  Dan Minchin continued with the theme of 
vectors, and showed the importance of small craft, 
(open boats, yachts and cruisers) in transporting 
invasive species, and how their relative importance 
has appeared to increase with the growing number 
of citizens capable of owning and operating such 
craft.  His analysis also demonstrated the 
importance of marinas as exchange points for 
invasives from the primary vector of shipping to 
the secondary vector of small craft which further 
increase their range extension to areas inaccessible 
by shipping alone. 
 
Yasuwo Fukuyo, in a series of back-to-back 
presentations, outlined the IMO Ballast Water 
Management Convention, its history and articles, 
and most importantly the challenges present in 
obscure wording (e.g., viability) and the availability 
of reliable scientific methods to support the 
performance standards outlined in the Convention.  
A very promising technique (Special Pipe) designed 
in Japan to terminate ballast water organisms using 
shear stress and cavitation was described, and its 
tests of efficacy presented.  Jennifer Boehme 
outlined a verification system to ensure that mid-
ocean ballast water exchange procedures are 
actually conducted based on the optical 
characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic 
matter (CDOM) present in the original ballast water.  
She showed that statistics could be effectively used 
to discriminate the variability of CDOM florescence 
in various oceanic and coastal regions, and that such 
an analysis could offer a verification system 
independent of port salinity.  Scott Godwin 
described recent efforts to identify and control 
species introductions associated with hull-fouling - 
the principal invasive vector in Hawaiian waters, 
using a risk-management approach based on a 
relative fouling risk associated with various vessels 
and the dynamics of their arrival in Hawaiian ports.  
The final oral presentation by Stephan Gollasch was 
an introduction to the history, practices and work 
products resulting from the ICES efforts on the 
introductions of marine organisms.  He concluded 
with a number of suggestions including the 
establishment of a PICES Working Group on 
Species invasions (not limited to HABs), and the 
reciprocal attendance of PICES and ICES members 
at their annual meetings and working sessions.  He 
urged PICES member countries to follow the “ICES 
Code of Practice for the Introduction and Transfer 
of Organisms” when planning species introductions, 
and emphasized the need for both regional and 
global networks to most efficiently deal with 
biological invasions, given that an invasive species 
could originate from a non-PICES nation. 
 
The session was concluded by a lively discussion 
led by Dr. Fukuyo where representatives of all 
PICES member countries in attendance agreed upon 
the establishment of a Working Group on Marine 
invasive species.  Such a working group will serve 
as a means to create awareness of the species 
invasion problem, encourage additional scientific 
research on the issue, and enhance funding 
opportunities dealing with marine invasive 
initiatives in PICES member countries, and 
eventually may support the timely ratification and 
implementation of the IMO Ballast Water 
Management Convention.

MEQ Workshop (W2) 
Introduced species in the North Pacific 
 
Co-sponsored by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) 
 
Co-convenors: Yasuwo Fukuyo (Japan/PICES), Stephan Gollasch (Germany/ICES) and Glen Jamieson 
(Canada/PICES) 
 
 
Background 
 
The workshop concerned the status of introduced 
organisms in member countries and progress in 
developing inventories of introduced species;  
reports of activities related to research on vectors, 
including natural (currents and organisms such as 
turtles and birds), and anthropogenic (ballast 
water, hull fouling, fisheries, etc.) ones;  reports of 
activities related to the Ballast Water Management 
Convention, especially measurement of compliance 
with ballast water exchange protocols, and 
measurement of effectiveness and development of 
systems of ballast water treatment.  The workshop 
aimed to have a discussion on the establishment of 
a Working Group on introduced species under 
MEQ. 
 
Summary of presentations 
 
Fourteen of 15 scheduled speakers presented 
papers, with contributors from both PICES and 
ICES members.  Papers presented ranged from 
descriptions and listings of NIS by geographic 
area, the characteristics of species that increase 
their survival if transported to new areas and 
habitats, the consequences of NIS on ecosystems, 
research requirements to address recently approved 
guidelines in the Ballast Water Management 
Convention that were established at MEPC 53 in 
July 2005, and the implications from using 
approved chemicals or products to treat water 
(possible within the Convention) for control of 
NIS, and finally, the characteristics of bacterial 
communities found in ballast water tanks and their 
reduction as a result of before and after mid-ocean 
exchanges.  
 
Discussion following the presentations included 
the impact of global warming on NIS spread, the 
utility of risk assessment in identifying the most 
important introduction vectors, the challenges in 
developing mitigation measures, and how 
changing water characteristics (quality and heat 
discharge) seem to be favouring survival rates on 
new invaders. 
 
The workshop discussion included a proposal to 
establish a new PICES Working Group on invasive 
species.

REPORT OF WORKING GROUP 21 ON  
NON-INDIGENOUS AQUATIC SPECIES 
            
 
 
The Working Group on Non-indigenous aquatic 
species (WG 21) held its first meeting on October 
13, under the chairmanship of Ms. Darlene Smith.  
A list of participants can be found in WG 21 
Endnote 1.  Dr. Graham Gillespie served as the 
rapporteur.  The draft agenda was reviewed and 
adopted without changes (WG 21 Endnote 2). 
 
Terms of Reference (Agenda Items 4-6) 
 
The participants reviewed WG 21 Terms of 
Reference (TOR) approved at PICES XIV 
(October 2005, Vladivostok, Russia).  Progress 
toward accomplishing these Terms of Reference 
and developing a plan for their completion were 
discussed concurrently as TOR were reviewed:  A 
summary of discussion is reported after each TOR. 
 
TOR#1 Complete an inventory of all aquatic 
non-indigenous species (NIS) in all PICES member 
countries together with compilation and definitions 
of terms and recommendations on use of terms.  
Summarize the situation on bioinvasions in the 
Pacific and compare and contrast to other regions 
(e.g., Atlantic, Australia, etc.): 
 
Should the inventory of NIS include freshwater as 
well as marine species? 
This was discussed at some length with the 
conclusion that the NIS list would include marine 
and estuarine species but would not include 
exclusively freshwater species.  This decision was 
based on PICES’ focus as a marine science 
organization and the large magnitude of species if 
freshwater NIS were included.  It was suggested to 
explicitly indicate that “The organismal domain of 
WG 21 will be non-indigenous aquatic taxa that 
spend any life history stage in marine, estuarine, 
or brackish systems (this includes anadromous and 
catadromous taxa)”. 
 
Should WG 21 create a new on-line database or take 
advantage of existing systems such as NISBASE 
(http://www.NISBASE.org/nisbase/ index.jsp) or 
the Global Invasive Species Information Network 
(http://www.gisnetwork. org/ pubs.html)? 
WG 21 recognizes that the creation of a new 
PICES on-line database would require resources, 
both human and financial.  WG 21 members will 
investigate the existing internet databases and 
provide their preferences on how to proceed with 
this issue.  [Action] 
 
Drs. Henry Lee and Deborah Reusser will make 
contact with both the USGS-Gainesville and the 
Smithsonian about the process of linking into 
NISBASE.  [Action] 
 
Definitions of terms and recommendations on use 
of terms 
A number of countries (China, Russia, Japan) do 
not have definitions described in law or policy, but 
do have terms that are generally used to describe 
non-indigenous species that may or may not be 
harmful.  In Canada and the United States the 
implication of harmful is associated with invasive. 
 
The Chairman will compile definitions from 
Canada, the U.S. and the ICES Working Group on 
Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms 
(WGITMO), and will seek input from China, 
Korea, Japan and Russia.  Following this meeting 
draft PICES definitions will be produced for 
subsequent discussion and agreement. 
 
Summarize the situation on bioinvasions in the 
Pacific and compare and contrast with other 
regions 
This was discussed briefly and requires additional 
thought as it is potentially a large undertaking.  It 
was noted that “situation” is a somewhat vague 
term.  WG 21 seeks advice from MEQ on what is 
meant by “situation”.  It was suggested that 
“situation” could include a summary of national 
legislation/policy, research programs and 
management programs.  It could also include a 
WG 21 Annual Reports Appendix 6 
94  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
description of the major invasive species and the 
impacts they are having.  [Action] 
 
TOR#2 Complete inventory of scientific experts, 
in all PICES member countries, on aquatic non-
indigenous species subject areas and of the 
relevant national research programs/ projects 
underway: 
 
An inventory of scientific experts 
It was concluded that if distribution of an 
inventory of scientific experts was limited to 
PICES members that this should not be an issue.  
Should the inventory receive wide distribution, this 
will need to be re-visited. 
 
The participants discussed the relative scarcity of 
taxonomic expertise in all member countries, with 
the situation perhaps most pressing in Western 
Pacific countries.  The Census of Marine Life 
(CoML) was identified as an example of 
international exchange of taxonomic expertise, but 
it was noted that CoML has a limited lifespan.  A 
joint ICES/PICES workshop was discussed as a 
means to continue centralizing expertise after 
CoML has completed its term. 
 
The need to explore linkages between classical 
taxonomy and molecular techniques was also 
discussed.  It was suggested that this would be an 
ideal theme for a future symposium. 
 
Dr. Adolf Kellermann suggested that the PICES 
and ICES Working Groups may wish to produce a 
compilation of vernacular names, and that ICES 
and PICES could consider joint financial support 
of such an undertaking.  The participants also 
brought up the possibility of PICES translating 
critical taxonomic keys into a common language 
(English).  This is not exactly the same as a 
compilation of vernacular names. 
 
The U.S. has conducted Rapid Assessment 
Surveys which are week-long field surveys 
attended by a broad range of taxonomic experts. 
 
ToR#3 Review and evaluate initiatives on 
mitigation measures (e.g., ICES Code of Practice 
for the Introduction and Transfer of Marine 
Organisms; IMO Ballast Water Management 
Convention and others such as the Canadian 
Introductions and Transfers Code): 
 
Again, this TOR is a significant project.  For now, 
documents will be compiled and made available to 
WG 21 members.  The list of documents was 
expanded beyond the suggested examples to add 
material from Australia and New Zealand, the 
Canadian Shipping Act and U.S. Management 
Plans and included the following documents: 
 Australian guidelines for managing marine 
pest biofouling risks; 
 RAC-SPA Action Plan concerning species 
introductions and invasive species in the 
Mediterranean Sea; 
 Risk assessment of ballast water mediated 
species introduction:  A Baltic Sea approach; 
 Guidelines for controlling the vectors of 
introduction into the Mediterranean of alien 
species and invasive marine species:  Hull 
fouling. 
 
It was suggested that the documents be reviewed 
for commonalities and uniqueness.  [This action 
was not assigned.] 
 
Jeffery Herod is to supply a report developed by a 
Technical Advisory Group to the California State 
Lands Commission for Ballast Water Performance 
Standards.  This report includes summary of best 
available information and IMO guidelines.

Suggested sources for information included the 
U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Geological Survey 
(USGS), and Richard Emmett at the USCG 
Washington DC office was recommended as a 
contact.  The Northeast Midwest Institute website 
(http://www.nemw.org) summarizes ballast water 
legislation in the U.S. 
 
Dr. Blake Feist has provided contact information 
for USGS work on development of molecular

has occurred (Dr. Rusty Rodriguez, 
USGS/Biological Resources Division, Western 
Fisheries Research Center, ph.: 206-526-6596, e-
mail: rusty_rodriguez@usgs.gov). 
 
The ICES/IOC/IMO Working Group on Ballast 
Waters and Other Ship Vectors (WGBOSV) is in 
the process of developing a Technical Manual for 
Ballast Water Sampling.  It was suggested that a 
draft of the document be distributed to WG 21 
members. 
 
Russian participants indicated that they were 
interested in ballast water sampling methods.  
Responsibility for collecting and summarizing 
available material will be assigned later.  [Action] 
 
TOR#5 Coordinate activities of WG 21 on non-
indigenous aquatic species with related WGs in 
ICES through a joint back-to-back meeting of the 
PICES and ICES Working Groups on invasive 
species in 2007/2008: 
 
The participants agreed that the objectives of the 
coordination of WG 21 and WGITMO and 
WGBOSV activities would be the sharing of 
information and avoidance of duplication of effort.  
This would be facilitated through joint meetings, 
cooperative document development, and post-
meeting information exchange (e.g., through email 
summaries or web postings). 
 
A joint meeting of ICES and PICES Working 
Groups was suggested.  The most viable option 
seemed to be a meeting in conjunction with the 5
th
 
International Marine Bioinvasions Conference 
(May 2007, Cambridge, U.S.A.).  Other possible 
venues include the spring meeting of WGITMO 
and WGBOSV (March 2007, Dobrovnik, Croatia) 
and PICES XVI (October 2007, Victoria, Canada). 
Potential agenda items include:  discussion of 
taxonomic issues and development of taxonomic 
expertise exchanges between ICES and PICES 
member countries;  completion of a ballast water 
sampling technical manual;  development/ 
completion of Codes of Practice for ship hull 
fouling and port sampling;  discussion of rapid 
response and control options;  and consistency of 
information gathered, collated and distributed. 
 
The possibility of using PICES funds to provide 
travel support for WG 21 members was discussed.  
Clarification was to be sought from the PICES 
Executive Secretary. 
 
TOR#6 Develop and recommend an approach 
for formal linkages between PICES and ICES on 
non-indigenous aquatic species: 
 
The participants suggested that (1) ICES and 
PICES Working Groups’ Terms of Reference 
should be shared, and (2) a joint ICES/PICES fund 
for taxonomic specialist exchange be established.  
Dr. Kellermann indicated that ICES would 
seriously consider this. 
 
Other linkages discussed included joint meetings, 
cooperative document development (e.g., ballast 
water sampling guidelines, code of practice for 
hull fouling) and formal communication of 
minutes or meeting reports through e-mail and the 
web. 
 
TOR#7: Publish final report summarizing results 
and recommendations: 
 
Not much discussion took place on this point, and 
no formal dates or targets were set.  WG 21 needs 
to make more progress toward accomplishing the 
Terms of Reference before diving into discussion 
of the final report. 
 
Currently WG 21 has a 3-year mandate ending 
2008.  This is in contrast with WGITMO and 
WGBOSV which have been operating for many 
years.  Depending on the future success of  
WG 21 in achieving its Terms of Reference and 
the extent of interest of PICES member countries, 
PICES may wish to consider creating a Section on 
non-indigenous aquatic species following the 
termination of WG 21.

PICES XVI – Proposal for a Topic Session on 
invasive species (Agenda Item 7) 
 
WG 21 members agreed to propose a full-day 
MEQ Topic Session on non-indigenous species to 
be held at PICES XVI.  During an extensive 
discussion, the following key areas for the session 
were suggested (WG 21 Endnote 3): 
 Evolutionary consequences of invasions:  
“Know too much about ecology? Evolutionary 
consequences of marine NIS invasions on 
native species”.  Studies abound documenting 
ecological impacts (i.e., displacement, 
mortality, etc.) of NIS upon native 
populations, but there are comparatively few 
studies that demonstrate evolutionary impacts.  
As such, abstracts that address the topic of 
evolutionary impacts of NIS on native biota 
have to be solicited, and specifically, these 
abstracts need to demonstrate clear 
evolutionary responses of native species to 
selective pressure from invasive NIS.  For 
example, a NIS invading and displacing a 
native species is an ecological consequence, 
but a native species evolving new anti-
predator defenses in response to the invasion 
of an NIS is an evolutionary response; 
 Ecosystem effects of bioinvasions; 
 Impacts of climate change projections (and 
oceanographic variability) on bioinvasions:  
“Global climate change and its influence on 
the range expansion of NIS, and the amplitude 
and frequency of bioinvasions – it is not just 
for natives anymore”; 
 Criteria used to identify species as native or 
non-native. 
 
A balance must be reached between having too 
many topic areas vs. a very narrow selection that 
would reduce participation.  Submitted abstracts 
that closely adhere to the theme would have priority 
for oral presentation, those that are more generally 
related to NIS can be accommodated for oral 
presentation as space allows or presented as posters. 
 
Travel funds are requested from PICES for 2 
invited speakers to attend the session.  Should the 
session be approved, invited speakers must be 
secured as soon as possible.  A few names were 
suggested (James Carlton, Chad Hewitt, Nicholas 
Bax, John Chapman, Andrew Cohen, David 
Pimentel, David Lodge, Michelle Mack, Daniel 
Simberloff, Ted Grosholz). 
Discussion of potential joint ICES/PICES 
meetings (Agenda Item 8) 
 
Two options for a joint meeting of ICES/PICES 
were discussed.  The first is to take advantage of 
WG 21 members’ participation in the upcoming 5
th
 
International Marine Bioinvasions Conference in 
May 2007 (see Agenda Item 9).  The second is to 
have it in conjunction with PICES XVI in October 
2007.  The following topics for discussion at the 
joint meeting were proposed: 
 ballast water sampling methods; 
 NIS databases; 
 taxonomic challenges; 
 ICES Code of Practice for ship hull fouling; 
 rapid response and control options. 
 
It was suggested that a member of the U.S. 
Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force be invited to 
the joint meeting.  The issue of travel funds was 
raised by a number of WG 21 members. 
 
Fifth International Marine Bioinvasions 
Conference (Agenda Item 9) 
 
Dr. Judith Pederson provided an overview of the 
Conference to be held May 21–24, 2007, in 
Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.A.  Details can be 
found on the Conference website at 
http:/massbay.mit.edu or http://www.mit.edu/ 
mitseagrantweb. Deadline for abstracts submission 
is January 2007.  All WG 21 members are 
encouraged to attend the conference. 
 
Informal round table discussion on priority 
aquatic invasive species issues in PICES-member 
countries (Agenda Item 10) 
 
Canada – Discussion included:  developing data 
standards related to geo-referencing and format 
and coding standards (including taxonomic issues 
related to standard species codes) as they relate to 
information transfer from regional to national 
initiatives; a summary of programs underway 
related to ballast water; bioinvasion biology, 
surveys and monitoring;  risk assessment;  rapid 
response plans and citizen engagement.  Vectors of 
particular concern are ballast water, fouling, live 
seafood and aquarium trades. 
 
China – Priority issues were non-native seagrass 
(Spartina) that invaded from North America in the 
1960s and an exotic bivalve that invaded from 
Appendix 6  WG 21 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  97 
Hong Kong and competes for food resources with 
cultured species. 
 
Japan – Discussion focused on benthic community 
invasion in Tokyo Bay, including high densities of 
Mediterranean [European?] green crab, North 
American spider crab and Atlantic quahog clams.  
Interestingly, these species are dominant in 
polluted areas which limit their interaction with 
native species. 
 
Russia – Priority issues were increased natural 
dispersal of tropical species in response to global 
warming; increased risk of invasion due to 
shipping traffic to a proposed oil terminal;  and 
species of particular concern (tunicates and spionid 
polychaetes). 
 
U.S. – Discussion points included development of 
control management plans;  increased awareness in 
the scientific community of NIS issues (the 
possibility of research projects as vectors);  the 
need to develop information bases for native 
species (as our native is someone else’s invader);  
and the need to be cognizant of potentially large 
ecological effects of relatively small species (e.g., 
Potamocurbula). 
 
Summary of recommendations to MEQ 
 
WG 21 seeks MEQ approval of the following 
recommendations: 
1.  To hold a joint meeting of WG 21 with the 
ICES Working Group on Introductions and 
Transfers of Marine Organisms and the 
ICES/IOC/IMO Working Group on Ballast 
Waters and Other Ship Vectors, in fulfillment 
of one of its Terms of Reference.  The meeting 
would be convened May 25-26, 2007, in 
Cambridge (U.S.A.), immediately following 
the 5
th
 International Marine Bioinvasions 
Conference.  Travel funds from PICES are 
requested to permit 1 Chinese and 1 Russian 
member to attend the Conference and the joint 
meeting. 
 
2. To convene a Topic Session at PICES XVI in 
Victoria, Canada.  This session would focus 
on the following key areas: 
 Evolutionary consequences of invasions; 
 Ecosystem effects of bioinvasions; 
 Impacts of climate change projections 
(and oceanographic variability) on 
bioinvasions; 
Travel funds from PICES are requested for 2 
invited speakers for this session. 
 
3. To request that Russia nominate Dr. Vasily 
Radashevsky as a member of WG 21, and that 
he be named as WG 21 Co-Chairman.

WG 21 Endnote 3 
Proposal for a 1-day MEQ Topic Session at PICES XVI on  
“Non-indigenous species:  Climate change, evolutionary consequences and ecological impacts” 
 
The global community is becoming increasingly 
aware of the importance of invasions of non-
indigenous species in the marine environment.  
The issue is extremely complex.  This session will 
be limited to three sub-topics of interest to PICES 
member countries: 
 
1) Global climate change is further complicating 
the study and prediction of bioinvasions and 
its influence on the range expansion of non-
indigenous species (NIS) and the amplitude 
and frequency of bioinvasions.  This is 
particularly the case in areas where 
bioinvasions have been halted by climatic 
conditions.  We are seeking presentations that 
document the impact of climate change on 
marine bioinvasions. 
2) Studies abound documenting ecological 
impacts (i.e., displacement, mortality, etc.) of 
NIS upon native populations, but there are 
comparatively few studies that demonstrate 
evolutionary impacts.  As such, we are 
soliciting papers that address the topic of 
evolutionary impacts of NIS on native biota, 
and specifically, presentations that demonstrate 
clear evolutionary responses of native species 
to selective pressure from invasive NIS.  For 
example, a NIS invading and displacing a 
native species is an ecological consequence, 
but a native species evolving new anti-predator 
defenses in response to the invasion of a NIS 
is an evolutionary response. 
3) Finally, we seek presentations that show the 
ecological impacts of bioinvasions that have 
led to declines in wild fisheries and 
mariculture. 
 
Recommended convenors:  Blake Feist (U.S.A.) 
and Graham Gillespie (Canada).

PICES Sixteenth Annual Meeting (PICES XVI) 
October 26–November 5, 2007 
Victoria, Canada 
 
 
REPORT OF WG 21 ON NON-INDIGENOUS AQUATIC SPECIES 
            
 
 
The Working Group on Non-Indigenous Aquatic 
Species (hereafter WG 21) held its second meeting 
October 26–27, 2007, under the co-chairmanship of 
Ms. Darlene L. Smith and Dr. Vasily Radashevsky.  
A list of participants and meeting agenda can be 
found in WG 21 Endnotes 1 and 2. 
 
Country/Agency reports (Agenda Items 2) 
 
Canada 
 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) is the federal 
government agency responsible for marine non-
indigenous species in Canada.  The DFO non-
indigenous species program consists of three 
elements:  research, monitoring and risk 
assessment.  DFO has also worked with the 
National Science and Engineering Research 
Council of Canada to establish a national research 
program called the Canadian Aquatic Invasive 
Species Network (CAISN).  CAISN includes 
scientists from 19 Canadian universities and 
several DFO laboratories.  The primary species of 
concern include: European green crab, tunicates 
(5–7 species), New Zealand mudsnail and 
perciform fishes in freshwater. 
 
People’s Republic of China 
 
It is estimated that there are about 140 marine alien 
species in China.  Mariculture and international 
shipping are the two main vectors by which non-
indigenous species are introduced to China.  
Spartina alterniflora and Spartina anglica were 
introduced in 1979 to protected beaches and had 
spread extensively causing major ecological 
damage.  Mytilopsis sallei has also been introduced 
and is causing serious damage to the mariculture 
industry and native species.  Another non-
indigenous species is Crepidula onyx which 
reduces biodiversity and fouls pisciculture cages.  
Some harmful algae blooms species are suspected 
to have been introduced to the China seas via 
ballast water.  They have caused economic losses 
to aquaculture and fisheries operations with serious 
environmental and human health impacts. 
 
China has established the following targets by the 
year 2010: 
 To develop a basic understanding of the 
present status of marine alien invasive species 
in coastal China, such as exotic species and 
their distributions, invasive species distribution 
and impacts, etc.; 
 To establish prevention and control systems 
for marine alien invasive species; 
 To establish methods to assess the impacts of 
marine biological invasions.  
 
By the year 2015, through strengthening the study 
of marine exotic invasive species ecology, a basic 
understanding of mechanisms of invasion will be 
built up.  Meanwhile, technologies for elimination 
and control of invasive species will be developed 
to control or reduce the impacts resulting from a 
few dominant invasive species. 
 
Republic of Korea 
 
In 2007, harmful algal blooms (HABs) occurred 
from August–September (a total of 44 days).  
These included Cochlodinium polykrikoides from 
the South Sea to Japan/East Sea, and Chattonella 
spp. in Chonsu Bay (Yellow Sea).  Total damage 
was about $US 12 million, mostly to halibut, red 
bream, etc. 
 
Research activities associated with HABs and 
invasive species include: 
 Rapid detection of Cochlodinium using 
sandwich hybridization and whole cell 
hybridization; 
 Development of molecular techniques for 
detection of Pfiesteria and Pfiesteria-like sp.; 
 National Census of Marine Ecosystem 
(conducted by “Law of Marine Ecosystem 
Conservation and Management”; the 1
st
 phase is 
WG 21 Annual Reports Appendix 6 
100  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
from 2006–2015 (10yrs), and the budget of 
US$1.5 million for 2007); 
 National Institute of Marine Bioresources 
(established by “Law of Marine Ecosystem 
Conservation and Management”; the 
construction period is from 2007–2013 (5yrs), 
with the total budget of US $150 million, and 
the budget of US$ 25 million for 2008); 
 Marine invasive species:  Preparation of 
“Manual for Field Study”; barnacle monitoring 
(Ulsan port, Guryongpo port);  general 
observation at Baekryung Is. (Yellow Sea), 
Ulreung Is. (Japan/East Sea) and Chuja Is. 
(South Sea); 
 Development of ballast water treatment and 
monitoring (conducted by KORDI under 
“Marine Environment Management Law”, 
with the budget of US$ 0.2 million); 
 Development of ballast water treatment system 
and preparation of “Field Manual of Ballast 
Water Monitoring”. 
 
Russia 
 
The current status of non-indigenous fish species 
distribution and abundance in Peter the Great Bay 
was given.  There are 19 non-indigenous fish 
species found in this area.  The general conclusions 
of this work are: 
 A composition of non-indigenous fish species 
in the estuaries of Peter the Great Bay was 
determined.  Due to a significant part in 
biomass of all the fishes (e.g., 10% and 13% in 
the ichthyofauna of Artemovka and 
Razdolnaya Rivers, respectively), they are of 
great importance in the functioning of estuary 
ichthyocenes of the rivers. 
 In the early 2000s, Khanka bitterlings 
Acanthorodeus chankaensis, lookup Culter 
alburnus, lazy gudgeon Sarcocheilchthys 
czerskii, Sarcocheilchthys sp., Soldatov’s 
catfish Silurus soldatovi, European pike-perch 
Sander lucioperca and northern snakehead 
Channa argus were introduced into the 
Razdolnaya River. 
 Silver carp, bigheads, grass carp and European 
pike-perch form ephemeral, not numerous 
populations that include only adult individuals.  
Rounded gudgeon, Khanka bitterlings, 
Acanthorodeus sp., Korean sawbelly, lazy 
gudgeon, northern snakehead and lookup have 
formed independent populations in 
Razdolnaya River.  The quantity of lookup in 
Razdolnaya River has now reached a 
commercial value. 
 
United States of America 
 
Three main agencies in the United States are 
responsible for managing marine invasive species: 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA), Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
(F&WS).  Some of the major invaders on the U.S. 
Pacific Coast are: 
 European green crab (dominant competitor; 
regulates the structure of benthic communities 
through predation; at high densities limits the 
distribution of some benthic invertebrates); 
 Various species of tunicates (high potential for 
environmental and ecosystem damage; 
overgrow and displace native sea grasses, 
sponges, hydroids, anemones, limpets, oysters, 
mussels, scallops, barnacles, bryozoans, and 
other species of sea squirts;  negative effects 
on aquaculture industry); 
 Snowflake coral (threatens Hawai’i’s $30-
million-a-year black coral industry; hull 
fouling and aquarium trade). 
 
NOAA along with the U.S. F&WS, and the U.S. 
Maritime Administration, in cooperation with 
various States, conducts research on ballast water 
treatment technologies at two facilities, one located 
at the Great Lakes and one located in NOAA’s 
North West Region. 
 
The Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force, headed 
by NOAA and the U.S. F&WS, supports 
development of management plans for aquatic 
nuisance species in the United States.  Resources 
for research are limited, with the majority going 
towards management.  A major focus now is rapid 
response planning.  Hazard Analysis of Critical 
Control Point (HACCP) is currently being 
investigated as a model for responding to invasive 
species. 
 
EPA is focused on the results of a recent court 
decision requiring the Agency to regulate ballast 
water discharge, including all boats with outboard 
motors.  EPA will use the discharge standards of 
the International Maritime Organization. 
 
Dr. Mark Sytsma gave a presentation on the status 
of a Spartina spp. invasion on the Pacific coast of 
Appendix 6  WG 21 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  101 
the United States and provided details of the 
management and eradication programs. 
 
Science presentations (Agenda Item 3) 
 
Three presentations were given by WG 21 
members from the People’s Republic of China, the 
Russian Federation and Japan: 
 
 Lijun Wang:  Assessment of the genetic impact 
of introduced Strongylocentratus intermedius 
on native sea urchin populations; 
 Vasily Radashevsky:  Studies on invasive 
species in the Far-Eastern Part of Russia; 
 Hiroshi Kawai:  Biogeography and trans-
ocean introductions of the green algae Ulva 
spp. from/to Japan, deduced from the 
identifications based on molecular markers. 
 
WG 21 terms of reference (Agenda Item 4) 
 
WG 21 proposes to amend its terms of reference to 
reflect practical constraints on the work and the 
two projects funded with the Japanese voluntary 
contribution (WG 21 Endnote 3). These were 
submitted for approval to the MEQ Committee. 
 
Joint PICES-ICES meeting summary and 
further co-operation (Agenda Item 5) 
 
Dr. Judith Pederson provided the summary of the 
joint meeting of PICES WG 21, ICES WG on 
Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms 
(WGITMO) and ICES/IOC/IMO WG on Ballast 
and Other Ship Vectors, (WGBOSBV) held May 
25–26, 2007, in Cambridge, U.S.A., with emphasis 
on the following points: 
 Potential projects for “Development of the 
prevention systems for harmful organism’s 
expansion in the Pacific Rim”; 
 Lack of taxonomic expertise limiting ICES-
PICES exchange; 
 Need for the registry of taxonomic experts; 
 Adding AIS (Aquatic Invasive Species) data 
based on NISBase; 
 Use bivalve molluscs for database testing; 
 Ballast water and biofouling as potential 
vectors; 
 ICES Ballast Water Sampling Guidelines – 
review of ballast water issues, including early 
detection, rapid response, impacts, costs, 
successes, and failures from world-wide 
examples; role of government and citizens in 
an EDRR (Early Detection and Rapid 
Response) system. 
 
Suggestions for future co-operation include: 
 ICES Code of Practice for the Introduction and 
Transfer of Marine Organisms; 
 Risk assessments or analysis; 
 Guidelines for sampling ballast water; 
 Other areas for joint projects, including hull 
fouling. 
 
Database prototype (Agenda Item 6) 
 
The morning session of the second day opened 
with a presentation on the WG 21 marine non-
indigenous species (MNIS) database prototype that 
Dr. Henry Lee II and Ms. Deborah Reusser had 
developed based on the EPA-USGS PCEIS 
(Pacific Coast Ecosystem Information System) 
spatial database.  Dr. Lee gave an overview of the 
database that is designed to provide biological, 
ecological and geo-spatial information.  Each 
attendee received a copy of the manual and a disk 
with the program.  The initial exercise is to enter 
invasive bivalves of the North Pacific for testing 
the prototype database.  With the database, species 
information can be entered, edited, and exported.  
With the input of standardized data across the 
countries, the data are easily queried.  The morning 
session focused on the details of using the database 
and issues that arose during the discussion.  The 
major items and action items or conclusions that 
emerged from the discussion are described below. 
 
The database uses Microsoft Access as the 
software for developing relationships among the 
various components, and this poses a problem for 
Macintosh users who rely on FileMaker as the 
database management software. 
 
Action item:  Determine how to link File Maker to 
Access.  
 
The prototype is built so that members from each 
PICES country can enter and maintain their own 
database.  The main menu offers a variety of 
options: searching for species, adding/editing 
species, adding publications, exporting and 
importing data, documentation, acknowledge-
ments, and exiting.  One of the important decisions 
to be made by the group was the level of 
biographic detail that would be captured by the 
program.  The Nature Conservancy biogeography 
WG 21 Annual Reports Appendix 6 
102  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
regions were used as the basis for making 
decisions.  The bio-geographic hierarchy extends 
from the North Temperate Pacific Realm > 
Provinces > Eco-region > Waterbody Eco-region > 
Sub-component in Waterbody > Site Specific 
(latitude/longitude). 
 
Consensus decision is to:  (1) extend to the 
Waterbody Eco-region and sub-divisions as this 
would permit analysis of the data appropriate to 
the scale for PICES countries; and (2) include 
latitudes and longitudes as database fields. 
 
Adding a reference with each species, either as a 
publication or as the name of the person entering 
the data, is required.  The program has several 
features that make entering the data easier, 
including options for removing and editing data, 
accessing publication data, adding relevant 
ecosystem and MNIS data, and viewing and 
extracting data.  In order to test the database, it was 
initially suggested that each country would input 
data on bivalves, however, some countries may 
add other data, e.g., barnacles.  Each country will 
input data and a training workshop on use of the 
database will be held to walk through the revised 
protocols.  For several countries, it would take 
time to identify the individuals who would input 
the data. 
 
Action item:  Each country will input data over the 
next couple of months and correspond with Ms. 
Reusser if any problems are encountered.  Ideally 
the data entry should be completed before 
December 31, 2007. 
 
Consensus decision is:  to hold a workshop to 
evaluate the protocols and reach final agreement 
on standards, data elements and data entry 
templates for the MNIS database on January 30–
31, 2008, in Seattle, U.S.A. 
 
Action item:  Each country is to submit names of 
two representatives to be invited to attend the 
workshop to Ms. Smith by November 30, 2007, 
especially countries where visas are needed. 
 
Update:  Dates and location were changed to 
March 3–5, 2008 in Busan, Korea. 
 
Planning for PICES XVII (Agenda Item 7) 
 
WG 21 proposed a 1-day Topic Session (including 
posters) on marine non-indigenous species to be 
held at PICES XVII (WG 21 Endnote 4).  This 
session will focus on ecological and economic 
impacts of marine non-indigenous species and 
ballast water technologies.  Potential invited 
speakers are:  David Pimentel, Andrew Cohen, 
James Carlton, Daniel Simberloff (for the Eastern 
Pacific) and Jiakuan Chen (for the Western 
Pacific). 
 
Work plan for database and taxonomy 
initiatives (Agenda Item 8) 
 
In April 2007, the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan, through 
the Fisheries Agency (JFA) of Japan, provided a 
voluntary contribution to PICES for a project 
entitled “Development of the prevention systems 
for harmful organisms’ expansion in the Pacific 
Rim”.  The project is anticipated to run for five 
years (from April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2012).  It 
has two distinct components, one on MNIS and the 
other on HABs conducted by WG 21 and Section on 
Ecology of Harmful Algal Blooms in the North 
Pacific (HAB-S), respectively. 
 
Within the MNIS sub-project, two initiatives have 
been identified:  (1) development of a MNIS 
database; and (2) development of a taxonomic 
system to allow identification and documentation 
of MNIS establishment outside of their native 
range.  Details for activities under the Database 
Initiative are outlined in Agenda Item 6.  Under the 
Taxonomic Initiative, WG 21 proposes to conduct 
a rapid MNIS assessment survey in each PICES 
member country.  These assessments will focus on 
two port locations within the member country 
hosting the PICES Annual Meeting and be held 
immediately prior to the Annual Meeting, using 
taxonomic experts and students from the host 
country and Pacific Rim experts as needed.  The 
first rapid assessment survey is scheduled for 
October 19–23, 2008, in conjunction with PICES 
XVII. The proposed surveys will be complemented 
by sub-tidal collectors for biofouling organisms 
deployed at selected sites in PICES member 
countries.  A revised work plan for 2008–2009 can 
be found in WG 21 Endnote 5. 
 
Appendix 6  WG 21 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  103 
Sixth International Marine Bioinvasions 
Conference (Agenda Item 9) 
 
Dr. Gil Rilov presented an overview of the 6
th
 
International Conference on “Marine bioinvasions” 
to be held in late August or early September 2009, 
at Portland State University (PSU), Portland, 
Oregon, U.S.A.  Dr. Sytsma will serve as the local 
host. 
 
The Marine bioinvasions Conference has focused 
on scientific and management issues related to 
marine introductions and focused on vectors, 
distribution, ecological impacts and evolutionary 
consequences, and related topics.  The Conference 
also continues to identify new topics and emerging 
issues.  As with the 5
th
 Conference, co-sponsorship 
by the U.S. National Sea Grant Office, the 
International Council for the Exploration of the 
Sea (ICES) and PICES is welcome.  Planning for 
the Conference is still in the initial stages.  WG 21 
is interested in supporting the Conference and 
requested to have a representative on the Scientific 
Steering Committee (SSC).  Dr. Yoon Lee (Korea) 
volunteered to serve on the SSC.  It was also 
suggested to propose that a special session on 
Pacific Rim invasive species be included in the 
program.  Conference organizers requested the 
following financial support from PICES: 
 2007–08 Fiscal Year $10,000 
 2008–09 Fiscal Year $10,000 
 2009–10 Fiscal Year $30,000 
 
Aquatic invasive species/climate change 
connection (Agenda Item 10) 
 
How can WG 21 promote further discussion and/or 
research regarding the aquatic invasive 
species/climate change connection in the North 
Pacific?  Dr. Paul Heimowitz raised this as an 
important upcoming issue and advised that the 
American Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force 
will be discussing this issue at its meeting on 
November 27, 2007.  The state of research on this 
issue is still in its infancy.  The ICES WGITMO 
has provided some information relating invasions 
to current and temperature changes to OSPAR 
Commission.  Discussion concluded that 
researchers will have to focus on this issue in the 
future and that there will be a need to distinguish 
between expansion range of non-indigenous 
species and expansion range of native species. 
 
Next WG 21 meeting (Agenda Item 11) 
 
WG 21 members propose to meet for two days at 
PICES XVII in Dalian, China.  The purpose of this 
meeting will be to: 
 review the draft report due at the end of WG 
21’s current mandate; 
 review progress of the database project and 
develop a work plan for Year 3; and 
 review progress of the taxonomy project 
(including the rapid assessment survey) and 
develop a work plan for Year 3. 
 
The Co-Chairmen closed the meeting by thanking 
everyone for their full participation, and by giving 
special thanks to the meeting guests who provided 
valuable input.

WG 21 Endnote 4 
Proposal for a 1- day Topic Session at PICES XVII on  
“Consequences of non-indigenous species introductions” 
 
Non-indigenous species (NIS) are ubiquitous 
throughout the World’s marine, coastal and 
estuarine waters. There is little doubt that human 
mediated dispersal of NIS and subsequent 
establishment of NIS has altered biodiversity, 
species assemblages, food web dynamics, and 
trophic structure and interactions in marine 
ecosystems. These alterations have ecological, 
biological, evolutionary and economic 
consequences, especially in coastal and estuarine 
systems. It is ironic that mariculture and the global 
shipping trade have been identified as the most 
affected economically, given that these two 
activities are often identified as the primary 
vectors of marine NIS introductions. This session 
will address the impacts of marine NIS on the 
ecosystems in which they have invaded. Examples 
of impacts include, but are not limited to, 
Appendix 6  WG 21 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  105 
biological, ecological, evolutionary, and economic. 
While abstracts addressing any type of economic 
impact will be considered, preference will be given 
to research projects focusing on ballast water and 
bio-fouling diagnostic and treatment technologies.

DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE MNIS DATABASE 
 
Principal Investigator  
 
Dr. Henry Lee II (Environment and Protection 
Agency, U.S.A.) 
 
Database development 
 
A template for standards and elements of relevant 
scientific data (scientific and common names, 
native range distribution and invasion range 
distribution(s), life histories, habitat requirements, 
ecological roles, impacts of invasions, and 
management and mitigation measures undertaken 
in invaded countries) will be developed and 
documented, based on the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the 
United States Geological Survey (USGS) “Pacific 
Coast Ecosystem Information System” (PCEIS) 
spatial database. 
Beta testing of the database 
 
Focus will be on entry of data for a pilot NIS taxon 
(bivalves) by all PICES member countries.  In 
situations where limited NIS bivalve data exist, 
another NIS taxa or native data will be used for 
testing purposes.  Potential limitations identified 
through this exercise will be discussed at the 
proposed inter-sessional meeting. 
 
Meeting to obtain consensus on database format, 
standards and elements 
 
An inter-sessional meeting of WG 21 will be held 
after beta testing is completed (mid-winter 2008, in 
either Seattle, U.S.A. or Korea) to evaluate the 
database protocol and to reach final agreement on 
standards, data elements and data entry templates. 
 
 
RAPID ASSESSMENT SURVEYS IN PICES MEMBER COUNTRIES 
 
Principal Investigator 
 
Dr. Thomas Therriault (Fisheries and Oceans 
Canada) 
 
Purpose 
 
Non-indigenous species (NIS) have the potential to 
alter habitats and biological diversity and can have 
economic and ecological impacts.  There is a need 
for good taxonomy and consistency for sampling 
approaches in PICES member countries and other 
Pacific Rim countries.  To better understand MNIS 
in PICES member countries, rapid assessment 
surveys will be carried out to gather and compare 
species information among countries.  We have a 
unique opportunity at the 2008 PICES Annual 
Meeting in Dalian, China, to conduct the first rapid 
assessment survey and include taxonomic experts 
and students from each member country.  If 
successful, this would be repeated in subsequent 
years in each PICES country the year they host the 
PICES Annual Meeting.  All data collected would 
be entered into the PICES MNIS database being 
developed by WG 21. 
 
Rapid assessment survey scope  
 
Two separate locations in each country will be 
selected.  Locations will be determined by the host 
country and could include areas near international 
shipping ports and aquaculture facilities as these 
are two major vectors for the introduction of 
marine non-indigenous species.  Within each of the 
two locations, three different habitats will be 
selected for rapid assessment: 
WG 21 Annual Reports Appendix 6 
106  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
 intertidal habitat; 
 floating docks/structures (e.g., aquaculture 
facilities) that support subtidal biofouling 
organisms; and  
 pilings/piers associated with commercial 
shipping activities that support biofouling 
organisms. 
 
A total of six sampling sites will be assessed 
during the survey characterizing both the native 
and non-native species using available taxonomic 
experts.  All species encountered during the survey 
(or found on collectors or in traps) will be 
identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible.  
For 2008, it is suggested to focus the survey on 
Dalian Port (Yellow Sea) and Ba Yu Quan (Bohai 
Sea) as both are close to the Annual Meeting site 
and represent two different marine environments.  
The proposed locations have to be confirmed by 
the State Oceanic Administration. 
 
Methods 
 
The proposed project will examine community 
assemblages in both intertidal and subtidal habitats 
through two components: 
 
The first component is sampling native and non-
native species in various marine habitats such as: 
 intertidal shoreline; 
 commercial shipping piers or docks;  
 floating structures such as aquaculture 
facilities; and  
 baited traps to sample mobile fauna such as 
decopods (e.g., crabs). 
 
The second component will capture settlement of 
biofouling organisms over a period of 6 months.  
To do this we will: 
 deploy settlement plates and collectors 
6 months prior to the rapid assessment survey 
to sample subtidal biofouling communities; 
 other PICES member countries wishing to do 
so, may also deploy settlement plates and 
collectors at the same time to provide 
additional information for comparison. 
 
Previous rapid assessment surveys in the United 
States have used standardized methods and they 
may be referred to for establishing a protocol for 
PICES member countries.  Two examples can be 
found in the following papers: 
 Cohen, A.N. et al. (2000) Report of the 
Washington State Exotics Expedition 2000: A 
rapid assessment survey of exotic species in 
Elliot Bay, Totten/Eld Inlets and Willapa Bay. 
In:  Washington State Department of Natural 
Resources, Olympia WA, pp. 46. 
 Cohen, A.N. et al. (2005) Rapid assessment 
survey for exotic organisms in southern 
California bays and harbors, and abundance in 
port and non-port areas. Biological Invasions 
7: 995–1002. 
 
Required resources 
 
Each rapid assessment survey will require the 
participation of the PICES host country’s taxonomic 
experts representing the variety of non-indigenous 
marine taxa that have had significant negative 
ecological or economic consequences.  These may 
include taxonomists specializing in ascidians 
(tunicates), crustaceans (crabs, barnacles, 
amphipods), mollusks (gastropods, bivalves), 
worms (polychaetes), cnidarians (hydroids, 
anemones) and algae.  Taxonomic experts and 
students (primarily from the host country) who are 
familiar with these groups will form the bulk of the 
assessment team.  The rest of the team could include 
experts from PICES member countries and other 
Pacific Rim countries.  Representatives from other 
PICES member countries who will be involved in 
future rapid assessments should also participate.  
This approach ensures that highly qualified 
individuals confirm species identification while 
allowing training for students and taxonomic 
generalists.  The list of experts from the host 
country should be provided 6 months in advance of 
the rapid assessment survey to permit sufficient time 
to identify additional required experts from other 
countries.  Judith Pederson, Chairman of the ICES 
Working Group on Introductions and Transfers of 
Marine Organisms, will serve as a resource person 
for this project. 
 
Vehicles will be needed to transport the rapid 
assessment survey team to sampling sites.  A small 
boat will be required to access potential 
floating/pier sites.  The following sampling gears 
will be needed:  (1) standard plankton nets for 
sampling phytoplankton and zooplankton;   
(2) standard traps (Fukui folding traps?) and 
groundlines for sampling decapods; and (3) tools 
(rakes, shovels, screens) to sample intertidal 
infaunal organisms.  SCUBA divers, if available, 
Appendix 6  WG 21 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  107 
could be used to sample subtidal species, but this is 
optional.  Laboratory facilities with compound 
light microscopes and stereoscopes (dissecting 
scopes) will be required.  Specimens will be 
photographed.  Preliminary identifications are 
made in the field.  However, all samples are taken 
back to a laboratory for verification and archiving.  
Some effort should be made to identify in advance 
and provide taxonomic reference books for each 
country (some may have to be purchased). 
Funding 
 
Travel and accommodation expenses for 
taxonomic experts and students will be covered 
under the taxonomy initiative of the MNIS project 
funded by a voluntary contribution from the 
Japanese government.

MEQ Topic Session (S8) 
Consequences of non-indigenous species introductions 
 
Co-Convenors: Blake Feist (U.S.A.) and Mingyuan Zhu (China) 
 
Background  
 
Non-indigenous species (NIS) are ubiquitous throughout the world’s marine, coastal and estuarine 
waters.  There is little doubt that human-mediated dispersal of NIS and subsequent establishment of NIS has 
altered biodiversity, species assemblages, food web dynamics, and trophic structure and interactions in marine 
ecosystems.  These alterations have ecological, biological, evolutionary and economic consequences, 
especially in coastal and estuarine systems of all PICES member countries.  It is ironic that mariculture and the 
global shipping trade have been identified as the most affected economically, given that these two activities are 
often identified as the primary vectors of marine NIS introductions.  While there are many threats to the biota 
and ecosystem integrity of the North Pacific, the threat of marine NIS is arguably the least understood.  
 
Summary of presentations 
 
The presentations covered a variety of marine NIS topics relevant to all PICES member countries.  The central 
themes included biogeography, potential and observed impacts, monitoring, vectors, and rapid response. There 
were a total of 17 oral presentations and 1 poster prepared for this session, with representation from each 
PICES member country.   
 
The invited speaker, Dr. Edwin “Ted” Grosholz (Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University 
of California, Davis, U.S.A.) started the session by providing an overview of marine NIS consequences in 
coastal and nearshore systems. The consequences he described ran the gamut of spatio-temporal scales, 
ranging from community up through ecosystem levels. His presentation set the stage for the remaining talks as 
he touched on impacts (socio-economic as well as ecological), vectors, case studies, and policy/management 
implications. 
 
The second presentation was an overview of biogeographic patterns of invasion in near-coastal and estuarine 
communities in the Northeast Pacific (NEP) based on surveys by the U.S. EPA’s Environmental Monitoring 
and Assessment Program (EMAP) and the EPA/USGS synthesis of native and non-native species in the 
“Pacific Coast Ecosystem Information System” (PCEIS) database. This was followed by a series of four 
presentations that addressed vectors of introduction. These included: the occurrence of non-indigenous 
polychaetes in Russian ports; the origin, expansion, and fate of introduced populations of non-indigenous 
macroalgae (from East Asia including Japan, Oceania, North America, etc.); distribution, origin and vectors of 
marine NIS on the Pacific coast of Canada; and, spatio-temporal variability in the abundance and size of 
Nemopilema nomurai in Korean waters, with implications for vectors. 
 
The next four presentations were organized around an impacts (potential and documented) theme. The 
presentations covered topics including: changes in the biogeography of harmful dinoflagellates and 
raphidophytes along the Chinese coast, as well as strong northward shifts in the spatial distribution of 
Phaeocystis globosa and Karenia mikimotoi blooms; consequences of NIS that have been introduced for 
Appendix 6  WG 21 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48  109 
marine aquaculture in China, including secondary introductions such as pathogens; the range expansion and 
potential community level impacts of European green crab on the Pacific coast of Canada; and, impediments 
of  native Olympia oyster recovery due to interactions with non-indigenous aquatic species along coastal 
Oregon. 
 
Following these presentations, we learned about the application of  autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) 
for detecting invasive tunicate prevalence in deeper marine waters; rapid response plans and their utility in 
quickly eradicating newly discovered NIS; coupling of individual based models (IBMs) with existing 3D 
ocean circulation models for predicting the northward range expansion of European green crab along the west 
coast of North America; and, Dr. Thomas Therriault presented results from a multi-year, interdisciplinary 
program for identifying, tracking and understanding biological and economic impacts of NIS in Canada. 
 
Dr. Darlene Smith, Co-Chair of Working Group on Non-indigenous Aquatic Species (WG 21), introduced the 
final two presentations. These presentations showcased two of the major products from the Working Group: 
the Rapid Assessment Surveys in PICES member country ports and the North Pacific NIS database (supported 
by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan). The Rapid Assessment Surveys have been 
coordinated by Dr. Thomas Therriault (DFO Canada) and they provide valuable information about the 
prevalence of marine NIS in ports around the Pacific. Dr. Deborah Reusser and Dr. Henry Lee, II have led 
development of the North Pacific non-indigenous species database, which is a spatially explicit database of all 
known NIS occurrences in all PICES member countries.

REPORT OF WG 21 ON NON-INDIGENOUS AQUATIC SPECIES 
 
The Working Group on Non-Indigenous Aquatic Species (hereafter WG 21) held its third meeting October 24–25, 
2008, under the co-chairmanship of Ms. Darlene L. Smith and Dr. Vasily Radashevsky.  A list of participants 
and meeting agenda can be found in WG 21 Endnotes 1 and 2. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 2 
Taxonomy initiative 
 
In 2007, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan, through the Fisheries Agency of 
Japan, provided funding to PICES for a project entitled “Development of the prevention systems for harmful 
organisms’ expansion in the Pacific Rim” to develop international systems to collect, exchange and store 
relevant data. The project is anticipated to run for 5 years (from April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2012). 
 
The project is made up of two components, one on marine non-indigenous species (MNIS) conducted by WG 
21 and one on harmful algal blooms conducted by the Section on Ecology of Harmful Algal Blooms in the 
North Pacific (HAB-S). The MNIS sub-project is divided into two initiatives, one on the development of a 
MNIS database and the other on a taxonomic system to allow identification and documentation of MNIS 
establishment outside of their native habitat. The latter initiative, which is being led by Dr. Thomas Therriault, 
consists of four key elements: (1) the identification of taxanomic needs in PICES member countries, (2) the 
carrying out of rapid assessment surveys, (3) the initiation of standardized collector plate surveys, and (4) the 
development of taxonomic information system/tools.  
 
The first WG 21 Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS) to assess the presence of non-indigenous species was 
conducted from September 20–23, 2008, in Dalian, China. Dr. Lijun Wang of the National Marine 
Environmental Monitoring Center, SOA, was the local organizer. In addition to Drs. Therriault and Wang, the 
RAS team included Dr. Graham Gillespie (Pacific Biological Station, Canada) and Ms. Darlene Smith 
(National Headquarters, Fisheries and Oceans Canada); Dr. Hiroshi Kawai (University of Kobe, Japan);  Dr. Li 
Zheng and Mr. Zhisong Cui (First Institute of Oceanography, SOA, China); Drs. Vasily Radashevsky, Eduard 
Titlyanov, Tamara Titlyanova (Institute of Marine Biology, FEB RAS, Russia) and Dr. Liudmila Budnikova 
(Pacific Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography, Russia); Drs. Blake Feist (Northwest Fisheries 
Science Center, NMFS, U.S.A.) and Judith Pederson (MIT Sea Grant Program, U.S.A.). 
 
Two commercial ports (Dalian on the Yellow Sea and Bayu Quan on the Bohai Sea) were sampled by Dr 
Wang prior to the RAS. A third site, Ling Shui Qiao Beach, Dalian, was sampled by RAS participants on 
October 22, 2008.  A total of 59 species were identified in Dalian Port, 29 species in Bayu Quan Port, and 60 
on Ling Shui Qiao Beach. Dr. Therriault will produce a formal report of the Dalian RAS and will provide a 
written protocol for the RAS and collector plate surveys at a later date. Canada will provide collectors to 
countries wishing to deploy collector plates, and all data from the rapid assessment and collector plate surveys 
will be entered into the non-indigenous species database. 
 
Professor Toshio Furota presented the results of a rapid assessment survey he conducted in Tokyo Bay, Japan.  
In summary, two sites were sampled; the Port of Tokyo and Piers off Haneda Airport in the inner Tokyo Bay.  
A total of 67 species and/or taxonomic groups were identified of which 15 are considered non-indigenous.  
The complete report from the Tokyo Bay rapid assessment survey can be found in WG 21 Endnote 3. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 3 
Non-indigenous species database 
 
The second sub-project funded by MAFF (see Agenda Item 2) was the development of a comprehensive MNIS 
database led by Dr. Henrey Lee II (U.S. Environment and Protection Agency, U.S.A.) and Ms. Deborah 
WG 21 Annual Reports Appendix 6 
112  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
Reusser (USGS-Western Fisheries Research Center at Marine Hatfield Science Center, U.S.A.). This initiative 
involves the development and population of a database of marine/estuarine species that can be queried for 
distributional, ecological, and physiological data at different taxonomic levels and spatial distributions. The 
database includes: species, a hierarchal biogeography at the realm, province and ecoregion level, ecosystem type, 
salinity, life history and development, habitat, temperature, trophic level and feeding, amd invasion vectors.  
 
A working copy version of the database was distributed to all WG 21 members at the meeting and assistance 
was provided by Ms. Reusser to ensure that it was successfully installed. January 2009 was established as the 
deadline for entry and submission of existing non-indigenous species by countries to Ms Reusser. The final 
version database, complete with query and output functions, picture storage, PDF storage and automated 
import utilities, will be completed by October 2009.  Additional data entry and a possible web-based 
application will be discussed at PICES-2009 in Jeju, Korea. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 4 
WG 21 revised terms of reference 
 
Given the refocusing of WG 21’s work on the two MAFF-funded projects, WG 21 reviewed its current terms 
of reference and revised them (WG 21 Endnote 4) to reflect content and duration of the activities (WG 21 
Endnote 5) under these projects. They were submitted to the MEQ Committee for approval. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 5 
6
th
 International Conference on Marine Bioinvasions 
 
Dr. Judith Pederson presented information on the 6
th
 International Conference on Marine Bioinvasions to be 
held August 24–29, 2009 in Portland, Oregon, U.S.A.  The Conference is entitled “Marine bioinvaders: Agents 
of change in a changing world” and details can be found at http://www.clr.pdx.edu/mbic. The  themes are: 
 Ecological and evolutionary impacts, including potential shifts with global change; 
 Predicting the scale and diversity of invasions in the face of global change; 
 Measuring and predicting spread on regional and global scales; 
 Invasion patterns over time and space: does the past predict the future? 
 Advances in detection, identification and tracking-to-origin capabilities; 
 Management, rapid response, eradication and restoration.  
 
The conference organizers are seeking financial support from PICES.  Dr. Therriault volunteered to serve as a 
member of the conference’s scientific steering committee.  Dr. Yoon Lee (Korea) is already a member. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 6 
Possible cooperation between the Northwest Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP) and PICES 
 
Dr. Jeung Sook Park, Scientific Affairs Officer of NOWPAP Regional Coordination Unit, presented a 
statement on possible cooperation between NOWPAP and PICES. WG 21 reviewed it and concluded that 
while sharing information is desirable, there were insufficient details to make a recommendation to MEQ. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 7 
Recommendations 
The Working Group recommends that the MEQ Committee approve: 
a. The revised terms of reference, with deliverables and milestones; 
b. Extend the lifespan of WG 21 until PICES-2012 (October 2012) to reflect the duration of the MAFF 
funding; 
Appendix 6  WG 21 Annual Reports

Observation Locations and Methods 
 
A. Port of Tokyo    
1. Suspended artificial panels (32×55 cm black acrylic) from a floating dock at Museum of Maritime 
Science in Port of Tokyo. Every 1 m deep form 1 m to 4 m near bottom. Established on 
 
May 11, 2008, 
and observed on September 22, 2008.  
2. Hand collection in intertidal and subtidal bottoms by SCUBA  at Daiba Beach and Museum of Maritime 
Science in Port of Tokyo. Conducted on September 15,  2008. 
    
B. Piers Off Haneda Airport inner Tokyo Bay 
 1. Hand collection by SCUBA divers.  Surface to bottom (20 m), conducted on July 15, 2008. 
 
Preservation and identification 
  
All samples were preserved in 10 % neutralized see-water formalin. 
 
Conclusion 
 
A total of 67 species and/or taxonomic groups were identified. Among them, 17 species were judged to non-
indigenous species, which consisted mainly of sessile species, except for 4 free-living ones; an Atlantic clam, 
Mericenaria marcenaria, a mud amphipod, Monocorophium insidosum, a small spider crab, Pyromaia 
tuberculata, and a Mediterranean green crab, Carcinus aestuarii This strongly indicates that the benthic 
community in inner Tokyo Bay had been dominated by invasive species. Four major vectors of marine 
invasion with human activities had been suggested; attaching on ship hauls, sea chests, ballast waters, and 
intentional or unintentional transplantation with imported fishery species. Action to prevent the marine 
invasion has not been conducted in Japan. These suggest that there is a possibility of further invasions of 
marine organisms into the bay, and this will cause change of the benthic community in Tokyo Bay. Monitoring 
observation for next invasion could be required.

REPORT OF WG 21 ON NON-INDIGENOUS AQUATIC SPECIES 
 
 
The fourth annual meeting of the Working Group on Non-Indigenous Aquatic Species (hereafter WG 21) was held 
under the co-chairmanship of Ms. Darlene L. Smith from October 23–24, 2009.  There was participation from 
all PICES countries and guests from ICES WGITMO, IOC WESTPAC and NOWPAP.  Twenty-five WG-21 
members and guests attended the meeting (WG 21 Endnote 1).  The meeting agenda can be found in WG 21 
Endnote 2.  
 
AGENDA ITEM 2 
2009 inter-sessional highlights 
 
WG 21 was active throughout the year planning working group activities and interacting with other 
multilateral organizations.  The following are the highlights of these activities: 
 Dr. Thomas Therriault, the Principal Investigator of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of 
Japan (MAFF) funded Taxonomy Initiative visited Busan and Jeju Island, Korea, in March 2009 to plan a 
collector plate and Rapid Assess Survey (RAS).  This ultimately resulted in a very successful RAS in Jeju 
(see PICES Press Vol. 18, No. 1, pp. 38–40).  WG 21 conducted a 4-day (October 19–22, 2009) RAS in 
Jeju prior to the PICES Annual Meeting.  Participants were from 5 PICES member countries (Canada, 
Japan, Korea, Russia and United States) as well as from ICES WGITMO and IOC WESTPAC.  Collectors 
from 4 locations (Busan, Ulsan, Masan and Jang Mok) analyzed the samples at the Jeju Biodiversity 
Institute.  Field sampling was conducted at Seongsan Beach.  Analysis is being finalized and will be 
entered into the database.  Working Group members, Drs. Junghoon Kang and Kyoungsoon Shin of 
KORDI, were instrumental in the success of this exercise and WG 21 thanks them. 
 Ms. Darlene Smith was invited to give a presentation on WG 21’s activities at an IOC WESTPAC 
workshop on “Marine invasive species and management in the western Pacific region” in Bangkok, 
Thailand (June 4–5, 2009).  This resulted in a formal invitation and acceptance for IOC WESTPAC to 
attend the WG 21 meeting as an observer at PICES-2009.  It is also likely that IOC WESTPAC 
representatives will participate in the demonstration workshop on “An introduction to rapid assessment 
survey methodologies for application in developing countries” to be hosted by Japan in July 2010. 
 PICES co-sponsored the 6
th
 International Conference on Marine Bioinvasions held in Portland, Oregon, 
from August 24–29, 2009.  This financial support enabled a number of WG 21 members to attend the 
Conference.  The meeting was attended by all the Chairs and Co-Chairs of the working groups and a 
numbers of members.  The working groups’ activities were shared.  This resulted in an invitation to WG 
21 to present the Non-indigenous Species database at the WGBOSV meeting in Hamburg, Germany in 
March 2010.  It was also agreed that the PICES and ICES Working Groups would meet again following 
the 7
th
 Marine Bioinvasions Conference to be held in Barcelona, Spain in 2011. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 3 
Taxonomy initiative  
 
The Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS), as part of the taxonomic initiative under the MNIS sub-project which is 
part of the project entitled “Development of the prevention systems for harmful organisms’ expansion in the 
Pacific Rim” is funded by a voluntary contribution to PICES from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan, through the Fisheries Agency of Japan.  The project is anticipated to run for 5 
years (from April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2012).  
 
Appendix 6  WG 21 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48   119 
In addition to the RAS conducted in Jeju, Korea, collector surveys were undertaken in China and Japan.  Dr. Li 
Zheng presented results from Qingdong and Qingdao, China.  Collectors were also put out by Canada and 
United States but analysis not yet complete.  
 
Two proposals (Tokyo Bay and Osaka Bay) for a demonstration RAS workshop were presented by Dr. Hiroshi 
Kawai.  WG-21 selected the Osaka Bay proposal based on the following criteria: cost, biodiversity, facilities 
and logistics.  The demonstration RAS workshop will be held in July 2010 with the precise date to be 
determined shortly.  IOC WESTPAC will be invited to participate and will conduct its own RAS later in the 
fall 2010. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 4 
Marine non-indigenous species database initiative 
 
The marine non-indigenous species database is the other MNIS sub-project funded by MAFF.  Ms. Deborah 
Reusser and Dr. Henry Lee II reported on the following upgrades to the database: 
a. Ability to add images, 
b. Ability to add pdf files, 
c. Ability to output maps to pdf or to a printer, 
d. Bulk import utility,  
e. Utility to produce spreadsheets of information by species. 
 
The latest version of the database was installed on Working Group members’ laptops at the meeting.  
Development of the database will be finished March 31, 2010.  WG 21 members agreed to submit data 
quarterly to Dr. Lee for wrap-up.  However, they were not able to resolve the question of a web-based 
application or long-term maintenance of the database. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 5 
Glossary of terms and definitions 
 
A draft of a glossary was completed by Mr. Graham Gillespie.  WG 21 members will review the glossary and 
add terms that are missing.  Mr. Gillespie will then sort and compare the entries and prepare a final version by 
October 2010.   
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 6 
Compilation of databases of NIS experts including taxonomists 
 
Dr. Blake Feist prepared a draft compilation of NIS experts.  WG 21 members will review the draft and  
Dr. Feist will produce a final version by January 2010 to be posted on the Working Group’s webpage. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 7 
Summary of marine bioinvasions in the North Pacific 
 
Dr. Lee reported on progress on the marine bioinvasions database.  Data entry is slower than planned. WG 21 
members agreed to supply data in a timely manner as discussed above.  They also agreed that an atlas of NIS 
species, with distribution maps and ecological characteristics, would be the best way to communicate a 
summary of marine bioinvasions in the North Pacific.  The atlas would be a PICES publication and brochure, 
with a CD, and pdf file posted on the PICES website.  The atlas will be completed October 2010 with 
publication in 2011.

Korean port environmental risk assessment technology  
 
Dr. Junghoon Kang presented Korea’s efforts to develop environmental risk assessment technologies for ports.  
This includes monitoring and risk assessment. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 9 
ICES Code of Practice on Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms  
 
Dr. Judith Pederson, Chair of ICES WGITMO, presented a summary of the ICES Code of Practice on 
Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms.  A number of ICES member countries, including Canada, 
use this code as a basis for their approvals of transfers of marine organisms in their aquaculture industries.  
This summary will be included in WG 21’s final report in 2012. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 10 
International Maritime Organization Ballast Water Standards 
 
Dr. Lee presented a summary of IMO Ballast Water Standards.  To date, no PICES member countries have 
ratified the IMO convention on ballast water.  Dr. Lee’s summary will be included in WG 21’s final report in 
2012. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 11 
Topic Session proposal 
 
WG 21 recommends a ½-day Topic Session on “Join the club:  Integrating non-indigenous species with other 
anthropogenic influences on coastal ecosystems” at PICES-2010 (WG 21 Endnote 3).  We believe that the 
PICES 2010 Annual Meeting in Portland is particularly well suited for this proposed topic session. First, since 
much of the research on the impacts of NIS on coastal marine systems occurs in North America, Portland 
would serve as a convenient hub for this special session. Second, The Center for Lakes and Reservoirs (CLR) 
at Portland State University (PSU) is an internationally renowned Center that focuses on NIS research and 
serves as a conduit for much of the NIS research that occurs on the West Coast of the United States. 
 
Proposed budget:  $3,500 to cover travel of 2 keynote speakers. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 12 
Recommendations to MEQ  
 
The Working Group recommends that the MEQ Committee approve: 
a. Holding a 4- to 5-day demonstration RAS workshop in Japan (MAFF funding), 
b. Holding a 4-day Rapid Assessment Survey in Oregon (MAFF funding), 
c. Holding a 2-day Working Group meeting at PICES-2010, 
d. Advising Science Board that WG 21 intends to publish an atlas of non-indigenous species in the North 
Pacific in 2010, 
e. Approving a ½-day Topic Session at PICES-2010 in Portland, Oregon, and travel support for 2 keynote 
speakers.

WG 21 Endnote 3 
Proposal for a ½-day Topic Session on  
“Join the club:  Integrating non-indigenous species with other anthropogenic influences on  
coastal ecosystems” at PICES-2010 
 
When people think of anthropogenic forcing in coastal marine ecosystems, commercial fishing, aquaculture, 
pollution and urbanization usually come to mind. Another type of anthropogenic forcing, typically not 
classified as such, is the presence of non-indigenous species (NIS). While the occurrence and subsequent 
impacts of NIS in coastal ecosystems are usually not classified as anthropogenic, the mechanisms of their 
introductions are, by definition, anthropogenic. 
 
The Advisory Panel on Anthropogenic Influences on Coastal Ecosystems (AICE-AP), under the auspices of 
FUTURE, identified NIS as an exemplary anthropogenic impact on coastal marine systems. Further, in order 
to begin addressing the three key questions identified as priorities for FUTURE research activities, AICE and 
COVE (Climate, Oceanographic Variability and Ecosystems) Advisory Panels made it a priority to either 
establish new PICES expert groups or to build on and extend existing activities in PICES. Working Group 21 
WG 21 Annual Reports  Appendix 6 
122  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
(Non-indigenous Aquatic Species) was one of the existing expert groups that was specifically suggested to 
“form an association with AICE”. Therefore, we propose a PICES Topic Session dedicated to NIS as an 
anthropogenic influence on coastal ecosystems, which would facilitate the priorities set forth by the 
aforementioned advisory panels 
 
If we wish to integrate NIS with other anthropogenic influences, we need a better understanding of ecosystem 
or regional impacts of NIS. Many, if not most, studies on the impacts of NIS in marine systems are done at 
small spatiotemporal scales, i.e., typically over small areas (1 m
2
) or under controlled circumstances with 
single species interactions. Conclusions from these studies are often scaled up and extrapolated to entire 
ecosystems or regions, but the extrapolations are limited by the fact that NIS consequences for whole 
ecosystems are not limited to single species interactions within homogeneous habitats. The dynamics of NIS 
impacts vary over space and time. Processes occurring over seasonal, annual and decadal time horizons 
interact in complex ways with habitat type, condition and availability, native species assemblages, trophic 
interactions, and food web dynamics. Understanding these complexities requires restructuring how we think 
about NIS invasions and their impacts on the health of coastal systems. Including and integrating NIS 
invasions with other anthropogenic influences would help advance our objective of getting a better 
understanding of the ecosystem and regional impacts of NIS introductions. 
 
Problems arising from the existence of NIS in coastal systems should be addressed using an ecosystem based 
approach. Continuing to study and manage NIS invasions as single species problems must be replaced by 
examining NIS within the context of the systems in which they invade. For example, global climate change is 
expected to have clear consequences with regard to future NIS introductions, establishment, and range 
expansion of currently established populations. Ignoring this complex interaction will only hinder efforts to 
control established populations and prevent new introductions. Integrating NIS invasions with existing 
anthropogenic stressors will facilitate a holistic approach to addressing the challenges facing our coastal 
marine ecosystems. 
 
Recommended Convenors: Blake Feist (USA) and Hiroshi Kawai (Japan)

Background 
 
The North Pacific marine environment has provided a diverse and valuable series of ecosystem services to 
coastal communities for many thousands of years. Ocean and land-based anthropogenic activities are now 
widely recognized to have a strong influence on ecological processes throughout the North Pacific marine 
ecosystem. Anthropogenic influences such as commercial fishing, aquaculture, pollution, and urbanization are 
particularly strong in coastal waters where they impose a wide variety of multiple stressors that can impact 
fundamental ecosystem functions, critical processes, and marine biodiversity. Changes in the physical and 
biological environment perturb native communities, often resulting in disruption of species interactions and 
trophic relationships that can negatively impact productivity and diminish ecosystem resilience. In addition, 
large scale processes such as regime shifts, ocean oscillations, and climate variability can alter near-shore 
processes. For example, introduced species can negatively impact native communities, and commercial 
shipping and recreational activities can be a powerful vector for changes in the geographic distribution of 
marine and estuarine species. Similarly, changing ocean conditions have facilitated the continued pole-ward 
range expansion of a number of marine organisms, often with unknown impacts on the ecosystems they are 
moving into. Recent range expansion (e.g., Humboldt squid) and population eruptions (e.g., jellyfish) on both 
sides of the Pacific have had negative consequences for native flora and fauna. 
 
Application of an ecosystem-based approach to coastal management would provide a template to better 
understand multiple stressors in coastal systems. Continuing to study and manage these stressors independently 
as single problems must be replaced by examining multiple stressors within the context of the ecosystems they 
are altering. Further, global climate change is expected to have clear consequences with respect to future 
species introductions, establishment, and range expansion. Ignoring complex interactions will only hinder 
management efforts. Thus, integrating non-indigenous species invasions with existing anthropogenic stressors 
will facilitate a holistic approach to addressing the challenges facing our coastal marine ecosystems. 
 
Summary of Presentations 
 
This session explored the characterization, understanding, and forecasting of the influence of multiple 
anthropogenic stressors in North Pacific coastal ecosystems. For example, how do non-indigenous species 
interact with other anthropogenic stressors?  The presentations dealt with a high-level overview of stressors in 
various North Pacific ecosystems (e.g., overharvesting, urbanization, habitat alteration and loss, mariculture, 
HABs, pollution, non-indigenous species, etc.) and the types of impacts that have been observed, especially 
those linked to changes in biodiversity and productivity (e.g., extinctions, species interactions, trophic 
cascades).

REPORT OF WORKING GROUP ON  
NON-INDIGENOUS AQUATIC SPECIES 
 
 
The Working Group on Non-indigenous Aquatic Species (hereafter WG 21) held its fifth meeting October 23–
24, 2010 under the co-chairmanship of Ms. Darlene Smith and Dr. Vasily Radashevsky who presented opening 
remarks and welcomed participants. All PICES member countries were present except China (WG 21 
Endnote 1).  On the first day, the agenda dealt with items 1 to 5, with the remainder being discussed on the 
second day. The agenda for the meeting can be found in WG 21 Endnote 2. 
 
 
October 23, 2010 
 
AGENDA ITEM 2 
Reports on WG 21 activities in 2010 
 
Demonstration Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS) workshop in Japan 
A demonstration RAS workshop on “An introduction to rapid assessment survey methodologies for 
application in developing countries” was held July 13–15, 2010 at the Marine Station of the Center for Inland 
Seas on Awaji Island, Japan.  The workshop was hosted by Professor Hiroshi Kawai of Kobe University (see 
PICES Press Vol. 19, No. 1, pp. 30–31).  The goal of the workshop was to provide outreach to participants 
from developing Southeast Asian countries through training in survey techniques that are quick and 
inexpensive and can be used where monitoring for non-indigenous species (NIS) is limited and not conducted 
in a systematic manner.  The RAS is a tool for small-scale surveys and is not a replacement for large-scale 
monitoring programs.  Participants came from Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand.  
They visited a number of sites around Osaka Bay where they were shown techniques to sample a variety of 
habitats. Specimens from the highly developed inner part of Osaka Bay and from the relatively pristine area 
outside of the Bay were collected and identified for comparisons.  Based on the positive feedback received 
from the workshop in Japan, Dr. Thomas Therriault and Prof. Kawai are considering conducting a larger 
demonstration workshop next year.  
 
RAS 2010 in Newport, Oregon, U.S.A. 
The third WG 21 RAS was held at the Hatfield Marine Science Centre in Newport, Oregon, October 18–20, 
2010.  Twenty participants from Canada, Japan, Russia and the United States sampled intertidal and shallow 
subtidal habitats in Coos Bay and Yaquina Bay.  Results of the Oregon RAS included identification of 191 
taxa, most identified to the species level.  Twenty-five species of polychaete represent the first records of these 
species in one or more of the sampled Oregon estuaries, and 8 species of polychaete represent new records in 
Oregon. 
 
A significant advantage of these surveys is the opportunity for taxonomists to examine material from different 
areas and exchange ideas directly with other taxonomists of the same taxa and with other invasion ecologists. 
The participation of ascidian taxonomists in this survey allowed the identification of the second Pacific record 
of the introduced North Atlantic sea grape Molgula citrina, which was also the first Pacific record south of 
Alaska. 
 
Two of the RAS participants, Graham Gillespie and Sylvia Behrens Yamada, contrasted Canadian and U.S. 
methods to trap European green crab Carcinus maenas, allowing a unique opportunity to inter-calibrate 
methods used among PICES member countries.  Sylvia Behrens Yamada and colleagues have conducted trap 
surveys in Washington and Oregon estuaries for over a decade while Graham Gillespie and colleagues have 
conducted trap surveys in British Columbia for the last 5 years. 
 
Gear types are standardized but the survey methodologies have subtle differences.  In Washington and Oregon 
surveys are completely intertidal with traps set from shore during low tides, while in British Columbia surveys 
Appendix 6  WG 21 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48   127 
include inter- and sub-tidal habitat with traps set by boat.  Catch rates (proxy for abundance) vary widely: 
generally less than 1 crab/trap-day in Washington and Oregon, while some sites in British Columbia have 
yielded over 30 crabs per trap-day.  Therefore, it was desirable to trap a common area using both methods for 
inter-calibration. 
 
Direct comparisons provisionally indicate that the two methods are comparable.  Shore-based trapping is the 
most efficient means in large coastal estuaries as green crab populations are limited to the upper intertidal.  The 
sample sizes were low and comparisons over a range of abundance would further increase confidence in these 
results.    
 
Collector plates were deployed during 2010 in Canada in the ports of Vancouver and Victoria, Canada, in an 
effort to compare with the Ruiz group in San Francisco, U.S.A. Collector plates were also deployed in Osaka 
Bay, Japan, and the ports of Pusan, Pohang and Daesan in Korea.  In the United States collectors were 
deployed in Oregon for the WG 21 RAS and in Seattle.   
 
Non-indigenous species database project  
Dr. Deborah Reusser installed the new version of the PICES NIS database on the laptop computers of 
participants at the meeting, and was able to resolve incompatibility issues resulting from different versions of 
Windows operating systems.  The database contains a new feature which permits mapping of indigenous and 
non-indigenous species at a global scale using MEOW ecoregions.  Another feature of the database is the 
ability to generate custom atlas reports. 
 
Non-indigenous species in the North Pacific atlas  
The draft atlas was presented to participants.  The atlas now contains 631 non-native species and will be placed 
on a password protected site for review by WG 21 members and taxonomists who have participated in the 
RAS.   
 
The long-term future of the database and atlas was also discussed.  Funding from the Japanese Ministry of 
Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (MAFF) used to develop the database ends March 12, 2012.  The United 
States Atlas Program has offered to host the database.  Given PICES’ limited resources for data management, 
this offer will be investigated as a long-term solution for the NIS database and atlas. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 3 
Country reports 
 
Canada  
Dr. Therriault reported that the Canadian Government has renewed funding for NIS.  Fisheries and Oceans 
Canada is reviewing its marine and freshwater monitoring programs.  The current Canadian Aquatic Invasive 
Species Research Network (CAISN) 5-year program will end March 31, 2011.  A new 5-year network 
focusing on early detection, rapid response, climate change and management advice will succeed it.  The new 
name is the NSERC Network on Aquatic Invasive Species and it will include an Arctic component, given the 
expectation that the Northwest Passage will be open to shipping in the relatively near future.  Information on 
CAISN can be found at www.caisn.ca.  The first record of the periwinkle Litorina litorea was reported in 
British Columbia. 
 
China 
No Chinese member was in attendance to provide a report. 
 
Japan  
Dr. Takeo Kurihara informed the meeting that Japan has begun a National Survey on the Natural Environment 
program.  Under this program, organisms will be monitored for 100 years.  The monitoring is focused on 
natural and well-preserved sites and will identify all organisms including NIS. Additional information on this 
survey can be found at:

Korea 
Dr. Jung-Hoon Kang gave a presentation on Port Environmental Risk Assessment Technology.  Korea is 
conducting biological and environmental monitoring in 11 shipping ports.  The biological monitoring includes 
NIS.  The NIS monitoring includes deployment of the WG 21 collector plates. NIS will be classified based on 
risk.  DNA probes are being developed to detect high-risk species.  Korea is considering adding the NIS data 
from their port surveys to the PICES NIS database. 
 
Russia 
Dr. Radashevsky reported that Dr. Alexander Zvyagintsev of the Institute of Marine Biology, Vladivostok, has 
created a group working on NIS which has studied organisms in ballast water from two ships, one from Japan 
and one from China.  A list of species found in the ballast water has been published.  Many of the species were 
NIS.  The publication is in Russian but has a list of the Latin names of species.  Surveys are being conducted 
around Vladivostok Harbour to detect NIS.   
 
United States of America 
Dr. Mark Sytsma reported on a West Coast governors’ agreement on ocean health. It is an ocean policy for the 
region with 7 elements, including one on NIS.  There are two tasks related to NIS: standardizing ballast water 
regulations (Pacific ballast water group) and eradication of four species of invasive Spartina.  The objective of 
the Spartina management plan is to eliminate it by 2018.  The three West Coast states and British Columbia 
are involved in implementing the management plan. 
   
Dr. Blake Feist reported that NOAA deployed collector plates at two stations around Seattle.  The plates were 
modified to be attached to fixed structures.  The plates have been collected and preserved, but not analysed.  
Additionally Dr. Andrew Cohen of NOAA has produced a paper on pathogens in ballast which can be 
accessed at the following URL:

Dr. Henry Lee II reported that the Environmental Protection Agency is developing national ballast water 
standards and that Gregory Ruiz (Smithsonian Environmental Research Center) and Dr. Ian Davidson 
(Portland State University) are continuing extensive monitoring of hull fouling on ships at ports on the west 
coast of North America. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 4 
Other updates 
 
RAS workshop in Thailand for the WESTPAC region  
Dr. Apple Chavanich of Chulalongkorn University organized a Rapid Assessment Survey with WESTPAC 
funding.  Dr. Therriault will share information and a proposal for a WG 21 event next year in Thailand. 
 
Activities with ICES 
Ms. Smith reported on the discussions by two ICES working groups (Working Group on Introduction and 
Transfer of Marine Organisms and the Working Group on Ballast and Other Ship Vectors) on possible 
collaboration between ICES and PICES.  The two ICES working groups discussed the PICES NIS database 
but consider it too complex for immediate use. However, they still wish to continue to explore opportunities 
for collaboration with WG 21.  A joint meeting between WG 21 and the ICES working groups is proposed 
concurrent with the 7
th
 Marine Bioinvasions Conference in Barcelona, Spain, in August 2011. 
Appendix 6  WG 21 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48   129 
Establishment of more formal linkages with NOWPAP  
Dr. Sangjin Lee (NOWPAP) provided an update on NOWPAP NIS activities and indicated an interest in 
establishing linkages with PICES WG 21.  NOWPAP is one of the UNEP Regional Seas Programs.  NOWPAP 
has 4 member states, China, Japan, Korea, and Russia.  One of Regional Activity Centres, DINRAC (Data and 
Information Network Regional Activity Centre), has established a database related to marine environment 
conservation on their website.   DINRAC has compiled national reports prepared by national experts from 
member states on NIS and combined into a regional report.  It includes current status, legislation, prevention, 
detection and management of MIS (marine invasive species), which is being implemented by each member 
state.  More information on NOWPAP can be found at the following website: http://www.nowpap.org  and

AGENDA ITEM 5 
Long-term NIS activities in PICES 
 
WG 21 is scheduled to complete its term at the PICES-2012 in Japan.  A discussion was held among the  
5 member countries present to assess interest in continuing work on NIS within PICES.  Representatives from 
Canada and the U.S. agreed that NIS will continue to be a priority for them.  Korean participants believe that 
NIS will continue to be a priority but that the focus of work should change and include climate change 
elements.  Japanese participants indicated that NIS will continue to be an important issue, but that the focus 
should change to include indigenous and non-indigenous species in the context of climate change. The Russian 
participant concurred that it was important to continue the NIS work.   
 
Discussions amongst WG 21 members during the meeting and at the PICES Opening Reception about this 
topic resulted in the following topics to be considered for continued PICES work on NIS: 
 Climate change is expected to alter both indigenous and NIS species.  Indigenous species may well change 
their ranges, especially in ecosystem boundary areas.  Climate change may result in new vectors or change 
in the relative importance of existing vectors that introduce NIS.  Climate change may also alter the 
severity of the impacts of NIS species and may result in indigenous species becoming problem species, as 
is the case with some species of jellyfish. 
 
WG 21 Annual Reports  Appendix 6 
130  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
 Future PICES work could include study of the impacts of climate change on indigenous and NIS.  The 
foundation work of WG 21, including the database and RAS/taxonomy initiatives, could be used to 
support this new focus.  There could also be an opportunity to incorporate the work of the Section on 
Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB-S), as harmful algae will be affected by climate change just the same as the 
macro-organisms that WG 21 has focused on. 
 
WG 21 members also discussed how current and future work must be relevant to the FUTURE program and its 
Advisory Panel on Anthropogenic Influences on Coastal Ecosystems (AP-AICE).  Members believe that a new 
focus on climate change would be consistent with FUTURE.

AGENDA ITEM 6 
WG 21 MAFF projects – Plans for 2011–12 
 
Database and atlas 
Discussion focused on the final entry of data.  Dr. Lee II offered to enter data if it is sent him in an ordered 
format.  WG 21 members and taxonomists who have worked on the RAS can submit data.  Korea will consider 
entering the data from their port survey project.  Deadline for comments on the database to Dr. Lee is due 
December 31, 2010.  Dr. Reusser noted increasing difficulties being encountered with different versions of 
Windows and operating languages, and is working to resolve this issue. 
 
Taxonomy project 
Plans for a WG 21 RAS prior to PICES-2011 in Khabarovsk, Russia, were discussed.  Khabarovsk is situated 
on the Amur River, some 700 km north of the Port of Vladivostok.  Vladivostok, with its Institute of Marine 
Biology, was selected as the best location for the WG 21 RAS. 
 
Continuation of collector plate surveys 
Dr. Therriault sent collectors out this year and offered to ship collector plates to WG 21 members for the 2011 
sampling year.   
  
Demonstration workshop for countries in economic transition  
The first RAS demonstration workshop was a successful start but a larger workshop is needed to reach more 
countries.  Dr. Therriault and Prof. Kawai will work with Dr. Chavanich to develop a proposal to hold a 
second demonstration workshop in Puket, Thailand, during the summer of 2011, with support from 
WESTPAC.  Target participants will be researchers and managers working on NIS.  
 
Report to Japanese Fisheries Agency  
A report of WG 21 and HAB activities conducted with the funding from MAFF will be presented to the 
Japanese Fisheries Agency.  The WG 21 portion will include a summary of the RAS and the database and atlas 
development.  The deadline for the report is October 31, 2010.  The report is for bureaucrats and should 
highlight the successes and important results of the projects, for example, the confirmation that Ulva pertusa, 
which has been washing up in abundance in Oregon, is native to Asia and the documentation of Mogula 
citrina, a solitary tunicate from the North Atlantic.  
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 7 
Terms of reference  
 
WG 21 reviewed its terms of reference and confirmed that it is on track for completion in October 2012.

Request for financial support  
The organizers of the 7
th
 International Conference on Marine Bioinvasions have requested financial support of 
$5000 from PICES.  PICES has previously provided financial support at this level to fund travel for 
participants from PICES member countries.  WG 21 members are supportive of this request.   
 
Potential linkages between WG 21 and FUTURE 
Dr. Therriault led the discussion on potential linkages between WG 21 and the FUTURE program, focusing on 
AP-AICE.  WG 21 activities are consistent with FUTURE but are scheduled to terminate October 2012, 
leaving a short time period to develop links.  A decision will be required to continue PICES work on NIS if 
longer-term links to FUTURE are to be established.   
 
Suggestions for linking NIS with HAB-S or rolling WG-21 over into a section were made.  A number of WG 
members indicated that their countries (Canada, Japan, Korea, U.S.) were interested in continuing with NIS.  
Climate change was proposed as a future focus of NIS activities.

The Working Group on Non-indigenous Aquatic Species (hereafter WG 21) held its sixth meeting October 14–
15, 2011 under the chairmanship of Ms. Darlene Smith who presented opening remarks and welcomed 
participants. WG 21 members from three PICES member countries (Canada, Japan and USA) and observers 
from the Northwest Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP) and the IOC Sub-Commission for the Western Pacific 
(WESTPAC) were present (WG 21 Endnote 1).  On the first day, the agenda dealt with items 1 to 4, with the 
remainder being discussed on the second day. The agenda for the meeting can be found in WG 21 Endnote 2. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 2 
Country and organization reports 
 
Canada 
The first Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network (CAISN), which was established in 2006, came to a 
close in 2011.  The focus of the network was to identify and quantify the vectors and pathways by which 
aquatic invasive species enter Canada, determine factors that affect their colonization success, and develop risk 
assessment models for potential and existing aquatic invasive species.  A report on CAISN is available at: 
http://www.caisn.ca/uploads/CAISN_FinalReport20112.pdf.  
 
The Canadian Government has renewed funding for CAISN to address remaining information gaps.  Future 
research will focus on four new core themes:  
 Early Detection,  
 Rapid Response,  
 AIS as Part of Multiple Stressors,   
 Reducing Uncertainty in Prediction and Management   
More information can be found online http://www.caisn.ca/en/index.php.  
 
Currently there are two research projects underway in the Pacific including: Characterizing effects of trophic 
interactions between native and non-native filter feeders on establishment and spread of aquatic invasive 
species, and  evaluation of the efficacy of trap out efforts to control invasive European green crab: Lessons 
from Pipestem Inlet, BC. 
 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada is also currently developing a national regulatory proposal to address the threat 
of aquatic invasive species. 
 
Japan 
A new species of non-colonial tunicate Ascidiella aspersa, first identified in Japan in 2009, has become 
widespread.  It is causing serious damage to various cultured species, especially scallops.  Work to confirm the 
validity of identification and origin of this species is ongoing.   
 
Future funding from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), which has funded 
two WG 21 initiatives, will now focus on how to use coastal ecosystems sustainably and will not be directed 
specifically to non-indigenous species.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is leading the North Pacific Landscape Conservation 
Cooperative (NPLCC), one of the many LCCs in a new national network aimed to address large-scale 
conservation issues like climate change and invasive NIS through a collaboration of natural resource agencies 
and universities.  The NPLCC includes estuarine and coastal waters from Northern California to southeast 
Alaska.  Although the NPLCC is still formulating its priorities and has not yet significantly addressed marine 
bioinvasions, it is anticipated that this will become a priority in the future. 
 
As part of the National Fish Habitat Action Plan, USFWS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) are helping lead the formation of a new Pacific Marine and Estuarine Fish Habitat 
Partnership that will encompass California, Oregon, and Washington coastal waters.  As with other fish habitat 
partnerships under this national program, this effort may be a source of additional resources for non-
indigenous species monitoring and control.  
 
The National Ocean Policy, established by Presidential Executive Order on July 19, 2010, includes nine 
National Priority Objectives that address pressing issues such as climate change and ocean acidification. A 
strategic action is being developed for each one of these objectives. (http://www.whitehouse.gov/ 
administration/eop/oceans).  Invasive species components are being incorporated into strategic action plans to:  
 identify and prevent high-risk introductions of non-native species;  
 increase research capacity to document economic and ecological impacts; and   
 establish interagency partnerships to bring together expertise, strengths and resources to control existing 
populations. 
 
NOAA has assisted in updating and revising the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) 
planning process to increase its benefit to preventing the spread of invasive species.  The revised HACCP 
planning process includes a stronger emphasis on risk assessment in order to identify high-risk activities and 
focus attention on actions needed to reduce the movement of potential invasive species.  NOAA will continue 
to offer HACCP training sessions to staff and grant recipients.  
 
There is increased interest in non-indigenous tunicates in the Northeast Pacific since Didemnum vexillum was 
discovered last year on the Oregon coast and in Sitka, Alaska. In both cases, consideration of eradication 
opportunities were clouded by uncertainty about species range and the limited success of previous control 
efforts of this species and other non-indigenous tunicates in Puget Sound.  There is also limited information 
available to help predict the ecological and economic implications of an invasive tunicate invasion in nearshore 
habitats. Citizen scientists were key to the discoveries in both Oregon and Alaska and continued to help with 
additional surveys in 2011 –  illustrating the value in engaging nonprofessional groups in early detection of 
marine non-indigenous species. 
 
The recent northward range expansion of Undaria pinnatifida into San Francisco Bay continues to raise 
concerns about its potential establishment in Oregon and Washington coastal waters.  Currently there is no 
substantial effort to regularly survey for this macroalgae in the Northwest, nor is there much information 
available to estimate its potential impacts or plan for rapid response opportunities.

Northwest Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP) 
Dr. Sangjin Lee provided an overview of NOWPAP activities related to aquatic invasive species.  A regional 
report entitled “Regional Overview and National Reports on the Marine Invasive Species of the NOWPAP 
Region” has been produced.  It contains information on current activities, threats and management, and 
information on current and ongoing research projects, and can be found at http://dinrac.nowpap.org. 
 
IOC Sub-Commission for the Western Pacific (WESTPAC) 
Dr. Suchanna Apple Chavanich gave an update on WESTPAC activities related to non-indigenous species 
conducted under the Project on Coastal Marine Biodiversity.  The objectives of this project are to understand 
and provide the scientific basis for biodiversity management, to establish an effective management plan and 
monitoring programs for marine biodiversity among WESTPAC member countries and to encourage research 
collaboration and exchange of knowledge among WESTPAC countries.   
 
Of note for 2011 was the IOC-WESTPAC/PICES joint workshop on “Rapid Assessment Survey Methodologies 
for Detecting Marine Non-Indigenous Species” held July 19–21.  The purpose of the workshop was to provide a 
contextual perspective on why monitoring for non-indigenous species is important; to educate participants in 
RAS methodologies and demonstrate their application; and to provide participants with an overview of the 
PICES WG 21 database and how all can benefit from such an application.  Twenty-nine participants from  
9 countries (Canada, China, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) attended.

Demonstration Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS) in Thailand 
As mentioned above, the second demonstration workshop was conducted July 19–21, 2011 in Puket, Thailand.  
Twenty-nine participants from 9 countries were provided with an overview of the rationale behind rapid 
assessments and the methods developed and used by WG 21.  Two intertidal field sites were visited to collect 
scrapings and collector plates.  A significant advantage of these methods is their low cost.  It was noted that 
tropical waters have a high percentage of unknown species and taxonomy issues.  Dr. Hiroshi Kawai (Kobe 
University, Japan) gave a presentation on molecular tools for species identification.  Participants indicated that 
they were very satisfied with the workshop and that they intended to initiate rapid assessment projects in their 
home countries. 
 
Seventh International Conference on Marine Bioinvasions 
The Seventh International Conference on Marine Bioinvasions was held August 23–25 in Barcelona, Spain.  
Dr. Thomas Therriault served on the conference Scientific Steering Committee, representing WG 21.   The 
theme of the conference was “Advances and gaps in understanding marine bioinvasions”.  PICES provided 
travel support to 8 graduate students and 4 postdoctoral fellows from PICES member countries to attend  
the conference.  Additional information on the conference can be found at 
http://www.pices.int/publications/pices_press/volume20/v20_n1/pp_32-33_MBIC.pdf. The Eighth Conference 
on Marine Bioinvasions is to be held in 2013 on Canada’s West Coast.  This location was chosen to increase 
participation from Western Pacific countries.  
 
RAS 2011 in Vostok Bay, Russia 
The fourth WG 21 RAS was conducted from October 7–14, 2011, at the Vostok Marine Station.  Most of the 
sampling was conducted in and around Vostok Bay in habitats that varied from small harbors to rocky shores 
and mud flats. Collector plates were deployed for 5 months. Two sets of these plates were recovered from 
Vostok Bay and one from the international harbor in Vladivostok.  Participants from all PICES member

Dr. Sangjin Lee provided an overview of NOWPAP activities related to aquatic invasive species.  NOWPAP 
has developed a Medium Interim Strategy 2012–2017 that comprises five areas of focus of which “biodiversity 
conservation” is of most relevance to WG 21.  The biodiversity conservation focus includes: 
 information sharing on current situation with biodiversity, including Marine Invasive Species (MIS) and  
 application of international regulations for the prevention of alien species invasions. 
 
NOWPAP has initiated a project to hold a regional workshop on “MIS problems in northwest Pacific region”.  
The funding is from the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research.  The workshop will be held 
October 23–24, 2012, in Qingdao, China.  Experts from China, Japan, Korea and Russia will participate.  The 
workshop objectives are to: 
 exchange information on MIS problems among officials and experts from NOWPAP member states;  
 exchange experiences on the prevention and control of MIS problems among officials and experts from 
NOWPAP member states; 
 analyze the needs for policies and measures on MIS problems and recommendations for NOWPAP 
member states. 
 
Specific topics to be discussed are:  
 the current situation of MIS problems in the NOWPAP region; 
 experiences and good practices on the prevention and control of MIS problems; 
 challenges in prevention and control of MIS problems; 
 needs for policies and measures on MIS problems in NOWPAP member states; and 
 necessity and ways of cooperation among NOWPAP member states for the prevention and control of MIS 
problems in NOWPAP region.

MAFF-funded projects – final update 
 
A final project report was submitted to the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF). 
 
A brochure on the PICES Non-indigenous Species Information System, the Atlas of Non-indigenous Marine 
and Estuarine Species in the North Pacific, and Rapid Assessment Survey Projects were also published. 
 
Atlas and database 
Dr. Deborah Reusser gave a demonstration of the PICES Non-indigenous Species Information System and the 
Atlas of Non-indigenous Marine and Estuarine Species in the North Pacific. The database and atlas have been 
finalized and are available online at the Coastal Biological Risk Analysis Tools (CBRAT) website: 
https://cbrat.nationalatlas.gov/PICES_NISIS_download.html. The database and atlas can be accessed as 
follows:

View the install instructions for the PICES_NISIS Database.  The database is a .zip file. Once downloaded, 
you will need to unzip it and then follow the install instructions for the appropriate operating system. View the 
Users Guide and Metadata for the PICES_NISIS Database. 
 
The Atlas of Non-indigenous Marine and Estuarine Species in the North Pacific 
This atlas provides summary information on the species in the PICES_NISIS Database along with statistical 
analyses for the North Pacific regions on the distributions of nonindigenous species at the ecoregion and 
regional scale for the six North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES) member countries. Articles will 
be prepared for PICES Press to publicize the database and atlas.  The metadata for the database and atlas will 
be entered into the TCODE information system. The data will be included in the Species at Risk to Multiple 
Climate Stressors (risk analysis tools) on the CBRAT website.  It is anticipated that experts will be able to add 
additional NIS records in 2013 and that general public access will be available in 2014. Canada noted that it 
benefited greatly from information in the PICES NIS database to develop responses to non-indigenous species 
that arrived on debris resulting from the March 11, 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.   
 
Taxonomy project 
The final Rapid Assessment Survey Demonstration Workshop was held February 8–9 at the Seikai National

Discussion and recommendations for future NIS activities in PICES 
 
Having completed its original mandate, WG 21 concluded that non-indigenous species (NIS) will continue to 
be an issue of significant concern for PICES members. Discussion considered various options for continuing 
work on NIS. Briefly, WG 21 recommends that PICES should utilize and build upon the NIS database and 
atlas tools to focus on how future global climate change and anthropogenic vectors will change the distribution 
of NIS in the North Pacific and to undertake risk identification to inform mitigation measures by PICES 
member countries. Revised terms of reference and further discussion of NIS activities can be found in WG 21

PICES Scientific Report No. 48   141 
Future of NIS activities within PICES 
 
While WG 21 has successfully completed its terms of reference, this does not mean that the problem of marine 
NIS has been solved in the North Pacific. The natural next step is to build upon the database and 
accomplishments of this Working Group and move forward in the area of marine NIS interactions with marine 
ecosystems. With the completion of the comprehensive database on marine NIS distributions in the North 
Pacific, the database can now be utilized in the next logical step of gaining predictive insight to the changes 
and impacts of NIS. Of particular interest is how projected global climate change (GCC) will affect the 
introduction, spread and impacts of NIS. GCC and the associated decrease in Arctic ice cover and opening of 
new shipping routes also poses questions related to the introduction and spread of NIS. Interest has also been 
expressed in addressing specific taxa of common interest to many PICES member countries (e.g., tunicates). 
Collaboration with other international organizations on NIS will be a benefit to PICES.  NOWPAP, 
WESTPAC and ICES are of particular importance in this regard. The option of simply moving forward with 
annual or biennial topic sessions was proposed but without a formal group structure this would be difficult to 
sustain. 
 
WG 21 developed the following options for continuing work on NIS within PICES: 
1. Creation of a Section on Marine Biological Pollutants Focused on NIS, 
2. Creation of a Working Group on NIS, 
3. Creation of an Advisory Panel on NIS,  
4. Amalgamation with S-HAB. 
 
Each alternative is discussed in greater detail below. 
 
1.  Creation of a new Section on Marine Pollutants  
 The NIS group could be the primary focus of biological pollution in North Pacific.   
 
2. Form a new Working Group on NIS with the following terms of reference: 
The following draft terms of reference were prepared by Dr. Blake Feist who has indicated he is willing to 
co-chair a new working group on NIS.  
1. Review and summarize the current knowledge of pelagic marine NIS spatio-temporal distributions in 
the North Pacific; 
2. Collaborate with physical oceanographers to better understand the role of ocean circulation patterns in 
marine NIS range expansion and how that range expansion may be affected by GCC (Direct link with 
S-HAB); 
3. Use publicly available geospatial databases and the WG 21 NIS database to explore the relationship 
between biodiversity, anthropogenic forcing and NIS, particularly in coastal ecosystems (potential 
collaboration with NOAA Fisheries); 
4. Generate peer reviewed manuscript describing relative risks imposed by selected pelagic marine NIS 
proliferation in the North Pacific and how they alter ecosystem services; 
5. Plan and coordinate a symposium, workshop or an annual meeting session on the marine NIS. 
 
What will set this new Working Group apart: 
 It will explicitly integrate with other working groups and sections (S-HAB, WG 28, WG 24, etc.). 
 It will produce peer reviewed papers as final products, which will better engage academics and provide 
focus for specific reference terms. This also reduces the risk of setting unobtainable goals. 
 It will explicitly incorporate ecosystem level (ecosystem services, food web dynamics, community 
structure, trophic ecology, etc.) priorities that are more useful to PICES member countries. 
 It will explicitly incorporate major forecasted shifts in ocean conditions (temperature, primary 
productivity, pH, hypoxia, upwelling, etc.) and how NIS may or may not respond differently from native 
species to these changes. 
  
WG 21 Annual Reports  Appendix 6 
142  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
3. Form a new Advisory Panel on NIS with the following terms of reference: 
1. Focus on exchange of information related to changes to diversity, distribution, impacts, issues, 
mitigation, regulation among PICES member countries and between other international organizations 
(e.g., NOWPAP, WESTPAC and ICES);  
2. Provide recommendations on PICES NIS activities including linkages with other relevant working 
groups and sections; 
3. Develop and implement proposals for workshops and theme sessions at future PICES meetings; 
4. Develop and implement data, information, and technical standards for NIS in the NP (e.g., monitoring 
tools, risk assessment procedures, mitigation or control options, etc.); 
5. Model after ICES approach for annual reports from countries including updates of data to the PICES 
NISIS database. 
 
4. Amalgamate with S-HAB 
While the S-HAB has indicated an interest on focusing on climate change in their draft terms of reference, the 
Section intends to remain focused on phytoplankton.  The NIS issue goes well beyond phytoplankton so if this 
was a desired direction, MEQ would need to clarify if a new Section would resemble the MAFF Project teams. 
 
Relevance of continued NIS activities to FUTURE 
 
WG 21 has developed tools that would allow FUTURE to use information on NIS as an index of a specific 
anthropogenic stressor. However, to implement this in the context of FUTURE (see below) it will be necessary 
to update this index as a time series for each ecoregion.  This index could be included in the next NPESR. 
Further, a continued NIS expert group would allow exploration of climate change models on the most probable 
changes in NIS distributions around the North Pacific and to identify likely changes in NIS vectors (e.g., new 
shipping routes, expanding trade, etc.). The last component this new expert group could address is how PICES 
member countries have been affected by NIS and what community responses have occurred due to NIS 
incursions in the North Pacific. 
 
FUTURE scientific priorities 
 
 The effects of climate and climate change on physical, geochemical and biological processes at 
geographical scales ranging from the North Pacific basin and its marginal seas to the coastal regions of 
interest to PICES member countries; 
 Direct and indirect effects of human activities, such as fishing, aquaculture, introduced species, habitat 
alteration, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions and their consequences for member countries. 
 
FUTURE research themes 
 
1. How might changing physical, chemical and biological processes cause alterations to ecosystem structure 
and function? 
2. What thresholds, buffers and amplifiers are associated with maintaining ecosystem resilience? 
3. How has the important physical, chemical and biological processes changed, how are they changing, and 
how might they change as a result of climate change and human activities? 
4. What factors might be mediating changes in the physical, chemical and biological processes? 
5. How are human uses of marine resources affected by changes in ecosystem structure and function? 
6. How do multiple anthropogenic stressors interact to alter the structure and function of the systems, and 
what are the cumulative effects? 
7. What will be the consequences of projected coastal ecosystem changes and what is the predictability and 
uncertainty of forecasted changes?

AGENDA ITEM 4 
NOWPAP Medium-Term Strategy 
 
The Northwest Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP) has adopted a Medium-Term Strategy for 2012–2017.  Under 
this Strategy NOWPAP activities will focus on five priority areas: 
1. Integrated coastal and river basin management; 
2. Regular assessments of the state of the marine environment; 
3. Pollution prevention and reduction, including harmful substances, hazardous waste and marine litter; 
4. Biodiversity conservation (including marine invasive species); and 
5. Climate change impacts. 
 
NOWPAP will publish an Atlas of Marine Invasive Species in 2014. 
 
Given the overlap of interests and membership, WG 21 members recognized the benefits of cooperation on 
marine non-indigenous species between PICES and NOWPAP. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 5 
Review of final WG 21 report 
 
A draft of the final report was reviewed and suggestions made for completion.   
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 6 
Discussion and recommendations for future NIS activities in PICES 
 
Having completed its original mandate, WG 21 concluded that non-indigenous species (NIS) will continue to 
be an issue of significant concern for PICES member countries. Discussion considered various options for 
continuing work on NIS. Briefly, WG 21 recommends two options for continuing NIS activities:  
1. Create a section focused entirely on marine non-indigenous species; or 
2. Create a Section on Conservation Focused on Drivers of Change in Biodiversity. 
Proposed terms of reference for the two recommended options can be found in WG 21 Endnote 3.  
 
WG 21 also recommends that PICES organize and support the following workshop/special sessions: 
 Support a joint PICES/ICES theme session on “The Increasing importance of biofouling for marine 
invasions: an ecosystem altering mechanism” at the 2014 ICES Annual Science Conference in Spain; 
Appendix 6  WG 21 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48   145 
 Mitigation and control measures to reduce the impacts of NIS on biodiversity; 
 Range expansion of indigenous and non-indigenous species vs. human-mediated introductions; 
 FAO workshop on identification of VMEs in the North Pacific Ocean;  
 NPFC SWG meetings on identification of VMEs and development of encounter protocols.

Recommendations for future PICES activities on NIS 
 
WG 21 makes the recommendations to Science Board on the following two options for continuing activities 
related to marine non-indigenous species: 
 
Option 1 – Create a section focused entirely on marine non-indigenous species 
 
Terms of reference 
 
1. Continue to share information and taxonomic expertise and update the database and atlas on new 
introductions to ecoregions; 
2. Evaluate how changes in patterns of trade affect pathways and vectors, and provide new species pools 
from donor regions (e.g., in the potential opening of a north polar sea route, it is possible that NIS could 
spread between the North Atlantic and North Pacific); 
3. Develop a protocol for sampling non-indigenous aquatic species in PICES member countries, including a 
method for sampling on polar sea route ships; 
4. Develop a better understanding of changing distributions of NIS and vectors in the context of global 
climate change and its impacts on temperature, salinity, ocean acidification and deoxygenation;  
WG 21 Annual Reports  Appendix 6 
146  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
5. Develop capacity for predicting changes in the distribution patterns of selected marine NIS among PICES 
member country ports over the next 100 years as global climate change leads to the opening of new 
pathways (e.g., shipping in the Arctic); 
6. Evaluate the risk of biofouling (hull fouling and tsunami debris) as a vector for the introduction of NIS.  
Additionally, evaluate the individual risks presented by species commonly encountered in biofouling 
vectors; 
7. Investigate why some species establish over broad areas while some only establish restricted distributions.  
Compare widely distributed species (e.g., green crab) with those of the same phyla with a narrow 
distribution. This information could be used in future risk assessments; 
8. Changing vectors (e.g., biofouling ships + tsunami debris (a novel vector) and understanding the risk of 
these species); 
9. Plan workshops/special sessions, for example: 
– Support a joint PICES/ICES Theme Session on “The increasing importance of biofouling for marine 
invasions: an ecosystem altering mechanism” at the 2014 ICES Annual Science Conference in Spain; 
– Propose a workshop/session on mitigation and control measures to reduce the impacts on NIS on the 
marine environment; 
– Propose a workshop session on the role of global climate change in species’ range expansion and 
human-mediated introductions. 
10. Work with NOWPAP and ICES to accomplish the terms of reference; 
11. Work with other PICES expert groups to accomplish the terms of reference; 
12. Prepare a final report on accomplishments. 
 
 
Option 2 – Create a Section on Conservation Focused on Drivers of Change in Biodiversity 
 
Terms of reference 
 
1. Partnerships: 
 Establish linkages with other intergovernmental organizations dealing with biodiversity issues (e.g., 
ICES, NOWPAP, WESTPAC, NPFC, CBD, FAO); 
 Document and predict patterns in biodiversity: 
– Identify potential mechanisms to store and share information/data on biodiversity issues in the 
North Pacific (and beyond), e.g., PICES atlas on NIS, NPFC SWG to build and update databases 
of the past and current distributions of key commercial and non-commercial species, including 
database of NIS, at the scale of ecoregions; 
– Identify areas that support high, rare, or unique biodiversity, including VMEs and EBSAs in 
collaboration with international organizations including CBD, FAO, NPFC, NOWPAP using 
international criteria (e.g., CBD criteria for EBSA identification; FAO criteria for VME 
identification). 
 
2. Understanding drivers of change in biodiversity: 
 Identify major drivers of change in biodiversity in the North Pacific Ocean, including non-indigenous 
marine species, climate change, fishing, and eutrophication, and develop pathways of effects models 
for related activities that describe the mechanisms of change, including interactions among multiple 
stressors; 
 Develop indicators to assess how drivers and biodiversity are changing over time and space (e.g., 
ecosystem status index); 
 Develop models that relate changes in environmental (e.g., climate-related changes in temperature, 
salinity, pH and O
2
, human (e.g., changes in the distribution of fishing effort, discharge of effluents), 
and ecological variables (e.g., change in community structure) to changes in species distribution 
patterns, including changes in NIS distributions; 
 Develop models and predictions of change in biodiversity under alternative scenarios of climate 
change, NIS introductions, fishing patterns, eutrophication, or other key threats;   
Appendix 6  WG 21 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48   147 
 Investigate impacts of NIS, fishing, climate change, contaminants (and other key threats) in areas that 
support high, rare, unique or endangered biodiversity; 
 Identify how human societies around the North Pacific value marine biodiversity and how they benefit 
from naturally diverse marine ecosystems. 
 
3. Provision of science advice: 
 Develop risk assessments for areas that support high, rare, unique or endangered biodiversity; 
 Review mechanisms to conserve biodiversity in the North Pacific, including development/ 
implementation of Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs), identification of 
Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs), Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), etc. and identify 
mechanisms to preserve endangered and threatened species in the North Pacific; 
 Respond to emerging issues related to biodiversity; 
 Prepare science advisory reports on key biodiversity issues; 
 Work with other PICES expert groups to accomplish the terms of reference. 
 
4. Prepare a final report on accomplishments.

Fifth International Conference on “Marine Bioinvasions” and a joint meeting of 
ICES, IOC, IMO and PICES working groups on invasive species 
 
by Graham Gillespie 
 
The 5
th
 International Conference on “Marine Bioinvasions” 
was held May 21–24, 2007, at the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
U.S.A., with more than 180 participants from 22 countries.  
The event was co-sponsored by the International Council 
for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), the North Pacific 
Marine Science Organization (PICES), the U.S. National 
Sea Grant Program and MIT Sea Grant College Program, 
with additional support from NOAA.  The purpose of the 
conference was to examine marine bioinvasion vectors, 
patterns, distribution, ecological and evolutionary 
consequences, economic impacts, biosecurity approaches, 
and natural and invasion impacts on biodiversity. 
 
Each day of the conference opened with an excellent 
plenary talk.  Dr. Jeb Byers, University of New Hampshire, 
spoke on “upstream” dispersal of invasive species in 
advective environments.  Dr. Janice Lawrence, University 
of New Brunswick, greatly expanded the awareness of the 
role of viruses in plankton dynamics.  Dr. James Carlton, 
Williams College, gave an eloquent and entertaining 
presentation on the challenges associated with assessing the 
impacts of marine bioinvasions on ecological diversity, and 
thus the evolution, structure and functioning of natural 
communities.  There were 22 topic sessions that ranged in 
subject matter from Patterns in Time and Space, Impacts 
(Ecological, Economic, Risk Assessment, Strategies and 
Management Options), to Shipping (Biofouling and Ballast 
Water), and Phenotypic Responses, Molecular Tools and 
Information Management. 
 
While there were many papers documenting progress on 
invasive species issues, e.g., models to identify potential 
invasive species, predict species dispersal and describe the 
possible range of introduced species, it was clear that there 
is yet much work to be done.  In particular, general 
understanding and quantification of ecological and 
economic impacts need further development, as does the 
use of risk assessment principles to determine species with 
high potential to invade, to prioritize and direct research, 
and to identify high-risk vectors to management agencies. 
 
The conference was followed by a joint meeting of the 
ICES Working Group on Introductions and Transfers of 
Marine Organisms (WGITMO), the ICES/IOC/IMO 
Working Group on Ballast and Other Shipping Vectors 
(WGBOSV), and PICES Working Group 21 on Non-
indigenous Aquatic Species.  It was convened by the 
Chairmen of the respective groups:  Judith Pederson (MIT 
Sea Grant College Program, U.S.A., WGITMO), Anders 
Jelmert (IMR, Norway, WGBOSV), Darlene Smith (DFO, 
Canada, WG 21) and Vasily Radashevsky (Russian 
Academy of Sciences, WG 21).  The participants briefly 
reviewed mandates and functions of each working group, 
then moved on to discuss issues of joint interest and how 
we might work together in the future. 
 
Potential activities were discussed for the new PICES 
project on “Development of the prevention systems for 
harmful organisms’ expansion in the Pacific Rim”, funded 
by the Government of Japan.  A general lack of taxonomic 
expertise was cited as a limiting factor in exchange of 
information between the member nations of both ICES and 
PICES.  Discussion focussed on a database that would 
bring together taxonomic information and a registry of 
taxonomic experts from PICES member countries, similar 
to DAISIE (Delivering Alien Invasive Species Inventories 
for Europe). 
 
 
Participants of a joint meeting of ICES, IOC (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission), IMO (International Maritime Organization), and PICES 
working groups on invasive species. 
PICES Press Articles  Appendix 7 
150  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
The participants discussed the development of an invasive 
species database similar to DAISIE or the Pacific Coast 
Estuarine Information System to collate information on 
alien invasive species (AIS) from PICES member 
countries.  The database would be similar to the U.S. 
NISBASE (Non-indigenous Species Database) and would 
contribute to the development of a global invasive species 
network.  Database formats will be developed and tested on 
bivalve molluscs and reviewed at PICES XVI. 
 
The group also discussed the importance of ballast water 
and biofouling as potential vectors for the introduction of 
invasive species.  WGBOSV has nearly completed their 
ballast water sampling guidelines, and these will be 
distributed.  The group proposed the presentation of 
member country reviews of ballast water issues and 
discussion of critical issues related to ballast water for a 
joint ICES/PICES meeting during PICES XVI.  Several 
other topics included hull fouling and its role in introducing 
new species, identifying what is being done to prevent hull 
fouling, examining the ornamental fish trade as a potential 
source of introductions, and documenting the socio-
economic impacts of non-indigenous species. 
 
The final item of discussion was the role of ICES and 
PICES in advancing Early Detection and Rapid Response 
(EDRR) by governments, agencies and organizations to 
implement eradication or control measures for AIS.  The 
group suggested documenting impacts, costs, successes and 
failures from world-wide examples, with the intent of 
providing evidence that success is possible, and examining 
the roles of governments and citizens in EDRR.

PICES WG 21 Meets in Busan, Korea:  The Database Meeting 
 
by Thomas Therriault 
 
Non-indigenous species are a global concern because they 
are detrimental to native biodiversity and compromise 
ecosystem function.  To better understand non-indigenous 
species in the North Pacific (and beyond), PICES 
established a Working Group (WG 21) on Non-indigenous 
Aquatic Species that had its inaugural meeting at PICES 
XV in October 2006, in Yokohama, Japan.  In April 2007, 
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) 
of Japan, through the Fisheries Research Agency (FRA) of 
Japan, provided a voluntary contribution to PICES for a 
project entitled “Development of the prevention systems for 
harmful organisms’ expansion in the Pacific Rim”.  This 
project is anticipated to run for five years (from April 1, 
2007 to March 31, 2012), and has two distinct components:  
one on harmful algal blooms (HABs) and the other on 
marine non-indigenous species (MNIS).  The intent of the 
funding is to develop international systems to collect, 
exchange and store relevant data, and to foster partnerships 
with non-PICES member countries and related inter-
national organizations, such as the International Council for 
the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).  The contribution is 
from the Official Development Assistance (ODA) fund and 
thus, involvement of developing Pacific Rim countries is 
required in activities under this project.  The project is 
conducted by two PICES expert groups under the Marine 
Environmental Quality Committee:  Section on Ecology of 
Harmful Algal Blooms in the North Pacific (HAB Section) 
and WG 21.  Each group oversees a specific sub-project.  
Within the non-indigenous species envelope, two specific 
initiatives have been identified.  The first is the develop-
ment of a comprehensive MNIS database, with Dr. Henry 
Lee II (U.S. Environment and Protection Agency) serving 
as the Principal Investigator.  The second is a taxonomy 
initiative that includes rapid assessment surveys and 
associated collector surveys in PICES member countries, 
with Dr. Thomas Therriault (Fisheries and Oceans Canada) 
serving as the Principal Investigator. 
 
Working Group 21, under the co-chairmanship of Ms. 
Darlene Smith (Canada) and Vasily Radashevsky (Russia) 
have focused recent efforts on the database initiative.  
Following initial discussions held at a joint meeting of 
PICES WG 21, ICES Working Group on Introductions and 
Transfers of Marine Organisms and ICES/IOC/IMO 
Working Group on Ballast Waters and Other Ship Vectors 
(May 25–26, 2007, in Cambridge, U.S.A., in conjunction 
with the 5
th
 Conference on “Marine Bioinvasions”), a 
prototype MNIS database was developed by Dr. Henry Lee 
and Ms. Deborah Reusser based on the U.S. Environment 
and Protection Agency and the U.S. Geological Survey 
“Pacific Coast Ecosystem Information System” (PCEIS) 
spatial database.  At a meeting of WG 21 convened during 
PICES XVI (October 26–27, 2007, in Victoria, Canada), it 
became evident that a subsequent meeting was required to 
beta-test the MNIS database and to develop standardized 
protocols.  Dr. Yoon Lee (National Fisheries Research and 
Development Institute (NFRDI), Korea) graciously 
volunteered to host an inter-sessional meeting from March 
3–5, 2008, at his institute in Busan.  The purpose of the 
meeting was to reach an agreement on standards, data 
elements and data entry templates for the MNIS database 
that will be used to capture information on non-native 
species and allow sharing of this information, not only 
among PICES member countries, but more broadly with 
any community studying non-indigenous species.  Species 
continue to be transported with increasing frequency to

new environments around the world, primarily via 
activities associated with international trade and commerce 
(e.g., ballast waters, hull fouling, aquaculture, etc.), and 
once there, some impact ecosystem productivity and 
function, including local fisheries.  Thus, it is critical to 
understand the distributions of these species in newly-
invaded environments as well as in their native environ-
ments.  This information is essential for undertaking risk 
assessments and will be a valuable tool to identify, and 
potentially mitigate, a variety of vectors and pathways. 
 
Day 1 of the Busan meeting started with a round of 
introductions and opening remarks from our hosts.  After 
reviewing the agenda and expected outcomes from this 
inter-sessional meeting, the participants quickly immersed 
themselves in the world of database structure and function.  
One of the initial discussions was on what scale the 
database should be developed and subsequently populated.  
Existing data on non-native species in PICES member 
countries has been collected at various scales; whereas 
some studies included latitude/longitude information for 
each non-indigenous species, others have focused at much 
larger spatial scales (e.g., embayments or basins).  It was 
decided that for our purpose of understanding non-
indigenous species patterns in the North Pacific, it would 
be most informative if we worked at a fairly large spatial 
scale (although the database will allow input at much 
smaller spatial scales, thereby meeting the needs of all 
member countries while ensuring seamless merging of 
country databases for joint, large-scale analyses).  After a 
quick review of existing papers on potential spatial scales 
for the database, we agreed to use the eco-regions 
identified in a recent paper by Spalding et al. (2007; 
Bioscience 57: 573–582) that defined Marine Eco-regions 
of the World.  The key benefit of this paper for marine non-
indigenous species is that the eco-regions are defined for 
the globe and, given that any species has the potential to be 
moved anywhere around the globe, researchers can clearly 
identify the eco-regions to which the species is native and 
those for which it has invaded.  Further, this will allow our 
MNIS database to be populated by other groups working 
on characterizing and documenting the distribution of 
marine non-indigenous species (e.g., by ICES WGs). 
 
Other issues discussed on the first day of the meeting 
centered on classification standards.  When working on 
non-indigenous species, one needs to know that the species 
is not native to the ecosystem (eco-regions) where it has 
been identified.  Several classification criteria were 
determined, including documentation within the database, 
in order to be able to classify a species as native or non-
native.  However, the participants did recognize that an 
increasing body of literature exists for a number of taxa, 
especially some of the more controversial ones, which 
suggests that for some species, we simply will not be able 
to resolve their invasion status, and these will need to be 
treated as cryptogenic (unknown origin).  We also 
discussed how to identify if non-indigenous species have 
become established (self-sustaining population) compared 
to those that have not and represent “failed” introductions.

Barabanshchikov (Russia) on an impromptu taxonomic survey at a Busan 
market. 
 
Day 2 provided participants with some “alone time” with 
the database.  After exploring the database by conducting 
hands-on data entry using our favorite non-indigenous 
species, we had a series of discussions on the pros and cons 
of including life history information for these species and 
on the level of detail that could be incorporated into the 
database.  We also debated about who the end-users of the 
database likely would be and what their goals would be 
(e.g., conducting risk assessments).  By this point in the 
beta-testing it was very clear that with enough resources 
one could build the ultimate database that would include 
every potential bit of information a researcher could think 
of.  However, it also became apparent that someone would 
need to serve as the gatekeeper for this database, and that 
databases do not simply remain error-free all by 
themselves.  Thus, it was decided that, to the extent 
possible, we would include life history information into the 
database and that adequate documentation would need to 
be provided to implement this task.  This is consistent with 
the necessity to add a citation for each species record in the 
database, thereby providing a mechanism to link an 
occurrence with a source for this information.  After a visit 
to a local restaurant for lunch and a short stop at a local fish 
market, the group returned to NFRDI to continue their data 
entry quests.  As expected, there were a number of minor 
issues identified and corrected with respect to the database 
itself, but considerable progress was made and the group 
was very satisfied with the beta-version.  The key 
outstanding issue at the end of Day 2 was how to merge the 
individual country databases into a common database, or if 
the databases would be linked.

PICES Scientific Report No. 48   153 
Day 3 allowed the group to refocus on the outstanding 
issues that had been identified during the previous two days 
of database beta-testing, discussions, and problem solving.  
Representatives from each country had an opportunity to 
provide input on their expectations of the final version of 
the database that WG 21 expects to have fully operational 
(if not fully populated) in time for the rapid assessment 
surveys to be conducted at two locations in China, prior to 
PICES XVII in Dalian.  With an identified path forward 
that all attendees were comfortable with, including specific 
interim deliverables and associated timelines, the field trip 
portion of the meeting began.  First, it was a boat tour of 
the port of Busan, arranged by Dr. Yoon Lee in conjunction 
with the local port authority.  The group then proceeded on 
to Busan New Port which is currently under development 
and will greatly increase the shipping traffic in this part of 
the world once the expansion is complete.  The day ended 
with the last group dinner associated with this inter-
sessional meeting that allowed the participants to continue 
developing research collaborations and a better 
understanding of how non-indigenous species are impact-
ting various PICES member countries. 
 
Our meeting was a tremendous success thanks to Dr. Lee 
and his staff.  Not only were meeting facilities extremely 
comfortable, the group meals every evening allowed 
participants to mingle in a less formal setting.  In addition, 
we were able to sample a number of local delicacies (food 
and drink) and take in some of the sights this region has to 
offer.  WG 21 continues to make significant advances 
towards better understanding non-indigenous marine 
species in the North Pacific and the dedication of its  
 
members will ensure that we are successful in all our 
endeavors, including completion of the database we beta-
tested at our recent meeting in Busan.

PICES WG 21 Rapid Assessment Surveys 
 
by Thomas Therriault and Graham Gillespie 
 
Since its inception in 2006, PICES’ Working Group on Non-
indigenous Aquatic Species (WG 21) has been advancing 
our understanding of marine non-indigenous species in the 
North Pacific Ocean.  In 2007, the Japanese Government 
(Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan, 
through the Fisheries Agency of Japan) provided a 
voluntary contribution to PICES for a 5-year (2007–2012) 
project entitled “Development of the prevention systems for 
harmful organisms’ expansion in the Pacific Rim” to 
develop international systems to collect, exchange and 
store relevant data, and to foster partnerships with non-
PICES countries and international organizations.  The 
project has two distinct components, one on harmful algal 
blooms carried out by the PICES Section on Ecology of 
Harmful Algal Blooms in the North Pacific, and the other 
on marine non-indigenous species conducted by WG 21.  
Two specific initiatives have been identified within the 
latter component.  The first initiative is the development of 
a comprehensive database for non-indigenous species with 
Dr. Henry Lee II (U.S. Environment and Protection Agency, 
Lee.Henry@epa.gov) serving as the principal investigator.  
The second is a taxonomy initiative led by Dr. Thomas 
Therriault (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Pacific Biological 
Station, Thomas.Therriault@dfo-mpo.gc.ca).  The taxonomy 
initiative will focus on rapid assessment surveys for native 
and non-native species in a variety of habitats in commercial 
ports of PICES member countries, and on a collector survey 
to characterize the distribution of fouling organisms at a 
number of locations in each PICES member country.  The 
rapid assessment survey will be discussed in this article, 
but look for future PICES Press articles on the much 
anticipated collector survey to be conducted in 2009! 
 
In an ideal world, scientists would have the resources to 
maintain a vigilant watch for the arrival of non-indigenous 
species.  However, the reality is that no country has the 
resources, financial or personnel, to do this.  Thus, a rapid 
assessment survey (RAS) is one means to identify native, 
non-native and cryptogenic species present at a specific 
location at a specific time.  By conducting RAS over time, 
an important baseline is developed which allows researchers 
to identify the arrival of new species.  For the PICES 
project, we have elected to survey commercial ports in 
PICES member countries, as ports have a greater 
probability of containing non-indigenous species.  Not only 
do these locations serve as a recipient environment for 
organisms transported by commercial shipping (ballast 
water, ballast sediment, hull fouling), they also often have 
high levels of secondary traffic (recreational or small craft, 
aquaculture transfers) and tend to be more disturbed than 
natural environments, a factor that could enhance invasion 
success.  Although it may not be possible to characterize all 
habitat types within a port, our survey focuses on major 
ecosystem components, namely intertidal and subtidal 
habitats.  Intertidal habitats are sampled using both a timed 
walk and quadrat/grab sampling methods, and subtidal 
habitats are sampled using (tunicate) collectors, trapping 
for macrofauna (primarily fish and crabs) and a survey of 
the fouling communities on floating docks and their 
associated structure.  The intent of this qualitative survey 
(not a quantitative one) is to capture the species composition 
within each location surveyed, not characterize the 
abundance of any specific species.  Population estimates can 
be made in subsequent surveys, if needed, but are not the 
principle reason for conducting a RAS.  The assignment of 
native, non-native or cryptogenic status occurs following 
species identification based on literature accounts, general 
rules for classification of status, and discussion by WG 21 
members. 
 
Although many invertebrate species (not all) would be in 
greater abundances during the warmer, summer months, we 
decided it would be more informative for participants if 
sampling were carried out in conjunction with PICES 
Annual Meetings.  Since many of the RAS participants also 
attend these meetings, logistical and economic benefits are 
also realized.  Thus, our RAS will be conducted in the host 
PICES member country the week prior to the Annual 
Meeting (generally mid-October), as was the case with our 
first RAS in China.  It is possible that some taxonomic 
groups might not be encountered or species missed, but this 
is expected and represents one limitation of these types of 
surveys.  If the intent was to fully characterize a location, 
then sampling should be repeated during other seasons, but 
this significantly increases the resources needed and the 
number/type of species added is relatively minor. 
 
The goal and success of this type of survey requires the 
participation of taxonomic experts with broad knowledge 
of their taxonomic group, in addition to the participation of 
taxonomic generalists who are able to help with sampling 
and species identification (primarily via the use of 
identification keys).  Also, this type of survey can provide 
some training to taxonomic generalists, but more 
importantly can serve as a forum where taxonomic experts 
can discuss the organisms encountered.  For example, 
experts with extensive knowledge from the North 
American side of the Pacific can discuss species found in 
Asian RAS with taxonomic experts familiar with these 
species there.  It also provides an opportunity to highlight 
and potentially resolve taxonomic issues that can arise 
among countries, given differences in language and 
taxonomic advancements since the development of 
identification keys.  For example, some taxa recently have 
been re-described based on either traditional morphological 
techniques or more modern genetic ones.  Our RAS forum 
provides an opportunity for taxonomists to discuss these 
changes and/or advances.  Given logistical constraints of

The 2008 PICES Rapid Assessment Survey team. 
 
these types of surveys, our RAS uses members of WG 21 
and as many taxonomic experts from the host country as 
possible.  Participation of students is encouraged for 
logistical support and training.  For some taxonomic groups 
experts might not exist in the host country, and so these 
“key” taxonomic experts are sought to participate.  If you 
are a taxonomic expert wishing to be involved in our 
planned RAS in Korea in 2009, please feel free to contact 
Dr. Therriault about potential participation. 
 
Taxonomy for some species will be controversial, and 
reference collections are important to document the 
occurrence of non-indigenous species, thus it is imperative 
that voucher specimens be maintained for future reference.  
Within our project, the host PICES member country is 
maintaining organisms encountered during the RAS in 
suitable archives.  Further, all species records will be entered 
into the PICES WG 21 Non-indigenous Species Database. 
 
PICES WG 21’s first RAS was conducted in October 2008 
in China, with two commercial ports targeted, Dalian on 
the Yellow Sea and Bayu Quan on the Bohai Sea.  One 
unforeseen obstacle to sampling international ports was 
security concerns raised by port authorities.  Thus, the port 
sampling was graciously co-ordinated by our Chinese hosts 
under the supervision of Dr. Lijun Wang from the National 
Marine Environmental Monitoring Center of the State 
Oceanic Administration (SOA).  A total of 18 samples 
were collected according to the RAS sampling guidelines 
and preserved for identification by our international team 
of taxonomic experts.  In addition to ourselves and Dr. 
Wang, this team consisted of Darlene Smith (National 
Headquarters, Fisheries and Oceans Canada), Zhisong Cui 
and Li Zheng (First Institute of Oceanography, SOA, 
China), Hiroshi Kawai (University of Kobe, Japan), Vasily 
Radashevsky, Eduard Titlyanov and Tamara Titlyanova 
(Institute of Marine Biology, FEB RAS, Russia), Liudmila 
Budnikova (Pacific Research Institute of Fisheries and 
Oceanography, Russia), Blake Feist (Northwest Fisheries 
Science Center, NMFS, U.S.A.) and Judith Pederson (MIT 
Sea Grant Program, U.S.A.). Further, Dr. Wang also 
provided our RAS team with laboratory space, equipment, 
and reference materials, at the brand new National Marine 
Environmental Monitoring Center facilities in Dalian, and 
his hospitality ensured the RAS team was happy and 
productive during our visit to China.  
 
Preliminary results of the Dalian RAS include algae (45 
taxa), arthropods and molluscs (25 taxa each), polychaetes 
(6 taxa), fish (5 taxa), bryozoans, cnidarians, echinoderms, 
platyhelminths and poriferans (2 taxa each) and one taxon 
each of hydrozoan, nemertine and tunicate.  Most taxa were 
identified to the species level, although many are 
provisional identifications.  Some taxa could only be 
identified to the genus, family or order levels until further 
investigation.  However, we were able to classify three 
species as non-indigenous: shells were collected from the 
bivalve molluscs Argopecten irradians, Mizuhopecten 
yessoensis and Mactra chinensis.  The former two species 
are actively cultured in China, and the latter is readily 
PICES Press Articles  Appendix 7 
156  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
available in local markets.  As only shells were collected, 
we cannot be certain whether these species have established 
viable populations in Dalian.  It is possible that other non-
indigenous species were encountered in some of the other 
taxonomic groups, notably algae, amphipods, and 
polychaetes, but identifications and classifications are 
pending.  As our surveys continue, generating distributional 
data for a number of taxa among PICES member countries, 
it will be possible to better understand the extent of non-
indigenous marine species in coastal waters of the North 
Pacific Ocean.

2009 International Conference on “Marine Bioinvasions” 
 
by Thomas Therriault 
 
From August 24–27, 2009, about 200 bioinvasion biologists 
from around the globe descended on Portland, Oregon, U.S.A., 
to exchange ideas and information at the 6
th
 International 
Conference on “Marine Bioinvasions”.  An additional meeting 
between PICES Working Group on Non-indigenous Marine 
Species and two ICES Working Groups on Ballast Waters 
and Other Ship Vectors and on Introductions and Transfers 
of Marine Organisms held immediately following this 
conference on August 28, allowed continued discussions 
about the role and impact of non-indigenous species world-
wide, and how these two major regional scientific 
organizations could work together on this important topic. 
 
The conference Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) was 
composed of:  Jeb Byers (University of Georgia, U.S.A.), 
Jeff Crooks (Tijuana River National Estuarine Research 
Reserve, U.S.A.), Lisa Drake (Naval Research Laboratory, 
U.S.A.), Anders Jelmert (Institute of Marine Research, 
Norway), Yoon Lee (National Fisheries Research and 
Development Institute (NFRDI, Busan, Korea), Whitman 
Miller (Smithsonian Institution, U.S.A.), Henn Ojaveer 
(Estonian Marine Institute, Estonia), Gil Rilov (Oregon 
State University and University of Haifa, U.S.A./Israel), 
Mark Sytsma (Portland State University, U.S.A.), Thomas 
Therriault (Department Fisheries and Oceans, Canada), and 
Chela Zabin (Smithsonian Institution and University of 
California-Davis, U.S.A.).  In addition, the SSC benefited 
from input of two advisors: Jim Carlton (Williams College, 
U.S.A.) and Judith Pederson (Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology Sea Grant College Program, U.S.A.). 
 
 
The 6
th
 International Conference on “Marine Bioinvasions” was held in Portland:  downtown Portland across the Willamette River (left) and the Portland 
Classical Chinese Garden – place for the conference Welcome Reception (right).  Located near the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers, 
Portland has been referred to as the most environmentally friendly or “green” city in the United States, and the second most in the world.  In October 
2010, Portland will host the 2010 PICES Annual Meeting. 
 
The conference was hosted by the Portland State University, 
with Mark Sytsma leading the local organizers.  Sponsors 
for the conference were: the North Pacific Marine Science 
Organization (PICES), the International Council for the 
Exploration of the Sea (ICES), the Pacific States Marine 
Fisheries Commission (PSMFC), the Aquatic Bioinvasions 
Research and Policy Institute at the Portland State University, 
the U.S. National Sea Grant College Program, and the U.S. 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 
 
ICES and PICES supported the three invited plenary 
speakers at this year’s conference.  These were: Dr. Anna 
Occhipinti-Ambrogi (University of Pavia, Italy), who 
spoke on alien species as an aspect of global change; 
Professor Sergej Olenin (Unifob AKSIS, Bergen, Norway 
and Coastal Research and Planning Institute, Klaipeda 
University, Lithuania), who summarized patterns and impacts 
of marine bioinvasions in Europe; and Professor Yoon Lee 
(NFRDI, Korea), who reviewed marine bioinvasions in Asia. 
The conference agenda was an energetic one with two 
concurrent oral sessions on each of the four days (a total of 
127 talks) and a poster session (24 presentations) required 
to accommodate the increased number of contributed 
papers over previous meetings.  The number of increased 
contributions reflects increased research activities on non-
indigenous marine species around the globe.  The conference 
featured a nice mix of topics, with species–specific 
sessions focused on lionfish, spartina, and European green 
crab, vector/pathway specific sessions (Propagule Pressure, 
and Measuring and/or Predicting Spread), sessions on 
applied approaches to non-indigenous species (Detection, 
Identification, and Tracking-to-Origin [including Advances 
in Detection], Predicting the Scale Diversity of Invasions, 
and Management, Rapid Response, Education, and 
Restoration), and sessions that provided insights to broader 
patterns and implications of non-indigenous species 
(Changing Global Conditions and Bioinvasions, Ecology 
and Evolution, and Invasion Patterns over Time and Space). 
PICES Press Articles  Appendix 7 
158  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
In addition to these theme sessions, this year’s conference 
hosted four workshops.  The Green Crab Management 
Workshop benefited from input from green crab 
researchers from around the world to help consider options 
for management of this high profile invader.  Similarly, the 
participants at the Invasive Tunicate Workshop provided 
input to Washington State’s Action Plan to address 
invasive tunicates in Puget Sound.  Workshops on 
Spartina/Seaweeds and Shipping Activities brought 
together conference participants working in these fields to 
formulate larger-scale research initiatives that can be 
conducted in future years.  The addition of workshops to 
the program of the conference was valued by participants. 
 
 
The Poster Session in front of the Hoffman Hall, Portland State University. 
 
With such a full academic agenda it is important to have a 
balanced social agenda as well.  Conference participants 
had many opportunities for informal discussions with 
colleagues and new friends.  As with previous conferences 
on “Marine Bioinvasions”, participants were provided 
breakfast and lunch on site, which allowed more discussion 
and less travel to seek restaurants off-site.  Portland is a very 
easy town to get around with free public transportation in 
the downtown core that allows wider access to shopping, 
restaurants, and microbreweries.  But the real highlight of 
the conference was the social evening hosted at the Chinese 
Gardens in the Chinatown District of downtown Portland.  
These gardens show what can happen when a small group 
of individuals come together to convert a vacant urban lot 
to a tranquil and relaxing environment.  Participants were 
even more relaxed when they found out that snacks and 
drinks were included! 
 
The conferences on “Marine Bioinvasions” have always 
been a place to showcase emerging research in this fast-
paced field.  Thus, conference organizers and sponsors 
encourage presentations by early career scientists.  This year 
was no exception.  Thanks to contributions from the co-
sponsoring organizations, it was possible to provide travel 
support to all of the graduate students and postdoctoral 
fellows who requested it.  PICES supported the travel of six 
graduate students (Heidi Gartner, Stephanie Green, Veronica 
Lo, Lisa Needles, Kimberly Peyton, and Cascade Sorte) and 
four post-docs (April Blakeslee, Jennifer Dijkstra, Anya 
Epelbaum, and Joshua Mackie) from Canada and U.S.A. 
 
As a PICES representative on the conference SSC, I would 
like to express my thanks to the PICES Secretariat for their 
professional assistance on the conference planning stage, 
and especially to Julia Yazvenko (PICES Database and 
Web Administrator) for her valuable help on site. 
 
Planning has already started on the 7
th
 International Marine 
Bioinvasions Conference, so feel free to contact any of the 
Scientific Steering Committee members, especially your 
PICES representatives, and watch for further details in 
future issues of PICES Press.

2009 PICES Rapid Assessment Survey 
 
by Graham Gillespie and Thomas Therriault 
 
PICES Working Group on Non-indigenous Aquatic Species 
(WG 21) has been working to increase our understanding 
of marine non-indigenous species (MNIS) in the North 
Pacific since 2006.  The taxonomy initiative is one of two 
key MNIS research activities within a 5-year (2007–2012) 
PICES project on “Development of the prevention systems 
for harmful organisms’ expansion in the Pacific Rim” 
supported by a voluntary contribution from the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan, through the 
Fisheries Agency of Japan.  Under the supervision of  
Dr. Thomas Therriault (Fisheries and Oceans Canada), this 
initiative has evolved to include both rapid assessment 
surveys and collector surveys.  The first PICES Rapid 
Assessment Survey (RAS) was carried out in October 
2008, in conjunction with the PICES Annual Meeting in 
Dalian, China.  This article discusses the second RAS 
conducted in October 2009, immediately prior to the 
PICES Annual Meeting in Jeju, Korea.  The 2009 RAS was 
a tremendous success thanks to excellent logistical support 
and local knowledge supplied by our hosts, Drs. Kyoung 
Soon Shin and Jung-Hoon Kang (Korea Ocean Research 
and Development Institute, Geoje). 
 
A rapid assessment survey provides the opportunity to 
catalogue native, non-indigenous and cryptogenic species 
at a given place and time.  Repeated surveys over time 
generate important baseline information that allows 
researchers to, among other things, determine when new 
species arrive.  Our surveys target commercial ports in 
PICES member countries, as ports have a greater 
probability of containing non-indigenous species.  Not only 
do these locations serve as a recipient environment for 
organisms transported by commercial shipping (ballast 
water, ballast sediment, hull fouling), they often have high 
levels of secondary traffic (recreational or small craft, 
aquaculture transfers) and tend to be more disturbed than 
natural environments, a factor that could enhance invasion 
success.  The PICES surveys focus on two major port 
ecosystem components, namely intertidal and subtidal 
habitats.  Intertidal habitats are sampled using both a timed 
walk and quadrat/grab sampling methods, and subtidal 
habitats are sampled using fouling organism collectors, 
trapping for macrofauna (primarily fish and crabs) and a 
survey of the fouling communities on floating docks and 
their associated structures.  These surveys are qualitative 
rather than quantitative and endeavour to capture species 
composition within each location surveyed, not characterize 
abundance of any specific species.  Classification of species 
as native, non-native or cryptogenic occurs following 
species identification based on literature accounts, general 
rules for classification of status, and discussion by 
members of the RAS team.

Discussion of the 2009 PICES Rapid Assessment Survey results at the WG 21 meeting, October 23, 2009, Jeju, Korea. 
 
In addition to the authors of this article, the 2009 PICES 
RAS team consisted of Darlene Smith (National Headquarters, 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada); Masaya Katoh (Seikai 
National Fisheries Research Institute, Japan), Hisashi 
Yokoyama (National Research Institute of Aquaculture, 
Japan); Jin-Woo Choi, Jung-Hoon Kang, Kyoong-Soon 
Shin, Seungshic Yum (Korea Ocean Research and 
Development Institute, Korea); Sae-Heung Kim, Jong-Rak 
Lee and Eun-Young Yim (Jeju Biodiversity Research 
Institute, Korea); Eduard Titlyanov and Tamara Titlyanova 
(Institute of Marine Biology of RAS, Russia); Suchana 
Apple Chavanich (Chulalongkorn University, Thailand); 
John Chapman (Oregon State University, U.S.A.) and Judith 
Pederson (MIT Sea Grant Program, U.S.A.).  Laboratory 
space, equipment, and reference material were graciously 
provided by the Jeju Biodiversity Research Institute (Jeju 
Hi-Tech Industry Development Institute, Seogwipo, Jeju, 
Korea). 
 
During the summer of 2009, three collector plates were 
deployed at different locations within each of the following 
four ports: Busan, Masan, Jangmok, and Ulsan.  These 
locations represented different levels of shipping and 
human-use activity that might suggest different patterns in 
non-indigenous species occurrence.  The collector plates 
were subsequently processed in Jeju, the week prior to the 
Appendix 7  PICES Press Articles 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48   161 
PICES Annual Meeting, by the assembled international team 
of participants.  Further, since one of the goals of these 
surveys is to act as a conduit of knowledge, Korean RAS 
team members participated in hands-on field sampling in 
Jeju at Seogwipo Port and Sunrise Peak, Sungsan 
(UNESCO’s World Nature Heritage Site).  Seogwipo Port 
was typical of a multi-use commercial area, with sampling 
conducted in and around the port using a chartered fishing 
vessel.  In addition, three baited traps were deployed at this 
location to sample more mobile fauna.  The Sungsan 
location was selected to demonstrate sampling at an 
intertidal beach where a number of bivalve and algal species 
were found.  Preliminary results of the 2009 RAS include 
213 taxa from the following groups: crustaceans (58 taxa), 
algae (55 taxa), molluscs (54 taxa), polychaetes (37 taxa), 
ascidians (9 taxa), bryozoans (7 taxa), cnidarians and 
echinoderms (4 taxa each), porifera (3 taxa) and one taxon 
each of platyhelminth and fish.  Most taxa were identified to 
the species level, although many are provisional 
identifications and will require further investigation.  Also, 
some taxa could only be identified to higher taxonomic levels 
(genus, family or order).  Currently, we are able to classify 
four species as non-indigenous: the bivalve mollusc 
Mytilus galloprovincialis, the cirriped Balanus eburnus, the 
amphipod Podocerus cristata and the polychaete 
Hydroides norvegica.  A further 17 species were classified 
either as cryptogenic or status uncertain so it is possible 
that other non-indigenous species were encountered, but 
identifications and classifications are pending. 
 
The 2008 RAS in Dalian, China, identified a total of 119 
taxa, three of which (all bivalve molluscs) were classified as 
non-indigenous (PICES Press Vol. 17, No. 1, pp. 30–32).  
The larger species list in 2009 may be a reflection of the 
taxonomic expertise available for the Korean RAS or may be 
due to higher diversity at examined intertidal sites.  Because 
several identifications remain provisional, both the total 
number of species and the number of non-indigenous species 
may increase for both the Chinese and Korean surveys. 
 
As future surveys continue to gather distributional data for a 
number of taxa among PICES member countries, it will be 
possible to better understand the extent of non-indigenous 
marine species in coastal waters of the North Pacific Ocean.

PICES 2010 Rapid Assessment Survey 
 
by Graham Gillespie, John Chapman and Thomas Therriault 
 
Status and trends of non-indigenous species (NIS) are of 
enormous interest in the North Pacific, but establishing 
extensive international cooperation required to investigate 
the problem has been difficult.  In 2006, PICES Working 
Group 21 on Non-indigenous Aquatic Species was formed to 
increase understanding of marine non-indigenous species in 
the North Pacific.  In 2007, two initiatives were started in a 
5-year PICES project on “Development of the prevention 
systems for harmful organisms’ expansion in the Pacific 
Rim” supported by a voluntary contribution from the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) of 
Japan.  The first initiative, led by Dr. Henry Lee II (U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency) was to develop a 
comprehensive database for non-indigenous species.  The 
second was a taxonomy initiative that included rapid 
assessment and collector surveys in PICES member countries.  
Dr. Thomas Therriault (Fisheries and Oceans Canada) has 
served as the principal investigator of this initiative and 
organized rapid assessment surveys in 2008 in Dalian,  
 
China (see PICES Press 17(1): 30–32) and in 2009 in Jeju, 
Korea (see PICES Press 18(1): 38–40).  The third rapid 
assessment survey was conducted in Oregon, U.S.A., just 
prior to the 2010 PICES Annual Meeting in Portland. 
 
PICES Rapid Assessment Surveys (RAS) serve to collect 
initial baseline data and inter-calibrate species collection 
and identification methods that allow distinction of native, 
non-indigenous, and cryptogenic species.  Standardized RAS 
data permit comparisons of invasions within and among 
countries and can reveal mechanisms and consequences of 
invasions.  PICES RAS also support international cooperation 
that is critical for resolving NIS, their origins, mechanisms 
of dispersal, effects and impacts. 
 
International ports are particularly important recipients of 
organisms associated with ballast water, ballast sediment or 
hull fouling, and often have high levels of secondary traffic 
(recreational or small craft, aquaculture transfers) to adjacent

ports.  International ports also tend to be more disturbed 
than other less urbanized estuaries and bays, possibly 
enhancing invasion success.  New invasions, transoceanic 
transport mechanisms and vector pathways of dispersal are 
more readily identified and managed when they can be 
tracked among major ports.  Before PICES-2010, intertidal 
and shallow subtidal habitats of two Oregon estuaries 
(Coos Bay and Yaquina Bay) were sampled using fouling 
plates (collectors), traps for macrofauna (primarily fish and 
crabs), scrapings of floats and pilings, and by diver 
collections.  Additionally, a seawater reservoir tank at the 
Hatfield Marine Science Center in Yaquina Bay was drained 
and sampled for fouling organisms.  These qualitative 
surveys measured species diversity within each location.  
Classification of species as native, non-native or cryptogenic 
occurred following species identification based on 
literature accounts and analyses by RAS team members. 
 
The 2010 investigative team consisted of the authors of this 
article, Toshio Furota (Toho University, Japan), Gayle Hansen 
(Environmental Protection Agency, U.S.A.), Takeaki 
Hanyuda (Kobe University Research Center for Inland 
Seas, Japan), Leslie Harris (Natural History Museum of 
Los Angeles County, U.S.A.), Gyo Itani (Kochi University, 
Japan), Charles and Gretchen Lambert (University of 
Washington, Friday Harbor, U.S.A.), John Markham (Arch 
Cape Marine Laboratory, U.S.A.), Vasily Radashevsky 
(A.V. Zhirmunsky Institute of Marine Biology, Russia) and 
Sylvia Yamada (Oregon State University, Corvallis, 
U.S.A.).  Volunteer divers and laboratory assistants 
included Donnelle and Ralph Breitenstein, Jack Chapman, 
Ian Chun, Faith Cole, Lorne Curran, Carolyn Emch-Wei, 
John Estabrook, Jeff Fischer, Brian Fodness, Bruce 
Hansen, Vallorie Hodges, Katie Marko, and Darlene Smith.  
Laboratory space, equipment, and reference material were 
graciously provided by the Hatfield Marine Science Center, 
Oregon State University, Newport, U.S.A.  Additional 
funding and/or support was provided by Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada, Oregon Sea Grant, University of Guelph, 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Ralph and 
Donnelle Breitenstein and Liu Xin (Oregon Oyster, Inc.). 
 
On October 18, the team worked through samples provided 
to the Hatfield Science Center laboratory and was treated to 
a welcome reception at the Rogue Brewery in Newport.  
The reception featured microbrews and food provided by 
Oregon Oyster, Inc.  Investigators and volunteers participated 
in a day-long field trip on October 19 that included 
collections from public and commercial boat docks in 
Charleston Harbor and the City of Coos Bay.  Surface 
collections were supplemented with dive collections from 
low intertidal and subtidal zones and collection plates from 
Yaquina Bay.  The team completed sample processing on 
October 20 and was then invited to a wrap-up social at the 
home of Henry Lee and Debbie Reusser. 
 
Participants in the survey also contributed to presentations 
given at the WG 21 meeting and the Topic Session on 
“Anthropogenic forcing in North Pacific coastal ecosystems:  
Understanding changes in ecosystem structure and 
function” convened at PICES-2010.  These talks and posters 
helped to facilitate cooperation and exchange between 
experts from PICES member countries.  Topics included 
the WG 21 atlas of non-indigenous species in the North 
Pacific (Henry Lee II and Debbie Reusser); invasions, 
island biogeography and human welfare (John Chapman); 
propagule pressure in Didemnum vexillum (John Chapman 
et al.); Didemnum in New Zealand and other tunicate news 
(Gretchen and Charles Lambert); Hediste genetics (Toshio 
Furota and Hiroaki Toshuji); Orthione griffensis in Japan 
(Gyo Itani, Yukari Miyoshi and Hiroshi Kume); molecular 
elucidation of introduced seaweeds (Takeaki Hanyuda and 
Hiroshi Kawai); family Spionidae (Vasily Radashevsky); 
what makes better taxonomy (Leslie Harris); and green 
crab assessment in Yaquina Bay (Sylvia Yamada, Graham 
Gillespie and Katie Marko).

and Sylvia Yamada display non-indigenous European green crabs 
captured in Yaquina Bay. 
 
Preliminary results of the Oregon RAS included 191 taxa 
from 400 sample lots.  Nearly all taxa were identified to the 
species level, although many are provisional identifications 
and work is ongoing to resolve these.  Twenty-five species 
of polychaete represent first records of these species in one 
or more of the sampled Oregon estuaries, and eight species 
of polychaete represent new records in Oregon.  It is 
possible that other non-indigenous species were 
encountered but identifications and classifications are 
pending.  In collaboration with the Barcode of Life Project, 
many incomplete identifications will be explored further 
using molecular methods. 
 
A significant advantage of these surveys is the opportunity 
for taxonomists to examine material from different areas 
and exchange ideas directly with other taxonomists of the  
same taxa and with other invasion ecologists.  The 
participation of ascidian taxonomists in our survey allowed 
the identification of the second Pacific record of the 
introduced North Atlantic sea grape Molgula citrina, which 
was also the first Pacific record south of Alaska.  Another 
PICES Press Articles  Appendix 7 
164  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
advantage is the comparison of collecting techniques and 
the development of standards.  During this survey, 
Canadian and U.S. methods to trap European green crab 
Carcinus maenas were contrasted, allowing a unique 
opportunity to inter-calibrate methods used among PICES 
member countries.  Other special projects examined the 
distribution of the invasive tunicate Didemnum vexillum in 
Coos and Yaquina Bays and the Umpqua triangle, genetic 
samples of the algae Ulva and the nereid worm Hediste to 
determine possible Asian or North American origins, and 
infection rates of bopyrid isopod parasites in the Eastern 
and Western North Pacific. 
 
The 2008 rapid assessment survey in Dalian (China) 
identified a total of 119 taxa, three of which (all bivalve 
molluscs) were classified as non-indigenous.  The 2009 
survey in Jeju (Korea) identified 213 taxa with four (one 
bivalve mollusc, one cirriped, one amphipod and one 
polychaete) designated as non-indigenous.  The Oregon 
survey yielded at least 14 species that were classified as 
non-indigenous: four algae, six ascidians, three polychaetes 
and one crustacean.  Many identifications remain provisional; 
therefore, the total number of species and number of non-
indigenous species may increase for all surveys. 
 
Introductions reduce the wealth of every nation, and no 
country can deal with introductions alone.  The PICES 
surveys provide critical information and a mechanism to 
foster the international cooperation needed for each nation 
to detect and manage its introduced species.

PICES Workshop on “An Introduction to Rapid Assessment Survey Methodologies for 
Application in Developing Countries” 
 
by Thomas Therriault 
 
Since its inception in 2006, PICES Working Group 21 
(http://www.pices.int/members/working_groups/wg21.aspx) 
has been advancing our understanding of marine non-
indigenous species in the northern Pacific Ocean.  Rapid 
Assessment Surveys (RAS) are one approach to quickly 
characterize the native, non-native, and cryptogenic species 
present in different locations.  These qualitative surveys 
allow rapid depiction of the species composition within 
each location surveyed, not the abundance of any specific 
species.  Quantitative surveys to estimate population sizes 
could be done subsequently, if needed, but are too time 
consuming for rapid assessments.  Although specific 
methods vary slightly based on habitats being sampled or 
taxonomic groups being characterized, WG 21 has developed 
methodologies that have been used within PICES member 
countries to identify non-indigenous species in both inter-
tidal and sub-tidal habitats.  To date, RAS have been 
conducted in Dalian (China) in 2008, Jeju (Korea) in 2009, 
and most recently near Newport (Oregon, U.S.A.) in 2010 
(see related PICES Press article in this issue).  Data from 
each of these surveys have been archived in the PICES WG 
21 database of marine and estuarine species.  However, 
given the global nature of biological invasions, it is critical 
to engage researchers working on this important topic 
outside of PICES’ six member countries, especially in 
locations adjacent to the PICES region where the potential 
transport of non-indigenous species is expected to be high.  
PICES WG 21 is working with other international 
organizations to share information on global invaders, but 
there remain fundamental gaps within developing 
countries.  Thus, a demonstration workshop on “An 
introduction to rapid assessment survey methodologies for 
application in developing countries” was held to provide 
participants from developing countries with the tools to 
conduct their own surveys.  In addition, the workshop 
provided a clear context to why this type of activity is 
essential both locally and globally, and how information on 
non-native species can be shared between developing and 
PICES member countries to benefit all.  PICES co-
sponsored this workshop with the Fisheries Research 
Agency (FRA) of Japan and Kobe University’s Research 
Center for Inland Seas.  The workshop was co-convened by 
Drs. Hiroshi Kawai (Kobe University, Japan), Hisashi 
Yokoyama (National Research Institute of Aquaculture, 
FRA) and Dr. Thomas Therriault (Fisheries and Oceans 
Canada), and focused on hands-on training of researchers 
from mostly developing Southeast Asian countries 
concerned about the potential introduction of non-
indigenous marine species.  From July 13–15, 2010, 
participants from Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, 
Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Japan were invited 
to the Marine Station of Kobe University’s Center for Inland 
Seas (Awaji Island, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan) to learn about 
PICES activities on non-indigenous marine species and to 
receive training in Rapid Assessment Survey techniques.

RAS workshop participants at the Kobe University Marine Station sorting 
and identifying material collected from surveys on Awaji Island, Japan. 
 
The workshop exposed participants to (1) a background 
about marine non-indigenous species and why vigilance is 
required, using a series of short lectures, (2) hands-on 
experience in making field collections in a variety of 
coastal environments, and (3) laboratory experience using 
keys and reference material to identify the organisms 
collected.  Since the workshop focused on background and 
techniques, actual taxonomic experts were not utilized in 
this demonstration, but would play a critical role in actual 
RAS.  Taxonomic experts have a broad knowledge of their 
taxonomic group amassed over time spent studying 
thousands of individuals from different geographical areas 
to resolve identifications – skills taxonomic generalists 
must develop to confidently resolve identifications (and 
potential invasion status).  Further, given that taxonomy for 
some species will be controversial and that reference 
collections are important to document the occurrence of 
non-indigenous species, it is imperative that voucher 
specimens be maintained for future reference. 
 
Workshop participants visited a number of sites around 
Osaka Bay where they were shown techniques to sample a  
variety of different habitats.  On the first day, we visited a 
site on Awaji Island where participants made timed walk 
collections in two different inter-tidal habitats, one exposed 
directly to Osaka Bay with no development, and the other a 
small enclosed basin with shoreline development and small 
boat anchorages.  These inter-tidal collections were 
supplemented with snorkelling collections made in the 
shallow sub-tidal environment directly adjacent to the shore, 
providing excellent specimens of crabs, bivalves, and 
tunicates.  Loaded with bags of samples, participants 
returned to the Marine Station where they spent the 
afternoon identifying the treasures they had collected.  On 
the second day, we focused on the application of collector 
plates to monitor for the introduction (and/or spread) of 
fouling organisms like algae, tunicates, and bryozoans that 
have received much attention in the invasion literature 
lately.  Dr. Kawai and his colleagues have utilized these 
collectors to monitor changes in algae and invertebrate 
species in different parts of Osaka Bay over the past few 
years.  Participants were able to observe first-hand 
differences in fouling communities between a study site in 
the inner part of Osaka Bay (highly developed) and another 
near the Marine Station on the outer part of the Bay 
(relatively pristine).  Again, samples were collected and 
returned to the laboratory for further processing.  As 
thunderstorms pounded the Marine Station on the third day, 
participants were introduced to the PICES WG 21 database 
on marine and estuarine species developed by Dr. Henry 
Lee II and Ms. Debbie Reusser.  This hierarchical database, 
built on marine eco-regions of the world, can allow 
researchers from developing countries to archive their data 
in a systematic way that is then directly available both to 
them and to PICES member countries. 
 
The positive feedback from workshop participants was 
overwhelming, with many participants eager to initiate 
aspects of RAS within their home countries.  In fact, the 
feedback on this type of outreach and training activity was 
so encouraging that Drs. Therriault and Kawai are working 
with Dr. Apple Chavanich to host a larger demonstration 
workshop in 2011 in Bangkok, Thailand.

2011 PICES Rapid Assessment Survey 
 
by Vasily Radashevsky, John Chapman, Leslie Harris and Thomas Therriault 
 
The central question to be answered by the PICES Working 
Group 21 (WG 21), since its formation in 2006, has been 
whether increasing invasions of non-indigenous species 
(NIS) threaten marine resources of North Pacific countries.  
In accordance with its mission to increase understanding of 
marine NIS in the PICES area, WG 21 began work in 2007 
on the NIS component of a 5-year project on “Development 
of the prevention systems for harmful organisms’ expansion 
in the Pacific Rim” supported by a voluntary contribution 
from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of 
Japan, through the Fisheries Agency of Japan.  This NIS 
component was further divided into two initiatives.   
Dr. Henry Lee II (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; 
lee.henry@epa.gov) leads the first initiative, to develop a 
comprehensive database for non-indigenous North Pacific 
species.  The second initiative, to conduct rapid assessment 
surveys (RAS) of PICES member countries, is being 
coordinated by Dr. Thomas Therriault (Fisheries and Oceans 
Canada; thomas.therriault@dfo-mpo.gc.ca).  Both of these 
integrated initiatives have revealed: (1) significant and 
increasing threats to marine resources by NIS and (2) the 
critical importance of expanded international cooperation 
to resolve and manage them. 
 
Responses to invasions are unlikely to be initiated or to be 
effective without understanding the problems they cause or 
collaborative efforts to manage them.  Rapid assessment 
surveys are able to provide baseline data critical for measuring 
and limiting the rates and expansions of invasions among 
PICES member countries and are also indispensable for 
international calibration and standardization of both  
 
taxonomy and NIS detection.  International ballast water 
traffic has been an especially important mechanism for 
transporting organisms into countries where high levels of 
secondary traffic (small craft and aquaculture) transfer these 
organisms to adjacent areas.  The PICES surveys have been 
particularly useful for detecting and measuring invasions 
by all mechanisms. 
 
The first PICES RAS was organized in Dalian, China, in 
2008 (see PICES Press 17(1): 30–32).  The second survey 
was conducted on Jeju Island, Korea, in 2009 (PICES Press 
18(1): 38–40).  The third one took place near Newport in 
central Oregon, U.S.A., in 2010 (PICES Press 19(1): 27–
29).  The 2011 survey described in this article was 
organized just prior to the 2011 PICES Annual Meeting in 
Khabarovsk, Russia. 
 
The 2011 RAS was conducted in Peter the Great Bay, near 
Vladivostok and Nakhodka, the largest Far Eastern Region 
seaports of Russia.  The survey was based at the Vostok 
Marine Biological Station of the A.V. Zhirmunsky Institute 
of Marine Biology (IMB) of the Far Eastern Branch of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences, which is located about 2 
hours away in Vladivostok (see photo below).  The Vostok 
Station, on the coast of Vostok Bay (an eastern extension 
of Peter the Great Bay), was established by the IMB in a 
comparatively clean area with diverse surrounding habitats 
to serve as an international base for marine studies.  The 
biodiversity in the area has since become relatively well 
described due to continuous studies by scientists from all 
over the world.

picture: Olga Golovan, Anastasia Mayorova and Leslie Harris). 
 
As the previous year’s RAS in Newport was particularly 
successful for polychaetes, small crustaceans, and marine 
algae, it was decided to focus on these groups again in 
2011.  A 7-member group, Leslie Harris (NHMLAC, 
U.S.A.), Vasily Radashevsky, Inna Alalykina and Marina 
Nekrasova (IMB), Alexander Rzhavsky (Severtsov Institute 
of Ecology and Evolution, RAS, Russia), Jin-Woo Choi 
(South Sea Research Institute, KORDI, Korea), and Hisashi 
Yokoyama (National Research Institute of Aquaculture, 
Japan), dealt with polychaetes.  Another 7-member group, 
Liudmila Budnikova and, Evgeny Barabanshchikov and Ilia 
Korneichuk (TINRO-Center, Russia), John Chapman (Oregon 
State University, U.S.A.), Natalia Demchenko and Olga 
Golovan (IMB), and Xinzheng Li (Institute of Oceanology, 
CAS, China), surveyed crustaceans.  Three participants, 
Oksana Belous (PIBOC, Russia), Gayle Hansen (Oregon 
State University, U.S.A.) and Takeaki Hanyuda (Kobe 
University Research Center for Inland Seas, Japan), 
worked with algae.  Anastasia Mayorova (IMB) sampled 
for Sipunculida, and Evgeny Barabanshchikov did double 
duty, also surveying plankton.  Alexey Gorodkov and Ivan 
Kashin (IMB) set the collector plates, and Darlene Smith 
(Fisheries and Oceans Canada) served as data manager.  
The entire survey was coordinated by Vasily Radashevsky. 
 
The official survey took place from October 7–14.  Several 
participants (Alalykina, Chapman, Demchenko, Hansen, 
Harris, Radashevsky and Rzhavsky) stayed on for another 
two weeks to maximize sampling efforts around the Vostok 
Station and to examine collections in Vladivostok.  A 
seminar, with 10 reports on NIS research in the North 
Pacific, was organized at the station on October 13.  Two 
additional lectures on introduced species issues were also 
delivered by Harris and Chapman at the Institute of Marine 
Biology in Vladivostok. 
 
Most of the sampling was conducted in and around Vostok 
Bay in habitats that varied from small harbors to rocky 
points (see photo on next page) and mud flats.  Collector 
plates (man-made attachment sites for species that prefer 
hard substrates) were deployed for about 5 months.  Two 
sets of these plates were recovered from Vostok Bay harbors 
and one from the international harbor in Vladivostok. 
 
The value of the PICES surveys depends on whether 
biological invasions affect marine ecosystems or human 
welfare, and whether managing or preventing these 
invasions can be cost effective.  The surveys therefore 
focused on three relevant questions: 
Appendix 7  PICES Press Articles 
PICES Scientific Report No. 48   169 
 
Participants of the PICES Rapid Assessment Survey on the rocky shore of 
Anna Bight, Anna Lighthouse Resort Point, near Vostok Bay, October 9, 
2011. 
 
(1) What are the patterns, magnitudes and processes of 
biological invasions? 
(2) Can these invasions reduce food security, economic 
development or alter the ecological dynamics of natural 
ecosystems? 
(3) Can biological invasions be managed or prevented? 
 
All PICES member countries appear to be addressing 
Question 3 but are hindered by the absence of quantitative 
measures or rigorous theory for measuring effects or 
designing and testing responses.  International efforts depend 
on close collaborations such as those that the PICES 
surveys have produced.  The accumulating discoveries of 
the PICES surveys have addressed Questions 1 and 2 in 
particular, and thus Question 3 as well.  A sampling of 
PICES discoveries follows. 
 
The most fundamental parameters of invasion ecology, the 
origins of species (native, N or introduced, I) and their 
relative abundances (R = I/N) have proven elusive to 
measure in nearly all marine systems due to the large 
proportions of “cryptogenic species” (C), that cannot be 
confidently classified as I or N.  The unmeasured 
dependence of I and N on C has prevented confident 
measures of R.  Correlations between cryptogenic species 
with introductions but not with native species among sites 
and phyla were discovered in the PICES surveys.  The 
majority of cryptogenic species are likely to be introduced 
and therefore, can be included among introduced species 
for estimates of R.  Preliminary analyses of other surveys 
around the world indicate a nearly universal association of 
cryptogenic species with introductions. 
 
Another fundamental question has been whether the 
recently found invasions are due predominantly to rapidly 
increasing new mechanisms or to long-standing gradual 
increases only recently discovered.  Comparisons of the 
dates of species descriptions with their dates of discovery 
in Peter the Great Bay revealed that most introduced 
species of the region were known more than 100 years 
before they were discovered in the bay.  The majority of 
native macroscopic invertebrates, algae and plants 
recovered in recent surveys of Peter the Great Bay were 
also previously known.  These discoveries of introduced 
species were therefore, not likely to have been overlooked 
among previously unreported species.  More probable, 
these invasions are due to recent arrivals rather than to 
increases in research. 
 
The PICES surveys permit analyses of climate effects on 
the rates and patterns of invasions.  Nearly all of the 
introduced species discovered in Peter the Great Bay since 
2009 were previously known from southern East Asian 
countries (Zvyagintsev et al. 2009, 2011).  The restricted 
ranges and summer occurrences for most of these species 
are consistent with expanding southern populations or 
northern migration (Zvyagintsev et al. 2009, 2011).  The 
recent invasions of Russia found in the PICES survey 
appear also to be northern shifts or expanding ranges of 
warm water species.  The introduced and cryptogenic 
species found in the relatively pristine Vostok Bay area 
also indicate that they are not restricted to harbors and thus 
have broad distributions on the Russian coast, with 
significant potential to interact with valuable native 
populations. 
 
Relative to whether marine invasions can threaten human 
welfare: none of the human-borne introduced species found 
in the October 2011 and earlier surveys (Zvyagintsev et al. 
2009, 2011) are of economic value to Russia.  Since all of 
these species have the potential to displace or replace 
economically valuable native species, the common 
introduced species to Russia thus appear more likely to be 
harmful than useful and also unlikely to make positive 
contributions to the native biota. 
 
Population extinctions and displacement of native species 
coincident with introduced biological invasions are 
occurring in North America (Chapman et al., in press), as 
species equilibrium models have predicted.  Although 
invasions of the Russian coasts seem to be less intense than 
in North America, their rapid increases appear likely to 
soon bring them to North American intensities.  The PICES 
surveys provide critical information and a mechanism to 
foster the international cooperation needed for each 
member country to detect and manage introduced species.  
International collaborations through PICES are thus 
PICES Press Articles  Appendix 7 
170  PICES Scientific Report No. 48 
increasing the quality and resolution of taxonomic research 
on Asian coasts, increasing the resolution of invasion 
patterns and opening communications needed to permit 
relevant, cooperative responses to begin.

Introduction to Rapid Assessment Survey Methodologies 
for Detecting Non-indigenous Marine Species 
 
by Thomas Therriault 
 
 
 
Thanks to a contribution from the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan, through the 
Fisheries Agency of Japan (JFA), funding for a PICES 
project entitled “Development of the prevention systems for 
harmful organisms’ expansion in the Pacific Rim” has 
allowed Working Group 21 (http://www.pices.int/members/ 
working_groups/wg21.aspx) to advance its understanding of 
non-indigenous marine species in the North Pacific.  As 
highlighted in previous PICES Press articles, WG 21 has 
employed Rapid Assessment Surveys (RAS) to quickly 
characterize the native, non-native, and cryptogenic species 
present in coastal areas of different PICES member 
countries.  To date, RAS have been conducted in 2008 in 
Dalian (People’s Republic of China), in 2009 in Jeju 
(Republic of Korea), in 2010 in Newport (U.S.A.), and most 
recently near Vladivostok, Russia, in 2011 (see related 
PICES Press article in this issue).  In addition, this funding 
has allowed for capacity building in non-PICES member 
countries.  In July 2010, a pilot workshop was held at the 
Marine Station of Kobe University’s Center for Inland Seas 
(Awaji Island, Japan) to provide participants from 
developing countries with the tools to conduct RAS in their 
own waters (PICES Press, 2011, Vol. 19, No. 1, pp. 30–31). 
 
The positive feedback from workshop participants was so 
overwhelming that Drs. Thomas Therriault (Pacific Biological 
Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada) and Hiroshi Kawai 
(Kobe University, Japan) started planning for a larger RAS 
demonstration workshop for 2011.  Given the global nature 
of biological invasions, it was critical to engage researchers 
working on this important topic outside the six PICES 
member countries, especially those locations adjacent to 
the PICES region where the potential transport of non-
indigenous species is expected to be high.  The 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission’s Sub-
Commission for the Western Pacific (WESTPAC) has been 
assisting their member countries in studying marine non-
indigenous species since 2009, with a focus in Southeast 
Asia, and the shared interests of the two organizations 
represented an excellent opportunity to collaborate on 
marine non-indigenous species issues.  Dr. Apple Chavanich 
offered to host the joint workshop in Thailand, given its 
logistical benefits. 
 
Although specific methods vary slightly, based on habitats 
being sampled or taxonomic groups being characterized, 
WG 21 has developed methodologies that have been used 
within PICES member countries to identify non-indigenous 
species in both intertidal and subtidal habitats.  In addition, 
data from each of these surveys have been archived in the 
WG 21 database, thereby making it more broadly available.  
Thus, the objectives of the demonstration workshop on 
“Rapid Assessment Survey methodologies for detecting 
non-indigenous marine species” were to: 
(1) provide hands-on training to researchers from developing 
Southeast Asian countries concerned about the potential 
introduction of non-indigenous marine species;  
(2) introduce the PICES WG 21 database on non-
indigenous marine species; and  
(3) foster collaboration between PICES and WESTPAC.

Workshop participants explore the intertidal zone near the Phuket Marine Biological Center. 
 
Workshop participants engaged in sample processing and species identifications. 
 
The workshop was held July 19–21, 2011, at the Marine Biological 
Center, Phuket, Thailand, with more than 25 participants from the 
People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the 
Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.  
The workshop was supported by PICES, WESTPAC and the Phuket 
Marine Biological Center, and co-convened by Drs. Apple Chavanich 
(WESTPAC), Hiroshi Kawai (PICES), and Thomas Therriault (PICES). 
 
The workshop kicked off on Day 1 with a warm welcome from the 
Director of the Phuket Marine Biological Center, Mr. Wannakiat 
Thubthimsang.  Following an introduction from the co-convenors and 
with participants providing a bit of background about themselves, 
information about PICES and WESTPAC initiatives on non-indigenous 
marine species were discussed.  However, with the Marine Biological 
Center positioned right on the Andaman Sea, it did not take long to get 
to the hands-on part of the workshop, and participants visited a number 
of intertidal sites around the Center and the dock where a Thai research 
vessel was tied up.  Thus, participants were exposed to techniques for 
sampling a variety of different habitats and organisms.  Dr. Kawai 
supplemented algal collections by snorkelling in the warm (but murky) 
nearshore waters.  Loaded down with bags full of live samples, 
participants returned to the Marine Biological Center where they spent 
time identifying the various organisms they 
had collected.  On the second day the 
workshop shifted towards data collection and 
data sharing.  Dr. Therriault introduced the 
PICES WG 21 database on non-indigenous 
marine species developed by Drs. Henry Lee 
and Debbie Reusser.  This hierarchical database, 
based on marine eco-regions of the world, will 
allow participants from developing countries to 
archive their data in a systematic way that is 
then directly available both to them and to 
scientists from PICES member countries.  The 
afternoon saw a bit of free time emerge, and 
most participants visited the nearby Phuket 
Aquarium before regrouping for a wonderful 
all-you-can-eat seafood buffet.  The last day 
included a special lecture on how genetic 
techniques can be used to resolve invasion 
patterns in marine systems, and workshop 
attendees each provided an overview of the 
types of research they are conducting with 
respect to non-indigenous species. 
 
Overall, this workshop exposed participants to 
a background about marine non-indigenous 
species and why vigilance is required, using a 
series of short lectures, hands-on experience in 
making field collections in a variety of coastal 
environments, and laboratory experience using 
keys and reference material to identify organisms 
collected.  Since this workshop focused on 
background and techniques, actual taxonomic 
experts were not utilized in this demonstration 
but would play a critical role in actual RAS.  
Taxonomic experts have a broad knowledge of 
their taxonomic group amassed over time spent 
studying thousands of individuals from different 
geographical areas to resolve identifications – 
skills taxonomic generalists must develop to 
confidently resolve identifications (and potential 
invasion status).  Further, given that taxonomy 
for some species will be controversial and that 
reference collections are important to document 
the occurrence of non-indigenous species, it is 
imperative that voucher specimens be maintained 
for future reference.

The 7
th
 International Conference on Marine Bioinvasions 
 
by Lisa Drake and Thomas Therriault 
 
From August 23–25, 2011, the 7
th
 International Conference 
on Marine Bioinvasions—the first held in Europe—was 
convened in Barcelona, Spain.  Approximately 150 scientists, 
policy makers, and regulators from 20 countries in North 
America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia and New 
Zealand arrived in Barcelona to exchange ideas and discuss 
the latest findings and progress in the global effort to 
understand and reduce the delivery, establishment, and 
spread of marine invasive species. 
 
The Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) for the conference 
was composed of researchers from the international 
community: Jeb Byers (University of Georgia, U.S.A.), Jeff 
Crooks (Tijuana River NERR, U.S.A.), Lisa Drake (SSC 
Co-Chair; Naval Research Laboratory, U.S.A.), Graeme 
Inglis (National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, 
New Zealand), Anders Jelmert (Institute of Marine Research, 
Norway), Emma Johnston (University of New South Wales, 
Australia), Whitman Miller (Smithsonian Institution, 
U.S.A.), Henn Ojaveer (Estonian Marine Institute, 
Estonia), Gil Rilov (National Institute of Oceanography, 
Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research, Israel), 
Gemma Quílez-Badia (SSC Co-Chair and local host; World 
Wildlife Fund, Spain), Thomas Therriault (Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada), and Chela Zabin (Smithsonian Institution 
and University of California-Davis, U.S.A.).  Also, two 
technical advisors provided helpful input in preparing the 
conference: Jim Carlton (Williams College, U.S.A.) and 
Judith Pederson (MIT Sea Grant College Program, U.S.A.). 
 
The SSC benefited greatly from the work of the Local 
Organizing Committee, which was very capably led by 
Gemma Quílez-Badia and included: Ernesto Azzurro and 
Pep Gasol (Marine Science Institute of Barcelona, Spanish 
Council for Scientific Research), Xavier Turon (Centre for 
Advanced Studies of Blanes, Spanish Council for Scientific 
Research), and Luis Valdés (Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission of UNESCO, Paris). 
 
In addition to the efforts by the SSC and its advisors, the 
Local Organizing Committee, and three student interns, the 
conference received generous support from the North 
Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES), the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 
CosmoCaixa (Barcelona) and “La Caixa” (Barcelona).  
Fittingly, the conference was held at the sleek and modern 
CosmoCaixa, a state-of-the art science museum. 
 
The three invited plenary speakers began each day with 
timely and novel approaches to issues of invasive species 
research.  Bella Galil (National Institute of Oceanography, 
Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research, Israel) 
opened the conference by discussing the history of invasions 
to the Mediterranean Sea as well as gaps in our knowledge 
in this region.  Fabio Bulleri (Dipartimento di Scienze 
Botaniche Ecologiche e Geologiche, Università di Sassari, 
Italy) gave a thought-provoking talk suggesting that 
invasive species researchers should consider potential 
positive species interactions that can occur due to some 
invasions and how these relationships might be included in 
invasion models.  Lastly, Graeme Inglis (National Institute 
of Water and Atmospheric Research, New Zealand) provided 
insight into the dynamics of transporting species by 
shipping and the role of initial population size in successful 
colonization.  All plenary presentations were well received 
and became a starting point for continued discussion during 
coffee breaks, meals and especially over drinks. 
 
The Marine Bioinvasions Conference series continues to 
grow in popularity.  This year’s conference theme was 
“Advances and gaps in understanding marine bioinvasions” 
and, due to the many submissions for oral presentations 
(almost all of which were accommodated), the days were 
long with talks organized in two concurrent sessions.  Oral 
presentations were 15 minutes followed by five minutes for 
questions, which delegates felt was a good format, as it 
allowed conference participants to actively interact with 
speakers during the sessions.  In addition to general 
sessions, several special topic sessions were organized 
including: region-specific invasion research (this year, the 
Mediterranean Sea), application of new genetic tools for 
reconstructing invasion histories, ship biofouling as an 
understudied invasion vector, factors promoting the 
establishment and spread of invasive species, and 
management and eradication efforts.  In addition, a poster 
session that included approximately 40 posters was held at 
the museum on the first evening, and allowed presenters 
and attendees to mingle and learn about the latest findings 
in a relaxed atmosphere that included food and drinks 
(always a good motivator for discussions). 
 
An important part of conferences is the opportunity to 
informally discuss presentations, meet new colleagues, and 
forge new collaborations.  The breakfasts, coffee breaks, 
and lunches (held on site and consisting of traditional 
Spanish foods), allowed these happy interactions to 
proceed.  On the second evening of the conference, a 
reception was held on the museum grounds as the sun was 
setting.  Conference delegates were free to explore the 
museum during the day and were able to sightsee or go 
clubbing around the fabulous city of Barcelona at night. 
 
The input and participation of early-career scientists 
historically has been an important aspect of the Marine

Bioinvasions Conferences.  Indeed, this conference was no 
different.  Thanks to contributions from the sponsoring 
organizations, it was possible to provide travel support to 
22 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who applied.   
PICES supported the travel of eight graduate students (Max 
Castorani, Francis Choi, Catherine Clarke Murray, Samuel 
Collin, Annick Drouin, Paul Edwards, Anais Lacousière-
Roussel and Michael MacGillivary) and four postdoctoral 
fellows (Gail Ashton, April Blakeslee, Joao Canning Clode 
and Amy Fowler). 
 
In summary, the plenary talks, along with all of the 
presentations—approximately 140 papers and posters—
engendered lively discussions during the sessions, the 
breaks, and the social events.  The topics of the presentations 
were impressive: new ideas and approaches to invasion 
biology, clever field studies to address emerging hypotheses, 
and research results used to inform international policy.  
This clearly illustrates how the field of invasion biology 
has advanced since the first conference in 1999, owing 
largely to the researchers and policy makers who attend 
these conferences! 
 
In Barcelona, the SSC members developed a strategic plan 
for future conferences.  Our goals are to increase the 
geographic breadth of these meetings (since all but two of 
seven conferences have been held in the United States) and 
to encourage participation by researchers and decision 
makers from areas typically underrepresented at this forum: 
Asia, Central America, South America and Africa.  To that 
end, we devised the following schedule of conference 
locations: 2013 – Canada, 2015 – Australia, and 2017 – 
South America.  We are excited about the upcoming 
conferences and are confident they will strengthen existing 
collaborations and promote new ones.  In fact, planning has 
begun for the 8
th
 International Conference on Marine 
Bioinvasions, tentatively scheduled for the summer of 2013 
in Vancouver, Canada, so feel free to contact any of the SSC 
members, especially your PICES representatives, and keep an 
eye out for further details in future issues of PICES Press.

The 8
th
 International Conference on Marine Bioinvasions 
 
by Thomas Therriault and Lisa Drake 
 
From August 20–22, 2013, the 8
th
 International Conference 
on Marine Bioinvasions—the first held in Canada—was 
convened in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Approximately 
125 researchers, policy makers, and managers from 13 
countries in North America, South America, Europe, 
Australia/New Zealand, and Asia arrived in Vancouver to 
exchange ideas and discuss the latest findings and progress 
in the global effort to understand and reduce the delivery, 
establishment, and spread of marine invasive species.  This 
conference’s theme, “Biological Invasions in Changing 
Waters: Envelopes, Estuaries, and Evolution”, solicited 
papers on a variety of topics, including the role of some 
invasive species as ecosystem engineers, the intersection 
between invasive species and climate change, and the 
increasing use of molecular tools in invasive species 
studies.  In addition, a poster session was held on the first 
evening that allowed presenters and attendees to mingle 
and learn about the latest findings in a relaxed atmosphere 
that included pizza and drinks (always helpful for breaking 
the ice!).  A social gathering on the second night allowed 
continued discussion over snacks and drinks at the beautiful 
University of British Columbia gardens.  An important part 
of this conference is the opportunity to informally discuss 
presentations, meet new colleagues, and forge new 
contacts. 
To this end, coffee breaks and meals hosted on site allowed 
these happy interactions to take place in a relaxed and 
inviting setting.  On the last day conference delegates were 
free to explore the famed Beaty Biodiversity Museum on 
campus and each evening participants were able to sightsee 
or tour around Vancouver. 
 
The conference co-chairs (and co-authors of this article), 
Thomas Therriault (Fisheries and Oceans Canada) and Lisa 
Drake (Naval Research Laboratory, USA), were supported 
by a diverse, international Scientific Steering Committee 
(SSC) and an extremely productive Local Organizing 
Committee (LOC) headed by Cathryn Clarke Murray 
(World Wildlife Fund/University of British Columbia).  In 
addition to the efforts by the SSC and its advisors, the 
LOC, and three student interns, the conference received 
generous financial support from the North Pacific Marine 
Science Organization (PICES), the Second Canadian 
Aquatic Invasive Species Network (CAISN II), the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and the 
University of British Columbia (UBC).  The conference 
was held at the main campus of UBC in Vancouver which 
allowed easy access to the botanical gardens and the Beaty 
Biodiversity Museum.

The three invited plenary speakers began each day with 
timely and novel approaches to issues of invasive species 
research.  Emma Johnston (University of New South 
Wales, Sydney, Australia) opened the conference by 
discussing how marine ecosystems are under pressure from 
a wide variety of stressors, including invasive species, and 
that research needs to consider how invasive species 
interact with these other stressors, particularly the 
cumulative effects which are much less predictable.  James 
Carlton (Williams College – Mystic Seaport, USA) 
provided a moving and thought-provoking plenary about 
the potential introduction of invasive species associated 
with Japanese tsunami debris from the catastrophic 
magnitude 9.0 earthquake that hit off the coast of Japan in 
March 2011.  Lastly, Thomas Therriault (Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada, Nanaimo) provided an overview of 
CAISN II and highlighted advancements on better 
understanding European green crab invasion dynamics in 
British Columbia.  All presentations were well received 
and provided a starting point for continued discussion 
during coffee breaks, meals and especially over drinks.  
Plenary talks were followed by two concurrent sessions on 
each day and included topic sessions on: management of 
invaders, factors affecting invasion success, invasion 
vectors, invasion niche, invasion impacts, applying 
molecular tools, fish invasions, tunicate invasions, and crab 
invasions. 
 
The input and participation of early career scientists 
historically has been an important aspect of the Marine 
Bioinvasions Conferences, both due to the contributions of 
early career scientists and the benefits to their professional 
development by participating in such events.  Indeed, this 
conference was no different.   Thanks to funding from 
PICES, it was possible to provide travel support to 14 of the 
34 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who applied.  
PICES offered travel support to two undergraduate students 
(Stephanie Hall and Katherine Rolheiser), eight graduate 
students (Johanna Bradie, Farra Chan, Elizabeth Sheets, 
Darragh Clancy, Brian Turner, Max Castorani, Carolyn 
Tepolt, and Brian Cheng), and four postdoctoral fellows 
(Emily Brown, Amy Fowler, Christine McLaughlin, and 
Amanda Kelley).  Many of these award recipients were 
captured in a group photo. 
 
In summary, the plenary talks, along with all of the 
presentations—approximately 110 papers and posters—
engendered lively discussions during the sessions, the 
breaks, and the social events.  The topics of the presentations 
were impressive: new ideas and approaches to invasion 
biology, clever field studies to address emerging hypotheses, 
and research results used to inform national and 
international policy.  This clearly illustrates how the field 
of invasion biology has advanced since the first conference 
in 1999, owing largely to the researchers and policy makers 
who attend these conferences! 
 
Planning has begun for the 9
th
 International Marine 
Bioinvasions Conference tentatively scheduled for January 
2016 in Sydney, Australia, and the 10
th
 International Marine 
Bioinvasions Conference tentatively scheduled for 2018 in 
Argentina, so keep an eye out for further details in future 
issues of PICES Press.

Didemnum vexillum (a colonial tunicate invader) smothering Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) cultivated in 
British Columbia and an example of the hierarchical biogeographical classification system used for  
WG 21’s database and Atlas (Lee II, H. and Reusser, D.A., 2012) that allows a quick visualization of global 
invasion status.  The example shows the spread of the tunicate Molgula manhattensis, native to the 
Northeast Atlantic, to the eastern and western sides of the North Pacific.
