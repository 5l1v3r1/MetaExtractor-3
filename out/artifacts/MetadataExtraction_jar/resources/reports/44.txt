PICES Scientific Report No. 44  xiii 
 
 
Executive Summary 
 
 
PICES Working Group on Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture (WG 24) was established in 
October 2008, under the direction the Marine Environmental Quality Committee (MEQ) and Fishery Science 
Committee (FIS), with the following terms of reference: 
 Evaluate approaches currently being used in the different PICES countries to assess and model the 
interactions of aquaculture operations with surrounding environments.  
 Review and assess current risk assessment methods used to assess environmental interactions of 
aquaculture and determine what, if anything should be changed for application in PICES countries to 
reflect ecosystem-specific aspects.  Following the review and assessment, identify appropriate case studies 
to compare results among countries in the PICES region.  
 Assess methods to detect, identify, evaluate and report on infectious disease events and potential 
interactions between wild and farmed marine animals. If appropriate, develop a recommended 
standardized approach for detection/evaluation/reporting from wild and cultured populations.  The focus of 
this activity will be on OIE-notifiable diseases and other infectious diseases of regional/economic 
importance.  
 
This report is a summary of the activities that WG 24 undertook from 2009 to 2012.  The Working Group, with 
the guidance of FIS and MEQ, refined the activities under the terms of reference so that each PICES member 
country with active Working Group members could contribute to the report.  This refinement was required due 
to the different types of expertise needed to meet the three very different activities outlined in the terms of 
reference.  Additionally, due to external factors, there was a concomitant challenge in attracting current and 
new members with expertise in marine aquaculture as well as the resources to dedicate to active participation 
in the Working Group.  
 
Through topic sessions, workshops and targeted Working Group activities, different aspects of sustainable 
marine aquaculture research relevant to WG 24’s terms of reference were highlighted.  Research activities in 
all PICES member countries focus on identifying aquaculture–environment interactions, whether to model the 
impacts or to minimize them through optimizing culture approaches, as well as on research related to disease 
identification and management. 
 
While there are significant differences in species cultured, culture production method and extent, and the 
regulatory and management structure in place in the different PICES member countries, the Working Group 
identified some common issues related to environmental interactions of marine aquaculture.  These are as 
follows:   
 Marine finfish culture has a more significant influence on the environment than shellfish or algal culture, 
primarily due to the addition of feed, which can influence the physical, chemical and biological 
composition and structure of the seafloor below the culture operations; 
 The extent of environmental interactions depends greatly on local physical conditions; 
 Near-field, or localized, effects are more substantial than far-field (i.e., hundreds of meters or further) 
effects; 
 Far-field effects are not well characterized or researched; 
 Rates of ecosystem recovery depend on local physical conditions, but are generally rapid in environments 
with high water flow; 
Executive Summary 
xiv  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
 Most PICES member countries are at least examining, if not applying, integrated multi-trophic aquaculture 
to mitigate and improve interactions; 
 Pathogen detection and diagnoses are informed by OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) standards; 
 Development and validation of diagnostic methods and dissemination of those methods are ongoing in most 
PICES member countries; and 
 It is recognized that pathogens can transfer between wild and cultured fish. 
 
Although the original terms of reference requested the Working Group to review and evaluate risk assessment 
approaches for aquaculture, it was determined that while scientific risk assessment of aquaculture activities are 
being undertaken in PICES member countries, the organizations that are active within PICES are not always 
the organizations responsible for undertaking these assessments.  Therefore, the second term of reference was 
modified to focus less on risk assessment per se, but instead on providing an overview of the legislative 
framework for evaluating environmental interactions of aquaculture which integrate, either explicitly or 
implicitly, aspects of risk assessment.  An overview of aquaculture regulatory research was also undertaken in 
order to provide information on funding sources and institutions that have expertise in aquaculture–
environmental interactions research. 
 
Based on the experience of WG 24 and the direction of PICES under its FUTURE science plan, some marine 
aquaculture issues and analysis can be more holistically addressed through expert groups that include 
consideration of anthropogenic stressor effects on the marine environment.  Additionally, any future marine 
aquaculture-related PICES expert group should be more narrowly focused to not only allow for more directed 
work, but also to increase the likelihood of experts from all PICES member countries being able to participate 
and contribute.  As well, it is clear that active participation from all PICES member countries is key to 
realizing a complete analysis of sustainable marine aquaculture issues.  
 
This report is composed of three sections: Assessing environmental interactions of marine aquaculture, marine 
aquaculture legislative frameworks and environmental interactions research, and pathogens of aquatic animals 
organized as country reports followed by a summary and recommendations, and appendices which include 
WG 24 terms of reference (Appendix 1), WG 24 membership (Appendix 2), WG 24 annual reports and topic 
session/workshop summaries (Appendix 3), and a PICES Press news article (Appendix 4).

1 Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture:  
A Review of Long- and Short-Term, Near- and Far-Field  
Effects of Marine Aquaculture on Benthic Communities, 
Including Chemical and Physical Changes, and Rates  
of Ecosystem Recovery in PICES Member Countries
 
1.1 Overview  
 
This report outlines and summarizes research that has been conducted to date on the environmental interactions 
of marine aquaculture in PICES member countries, with a focus on interactions with the benthic environment and 
communities, and spatial (near and far field) and temporal (short and long term) scales, and concluding with 
recommendations for future work.  While the species of fish and shellfish being cultured and methods being used 
to culture them differ between countries, there are many similarities in the types and extent of benthic 
environmental interactions of marine aquaculture.  In most cases marine fish culture has more significant 
influence on the environment than shellfish or algae culture, primarily because most fish culture requires feed and 
that adds more waste to the system which can influence the physical, chemical and biological composition and 
structure of the seafloor below culture operations.  Other similarities are that (1) the extent of environmental 
interactions depends greatly on local physical conditions, (2) near-field effects are more substantial than far-field 
effects, but the latter are less researched, (3) rates of ecosystem recovery depend on local physical conditions, but 
are generally rapid in environments with high water flow, and (4) most PICES member countries are at least 
examining, and some are applying, integrated multi-trophic aquaculture to mitigate and improve interactions.  
These reviews complement previous international efforts (Costa-Pierce 2008; GESAMP 2008; Soto et al., 2008; 
Phillips et al., 2009).  Given the focus of PICES on marine science and fisheries, the expanding and important 
role of aquaculture relative to fisheries in a number of PICES member countries, the history of marine 
aquaculture and resulting differences in social culture and legislative frameworks amongst PICES member 
countries (see Section 2), and each country’s approach to ensuring the health of its domestic farmed aquatic 
animals (Section 3), this report will hopefully serve as a good reference and lead to further discussion and 
application to implementing sustainable aquaculture development at the ecosystem scale  (Costa-Pierce, 2010) in 
PICES member countries.

1.2 Canada 
 
1.2.1 Overview 
In 2009, the production of Canadian farmed seafood 
was 155,000 tonnes, valued at $800 million CAD 
(ca. $700 million USD in 2009).  Of this, finfish 
aquaculture produced 118,000 tonnes or 76% of total 
aquaculture production, of which 93% was salmon 
(valued at $653 million CAD (ca. $572 million USD 
in 2009)).  Shellfish production was 34,000 tonnes 
(valued at $64 million CAD (ca. $56 million USD in 
2009)), with over two thirds, or 68%, of the shellfish 
production, and half the market value, coming from 
mussel aquaculture.  Aquaculture takes place in all 
ten Canadian provinces and the Yukon Territory.  
Production of Atlantic salmon, Chinook salmon, 
trout, Arctic char, blue mussels, oysters, and clams is 
well established. Several other species including 
halibut, sturgeon, tilapia, sablefish and scallops are at 
various stages of development (DFO, 2009). 
 
The interactions between marine aquaculture and the 
environment are actively being studied in Canada by 
federal government, academic and industry 
researchers.  In 2009, a review of the scientific 
knowledge related to the potential effects of marine 
aquaculture on the environment was undertaken.  
This review included an examination of the potential 
near- and far-field benthic effects on the environment 
from finfish and shellfish farms.  The analysis below 
is largely taken from the review papers by Page et al. 
(in press), focusing on finfish aquaculture, and 
Chamberlain and Page (in press), focusing on 
shellfish aquaculture, (available at www.dfo-
mpo.gc.ca/csas). 
1.2.2 Fish Culture 
Finfish farming in Canada is dominated by Atlantic 
salmon aquaculture.  Based on both empirical and 
modelling studies, there is strong evidence supporting 
a linkage between the release of waste feed and fish 
feces and changes in the physical, chemical and 
biological composition and structure of the soft-
bottom habitat in close proximity to the finfish farm.  
However, the extent of changes is known to be site-
dependent, as the processes which control the scale of 
effects from waste feed and feces are dependent on 
local environmental conditions such as temperature, 
season, hydrography, flushing, bottom type, and 
bathymetry as well as the characteristics of the 
ecosystem. 
Near-field effects  
The extent of the potential effects on the 
environment from waste feed and feces will depend 
on the quantity of feed that is used which, in turn, 
depends on the species being cultivated and the age 
of the cultivated fish, the time of year and the 
management practices at the farm.  While there are 
no available empirical data on the proportion of feed 
that enters the environment as fines (fine particulate 
matter), it is assumed that this will depend both on 
the hardness of the feed and the method of feed 
handling and delivery.   
 
Feed wastage rates are not well quantified, with very 
few direct measurements available, but typical 
wastage rates for current farm operations are thought 
  
Section 1  Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   3 
to be 5% or less.  Chamberlain and Stucchi (2007) 
estimated that a feed wastage rate of 5% or greater 
will constitute more than 50% of the total flux rate of 
carbon to the bottom, whereas wastage rates of 2–3% 
are estimated to result in 20–30% of the carbon flux 
to the bottom.  Consistent with a 2–3% rate of feed 
wastage is the estimation by Ackefors and Enell 
(1994) that the proportion of feed, in terms of 
organic carbon, that accumulates on the bottom is 
about 23% of the material released from the farm.  
Measured bulk sedimentation rates under and near 
salmon mariculture cages can vary significantly  
(>1–181 g C m
–2
 d

), dependent on environmental 
conditions, farm size, fish stocking densities and 
variations associated with measurement methodologies 
(Wildish et al., 2004).  However, sedimentation rates 
in areas without fish farms are typically in the range 
of 0.1 to 1 g C m
–2
 d
–1
. 
 
Modelling of waste deposition from finfish farms is 
being used in Canada in order to predict the footprint 
of the farm, design sampling protocols for 
monitoring purposes and to assess the potential 
impact on the physical, chemical and biological 
properties of the ecosystem.  Based on the sinking 
rates of feed, fecal and bio-fouling particulate 
materials, for most Canadian finfish farms the 
majority of the released materials will sink to the 
bottom before being decomposed or ingested by wild 
organisms.  The initial bottom exposure associated 
with waste feed particulates is usually within a few 
tens of metres of the net pen array, but can be in the 
range of a few hundred metres in deeper water 
(Brooks and Mahnken, 2003). 
Physical changes   
The physical changes associated with the deposition 
of feces and feed depend, in part, on whether the 
bottom type is soft or hard.  Soft-bottom sites are 
generally better characterized, and are more prone to 
smothering.  However, waste feed, if found on the 
bottom in vicinity of farms, tends to be in patches 
rather than evenly or randomly spread throughout the 
spatial domain of the net pen or farm lease.  The 
accumulation of wastes is also dependent on currents 
and tides, which may act to remove wastes from the 
vicinity of the farms, and will also impact the sinking 
rates of both feed and feces.   
 
Although research has focused primarily on the 
potential impacts on soft-bottom substrates, new 
research is being undertaken in British Columbia 
(and Newfoundland) that is focusing on hard-bottom 
substrates (see http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/ 
enviro/aquaculture/parr-prra/types-eng.asp for project 
overviews and information).  This research is 
focusing on both the changes that can be observed or 
sampled, as well as sampling techniques for 
monitoring changes. In Newfoundland, finfish farms 
tend to be located over hard substrates that are 
homogenous.  The accumulation of waste feed and 
feces may be modulated by currents; however, 
whether this occurs is site-dependent.  In terms of 
physical changes, a flocculant layer of waste can be 
found below finfish cages located above the hard 
ocean substrates.  In British Columbia, sites that have 
been characterized as having hard substrates have 
been found to be heterogeneous in nature, with some 
hard substrates mixed in with sponge reefs and soft 
substrate patches.  This complicates the analysis of 
potential impacts from waste feed and feces, as well 
as sampling methodology for assessing biological 
impacts. 
Chemical changes   
Adding waste food and finfish feces to the 
environment results in the addition of nutrients.  
Decomposition and leaching will break down this 
added organic material, which then results in an 
increase in dissolved oxygen demand, and releases 
breakdown products into the sediment and water 
column.  Breakdown rates of waste feed for the Bay 
of Fundy area, New Brunswick, have been estimated 
at 5 days to decompose 49% of the carbon within the 
sediments under finfish farms (Strain and Hargrave, 
2005).  This estimate is based on measurements of 
the organic carbon content and oxygen uptake rates 
of surface sediments with high concentrations of feed 
pellets and fish feces, and suggests that most of the 
organic material that is released from finfish farms 
will decompose on the bottom rather than in the 
water column, and that sediments should chemically 
recover quickly (i.e., within weeks).  This conclusion 
is consistent with observations (Brooks and Mahken, 
2003).   
 
For soft-bottom habitats, the near-field consequences 
of organic enrichment from aquaculture on the 
physical/chemical aspects of the habitat include 
changes in sediment organic content, pore water 
dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, redox potential, 
sulphide content, vertical structure of the sediments, 
and chemical composition of the sediment 
(sulphides, hydrogen sulphide, methane, carbon 
Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture  Section 1 
4  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
dioxide).  The extent of these changes is related to 
the extent of organic enrichment and local environ-
mental conditions. 
Biological changes   
In general, the effects on the benthic macrofaunal 
community in response to influxes of organic 
materials have been well characterized for soft-
bottom habitats following a paradigm of species 
succession along organic enrichment gradients as 
established by Pearson and Rosenberg (1978).  The 
consequences from organic enrichment (regardless of 
source) can include changes in biodiversity, species 
richness and abundance, community structure, and a 
change in trophic structure. 
 
In soft-bottom habitats, the sediment–water interface 
is usually aerobic and contains abundant resident 
macrofaunal and meiofaunal communities.  The 
deposition of feed-related nutrients (i.e., organic-rich 
materials) results in an increase in aerobic bacteria 
activity to metabolize the added organic materials.  
When the rate of deposition exceeds the capacity of 
aerobic bacteria to metabolize this material, then 
anaerobic pathways predominate which can lead to 
the development of hypoxic and/or anoxic 
environments.  In response, the benthic infauna 
either die off, migrate to the surface layer or the 
oxygenated water layer above the anoxic zone, or 
extend and build up their tubes or siphons above the 
anoxic layer.  Death of burrowing macrofauna leads 
to a rapid decline in the capacity for aeration of the 
water within the upper sediment profile and a more 
rapid development of anoxia.  In the anoxic interface 
layer, anaerobic bacteria, principally sulphate 
reducers and methanogenic bacteria, become 
prominent. Colonization by opportunistic macrofaunal 
species that are tolerant of low dissolved oxygen and 
relatively high levels of hydrogen sulphide, including 
Beggiatoa, and opportunistic polychaete worms 
(OPC) may occur.  In the transition zone between the 
aerobic and anaerobic zones, low oxygen tolerant 
species that can exploit the transitional habitat may 
dominate.   
 
On hard-bottom habitats, the effects of increased 
organic deposition may be varied.  There may be an 
increase in abundance of suspension and deposit 
feeding invertebrate species, such as anemones and 
brittle stars.  However, certain deeper-water sessile 
invertebrate species (e.g., glass sponges, Gorgonian 
corals, large soft corals, etc.) may be particularly 
sensitive to increased sedimentation, increased 
organic input or low dissolved oxygen levels and 
may, therefore, be excluded from the benthic 
community in the vicinity of marine finfish cage 
aquaculture (AMR, 2007).  As well, there may be a 
reduction or elimination of small, low profile, sessile 
species (i.e., hydroids, serpulid worms, tunicates, 
jingle shells, brachiopods, and encrusting sponges) 
due to physical smothering from the accumulation of 
fine sediments (AMR, 2007).  Similar to soft-bottom 
habitats, the sulphur bacteria Beggiatoa sp. may be 
found in hard-bottom habitats in the vicinity of 
marine finfish cage culture if the decomposition of 
organic material has led to hypoxic sediments and 
water at the sediment–water interface.  A complex of 
OPC may be found under similar conditions close to 
marine finfish farms either in conjunction with, or 
independent of, Beggiatoa sp. 
Far-field effects  
The intensity of organic loading on the sea floor at 
distances of hundreds of metres or greater from the net 
pen array tends to be dominated by fecal release 
(Chamberlain and Stucchi, 2007), and this loading is 
considerably smaller than in the near field because the 
total mass of organics released as feces is generally 
less than for feed, and is also generally distributed 
over a larger area.  The loading from flocculation is 
spread over even larger scales (kilometres) at even 
lower rates (Milligan and Law, 2005). 
 
Resuspension and bedload transport can result in the 
expansion of the initial exposure domain.  However, 
the extent to which these processes influence the 
exposure to finfish farm organic wastes is still 
uncertain and the subject of on-going research. 
 
There is very limited empirical or model-based 
evidence to characterize the extent of a broader range 
of exposure to finfish wastes (e.g., Cromey et al., 
2002; Brooks and Mahnken, 2003; Chamberlain and 
Stucchi, 2007) which may be due, in part, to 
sampling design (i.e., limited sampling beyond a few 
hundred metres from net pen arrays) and a lack of 
sensitivity in distinguishing between farm-source 
wastes and background levels.  Targeted research 
studies are being undertaken within Canada to 
parameterize the resuspension of wastes from both 
finfish and shellfish farms over different benthic 
substrate compositions in order to contribute to 
addressing some of the uncertainties related to the 
resuspension and transport of mariculture wastes, 
Section 1  Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   5 
and thereby contribute to improving model 
predictions for finfish (and shellfish) farm footprints 
(more information regarding this research can be 
found at http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/enviro/ 
aquaculture/parr-prra/types-eng.asp). 
Chemical changes 
The degree to which the release of dissolved 
nutrients and organics from cultured finfish 
operations, either directly or indirectly from the 
decomposition of wasted fish feed and feces, 
contributes to the pelagic loading of these substances 
will depend on the stocking density of fish and the 
oceanographic conditions of the area. The respiration 
of the fish and biological oxygen demand associated 
with the decomposition processes in both the water 
column and the bottom will also contribute to the 
removal of dissolved oxygen from the water column.  
Additionally, the benthic decomposition processes 
that occur may lead to the injection of hydrogen 
sulphide, carbon dioxide and methane gasses into the 
water column (reviewed in Wildish et al., 2004). 
 
There is relatively little literature demonstrating 
eutrophication of the coastal zone associated with 
finfish culture in Canada.  Nutrient loading may be 
linked to stocking densities, and may correspond to 
periods of peak production.  One of the challenges 
associated with identifying the potential effects from 
nutrient additions from finfish aquaculture operations 
is that there are often many anthropogenic sources of 
nutrients.  Another challenge is that nutrients are 
rapidly transformed through the primary production 
process. 
 
The extent that nutrients may be re-suspended and 
transported depends on both physical and sedimen-
tological processes.  Tidal flow, residual circulation, 
patterns of turbulence, wind and wave energy, and 
flocculation (aggregation) will determine the large-
scale patterns of particle dispersion.  The distance 
and location of accumulation are, therefore, highly 
site-specific and dependent on bottom topography, 
currents, erosion and flocculation processes that will 
affect the residence time of the material both within 
the water column and on the seafloor (reviewed by 
Hargrave, 2003). 
Biological changes   
Should the sedimentation rates at a bay scale be 
enhanced through flocculation of waste feed or feces 
from finfish farms, it is possible that fine particulates 
may coat algae, thus reducing their growth potential, 
and resulting in bay-scale ecological changes.   
 
The biological consequences of pelagic organic and 
nutrient loading from finfish aquaculture depend on a 
number of other factors (i.e., loading rates, water 
exchange, water column stratification, light pene-
tration, vertical mixing, other anthropogenic 
activities, etc.).  Although there is very little research 
that has examined potential pelagic biological effects 
of finfish aquaculture activities, the results available 
are further complicated by a number of influencing 
factors and the lack of reliable tracers for soluble 
nutrients from fish farms (Olsen et al., 2008). 
 
The dissolved forms of nitrogen and phosphorus that 
are excreted by the cultured fish are available to 
phytoplankton (microalgae), which may result in an 
increase in phytoplankton biomass downstream from 
marine finfish aquaculture sites.  However, based on 
monitoring results, dissolved inorganic nitrogen 
concentrations outside marine finfish aquaculture 
cages are low at the perimeter of net pens, and 
essentially undetectable above background levels at 
30 m downcurrent from the pens (reviewed in 
Brooks and Mahnken, 2003).  In the Pacific 
Northwest (Black and Forbes, 1997) and in the Bay 
of Fundy, phytoplankton production is believed to be 
light limited rather than nutrient limited (Harrison et 
al., 2005; Sowles, 2005).  Therefore, the input of 
dissolved nutrients from marine finfish aquaculture 
into the marine environment is unlikely to have a 
measurable effect on phytoplankton density. 
 
In shallow water littoral and intertidal zones 
proximal to finfish aquaculture sites, nutrient 
enrichment can stimulate the extensive development 
of macroalgal beds, which have a large capacity for 
nutrient uptake (Hargrave 2003) that may or may not 
be realized (GESAMP, 2008).  This has led to the 
development of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture 
approaches which include the cultivation of 
extractive species such as shellfish and seaweeds. 
 
The species community composition of benthic 
macrofauna distant from finfish aquaculture sites has 
not been extensively studied.  Long-term monitoring 
in some areas has generally not found altered benthic 
community structure or biomass in the far field, but 
this result is also dependent on the geographic 
location, depth, and bathymetry of the site.   
 
Overall, there has been a focus on the near-field 
environmental interactions with finfish aquaculture 
Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture  Section 1 
6  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
activities.  The potential for far-field and cumulative 
effects associated with multiple farms has yet to be 
investigated.  
Rates of recovery  
Fallowing of sites is used as a management measure 
in order to allow for chemical recovery of the benthic 
substrate around finfish net pens.  For soft-bottom 
habitats, once the excess of organic loading ceases, 
the bottom will recovery naturally. Chemical 
recovery can occur within weeks to months, whereas 
biological recovery can take from several months to 
2 or more years (Brooks and Mahnken, 2003).  The 
length of time for recovery is dependent on the local 
environmental conditions. 
 
1.2.3 Shellfish Culture 
Shellfish culture in Canada is dominated by 
suspended mussel culture, which accounted for two 
thirds of the total shellfish production and half the 
shellfish market value in 2009.  Suspended bottom 
and near-bottom culture of oysters, intertidal clam 
culture and scallops are also commercially cultured 
in Canada.  In addition, there are on-going efforts to 
expand commercial culture to include other shellfish 
species, including geoducks, quahogs and sea urchins 
(DFO, 2009). 
 
The majority of research on the environmental 
interactions of shellfish aquaculture in Canada has 
focused on the interactions between the environment 
and suspended mussel culture.  However, as part of a 
2006 Fisheries and Oceans Canada science advisory 
process, it was concluded that most effects of bivalve 
aquaculture are related to the scale (i.e., intensity and 
extent) of the aquaculture activity, rather than the 
type of infrastructure (DFO, 2006).  Thus, this report 
will focus primarily on the effects from suspension 
culture, and will be based largely on the Aquaculture 
Pathways of Effects review (as above), the 2011 
review by McKindsey et al., and on the scientific 
literature related to suspended mussel culture. 
Near-field effects  
Suspension culture 
 Physical changes   
The addition of cultured bivalves creates habitat 
through the addition of both concrete anchor blocks 
and the mussels and socks that contain them.  This 
addition of structure leads to the addition of habitat 
and refuges for other invertebrate organisms as well 
as macroalgae.  In addition to the creation of habitat, 
the placement of the anchor blocks can result in 
localized destruction of habitat immediately under 
the blocks.  Cultured bivalves that fall off the socks 
can also create benthic habitat that is conducive to 
supporting organisms more commonly found 
associated with hard substrates rather than the soft-
substrate habitat that is commonly found where 
bivalve culture is undertaken in Canada (see review 
by McKindsey et al., 2011). 
 
The addition of suspended bivalve culture infra-
structure can influence hydrodynamic circulation 
patterns, depending on the spacing of lines, stocking 
densities, etc.  If there are bay-wide changes in 
hydrodynamics (i.e., localized areas of slower 
currents, etc.), they will be specific to the local 
geography and hydrography. 
 
In addition to the above physical changes, 
biodeposition of feces and pseudofeces from cultured 
bivalves may result in an alteration in the nutrient 
pathways, as well as the accumulation and re-
mineralization of the organic matter.  As with finfish 
farms, the extent that this may occur is specific to the 
stocking density and rate of biodeposit production, 
initial dispersion of the feces and pseudofeces, 
redistribution on the seafloor, and the rate of decay 
(see McKindsey et al., 2011). 
 Chemical changes   
The translocation of organic matter from pelagic to 
benthic food webs and the excretion of ammonia by 
cultured shellfish can alter the nutrient dynamics 
(e.g., recycling rates, retention of nutrients in coastal 
systems, nutrient ratios) which, in turn, may affect 
habitat and community structure (Cranford et al., 
2006).  
 
Similar to the addition of waste finfish feed and 
feces, the addition of biodeposits from cultured 
bivalves may result in an organic enrichment of the 
benthic community. Depending on the extent of 
organic enrichment and the local conditions, this may 
result in chemical changes in the benthic sediment 
due to microbial metabolism of the added organic 
materials.  In addition to the local physical and 
bathymetric environment, stocking density, age 
structure and placement of mussel lines will 
Section 1  Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   7 
influence the extent of organic enrichment and 
potential for shifts in the benthic sediment condition 
along the oxic to anoxic spectrum.  
 Biological changes   
Dense bivalve populations, as found under culture 
conditions, can filter large volumes of water, 
exploiting the diverse nature of suspended particulate 
matter (the seston), including phytoplankton, ciliates, 
flagellates, zooplankton and detritus.  The rate of 
filter feeding will influence the extent of local 
reduction or depletion of the seston by the cultured 
mussels.  The filtration rate by mussels has been 
found to vary seasonally, and diurnally, compounding 
the factors required to be considered in assessing the 
potential influence of mussel culture on the pelagic 
community. 
 
Generally speaking, cultured bivalves added to an 
ecosystem can be anticipated to alter the water column 
biodiversity, particle size and trophic structure through 
filter feeding.  The flushing rate of the bay in which 
bivalve aquaculture is occurring and the phytoplankton 
renewal time will determine not only the sustainability 
of the volume of culture (biomass) that can be 
supported (production and ecosystem carrying 
capacity) but also whether there are consequences to 
the trophic structure.  The potential for bivalve 
aquaculture to influence the trophic structure within 
the local ecosystem due to removal of specific size 
ranges (2–8 µm) of phytoplankton through filter 
feeding has not been assessed. 
 
The addition of suspended bivalve culture to an area 
has been shown to create habitat and refuges for 
diverse assemblages of organisms, and to provide a 
direct food source for other invertebrates.  Biofouling 
organisms associated with suspended bivalve culture 
include macroalgae, barnacles, hydroids, tunicates, 
mussel spat and polychaetes.  Similarly, the addition 
of physical structure, either associated with the 
anchors or mussels that have fallen off, can provide 
habitat for organisms that are typically found 
associated with hard substrates rather than with soft 
substrates. The introduction of biofouling organisms, 
particularly non-native tunicates and green crab, 
during shellfish transfers is of concern.  
 
As with finfish farming, when chemical changes 
associated with the addition of organic nutrients 
occurs, there is a biological response whereby the 
benthic infauna productivity may decline if the 
benthic substrate has high toxic sulphide levels 
(Cranford et al., 2003). 
Far-field effects  
Far-field effects from suspended bivalve cultures 
depend on the specific characteristics of the site (e.g., 
bathymetry and hydrodynamic regime) and the 
culture operation (e.g., farm size, stocking density, 
age of operation, age distribution of stock, line 
placement).  Research is being done in Canada to 
develop models to predict bay-scale and farm-scale 
effects using site-specific data ranging from flushing 
rate, phytoplankton renewal time, stocking densities, 
hydrodynamic and bathymetry information, as well 
as biodeposition rates.  While this research is still 
being undertaken, initial results suggest that within a 
bay, there are localized areas with different renewal 
times, which suggest that model predictions of far-
field interactions may require more complexity, 
particularly if these models are to be used by 
management. 
  
Far-field benthic effects may occur through different 
mechanisms, including through the aggregation of 
macrofauna at culture sites, changes in plankton 
communities through size selection filter feeding or 
stimulation of primary productivity due to an 
increase in nutrient availability and cycling rates, or 
through the addition of habitat that supports 
increases in pest species (Cranford et al., 2003; 
McKindsey et al., 2011). 
 
1.2.4 Marine Algae Culture 
Very little marine algae are cultured in Canada, and 
as such, there is limited research or analysis 
regarding either near- or far-field effects. 
 
1.2.5 Polyculture/Integrated Multi-Trophic 
Aquaculture 
Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) 
research has been underway in Canada since 2001.  
Starting in 2010, a 5-year strategic network, the 
Canadian Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture 
Network  (CIMTAN),  was  funded  (http://www.cim
tan.ca).  This network is designed to facilitate a more 
strategic approach to Canadian IMTA research 
focusing in three areas: (1) environmental research 
Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture  Section 1 
8  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
(ecological design, ecosystem interactions, bio-
mitigative efficiency, and regulatory science),  
(2) system innovation and engineering, and  
(3) economic viability and social acceptance.   
 
Some of the research within this network is focusing 
on assessing candidate organic extractive species 
based on capture and conversion efficiencies, 
identifying the temporal and spatial patterns of 
nutrient and organic particle plumes within IMTA 
systems and the role of microbes in recycling 
nutrients, and optimizing stocking densities and 
infrastructure in order to maximize system 
efficiencies.   Additional information on these and 
other CIMTAN projects can be found at the CIMTAN 
website and in the Canadian Aquaculture R&D 
Review  (http://www.aquacultureassociation.ca/aac-
news/canadian-aquaculture-rd-review). 
 
1.2.6 Discussion, Analysis, and 
Recommendations 
Aquaculture is one of many anthropogenic activities 
that is undertaken in coastal zones in Canada.  
Through siting and licensing requirements, the 
various regulatory responsibilities in Canada aim to 
mitigate and manage potential impacts.  There 
continue to be a number of scientific knowledge gaps 
related to potential environmental interactions with 
aquaculture, particularly related to being able to 
assess the cumulative effects of other coastal zone 
activities, cascading ecological feedbacks from 
specific effects (e.g., the effect of cultured bivalves 
removing seston between 2–8 µm on zooplankton 
and other trophic levels), validated models of 
interactions, and far-field consequences of 
environmental interactions with either shellfish or 
finfish aquaculture (or in the case of IMTA, both).  
Research in these areas is being undertaken in 
Canada and internationally.  Addressing these 
knowledge gaps will improve the ability to interpret, 
assess and manage the environmental interactions of 
marine aquaculture within an ecosystem context.

1.3 Japan  
 
1.3.1 Overview 
In Japan, marine aquaculture produced 1,146,000 
metric tons and 418 billion yen (ca. 5 billion US$) in 
2009, 20% and 26% of Japanese fisheries production 
in terms of volume and value, respectively. Since 
mariculture generates large amounts of organic 
wastes and nutrients in and around aquaculture 
facilities, it may have large impacts on the benthic 
environment.  Feeding aquaculture (fish farming) 
discharges a large amount of organic waste into the 
benthic environment.  Although non-fed aquaculture 
(shellfish culture, algae culture) has less impact, 
intensive and long-term culture activity causes 
eutrophication and hypoxia due to feces and 
associated remnants which may alter the benthic 
communities in the culture area. 
 
1.3.2 Fish Culture 
Yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) and red sea 
bream (Pagrus major) are the main species reared in 
finfish cage culture in Japan.  The net cage culture of 
bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) began recently. 
Fish farming generates large amounts of waste in the 
form of particulate organic matter, dissolved organic 
matter and nutrients.  In Japan, the negative effects 
have become conspicuous since the commencement 
of large-scale fish farming in the mid-1960s and its 
subsequent rapid development during the 1970s and 
1980s.  A large amount of organic matter is 
discharged into the surrounding area resulting in 
chemical and biological changes of the benthic 
environment in and around the culture facilities. 
Near-field effects  
Physical changes  
Organic wastes (feces and uneaten feed) derived 
from fish farming facilities settle on the seabed. In 
Japan, fish farming is often conducted intensively in 
enclosed basins and large amounts of sludge 
accumulate on the seafloor.  In such cases, the 
dredging of sludge under the farming facilities is 
conducted occasionally to treat the benthic environment 
even if its sustainability is in doubt.  
Chemical changes   
A large amount of feed is used to culture fish and a 
large proportion of resulting organic matter is 
discharged into the environment in various forms. 
The flux of organic matter has been investigated 
mainly from laboratory rearing experiments 
(Yokoyama, 2010).  The proportion of organic 
matter retrieved as harvested fish has been estimated 
to be 12% of the total nitrogen in minced raw fish 
feed (Mie Prefectural Fisheries Experimental Station, 
1983) and 26% of total dry matter in the case of 
moist pellets feed (Watanabe, 1991).  The remainder 
(88 or 74% of the total input of organic matter) 
results in a load to the surrounding water body. 
Particulate organic matter that is comprised of fecal 
matter and waste feed settles on the seabed. Fecal 
matter accounts for 3% of total dry matter in moist 
pellets (Uede and Takeuchi, 2007) to 27% of total 
dry matter in dry pellets (Wakayama Research 
Center of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 2002). 
The proportion of waste feed is variable, accounting 
for 3% of total dry matter in moist pellets 
(Wakayama Research Center of Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries, 2002) to 72% of total dry matter in 
moist pellets (Watanabe, 1991).  
 
Organic enrichment of the seabed, deoxygenation of 
the bottom water and occurrence of sulfides are the 
most significant impacts of fish farming on the 
benthic environment.  In intensive fish farming sites 
in basins, indices of organic matter loadings 
(chemical oxygen demand (COD), ignition loss (IL), 
total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), 
carbohydrates and amino acid contents in the surface 
layer of the sediment) become extremely high. 
Increasing organic enrichment of the sediment has 
occurred in various fish farming areas in the 
southwestern part of Japan.  Acid volatile sulfide 
(AVS) in the sediment is commonly used in Japan as 
an indicator of environmental deterioration in areas 
Section 1  Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   11 
with fish farms (Pawar et al., 2001; Yokoyama et al., 
2002a,b, 2004; Uede, 2008).  Fish farming changes 
the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of the 
sediment due to differences in the ratios between 
natural sediment and aquaculture-derived organic 
matter.  The stable isotope ratios can be a useful 
indicator to quantify organic wastes from fish farms 
in the sediment (Yokoyama et al., 2006). 
Biological changes   
Fish farming affects the benthic animals beneath the 
farming facility (Yokoyama, 2010).  Kagawa (1983) 
reported a rapid increase in the ratio of polychaetes 
in total macrofaunal abundance during the first year 
at a newly developed yellowtail farm.  He also found 
abnormal dynamics of the benthic communities, 
including defaunation in summer and recolonization 
of the azoic areas from autumn to spring, 
replacement of molluscs by polychaetes, and a 
decrease of total macrofaunal biomass.  Sasaki and 
Oshino (2004) found an aggregative occurrence of 
polychaetes beneath coho salmon culture cages.  
 
Fish farming also affects the microbiota on the 
seafloor of the farming area.  Takekawa et al. (1989) 
found the occurrence of the sulphur bacteria 
Beggiatoa spp. on the seabed within a radius of 20 m 
from coho salmon cages.  Rajendran et al. (1999) 
observed increased levels of microbial biomass and 
increased proportions of the microbial group, 
including sulfate-reducing bacteria.  Sakami et al. 
(2003) found large bacterial production at a fish farm 
site, suggesting that the loaded organic matter 
enhanced the bacterial productivity. 
Far-field effects  
Chemical changes  
Dispersion of wastes from fish farms depends on 
physical factors (current velocity, water depth, 
resuspension) and aquaculture factors (culture 
species, amount of feed and type of feed).  Many 
studies reported that the dispersion of organic matter 
from fish farms is limited to within 50 m from fish 
cages and that the effects on biotic and abiotic 
factors have been rarely found to extend more than 
250 m from cages.  However, Yokoyama et al. 
(2006) reported that the spatial extent of waste 
dispersal extended to 300 m from fish cages in an 
intensive farming site of red sea bream.  They also 
reported that enrichment effects on the bottom water 
and sediment chemistry (low dissolved oxygen 
content, high level of AVS) extended to a much 
larger area than the waste dispersal area. 
Biological changes   
Noticeable effects of fish farming on the benthic 
fauna are limited to within 50 m from fish cages and 
there is almost no change of the fauna 120 to 250 m 
away from the cages (Yokoyama, 2005). 
 
Harmful algal blooms often occur around the fish 
farming area due to organic matter loading from fish 
cages.  Since the 1970s, the incidence of harmful 
algal blooms has increased around fish farm areas, 
especially in the Seto Inland Sea, often resulting in 
mass mortality of cultured fish (Watanabe, 1991; 
Imai et al., 2006). 
Rates of recovery  
Benthic recovery rates vary, depending on water 
temperature and hydrodynamic conditions within the 
farming area.  There are few studies on the recovery 
in Japan, but Sasaki et al. (2002) reported that COD, 
IL and sulfide content in the sediment decreased 
rapidly in 6 months and the levels reached 50% in a 
year after destocking of cultured coho salmon. They 
also reported that the benthic animal community 
structure changed 1.5 years after the destocking.  In a 
fish farm site of yellowtail and red sea bream in 
Shitaba Bay, AVS in the sediment began to decrease 
2 years after removal of cages and reached a low 
level 5 years after the removal (Wakayama Research 
Center et al., 2008). 
 
1.3.3 Shellfish Culture 
In Japan, oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and scallop 
(Patinopecten yessoensis) are the major species of 
shellfish culture, accounting for 99% of annual 
production volume of shellfish culture in 2009.  Pearl 
oyster (Pinctada fucata martensii) is also an 
important culture species, constituting 12% of 
shellfish culture production in 2009. 
 
Shellfish culture has far less impact on the 
environment than feeding aquaculture such as fish 
farms.  Yokoyama (2002) indicated that pearl oyster 
farming had less effect on the benthic fauna whereas 
fish farming had a large impact on the macrofauna. 
In contrast, shellfish culture systems could act as an 
Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture  Section 1 
12  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
efficient biological tool to harvest material from the 
coastal ecosystem to the land (Songsangjinda et al., 
1997).  Nevertheless, the cumulative impacts of 
shellfish culture on the environment may cause 
eutrophication, hypoxia and changes of benthic 
communities. 
Near-field effects  
Suspension culture 
 Physical changes   
Suspended shellfish culture enhances sedimentation 
due to deposition of feces on the seafloor beneath the 
farming facility.  Fluid resistance of the suspended 
culture facility reduces the current velocity affecting 
transport of the materials in the water around the 
culture area. 
 Chemical changes   
The primary effect of shellfish culture on the marine 
environment is enhanced sedimentation. Mori (1999) 
estimated ca. 20 metric tons dry weight of feces was 
produced per year per raft of oyster culture.  The fecal 
production varies depending on culture density 
(Yamamoto et al., 2009).  In the case of attached 
organisms on the farming facility, more fecal 
materials are accumulated on the benthic environment.  
Kusuki (1981) reported increases of COD, organic 
carbon, total nitrogen, total sulfide and phaeo-
pigments in the surface sediment in oyster culture sites 
in Hiroshima Bay.  Such increases of organic matter 
content in the sediments were reported in the oyster 
culture area of Matsushima Bay, Kesen-numa Bay, 
and Ago Bay. 
 Biological changes   
Shellfish culture affects the benthic animals beneath 
the farming facility.  In the suspended scallop culture 
area in Saroma Lagoon, the cumulative impact of the 
intensive scallop culture affected the polychaete 
community structure where the species number, 
density and species composition of the community 
were changed significantly (Sonoda et al., 2002). 
 
Cultured shellfish excrete high levels of ammonia, 
promoting increased productivity of organisms 
attached to the farming facilities.  Attached 
organisms may not only compete for food materials 
with cultured shellfish but increase biodeposition 
from the facility to the benthic environment. 
Production of the fouling organisms attached to 
hanging lines of scallop culture was estimated to be 
equal to the scallop production (Kurata et al., 1996). 
In the pearl oyster culture area, on-site cleaning of 
fouling organisms leads to an increase of organic 
matter loading which amounts to 50% of the total 
organic load of the area (Ueno et al., 2000). 
On-bottom culture 
 Physical, chemical and biological changes   
On-bottom culture exploits the sea area two 
dimensionally and has less production efficiency and 
less impact on the environment compared to 
suspension culture which exploits the sea area three 
dimensionally.  Although the impacts are less than for 
suspension culture, on-bottom culture may play a 
significant role on surrounding ecosystems by 
removing organic materials from the water column and 
enhancing biodeposition to the benthic environment. 
Far-field effects  
Suspension culture 
 Chemical changes   
Suspended oyster culture affects the cycle of 
materials in the coastal ecosystem.  Songsangjinda et 
al. (1997) quantified uptake of particulate materials 
from the water column and release of materials to the 
benthic environment by a raft of suspended oyster 
culture in Hiroshima Bay.  The amount of nitrogen 
harvested as an oyster product was equivalent to 10% 
of nitrogen loading in the northern part of Hiroshima 
Bay. The cumulative organic loading by intensive 
scallop culture in Saroma Lagoon causes bottom 
hypoxia, and eutrophication of water (Sonoda et al., 
2002).  Songsangjinda et al. (2000) suggested 
suspended oyster culture played a significant role in 
the nitrogen cycle in Hiroshima Bay.  Biodeposition 
by the oyster culture system contributed 36% to the 
natural sedimentation of the entire bay, playing a 
vital role in transferring nitrogen to the benthic 
ecosystem while the oyster culture system showed 
less significance in nutrient regeneration.  Mori 
(1999) suggested that intensive oyster culture 
accelerated eutrophication in Matsushima Bay. 
 
  
Section 1  Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   13 
On-bottom culture 
 Chemical and biological changes   
Although on-bottom culture has less impact on the 
environment than suspension culture, it may play a 
significant role on surrounding ecosystems.  On-
bottom shellfish culture recovers nutrient loading 
from the land.  Iyooka et al. (2008) estimated the 
reduction of total nitrogen and phosphorus by 
cultured oysters and oyster reefs in Ariake Bay.  The 
amount of recovery by short-neck clam (Ruditapes 
philippinarum) fisheries is estimated to be about a 
sixth of the total input of nitrate in Hamana Bay 
(Furuya, 2004). 
Rates of recovery  
No scientific information on the rate of recovery of 
shellfish culture environments in Japan was found. 
 
1.3.4 Marine Algae Culture 
Marine algae culture accounts for 38% of the volume 
of production and 20% of the value produced by 
aquaculture in Japan in 2009.  Nori (Porphyra 
yesoensis) is the major species of cultured marine 
algae in Japan, accounting for 75% of the annual 
production volume of marine algae culture. Sea 
mustard (Undaria pinnatifida) and Kombu (Laminaria 
spp.) are also important culture species, accounting for 
13% and 9% of the marine algae culture production, 
respectively. 
 
As marine algae absorb nutrients from seawater and 
reduce eutrophication, it is regarded that marine 
algae culture has positive effects on the surrounding 
environment.  However, it may also have a negative 
impact on the surrounding environment through 
fouling organisms attached with culture facilities. 
Near-field effects  
Physical, chemical and biological changes   
Fluid resistance of the culture facility reduces current 
velocity, affecting the circulation and transport 
pattern of resuspended sediment in Nori aquaculture 
areas (Yagi et al., 2004).  
 
Cultured Nori absorbs nutrients from seawater. 
Studies in other countries have investigated nutrient 
uptake of Porphyra in view of the bioremediation 
potential of eutrophic effluents (Kraemer et al., 
2004; Carmona et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2008).  In 
Japan, studies estimated nutrient uptake rates of 
Porphyra yezoensis (Baba and Miyazaki, 1983; 
Yamamoto, 1992).  
  
Farming facilities of algae culture support the growth 
of other attached organisms.  Algae culture facilities 
also provide habitat for spawning and growth of 
fishes, and increase fisheries productivity of coastal 
areas. 
Far-field effects  
Chemical changes   
Non-feeding aquaculture recovers loaded nutrients 
from the land.  Since there is no other industrial 
method of recovery, this function is very important 
in controlling nutrient cycling between land and 
coastal waters (Furuya, 2004).  Marine algae culture 
plays an important role in reducing eutrophication in 
coastal areas. In fish culture areas, recovering 
nutrients by marine algae culture results in increased 
fish culture productivity. 
Biological changes   
Liu et al. (2009) reported that Nori aquaculture along 
the coast caused the occurrence of green tides in 
Qingdao, China.  The thalli of Enteromorpha 
prolifera attached on the culture facilities are able to 
drift in the water following their removal during the 
aquaculture activity of Nori.  In Japan, however, 
there is no report suggesting any relationship 
between Nori culture and green tides.  
 
Marine algae also provide a nursery habitat for 
juvenile and young fish, thereby enhancing marine 
resources. 
 
1.3.5 Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture 
The use of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture has 
been proposed for improving mariculture environments.  
Requirements for available seaweed species in 
integrated multi-trophic aquaculture include: (1) high 
efficiency of nutrient removal, (2) high growth during 
the warm season, (3) high economic value, and (4) easy 
cultivation (Yokoyama and Ishihi, 2010).  Carmona et 
al. (2006) indicated that Porphyra appears to be an 
excellent choice for bioremediation of moderately 
Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture  Section 1 
14  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
eutrophic effluents, with the added benefit that tissue 
may be harvested for sale.  In Japan, the 
effectiveness of integrated aquaculture has been 
confirmed from experimental fish farms using Ulva 
(Hirata, 2002; Kitadai and Kadowaki, 2004b; Suzuki 
et al., 2004; Yokoyama and Ishihi, 2010), Laminaria 
(Kitadai and Kadowaki, 2003; Ohyama et al., 2005) 
and Undaria (Kitadai and Kadowaki, 2004a; Kimura 
et al., 2007) as biofilter species.  However, this 
system has not been adopted on a commercial basis 
due to the lack of financial reward for the farmer’s 
additional work to implement such measures 
(Yokoyama, 2010). 
 
1.3.6 Conclusions and Recommendations 
Marine aquaculture releases large amounts of organic 
wastes and nutrients into the environment.  Feeding 
aquaculture has an especially large impact while 
non-feeding aquaculture, such as shellfish and 
marine algae culture, has less impact.  As marine 
aquaculture is an essential industry in Japan, we 
should preserve the aquaculture industry by means of 
reducing the impacts and environmental footprint.  A 
practical way to ensure sustainable aquaculture 
production is to evaluate aquaculture environments 
objectively and conduct aquaculture within the range 
of assimilative capacity of surrounding environments 
(Yokoyama, 2010).  For this purpose, research and 
monitoring have been conducted in Japan to estimate 
the assimilative capacity of aquaculture grounds. 
Another practical way for sustainable production is 
the use of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture for 
recovering organic loadings.  Although there have 
been many experimental studies on integrated multi-
trophic aquaculture, this system has not been adopted 
on a commercial basis at present.  We hope multi-
trophic aquaculture will be adopted practically by 
farmers in the near future.

1.4 Republic of Korea 
 
1.4.1 Overview 
In Korea, seaweeds (laver, Porphyra tenera and sea 
mustard, Undaria pinnatifida) were the main 
cultured species from the 1960s to the 1970s.  The 
focus of the 1970s to the early 1980s was primarily 
on the development of shellfish (oyster, Crassostrea 
gigas and ark shell, Scapharca broughtonii) culture.  
In the late 1980s, finfish culture had grown rapidly, 
and recently, it has begun to develop into integrated 
multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) to reduce 
environmental pollution in Korea (Fig. 1.4.1). 
 
The production of marine aquaculture in Korea has 
increased 2.5 times in the last decade.  Production in 
2000 was 65 × 10
4
MT and it grew to 136 × 10
4
MT 
by 2010 (Fig. 1.4.2).  In 2012, aquaculture 
production reached 137 × 10
4
MT; the portion of 
finfish produced was 7.1%, shellfish was at 26%, and 
seaweed was at 65.5% (Fig. 1.4.3).  Regarding the 
monetary value of aquaculture production in 2010, 
finfish accounted for 53.6%, shellfish for 24.8% and 
seaweed was at 18.3% (Fig. 1.4.4).  Regional 
production comparisons show that the productivity in 
the southern sea of Korea is the highest at 91.9%, the 
eastern sea is at 1.7% and the western sea is at 6.4%. 
Thus the production in the southern sea is the largest 
in Korea (Fig. 1.4.5).

Olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), black

(Pagrus major) are the main cultured species in 
Korea (Figs. 1.4.6 and 1.4.7 and Table 1.4.1).  Since 
2005, a submerged net cage system in the country’s 
offshore side is being used to reduce the impacts 
(eutrophication of nearshore due to intensive 
culture), and also to develop new cultured species of 
high value like bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis).

Near-field effects 
 
Culture of finfish is mostly performed in land-based 
culture systems, cage culture systems and re-
circulation systems.  To culture fish, feed such as 
extruded pellets (EP), moist pellets (MP), and raw 
fish are used.  Organic matter (uneaten feed and 
feces) from fish culture farms that are released into 
the coastal waters have been considered to be one of 
the major factors disturbing the benthic ecosystem 
(Jung et al., 2002; Jung et al., 2007).  Organic matter 
causes eutrophication in culture farms, gathers on the 
bottom as sludge, and can cause hypoxia (Yoon et 
al., 2007).  Therefore, the southern coastal waters, 
where the largest aquaculture production in Korea 
can be found, frequently experiences harmful algal 
blooms (HABs) and as a result, there have been  
mass mortalities in the area.  In view of chemical 
effects, organic matter changes occur in the levels of 
oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), acid volatile 
sulfides (AVS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), 
concentration of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in the 
sediments beneath finfish farms and in the 
surrounding areas. ORP has the tendency to increase 
with horizontal distance from net cage farms.  AVS, 
COD values and concentrations of C and N represent 
an opposite tendency to ORP, decreasing farther 
from culture farms.  All values of ORP, AVS, COD, 
C and N are significantly different in areas 15–20 m 
away from the culture farms (Kwon et al., 2005).      
 
Food waste is the main source of solid depositions in 
marine cage fish farms. In order to minimize solid 
deposition, it is necessary to increase the efficiency 
of the food uptake.  Based on the results of several 
experiments, if the percentage of food waste is 
decreased to about 10%, then the solid depositions 
could decrease up to 50%.  In addition, it was 
reported that if farmers use EP as food instead of MP 
and fish trash, solid deposition could decrease by 
57%.  Also, several studies have reported that the 
cage facility to the licensed area ratio can be 
decreased to less than 5% to minimize sediment 
pollution (Kwon et al., 2005).  From a biological 
effects standpoint, the number of dominant species, 
abundance, and diversity of benthic macrofaunal 
communities change with the distance from the fish 
cages (Jung et al., 2002; Jung et al., 2007).  In 
regions that are highly enriched with organic 
materials, a zone is observed with low species 
diversity and density, dominated by the opportunistic 
polychaete Capitella capitata.  On the other hand, 
the regions farthest from the cage culture (over 30 m) 
are observed to have the highest number of species 
and a higher density level (Lee et al., 2004). 
Far-field effects  
The data acquired from benthic interaction with 
aquaculture activities in Korea is insufficient 
because of the limited time frame studied.  We are 
currently performing research on the development 
of culture technology for bluefin tuna such as 
seedling production, appropriate feed, facilities, 
reasonable sinking depth when HABs come in 
from the offshore areas, etc. (Shin et al., 2005; Ji 
et al., 2008; Cho and Hwang, 2010).

1.4.3 Shellfish Culture  
The main cultured species of shellfish in Korea are 
Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas), mussels (Mytilus 
edulis), Manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) and 
abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) (Table 1.4.2 and 
Fig. 1.4.8). The methods of shellfish culture used are 
hanging culture, net cage culture and on-bottom 
culture.  Shellfish culture has less effect on the 
benthic environment when compared to finfish 
cultures because no feed is added to the environment, 
but due to intensive cultures and repeated cultivation, 
shellfish cultures can initiate the deterioration of the 
benthic environment.  These changes (deterioration) 
lead to outbreaks of disease, and curtail the 
production of shellfish farms.

Fig. 1.4.8  Aquaculture production percentage of shellfish 
in Korea (in 2010). 
 
Near-field effects 
Cultured shellfish produce biodeposits in the form of 
feces and pseudofecal pellets that settle on the 
sediment. This organic waste and debris can 
accumulate in the sediment below shellfish cultures 
and potentially lead to organic enrichment and even 
eutrophication (Lim et al., 1992; Kang et al., 2002). 
Further, the cleaning of biofouling organisms from 
cultured shellfish may accumulate beneath the lease.  
This process leads to reduced oxygen content, 
increased nutrient loads (TOC (total organic carbon) 
and AVS) and alters the associated benthic macrofauna 
communities (Jelbart et al., 2011).  The phenomenon is 
more pronounced at farming stations in the inner bays 
(Yoon et al., 2009; Cho et al., 2010).  Changes in 
benthic macrofauna may include a decrease in 
population and lower species richness (Park and Yi, 
2002; Jeong and Cho, 2003; Lim et al., 2007).  
 
Cultured ark shells are harvested with a hooked 
dredge which is placed onto the sediment in 
springtime.  The activity stirs the upper and lower 
sediment layers and destroys productive benthic 
habitats.  Therefore, the spatial distribution of 
polychaetes may be closely related to the 
sedimentary disturbance produced during the 
selection of shells for harvesting in spring (Kang et 
al., 2002). 
 
Far-field effects  
There is little information on far-field effects and 
benthic interaction from aquaculture activities in 
Korea. 
 
1.4.4 Marine Algae Culture  
Sea mustard (Undaria pinnatifida), kelp (Laminaria 
japonica) and laver (Porphyra tenera) are the main 
cultured seaweeds in Korea (Table 1.4.3 and Fig. 
1.4.9). Originally, the aim of marine algae culture 
was to increase food production in Korea.  Now, its 
main purpose is to enlarge the feedstock production 
of bio-fuel and medical supplies (Imbs et al., 2009; 
Cabrita et al., 2010; Bae et al., 2011).  Marine algae 
are important as food sources, bioremediators, and 
habitat for marine organisms and are a major part of 
aquaculture in Korea.

Near-field effects 
Marine algae are known to act as a biofilter against 
nutrient-rich effluent in seaweed-based integrated 
aquaculture systems.  Kang et al. (2009) evaluated 
the bioremediation capacity of Porphyra yezoensis. 
They confirmed the potential role of P. yezoensis in 
removing around 43% of the ammonium from 
effluents.  Hernandez et al. (2002) and Jones et al. 
(2001) reported that Enteromorpha sp. and 
Gracilaria sp. have a NH
4
+ 
filtration efficiency of 
over 80%.  In the past, Porphyra sp. was the most 
popular species in Korea for reducing the risk of 
eutrophication but recently many experiments are 
evaluating Undaria sp. and Laminaria sp. in 
seaweed-based integrated aquaculture systems to 
remove or reduce mass nutrient sources.  
 
Higher productivity and structural components of 
seaweed beds increase habitat complexity and 
provide habitat for marine animals.  Therefore, to 
rehabilitate the impacted areas, artificial seeweed 
beds have been put into place.  Kim and Kwak 
(2009) reported the results of monitoring benthic 
communities on artificial seaweed beds and 
concluded that plantation of marine algae (Ecklonia 
stolonifera) has contributed to the restoration of 
habitats for benthic communities in impacted areas. 
Far-field effects 
There is little information on far-field effects and 
benthic interaction from aquaculture activities in 
Korea. 
 
1.4.5 Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture 
Before the introduction of the Integrated Multi-
Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) concept, polyculture 
was already explored in Korea.  The National 
Fisheries Research and Development Institute 
(NFRDI) of Korea had already set up guidelines for 
polyculture (Anon., 1994).  Examples include 
Porphyra tenera and short necked clams (Ruditapes 
philippinarum) or surf clams (Mactra veneriforms); 
Laminaria japonica and sea squirt (Halocynthia 
roretzi); Undaria pinnatifida or L. japonica and 
abalone (Haliotis discus hannai); and Hizikia 
fusiformis and abalone.  These polycultures were 
aimed at yielding high productivity in limited areas.  
In the 1990s, finfish and shrimp cultures increased 
dramatically.  During this period, a change in the 
concepts and strategies of integrated culture were 
required because of the effluents from these 
organisms.  Therefore, the IMTA concept of eco-
friendly aquaculture was introduced in the 2000s.  As 
an integral part of IMTA, deposit feeding sea 
cucumbers (Stichopus japonicus) were cultured 
along with finfish and shellfish to improve the 
sediment environment (Kang et al., 2003; Zhou et 
al., 2006; Slater and Jeffs, 2010). 
 
1.4.6 Conclusions 
Aquaculture is a very important industry in Korea.  
Aquaculture-related activities may generate significant 
nutrient loading of coastal waters that can lead to 
eutrophication.  Solutions to the problem of eutrophic 
effluent, addressing both ecological and economical 
issues, are the development of IMTA and offshore

in the aquaculture industry, we still face several 
challenges.  In the case of offshore culture, we need 
to investigate and develop the following: 
 Specialized offshore cages for the southern coast 
of Korea, and bottom-dwelling fish;  
 Super high-value candidate fish species for 
offshore aquaculture; 
 An automatic system of feeding, monitoring, 
swimming activity, etc.;  
 Sorting, thinning, net cleaning, and harvesting; 
 A better understanding of the dynamics of cultured 
species.   
 
In the case of IMTA, we need to establish guidelines 
for appropriate locations and species, and when an 
outbreak of disease occurs, a quarantine between 
cultured species will be needed.  We are also 
considering joining aquaculture and tourism, and are 
continuing to investigate the interactions and effects 
of culture with the environment (including the 
benthic environment).

1.5 Russia 
 
1.5.1 Overview 
At present, the volume of aquaculture products in 
Russia is comparatively small – about 115 thousand 
tons (value of 6.7 billion rubles), 101 and 105 
thousand tons of which, respectively, in 2002 and 
2006 represented freshwater fish farming.  
Aquaculture production is about 5% of Russia’s 
capture fishery.  The conditions for development of 
marine aquaculture exist in three of seven federal 
districts of Russia.  Most territory of Russia is located 
in zones not favorable for commercial cultivation of 
aquatic organisms, but there are areas where the 
development of marine aquaculture may be 
promising (Makoedov and Kozhemyako, 2005), such 
as the Far East. Seas in the northwest of Russia are 
also promising for the development of aquaculture of 
native cold-water fish.  In the Barents and White seas, 
the potential production capacity of fish farming could 
reach 5 thousand tons per year.  Coastal areas are 
promising for the cultivation of Atlantic salmon, 
codfish, flounder and others (Zhuravleva and 
Zenzerov, 1998; Larina and Zhuravleva, 2009). 
  
Regular studies of the environmental interaction of 
aquaculture have not yet been carried out in Russia. 
However, in the areas where mariculture is 
developed, certain assessments of the changes near 
experimental or commercial aquaculture facilities 
have been made. 
 
1.5.2 Fish Culture  
There is no commercial marine fish rearing in Russia 
although successful research in this area was carried 
out 30–40 years ago.  In the 1970s–80s, research on 
the breeding of salmon, both endemic species – 
Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, and Far Eastern species 
– humpback (pink) salmon Oncorhynchus gorbusha 
and coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, was 
developed in the European part of Russia (Anokhina, 
1997;  Krutova, 1981).  
 
In the Far East there are currently 46 salmon 
hatcheries that produced 700 million juveniles in 
2006, most of which (87.5%) came from Sakhalin 
(Anon., 2010).  
   
1.5.3 Shellfish Culture 
Shellfish culture began to develop in Russia in the 
1970s.  During this period, the first scientific 
research was carried out and experimental marine 
farms were established.  After a 10-year break in the 
1990s related to social reconstruction in Russia, the 
number of mariculture farms began to increase.  This 
was due, on the one hand, by increased demand for 
seafood and, on the other hand, by the considerable 
reduction of stocks of valuable species.  The first 
successes contributed to further growth in the 
number of mariculture farms and volumes of 
products obtained.  By 2009, the total annual 
production of mariculture in Primorye increased by a 
factor of 7; however, its volume remained less than 2 
thousand tons.  In the last 10 years (from 2001 
through 2010), all marketable products of 
mariculture reached 10 thousand tons.  The major 
share of this volume was represented by the scallop 
Mizuhopecten yessoensis followed by the mussel 
Mytilus trossulus and the Pacific oyster Crassostrea 
gigas. 
 
In the last 10 years, operations related to the 
restoration of stocks and commercial cultivation of 
the sea cucumber (trepang) have been carried out, 
and three hatcheries for producing juveniles were 
established.  Two of them are scientific-experimental 
hatcheries and one is an industrial hatchery with an 
output of about 10 million individuals.  Beginning in 
2005, hatchery-produced juveniles were grown on 
bottom plantations in marine farms.  In 2009, more 
than 4 tons of the marketable products were obtained 
while, in 2010, the volume of marketable trepang 
products reached about 15 tons. 
 
  
Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture  Section 1 
26  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
The carrying capacity of Peter the Great Bay (Sea of 
Japan) allows for expanding production of both 
bivalve mollusks and sea cucumbers.  According to 
our estimates, about 100 thousand tons of bivalve 
mollusks could be produced per year within the 
coastal zone of the Bay.  Since deep-water 
technologies are not used in the region so far, only 
the carrying capacity of the coastal zone to depths of 
20 m was taken into account in this calculation.  In 
order to produce 1,000 tons of marketable trepang 
products every year in Peter the Great Bay, up to 40 
million hatchery-produced juveniles a year would 
need to be released. 
Near- and far-field effects 
In Russia, different methodical approaches have been 
used to evaluate the interaction between aquaculture 
and the environment.  First of all, this is an evaluation 
of variations taking place in the pelagic and benthic 
ecosystems where the mariculture plantations are 
located.  The results of studies from different regions 
of Russia are presented as examples below. 
 
In the Sea of Japan (Peter the Great Bay), the 
cultivation of bivalve mollusks has been going on 
since the 1970s.  In Alekseev bight, a farm for 
cultivation of the scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensis 
operated for 10 years.  Over this period, the 
condition of the plankton and benthic communities 
was observed.  In plankton, an abrupt decrease in the 
amount and change in the species composition of 
invertebrate larvae was found.  The density of 
meroplankton in the bight was abnormally low 
during the years of the farm’s existence and the 
number of echinoderm larvae was greatly reduced (at 
least 100 times).  An increase in the quantity of 
larvae occurred only 2 years after the termination of 
the farm activity.  After the liquidation of plantations 
in the bight, the quantity of epibiont larvae also 
decreased, but there was a significant increase in the 
quantity of echinoderm larvae which are most 
sensitive to organic loading (Maslennikov et al., 
1994).  As a result of the ecological situation 
worsening in the bight during this period, a 
disturbance in the reproductive function was 
registered for two macrobenthic species – the sea 
urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius and scallop 
Mizuhopecten yessoensis (Vashchenko et al., 1993; 
Vaschenko et al., 1997).  Influenced by the 
aquaculture plantations of scallop cultivated within 
the water column, there was also a rise in the 
quantity of microorganisms in the surface ground 
layer and a reconstruction of the microbial community 
of bottom deposits which provided favorable 
conditions for the cultivation of the detritus feeding 
sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (Bregman, 
1994).  
 
In the Minonosok bight, carrying capacity calculations 
suggested that farmed areas should not exceed 4.5% of 
the bight water-surface area. However, scales of 
cultivation in the 1980s were more sizeable: the 
aquaculture facilities occupied about 20% of the water 
surface and the quantity of the mollusks cultivated 
was twice as large as the suggested values in some 
years.  Studies carried out 10 years after the 
establishment of plantations showed that in the bight 
an accumulation of mollusk biodeposits and reduction 
in the total number of benthic species took place 
(Gabayev et al., 1998). 
 
Within the Russian zone of the Black Sea, studies 
were carried out in benthic areas near mussel 
plantations (Pereladov, 1987; Pereladov and Britaev, 
1988).  Long-term observations showed that species 
composition of the benthos has changed 
considerably: near the mussel plantations an increase 
in mollusk and polychaete species was observed, 
which is typical for areas with increased content of 
organic wastes.  Yet, total biomass and benthos 
quantity did not change significantly.  Silting under 
the mussel facilities resulted in an increase in the 
abundance of polychaetes and a reduction in 
mollusks.  On one hand, a substitution of the native 
fauna occurred which is interpreted as a negative 
effect but, on the other hand, the food resources for 
commercially important fish has increased which 
could be viewed as prerequisites for increasing area 
productivity (Dushkina et al., 1998).   
 
Studies carried out near mussel plantations in the 
White Sea showed that a redistribution of organic 
substances took place in the pelagic and bottom areas 
in the immediate vicinity which, in turn, resulted in a 
change in community structure. Near the plantations, 
an abrupt reduction in the protein content was noted 
by Primakov et al. (2008) who attribute it to an 
increase in the relative share of bacteria present in 
the plankton.  Plantations did not, however, have a 
pronounced effect on the quantity and biomass of 
zooplankton.  An irregular distribution of deposits to 
the bottom across the area resulted in increases in the 
organic load and, in some cases, resulted in a 
degradation of the benthic communities (Primakov et 
al., 2008).  
Section 1  Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   27 
In recent years, a quantitative assessment of the 
degree of organic pollution based on the value of the 
ground oxidation-reduction potential (Eh), reflecting 
the activities of chemical and biological oxidation, 
has been used.  Variation of this index within the 
sediments suggests a change in the oxidizing 
conditions and availability of free oxygen. 
Observations made in sections under mussel 
plantations in the White Sea showed that, in 
circumstances where the oxygen is depleted by 
oxidation of organic substances, incoming deposits 
do not have time to be fully mineralized under low 
oxygen conditions.  As the concentration of the 
organic matter in the sediment increases, changes in 
the benthic communities occur and several dominant 
species have been replaced by new ones (Primakov 
et al., 2008).  
 
In the eastern part of the Black Sea, an ecological 
assessment was used to determine the effect of a fish 
hatchery on the environment.  Based on long-term 
field oceanographic observations, natural factors 
determining the delivery of organic matter and the 
intensity of its biogeochemical transformation, the 
condition of accumulated deposits, and water 
aeration on the coast within the Russian zone were 
described (Fashchuk et al., 2007).    
 
Further research on the characteristics determining 
the degree of organic loading and examination of 
biological carrying capacities is needed for efficient 
control of bivalve mollusk aquaculture.  To this end, 
the structural and functional characteristics of 
plankton and benthos communities around 
mariculture farms and beyond their boundaries are 
now being studied.

1.6 United States of America 
 
1.6.1 Overview 
Commercial marine aquaculture on the west coast of 
the United States currently consists of estuarine culture 
of shellfish (mostly oysters, hardshell clams, geoducks, 
and mussels), net pen culture of finfish (mostly 
salmonids), and land-based aquaculture of abalone, 
marine algae, several species of finfish and larval 
shellfish.  To date, commercial marine finfish culture 
has been almost entirely carried out in open water net 
pens that are anchored in protected nearshore waters 
(primarily Puget Sound and the Columbia River in 
Washington State, but there are small operations for 
several species in Hawaii and experimental operations 
for white sea bass in California).  Shellfish culture 
includes off-bottom raft culture of oysters and mussels, 
particularly in deeper estuarine water, long-line oyster 
culture, and on-bottom oyster, clam and geoduck 
aquaculture in intertidal areas, including the use of 
predator netting and/or bags.  Integrated multi-trophic 
marine aquaculture appears to hold promise, but is only 
now being experimented with and has not yet been 
practiced at a commercial scale along the U.S. west 
coast (Rensel et al., 2011).  Similarly, while the 
aquaculture industry is poised to take advantage of very 
productive offshore coastal waters, there has been 
limited interest, and that industry is in its infancy on the 
west coast of the United States (Cheney et al., 2010).  
 
Environmental interactions between marine aquaculture 
and the environment are actively being studied by 
academic and government scientists in the United 
States.  Several recent reviews outline the existing state 
of knowledge for shellfish aquaculture (Dumbauld et 
al., 2009; NRC, 2010) and a review of the effects and 
risk analysis for salmon aquaculture was completed by 
Nash (2003, 2005).  The brief analysis below is largely 
taken from these reviews. 
 
1.6.2 Fish Culture 
The primary finfish species under culture along the 
U.S. west coast is Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) 
which have been reared in net pens in Washington 
State since the mid-1970s when stocks from Maine 
were brought to the NOAA Manchester Aquaculture 
Laboratory in Puget Sound for stock conservation 
rearing purposes.  Commercial rearing of Atlantic 
salmon commenced in the 1980s in both Maine and 
Washington State.  In 2011 there were 26 finfish 
leases in Maine and eight in Washington State.  The 
finfish net pen industry is approximately an order of 
magnitude (10×) smaller than that in Canada (Amos 
and Appleby, 1999).  Although the extent of the 
changes are always site dependent, the environ-
mental effects of U.S. net pen aquaculture facilities 
are generally equivalent to those that occur in very 
similar environments in British Columbia where 
much of the research has been conducted. 
Near-field effects  
The environmental effects of marine fish culture on 
the west coast of the United States have been 
examined and a risk assessment document compiled 
(Nash et al., 2005).  The extent of near-field effects 
depends on the density and size of the fish being 
raised, the quantity of feed being used, management 
practices like cleaning the nets, and perhaps most 
importantly, the characteristics of the culture site. 
Both Washington State and Maine have minimum 
net pen site flow and depth requirements and other 
aquatic bedland standards dealing with allowable 
practices, avoidance of special habitats, and related 
considerations.  Models like DEPOMOD were 
initially developed and used to predict organic matter 
deposition, given the appropriate site conditions, and 
used to develop performance measures (Cromey et 
al., 2002).  While these models were reasonably 
accurate for simulating bottom effects in slow 
velocity current conditions, they did not accurately 
predict organic waste distribution and assimilation at 
sites where currents were stronger and where solid 
waste particles that settled to the bottom were re-
suspended (Chamberlain and Stucchi, 2007).   
 
Subsequently, a model with user-selectable 
parameters such as separate feed or fecal settling 
rates and an adjustable resuspension routine was 
Section 1  Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   29 
developed for both benthic (sediment organic carbon, 
sulfide, oxygen) and water column effects 
(ammonia/urea nitrogen, phytoplankton, zooplankton 
and dissolved oxygen) and applied to both near- and 
far-field applications (Rensel et al., 2006; Rensel et 
al., 2007; Kiefer et al., 2011; O’Brien et al., 2011).  
This model runs within a unique three-dimensional 
geographical information system (GIS) to allow the 
user to visualize effects that occur in time and space 
over the GIS domain.  The model uses local (current 
meter) information or can couple to regional ocean 
models to simulate effects over large distances and 
multiple farms (discussed below).  
Physical changes  
Aquaculture net pen structures alter water column 
flow immediately around the pens by diverting some 
of the flow.  Deposition of feces and unconsumed 
food may change the physical characteristics of the 
benthos, but usually only in soft bottom areas that 
have weak current flows where sediment grain size 
may become further dominated by fine particles.  If 
the bottom previously consists of large grain size or 
rocky substrate, indicating an erosional substrate and 
strong currents, net pens are unlikely to cause 
physical changes in the sea bottom near or remote 
from the pens.  Though marine net pen farms in the 
United States were often initially located in poorly 
flushed bays and backwaters, they have now been 
removed from such areas or relocated to more suitable 
channel areas known to be less nutrient sensitive due 
to problems with naturally-occurring harmful algal 
blooms and promulgation of regulations limiting fish 
farm size in such backwaters. 
Chemical changes  
Finfish waste and excess food result in nutrients 
being added to the water column and benthos 
(Pearson and Rosenberg, 1978; Brooks and Mahnken 
2003a; Brooks et al., 2003).  Significant measurable 
increases in dissolved nitrogen at Atlantic salmon 
farms and areas more than a few tens of meters 
downstream of net pen areas have only infrequently 
been observed in the U.S. Pacific Northwest (Rensel, 
1989; WDF, 1990).  As a result of 10 years of 
monitoring and a trend to site farms in less nutrient 
sensitive areas, the water column nutrient 
requirement was removed from net pen permits in 
Washington State (Rensel, 2001; Brooks and 
Mahnken, 2003a).  In poorly flushed areas, the water 
column dissolved oxygen concentration could also be 
reduced, but this rarely occurred at U.S. salmon 
farms except due to natural conditions associated 
with the upwelling of nutrient-rich water or winds 
bringing deep anoxic water to the surface in fjords.  
Chlorophyll content in the water was not affected by 
fish farms in Puget Sound because nutrients are 
naturally replete and generally do not limit 
phytoplankton growth there, and phytoplankton 
growth rate is slower than flushing time (Rensel 
Associates and PTI Environmental Services, 1991).  
Reviews of the industry in British Columbia and 
elsewhere suggest that only about 3% of dry feed is 
lost to the environment and that fish feces contribute 
much more substantially to total volatile solids (TVS, 
4 kg m
–2
y
–1
) which, in turn, are directly related to 
increased sulfides and low dissolved oxygen in the 
sediments.  The magnitude of the change in all of 
these parameters, as well as remediation or recovery 
after fallowing, has been associated with water depth 
and current speed at the farm site (Brooks et al., 
2003; Brooks et al., 2004).  Zinc, an essential 
vertebrate nutrient added to fish food, and copper, 
which is used in anti-fouling treatment on nets, have 
been shown to enhance the concentration of these 
metals in the sediments, but their bioavailability is 
reduced to low levels by sulfides in the sediment 
(Brooks and Mahnken, 2003b).  The form of zinc 
added to feed is now zinc sulphate which has also 
reduced buildup in the sediments. 
Biological changes   
When they occur, chemical and physical changes to 
the sediments described above cause changes to the 
benthic infauna community that have been well 
characterized for any kind of organic enrichment to 
soft sediment communities (Pearson and Rosenberg, 
1978).  These include reduced species diversity, a 
change in trophic structure from a mix of benthic 
filter and deposit feeders to dominance by deposit 
feeders, changes in species composition to those that 
tolerate disturbance, sulfides and low oxygen (e.g., 
opportunistic polychaetes like Capitella and 
Schistomeringos, and Ophrytrocha), and finally a 
shift towards anaerobic microbial communities  
(Desulfovibrio and Beggiatoa spp. mats).  Since the 
amount of deposition and chemical changes depend 
on net pen site location, size and fish farming 
practices, these community changes also depend on 
these parameters and some sites do not conform to 
the usual pattern (Brooks et al., 2003; Brooks et al., 
2004). 
Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture  Section 1 
30  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
Other potential biological effects of finfish culture 
that have been of concern include the transfer of fish 
disease organisms and biological interactions of 
escaped fish with wild populations and other 
wildlife.  Concerns over disease transfer include 
either introducing a new disease to the system or 
enhancing disease transfer by placing fish in dense 
culture.  Despite periodic reports of diseases 
associated with introduced fish elsewhere, and 
historically common introductions into U.S. waters, 
no new Atlantic salmon stocks or eggs have been 
legally moved into Washington State waters since 
1991 and similar regulations prevent transfer 
elsewhere.  It has also been shown that the level of 
most pathogens in water within a few meters of net 
pens is not enough to enable disease transmission 
from caged fish to those outside the pens.  
 
Parasitic copepods or sea lice are one possible 
exception that have been studied in some detail.  
These crustaceans have free living planktonic larval 
stages that can infect nearby hosts and are present on 
both cultured Atlantic salmon and native Pacific 
salmon.  They have caused problems for farmed fish 
in British Columbia in the past, but that was prior to 
proactive management which involves monitoring, 
treatment, if necessary, when thresholds of infection 
are breached, and a number of best management 
practices to reduce the risk.  There is an extensive 
debate over whether sea lice from fish farms in 
British Columbia infect wild fish, especially 
migrating juvenile pink and sockeye salmon.  Some 
authors have constructed population models 
forecasting salmon extinction in British Columbia 
within four generations (Krkosek et al., 2009). 
However, some of the largest runs in history 
occurred subsequent to these forecasts.  Sea lice 
abundance on juvenile wild salmon and herring is 
higher in areas with active farms than areas without 
salmon farms (i.e., the southern Strait of Georgia,  
Morton et al., 2011; Saksida et al., 2011).  Reduced 
salinity of seawater may explain the low prevalence 
of sea lice in Washington State farm-reared salmon, 
where there are only eight active and widely 
separated farms.  Salmon have been reared in 
experimental and commercial cages in Puget Sound 
and Juan de Fuca Strait for over 40 years with no 
observed sea lice outbreak that required treatment 
using thresholds established in British Columbia.  
Most juvenile wild salmon outmigrate during mid-
spring to early summer when salinity is reduced due 
to annual peaks in river discharge, a fact that further 
reduces risk in Puget Sound.  Sea lice infestations 
can be treated with a parasiticide which decreases the 
infection level on farms and in wild fish and there 
has been considerable debate as to their effects on 
wild salmon (Brooks and Jones 2008; Brooks, 2009; 
Krkosek et al., 2009; Marty et al., 2010).   
 
A very small percentage of farmed Atlantic salmon has 
escaped over the lifetime of culture operations on the 
U.S. west coast, but it has been shown that there is little 
risk of several potential interactions with native species 
in the local ecosystem including (1) hybridization with 
Pacific salmon, (2) colonization of salmon habitat,  
(3) competition for food and (4) predation on other 
native species (Nash 2003; Waknitz et al., 2003). 
Far-field effects  
The extent of far-field effects of finfish culture is 
directly related to the size of the operation, the 
physical and hydrographic characteristics of the 
culture site, and the ambient water quality conditions 
of the receiving waters.  Deposition of volatile 
organic solids from feed and feces to the bottom, and 
resulting changes in the benthic community, have 
been shown to extend up to 225 m from one 
particularly large net pen operated several decades 
ago (Weston 1990; Brooks and Mahnken 2003a). 
However, current regulations in Washington State 
and Maine prohibit any adverse effect more than 
30 m distant from commercial net pen perimeters.  
Thus benthic effects are only considered under the 
near-field category discussed above.  Water column 
effects of commercial fish net pen operations have 
been repeatedly measured in Maine (dissolved 
oxygen) and Washington State (dissolved oxygen 
and dissolved inorganic nitrogen).  Dissolved oxygen 
effects are routinely measurable immediately 
downstream of the net pens but are restricted to a 
minimal distance (i.e., < 30 m) and extent (i.e., 
0.2 mg/L depletion) relative to ambient waters 
(WDF, 1990, Normandeau and Associates and 
Battelle, 2003).  Dissolved nitrogen (from ammonia 
excretion) flux from fish farms was measured at 
salmon net pen sites in Washington State and found 
to be similar to laboratory measurements in most 
cases and insignificant ecologically, as all net pens 
are purposely located in areas with high background 
concentrations of nitrogen from natural oceanic 
upwelling with a low probability of effects on algae 
or harmful algae (Rensel Associates and PTI 
Environmental Services, 1991; Mackas and Harrison, 
1997; Anderson et al., 2008).  These effects are also 
considered near field due to the few numbers of fish 
Section 1  Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   31 
farms that are spatially separated.  If there were 
numerous fish farms in a relatively small area, 
cumulative effects could occur and constitute “far- 
field” changes that would have to be considered as a 
carrying capacity issue.  Carrying capacity for water 
column or benthic effects is generally not currently 
considered an issue in states with net pen aquaculture 
(Washington State, Maine and Hawaii) but simulation 
of multiple farms in an area with persistent onshore 
currents on the northwest coast of the island of Hawaii 
indicates the possibility of measurable nitrogen flux to 
coral reefs in the nearshore waters (O’Brien et al., 
2011).  This may or may not cause changes to the 
reefs but is an issue in oligotrophic and tropical waters 
worldwide. 
 
1.6.3 Shellfish Culture 
Oysters, and primarily the Pacific oyster 
(Crassostrea gigas), are by far the dominant shellfish 
produced along the west coast of the United States, 
with Washington State production exceeding that in 
all other states and often leading the United States in 
farmed product.  Clams, including the Manila clam 
(Venerupis phillipinarum), and the geoduck (Panopea 
generosa) are the second most valuable product with 
value of geoduck production from Washington State 
alone almost equaling that of other clams in all other 
coastal states due to its high market value. Mussels 
(Mytilus edulis and Mytilus galloprovincialis) are the 
third most valuable product.  Efforts to expand the 
shellfish culture industry are currently underway. 
Near-field effects  
The majority of research on the environmental 
interactions of shellfish aquaculture on the west coast 
of the United States has focused on oyster or clam 
aquaculture which is conducted directly on bottom or 
near bottom on suspended racks or longlines.  In the 
following, we divide the discussion between 
suspension culture and on-bottom culture and include 
rack and bag and longline culture of shellfish in the 
latter category. 
Suspension culture 
Research on the effects of suspended mussel culture 
has been conducted primarily on the Atlantic coast of 
the United States and Canada, with the exception of 
one research project in Puget Sound.  The only other 
significant suspended shellfish culture operations on 
the U.S. west coast are for oysters which are hung 
from rafts attached to pilings in some estuaries (e.g., 
Drakes Estero, California, and Yaquina Bay, Oregon). 
 Physical changes  
The addition of cultured bivalves creates structure by 
adding not only the suspended bivalves themselves 
(in socks or on strings or lantern nets), but also the 
pilings, docks, or rafts from which they are 
suspended.  These lead to the addition of habitat for 
organisms that are attracted to the structure and 
either settle and create their own structure (e.g., 
fouling organisms) or use it for shelter and/or food.  
Further, the addition of structure leads to reduced 
flow and enhanced deposition of sediments, feces 
and other material like cultured shellfish themselves, 
dead organisms and shells to the bottom below the 
structure.  Depending on the depth of the water 
column and/or height of the structure above the 
bottom, the culture system has the potential to shade 
the bottom which could impact submerged aquatic 
vegetation.  Studies on mussel rafts in Puget Sound 
suggested that flow decreased markedly at the 
surface within the rafts, but varied substantially with 
existing current speed and tidal direction just 
downstream (Brooks, 2006).  The reduced flow 
influenced phytoplankton density and mussel growth 
as well as deposition of sediment below the rafts.  
Some scouring, sandier sediments and loss of 
submerged aquatic vegetation was observed near the 
base of oyster racks in Drakes Estero, which occur 
over relatively shallow bottom (NRC, 2009).  The 
magnitude and spatial extent of these effects are site 
specific and depend on shellfish stocking density and 
especially on pre-existing tidal currents and other 
physical conditions. 
 Chemical changes   
The addition of bivalves to a system necessarily 
influences benthic pelagic coupling and the nutrient 
cycle in coastal systems.  Bivalves consume 
phytoplankton and excrete wastes, some of which are 
deposited to the sediments below the culture racks.  
Water column nitrate and ammonium levels were 
shown to increase near the center of mussel racks in 
Puget Sound, but declined rapidly away from the 
rafts (Brooks, 2006).  Feces and organic material 
deposited on the bottom increased the concentration 
of free sediment sulfides in the sediments below the 
racks, but these conditions declined exponentially 
away and down-current from the raft.  Similar to 
direct physical effects noted above, these changes 
Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture  Section 1 
32  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
were also influenced by existing hydrography and 
bathymetry, with significant effects only observed at 
a site with slower tidal flow.  No differences in 
sediment organic content were found beneath oyster 
racks versus areas outside of the oyster rack footprint 
in Drakes Estero, perhaps due to current flow or the 
significant contribution of eelgrass detritus to 
sediments in both locations (Harbin-Ireland, 2004). 
 Biological changes   
Suspended bivalve culture can directly affect the 
composition of the plankton community via water 
filtration.  Mussel rafts in Puget Sound significantly 
reduced the amount of seston within the water 
column.  Mussels fed extensively on diatoms which 
significantly reduced their concentration within the 
raft area, but dinoflagellate concentrations were less 
affected (Pacific Shellfish Institute, 2002).    
 
A diverse community of epibionts also develops on 
the rafts and suspended cultures that feeds and 
contributes to the processes already discussed and 
provides food for more mobile fish.  The biomass of 
this community represented up to 20% of that of the 
mussels in Puget Sound (Brooks, 2005) and 
consisted primarily of other bivalves, polychaetes, 
arthropods, cnidarians, and nematodes.  Some 
members of this fouling community may be 
introduced species like tunicates which not only have 
caused problems for the shellfish in some locations 
(Locke et al., 2009), but are also of concern to 
managers attempting to control their spread and keep 
them from altering native communities (e.g., the 
invasive tunicate Didemnum is present on oyster 
racks in Drakes Estero; Harbin-Ireland, 2004). 
 
Physical and chemical differences in the sediments 
below suspended aquaculture can lead to differences 
in the benthic community.  The abundance of one 
polychaete (Paraprionospio) and a clam (Macoma) 
were significantly reduced under a mussel culture 
site in Puget Sound, but no differences were 
observed in overall community diversity or richness.  
These differences would also be tied to the quantity 
of shellfish being raised and to the local conditions.  
Further, any deposition of fouling organisms or 
debris from the culture operation would be expected 
to enhance structure and change the bottom community.  
This has been documented in Canada (D’Amours et 
al., 2008; McKindsey et al., 2011), but not in the 
United States. 
On-bottom culture 
The majority of research on the effects of shellfish 
aquaculture conducted along the west coast of the 
United States has focused on intertidal culture of 
oysters and clams.  Oysters are grown utilizing a 
variety of methods including on-bottom culture, 
floating bags, rack and bag systems, longlines and 
trays.  In on-bottom culture, cultch with attached 
oysters is placed directly on the intertidal (generally 
< +0.6 m MLLW) and shallow subtidal sediment 
surface where it is left until the oysters reach market 
size, usually in 1 to 3 years, depending on location 
and temperature.  Oysters are harvested from on-
bottom culture by hand (picked into baskets and 
tubs) or with mechanical or suction dredges.  In 
longline culture, seeded cultch is strung on lines or 
ropes that are suspended from stakes or rails and 
harvest is usually by hand.  Cultchless oysters are 
often grown in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or 
poly-propylene mesh bags placed on the bottom, 
suspended off the bottom on racks, or placed in 
floating bags attached to longlines (Conte et al., 
1994).  
 
Farmed Manila clams are planted in a grow-out area 
or placed in mesh bags for grow-out (Toba et al., 
1992).  Several techniques are employed to enhance 
the ground for clam production. Growers sometimes 
add gravel or oyster shell (Toba et al., 1992; 
Thompson, 1995) which provides a substrate for the 
attachment of naturally settled clams and potentially 
makes feeding more difficult for some predators.  
Plastic or nylon netting of varying mesh is also often 
placed over clam beds to reduce predation. Manila 
clam aquaculture tends to occur higher (0.6–1.2 m 
MLLW) in the intertidal zone than does oyster 
culture.  Harvest of planted tideflats is generally with 
a hand operated rake to collect clams, which grow 
close to the surface, but some mechanized harvest 
methods have also been recently developed.  
 
Aquaculture techniques for the much larger geoduck 
clam (Panopea generosa) have been applied 
primarily to intertidal flats, and crop cycles are 
currently about 5–6 years since growth is fast during 
initial years and then slows.  Geoduck culture 
techniques continue to evolve with survival in the 
hatchery and grow-out phases being highly variable.  
To date, growers have mostly planted small hatchery 
produced clams (1 cm length) in tubes made by 
cutting 10–15 cm diameter PVC pipe into 30 cm 
long sections and partially embedding them in the 
 
Section 1  Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   33 
sediment to protect them from predation.  Several 
geoducks are added to each tube, and mesh is placed 
over the top to exclude crabs and predatory snails 
(Beattie, 1992).  This mesh may cover tubes 
individually or extend over a group of many tubes, 
anchored only at the edges.  The tubes are removed 
after 1–2 years and the geoducks continue to grow 
for several more years before reaching market size 
(15 cm shell length, approximately 1 kg whole 
weight).  Harvest methods involve loosening the 
sediment around each geoduck with low pressure but 
high volume seawater from a small pump and forced 
through narrow tubes into the sediment.  Geoducks 
then come to the surface and are harvested by hand. 
 Physical changes  
As with suspended culture, the addition of oysters 
creates structure by adding both the animals 
themselves and structures like racks and bags or PVC 
poles and longlines.  This changes the ecology of the 
area which, in most cases, would have been 
dominated by soft substrate and adds solid three- 
dimensional hard structure that attracts other 
organisms.  Further, the addition of structure and 
organisms can lead to reduced flow and enhanced 
deposition of sediments and bivalve fecal material.  
The magnitude and spatial extent of these effects are 
site specific and depend on shellfish stocking density 
and especially on pre-existing tidal currents and other 
physical conditions. Experimental manipulations of 
oysters have demonstrated that additions of oysters 
either on closely spaced longlines or at relatively 
high density on-bottom can lead to reduced grain size 
and higher nutrient content, but this is not always the 
case at commercial planting density (see Dumbauld 
et al., 2009 for review).  In some cases the racks and 
short poles on which the shellfish are grown can also 
lead to sediment erosion and larger grain size near 
the base of the structures (Everett et al., 1995; 
Rumrill and Poulton, 2004). 
 
As noted above, infaunal clams are often grown 
under netting or, in the case of geoducks, in tubes 
and these structures have also been shown to 
influence sediment properties by altering flow.  
Though little consistent change in grain size has been 
noted for the addition of predator netting alone, the 
clams have been shown to alter the organic carbon 
content and, more importantly, clam growers also 
directly alter the physical character of the sediments 
by adding gravel and crushed shell (Thompson, 1995). 
 Chemical changes 
The addition of bivalves to a system influences 
benthic pelagic coupling and nutrient cycling in 
coastal systems.  Bivalves consume phytoplankton 
and excrete wastes, some of which are deposited to 
the sediments, but these effects are not well explored 
for bottom culture of shellfish along the west coast of 
the United States.  Richardson et al. (2007) found no 
differences in sediment properties between areas 
with bottom oyster culture and those outside the 
beds.  Experimental additions of both oysters and 
geoducks have demonstrated enhanced porewater 
ammonium, and oysters, but not clams, affected 
sediment grain size and organic content compared to 
controls (Ruesink and Rowell, 2012; Wagner et al., 
in prep). 
 Biological changes   
Shellfish aquaculture provides structured benthic 
habitat, but also reduces or changes this structure in 
existing seagrass habitats.  This is relevant because 
seagrass is declining in many locations worldwide 
(Orth et al., 2006; Hughes et al., 2009; Waycott et 
al., 2009) and along with other vegetated habitats 
like salt marshes, usually serves as a benchmark for 
habitat comparisons.  Seagrass is protected in the 
United States due to its presumed value as essential 
fish habitat (under the Magnuson Stevens Act) or as 
habitat for other protected species (under the 
Endangered Species Act).  The addition of bivalve 
shellfish like oysters might be expected to simply 
replace seagrass habitat via space competition, but 
research on the U.S. west coast suggests that the 
tradeoff is not 1:1 and a threshold exists below which 
shoot density of eelgrass (Zostera marina) declined 
markedly after 1 year (1.3% oyster cover), 2 years 
(12.4%), and 3 years (21.9%; Wagner et al., in 
prep.).  Though nutrients in sediments and porewater 
were enhanced by the presence of oysters, eelgrass 
shoot size was reduced, but eelgrass growth rate was 
not, apparently because nutrients were not limiting in 
the estuary studied.  This response may clearly differ 
depending on existing conditions.  The influence of 
longline culture has also been examined with 
eelgrass being limited by light and potential shading 
as well as by dessication and stranding over the lines 
(Rumrill and Poulton, 2004). 
 
Shellfish harvest practices also directly influence 
eelgrass, with mechanical dredges directly removing 
plants, and this practice causes more eelgrass 
  
Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture  Section 1 
34  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
disturbance than longline culture or on-bottom 
harvest by hand picking (Tallis et al., 2009).  In all 
cases, total production of eelgrass was reduced in 
areas of oyster mariculture, but eelgrass recovery 
took place after 2 to 3 years.  Contrary to 
expectation, eelgrass seedling survival and growth 
was greater in dredge-harvested areas where more 
eelgrass had been removed and remaining shoots 
caused less shading (Wisehart et al., 2007).  
Ecosystem- or estuary-scale studies are necessary to 
define the overall impact but initial estimates from a 
portion of one estuary (Willapa Bay, Washington), 
where up to 20% of oysters harvested in the United 
States are produced, clearly depicted reductions of 
eelgrass cover on individual beds, suggesting that, on 
average, there was little difference in overall eelgrass 
cover inside and outside of oyster aquaculture areas 
(Dumbauld et al., 2009).  Seagrass is apparently 
expanding in this estuary, however, so existing 
conditions should always be considered.  
 
Most U.S. west coast clam aquaculture does not co-
occur with native seagrass, but recent work on 
intertidal geoduck clam aquaculture suggests that 
harvest disturbance to eelgrass is similar to that 
observed with oysters, with initial shoot density 
dropping by more than 70% and small gaps created  
in eelgrass beds which take over a year to recover.  
Geoducks are initially grown in plastic tubes and 
when planted in eelgrass (which is rarely the case), a 
reduction in eelgrass density and shoot length was 
observed.    
 
On-bottom shellfish aquaculture directly influences 
benthic infauna and epibenthic meiofauna via 
changes to the nutrient chemistry and grain size of 
the sediments, creation of hard substrate for 
settlement and/or protection of smaller organisms 
from predators, and via harvest practices which 
remove the shellfish and can also change the 
substrate.  The extent of these changes varies with 
species being cultured, culture practice and 
particularly with existing conditions.  Several studies 
have demonstrated that the benthic infaunal 
community in U.S. west coast estuaries is more 
diverse in oyster aquaculture than in open 
unstructured habitats and either comparable or 
slightly less diverse than that found in other 
structured habitats like eelgrass (Hosack et al., 2006; 
Ferraro and Cole, 2011).  Though clams do not 
directly structure the surface of the sediment, the 
presence of clams, culture practices like gravel and 
shell addition, the addition of predator netting, and 
harvest practices have also been shown to influence 
the benthic community (Thompson, 1995).  Fewer 
studies of epibenthic meiofauna have been conducted 
but they too, suggest taxa-specific results and a 
diverse community associated with structure like 
bivalve shells compared to open unstructured 
mudflat.   
 
Aquaculture has been a vector for the introduction of 
non-native species, including the cultured organisms 
themselves into estuarine systems (Carlton, 1992; 
Ruesink et al., 2006).  Potential negative environmental 
and economic consequences of such introductions 
resulted in the implementation of import and transport 
regulations at state, federal and international levels 
(such as the ICES codes of practice, ICES, 2005) that, 
along with best management practices in the United 
States, have greatly reduced these threats.  Although 
no new introductions of non-native bivalves have 
occurred recently, evidence suggests that previous 
introductions continue to have effects, e.g., Pacific 
oysters have naturalized and spread in some locations 
with attendant effects on native oysters and 
community (Trimble et al., 2009; Padilla, 2010), 
accidentally introduced oyster pests like oyster drills 
continue to impact both commercial aquaculture and 
native communities (Buhle and Ruesink, 2009), and 
fouling organisms expand their distribution on hard 
substrates provided by oysters and structures. 
 
Shellfish disease agents have also been transferred 
via movement of infected stocks and this has 
occurred on the west coast of the United States 
(Friedman et al., 1989; Friedman, 1996; Burge et al., 
2007).  Like other introduced species transfers, 
occurrences have been reduced with regulations and 
voluntary participation in the High Health Program, 
but there is potential for additional problems.  Other 
issues have surfaced, such as escape or natural 
spawning behavior of the shellfish being raised such 
that the genetic pool of wild stock is influenced by 
the captive animals (Camara and Vadopalas, 2009), 
but little research has been directed at these issues. 
 
Although more mobile fish and invertebrates have 
also been shown to associate with structured habitats 
like eelgrass and oyster aquaculture, the majority 
were less likely to do so than sedentary fauna in U.S. 
west coast estuaries (reviewed in Dumbauld et al., 
2009).  Nonetheless, on-bottom oyster aquaculture 
has been clearly associated with enhanced abundance 
of juvenile 0+ Dungeness crab as well as slightly 
larger rock crab (Dumbauld et al., 2000; Feldman et 
Section 1  Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   35 
al., 2000; Holsman et al., 2006).  Studies of other 
economically important species that utilize U.S. west 
coast estuaries as nursery areas are ongoing.  
 
Birds and marine mammals could also be affected by 
shellfish aquaculture activities with direct human 
disturbance of behavior and disturbance of food 
sources being the primary issues.  Virtually no 
studies document direct or indirect effects of 
disturbance on behavior (but see NRC (2009) for a 
review of potential impacts to seals in Drakes 
Estero).  Only a few studies have been conducted in 
U.S. estuaries, and they suggest that foraging 
behavior of some shorebirds can be negatively 
affected (deep probers) while other birds adapt to and 
feed in aquaculture plots (surface oriented feeders; 
Kelly et al., 1996; Connolly and Colwell, 2005).  
Waterfowl like black brant could also be affected if 
their primary food source (eelgrass) was in short 
supply and aquaculture was being conducted in that 
habitat, but no studies have examined whether food 
is a limiting factor at the estuarine ecosystem scale 
for birds or most other fish and invertebrates. 
Far-field effects  
Suspension culture 
Far-field effects of suspension culture depend on the 
specifics of the site (bathymetry, hydrography) and 
shellfish culture operation (raft size, density of 
organisms, placement of lines, etc.).  Some work had 
been done for mussel raft culture in South Puget 
Sound, which suggests that no effects on water column 
parameters could be observed beyond about 70 m 
away from mussel rafts.  No research on the landscape- 
scale effects of suspended culture operations has been 
completed on the U.S. west coast.  However, most of 
the physical, chemical and especially biological effects 
for mussels and oysters discussed above have been 
found to decrease rapidly just outside the site and 
disappear within several hundred meters. 
On-bottom culture 
Far-field effects of on-bottom culture have been little 
explored, but few direct effects have been observed 
beyond the boundary of the shellfish aquaculture 
operations themselves.  Understanding the role of 
shellfish aquaculture at the landscape scale where 
aquaculture is intermixed with other estuarine 
habitats and how this influences water properties and 
more mobile fish and invertebrates, however, is an 
important avenue for future research.  Some progress 
has been made in initial investigations at intermediate 
scales in Willapa Bay, Washington, where aquaculture 
is conducted on, and influences about, 20% of the 
intertidal estuarine area (Dumbauld et al., 2011).  
Effects of intertidal oyster culture on submerged 
aquatic vegetation can be assessed using infrared 
aerial photography, and a preliminary analysis for a 
small section of the estuary suggested that as much 
eelgrass occurred inside aquaculture as that in a buffer 
zone just outside and adjacent to it (Dumbauld et al., 
2009).  This represents a single snapshot and a more 
comprehensive approach is currently being used to 
quantify changes occurring over a longer temporal 
scale (the lifetime of a shellfish crop).  The ecosystem 
services provided by all estuarine habitats, including 
shellfish aquaculture, could then be evaluated at this 
larger scale and weighed against other anthropogenic 
changes made to these systems. 
 
1.6.4 Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture 
Integrated multi-trophic marine aquaculture (IMTA) 
appears to hold promise as a means to capture some 
particulate and dissolved wastes from fish 
aquaculture and obtain multiple products, but is only 
now being experimented with and has not yet been 
practiced at a commercial scale along the U.S. west 
coast (Rensel et al., 2011).  Results of an initial study 
showed that Pacific oysters but not mussels, 
suspended at depth below Atlantic salmon net pens, 
grew faster than those grown at the same depth 
outside of the farm footprint, but site was an 
important factor as well.  The benefit appeared to be 
due to consumption of fish feces by the shellfish 
based on stable isotope mixing analyses and although 
oysters are not likely to replace fish as the cash crop 
on these farms, the experiments highlighted the 
potential for further investigation and scaled up trials 
(Rensel et al., 2011).  IMTA appears to be a useful 
tool to limit adverse effects of fish aquaculture in net 
pens, particularly in areas less than optimal for large-
scale farms such as restricted bays where a large 
percentage of the nitrogen flux is due to aquaculture. 
 
1.6.5 Conclusions and Recommendations 
Marine shellfish aquaculture has been a very 
important human endeavor in coastal waters along 
the west coast of the United States for over a century.  
Marine fish culture is more recent, but Pacific 
Assessing Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture  Section 1 
36  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
salmon hatchery operations to supplement wild fish 
runs have been in operation for about the same 
length of time.  Research conducted to date and 
outlined above suggests that while there are 
recognized near-field impacts of current culture 
aquaculture at local spatial scales and over short time 
periods, the current activities appear to be 
sustainable.  Aquaculture is expanding dramatically 
on a global scale, however, and there is a recognized 
need and recent policy development that supports 
continued development of sustainable marine 
aquaculture in the United States (NOAA, 2007, 
2011).  While there are numerous regulatory and 
social management hurdles to overcome if aquaculture 
is to be expanded in estuarine and nearshore waters 
where it already occurs, continued research, 
particularly on the far-field effects of culture 
operations and cumulative impacts (both positive and 
negative) at the ecosystem scale, is necessary.  
Further, development of techniques like integrated 
multi-trophic aquaculture, best management practices 
to minimize negative impacts, and research on the 
potential for offshore aquaculture will also influence 
its success in the United States.

2 Marine Aquaculture Legislative Frameworks and Environmental 
Interactions Research in PICES Member Countries 
 
2.1 Overview  
 
Throughout the different PICES member countries, the legislative framework that governs marine aquaculture 
operations also influences the scope and focus of environmental interactions research.  Risk assessment 
approaches may be undertaken as part of the formal legislative process, or may not be specifically defined 
through either the legislative or regulatory mechanisms.  This section focuses on outlining the legislative 
frameworks specific to each member country, how risk assessment is integrated into this process, and the 
supporting research that is being undertaken to address questions related the environmental interactions with 
aquaculture. 
 
  
2.2 Canada 
 
In Canada, aquaculture is a relatively new industry 
that has expanded rapidly over the last two decades.  
The Government of Canada recognizes the 
significant benefits to society associated with 
aquaculture and has made sustainable aquaculture 
development a key priority. 
 
2.2.1 Legislative Framework for Risk 
Assessment of Aquaculture 
Within the federal government there are 17 
departments and agencies that have direct influence on 
aquaculture development, ranging from research and 
technology transfer, training and development, 
environmental sustainability, regulation, product 
safety and inspection, foreign market and trade 
services, and access to financing and communications. 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) is the lead 
federal department for the sustainable management 
of fisheries and aquaculture.   
 
With the exception of British Columbia and Prince 
Edward Island, provincial governments are generally 
responsible for issuing licenses and permits and 
regulating farm activities, including escapes, waste 
management, and those aquatic animal health aspects 
that are of provincial concern. 
 
DFO is responsible for administering, monitoring 
and enforcing compliance with regulations relating to 
conservation and protection, environment and habitat 
protection under the Fisheries Act and aquatic animal 
health under the Fish Health Protection Regulations.  
As of December 18, 2010, DFO assumed a greater 
role in the management of aquaculture activities in 
the province of British Columbia (see Figure 2.2.1), 
through the new Pacific Aquaculture Regulations. 
Under the Fisheries Act, the Pacific Aquaculture 
Regulations, and the Fishery (General) Regulations, 
DFO now governs certain activities regarding the 
cultivation of fish in British Columbia.  Specifically, 
finfish, shellfish and freshwater aquaculture operations 
 
Marine Aquaculture Legislative Frameworks  Section 2 
42  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
within the province will require a federal aquaculture 
license issued under the Fisheries Act, a federal 
Navigable Waters Protection Act permit and a 
provincial lease.  British Columbia remains a key 
player, issuing tenures where operations take place in 
the marine or freshwater environment, licensing 
marine plant cultivation, and managing business 
aspects of aquaculture such as workplace health and 
safety. 
 
On December 22, 2010, the Health of Animals 
Regulations were amended to specifically include 
aquatic animals.  The Health of Animals Act and 
Health of Animals Regulations regulate international 
trade in live animals, animal products and by-
products, animal feeds, veterinary biologics and 
biotechnology products.  In addition, they provide 
for the approval and registration of private 
quarantine premises and establishments involved in 
the importation of animals, animal products and 
veterinary biologics.  They also set standards of 
construction, operation and maintenance for these 
facilities and establishments.  The Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency (CFIA), the agency responsible 
for the Health of Animals Act, also amended the 
Reportable Diseases Regulations in January, 2011, to 
include 20 diseases that pose serious risks to aquatic 
animal health, international trade, and the economy.  
The CFIA is responsible for the administration and 
enforcement this Act.  These changes will be phased 
in over the next several years.  Eventually DFO 
expects to rescind the Fish Health Protection 
Regulations to avoid regulatory duplication and 
overlap with the Health of Animals Regulations.

Section 2  Marine Aquaculture Legislative Frameworks 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   43 
Under the Fisheries Act, Section 43 provides 
enabling authority for the Governor in Council to 
make regulations for the conservation and protection 
of fisheries resources, including the taking or 
carrying of fish or any part thereof from one 
province to any other province.  The authority to 
issue licenses permitting the release of live fish has 
been delegated to provincial ministers in only some 
provinces; the federal Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans retains this power in the other provinces and 
the territories.  The National Code on Introductions 
and Transfers (see http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/ 
science/enviro/ais-eae/code-eng.htm) establishes the 
principles and standards for the intentional 
introduction and/or transfer of aquatic organisms in 
order to protect these resources.  The Introductions 
and Transfers Committees are responsible for 
assessing proposals to move aquatic organisms from 
one water body to another.  The Code also provides 
all jurisdictions with a consistent process (the Risk 
Assessment procedure) for assessing the potential 
impacts of intentional introductions and transfers of 
aquatic organisms. 
 
In Canadian licensing of aquaculture, and in the 
review of aquaculture operations, there are risk 
analysis protocols for the protection of navigable 
waters and habitat alteration, for disease control, for 
protection against disruption or destruction, for 
introduction and transfer of aquatic organisms, and 
for hazardous substances.  For the purposes of risk 
analysis and assessment, the Government of Canada 
has adopted a definition of risk that aligns with the 
World Trade Organization’s definition.  Specifically, 
risk is defined as “the product of the severity of the 
predicted change and the probability that prediction 
is correct”.  Further, severity is defined as “the 
combination of the intensity of change, the 
geographic extent of change, and the duration of the 
change (including reversibility), and any time lag in 
the expression of the change”.   
 
For construction projects on or near water and for 
aquatic activities (e.g., fisheries or aquaculture 
operations), aquatic environmental risks must be 
analyzed in a sustainable ecosystem context.  
Various tools are being developed to support this 
analysis, including aquaculture-specific pathways of 
effects diagrams that have been recently validated 
through a scientific peer-review process (see the 
summarized science advice on the aquaculture 
pathways of effects diagrams at http://www.dfo-
mpo.gc.ca/CSAS/Csas/Publications/SAR-AS/2009/20 
09_071_e.pdf). 
 
For aquaculture activities, seven pathways of effects 
diagrams were developed for seven different stressor 
categories:  
1. physical alteration of habitat structure,  
2.  alteration in light,  
3.  noise,  
4.  release of chemicals and litter,  
5. release/removal of nutrients, non-cultured organisms, 
and other organic material,  
6.  release or removal of fish,   
7.  release of pathogens.   
These seven pathways provide a pictorial overview 
of aquaculture activity stressors (Figure 2.2.2; for 
example, releasing cultured organisms into the 
environment (i.e., escaped cultured fish) through 
equipment failure or accident and the potential 
effects that this activity may have on the receiving 
environment).  The state of scientific knowledge to 
support or refute each stressor–effect linkage has 
been analyzed, and knowledge gaps identified.  
These diagrams and the scientific review of the 
evidence to support them have been used to develop 
the scientific underpinning of aquaculture policies 
under the new Pacific Aquaculture Regulations, and 
were designed to foster a consistent environmental 
approach to the management of aquaculture in 
Canada.

2.2.2 Research to Support Sustainable 
Aquaculture 
Aquaculture regulatory research is undertaken 
primarily by DFO scientists who address priority 
regulatory knowledge gaps as identified by 
regulators and aquaculture management in the 
Department.  To date, research has focused primarily 
on fish health management issues (e.g., pathogen 
dispersal prediction models, fate and effect of sea 
lice treatments in the environment, developing bay 
management areas for new aquaculture sites, etc.) 
and addressing knowledge gaps for evaluating 
aquaculture siting questions (e.g., the fate of wastes 
on hard-bottom surfaces, oceanographic modelling of 
waste dispersal, bathymetry analysis in areas 
identified for new aquaculture sites).  Knowledge 
gaps identified in the process of scientifically 
evaluating the pathways of effects also help to guide 
the identification of research priorities.

2.3.1 Legislative Framework for Risk 
Assessment of Aquaculture  
Mariculture generates large amounts of nutrients and 
organic wastes, resulting in environmental deterioration 
in and around aquaculture facilities. In addition, 
mariculture has risks such as escapes of farmed marine 
animals and disease infections between farmed and 
wild marine species. Environmental impact assessment 
and risk assessment of aquaculture are to be important 
processes for conducting sustainable aquaculture in 
Japan. 
Legislation of the license for aquaculture  
The Fisheries Law is the principal law that regulates 
fishery activities.  It is administered by the Ministry 
of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), 
although many tasks are delegated to prefectural 
governments.  The Fisheries Law is the basis for 
granting licenses to Fisheries Cooperative 
Associations (FCA).  A jury organized of publicly 
elected committees and those selected by the 
prefectural governor examines an application for a 
license in which the type and duration of mariculture, 
and location and extent of the farm are described, 
and submits a report to the governor.  Based on the 
report, the governor decides whether the license 
should be granted (FAO, 2005).  In 1999, the Law to 
Ensure Sustainable Aquaculture Production (ESAP) 
was enacted.  This is the first law in Japan to 
specifically target aquaculture and is intended to 
reduce risks of aquatic animal diseases and to 
improve environmental conditions.  The Law 
requires individual FCAs to develop and implement 
Aquaculture Ground Improvement Programs 
(AGIPs) and submit the Programs to the prefectural 
government (Yokoyama et al., 2006a). 
Environmental assessment 
In Japan, the legislative framework was constructed 
fundamentally to protect fisheries and mariculture 
environments from sewage and industrial effluents 
(Yokoyama and Yamamoto, 2008).  There is no 
adequate legal framework for risk assessment 
processes for aquaculture.  Even the ESAP does not 
require an assessment of the environment before the 
commencement of aquaculture.  Therefore, for most 
of the fisheries grounds in Japan, there have been no 
cases of environmental impact assessments 
conducted prior to the establishment of aquaculture, 
and the scope of the ‘environmental assessment’ is 
focused on the monitoring of the environmental 
parameters and evaluation of the assimilative 
capacity.  Here, assimilative capacity is the ability of 
an area to maintain a ‘healthy’ environment and 
‘accommodate’ wastes (Fernandes et al., 2001). 
 
The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Law 
was enacted in 1997.  Although the Law does not 
directly refer to aquaculture, local governments set 
Ordinances on EIA following the Law and some of 
them include aquaculture activities.  In practice, 
however, no EIAs have been conducted for 
aquaculture. 
Environmental quality standards 
Within MAFF, the Fisheries Agency is responsible 
for preserving and managing marine biological 
resources and fishery production activities (FAO, 
2005).  The Fisheries Agency has recognized 
eutrophication as a serious threat to inshore fisheries, 
and requested the Japan Fisheries Resource 
Conservation Association (JFRCA) to devise 
Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) for inshore 
fishery grounds for environmental assessment.  In 
1983, JFRCA established EQS at coastal fisheries 
grounds (Table 2.3.1).  Ten years after EQS were 
established, the Basic Environmental Law (1993) 
was enacted requiring the government to establish 
EQS to be achieved and maintained in public waters 
to protect human health and conserve the living 
environment.  Although not specific to aquaculture, 
EQS take into consideration the potential health 
hazards associated with the intake of listed 
substances through drinking water and/or fish and 
shellfish. 
Marine Aquaculture Legislative Frameworks  Section 2 
46  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
The Law to Ensure Sustainable Aquaculture 
Production (1999) together with the Basic Guidelines 
to Ensure Sustainable Aquaculture Production (1999) 
set EQS, which are regulations designed to protect 
the environment of the water body and/or 
aquaculture organisms, based on three indicators:  
(1) dissolved oxygen (DO) content of water in fish 
cages, (2) acid volatile sulfide (AVS) content in the 
sediment, and (3) the occurrence of macrofauna 
under aquaculture facilities (Table 2.3.2).  The farm 
environments are identified as healthy when the 
values of these indicators are within the thresholds. 
At the same time, EQS for critical environments, 
which are used to signal that urgent countermeasures 
are necessary, have been identified.

2.3.2 Current Status of Research on 
Environmental Assessment of 
Aquaculture 
A practical way to implement ecosystem-based 
management of aquaculture is to evaluate aqua-
culture environments objectively and to conduct 
aquaculture within the range of assimilative capacity 
of surrounding waters.  Several research projects 
have been conducted to monitor aquaculture 
environments, to estimate the assimilative capacity 
of aquaculture grounds, and to develop models for 
environmental assessments.  These research projects 
were not adapted to formal environmental assess-
ment processes.  However, some of these have been 
referred to for developing the AGIPs under the 
ESAP. 
Finfish culture 
Research has been conducted in the following 
categories for assessing fish farm environments 
objectively in order to conduct fish farming within the 
assimilative capacity of surrounding environments. 
Macrobenthic community 
Quantitative analyses of macrobenthic communities 
in farming areas are available to validate the farming 
environments.  Macrofauna are sensitive to changes 
in organic inputs, and they have been often used as a 
sensitive indicator in environmental monitoring of 
fish farms in Japan.  A community negatively 
affected by fish farming is indicated by a reduction 
in species richness and/or species diversity, the 
appearance of dense populations of the opportunistic 
polychaete Capitella sp., which often results in the 
increase in total macrofaunal abundance, a decrease 
of large-sized species, and the disappearance of 
echinoderms.  
Indices for suitable siting of fish farms 
Studies have been conducted to develop guidelines 
for the suitable siting of fish farms and to determine 
the upper limit of fish production.  Two indices, ED 
(Embayment Degree) and ISL (Index of Suitable 
Location), were proposed based on macrofauna 
studies and chemical factors of the water and 
sediment (Yokoyama et al., 2002a,b, 2004). From 
these studies, threshold values of benthic 
components were derived to classify fish farm 
environments as healthy, cautionary, or critical 
(Table 2.3.3). 
Stable isotope analysis 
Stable isotope analyses have been used to estimate 
the flux and fate of fish feed in fish farms 
(Yokoyama et al., 2006b, 2009).  Waste feed and 
fecal matter in sediment trap materials and sediments 
can be quantified by using stable carbon and nitrogen 
isotope ratios.  Based on this technique, the spatial 
extent of waste dispersal was estimated in a fish 
farming area.  The optimum ration level was also 
assessed in a red sea bream farm to minimize waste 
feed.

Numerical modeling  
In Japan, many models are used to assess aquaculture 
environments and estimate the carrying capacity and 
assimilative capacity of aquaculture grounds.  The 
Fisheries Agency requested JFRCA to examine 
assessment methods for aquaculture environments in 
the 1970s.  In the examinations, JFRCA developed 
numerical models to simulate the aquaculture 
environments. Kishi et al. (1994, 1995, 2003) 
developed physical–biological coupled models for 
quantitative management of aquaculture.  Takeoka et 
al. (1988) analyzed material cycles and the oxygen 
budget in a yellowtail (amberjack) farming area by 
using a numerical model. Omori et al. (1994) 
proposed a concept of maximal benthic oxygen 
uptake rate to estimate the assimilative capacity of 
aquaculture grounds.  Based on the concept, Abo et 
al. (2006) were able to estimate the upper limit of 
organic matter loading in a fish farming area using a 
numerical model.  
Oyster culture 
Excessive culture density in terms of individual 
numbers per raft, which may lead to a shortage of 
natural phytoplankton feed for oysters, is a major 
problem.  The means of intensive culture in terms of 
raft number per area is also an issue because oyster 
feces may deteriorate the sediment quality.  Research 
has been conducted to estimate optimal production 
volume and culture density in order to achieve 
effective harvesting and environmental preservation. 
Numerical models have been developed to assess the 
oyster culture in Japan.  Kobayashi et al. (1997) 
developed a population dynamics model for the 
Japanese oyster, Crassostrea gigas, to investigate the 
effects of oyster density, the distribution of 
mariculture rafts, and cultivation practices on the 
growth and development of the oysters.  This model 
can provide a framework for predicting potential 
oyster yield from individual mariculture fields. In 
Hiroshima prefecture, an oyster culture model based 
on raft-scale cultivation was developed to estimate 
the most suitable culture density.  Recently, 
Yamamoto et al. (2009) developed a numerical 
model expressing physiological processes of the 
oyster and estimated the appropriate culture density 
under the environmental conditions of Hiroshima 
Bay.  As the culture density is not regulated in Japan, 
scientific results obtained from these studies can be a 
reliable source for local governments to provide to 
farmers as a guide on the appropriate density for 
sustainable oyster culture.  
 
In Ago Bay, where pearl oyster culture has been 
conducted intensively for more than 100 years, a 
project team that consists of the local government, 
universities and public and civil research institutes 
has been formed to develop methods for the 
environmental remediation of the aquaculture 
grounds.  The team has developed an automatic 
water quality measurement system and a numerical 
model to nowcast and predict the conditions.  
Anggara Kasih et al. (2008, 2009) also developed a 
model to assess sediment quality in the pearl oyster 
culture area in Ago Bay. 
Nori culture 
As seaweeds absorb nutrients from sea water and 
reduce eutrophication, it is regarded that seaweed 
culture has positive effects on the surrounding 
environment.  So far, we have not considered it 
necessary to do a risk assessment for Nori culture. 
On the other hand, it has been observed recently that 
Nori culture is suffering nutrient poverty in seawater.  
In addition to a decrease in nutrient load from the 
land by a system of Area-wide Total Pollution Load 
Control and competition for nutrients with diatoms, 
the Nori crop is decreasing significantly. Therefore, 
models have been developed to predict the 
occurrence of diatom blooms and to predict the 
nutrient conditions at Nori culture grounds.

2.4 Republic of Korea 
 
2.4.1 Legislative Framework for Risk 
Assessment of Aquaculture  
Korea has experienced a rapid increase in pollutant 
inputs from land-based sources into coastal waters, 
and high degradation of coastal habitats due to 
intensive coastal development since the 1970s. 
Population growth rates in some coastal cities were 
three times higher than the national average. 
Pollution loads in terms of biological oxygen 
demand (BOD) increased about 40% during the last 
decade, and coastal wetlands decreased 20% through 
reclamation projects.  Those land-based activities 
caused the deterioration of water quality, the increase 
in outbreaks of red tides, and the decrease of major 
spawning and nursery sites for marine living 
resources.  Not until the mid-1990s did marine 
environmental protection come on the public agenda. 
Large-scale red tide outbreaks and oil spills in the 
mid-1990s led the Korean government to establish 
strategic action plans and policies to address these 
issues.  Serious ecological and economic damage 
from these environmental disasters contributed to 
raising public awareness on marine ecosystem 
protection.  In 1995, the Korean government initiated 
the National Clean Water Action Plan to improve 
coastal water quality and to protect coastal 
environments from land-based activities.  The core of 
the Plan is the construction of sewage treatment 
plants in coastal areas. With the establishment of new 
ocean governance in 1996, the Korean government 
has provided a firm basis for systematic approaches to 
managing coastal resources and the marine ecosystem.  
 
The establishment of the National Comprehensive 
Plan was the first step in managing and protecting 
the marine environment and resources in a 
cooperative manner among relevant authorities.  It 
was the first strategic plan for marine environmental 
management and a budget was allocated for the 
expansion of publicly-owned pollutant treatment 
facilities. The Korean government has already 
established and implemented national initiative and 
action plans to protect the marine environment, even 
though there has not been a single integrated action 
plan for implementation.  
 
The Korean government started to reinforce policies 
for ecosystem and habitat protection in coastal areas in 
2006 through the enactment of the Law on the 
Conservation and Management of Marine 
Ecosystems, the amendment of Public Waters 
Reclamation Act and the Coastal Management Act, 
and through the strict application of environmental 
impact assessments on coastal utilization and 
development projects.  These actions are to prevent 
habitat degradation, loss of marine living resources, 
decreases in fisheries and to ensure sustainable 
development, based on a healthy marine environment, 
using an ecosystem-based management (EBM) 
approach (Fig. 2.4.1). 
 
The government’s goal is to protect and reconstruct 
coastal habitats, secure fishable and swimable 
environments, and ensure sustainable use of coastal 
resources, living and non-living.  Primary approaches 
to achieve the goals are through “Anti-degradation of 
the current environment and ecosystem condition” 
and through the “Improvement of deteriorated 
coastal environment”.  Objectives for attaining these 
goals are classified into the enhancement of ecosystem 
health, improvement of water and sediment 
environment qualities, and the strengthening of the 
legal and institutional bases (Fig. 2.4.2). 
 
EBM deals with a full range of land-based pollutants 
and activities. Setting a geographic boundary is 
required to effectively control land-based activities 
and enforce legal and institutional arrangements.

Boundary setting for EBM implementation is 
necessary for the effective allocation of resources 
and budgets and for the clarification of authority and 
roles of relevant entities. The geographic boundary 
covers both inland and sea areas (Fig. 2.4.3).  The 
sea area for implementation extends the Exclusive 
Economic Zone from the coastlines.  The land area 
covers everything from the high water mark of 
coastlines to the landward limit of coastal 
watersheds.  The geographic boundary of EBM is 
similar to that of the National Program of Action.  
 
EBM includes environmental (water quality and 
sediment quality) management measures, resources 
(living resources and space utilization) management 
measures, and institutional measures (human, 
organizational, and financial resources).  The EBM 
approach controls the pollution loads from land 
areas, and the activities causing alteration or 
degradation of habitats and the ecosystem.  The 
targets for pollutant inflow control into the marine 
environment include sewage, persistent organic 
pollutants, radioactive materials, heavy metals, 
oils/hydrocarbons, nutrients, and litter.  EBM covers 
the protection of:  coastal habitats, the coastline from 
mineral and sediment extraction and coastal 
reclamation, and tidal mudflats.

2.5.1 Legislative Framework for Risk 
Assessment of Aquaculture 
Aquaculture research and the commercial cultivation 
of marine species were widely developed in Russian 
seas in the 1970s and 1980s.  This was the first stage 
of mariculture formation as a new branch in Russian 
scientific and fish farming development. Russian 
marine aquaculture production amounted to 5–6 
thousand tons only, mainly due to Russian Far East 
kelp culture.  At the end of the 1990s practically all 
mariculture enterprises were closed due to economic 
reforms.  As such, reliable aquaculture statistics 
became unavailable.  As of 2005, mariculture has only 
been developed to a small degree by the domestic 
industry.  By some estimates, Russia occupies 14th 
place in algae cultivation (3 thousand tons) and 28th 
place in fish and invertebrate cultivation (68 thousand 
tons). There are 45 salmon hatcheries in Russia that, in 
2006, produced about 700 million newly hatched fish.  
As of 2005, only approximate estimates of mariculture 
development in the regions of Russia are available. 
 
Currently in Russia, fishery and aquaculture activities 
are under the jurisdiction of the Federal Agency for 
Fisheries (FAF). The territorial administrations of 
FAF are in each federal district. Management and all 
stakeholder activities are governed by the Fishery 
Law, and although an Aquaculture Law has been 
elaborated over the last few years, it has not yet been 
adopted.  Additionally, the Wildlife Protection Law 
and Veterinary Legislation are binding on farmers. 
 
The State standards and requests are issued through 
several ministries and agencies under the government 
of Russia (FAF, Ministry of Nature Protection, and 
others).  There are several law-making documents 
regulating environmental quality, habitat alteration 
and control for seafood safety.  The List of Maximal 
Permissible Concentrations for Fisheries Grounds 
and Federal Sanitary Norms and Rules are the 
primary legal documents.  In these documents the 
federal norms for toxic substances, heavy metals, 
organic pollutants and others have been established.
Mariculture activities in Russia, whether for 
enhancement or industrial fish farming purposes, are 
managed legislatively at a regional level, rather than 
at a national level.  Regional regulations related to 
mariculture are often grouped with fisheries 
regulations, and are specific to address regional 
priorities.  Thus, there is no over-arching legislative 
or regulatory framework for mariculture. According 
to all accounts this is the restrictive factor for 
mariculture activity in Russia. 
 
2.5.2 Research to Support Sustainable 
Aquaculture 
In the Far East, and North Sea and Black Sea basins, 
industrial rearing of high-value mariculture species 
such as mussels, scallops, sea cucumbers, mullets, 
Atlantic cod and others has been developed on an 
experimental basis.  Fifteen fish species and sub-
species that are included in the Red Data Book of the 
Russian Federation (2001) were artificially 
reproduced at aquaculture enterprises (FAO, 2005). 
 
Russia enjoys a large ocean shelf. However, about 
70% of it falls within the Arctic seas, and these zones 
are not favorable for commercial cultivation 
(Makoedov and Kozhemyako, 2005).  The main 
regions for mariculture research are located in the 
southern region of the Sea of Azov and Black Sea, in 
the northern region of the Barents and White seas, 
and in the Russian Far East.  Mussels, kelp, herring 
and salmon are cultivated in the White Sea region. 
Great progress has been achieved in the cultivation 
of mussels and oysters, and fish-pond cultivation of 
salmon, sturgeon and mullet in the Black Sea. 
Sturgeon cultivation was of great importance in Black 
Sea, Sea of Azov, and Caspian Sea. Biotechnologies 
of fish-pond and ranching cultivation of sturgeon have 
been developed in the Caspian Sea.  In the Russian Far 
East, bivalve biotechnologies for scallops, Pacific 
oysters, mussels, and sea cucumbers have been 
developed. Sea urchin and king crab biotechnologies 
are under way.  There are more thirty aquaculture

2.6.1 Legislative Framework for Risk 
Assessment of Aquaculture  
Although shellfish aquaculture has taken place along 
the west coast of the United States for at least 90 
years, marine aquaculture is a recent endeavor in the 
U.S. relative to some of the other PICES member 
countries.  As a result, no comprehensive federal 
framework for marine aquaculture was established 
and activities are covered under separate regulations 
administered by at least six federal agencies.  
Further, licensing and permitting requirements can 
vary by state within 3 miles of the coastline and 
individual states and local governments may have 
additional legal provisions.  Permits have usually 
been granted for individual activities and 
requirements are often not specific to aquaculture 
due to the precedence of other marine and coastal 
activities.  This has resulted in constraints and some 
conflicts over marine aquaculture development 
(Aspen Corporation, 1981; NRC, 1992; DeVoe, 
2000).  Nonetheless, activities currently result in 
federal action by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
(ACOE) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) which assert jurisdiction under the Rivers and 
Harbors Act and the Clean Water Act.  This, in turn, 
requires consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service (USFWS) and National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with their 
authority under the Endangered Species Act, 
Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, 
Coastal Zone Management Act, and Lacey Act.   
EPA also regulates discharges of wastewater from 
aquaculture facilities and the use of pesticides.  Other 
activities are regulated by USDA (U.S. Department 
of Agriculture) Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS) which has authority over vaccine 
approvals and animal movement permitting, 
including importation of invasive or potentially 
injurious species (Animal Health Protection Act), 
along with USFWS.  The Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) has authority over the use of 
drugs in aquaculture facilities (Federal Food, Drug 
and Cosmetic Act).  The National Aquaculture Act, 
designed to coordinate federal agency activities and 
promote aquaculture, was passed in 1980 and was 
most recently re-authorized in 2008.  The Joint 
Subcommittee on Aquaculture (JSA) composed of 
participants from federal agencies involved in 
aquaculture was created to serve as an interagency 
coordinating group and is currently developing a 
national research and development strategic plan for 
U.S. aquaculture.    
 
Within this broader regulatory environment, formal 
risk assessments for marine aquaculture activities are 
only infrequently conducted.  A recent example is a 
quantitative and qualitative risk analysis for 
infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) currently 
being conducted by USDA/APHIS as part of 
regulation development (USDA APHIS, 2002). Risk 
assessments that evaluate disease issues for both 
marine fish and shellfish aquaculture are only briefly 
mentioned here, but are considered separately under 
this Subcommittee’s final term of reference.  A set of 
guidelines for conducting ecological risk assessments 
for marine fish aquaculture based on a common 
analytical framework developed by the World Health 
Organization was proposed by Nash et al.  (2005), 
but risk assessments for aquaculture are still 
generally conducted through the permit process 
which varies from state to state and by federal 
agency.  Environmental effects are often considered 
in the process of developing an environmental 
impact statement (EIS) or environmental assessment 
(EA) for specific projects or for specific practices.  
Conducting an EIS or EA is in fulfillment of the 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  Some 
examples from the U.S. west coast are an EIS and 
supplemental EIS for applying the pesticide carbaryl 
for burrowing shrimp control in oyster aquaculture 
(WDOE and WDF, 1992), an EIS for adding gravel 
to shellfish aquaculture beds (Newman and Cooke, 
1988; Thompson, 1995), an EA for shellfish 
mariculture in Humboldt Bay, California (Jones and 
Stokes, 2004), and an EIS for salmon net pen culture 
(WDF, 1990).  Net pen discharge permits are 
updated and given public review every 5 years and 
are currently about to be revised the third time.  This 
Marine Aquaculture Legislative Frameworks  Section 2 
56  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
allows any new issues to be dealt with and may also 
be used to alter existing monitoring protocols to 
conform with new technology.  Permitting for 
shellfish aquaculture has most often taken place at 
the state or local jurisdictional level in the past, in 
part because these activities rarely crossed state lines, 
but also because shellfish aquaculture activities were 
in existence before most of the broader 
environmental protection laws listed above were 
enacted in the 1970s.  The ACOE issued a revised 
nationwide permit for all existing shellfish 
aquaculture activities in 2007 which required new 
reporting activities.  This allowed for regional 
conditions to be established by the states, and details 
remain under discussion for some U.S. west coast 
states.     
 
There are, however, limitations to aquaculture in the 
nearshore marine environment due to political, 
economic and environmental constraints.  With an 
expansion of the human population in coastal areas, 
space conflicts with other activities, and resource 
uses and conflicts with coastal residents over views 
from shorefront property and beach access have 
become pressing issues.  This has resulted in recent 
incentive and interest in evaluating  the potential for 
conducting aquaculture in offshore areas in the 
Exclusive Economic Zone and an Offshore 
Aquaculture Act was first proposed to the U.S. 
Congress in 2007 (NOAA, 2007).  While this 
legislation has not yet been enacted, and there is still 
no federal permitting process in place for these 
activities, several moderately successful trial 
operations have taken place (Langan, 2004; Cheney 
et al., 2010; Langan, 2010).  There continues to be 
great interest in offshore aquaculture and efforts to 
address regulatory issues such as actively pursuing 
marine spatial planning for offshore aquaculture and 
alternative energy development (Halpern et al., 2008; 
Foley et al., 2010). 
 
2.6.2 Current Status of Research on 
Environmental Assessment of 
Aquaculture 
Most ecological monitoring of existing aquaculture 
projects has focused on determining the extent of 
adverse impacts to the benthos since these are easiest 
to observe and measure.  Many aquaculture sites, 
especially floating net pens and suspended shellfish 
culture rafts, experience rapid and large temporal 
fluxes of ambient water quality conditions and fluxes 
in the presence of mobile pelagic and demersal 
species making it more practical to monitor 
physiochemical sediment characteristics such as 
sulfide or total organic carbon concentrations and 
benthic infauna species abundance and diversity.  
The latter are sessile and most likely to be adversely 
influenced by particulate organic enrichment beneath 
or near the aquaculture sites.  While there has been 
increased emphasis placed on evaluating ecosystem-
level effects and some of these have been researched 
and incorporated into guidelines and plans (NOAA, 
2007), they have not yet been put directly into 
practice in evaluating sites, and gaps remain in the 
ability to quantitatively do this (Soto et al., 2008).  
Shellfish  
Recent interest in the environmental effects of 
individual farming practices and heightened concerns 
regarding endangered species of salmon, sturgeon, 
and other species, particularly those that utilize 
estuaries along the U.S. west coast, has resulted in 
some significant recent research on the ecological 
role of shellfish aquaculture in the marine 
environment (reviewed in Dumbauld et al., 2009; 
NRC, 2010).  Bivalve shellfish influence the estuarine 
environment in three ways:  
1.  shellfish process food and produce organic 
wastes,  
2. shellfish and the materials on which they are 
anchored or held and cultured modify water flow 
and add structural habitat,  
3.  culture practices like planting and harvesting 
cause temporary pulsed disturbances to other 
organisms and their habitat.   
Most attention and studies have focused on the first 
concern.  Shellfish produce biodeposits that can 
reduce grain size and increase organic content of 
sediments underneath or within (for bottom culture) 
the culture site.  This, in turn, can transform the 
benthic community, usually dominated by 
suspension feeders, into a less diverse community 
dominated by opportunistic deposit feeders.  For 
bottom cultured shellfish, it is difficult to distinguish 
the effect of biodeposition from the effect of 
structure, and in U.S. west coast estuaries none of 
these extreme cases of enrichment have been 
documented.  Most studies have shown enhanced 
diversity in bottom cultured oyster habitat relative to 
that in open unstructured habitat (Hosack et al., 
2006; Ferraro and Cole, 2007).  The density of 
shellfish planted and the physical context of the 
environment into which they are placed are most 
Section 2  Marine Aquaculture Legislative Frameworks 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   57 
important and the only observable effects seen in the 
few studies conducted on suspended culture 
suggested that biodeposits are not as significant as 
those recorded for finfish culture and apparently 
dispersed offsite (Brooks, 2004; Harbin-Ireland, 
2004).  Local near-field effects of bivalves as filter 
feeders on phytoplankton have been documented in 
U.S. west coast systems, but models which have 
been widely developed to track effects at the 
estuarine system level (such as those discussed above 
for Japan), usually in the context of establishing a 
carrying capacity for aquaculture operations, have 
not been applied.  An exception is for ground 
cultured oysters in Willapa Bay, Washington, where 
recent research suggests that these shellfish, which 
have been cultured on a broad scale for about 100 
years in this estuary, can have such an effect by 
reducing growth of those oysters planted farther 
away from the estuary mouth (Banas et al., 2007; 
Wheat, 2010). 
 
From a regulatory standpoint, another important issue 
along the U.S. west coast continues to be the effect of 
shellfish aquaculture practices on estuarine habitat for 
other species.  Effects on habitat are evaluated against 
existing habitat and eelgrass (Zostera marina) is 
viewed as one of the most important forms of 
structured habitat, providing food and refuge for fish 
and invertebrates, including juvenile salmon.  Research 
to date suggests that disturbance to eelgrass due to 
shellfish aquaculture depends on the activity, but in 
most cases results in relatively short-term loss and 
recovery occurs within the timeframe of a grow-out 
cycle for bottom cultured oysters (Tallis et al., 2009).  
Structure provided by oysters appears to function 
similarly to eelgrass for small epifauna while use by 
larger fish and invertebrates depends on species and 
even life history stage (Dumbauld et al., 2009).  
Research on the effects of clam aquaculture, including 
that for the large infaunal geoduck clam, is underway 
(Straus et al., 2008; Ruesink and Rowell, 2012).  As 
for the effect of shellfish on nutrients and 
phytoplankton, spatial scale seems like a very 
important management consideration and research at 
this scale should contribute to more informed 
management and best management practices for 
shellfish aquaculture.  Disease interactions for 
shellfish mariculture have been significant (recent 
west coast examples include Denman Island disease, 
haplosporidiosis, hemic neoplasia, and larval hatchery 
mortalities associated with vibrios) and have been 
primarily regulated via quarantines and inspections 
with interstate agreements and transfer permits.  
Though an industry-sponsored high health program 
has been discussed, it has not been implemented.  The 
U.S. west coast shellfish aquaculture industry has 
actively supported most of the above research, and 
developed and continue to update its own environ-
mental policy, codes of practice and research plan 
(PCSGA, 2001; PSI, 2005). 
Finfish 
Research, risk assessment and management of the 
impacts of marine fish aquaculture along the west 
coast of the United States has focused on net pen 
culture of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in 
Washington State.  It is the only species currently 
commercially reared in that area.  Environmental 
risks of rearing Atlantic salmon, a non-native 
species, were quantitatively considered during a 
formal NOAA risk assessment expert workshop and 
resulting publication (Nash, 2003) that addressed all 
possible risks and assigned relative risk rankings.  In 
this work, the impact on the sediments beneath net 
pen farms from biodeposits, and the accumulation of 
heavy metals (zinc and copper from fish feed and net 
antifoulant, respectively), were considered to be the 
highest risks.  Numerous other risks were evaluated 
but either assigned low or very little to no risk (see 
Table 2.6.1).  
 
As with shellfish culture, concerns have been voiced 
about the impacts of increased nutrients from waste 
feed and feces to the benthos and dissolved nutrient 
wastes to the water column.  Unlike shellfish culture 
which, at least at harvest, represents a net removal of 
macronutrients from the culture area, fed culture of 
fish in pens results in a net production of wastes into 
the ecosystem that must be assimilated or buried by 
sedimentation. Dissolved wastes, typically of 
ammonia nitrogen and relatively small amounts of 
urea for salmon, are rapidly advected away from the 
farm site in water currents.  Ammonia nitrogen is 
rapidly converted to nitrate in any oxygenated 
aquatic environment by bacteria and can be utilized 
by phytoplankton if it remains in the photic zone or, 
if not, it is mixed into the deep layer.  As a 
conservative regulatory measure, net pens in 
Washington State have been restricted to non-
nutrient-sensitive marine areas (Rensel Associates 
and PTI Environmental Services, 1991) where the 
effects of discharge dissolved inorganic nitrogen or 
urea are unlikely to result in any additional 
phytoplankton biomass, either beneficial or harmful 
(SAIC, 1996; Anderson et al., 2008).

The Washington State Department of Natural 
Resources adopted Interim Guidelines for Manage-
ment of net pen culture  that were promulgated in 
1986  (SAIC, 1986) as legal requirements for their 
aquatic lands leases in the 1980s.  Over time, some 
of the required environmental monitoring was found 
to be of little value, such as water column nutrient 
impact sampling, because the results were too 
variable and not really of consequence since 
commercial pens were all located in waters naturally 
replete with nitrogen and phosphorous, as discussed 
in the Washington State programmatic EIS on 
floating fish culture and its technical appendices 
(Rensel, 1989; WDF, 1990).  
 
Other risks, including proliferation of human and fish 
pathogens and heavy metal contamination from feed, 
have been evaluated (Table 2.6.1, see Nash 2001, 
2003 for review).  Biodeposits from salmon farms 
have been shown to settle to the benthos, increase 
sediment sulfide, lower redox potential and influence 
the benthic community in a somewhat complex but 
predictable manner.  Changes have been shown to 
occur most strongly beneath the culture operations, 
but have been noted as far away as 225 m several 
decades ago in some poorly sited and operated farms 
which are no longer in production.  Since 1996 all 
farms are only allowed a 30-m sediment impact zone 
around the cages and at the perimeter of that zone 
background conditions of total organic carbon, zinc 
and copper must meet background reference 
conditions.  If a farm site fails then additional benthic 
infauna sampling must be conducted at those same 
locations and statistically compared to reference area 
Section 2  Marine Aquaculture Legislative Frameworks 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   59 
results.  When these same organic particles are 
distributed farther away by stronger currents or 
sediment resuspension, they are also capable of 
biological enrichment, i.e., the “halo” effect around 
any organic discharge source in marine waters 
(Pearson and Rosenberg, 1978) which may result in 
increased diversity and abundance of infauna or 
higher food web organisms, including marine birds 
that feed on biofouling on the pens and benthic 
organisms near the cages, resulting in higher marine 
bird densities than in nonfish farming areas nearby 
(Rensel and Forster, 2007).  
   
When wastes reach the benthos they are assimilated 
first, in an aerobic manner by aerobic bacteria, 
infauna and other organisms.  If the rate of 
particulate carbon bearing wastes exceeds the ability 
of that community to assimilate, the system slowly 
shifts to an anaerobic system where anaerobic sulfur 
reducing bacteria replace the aerobes and oxygen 
dependent macroinfauna (e.g., polychaete worms).  
Management and regulatory guidelines are thus 
constructed to limit the spatial extent of this impact 
and the 30-m sediment impact zone limit around the 
pens usually results in aerobic sediments, even under 
the middle of the cages.  Maintenance of an active 
and diverse benthic infauna helps speed up the 
assimilation of wastes through bioturbation, i.e., 
burrowing through the sediments that increases the 
supply rate of dissolved oxygen from the overlying 
water/sediment boundary.  
 
Relatively rapid chemical and biological remediation 
has been shown to occur naturally during fallow 
periods at most affected sites, depending on the 
currents and physical conditions in the affected area 
(Brooks and Mahnken, 2003a; Brooks et al., 2003).  
Zinc is an essential trace element which is often 
added to the feed for salmon nutrition and while the 
sediment quality criteria for this element (270 g 
zinc/g dry sediment) have been shown to be 
exceeded in rare cases, the degree of risk has been 
more recently reduced by changes in feed 
formulations (Brooks and Mahnken, 2003b).  After 
15 years of periodic monitoring at all net pen sites in 
marine waters of Washington State, no violation of 
the sediment standards for zinc or copper have ever 
been recorded (J. Rensel, pers. comm. and annual 
reports to Washington Department of Ecology).  
Disease interactions between wild and farmed 
salmon are not considered of great significance in 
Washington State because most diseases appear to be 
limited to the farmed fish or are endemic in wild fish 
populations.  Sea lice infection, which is of concern 
elsewhere (Marty et al., 2010) is extremely rare in 
Washington State, primarily due to low salinity.

3 Pathogens of Aquatic Animals: Detection, Diagnosis and Risks 
of Interactions between Wild and Farmed Populations in 
PICES Member Countries 
 
3.1 Overview 
 
Most PICES member countries have a good understanding of diseases in cultured animals but limited 
information or research activities related to understanding disease in wild populations. They also have different 
interests with respect to diseases of concern and host species, and vary widely in their research and diagnostic 
capacity and magnitude of disease monitoring in both cultured and wild populations. This section provides 
different member country inputs on various infectious diseases of regional or economic importance in 
aquaculture in the North Pacific. 
3.2 Canada

Section 3  Pathogens of Aquatic Animals 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   65 
3.2.2 Regulations/Rules Regarding Aquatic 
Animal Health 
In 2005, the Government of Canada, supported by its 
aquaculture stakeholders, invested in the development 
and establishment of a National Aquatic Animal 
Health Program (NAAHP). The NAAHP is 
administered by the Canadian Food Inspection 
Agency (CFIA) and co-delivered with Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada (DFO). 
 
The CFIA is the lead federal agency for the NAAHP, 
getting its authority from the Health of Animals 
Regulations (HAR) and Ministerial Reportable Disease 
Regulations under the Health of Animals Act (HAA)  
http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-91-
2/FullText.html).  The HAR were amended to include 
aquatic animals and these amendments became 
effective on December 22, 2010.  Aquatic animal 
diseases were added to the Reportable Diseases 
Regulations on January 5, 2011. DFO retains the 
responsibility for health surveillance of wild aquatic 
resources, under CFIA Program development. 
 
Prior to these amendments, the health of aquatic 
animals was the responsibility of DFO, getting its 
authority from the Fish Health Protection 
Regulations (FHPR) (see http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/ 
science/enviro/aah-saa/documents/moc-gdp-eng.pdf) 
under the Fisheries Act of Canada (http://laws-
lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/ acts/F-14/).  These regulations 
covered only salmonid fishes.  The National Code on 
Introductions and Transfers of Aquatic Organisms 
provides a mechanism (Introductions and Transfers 
Committees) for assessing proposals to move aquatic 
organisms  
(see http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/enviro/ais-
eae/code/Code2003-eng.pdf).  This code is designed 
to reduce risks:  
1. of harmful alterations to natural aquatic ecosystems;  
2. of deleterious genetic changes in indigenous aquatic 
animal populations;  
3. to aquatic animal health from the potential 
introduction and spread of pathogens and parasites 
that might accompany aquatic organisms being 
moved.  
  
At present, Canada is in a transition state between 
these sets of regulations with components of the 
NAAHP being phased in over time.  At this time the 
CFIA has assumed authority for the import and 
export of aquatic animals and domestic disease 
control in cultured species (and wild stocks where 
there may be trade implications) for those diseases 
listed as reportable or immediately notifiable 
(http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/aqua/dise
mala/repe.shtml).  Effective December 10, 2011, 
international imports of any of the aquatic animals 
listed in Schedule III of the HAR require an import 
permit issued by the CFIA under the authority of the 
HAR.  The control and issuance of permits for 
domestic movements of aquatic animals will remain 
under the Fish Health Protection Regulations and the 
Fisheries (General) Regulations, following the 
National Code on Introductions and Transfers of 
Aquatic Organisms until the CFIA has domestic 
movement controls in place. 
 
On December 18, 2010, DFO assumed a greater role 
in the management of aquaculture activities in the 
province of British Columbia through the Pacific 
Aquaculture Regulations.  As of this date all finfish, 
shellfish and freshwater aquaculture operations within 
the province require a federal aquaculture license 
issued under the Fisheries Act, a federal Navigable 
Waters Protection Act permit and a lease from the 
province of British Columbia in order to continue 
business.  As part of this licensing, all operations are 
required to develop fish health management plans and 
to participate in government health audits.   
 
The CFIA has established the biocontainment levels, 
procedures and protocols that are needed to work 
safely with animal and zoonotic pathogens.  With 
respect to the importation and research on imported 
aquatic animal pathogens or infectious materials, the 
CFIA has recently published the Containment 
Standards for Facilities Handling Aquatic Animal 
Pathogens  http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/sci/bi
o/anima/aqu/aque.shtml.  While these standards are 
mandatory for facilities importing aquatic pathogens, 
they also provide general guidance on the design and 
operating requirements for any aquatic animal 
containment facility.  
 
3.2.3 National and/or Regional Programs 
Related to the Diagnosis and Control 
of Diseases of Aquatic Animals 
For all of Canada, and for those diseases listed as 
reportable or immediately notifiable in the 
Reportable Diseases Regulations, the CFIA is 
responsible for field operation activities in all 
instances where animals are under the control or care 
of individuals (e.g., aquaculture and enhancement 
Pathogens of Aquatic Animals  Section 3 
66  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
operations).  The CFIA also leads the investigation 
when reportable or immediately notifiable diseases 
are suspected or detected in wild populations.  
 
NAAHP staff perform and coordinate sampling for 
disease surveillance and monitoring of wild stocks, 
direct and deliver diagnostic testing, and conduct 
technology development and targeted research in 
support of the NAAHP.  In British Columbia, 
veterinarians employed by DFO play various roles in 
the diagnosis and control of diseases, such as the 
provision of veterinary services for enhancement 
facilities and aquatic animal health auditing functions 
as specified in the Pacific Aquaculture Regulations. 
In other provinces and territories of Canada, the roles 
of federal and provincial/territorial departments in 
aquatic animal health vary.   
 
As part of the NAAHP, a new regulatory diagnostic 
laboratory system was built from DFO’s existing 
aquatic animal health laboratory infrastructure.  The 
National Aquatic Animal Health Laboratory System 
(NAAHLS) is comprised of four federal laboratories 
consisting of the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) 
located in Nanaimo, British Columbia, the 
Freshwater Institute (FWI) in Winnipeg, Manitoba, 
the Gulf Fisheries Centre (GFC) in Moncton, New 
Brunswick, and the Charlottetown Aquatic Animal 
Pathogen and Biocontainment Lab (CAAPBL) in 
Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island.  Each of these 
laboratories has assumed responsibility as reference 
laboratories for the endemic pathogens that are 
causative agents of reportable or immediately 
notifiable diseases.  All NAAHLS laboratories are 
working towards ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accreditation. 
 
In Canada diagnostic and veterinarian services for the 
aquaculture industry are provided through in-house 
veterinarians or by private companies.  Some 
universities (e.g., Atlantic Veterinary College) and 
non-profit laboratories (e.g., BC Center for Aquatic 
Health Sciences) provide diagnostic services for a fee. 
 
3.2.4 Methods Used for the Identification and 
Detection of Pathogens of Concern 
Finfish diagnostic methods 
The FHPR outlines methods for the detection of the 
following pathogens:  
 the viruses causing viral hemorrhagic septicaemia 
(VHS),  
 infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN),  
 infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN), 
 infectious salmon anemia (ISA),  
 the bacterial kidney disease bacterium Renibacterium 
salmoninarum,  
 the redmouth bacterium Yersinia ruckeri, 
 the furunculosis bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida,  
 the protozoans causing whirling disease (Myxobous 
cerebralis) and ceratomyxosis (Ceratomyxa shasta).    
 
Current diagnostic tests approved for regulatory 
purposes are based on these methods or on the 
methods outlined in the OIE (World Organisation for 
Animal Helath). 
Finfish viruses  
Federal, provincial, private, non-profit, and 
university laboratories conducting diagnostics for 
viruses primarily use traditional cell culture based 
assays followed by confirmation and identification of 
suspected virus positive samples by molecular 
analysis (PCR, RT-PCR).   
 
The NAAHP is working towards ISO/IEC 
17025:2005 accreditation of cell culture based assays 
for infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV), viral 
hemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), infectious 
pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), infectious 
hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), spring 
viraemia of carp virus (SVCV), and koi herpes virus 
(KHV). In addition, to facilitate higher throughput 
testing for viruses during surveillance and 
monitoring programs, the NAAHLS is developing 
molecular-based detection methodologies.  Specifically, 
PCR-based diagnostics are being developed or are 
currently undergoing diagnostic validation to meet 
OIE standards and ISO (Organization for 
Standardization) requirements.  At present, quantitative 
reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays are 
being validated for VHSV, IHNV, IPNV, and ISAV. 
Finfish bacteria and parasites 
Canadian laboratories are utilizing standard culture, 
microscopy, and ELISA methods for bacteria and 
parasite testing.  As mentioned above, the FHPR 
describes in detail methods for testing for a variety of 
bacterial and parasitic disease agents. Within British 
Columbia salmonid enhancement facilities, brood 
fish are annually monitored for the prevalence of 
bacterial kidney disease (BKD) using ELISA.  This 
screening is used to reduce the use of BKD-positive 
Section 3  Pathogens of Aquatic Animals 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   67 
fish in breeding programs thereby lessening the 
prevalence of BKD in enhancement facilities.   
 
Within the NAAHP, ISO accreditation is not being 
sought for bacterial or parasitical diagnostic 
procedures at the present time.  However, molecular 
techniques have been developed and are being used 
to identify species of Gyrodactylus found on fish in 
British Columbia waters.   
 
The Centre for Sea Lice Identification was developed 
to serve as a common taxonomic resource shared 
among British Columbia sea lice researchers.  It is 
housed at the Centre for Aquatic Health Sciences 
(CAHS) facility in Campbell River, British Columbia.  
Shellfish diagnostic methods  
In addition to supporting the NAAHP, shellfish 
health programs within DFO conduct ad hoc 
mortality investigations, disease screening for 
introductions and transfers (I&T), and research 
pertaining to specific diseases of concern in support 
of both aquaculture and wild shellfish resources.  For 
the Pacific Region, the shellfish health program is 
located at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS, 
Nanaimo, British Columbia).  
 
Within the NAAHP laboratory system, ISO-
accredited diagnostic procedures for the 
identification of shellfish diseases that are reportable 
under the Health of Animals Act have been or are 
under the process of development.  Histology is used 
for routine diagnostics of shellfish disease for both 
NAAHP and non-NAAHP activities.  For some 
pathogens confirmatory testing is done by molecular 
testing and/or in situ hybridization.  The NAAHP is 
continuing to develop new molecular diagnostic tests 
for reportable diseases of shellfish and crustaceans.  
For example, Mikrocytos mackini is a microcell 
parasite of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) found 
on the west coast of North America.  Researchers at 
PBS are developing and validating to ISO standards 
a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for this 
parasite.  This assay targets the optimal host tissue 
type and is an improvement over histological 
detection methods that can sometimes not detect low 
level infections. 
 
3.2.5 Canadian National Reference 
Laboratories 
Additionally through the NAAHP, national reference 
laboratories have been established for a number of 
pathogens (Table 3.2.2).    
 
As the Program progresses, additional pathogens will 
be added to the list for the three national reference 
laboratories.  The reference laboratories confirm, 
characterize, and archive all positive detections of 
the specific pathogen(s). The laboratories also 
perform technology transfers and proficiency panel 
testing of diagnostic methods for their designated 
pathogen(s).  The reference laboratories maintain 
basic and applied research programs on the specific 
pathogens and contain scientific expertise to 
facilitate pathogen characterization such as viral 
genotyping.  As indicated above, some reference 
laboratories also have OIE reference laboratory 
status for particular pathogens.

3.2.6 Perceived or Realized Risks Associated 
with the Transfer of Pathogens between 
Wild and Farmed Hosts 
Within the Pacific Region, i.e., British Columbia, 
there is a great deal of controversy and a highly 
polarized debate with respect to the real and/or 
perceived risks of aquaculture to wild salmon.  An 
area of particular interest and debate is the role of 
aquaculture as a source of pathogens that have 
negative effects on wild salmon populations.  These 
include the endemic pathogens, IHNV, Renibacterium 
salmoninarum and sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis 
and Caligus clemensi) on pink (Oncorhynchus 
gorbuscha) and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) 
salmon. 
 
This controversy has been recently reflected by the 
inclusion of aquaculture and diseases within the 
terms of reference for the Commission of Inquiry 
into the Decline of Sockeye Salmon in the Fraser 
River (conducted by the British Columbia Supreme 
Court judge, Bruce Cohen). The Cohen Commission 
was established in November 2009 by the 
Government of Canada.  Under its terms of 
reference, the Cohen Commission held hearings to 
investigate and report on causes of the decline of 
Fraser River sockeye salmon. As part of its activities, 
the Cohen Commission engaged scientists to report 
various aspects that may be related to the decline of 
Fraser River sockeye salmon.  With respect to 
aquaculture, scientists produced a series of four 
reports on the topic of impacts of aquaculture on 
Fraser River sockeye salmon.  These reports, which 
are available on the Commission’s website 
http://www.cohencommission.ca/en/TechnicalReports.
php, are as follows: 
 Korman, J. 2011. Summary of information for 
evaluating impacts of salmon farms on survival of 
Fraser River sockeye salmon. Cohen Commission 
Tech. Rep. 5A, 65 pp. Vancouver, BC.  
 Connors, B. 2011. Examination of relationships 
between salmon aquaculture and sockeye salmon 
population dynamics. Cohen Commission Tech. 
Rep. 5B, 115 pp. Vancouver, BC. 
 Noakes, D.J. 2011. Impacts of salmon farms on 
Fraser River sockeye salmon: results of the 
Noakes investigation. Cohen Commission Tech. 
Rep. 5C, 113 pp. Vancouver, BC. 
 Dill, L.M. 2011. Impacts of salmon farms on 
Fraser River sockeye salmon: results of the Dill 
investigation. Cohen Commission Tech. Rept. 
5D, 81 pp. Vancouver, BC. 
The main objective of the reports by Korman (2011) 
and Connors (2011) was to summarize data relevant 
to addressing aquaculture impacts on sockeye 
salmon.  These data were provided to the 
Commission by the aquaculture industry, the 
province of British Columbia and the Government of 
Canada and included time series and spatial data on:  
1. productivity of Fraser River sockeye salmon, 
2. biology of Fraser River sockeye (migration 
routes, etc.), 
3. oceanographic conditions (physical and biological 
parameters), 
4. the aquaculture industry (farm sites, production 
levels, mortality rates, etc.), 
5. pathogens and disease of sockeye and other wild 
salmonids, 
6. pathogens and disease occurrence on salmon 
farms (sea lice and other pathogens). 
 
Even with the relatively large data sets that were 
available, Korman (2011) and Conners (2011) were 
unable to statistically demonstrate any impact of 
aquaculture activities on Fraser River sockeye 
salmon.  
 
The technical reports by Drs. Dill and Noakes 
considered the following factors and their impact on 
sockeye salmon:  (1) Atlantic salmon escapees,  
(2) effects of farm wastes on benthic and pelagic 
habitat quality, and (3) disease on salmon farms (sea 
lice and other diseases).  These authors based parts of 
their analysis on the data and data analysis provided 
in Korman (2011) and Connors (2011). Noakes 
(2011) and Dill (2011) were unable to identify any 
significant effects of aquaculture on Fraser River 
sockeye salmon.   
 
All of the authors of these technical reports make 
reference to limitations in the data that were 
available for their analysis.  This is an important 
point as it clearly demonstrates the requirement for 
well planned long-term monitoring programs: to 
assess the health of farmed and wild salmon 
populations and to collect data on the physical, 
chemical and biological characteristics of the 
environment that directly impact the health of 
salmon, as well as affect the outcome of exposure to 
infectious agents.  Along with monitoring there is 
also the necessity for research in key areas such as:  
1. pathogen transmission rates between farmed and 
wild fish,  
2. pathogen distribution and survival in the 
environment,  
Section 3  Pathogens of Aquatic Animals 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   69 
3. the role of environmental factors in the development 
of disease,  
4. the consequences of pathogen exposure at both the 
individual and population levels under particular 
environmental conditions.   
 
An example of the type of research needed to support 
assessments of disease interaction between wild and 
farmed fish follows.  Infection of British Columbia 
farmed Atlantic salmon with IHNV has resulted in 
serious disease outbreaks over the periods of 1992–
1996 and 2001–2003 (Saksida, 2004; see 
http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/ahc/fish_health/IHNV_report
_2003.pdf). Recently, Dr. Kyle Garver (DFO, Pacific 
Biological Station) and collaborators have been 
examining the potential for IHNV to spread from 
salmon farms.  Laboratory studies have been 
conducted to determine: (1) the minimum infectious 
dose of IHNV for Atlantic and Pacific salmon, (2) 
shedding rates of IHNV from infected Atlantic 
salmon and (3) survival of IHNV in the environment.  
These data have been incorporated into physical 
oceanographic models for the Discovery Island area 
of British Columbia which allows for the prediction 
of IHNV spread from sites within this area.  Similar 
physical models have been used to examine the 
potential for spread of sea lice from farms within the 
Broughton Archipelago. 
  
3.2.7 Conclusions 
There are well developed diagnostic tests for the 
majority of economically and ecologically important 
pathogens of salmonids and commercial bivalve 
species in Canada.  As aquaculture in British 
Columbia is primarily limited to the production of 
salmonids and bivalve mollusks, this means that 
there are sufficient diagnostic tests available to meet 
the needs of disease interactions studies. 
The potential for interactions between farmed and 
wild fish with respect to pathogens and disease 
remains a major issue of concern in British 
Columbia.  Until recently the focus of this concern 
was sea lice.  However, pathogens such as IHNV are 
now becoming more of an issue.  To date, a very 
large amount of effort and relatively high level of 
funding has been applied to this question as it 
pertains to sea lice.  This research has benefited from 
oceanographers, physiologists, ecologists, and fish 
health specialists working together to understand this 
complex question, yet there is still no general 
agreement as to the magnitude of the effects of sea 
lice from farmed fish on populations of wild 
salmonids and vice versa. 
 
A general consensus is developing amongst aquatic 
animal health professionals in British Columbia that 
in order to understand the potential for such 
interactions, a broader ecological approach is 
necessary. This includes understanding how environ-
mental factors directly and indirectly impact the 
production levels and, in the broadest sense, the 
health of wild stocks.  In addition, it will remain 
difficult to predict the outcome of such interactions 
until we have basic information:  
1. on long-term trends such as the prevalence and 
abundance of pathogens in different wild and 
farmed stocks throughout their lifecycle,  
2. for each pathogen, on what conditions trigger the 
development of disease in different host species 
and life history stages,  
3. for each disease, the mortality rate and the sub-
lethal effect(s) of infection for various life history 
stages and under various environmental conditions, 
and  
4. on how the presence of multiple pathogens affects 
such interactions.

3.3 Japan 
 
3.3.1 Current State of Fish Diseases in Japan 
With the increasing number of aquaculture species in 
Japan, outbreaks of diseases have increased (Table 
3.3.1).  Some of the major diseases of the important 
aquaculture species in Japan are: streptococcosis 
caused by Lactococcus garvieae and nocardiosis of 
yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) and amberjack 
(S. dumerili); Edwardsiellosis of Japanese flounder 
(Paralichthys olivaceus); and iridoviral disease of 
red sea bream (Pagrus major).  A long history of 
aquaculture has resulted in numerous diseases in 
salmonids; of these, IHN in rainbow trout 
(Oncorhynchus mykiss) and erythrocytic inclusion 
body syndrome (EIBS) in coho salmon 
(Oncorhynchus kisutch) are the most significant. In 
ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis), bacterial coldwater 
disease (BCWD) from Flavobacterium psychrophilum 
infection is frequently found.  Various diseases of 
larvae and small juveniles occur in hatcheries; of 
these, viral nervous necrosis (VNN), caused by the 
betanodavirus, is a major obstacle in the rearing of 
many fish species.  
 
Previously, fish disease problems have been limited 
to aquaculture facilities where fish are reared in 
intensive conditions.  However, in recent years 
diseases such as koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) 
and bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD) have spread 
and caused damage to wild fish populations. 
 
In recent years, estimated losses of cultured fish from 
diseases have been halved in Japan  (i.e., to around 
4–5%) after previously accounting for 10% of total 
production. Current vaccine usage against 
streptococcosis caused by L. garvieae, which causes 
major losses in yellowtail aquaculture, has 
contributed significantly to reducing losses. 
3.3.2 National Regulation Framework for 
Fish Disease Control in Japan 
Since 1974, discussions have been held between the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
(MAFF) and experts in the field on significant non-
exotic diseases causing losses each year, and on 
invasions by exotic diseases having significant 
potential to affect Japanese aquaculture; the aim is to 
legislate for control measures to treat the risks.  Since 
the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) 
code of aquatic animal health was adopted in 1995, 
MAFF accelerated those discussions, and consequently 
made an amendment to the Act on the Protection of 
Fisheries Resources in 1996 to introduce biosecurity 
measures against exotic disease invasion.  In 
addition, the Act on Maintenance of Sustainable 
Aquaculture Production was established in 1999, and 
it prescribes measures to prevent the domestic spread 
of the listed notifiable diseases.  
 
The Act on the Protection of Fisheries Resources 
demands health certification of imported live aquatic 
animals for the diseases listed in Table 3.3.2.  Under 
the Act, the Animal Quarantine Service carries out 
inspections of imported live animals and can request 
observation of suspicious animals in a containment 
facility for a certain period to ensure they are not 
infected with disease pathogens (Fig. 3.3.1).  As 
shown in Table 3.3.2, the designated diseases for 
biosecurity on imported salmonid and cyprinid fish, 
and penaeid shrimp, are almost the same as the OIE-
listed diseases for these animals.  The diseases 
designated in the Act must be able to be controlled 
after entry into the country.  The controls are based 
on the general international rule that importing 
countries should restrict their requirements to those 
necessary for achieving the appropriate level of 
national protection, as mentioned in the OIE code.

The MAFF ministerial ordinance for the Act on 
Maintenance of Sustainable Aquaculture Production 
specifies that the designated notifiable diseases must 
meet the following criteria: infectious diseases that 
have the potential to cause serious production losses 
and are exotic to Japan or the distribution of the 
disease is restricted to specified geographic regions. 
The designated diseases are notifiable to the 
government, and are the same as those in the Act on 
the Protection of Fisheries Resources, as shown in 
Table 3.3.2.  When a notifiable disease occurs or a 
suspicious animal is found, the prefectural governor 
can order prevention measures to stop further spread 
including destruction of the affected animals, 
restrictions on transfers of animals to other locations, 
and disinfection of the facility and equipment.  The 
cost of the destruction of the animal population is 
compensated at a certain rate.  After the KHVD 
problem appeared in EU countries, discussions were 
held on adding the disease to the notifiable disease 
list.  The ministerial ordinance was consequently 
amended, and KHV disease became a notifiable 
disease in June 2003, as the disease posed a serious 
socio-economic threat to the Japanese carp industry. 
Section 3  Pathogens of Aquatic Animals 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   73 
The National Research Institute of Aquaculture 
(NRIA) of the Fisheries Research Agency 
(incorporated administrative agency of Japan) is 
equipped with a high containment research facility 
for investigation of exotic diseases.  To construct a 
diagnosis system for each notifiable disease, 
information is assembled, including photos of the 
causative pathogens of the affected animal, antisera, 
and histopathological sections.  The actual diagnosis 
of the disease has to follow the diagnostic guideline 
of MAFF based on the OIE Manual of Diagnostic 
Tests for Aquatic Animals.  Briefly, a presumptive 
diagnosis is carried out at a prefectural fisheries 
research institute (PFRI), and then a confirmative 
diagnosis is undertaken by NRIA. NRIA reports the 
final result to the relevant local government and to 
MAFF.  A diagnostic flow chart is shown in Figure 
3.3.2 as an example.  A guideline handbook and 
diagnostic technical manuals with photos are 
provided for practical work; NRIA also provides 
hands-on training to staff of PFRIs, and test control 
materials such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) 
positive controls.  Thus, the diagnostic system for the 
notifiable diseases is established. 
 
3.3.3 System of Diagnosis and Control of 
Aquatic Animal Disease Occurrences 
in Japan 
Japan is composed of 47 local prefectural 
governments.  Each local government has its own 
PFRI.  When a disease of a cultured aquatic animal 
occurs in an aquaculture farm, the farmer usually 
notifies PFRI of the disease occurrence immediately. 
The disease is diagnosed by the fish disease experts 
in the institute, and the farmer is given advice on the 
treatment of the disease.  Furthermore, researchers or 
“aquacultural extension workers” of the local 
government visit the local aquaculture farms 
routinely.  They not only give fish farmers the advice 
to improve culture techniques, but also conduct 
health surveillances of fish in the farms. 
 
The information of fish diseases is passed to MAFF 
of the Japanese government by PFRIs through the 
local governments.  OIE-listed diseases, except for 
notifiable diseases, are also sent to the Japanese 
government in this manner, and are reported to OIE 
annually.

3.3.4 Establishment and Dissemination of 
Diagnostic Methods 
NRIA accepts requests for disease diagnosis of 
aquatic animals from public organizations.  When a 
hitherto unknown disease occurs, causing serious 
problems to fish farmers, PFRIs usually ask NRIA 
for the diagnosis.  Upon request, the disease is 
promptly studied at NRIA to establish a rapid and 
accurate diagnostic method for the disease.  When 
the diagnostic method is established, it is transferred 
to the PFRIs.  NRIA often supplies reagents, such as 
antisera or positive controls needed for the diagnosis.  
To maintain and improve the technical level of 
diagnosis for fish diseases, training and education 
programs are provided for the staff of PFRIs.  NRIA 
provides training classes on such occasions when an 
important new disease appears or the standardization 
of the diagnosis method is needed. Japan Fisheries 
Resource Conservation Association (JFRCA, a 
governmental incorporated association) provides a 
systematic training course of fish diseases for the 
people working for PFRIs.  The course program 
includes various subjects from the laws concerning 
fish health and disease prevention in Japan, and basic 
physiology of fish to various disease subjects such as 
virology, bacteriology, or parasitology.  At the end of 
the course, the trainees are required to take an 
examination to be qualified as fish disease experts by 
JFRCA.  
 
NRIA and JFRCA also distribute diagnostic reagents 
such as antisera or positive controls for PCR to the 
PFRIs in order to help their work and maintain their 
level and accuracy of diagnosis.  Thus, the diseases 
of aquatic animals are monitored carefully against 
their occurrences by PFRIs, with a higher level of 
diagnostic techniques. 
 
3.3.5 Case Studies of Aquatic Animal Diseases 
between Wild and Cultured Populations 
Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the pathogen of 
BCWD, could enter into Japan by the importation of 
coho salmon eyed-eggs from North America. 
Cultured ayu were infected by this disease in 1987
 
(Wakabayashi et al., 1994). The release of ayu into 
natural waters to enhance stocks for angling has 
probably contributed to the domestic spread of the 
bacterium.  Occurrence of the disease has gradually 
decreased in recent years, probably because of the 
release of uninfected fish and awareness of 
prevention measures by anglers. Releasing fry into 
the river where the parents were caught has been 
encouraged to maintain genetic variation in the 
population; this practice might also be helping to 
control the disease.    
 
KHVD is the only disease now occurring in Japan 
that is among the notifiable diseases designated 
under the Act on Maintenance of Sustainable 
Aquaculture Production.  A mass mortality of carp 
caused by KHVD was detected in Lake Kasumigaura 
in October 2003 (Sano et al., 2004).  Subsequent 
retrospective investigations using PCR analysis 
demonstrated that carp mortality had occurred in 
another river in May 2003 (Sano et al., 2004); 
because there was no evidence of suspicious mass 
mortality of carp before this case, it is believed to be 
the first occurrence of KHVD in Japan.  The 
outbreak of KHVD in Lake Kasumigaura 
(Takashima et al., 2005) was confirmed in 
November 2003; therefore, for about one month, a 
large number of cultured live carp that were not 
known to be infected had been distributed to other 
locations, including rivers and lakes used for 
stocking.  Thus, by the end of 2003, KHV had 
rapidly spread, and infected carp were found in 23 of 
47 prefectures in Japan.  This serial event, initiated 
by the infected carp in Lake Kasumigaura, had a 
severe impact, as demonstrated by the die-off of 100 
thousand wild carp in Lake Biwa, the largest lake in 
Japan; this event had a significant impact on the carp 
resources of the lake (Matsuoka, 2008).  By the end 
of 2004, KHVD was found in 39 of the 47 
prefectures.  Almost all of the cases of KHV 
infection that happened in early 2004 could be linked 
to the carp that were originally infected in Lake 
Kasumigaura.  The 2004 outbreak of the disease was 
the highest recorded in the history of KHVD in 
Japan; subsequently, occurrences have been 
decreasing each year because of the measures that 
have been implemented according to the Act, e.g., 
destruction of infected fish, and bans on the transfer 
of fish to other waters.  Aquaculture farms and game 
fishing facilities, which previously had KHVD, were 
completely disinfected with chemicals and restocked 
with uninfected carp; this then resulted in the 
successful cultivation of fish without reoccurrence of 
KHVD.  In contrast, in natural waters like rivers and 
lakes, where all of the carp cannot be removed, it 
may be impossible to eradicate KHV. Therefore, 
measures are limited to prohibition of the transport of 
infected carp to other places.  Nevertheless, high 
mortality of carp has not been observed in natural 
Section 3  Pathogens of Aquatic Animals 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   75 
waters that have previously experienced KHV 
outbreaks.  
 
In kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) 
aquaculture, penaeid acute viremia (= white spot 
disease (WSD)) caused by the penaeid rod-shaped 
DNA virus (= white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)), 
damaged shrimp production in 1993 in facilities 
where imported shrimp seedlings were introduced 
from China (Kimura et al., 1996).  In the next year, 
the disease spread to a number of culture ponds in 
the western part of Japan, and caused severe 
economic losses to the industry. When the disease 
first appeared, it was a new, unidentified disease.  Serial 
investigations were carried out on identification of 
the causative agent, development of a detection 
method and prevention measures.  The causative 
agent, WSSV, is uncultivable because of a lack of 
adequate susceptible cells; hence, a PCR-based 
detection method was developed and became a 
powerful tool for detection
 
(Nakano et al., 1994). 
Many PFRIs have installed the equipment, e.g., 
thermal cycler to run the PCR diagnosis of the 
disease.  To prepare uninfected seedlings of the 
shrimp for aquaculture, prevention measures for 
hatcheries were developed including virus checking 
of broodstocks and larvae, disinfection of the water 
supply and containment rearing. In addition, 
awareness of the disease by people in charge of both 
seedling and aquaculture operations has increased, 
and now prevention measures in aquaculture 
facilities include the following: disinfection of the 
bottom sand with chemicals, scarifying and drying 
the bottom sand in the sun, and use of uninfected 
seedlings at low rearing densities. In recent years, 
damage due to WSD in Japan has markedly 
decreased.  For wild populations of aquatic animals, 
surveillance of some particular diseases, such as 
WSD of kuruma shrimp, are occasionally made.  
However, it is difficult to monitor disease outbreaks 
in aquatic animals in the sea. Hence, the comprehensive 
understanding of the relationship of diseases between 
wild and cultured aquatic animals are yet to be 
achieved, and this is certainly an important subject 
for future study.

3.4 Republic of Korea 
 
3.4.1 Status of Fish Diseases in Korea 
Since a pilot-scale net cage program was first 
launched to culture marine fish on the south coast of 
Korea in 1964, the aquaculture industry has 
expanded rapidly with the help of artificial seed 
production technology, especially during the 1980s.  
At the same time, however, mass mortalities of 
animals in culture have been increasingly reported 
due to environmental pollution, overstocking of fish 
and outbreaks of infectious diseases.  The main types 
of aquaculture diseases during the 1990s were a 
combination of bacterial and parasitic infection, and 
viral infection alone.  This pattern became more 
obvious in the late 1990s when aquaculture diseases 
were caused mainly by viral infections alone or by 
combinations of bacteria with other types of bacteria 
or parasites.  Overall, complicated infections caused 
by more than two types of pathogen have increased 
over the years (Fig. 3.4.1). 
 
A diagnostic survey in fish farms with land-based 
tanks and net cases was conducted on the eastern, 
western, and southern coasts of Korea and Jeju island 
during summer from 2000 to 2005.  A total of 2,528 
marine and freshwater fish samples were diagnosed 
for infectious diseases.  Major infected fish species 
were olive flounder, black rockfish, sea bream, gray 
mullet, and rainbow trout, and the main pathogens 
revealed were Edwardsiellosis, Streptococcosis, 
Vibriosis, Scuticociliatosis, Iridovirus, Viral 
hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and Viral 
nervous necrosis virus (VNNV). 
 
Edwardsiellosis is a generalized septicaemia which is 
often associated with poor water quality and stress in 
fish. Disease signs may include small cutaneous 
lesions that can develop into necrotic abscesses, 
distended abdomen and swollen anus due to the 
accumulation of ascitic fluid, pigment loss, enlarged 
kidney, and abscesses on internal organs.

PICES Scientific Report No. 44   77 
Streptococcosis has occured frequently in recent 
years. Beta-hemolytic streptococcus is the causative 
bacterium which possesses the same biochemical and 
serological characteristics as streptococci isolated 
from some marine and freshwater fish, and seems to 
be related to Streptococcus iniae.  S. iniae and 
S. parauberis are major bacterial pathogens of 
cultured olive flounder in Korea. 
 
Vibriosis has caused severe economic losses in the 
fish farming industry worldwide. Vibrio anguillarum 
is a gram-negative, comma-shaped rod bacterium 
classified to the family Vibrionaceae.  It is a 
halophilic bacterium which causes vibriosis or 
hemorrhagic septicemia in wild marine fish, 
cultured-marine fish, freshwater fish, and other 
aquatic animals in Korea.  
 
Scuticociliatosis invades the skin, fins, muscles, 
peritoneal cavity, kidney, pancreas and brain of 
flounder, often leading to death of the host.  Heavily 
infected fish are difficult to treat, in particular when 
the ciliates enter the brain.  In recent years, the 
number of scuticociliatosis outbreaks has increased 
explosively in Korea’s flounder fry industry.  This 
parasitic disease often results in massive deaths and 
considerable economic loss. 
 
Iridovirus infection has frequently occurred among 
cultured fish in Korea. Korean isolates were found to 
be similar to the Japanese isolate RSIV and one to 
the Chinese isolate ISKNV; the other Korean isolates 
were distinct from other foreign iridovirus isolates. 
 
VHSV has caused economically serious damage to 
the olive flounder farming industry in Korea.  Since 
2001, VHS has become a common problem in olive 
flounder farms during low temperature seasons.  In 
2005, mass mortality of adult flounder occurred on 
the southern coast of Korea. 
 
In 1998, VNNV was first reported in sevenband 
grouper in Korea.  Since then, high mortality caused 
by fish nodavirus infection has frequently occurred 
among marine cultured fish. 
 
3.4.2 System of Diagnosis and Control of 
Aquatic Animals 
There is an urgent need to strengthen quarantines to 
block the inflow of new overseas diseases due to the 
rise in international trade of fishery products. The 
enacted Agreement on the Application of Sanitary 
and Phytosanitary Measures of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO/SPS) requires countries to adopt 
a balance between using sanitary and phytosanitary 
measures to ensure the health protection of its 
population while guaranteeing that the measures are 
not misused for protectionist purposes, and to 
conduct international duties for OIE-reported 
diseases, making the disease control infrastructure a 
critical trade issue. 
    
As a nationally designated aquatic animal quarantine 
research institute, NFRDI (National Fisheries 
Research and Development Institute) develops and 
distributes international/national standard protocols 
with immunological and molecular biological 
technology, arranges international standard 
laboratories and promotes the disease control 
infrastructure for OIE-reported diseases and data 
exchange.  A diagnostic manual for aquatic animal 
diseases is shown in Figure 3.4.2. 
 
3.4.3 Fish Vaccine Development in Korea 
Infectious diseases such as Edwardsiellosis, 
Streptococcosis and Iridovirus, pose the biggest 
single threat to aquaculture in Korea.  
 
Vaccines have become one of the major approaches 
to combat fish diseases in recent years and have 
made a major contribution to improvements of fish 
health in aquaculture.  Developing fish vaccines 
could potentially save aquaculture producers money 
worldwide by preventing these diseases.  Reduction 
of disease outbreaks has a flow-on effect to decrease 
antibiotic usage, aiding in the promotion of Korea’s 
“clean green” image.  Other advantages include 
reducing antibiotic use to control these bacteria in 
culture fish, making a safer, more environmentally 
friendly consumer product.  
 
There has been much research into the development of 
effective vaccines, immunostimulants and adjuvants in 
fish.  The introduction of a new generation of both oil- 
and non-oil adjuvants has greatly improved the 
efficacy of bacterial vaccines and has resulted in an 
impressive reduction in mortalities.  
 
The vaccination strategies for the control of viral and 
bacterial diseases in aquaculture are being studied.  
For more efficient disease control, NFRDI has been 
Pathogens of Aquatic Animals  Section 3

Fig. 3.4.2 Diagnostic manual for aquatic animal diseases produced by NFRDI. 
 
 
conducting research into the development of fish 
disease vaccines to convert the existing disease 
treatment system to a disease prevention system. 
NFRDI developed a Streptococcosis, Edwardsiellosis, 
Vibriosis, Streptococcosis-Edwardsiellosis mixed 
inactivated bacterial vaccine for flounder and 
recombinant protein vaccine against parrot fish 
iridovirus in 2005.  The disease prevention efficiency 
rate of a developed vaccine against a target disease was 
estimated to be 70% since the start of the application.  
 
A vaccine against Nodavirus and a triple mixed 
vaccine against Streptococcosis (Streptococcus iniae 
and S. parauberis) and Edwardsiellosis (Edward-
siella tarda) were developed by NFRDI in 2010. 
These vaccines have been shown to be protective 
against their respective diseases. 
3.4.4 Monitoring of Wild Marine Fish in 
Korea 
Disease surveillance was performed to monitor the 
prevalence of fish pathogens in wild marine fish 
caught in coastal offshore waters in 2008.  Fish 
samples were collected from fish markets at landing 
ports on the eastern, western and southern coasts of 
the Korean peninsula. Seventeen kinds of fish 
pathogens were isolated from 152 fish samples.  The 
detection rates of parasites, bacteria or viruses were 
21.4, 17.0 and 2.7%, respectively. Some of the 
detected pathogens and detection rates are shown in 
Table 3.4.1.

3.4.5 National Regulation for Control of 
Aquatic Animal Diseases 
Aquatic Animal Disease Control Act 
The Aquatic Animal Disease Control Act took effect 
in December, 2007.  
 The aim of the Act is to assure the prevention of 
outbreaks and spread of aquatic animal diseases 
in Korea.  
 The way of prevention of aquatic animal diseases 
is through notification of aquatic animal diseases, 
health surveillance, disinfection or destruction, 
risk analysis and import/export quarantine.  
 There are presently 11 kinds of legally-designated 
diseases in fish, 5 kinds in shellfish and 9 kinds in 
crustaceans. 
 Monitoring, surveillance, movement control or 
stamping out will be enforced for any disease 
confirmed by qualified diagnostic laboratories.  
 All live aquatic animals (such as fish, molluscs, 
shrimp) or eggs or gametes have to be declared free 
from listed diseases for importation into Korea.  
 
The National Fisheries Products Quality Inspection 
Service is the frontier post for international trade of 
live aquatic animals that provides quarantine services 
as well as the preparation of international aquatic 
animal health certificates.

3.5 Russia 
 
3.5.1 Regulatory Framework for Aquatic 
Organisms Health in Russia 
Russian aquaculture activity is regulated by laws of 
the Russian Federation. The State standards and 
requests are issued by several ministries and agencies 
under the government of Russia (Federal Fishery 
Agency, Nature Protection Ministry and others). There 
are several law-making documents regulating the 
environmental quality and control of habitat alteration 
for seafood safety.  Key examples are: 
 “List of maximal permissible concentrations for 
fisheries ground”, 
 “Federal sanitary norms and rules”. 
 
In these documents the federal norms for control of toxic 
substances, heavy metals, pathogenic micro-organisms, 
organic pollutants and others have been established. The 
monitoring of aquaculture diseases in Russia is 
carried out by the icthyopathological inspection of 
the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary 
Supervision under the Ministry of Agriculture. 
3.5.2 Aquatic Animal Diseases in Russia  
The Russian Federation list of quarantine and 
especially dangerous fish diseases consists of: 
 Viral hemorrhagic septicemia of salmonids (VHS), 
 Epizootic pancreatic necrosis of salmonids, 
 Epizootic hematopoietic necrosis of salmonids 
(EHN), 
 Epizootic anaemia of salmonids, 
 Bacterial kidney disease (BKD), 
 Mixobacteriosis, 
 Aeromonosis, 
 Branchiomycosis, 
 Spring viremia of carp (SVC), 
 Sphaerosporosis of carp, 
 Gyrodactylosis, 
 Philometroidosis, 
 Bothriocephalosis.

3.5.3 Conclusion 
The health of aquatic organisms in Russia is the 
subject of public policy. Diseases of aquatic 
organisms are controlled by the State Veterinary 
Service. It is constructed on administrative-territorial 
basis; its branches (departments, laboratories) are 
found in all major cities, regional and district centers. 
Veterinary departments provide the leading and 
coordinating role. Veterinary laboratories diagnose 
and monitor aquatic organism diseases.  Many 
diseases of aquatic organisms prevalent in the world 
are considered missing in the country as Russia has a 
low level of aquaculture development. However, it 
will be necessary to coordinate the internal standards 
of Russia with international aquaculture regulations.

3.6 United States of America 
 
3.6.1 Regulatory Framework for Fish 
Health in the United States 
The regulatory framework for aquatic animal health 
and assessment in the United States is based on 
State-Federal partnership.  The Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture is the co-competent 
authority for aquatic animal health; the head of 
APHIS Veterinary Services is the Chief Veterinary 
Officer for the United States.  APHIS shares federal 
authority with other federal agencies, specifically the 
U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine 
Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries), and the U.S. 
Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service 
(FWS), and local authority with the individual States.  
The State authority for fish health is named 
independently by each State, but typically resides in 
the Departments of Agriculture, Fish and Wildlife 
and/or Marine Resources.  
  
APHIS is granted the authority to govern the 
prevention, detection, control and eradication of 
animal diseases under the Animal Health Protection 
Act (http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/7/usc_sup_ 
01_7_10_109.html), where animal is defined as any 
member of the animal kingdom (excluding humans).  
The Lacey Act further specifies that it is unlawful for 
any person to market, transport or acquire fish or 
wildlife in violation of any law, treaty or regulation 
of the United States (http://www.law.cornell.edu/ 
uscode/16/3371.html;  http://www.law.cornell.edu/usc
ode/16/3378.html).  State laws and regulations 
pertaining to aquatic animal health and/or import 
requirements  provide  local  support  (http://www.aph
is.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_dis_spec/aquacultur
e/aquastates.shtml). 
 
Accredited private veterinarians augment State and 
Federal regulatory authority.  More than 80% of all 
U.S. veterinarians are accredited by APHIS.  
Activities for accredited veterinarians include issuing 
export health certificates.  These certificates are 
endorsed by APHIS Veterinary Services (VS) as the 
competent veterinary authority of aquatic animal 
health.  APHIS-accredited veterinarians may also 
participate in official surveillance and eradication 
programs. Private veterinarians seeking accreditation 
complete training modules to become familiar with 
APHIS programs and reportable OIE (World 
Organisation for Animal Health) diseases, as well as 
regulatory requirements for import and export 
(http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/vet_accredi
tation/), renewed every 3 years.  Accredited 
veterinarians are required by law (Title 9 CFR Chapter 
161; http://cfr.regstoday.com/9cfr161.aspx) to im-
mediately notify federal authorities of any confirmed 
or suspected findings of diseases under U.S. control 
or eradication programs, or any communicable 
disease not known to exist in the United States. 
 
In November 2008, APHIS entered into a 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to 
coordinate aquatic animal health activities among 
participating Federal and State agencies.  Per this 
MOU, APHIS is the lead agency responsible for the 
issuance of export animal health certificates for 
farm-raised aquatic livestock.  NOAA Fisheries is 
the lead agency responsible for the issuance of export 
health certificates for marine wildlife or feral aquatic 
animals.  FWS is the lead agency responsible for the 
issuance of export health certificates for freshwater 
wildlife and feral aquatic animals. The MOU 
authorizes NOAA and FWS to request APHIS to 
issue export health certificates on their behalf. 
Currently, all live animal export certificates for 
aquatic animals not intended for human consumption 
(but which are under the nominal jurisdiction of 
FWS and NOAA) are endorsed by APHIS per 
request of NOAA and FWS.   
 
The National Aquatic Animal Health Plan 
(NAAHP), directed through the Joint Subcommittee 
on Aquaculture, coordinates responsibilities and 
activities among the agencies involved in fish health 
in  the  United  States  (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/an
imal_health/animal_dis_spec/aquaculture/naah_plan.
shtml).  The NAAHP is not a regulation but provides 
guiding principles and recommendations to industry, 
States, tribes and Federal agencies on actions to 
Section 3  Pathogens of Aquatic Animals 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   85 
protect the health of wild and farmed aquatic 
animals, to minimize the impacts of disease when 
they occur, and to facilitate the legal movement of 
aquatic animals and their germplasm in interstate and 
international commerce. 
 
3.6.2 Laboratory Diagnostics 
The USDA’s National Veterinary Services 
Laboratories  (NVSL;  http://www.aphis.usda.gov/an
imal_health/lab_info_services/about_nvsl.shtml) act 
as the reference laboratory for confirmation of aquatic 
animal diseases new to the United States, or emerging 
in new regions or species within the United States.  
Aquatic animal disease testing for routine surveillance, 
movement testing or disease investigations are 
conducted at a variety of independent, State and/or 
Federal laboratories, most typically following 
American Fisheries Society (AFS) Blue Book or  
the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic 
Animals  (http://www.oie.int/international-standard-
setting/aquatic-manual) standards, depending on 
pathogen and testing purpose.  The NVSL approves 
individual laboratories for diagnostic functions for 
specific pathogens of federal concern.  At present, 22 
laboratories are USDA approved to conduct 
diagnostic testing in support of export health 
certification  of  aquaculture  species  (http://www.ap
his.usda.gov/biotechnology/index.shtml).  A working 
group is currently developing requirements for 
participation in the National Aquatic Animal 
Pathogen Testing Network (NAAPTN), which 
include the development of Quality Assessments and 
Quality Controls for high priority aquatic pathogens 
of concern.  Initial efforts have been focused on viral 
hemorrhagic septicemia diagnostics. 
 
3.6.3 Current State of Fish Diseases in the 
United States 
The National Animal Health Reporting System 
(NAHRS) is a cooperative project of the U.S. Animal 
Health Association (USAHA), the American 
Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians 
(AAVLD), and the USDA APHIS.  State and Federal 
animal health authorities, industries, and the 
academic, diagnostic, food safety, and practicing 
components of the veterinary profession contribute 
reports of confirmed disease to the system. The 
NAHRS is designed to gather monthly qualitative 
information from Chief State Animal Health 
Officials on the presence of confirmed disease in 
livestock, poultry and aquaculture species in the 
United States. Identifying information is not a feature 
of these reports.  In NAHRS reporting a “yes” 
response from a State indicates that at least one new 
positive case of disease was confirmed during that 
specific month.  A “no” response indicates that no 
new positive confirmed cases of disease were noted 
in the State during that specific month.  The NAHRS 
information is used as a source in preparing the 
USDA’s semi-annual/annual reports to the OIE on 
the occurrence of animal diseases in the United 
States.  These reports can be accessed on OIE’s 
World Animal Health Information Database 
(WAHID; www.oie.int/wahid).  The NAHRS is one 
part of a comprehensive and integrated animal health 
information system that monitors disease status in 
the United States.  Other components include routine 
or periodic active surveillance initiated through State 
or Federal efforts, movement testing or routine 
surveillance via producers, and emergency disease 
control programs.  A few examples are provided 
below. 
 
APHIS VS conducts or coordinates disease control 
programs and/or surveillance initiatives for aquatic 
animal  diseases  as  needed  (http://www.aphis.usda.go
v/animal_health/animal_dis_spec/aquaculture/).  The 
Infectious Salmon Anemia Program is an example 
aquatic animal disease control program that 
highlights State–Federal partnership.  In response to 
the 2001 emergence of Infectious Salmon Anemia 
(ISA) in Maine, the United States initiated an 
emergency program for ISA.  Participation in the 
ISA Program, though voluntary at the Federal level, 
was a requirement for receipt of indemnity funds 
provided during the initial 2 years, and also an 
ongoing requirement of site stocking permits granted 
through the State of Maine Department of Marine 
Resources (DMR).  The ISA Program initiated 
emergency response activities including a bay-wide 
depopulation effort in 2002, followed by 
surveillance, biosecurity and disease control training, 
evaluation and oversight.  Because the epicenter of 
the ISA outbreaks was centered in a region that 
extends across the U.S.–Canadian international 
border, extensive efforts were focused on 
harmonizing ISA Programs and activities between 
USDA, Maine DMR and New Brunswick’s 
Department of Aquaculture and Agriculture (DAA) 
bilaterally. Through the ISA Program, USDA also 
partnered with NOAA to evaluate the possibility of a 
marine reservoir of ISAV in free-ranging fish 
Pathogens of Aquatic Animals  Section 3 
86  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
populations  (http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/salmon/fact
sheets/disease_factsheet.pdf), and with New 
Brunswick DAA, local veterinarians, the industry, 
laboratory and research scientists to complete a 
number of epidemiologic studies to fine-tune control 
efforts.  The last detection of pathogenic ISAV 
occurred in February 2006.  Occasional detections 
occur of a non-pathogenic genotype which have 
sequenced as a European HPR0; however, none of 
these findings have successfully cultured and none 
are associated with evidence of clinical disease.  
Surveillance for ISAV in Maine is routine and 
ongoing.  More recently, federal funds have also 
been appropriated to facilitate surveillance for ISAV 
in the U.S. Pacific Northwest in response to 
investigation of possible findings of novel viral 
genetic material in wild Pacific salmonids in British 
Columbia.  Results of this surveillance to date have 
been negative for ISAV.   
 
VHS surveillance is another example of national 
disease control through partnership.  VHSV IVa is 
considered endemic in certain wild marine populations 
of the North Pacific and periodically detected in 
returning salmonids associated with hatcheries in 
neighboring States.  However, after notification of the 
2005/2006 emergence of a new strain of VHSV (IVb) 
in wild populations of freshwater fish in the Great 
Lakes of the United States and Canada, the U.S. 
implemented an emergency Federal Order restricting 
movement of susceptible species from the Great Lakes 
States or Provinces.  APHIS VS and the Canadian 
Food Animal Inspection Agency (CFIA), along with 
the Great Lakes Fish Health Committee 
(http://www.glfc.org/boardcomm/fhealth/fhealth.php) 
designed a U.S.–Canada bilateral surveillance plan to 
evaluate the distribution of VHSV IVb, and also 
organized a group of international fish health experts 
to identify risk factors for disease spread of this 
newly emerging pathogen.  APHIS VS federal 
funding provided several years of cooperative 
agreement funding with the States to conduct 
surveillance, control and education efforts to prevent 
the spread of VHS outside of the known affected 
waters or to aquaculture operations.  States updated 
testing requirements for fish movement both within 
and between State boundaries, and initiated public 
education campaigns to prevent spread through 
recreational fishing or boating.  The U.S. FWS 
conducts routine surveillance activities in wild or 
feral fish in freshwaters, which contribute 
significantly to the accumulating knowledge base 
about the distribution of VHSV, as well as other 
pathogens (http://www.fws.gov/wildfishsurvey/).  
These collaborative efforts appear successful.  To 
date, VHS IVb has not been found outside the Great 
Lakes States or in farmed fish settings. 
 
The National Surveillance Unit at APHIS VS 
Centers for Epidemiology and Animal Health is also 
available to conduct or consult on the design and/or 
analysis of non-federally funded State or industry 
surveillance efforts.  Several national assessments of 
aquatic animal health were completed in 2012.  
These include:  
1. an analysis of VHSV IVb surveillance to support 
zonation and inter-State trade;  
2. assessment of mollusc health in the Pacific, 
Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico States (including 
status for Bonamia exitiosa, B. ostreae, 
Haplosporidium nelsoni, Marteilia refringens, M. 
sydneyi, Marteiliodes chungmuensis, Mikrocytos 
mackini, ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1), 
Perkinsus marinus, P. olseni, and Vibrio tapetis 
pathogens);  
3. review of the OIE-list crustacean disease status 
(white spot, yellow head and taura syndrome)  in 
the Atlantic and Gulf.   
Data were analyzed for gaps and inefficiencies and 
recommendations were made to improve future 
surveillance. As a result of this State, industry and 
Federal collaborative effort, the United States was 
able to establish disease status by region for many 
OIE notifiable diseases and other diseases of 
concern.  This information will support trade and 
animal movement decisions and help to safeguard 
continued population health.  Currently, efforts are 
underway to review available State, Federal and 
industry surveillance data to support zonation or 
facility certification for OIE-list and other diseases of 
concern in freshwater and marine finfish within the 
United States.  A bilateral U.S.–Canada (APHIS-
CFIA) aquatic animal surveillance working group is 
working in parallel to achieve equivalence and 
efficiency in the approach to disease assessments 
occurring bilaterally or in shared U.S.–Canada 
populations or regions. 
 
3.6.4 Disease Interactions between Wild 
and Farmed Fish 
Aquaculture is developing, and will continue to 
develop at a rapid pace globally.  Consequently, 
disease interactions between farmed and wild aquatic 
animal populations have been a subject of intense 
Section 3  Pathogens of Aquatic Animals 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   87 
debate for a number of years.  Basic tenets of disease 
ecology (such as mechanisms for disease 
transmission) confirm the plausibility of disease 
interactions from farmed to wild fish and wild fish to 
farmed fish, in either direction.  Local transmission 
can occur, for example, via contact or predation of 
wild fish small enough to pass through cage nets, via 
exchange of water, or perhaps through mutual 
contact with personnel, gear, vectors, predators, 
wastes or equipment carrying infectious materials.  
Disease spread can also occur through spill-over to 
new species, or via movement of live or frozen fish 
or their products for trade, stock enhancement or 
routine husbandry practices.  Molecular methods 
able to show genetic lineages may ultimately help to 
confirm epidemiologic connectivity between wild 
and farmed fish disease occurrence.  In the 
meantime, proactive discussions might target best 
methods to foster safe industry and conservation 
practices and reduce opportunities for disease 
transmission, in all settings.  
 
Prevention will likely revolve around two central 
components: biosecurity and surveillance. Biosecurity 
practices reduce the opportunity for introduction, 
release or spread of pathogens associated with 
aquaculture, fisheries, and fish processing activities. 
However, because populations, whether wild or 
farmed, are rarely entirely contained to a specific 
facility or region, basic biosecurity practices on a 
broader scale are equally, if not more, important.  
Examples include State and/or Federal import 
regulations, surveillance and infrastructure for 
disease investigation, and diagnostics and reporting 
that help to ensure that the disease status of countries 
or regions is known and minimally compromised by 
trade or other animal movement activities.  
Knowledge of disease status of both source and 
destination populations can come from a variety of 
surveillance streams, whether passive or active 
surveillance, expert knowledge, historic testing, or 
risk evaluations.  Accurate knowledge of disease 
status supports the health delineation of zones, 
facilities or populations, and minimizes the risk or 
impact of business and management decisions.   
This, in combination with basic biosecurity practices, 
will help to secure the sustained health of both wild 
and farmed aquatic animal populations. 
 
 
 
 
 
Section 4  Summary and Recommendations 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   89 
 
 
 
4 Summary and Recommendations 
 
This report is a summary of the activities that WG 24 
undertook from 2009 to 2012.  The Working Group, 
with the guidance of FIS and MEQ, refined the 
activities under the terms of reference so that each 
PICES member country with active Working Group 
members could contribute to the report.  This 
refinement was required due to the different types of 
expertise needed to meet the three very different 
activities outlined in the terms of reference.  
Additionally, due to external factors, there was a 
concomitant challenge in attracting current and new 
members with expertise in marine aquaculture as 
well as the resources to dedicate to active 
participation in the new Working Group.  
 
Through topic sessions, workshops and targeted 
working group activities, different aspects of 
sustainable marine aquaculture research relevant to 
WG 24’s terms of reference were highlighted.  
Research activities in all PICES member countries 
focus on identifying aquaculture–environment 
interactions, whether to model the impacts or to 
minimize them through optimizing culture approaches, 
as well as on research related to disease identification 
and management. 
 
While there are significant differences in species 
cultured, culture production method and extent, and 
the regulatory and management structure in place in 
the different PICES member countries, the Working 
Group identified some common issues related to 
environmental interactions of marine aquaculture.  
These are as follows:   
 Marine finfish culture has a more significant 
influence on the environment than shellfish or 
algal culture, primarily due to the addition of 
feed, which can influence the physical, chemical 
and biological composition and structure of the 
seafloor below the culture operations; 
 The extent of environmental interactions depends 
greatly on local physical conditions;  
 Near-field, or localized, effects are more 
substantial than far-field (i.e., hundreds of meters 
or further) effects; 
 Far-field effects are not well characterized or 
researched; 
 Rates of ecosystem recovery depend on local 
physical conditions, but are generally rapid in 
environments with high water flow; 
 Most PICES member countries are at least 
examining, if not applying, integrated multi-
trophic aquaculture to mitigate and improve 
interactions; 
 Pathogen detection and diagnoses are informed by 
OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) 
standards; 
 Development and validation of diagnostic 
methods and dissemination of those methods are 
ongoing in most PICES member countries; and 
 It is recognized that pathogens can transfer 
between wild and cultured fish. 
 
Although the original terms of reference requested 
the Working Group to review and evaluate risk 
assessment approaches for aquaculture, it was 
determined that while scientific risk assessment of 
aquaculture activities are being undertaken in PICES 
member countries, the organizations that are active 
within PICES are not always the organizations 
responsible for undertaking these assessments.  
Therefore, the second term of reference was 
modified to focus less on risk assessment per se, but 
instead on providing an overview of the legislative 
framework for evaluating environmental interactions 
of aquaculture which integrate, either explicitly or 
implicitly, aspects of risk assessment.  An overview 
of aquaculture regulatory research was also 
undertaken in order to provide information on 
funding sources and institutions that have expertise 
in aquaculture-environmental interactions research.
  
Summary and Recommendations  Section 4 
90  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
Aquaculture remains an important topic for PICES and 
for the FUTURE program. Based on the experience of 
WG 24, the Working Group recommends that: 
1. Some marine aquaculture issues and analysis can 
be more holistically addressed through expert 
groups that include consideration of anthropogenic 
stressor effects on the marine environment.   
2. Any future marine aquaculture-related PICES 
expert group should be more narrowly focused to 
not only allow for more directed work, but also to 
increase the likelihood of experts from all PICES 
member countries being able to participate and 
contribute.   
3. Active participation from all PICES member 
countries is key to realizing a complete analysis 
of sustainable marine aquaculture issues. 
  
Appendix 1  WG 24 Terms of Reference 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   91 
 
 
Appendix 1    
WG 24 Terms of Reference 
 
1. Evaluate approaches currently being used in the different PICES countries to assess and model the 
interactions of aquaculture operations with surrounding environments.  This will involve conducting a 
comparative assessment of the methodologies, applications, and outputs of different approaches to assess 
finfish, shellfish, seaweed, and/or integrated multi-trophic aquaculture.  Assessments of the approaches 
will include case studies of their application.  As the possibilities for different types of aquaculture and 
their interactions to be assessed are so vast, it is suggested that a process be developed that prioritize and 
limits the options.  A possible process would: 
a) List types of aquaculture and identify major culture technologies and related species of highest interest 
to member states. Select three or four important culture technologies and associated species and assess 
their environmental effects and associated interactions; 
b) Review the scientific literature to ascertain if these possible interactions have been determined to be 
significant; 
c) Identify methodologies used to predict the effects of these interactions and the history/uncertainty 
associated with these predictions; 
d) Examine a variety of institutional decision-making models that are used to limit the effects and 
associated monitoring and mitigation protocols. 
 
2. Review and assess current risk assessment methods used to assess environmental interactions of 
aquaculture and determine what, if anything, should be changed for application in PICES countries to 
reflect ecosystem-specific aspects. Following the review and assessment, identify appropriate case studies 
to compare results among countries in the PICES region. This will be achieved by holding a workshop in 
the second year to compare and discuss possible standardization of methodologies and the selection of 
potential case studies for assessment with a standardized approach. Much of the information for this 
exercise can be derived from “item c” in TOR 1 above. Case studies may then be developed. 
Responsibilities and functions will be similar to the ICES Working Group on Environmental Interactions 
of Mariculture (WG-19), so the feasibility of holding a joint meeting with this group will be explored.  
 
3. Assess methods to detect, identify, evaluate and report on infectious disease events and potential 
interactions between wild and farmed marine animals. If appropriate, develop a recommended 
standardized approach for detection/evaluation/reporting from wild and cultured populations. The focus of 
this activity will be on OIE-notifiable diseases and other infectious diseases of regional/economic 
importance. Discuss and document new and emerging infectious diseases in the PICES region, methods 
for their detection, and develop models to conduct risk assessments of their potential impacts on both 
endemic wild and farmed species.  If resources are available it would be advisable to test these models by 
conducting risk assessments on a few (2-3) emerging pathogens.  Responsibilities and functions will be 
similar to the ICES Working Group on Pathology and Diseases of Marine Organisms (WGPDMO), so the 
possibility of a joint meeting will be explored.  
 
4. As a conclusion to all the above, we propose to hold a PICES session or separate symposium in the third 
year to present case studies and results, and submit for publication as a PICES document, in appropriate 
scientific journals, a summary paper that examines development and application of aquaculture-
environment interaction models.

REPORT OF WORKING GROUP 24 ON  
ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTIONS OF MARINE AQUACULTURE 
 
 
The Working Group on Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture (hereafter WG 24) held its 
inaugural meeting from 9:00–12:00 h on October 25, 2009, under the co-chairmanship of Mr. Kevin Amos, 
Dr. Katsuyuki Obo and Dr. Stewart Johnson (for Ms. Ingrid Burgetz).  A list of participants and the meeting’s 
agenda can be found in WG 24 Endnotes 1 and 2. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 4 
Review of Terms of Reference and reports by activity  
 
Review of Terms of Reference 
Dr. Abo provided a brief review of the Terms of Reference (TOR) for WG 24.  Working Group members were 
asked to review them to ensure that they are relevant to all of the PICES member countries.  Dr. Glen Jamieson 
mentioned that the FUTURE Advisory Panel on Anthropogenic Influences on Coastal Ecosystems (AICE-AP) 
will continue to examine and adjust the TOR over time.  Dr. Steve Rumrill questioned whether the specific 
areas outlined in the TOR would be all explored by WG 24 in the future. There was a short discussion on this 
issue as well as the timing for addressing these specific areas.   
 
Decision: All parties present agreed that the TOR are appropriate for the Working Group at this time.  Specific 
issues to be addressed by the Working Group will be develop before the next Annual Meeting.  
 
Reports of Activity Leaders 
Prior to the meeting, PICES member countries were asked to provide information in the following areas as 
they relate to aquaculture:  
1)  species of interest and production methods,  
2)  risk assessment and  
3)  diseases of aquaculture including potential interactions between wild and farmed marine animals. 
 
The responses received from member countries in response to questions for the three activity areas were 
reviewed by the Activity Leaders. 
 
Activity 1:  Species of interest and production methods (K. Abo) 
Dr. Abo received responses from all countries for this activity, which were summarized and presented.  During 
review of these data several areas requiring revision were identified.  Dr. Abo will revise his summary to 
incorporate information provided during the meeting.  He will then send this revised version to all Working 
Group members for a final review and comment.    
 
Action:  Dr. Abo will produce a finalized document that will be made available to all Working Group 
members.  This document will provide definition for the various culture methods that are used.     
 
Due to the diversity of species under culture in the various member countries, it was suggested by Dr. Stewart 
Johnson that the Group consider the use of functional groups rather than individual species.  Dr. Jamieson 
noted that with respect to examining environmental impacts, then this may be a relevant way to proceed.  Dr. 
Brett Dumbauld supported this view.   
Appendix 3 WG 24 Annual Reports  
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   97 
 
It was suggested using the information received for Activity 1 that three or four general themes suitable for 
more detailed study should be identified. Dr. Rumrill suggested that the Group should focus on helping 
producers understand interactions rather than focusing on differences in production techniques. 
 
Activity 2: Risk Assessment (E. Black) 
Dr. Edward Black reviewed the reference terms of relevance to Activity 2 and then provided a brief summary 
of the responses he received.  The TOR were considered in their broadest sense.  It was questioned if AICE-AP 
was most interested in “thresholds of resistance”.  Dr. Jamieson stated that it was not the only component of 
risk analysis that the AICE-AP considers important. 
   
Based on his experience, Dr. Black pointed out the long period of time that is required to develop and conduct 
risk assessments.  He suggested that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to meet some of the TOR (especially 
the TOR #2) within the 3-year time frame of the Working Group.  The great amount of information that was 
received from the member countries is an important first step in the process of risk assessment. 
   
The Group discussed whether TOR #3 could be achieved.  It was questioned whether the goal should be to 
standardize risk assessment methods or to understand the relationships between the different methods used 
within member countries.  If the latter is the case then rewording of the TOR will be required.    
 
There was further discussion on whether the groups should focus on risk assessment for single species, for a 
specific site or at the ecosystem level.  Most responses to the questionnaire focused on studies of single species 
rather than specific sites or ecosystems. 
     
Mr. Graham Gillespie asked, that since PICES has no official way of providing advice to national 
governments, whether standardization of risk assessment is a reasonable goal for the Group to try to achieve.  
He also noted the necessity to standardize terms within the Working Group. He suggested that the Group 
possibly compile a list of assessment methodologies used in the different countries.  
 
Dr. Gary Wikfors questioned whether standardization of risk assessment methods between countries was 
possible. He briefly discussed the differences between intercalibration and standardization and suggested that 
intercalibration of methods should be the way that the Group should proceed. It was suggested that this could 
be achieved by supplying member countries with a data set that they would analyze using their respective 
methods/standards.  The results of the different analyses then could be compared to understand differences 
between approaches.   
 
Dr. Galina Gavrilova noted that participation in Activity 2 will be difficult for Russian participants as there is 
not a lot of aquaculture development or the legislation to support risk assessment activities in Russia. 
 
Decision:  WG 24 will not work towards standardization of risk assessment methods. Understanding the 
different methods used in the member countries and how these methods compare to each other is a more 
important goal.  
 
Action Items:   
 Dr. Black will produce a spreadsheet similar to Activity 1 to summarize the data that were received and 
circulate it to Working Group members. 
 Dr. Black will confirm by email interest of Working Group members in Activity 2.  
 Dr. Black will provide a list of risk analysis terms and their definitions to Working Group members, with 
the ultimate goal of working towards an agreement of which terms to use. 
 WG 24 will work towards defining its focus with respect to scale (species, sites or ecosystems). 
 
 
  
WG 24 Annual Reports  Appendix 3 
98  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
Activity 3: Report on aquatic animal health  (K. Amos) 
Mr. Amos reviewed the TOR for Activity 3 and provided a brief summary of the reports received from PICES 
member countries. In general, most member countries have a good understanding of diseases in cultured 
animals but limited information or research activities related to the understanding disease in wild populations. 
He noted that from the U.S. perspective, a major question was whether pathogens shed from aquaculture have 
negative impacts on wild hosts and the ecosystem.  He proposed that the Office International des Épizooties 
(OIE) guidelines related to aquatic animal health be used as a starting point for the Group. It was questioned 
whether all member countries subscribed to, or were members of, the OIE.  Several group members were 
unfamiliar with the OIE. However, examination of the OIE website revealed that all member countries are part 
of the OIE.  Dr. Abo noted that participation in the OIE was very important to Japan.  He felt that the limited 
number of responses from Japan was, in part, due to scientists feeling that the information requested for Japan 
by the Working Group could be accessed through the OIE.  Dr. Johnson noted that not all diseases are listed 
under the OIE and that there may important diseases WG 24 should consider which are not covered.  
 
It was noted that PICES member countries have different interests with respect to diseases of concern and host 
species.  Countries also vary widely in their research and diagnostic capacity, and the magnitude of disease 
monitoring in both cultured and wild populations.  For example, Dr. Gavrilova stated that other than 
information on parasites of wild fish and bacterial pathogens of sea cucumbers, Russia has limited data on 
disease.  This is in comparison to several other countries which have regional or national programs in Aquatic 
Animal Health. Dr. Johnson suggested taking a more ecosystem-based approach, possibly focusing on model 
pathogens for study.  Mr. Gillespie suggested that the Group should consider following the earlier suggestion 
of studying functional groups (e.g., specific types of pathogens such as gram negative bacteria) rather than 
specific species.  There was also a suggestion that the WG 24 needed to better understand bilateral agreements 
between PICES member countries that are related to the Working Group’s mandate.  This would help to 
develop and refine the TOR.   
 
Actions:  
 Mr. Amos will forward the URL for the OIE website and confirm with members whether they agree that 
this is a good starting point for the Group. 
 Mr. Amos will send a request to Working Group members to provide information on pathogens of concern 
that they feel would be suitable for study.  These could be of concern for either farmed or wild hosts or 
both.         
 
Ex-officio membership 
Dr. Bychkov provided the group with information on membership within working groups.  He noted that many 
issues facing the Pacific Ocean are not unique to the Pacific and the expertise of importance to PICES 
activities may be found outside of member countries.  He explained ex-officio membership on committees and 
the procedures that need to be followed to bring in ex-officio members.  As of April 2009 there will be an 
option to have ex-officio members from non-member countries or international organizations. He also 
mentioned that scientists from member countries can be asked to sit as observers by the working group. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 5 
Next Steps 
 
Concern was expressed that there had not been sufficient time set aside for the first meeting of this Working 
Group. Following discussion of the length of time for the next Working Group meeting, the following was 
decided upon.   
 
Decision:  To request a 1½-day Working Group business meeting to be held in advance of the PICES 2010 
Annual Meeting.  
 
Appendix 3 WG 24 Annual Reports  
PICES Scientific Report No. 44   99 
WG 24 also discussed the possibility and logistics of a field trip for members after the next Working Group 
business meeting.     
 
Action:  Co-chairs will examine the possibility of a field trip for the Working Group to be held before or after 
the next WG 24 meeting at PICES-2010.  Sources of funding to support a field trip will have to be explored.  
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 6 
Relationship with international organizations 
 
WG 24 discussed possible relationships with ICES working groups. There was also some discussion of a 
possible of a joint meeting with ICES working groups to be held after the next world aquaculture meeting.  
Due to the short time frame it was decided that the group would not attempt to develop a joint meeting. 
 
Action:  Dr. Black (a member of ICES) will provide information on ICES activities related to Activity 2.  
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 7 
Proposal for a workshop/Topic Session at PICES-2010 
 
The Group discussed the possibility of a workshop and/or session for the next PICES Annual Meeting in 
Portland, U.S.A., and felt that it was premature to propose a workshop or Topic Session. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 8 
Other business 
 
Following a series of discussions the following action items and decisions were agreed upon. 
 
Actions:  
 Dr. Johnson will circulate a copy of the minutes of the working group members for comments.  Corrected 
minutes will be circulated to the working group members.  
 Mr. Amos will send a reminder to all members responsible for action items within 2 weeks after the end of 
meeting. 
 All members to provide extra information and comments via email to the activity leaders (as soon as 
possible) but welcome throughout the year.

Interactions between aquaculture and marine eco-systems

(Korea)  
 
Background  
 
Open-water marine aquaculture has ongoing interactions with its surrounding environment. Some of these 
interactions have the potential to cause negative and positive effects on the other. For example, pathogens may 
be transmitted from wild reservoirs to cultured animals and vice versa, with the consequence of disease and 
mortality. Another example is the dispersal of nutrients from a farm site which in some instances negatively 
impacts the benthos while in other areas may enhance a nutrient-deficient marine zone or contribute to the 
culture of another aquatic species. Also, changing marine environments, including those impacted by global 
warming and ocean acidification, have the potential to affect these ecosystem interactions so as to investigate 
the culture of new farmed species - species that may perform better in altered environments. The PICES 
Working Group on Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture (WG-EIMA; WG 24) has been charged 
with evaluating existing and potentially new interactions and to develop models that assess the risk of these 
interactions to include escapes of farmed marine animals (considerations for genetics, competition, and 
pathogen transfer), discharge of effluent from culture facilities, use of non-native species in culture, and the 
exchange of pathogens between farmed and wild aquatic animals. Major goals of this workshop included:  
1) discussion of tools and models currently used by member countries to assess types of interactions and risks 
posed by them; 2) developing consensus on aquaculture technologies and indicators of interactions that will be 
used in completing the terms of reference and preparing the final report of WG-EIMA to include species and 
methods of culture; and 3) identifying the process by which the work will be carried out under the terms of 
reference.

REPORT OF WORKING GROUP 24 ON 
ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTIONS OF MARINE AQUACULTURE 
 
 
The Working Group on Environmental Interactions of Marine Aquaculture (hereafter WG 24) held its second 
meeting on October 24, 2010 in Portland Oregon, under Co-Chairmen Dr. Katsuyuki Abo (Japan), Dr. Brett 
Dumbauld (U.S.A.), and Ms. Ingrid Burgetz (Canada).  The list of participants and the meeting’s agenda can 
be found in WG-24 Endnotes 1 and 2. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 1 
Welcome and introductions 
 
Ms. Ingrid Burgetz provided welcome remarks which were followed by round table introductions.  WG 24 
members from Canada, Japan, Korea, Russia, the United States and were present.  Observers from Canada, 
China, and Russia and also participated in the meeting.  The agenda was reviewed; no comments or 
modifications were made. 
 
The ability of WG 24 to re-define priorities within the overall Working Group (WG) Terms of Reference 
(TOR), and linking the activities to broader PICES activities was discussed.  It was noted that the WG can 
select priorities based on interest and expertise of the members, and that these priorities would then be 
presented to the two parent Committees (MEQ and FIS) for approval.  As this is the last year of WG 24’s 
mandate, it was emphasized that the WG needs to demonstrate how marine aquaculture fits within PICES and 
the FUTURE program.  Dr. Toyomitsu Horii (Japan) reported that he had attended the inter-sessional 
FUTURE workshop in Seoul, Korea (August 16–18, 2010) on behalf of the WG.  There is a good fit for WG 
24 within the FUTURE program, particularly in areas such as management of coastal resources and climate 
change. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 2 
Review of TOR activities from 2009-2010 and proposals for action items for 2010 
 
Discussion of list of marine aquaculture–environment interactions 
Through the circulation of documents via e-mail over the past few months, the WG 24 has agreed on 
categorizing the types of marine aquaculture and environment interactions.  The WG discussed this 
categorization and as a result of this discussion the following modified list of interactions (separation of release 
of nutrients, non-cultured organisms and organic materials) are: 
 Pest and pathogen interactions/management 
 Benthic habitat interactions/alterations 
 Chemical release 
 Genetic interactions 
 Alteration in nutrients/harmful algal blooms/eutrophication 
 Release of non-cultured organisms  
 Release of organic materials 
 Effect of noise 
 Alteration in light 
 Marine mammal/bird interactions 
 
WG 24 Annual Reports  Appendix 3 
104  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
Dr. Jack Rensel (U.S.A.) suggested that WG 24 broaden environmental interactions to include harmful algal 
blooms and eutrophication.  He also noted that alteration in nutrients covers both water column and benthic 
impacts although it usually implies water column.  He stressed that an important contribution of the WG is the 
opportunity to compare and contrast approaches used in different member countries. 
 
As part of the process in developing the categories of marine aquaculture-environment interactions, WG 
members were requested to identify the most important interactions for their country.  Importance was defined 
as from an environmental, societal and/or economic perspective.  Participants at the WG meeting were asked 
to confirm and/or comment on their responses.  The following table identifies which interactions, by country, 
were identified as being most important. 
 
Canada Wild/cultured species interactions:   
 Disease interactions  
 Pest management 
China  Disease interactions: bidirectionality of disease transfer; diseases 
impacting shrimp production are of particular importance. 
 Genetic interactions 
Japan  Pest and pathogen management 
 Benthic interactions/ 
 Alteration in nutrients 
Korea  Pest and pathogen interactions 
 Genetic interactions 
 Benthic habitat interactions 
 Alteration in nutrients 
Russia Wild/cultured species interactions: 
 Alteration of nutrients/pollution 
 Disease interactions 
USA  Pest and pathogen interactions 
 Benthic habitat interactions 
 Alteration in nutrients 
 
Action Item:  Ms. Burgetz will revise the list based on discussions (revised above) and will re-circulate the list 
to WG 24 members.   
 
 
Discussion of Term of Reference 2:   Risk assessment  
TOR-2 Country reports 
Ms. Ingrid Burgetz and Dr. Jay Parsons (Canada) provided a brief update on the upcoming change in 
responsibility for the regulation of aquaculture in British Columbia, Canada.  The federal government, through 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans will be assuming responsibility for regulating aquaculture with the 
exception of issuing licenses for siting of new aquaculture operations, which will still be the responsibility of 
the Province of British Columbia. 
 
Dr. Galina Gavrilova (Russia) provided a brief country report indicating that the concept of risk and of risk 
assessment is not as popular in Russia as it is in Canada or the U.S.A.  Russia is not a member of the World 
Trade Organization, and aquaculture activities are regulated by laws of the Russian Federation.  The State 
standards and requests are issued by several ministries and agencies under the government of Russia 
(Federation Federal Fishery Agency, Ministry of Nature Protection and others).  There are several law-making 
documents that regulate environmental quality and habitat alteration control for safety of seafood. The primary 
documents are: (1) List of maximal permissible concentrations for fisheries grounds; and (2) Federal sanitary 
Appendix 3 WG 24 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 44  105 
norms and rules.  In these documents the federal norms for toxic substances, heavy metals, organic pollutants 
and others have been established. 
 
Dr. Brett Dumbauld (U.S.A.) provided information on recent changes in US shellfish aquaculture regulations.  
The US Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for permitting shellfish aquaculture and recently issued a new 
nation-wide permit with regional administration and review.  The new regulations are being phased in, and the 
nationwide permit covers existing aquaculture activities but does not cover new ones.  Approaches at the 
regional and state levels are still being worked out.  Some activities and species are regulated only under the 
national permit, while others will require additional information and different approaches, and there may be 
additional regulations at the state-level.  From the aquaculture industry perspective, these differences in 
regulations may pose problems. 
 
Dr. Jack Rensel provided an update on the expansion of fish farming in the State of Washington, which is 
expanding on Indian tribal lands along the Columbia River.  Specifically, the Colville Tribe, a self- governed 
tribe, has control and oversight of aquaculture activities rather than the State of Washington or the US 
Environmental Protection Agency.  Dr. Rensel is working to make sure the expansion is done with an eye to 
carrying capacity.  There is also expansion of aquaculture in the Juan de Fuca Strait, with large companies 
focusing on black cod and salmon.     
 
No other country comments were received. 
 
Ms. Ingrid Burgetz noted that each country takes a different approach to addressing the question of risks 
associated with aquaculture.  In preparation for the WG 24 meeting at PICES-2009 in Jeju, Korea, members 
were asked to identify the mechanisms and methods currently being used to assess environmental interactions 
of aquaculture.  The report, re-circulated prior to the WG meeting at PICES-2010, was proposed to form the 
basis of the WG’s activities under TOR-2.  The report is currently unfinished, and in need of revising by 
various member countries, due in part to some legislative changes.  It was noted that the original response from 
Korea was mistakenly omitted from the report circulated, and that Russia’s country report contains additional 
details to be included in this report. 
 
It was proposed that the report from Japan could be used as a template for revising country responses.  
Specifically, members will be asked to identify the legislative framework for aquaculture in their country, and 
the current status of research on environmental assessment of aquaculture.    
 
Action:   
 WG Co-Chairmen will re-send the report with the suggestion to members to consider using the same 
approach as Japan for answering the original question.    
 Each member will review their contribution to the TOR-2 report from 2009 and provide updates and 
revisions, as required, by December 15, 2010.   
 
(Originally the agreed on date was November 30, 2010; however, the Co-Chairmen have agreed that a 
minimum of 30 days is appropriate for WG members to be able to gather and submit the additional details).  
 
Note:  This report, once finalized, will be WG 24’s final activity under TOR-2. 
 
Discussion of Term of Reference 3:  Disease interactions 
Dr. Dumbauld introduced the term of reference for Activity 3, and provided a brief overview of the status of 
the 2009 report on TOR-3, and options for activities under TOR-3.  An example was whether the WG wants to 
look at new methods for disease diagnostics. 
 
WG 24 briefly discussed whether the 2009 report should be further refined, and what purpose a revised report 
would serve.  Dr. Lori Gustafson (U.S.A.) has agreed to take the lead role in coordinating a more 
WG 24 Annual Reports  Appendix 3 
106  PICES Scientific Report No. 44 
comprehensive report on disease interactions and suggested that one way of dividing up the TOR-3 would be 
to focus on the following different components: 
(1) describe current strategies re: surveillance, diagnostics and reporting; 
(2) describe methods to detect interactions (transmission between wild and farmed), including bringing 
together some information on what is going on in each member country; 
(3) describe emerging diseases of concern; 
(4) model the risks of emerging diseases – developing an approach to predicting the probability of disease 
occurring. 
 
Realistically, WG 24 is unlikely to be able to address each of these components, and it was suggested that the 
WG not focus on detection and modeling of risks of interactions.  The WG agreed in principle that the output 
should include an overview of diseases of aquaculture in the North Pacific, with different country inputs and 
provide an overall picture of where the disease research community as a whole might focus.  This report 
should be targeted as a review for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.  In addition to the existing WG 
members, a discussion on how to further engage experts in each of the member countries took place as 
additional expertise was agreed to be important to allow for a more comprehensive review. 
 
TOR-3 Country Reports 
Dr. Kong Jie (China, observer) provided an update on the on-farm use of diagnostic kits for viruses of 
aquaculture concern (i.e., white spot in shrimp culture), stating that although there are now 8 to 10 viruses that 
can be diagnosed with these kits that have been under development in China for a number of years, farmers do 
not like to use the kits as they do not assist in addressing the disease, only identifying it. 
 
Dr. Gavrilova noted that diseases of aquaculture animals are a great problem in Russia, as in other countries.  
In Russia, there are Handbooks for the regulation of aquaculture operations in fresh water. However, until 
recently a special control agency for marine aquaculture products did not exist.  Disease monitoring of marine 
aquaculture products is conducted only by research institutes. These results are then presented to the Federal 
Fishery Agency.  The first results of research investigations in experimental hatcheries were presented in 
Russia’s country 2009 report. 
 
Dr. Myoung Ae Park (Korea) noted that the focus in Korea is diagnostics: surveys on fish farms and 
discussions with fish farmers about diagnostic methods and treatment options such as the use of vaccines, etc. 
Work is also focusing on prevention, through the development of vaccines (including viral and bacterial 
disease vaccines) and chemical approaches.  OIE listed diseases are important. 
 
Dr. Abo provided a brief introduction of the Japanese situation.  Japanese members of the WG will provide 
information on diseases, diagnostics and vaccines.  
 
Dr. Stewart Johnson (Canada) provided an overview of aquaculture-related disease and health research and 
scientific efforts in Canada, which are a combined effort between government, universities, First Nations and 
diagnostic laboratories.  Diseases and pests of concern include sea lice, IHNV, Renibacterium, and Aeromonas.  
He noted the importance of understanding both the host biology and reaction and the information about 
pathogens of concern  – where they occur, their natural prevalence in wild populations, survival outside of 
hosts, etc.  He then provided a more detailed overview of the types of research that are being undertaken on sea 
lice and IHNV as examples, as well as research on developing new tools to assess the health of mussels and 
littleneck clams.   
 
Action:  
 WG members who work on disease will meet on October 25, 2010 to develop a draft Table of Contents for 
TOR-3 and to discuss how to move forward on this activity.  The developed draft Table of Contents can be 
found in WG-24 Endnote 3. 
 A report, designed for submission to a peer-reviewed journal, will be developed, using the Table of 
Contents with draft country reports due to Dr. Lori Gustafson on April 1, 2010.

Country leads for this activity are:  Stewart Johnson (Canada); Valeriya Terekhova (Russia); Myoung Ae Park 
(Korea); Katsuyuki Abo (Japan); Lori Gustafson (U.S.A.).   
Note:  No country lead has been identified for China.  
 
Discussion of Term of Reference 1:  Modeling interactions 
Dr. Abo provided an overview of TOR-1.  He reviewed the 2009 report, including a summary of the types of 
culture methodologies used in each member country.  At the PICES-2009 it was decided that WG 24 would 
use functional groups rather than individual species.  The table was modified to summarize by functional 
groups (i.e., netpen carnivorous fish, long line/raft filter feeders, sowing culture filter feeders, detritus feeders).   
 
Similar to the activities that will be undertaken for TOR-3, a proposal had been sent to WG 24 members so 
that the WG could build on presentations given at the PICES-2008 and -2009 mariculture sessions that focused 
on benthic interactions.  This proposal was discussed at length, and the consensus was that benthic interactions 
are too narrow for a focus.  The WG agreed that the focus for a literature review and analysis under TOR-1 
will be on: 
Short- and long-term effects on the near and far-field benthic environment, including physical and chemical 
changes and rates of recovery.  This will include beneficial as well as negative effects. 
 
It was determined that by focusing efforts on near and far-field interactions, this would be sufficiently 
comprehensive for all member countries to contribute to the review.  Additionally, it was noted that the review 
should include an analysis of algal culture, which has both positive and negative effects in the near and far-
field.  Dr. Jie described new work to look at integrated aquaculture to consider the economics as well as 
ecological factors.  He thought that chemical and other factors are likely being considered in this research.       
 
Action:   
 WG members interested in TOR-1 will meet on October 25, 2010 to develop the Table of Contents (see 
WG-24 Endnote 4) for a report addressing the focal statement, and to finalize a plan to move this activity 
forwards.  
 The report on near and far-field interactions will be developed by WG members identified as leads (see 
below), using the Table of Contents (see WG-24 Endnote 4) with draft country reports to be submitted to 
Dr. Abo on April 1, 2010. 
 
Country leads for this activity are:  Ingrid Burgetz (Canada); Galina Gavrilova (Russia); Hung Jeong Lim 
(Korea); Katsuyuki Abo (Japan); Brett Dumbauld (U.S.A.).   
 
Note:  No country lead has been identified for China.  
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 3 
Proposal for a Topic Session at PICES-2011 
 
A proposal for a scientific Topic Session at the upcoming PICES meeting in Khabarovsk, Russia in 2011 was 
developed (WG 24 Endnote 5).  Through discussions, WG 24 decided that the inclusion of socio-economic 
considerations related to marine aquaculture and environment interactions would be valuable and aligns with 
the FUTURE program.  The WG requested a full day for the session, and support for 2 invited speakers.   
 
WG 24 discussed the possibility of using the Topic Session as the basis for putting together a special 
publication in the new journal Aquaculture Environment Interactions.  It was decided that should the proposal 
for a Topic Session be accepted, then the WG would again initiate this discussion, as it would help to inform 
who should be approached as invited speakers as well as other researchers whose presentations and input 
would be valuable to the session.  Drs. Gavrilova, Dumbauld, and Abo agreed to be co-convenors and lead this 
activity.

AGENDA ITEM 4 
Review of action items and deliverables for 2010–2011 
 
Ms. Burgetz reviewed the action items and deliverables for 2010–2011 and emphasized that this was the last 
year of WG 24 under the current mandate, and that it is very important that the WG produce the agreed-on 
reports under all three TOR.  She emphasized the need to stick to the April 1, 2011 deadline for submitting 
country reports because the activity leads and WG Co-Chairmen will then require time to analyze the reports 
and write the report’s introduction and the analysis and discussion sections.  The report will then be circulated 
to the WG members at the end of August 2011 for their review and comments in September and October 2011, 
prior to the WG meeting at PICES-2011.    
 
In addition to developing and finalizing the reports on each TOR, over the next year WG 24 will need to 
consider what recommendations they would like to put forward to the two parent Committees, MEQ and FIS, 
for future mariculture-related activities for PICES, including Topic Sessions, requesting that the TOR of WG 
24 be re-evaluated and extended, or proposing TOR for a new working group. 
 
The WG meeting at PICES-2011 will need to focus on finalizing the reports, consider any proposals for 
mariculture-related topic sessions or workshops for PICES-2012 and discuss and finalize any 
recommendations for future PICES work on mariculture that can be proposed to the MEQ and FIS committees.

Pathogens of aquatic animals: Detection, diagnosis and risks of interactions between  
wild and farmed populations in PICES member countries 
 
1. Executive Summary 
2. Introduction   
3. Status Review by Country 
Each country will submit a document reviewing some or all of the following topics.  If possible countries will 
identify key concerns, critical information sources and primary organizations and/or regulations directing 
aquatic animal health.  However, it is not expected that these reviews will be exhaustive.  Rather, countries 
may choose to highlight select diseases, diagnostics or epidemiologic methods of regional importance and/or 
provide a foundation or direction for future research.   
3.1 Topics 
3.1.1 Pathogens of importance to wild and cultured aquatic animals by country 
 May include information on invertebrates and/or finfish  
 May include diseases of importance as defined by the OIE, as well as diseases of regional or 
country significance. 
 May consider economic and/or ecological significance. 
3.1.2 Overview of the regulations/rules regarding aquatic animal health 
 Identification of departments or agencies involved in the regulation and/or control of aquatic 
animal diseases 
 Brief review of the regulatory environment 
3.1.3 Overview of national and/or regional programs related to the diagnosis and control of 
diseases of aquatic animals 
 Identification of laboratories/departments etc. that are actively involved in disease diagnostics 
and/or research related to diagnostic test development 
3.1.4 Overview of the methods used for the identification and detection of pathogens of concern 
 To include diagnostic tests approved for regulatory use as well as those that are used within 
the research community. 
3.1.5 Overview of perceived or realized risks associated with the transfer of pathogens between 
wild and farmed hosts 
 This may include the introduction of pathogens resulting from the translocation or natural 
migration of animals from aquaculture or wild populations.   
 This could include statistical methods, research activities or disease spread models used to 
study the potential transfer of pathogens. 
 This could include examples or case studies of presumed disease transmission between 
aquaculture and wild populations. 
 This could also include steps taken to reduce risk of transmission between aquaculture and 
wild populations. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The conclusion will summarize progress and gaps in the study of pathogen transfer between aquaculture and 
wild aquatic animal populations.  Suggestions may include future conference sessions, new working group 
objectives, or peer-reviewed publications considering the need for harmonization or further development of 
research and surveillance methods.

Proposal for a 1-day MEQ/FIS Topic Session at PICES-2011 on 
“Identification and characterization of environmental interactions of marine aquaculture  
in the North Pacific” 
 
Convenors:  Galina Gavrilova; Brett Dumbauld; Katsuyuki Abo 
 
Marine aquaculture is an important economic and social activity within PICES member countries.  To ensure 
development of aquaculture is environmentally and economically sustainable we need to: 1) improve our 
understanding of interactions between marine aquaculture and the environment (including wild stocks of plants 
and animals), 2) develop methods to study and/or predict such interactions, and 3) devise ways to reduce 
negative impacts on the environment.  To this end the PICES Working Group on Environmental Interactions 
of Marine Aquaculture (WG 24) has begun to characterize the nature of these interactions with a focus on the 
benthic environment and aquatic animal health.   To align with the activities of the WG 24 we propose to 
solicit papers in the following areas for this scientific session:  
 
1. identification and characterization of marine aquaculture-environmental interactions; 
2. development of tools to identify and study such interactions; and 
3. social science research related to aquaculture interactions with the marine environment.   
 
Duration: full day 
A request was made for financial support for two invited speakers.

FIS/MEQ Topic Session (S7) 
Economic relation between marine aquaculture and wild capture fisheries 
 
Co-Convenors: Ingrid Burgetz (Canada), Dohoon Kim (Korea), Minling Pan (U.S.A.) and Qingyin Wang 
(China) 
 
 
Background 
 
Considering the growing role of marine aquaculture in both seafood production and consumption as well as the 
close relationship between marine aquaculture and wild ocean capture fisheries, this session focused on the 
economic relationships of marine aquaculture to capture fisheries.  Such relationships include (1) marine 
aquaculture products as a substitute and/or complement for wild caught products owing to consumer 
preference, price, and availability; (2) the synergies between aquaculture and fishing (use of fish processing 
trimmings, resilient coastal communities and maintaining working waterfronts), and (3) economic 
considerations regarding potential environmental effects (positive and negative), interactions between capture 
fisheries and marine aquaculture (e.g., feed inputs in marine aquaculture derived from captured fisheries, 
aquaculture stock enhancement, and aquaculture structures as fish aggregating devices). 
 
Summary of Presentations 
 
This session was the first topic session on economics and social science at a PICES Annual Meeting.  The past 
activities of PICES had mainly focused on physical and biological sciences, such as ecology, ecosystems, 
fisheries, oceanography, and biogeochemistry, etc.  Topic session S7 was developed in response to the new 
FUTURE science program endeavors to provide a greater role for social and economic scientists in PICES.  It 
was an important step toward enhancing research and management of marine living resources from a socio-
economic perspective. 
 
The session attracted broad participation of economists and experts from all the PICES member counties.  This 
session consisted of 12 oral presentations, including 7 invited papers.  The lead convenor, Minling Pan 
(U.S.A.), gave a brief introduction on the background and objectives of the topic session in the opening.  The 
keynote speaker, Michael Rubino (U.S.A.), manager of the NOAA Aquaculture Program, outlined the 
economic issues and research needs raised by the potential expansion of domestic marine aquaculture, and in 
particular, the potential economic effects of marine aquaculture on capture fisheries.  Dr. Rubino indicated that 
the economic ramifications of expanding aquaculture in the United States, along with environmental and food 
safety concerns, are the subject of much debate and widely differing views.  Aquaculture may be a way to 
substantially increase domestic seafood production.  Hatchery-based stock replenishment may be a way to 
restore depleted commercial and recreational fisheries.  Associated economic benefits of these aquaculture 
activities may include the creation of jobs from coastal communities to the agricultural heartland, maintenance 
of working waterfronts, and synergies with commercial fishing such as use of fish processing trimmings.  But 
concerns have been raised that domestic aquaculture may compete with domestic wild fisheries depressing 
prices for wild caught fish.  Additional concerns include the economic consequences of potential 
environmental and social effects of aquaculture on wild capture fisheries and traditional fishing communities. 
 
Other contributed papers reported case studies that discussed economic relations between marine aquaculture 
and wild capture fisheries from different aspects or demonstrated analytical models to measure the 
linkage/trade-off between these two.  For example, Di Jin (U.S.A.) presented an integrated economic-
ecological model developed for coastal New England by incorporating an aquaculture sector in the CGE model 
and by examining the forage fish and aquaculture link in a marine food web context.  Yajie Liu (Norway) 
presented an analytical framework that aims to explore the ecological and economic impacts of genetic 
Appendix 3 WG 24 Annual Reports

interaction between farmed and wild salmon over generations.  The model was constructed based on the 
Atlantic salmon fishery and salmon farming in Norway.  Hisashi Kurokura (Japan) illustrated how the 
development of the aquaculture industry (tuna culture) had influenced the consumer preference and 
consumption behaviors by cultured tuna in Japan.  Kelly Davidson (U.S.A.) presented a study on consumer 
preferences for farm-raised versus wild-caught fish in Hawaii.  Seong-Kwae Park (Korea) presented the 
historical trends of wild caught fish and farmed (marine) fish consumption in Korea.  His study predicted that 
farmed fish would replace wild fish gradually, not rapidly, over time.  Chen Sun (China) addressed the 
influence of marine aquaculture on the fishery industry supply chain and consumption in China.  Both studies 
noticed that the economic trade-off between costs of sacrificing marine environmental quality and benefits 
from marine culture aquaculture expansion.

Secretariat.  
 
The Co-Chairs and Dr. Johnson will compile and edit the final version of the WG 24 report. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 7 
Summary of Working Group activities and report to Committees 
 
A summary of Working Group activities over the past year was reported by Dr. Abo to the FIS and MEQ 
parent committee meetings at PICES-2011. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 8 
Discussion on future activity of mariculture issues within PICES 
 
Members of the Working Group were in agreement that aquaculture remains an important topic for PICES and 
the FUTURE Program.  Dr. Galina Gavrilova (Russia) suggested the extension of WG 24 for 1 year to allow 
us to complete the final report and to develop a proposal for a study group.  Upon further discussion, the Group 
consensus was that, following approval of the United States, an application for a study group related to 
aquaculture would be put forward at the 2012 PICES Annual Meeting.  The focus of this study group and its 
Terms of Reference will be developed over the next year, taking into consideration the direction of Working 
Group on Development of Ecosystem Indicators to Characterize Ecosystem Responses to Multiple Stressors 
(WG 28) and other FUTURE activities. Members of WG 24 and others will contribute to this activity. 
 
Action Item: WG 24 members will be contacted to determine whether they are in favor of developing a study 
group proposal for consideration at the PICES-2012. Members will be requested to provide suggestions from 
which Terms of Reference and the objectives of such a study group can be developed.

Background 
 
Marine aquaculture is an important economic and social activity within PICES member countries. To ensure 
that development of aquaculture is environmentally and economically sustainable we need to: 1) improve our 
understanding of interactions between marine aquaculture and the environment (including wild stocks of plants 
and animals, 2) develop methods to study and/or predict such interactions, and 3) devise ways to reduce 
negative impacts on the environment. To this end the PICES Working Group on Environmental Interactions of 
Marine Aquaculture has begun to characterize the nature of these interactions with a focus on the benthic 
environment and aquatic animal health. To align with the activities, papers for this session are solicited in the 
following areas: 1) identification and characterization of marine aquaculture-environmental interactions;  
2) development of tools to identify and study such interactions; and 3) social science research related to 
aquaculture interactions with the marine environment.  
 
Summary of Presentations 
 
The presentations covered a variety of applications of marine aquaculture in PICES countries. There were 2 
invited oral presentations, 6 oral presentations and 3 posters prepared for this session from Canada, China, 
Japan, Russia and USA.  Two oral presentations were cancelled but one alternative oral presentation was 
presented by Dr. Hasegawa. About 50 people participated in the topic session.  
 
The invited speaker, Dr. Tomoko Sakami (Fisheries Research Agency, Japan) started the session by describing 
an attempt to assess aquaculture environments using microbial communities in bottom sediments. She 
suggested sedimentary microbe genomic information is a prospective parameter to assess the environments 
influenced by fish aquaculture (Abstract S6-7567). Another invited speaker, Dr. Shuanglin Dong introduced 
integrated aquaculture in China. He described the history, ecological rationales, classification and development 
of integrated aquaculture in China (Abstract S6-7755).   
 
Dr. Katsuyuki Abo summarized research on environmental interactions of marine aquaculture in Japan. He 
reviewed studies on impacts of marine aquaculture on benthic environments to identify and characterize the 
environmental interaction of marine aquaculture in Japan (Abstract S6-7736). Due to visa application trouble, 
Dr. Brett Dumbauld was unable to attend the topic session so an alternative presentation was given by Dr. 
Natsuki Hasegawa. He discussed the use of aquaculture species for monitoring change in coastal ecosystems 
and fisheries productions. He suggested bivalves and seaweed species for aquaculture as potential indicators of 
coastal ecosystem production (Abstract S6-7665-2; provided as Endnote 1). Dr. Stewart Johnson presented an 
overview of interactions between wild and farmed salmonids in Southern British Columbia. He summarized 
surveys of pathogens in wild salmonids, laboratory studies on pathogens and hosts, improved diagnostic 
methods and the use of physical oceanographic models to predict pathogen movements within the environment 
(Abstract S6-7861). The influence of environmental factors on hanging plantations for Laminaria kelp was 
presented by Dr. Tatiana Krupnova (Abstract S6-7858). Dr. Sei-Ichi Saitoh discussed the use of GIS-based 
WG 24 Annual Reports   Appendix 3

spatial models to select Japanese kelp aquaculture sites in the Southwestern Hokkaido (Abstract S6-7580).  
 
Dr. Chunjiang Guan presented a poster on absorption of carbon and nitrogen by culturing Sargassum 
thunbergii in coastal waters.  He suggested Sargassum thunbergii culture played an important role in restoring 
eutrophied sea waters and in absorbing CO

Linking changes in ecosystem and fisheries production with environmental factors which contribute to 
numerical models that predict that change is particularly difficult in coastal areas. Since there are more diverse 
organisms, landscapes, and interactions in coastal areas than those in offshore areas, change was not directly 
predicted by numerical models. Bivalves and seaweed species for aquaculture are potential indicators of 
coastal ecosystem production, because these primary consumers and producers are sensitive to environmental 
changes especially at early stages. However, changes in catch or landings do not reflect change in productivity 
and there might not be enough objective and scientific data on parameters like number and survival rate to 
estimate production in Japanese aquaculture using catch or landings alone.  Therefore constructing a broad 
monitoring system of these productivity indices and other characteristics, which could be routinely collected 
with aquaculture, would be useful for analyzing catch data and for identifying change. Accumulation of these 
short-term data would effectively contribute to predicting mid and long term change in coastal ecosystem and 
fisheries production based on predictive environmental models.

A New PICES Working Group Holds Workshop and Meeting in Jeju Island 
 
by Kevin Amos and Katsuyuki Abo 
 
The newly formed PICES Working Group on Environmental 
Interactions of Marine Aquaculture (WGEIMA; WG 24) 
convened its inaugural meeting and sponsored a workshop 
at the 2009 PICES Annual Meeting held in October, in 
Jeju, Korea.  This Working Group operates under the 
auspices of the Marine Environmental Quality (MEQ) and 
Fishery Science (FIS) Committees. 
 
As marine aquaculture evolves around the world, 
significant fish and shellfish culture activities are occurring 
in PICES member countries.  Considering that the potential 
exists for interactions to occur between culture facilities 
and the surrounding ecosystems, WGEIMA has embarked 
on an effort to better understand these interactions and 
assess their risk.  Our primary mission is to develop 
standard methods and tools to assess and compare the 
environmental interactions and characteristics of existing 
and planned marine aquaculture activities in PICES 
member countries.  The following action plan (terms of 
reference) were approved at the formation of WGEIMA: 
1. Evaluate approaches currently being used in PICES 
member countries to assess and model the interactions 
of aquaculture operations with surrounding environments.  
(This will involve conducting a comparative assessment 
of the methodologies, applications, and outputs of 
different approaches to assess finfish, shellfish, 
seaweed, and/or integrated multi-tropic aquaculture.) 
2. Review and evaluate current risk assessment methods 
used to assess environmental interactions of 
aquaculture and determine what, if anything, should be 
changed for their application in PICES member 
countries to reflect ecosystem-specific aspects.  
Following the review and assessment, identify 
appropriate case studies to compare results among 
countries in the PICES region.  (This will be achieved 
by holding a workshop in the second or third year to 
compare and discuss possible standardization of 
methodologies and the selection of potential case 
studies for assessment with a standardized approach.  
Functions and responsibilities of the sub-group 
undertaking this task will be similar to the ICES 
Working Group on Environmental Interactions of 
Mariculture, so the feasibility of holding a joint 
meeting with this group will be explored.) 
3. Assess methods to detect, identify, evaluate and report 
on infectious disease events and potential interactions 
between wild and farmed marine animals.  If 
appropriate, develop a recommended standardized 
approach for detection/evaluation/reporting from wild 
and cultured populations.  The focus of this activity 
will be on OIE-notifiable diseases and other infectious 
diseases of regional/economic importance.  (This will 
involve discussing and documenting new and 
emerging infectious diseases in the PICES region, 
methods for their detection, and developing models to 
conduct risk assessments of their potential impacts on 
both endemic wild and farmed species.  Functions and 
responsibilities of the sub-group undertaking this task 
will be similar to the ICES Working Group on 
Pathology and Diseases of Marine Organisms, so the 
feasibility to hold a joint meeting will be explored.) 
 
On October 24, WGEIMA held it first major activity – a 
workshop on “Interactions between aquaculture and marine 
ecosystems” co-convened by Katsuyuki Abo (Japan), Kevin 
Amos (U.S.A.), Galina Gavrilova (Russia) and Hyun Jeong 
Lim (Korea).  The major objective of the workshop was to 
discuss tools and models currently used by PICES member 
countries to evaluate interactions of marine aquaculture and 
assess the risks of these interactions.  Three noted experts 
were invited to the workshop to share with us their models 
and research.  Dr. Dario Stucchi (Fisheries and Oceans 
Canada) has been studying how currents, tides, and other 
oceanographic conditions disperse sea lice larvae from 
salmon farms to the marine ecosystems in the Broughton 
Archipelago, British Columbia, Canada.  There is concern 
that lice from salmon farms may be infecting, and 
subsequently impacting, wild salmon populations, and  
Dr. Stucchi’s models will be utilized in helping to better 
understand this potential pathogen interaction. 
 
The fate of effluent and nutrients from marine farms is the 
focus of AquaModel developed by Dr. Jack Rensel (Rensel 
Associates Aquatic Sciences, U.S.A.).  Like Dr. Stucchi’s 
models, his model explores physical and chemical 
oceanographic phenomena to determine if and how 
effluents from fish farms may interact with marine 
ecosystems.  His data suggest that improperly sited farms 
may have negative impacts while properly sited farms have 
no impact or possible benefits on nutrient-poor ecosystems. 
 
Dr. Tamiji Yamamoto (Hiroshima University, Japan) has 
been focusing on effects of culture density on the growth 
and fecal production of the oyster Crassostrea gigas in 
Hiroshima Bay.  His model expresses physiological 
processes of the oyster as well as physical and chemical 
oceanographic phenomena.  His study has suggested the 
appropriate cultivation density under the environmental 
conditions of the Bay. 
 
Many other speakers presented interesting research on 
various aspects of marine aquaculture, including possible 
interactions of effluents, pathogens, and genetics.  Brief 
information on all presentations can be found in the Book

After the successful workshop, WGEIMA held a half-day 
meeting to discuss the next steps to be taken.  In the near 
term, we will attempt to reach consensus on 
types/methodologies of aquaculture that have commonality 
in all PICES member countries and then start to identify 
and develop risk assessments associated with these 
technologies.  For more details on the meeting please refer 
to the 2009 PICES Annual Report.  Next time, WGEIMA 
will meet in conjunction with the 2010 PICES Annual 
Meeting (Portland, U.S.A.), but there will be much 
interaction among the Working Group members before we 
gather together again in Portland. 
Our activities in Jeju were capped off by an excellent field 
trip hosted by Korea and organized by Dr. Hyun Jeong 
Lim.  This half-day trip took us first to a flounder 
aquaculture farm operated by Bibong Aquaculture.  The 
flounder were being raised in land-based concrete tanks 
with seawater being pumped through volcanic rock 
immediately adjacent to the ocean.  Our next stop was an 
abalone farm operated by Jeil Hatchery.  Like the flounder 
farm, this farm was utilizing pumped seawater into land-
based tanks.  The abalone are fed kelp and take 3 to 4 years 
to reach market size.  Our final stop was a visit to a Korean 
Culture Park that exhibited the various life styles, 
dwellings, and historic farming techniques utilized by the 
Korean natives in the countryside.  All participants greatly 
enjoyed the trip – thanks Dr. Lim!!!
