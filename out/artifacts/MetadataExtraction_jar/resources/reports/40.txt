Two examples of member activities applied to Working Group 20’s first and third terms of reference: 
 i) to analyse and evaluate climate change projections for the North Pacific and its marginal seas based on 
predictions from the latest global and regional models submitted to the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change for their 4th Assessment Report, and iii) to facilitate the development of higher-resolution 
regional ocean and coupled atmosphere-ocean models that are forced by, and take their boundary conditions 
from, IPCC global or regional models.  Top: A regional ecosystem model version of COCO-NEMURO 
applied to the lower trophic level marine ecosystem simulating the timing of maximum chlorophyll 
concentration (dark blue is January, red is June) in the spring bloom in the Kuroshio-Oyashio system. 
(See Yamanaka et al. for more details.)  Bottom: A Northeast Pacific regional climate model nested in the 
CCSM global climate model relative to the CCSM model showing sea surface temperature (dark blue is  
–3.0°C and red is +3.0°) and wind anomalies (maximum is approximately 1.5 m/s) in August. (See 
Curchitser et al. for more details.)

1 Introduction 
 
PICES Working Group on Evaluations of Climate 
Change Predictions (WG 20) was established in 
October 2005 at the PICES 2005 Annual Meeting in 
Vladivostok, Russia.  As previous climate studies 
within PICES had generally been retrospective, it was 
felt that the upcoming 2007 release of the 4th 
Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC), and the global climate model 
(GCM) projections associated with it, could provide a 
credible set of forecasts for forward-looking 
ecosystem studies in the North Pacific.  Accordingly, 
the motivation for creating the Working Group was to 
evaluate these IPCC projections and, where possible, 
downscale them to sufficiently fine spatial scales so 
that they would be useful for continental shelf and 
coastal ecosystem studies.  Though WG 20 was 
originally assigned a 3-year term, this was extended to 
4 years at the PICES 2009 Annual Meeting in order to 
allow collaborations with the newly created 
PICES/ICES Working Group on Climate Change 
Impacts on Fish and Shellfish. The Physical 
Oceanography and Climate (POC) Committee was the 
only parent committee of WG 20, and the 
Co-Chairmen of the Working Group were Michael 
Foreman and Yasuhiro Yamanaka. The Terms of 
Reference (TORs) and the membership of the 
Working Group can be found in Appendices 1 and 2. 
 
This report includes:  
• an executive summary which briefly outlines the 
achievements of the Working Group as applied to 
the TORs, and provides recommendations for 
future follow-up activities within PICES; 
• nine sections describing specific activities of WG 
20 members (and colleagues) directed at one or 
more of the TORs; the reports are arranged by 
PICES member country; 
• the working history of the Group (Appendix 5) 
and featured articles in PICES Press issues 
(Appendix 6). 
 
  
  
Section 2 Executive Summary and Recommendations  
PICES Scientific Report No. 40 3 
 
 
 
2 Executive Summary and Recommendations 
 
 
2.1 Summary of WG 20 Activities against Each of the Terms of Reference 
 
1. Analyse and evaluate climate change projections for the North Pacific and its marginal seas based on 
predictions from the latest global and regional models submitted to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) for their 4th Assessment Report. 
• Using results from the Canadian Earth System Model (Arora et al., 2009; Christian et al., 2010), 
Christian showed that in the 21st century the North Pacific will experience serious shoaling of the 
calcite and aragonite saturation horizons, with a variety of poorly understood biological impacts, and 
that the North Pacific will play a smaller role in the global ocean CO
2
 sink than in earlier centuries.  See 
section 3.1 for further details. 
• Merryfield et al. (2009) evaluated and examined future projections of global climate model (GCM) 
winds along the British Columbia continental shelf.  See section 3.2 for more details. 
• Hashioka and Yamanaka (2007) and Hashioka et al. (2009) analysed marine ecosystem changes 
resulting from coupling the Japanese GCM MIROC (version 3.2) to lower and higher trophic level 
models for the Kuroshio-Oyashio system.  See section 3.3 for more details. 
• Using simulations from GCMs submitted to the IPCC 4th Assessment Report, Jang et al. (2011) 
analysed and evaluated simulations and projections of the mixed layer depth (MLD) and its impact on 
primary production and timing of the spring bloom in the North Pacific Ocean.  See section 3.4 for 
further details. 
• Yeh et al. (2009) examined MLD changes in the equatorial tropical Pacific Ocean and their relation with 
El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) using the climate change projections from two IPCC GCMs.  See 
section 3.4 for further details. 
• Curchitser et al. (this report) coupled a 10-km resolution Northeast Pacific Ocean circulation model to 
the NCAR CCSM GCM and demonstrated both local and global changes resulting from better resolved 
dynamics in the California Current System.  See section 3.7 for more details. 
• Furtado et al. (2011) examined the major modes of North Pacific and tropical Pacific variability within 
GCMs used in the IPCC 4th Assessment Report.  See section 3.8 for more details. 
• Overland and Wang (2007) and Wang et al. (2010) evaluated GCMs for their fidelity in reproducing the 
Pacific Decadal Oscillation and then used a subset of models for examining future changes in North 
Pacific sea surface temperature (SST).  See section 3.9 for more details. 
• Wang and Overland (2009) evaluated GCMs for their accuracy in reproducing Arctic sea ice extent.  
See section 3.9 for more details. 
• Wang and Overland (this report) illustrated the assessment and culling of GCM projections with an 
example for SST and sea ice extent in the Bering Sea.  See section 3.9 for further details. 
 
2. Facilitate analyses of climate effects on marine ecosystems and ecosystem feedbacks to climate by, for 
example computing an ensemble of the IPCC model projections for the North Pacific and making these 
projections available to other PICES groups such as CFAME.  
• WG 20 members collaborated with the PICES Climate Forcing and Marine Ecosystem Task Team 
(CFAME) by: 
o Organizing joint workshops at three PICES Annual Meetings (2007–2009) and attending the 
CFAME workshop on “Linking and visualizing climate-forcing mechanisms and marine ecosystem 
changes:  A comparative approach” (April 2008, Honolulu, U.S.A.); 
o Co-authoring King et al. (2011). 
Executive Summary and Recommendations Section 2 
4  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
• WG 20 members collaborated with PICES/ICES Working Group on Climate Change Impacts on Fish 
and Shellfish (WGCCIFS) by: 
o Attending their meetings (Foreman and Yamanaka are WGCCIFS members); 
o Co-convening the session on “Downscaling variables from global models” at the International 
Symposium on Climate change effects on fish and fisheries (April 2010, Sendai, Japan); 
o Co-authoring papers with other members from the PICES community, for example, Ito et al. 
(2011). 
• Di Lorenzo et al. (2008) showed strong correlations between the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation 
(NPGO) and salinity, NO
3
, and Chl-a in the California Current; and salinity and NO
3
 along Line-P. 
• Di Lorenzo et al. (2010) showed that the low-frequency nature of the NPGO decadal climate mode 
originates from variability associated with the Central tropical Pacific Warming (CPW, a variation of 
ENSO) so that if projections of increased CPW frequency and magnitude are accurate (e.g., Yeh et al., 
2009), then increased NPGO variance and a change in the background state of the North Pacific and its 
ecosystems can be expected.  
• Hashioka and Yamanaka (2007) investigated the impacts the MIROC GCM climate projections on 
marine ecosystems in the Kuroshio-Oyashio system.  See section 3.3 for more details. 
• Navrotsky (this report) discussed both climate interactions on ecosystems, and ecosystem (especially 
phytoplankton) feedbacks to climate, from a general heat energy perspective.  See section 3.5 for more 
details. 
• Ustinova and Zuenko (this report) used possible climate projection scenarios to project marine 
ecosystem changes in the Far-Eastern Marginal Seas.  See section 3.6 for more details. 
 
3. Facilitate the development of higher-resolution regional ocean and coupled atmosphere-ocean models that 
are forced by, and take their boundary conditions from, IPCC global or regional models.  
• North Pacific Regional Climate Models (RCMs) that have been developed, or are under development, 
by WG 20 members and colleagues are: 
o the California shelf (Auad et al., 2006); 
o the British Columbia shelf (Foreman et al.; see section 3.2 in this report); 
o the Northeast Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea (Curchitser et al.; see section 3.7 in this report). It is 
important to note that, as this model has two-way coupling to the NCAR GCM, it is the most 
advanced of all the RCMs; 
o the Washington–Oregon shelf (Bond, Curchitser, Hermann; under development). 
 
4. Facilitate the development of local and regional data sets (e.g., SST, river flow, sea ice cover) by 
incorporating information from climate model projections as well as observations and historical re-analyses. 
• Foreman et al. (2011) filled gaps in the last decade of winds measured at weather buoys along the 
British Columbia continental shelf and performed trend analyses over upwelling and downwelling 
periods.  See section 3.2 for more details.  
• Morrison et al. (2011) developed a method for estimating total freshwater discharge along the British 
Columbia coast and used it to reconstruct time series over the last 40 years.  See section 3.2 for further 
details.  
• Ustinova and Zuenko assembled various data sets (e.g., sea ice extent, SST, air temperature, sea level 
pressure) associated with Far-Eastern Marginal Seas and performed analyses of low-frequency climate 
variability.  See section 3.6 for more details. 
• Wang updates and maintains the website http://www.beringclimate.noaa.gov/ in which projections from 
culled IPCC models are published for the east Bering Sea region. 
 
5. Ensure effective two-way communication with CLIVAR;  
• CLIVAR representatives gave presentations at several WG 20/POC Annual Meetings; 
• CLIVAR co-sponsored a workshop on “Exploring the predictability and mechanisms of Pacific low 
frequency variability beyond inter-annual time scales” at the PICES 2009 Annual Meeting (October, 
2009, Jeju, Korea); 
Section 2 Executive Summary and Recommendations  
PICES Scientific Report No. 40 5 
• Dr. Toshio Suga, member of the CLIVAR Pacific Panel, and a representative of CLIVAR at the PICES 
2010 Annual Meeting (October 2010, Portland, U.S.A.), suggested co-sponsoring a topic session at the 
PICES 2012 Annual Meeting (October 2012, Hiroshima, Japan).  He has also invited POC participation 
in the CLIVAR Pacific Panel meeting in April 2012; 
• In addition, close relationships were established with the Ecosystem Studies in Sub-Arctic Seas 
(ESSAS) program. WG 20 members, Wang, Curchitser, and Foreman gave presentations at ESSAS 
annual meetings, and Christian was a plenary speaker at the ESSAS Open Science Meeting (May 2011, 
Seattle, U.S.A.). 
 
6. Convene workshops/sessions to evaluate and compare results; 
• WG 20 workshops and business meetings were held at each of the PICES Annual Meetings from 2006 
to 2010.  Three of these workshops meetings were held jointly with CFAME;  
• a WG 20 member participated in the CFAME workshop on “Linking and visualizing climate-forcing 
mechanisms and marine ecosystem changes: a comparative approach” (April 2008, Honolulu, U.S.A.); 
• a WG 20 member co-convened a session entitled “Climate model projections” at the International 
Symposium on the Effects of climate change in the world’s oceans (May 2008, Gijón, Spain);  
• a WG 20 member co-convened a session entitled “Anthropogenic perturbations of the carbon cycle and 
their impacts in the North Pacific” at the PICES 2009 Annual Meeting (October 2009, Jeju, Korea); 
• a WG 20 member co-convened a session entitled “Downscaling variables from global models” at the 
International Symposium on Climate change effects on fish and fisheries (April 2010, Sendai, Japan). 
 
7. Publish a final report summarizing results 
• This is it! 
 
 
2.2 Recommendations 
 
1. The analysis and evaluation of IPCC global and regional climate model output (TOR #1) needs to be 
continued.  The next IPCC release, Assessment Report 5, is scheduled for 2013, and some associated GCM 
output is expected by late 2011.  James Overland, Muyin Wang, Chan Joo Jang, Sang-Wook Yeh and other 
PICES members are planning to evaluate these outputs.  This activity may not warrant its own new working 
group but to keep abreast of the results of these analyses, PICES should ensure that it falls under the auspices 
of the Advisory Panels on Climate, Oceanographic Variability and Ecosystems (COVE) and/or Status, 
Outlooks, Forecasts, and Engagement (SOFE) of PICES’ science program, FUTURE (Forecasting and 
Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of the North Pacific Ecosystem).  Perhaps it could be a 
TOR under the expert group that is anticipated as a follow-up to WGCCIFS.  (Note: Since the original 
submission of this report, a Section on Climate Change Effects on Marine Ecosystems was approved by 
PICES Science Board and Governing Council and was established in October 2011. See PICES website at 
http://www.pices.int/members/sections/CCME-S.aspx.) 
 
2. A new working group to investigate North Pacific climate variability at time scales shorter (e.g., interannual 
and decadal) than those that are the traditional focus of IPCC GCMs should be created. Past IPCC reports 
have focussed on century-scale projections, but IPCC Assessment Report 5 will also include decadal 
predictions.  Though previous century-scale projections could only be evaluated statistically (i.e., these 
projections did not predict conditions for specific future dates), the decadal predictions should be directly 
comparable with subsequent observations.  The proposed new working group could contribute significantly 
to this IPCC activity and is an outcome of the workshop on “Exploring the predictability and mechanisms of 
Pacific low frequency variability beyond inter-annual time scales” that was convened by Emanuele Di 
Lorenzo and Shoshiro Minobe and held at the PICES 2009 Annual Meeting (October, 2009, Jeju, Korea).  
Draft TORs for this new working group (tentatively titled “North Pacific Climate Variability and Change”) 
were presented at the 2010 Science Board meeting.  The working group should be under the POC (and 
MONITOR?) committee(s), and already has the strong support of COVE-AP.  (Note: Since the original 
submission of this report, this new working group was approved by PICES Science Board and Governing 
Executive Summary and Recommendations Section 2 
6  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
Council and was established in June 2011.  The final Terms of Reference for the Working group can be 
found in Appendix 3.  Also see PICES website http://www.pices.int/members/working_groups/wg27.aspx.) 
 
3. The development of RCMs around the North Pacific (TOR #3) will continue and to keep abreast of these 
developments, PICES should provide a venue for collaborative discussions among the developers.  These 
RCMs will increasingly be coupled to more complex ecosystem models (e.g., Yamanaka et al. in the 
Northwest Pacific, and Curchitser, Rose, Hermann et al. in the Northeast Pacific) and become increasingly 
valuable tools for FUTURE.  Again, it is not clear where these activities best fit within PICES but they 
should fall under the auspices of some formal entity. Curchister et al. (this report) have not only 
demonstrated that important features (e.g., upwelling) driving ecosystem states cannot be adequately 
discerned with GCMs, but have also shown that the feedback from resolving such features has impacts 
beyond the RCM domain.  While these and other RCM results will be the subject of continued analysis and 
discussion, it is evident that RCMs are an essential tool for FUTURE, providing new information that cannot 
be gleaned from the statistical downscaling of GCM projections.  (Note: Since the original submission of 
this report, a Working Group on Regional Climate Modeling was approved by PICES Science Board and 
Governing Council and was established in October 2011. For Terms of Reference for this Working Group, 
see Appendix 4.  Also see PICES website http://www.pices.int/members/working_groups/wg29.aspx.) 
 
4. Related to recommendation 3 above, live-access servers or ftp sites should be created to archive and provide 
easy access to results from North Pacific RCMs, analogous to the PCMDI archive for IPCC GCM results.  
This would be a natural follow-up to WG 20’s TOR #4. Related observations and historical re-analyses 
could also be included on this site.  The RCM output would provide fishery scientists with climate change 
variables on much finer spatial scales than can be resolved with the GCMs.  This activity could be taken up 
by the COVE or SOFE Advisory Panels and/or the Technical Committee on Data Exchange (TCODE). 
  
5. Links to GCM/RCM websites like the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program 
(NARCCAP, http://www.narccap.ucar.edu) should be provided (and regularly updated) through the PICES 
website.  Similar links to useful GCM analyses and culling procedures, such as those described in section 3.9, 
should also be made easily available to the PICES community.  “Guidance”, or more accurately, suggestions, 
for model culling procedures have been summarized in Overland et al., 2011.

Abstract 
 
Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO
2
 has historically mitigated CO
2
 emissions, but the ocean’s capacity to absorb 
anthropogenic CO
2
 may be declining due to climate change and ocean acidification.  In the North Pacific, the 
zonal extent of the ocean basin decreases with increasing latitude, and the area of the subarctic zone may contract 
as warming moves the circumglobal wind patterns poleward.  A set of historical and IPCC emission scenario 
runs were conducted with a coupled climate/carbon cycle model, the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM1), 
to assess the effect of anthropogenic CO
2
 forcing on the carbon cycle of the North Pacific in the 20th and 21st 
centuries.  The model projects large increases in sea surface temperature globally, declining mixed layer depth 
and export production, and enhanced dinitrogen fixation.  Trends in the North Pacific are generally coherent with 
global trends but in some cases are of opposite sign in the subtropical and subarctic regions. The subarctic zone, 
which accounts for the largest amount of CO
2
 uptake, is getting smaller.  The North Pacific share of global 
extratropical ocean CO
2
 uptake is projected to decline from >50% in the preindustrial state to about 25% by 2100. 
The calcite and aragonite saturation horizons are projected to shoal significantly.  Globally, the area where the 
saturation horizon is less than 200 m will more than double, including large areas of the northern North Pacific. 
 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO
2
 has given 
humans a significant subsidy in terms of climate 
change.  Were 100% of CO
2
 emissions to remain in 
the atmosphere, climate change would proceed much 
more rapidly. More than half of historic emissions are 
now dissolved in the world’s oceans (Sabine et al., 
2004). As atmospheric CO
2
 grows and begins to affect 
ocean temperature, stratification, circulation, and 
biology in increasingly significant ways, the fraction 
of new emissions taken up by the ocean on societally 
relevant time scales cannot be assumed to be the same 
as it was in the 19th and 20th centuries.  In general, it 
should be expected to decline, causing a positive 
feedback on future warming (Denman et al., 2007). 
Ocean ecosystems are also increasingly impacted by 
acidification caused by anthropogenic CO
2
, and the 
North Pacific is particularly vulnerable because the 
lysocline is naturally shallow (Feely et al., 2004). 
 
A signature of anthropogenic climate change is the 
poleward migration of the circumglobal wind patterns 
that divide the midlatitude ocean into subtropical and 
subpolar gyres.  This trend is better constrained (e.g., 
more consistent across models) in the southern 
hemisphere than the northern, but is expected to occur 
in both hemispheres (Yin, 2005; Fyfe et al., 2007). 
The subarctic Pacific is particularly vulnerable to 
these changes because the zonal extent of the basin 
decreases with increasing latitude.  Hence the most 
biologically productive (subpolar) regions are shrinking. 
The biogeochemical effects of these changes are 
impossible to predict in detail, but there is some 
Activities of Working Group Members Section 3 
10  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
emerging consensus regarding the broad outlines (e.g., 
Orr et al., 2005).  In this report an Earth System 
Model with prognostic land and ocean carbon cycle 
models and freely evolving atmospheric CO
2
 
concentration was used to assess the changes in ocean 
biogeochemistry resulting from CO
2
 emissions and 
associated climate change, with emphasis on the 
North Pacific Ocean. 
 
 
Methods 
 
Model description 
The model used is the Canadian Earth System Model 
v.1, which has been described at length in previous 
publications (Zahariev et al., 2008; Arora et al., 2009; 
Christian et al., 2010). Its main features are 
summarized only briefly here.  The atmosphere model 
is run at T47 spectral resolution, a 96 × 48 surface grid. 
The 192 × 96 ocean model, with four grid cells 
beneath each atmosphere grid cell, has a 
longitude/latitude resolution of approximately 1.875°. 
The ocean carbon cycle model is based on the Ocean 
Carbon Cycle Model (OCMIP II) protocols (Najjar 
and Orr, 1998) and couples the carbon cycle to an 
NPZD (nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus) 
ecosystem model via a fixed C/N Redfield Ratio and a 
temperature-dependent rain ratio (ratio of inorganic to 
organic carbon in vertical flux at the base of the 
euphotic zone) (Zahariev et al., 2008).  The terrestrial 
carbon cycle uses the atmosphere grid and the 
Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) v. 2.7. It 
includes “downregulation” of photosynthesis under a 
high-CO
2
 atmosphere, as described by Arora et al. 
(2009) and historic land-use change, as described by 
Wang et al. (2006).  Atmospheric CO
2
 is freely 
varying and inert (no sources or sinks within the 
atmosphere). 
 
Atmospheric CO
2
 is carried as a three-dimensional 
advected tracer, and treated as such in the radiation 
calculations.  Other major greenhouse gases such as 
CH
4
 and N
2
O are assumed to be spatially uniform and 
are treated individually in the radiation code.  A small 
adjustment to the radiative transfer scheme was made 
subsequent to the simulations described in the 
publications cited above, to reduce the climate 
sensitivity to non-CO
2
 greenhouse gases. 
Concentrations and emissions are from the Special 
Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 scenario 
(IPCC, 2000).  This is a “high emission” scenario, 
where atmospheric CO
2
 concentration continues to 
grow exponentially throughout the 21st century, 
exceeding 800 ppm by 2100. For CO
2
, only emissions 
are used while for CH
4
 and N
2
O, the atmospheric 
concentrations are specified according to the 
scenarios.  The model does an excellent job of 
reproducing the observed historical atmospheric CO
2
 
concentrations when forced with historic emissions 
(Arora et al., 2009).  All other forcings (e.g., solar and 
aerosol) are fixed at 1850 values and are as described 
in Arora et al. (2009) and Christian et al. (2010). 
 
 
Results 
 
Global mean trends 
Global mean trends in ocean biogeochemical fields 
show substantial alteration in the 21st century which, 
in many cases, is well underway by the end of the 20th 
(Fig. 3.1.1).  Mixed layer depth declines by ~3 m by 
2000 and 10 m by 2100 (Fig. 3.1.1).  This is 
principally a result of less deep convection in the high 
latitudes, as the model vertical resolution is 
inadequate to meaningfully simulate the variability of 
the low-latitude mixed layer; the model simulates the 
global distribution of maximal winter mixing depth 
well (Zahariev et al., 2008).  Export production and 
dinitrogen (N
2
) fixation also show more or less 
monotonic trends that are well underway by 2000  
(Fig. 3.1.1).  Some biogeochemical fields, such as 
primary production and CaCO
3
 export, do not show 
monotonic trends (Fig. 3.1.1), but show competing 
effects of declining productivity due to increasing 
stratification and enhancement under a warming 
climate because N
2
 fixation and the rain ratio are 
parameterized as functions of temperature.  This 
illustrates the indirect effects that make detection 
particularly difficult. Ocean CO
2
 uptake continues to 
increase, but the rate of growth declines towards the 
second half of the 20th century (Fig. 3.1.1). 
 
Regional trends relative to global trends 
The correlation of local or regional trends with global 
trends is given in Table 3.1.1 for some of the fields 
shown in Figure 3.1.1.  pH and surface ocean pCO
2
 
and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were excluded 
because these trends are quite uniform globally, so 
that all of the correlation coefficients exceed 0.97. 
The benchmark North Pacific stations HOT (Station 
ALOHA), KNOT, and PAPA (OSP) are illustrated 
along with HOT’s subtropical Atlantic sister-station 
BATS, and regional means for the North Pacific and 
North Atlantic.  Sea surface temperature shows a 
global trend nearly as uniform as pCO
2
 and DIC, with 
the weakest correlation of 0.90 at OSP (Table 3.1.1).  
Sea surface salinity, by contrast, shows regional 
variations, with a general trend towards greater 
salinity in the subtropics (e.g., BATS) and freshening 
Section 3 Activities of Working Group Members

in the subarctic Pacific.  Mixing depth does not show 
coherent patterns at individual stations but the 
regional trends are strongly correlated with the global 
trend.  The same is true of ocean CO
2
 uptake. The 
subtropical stations are more coherent with the global 
and regional trends than with the subarctic ones.  At 
the subarctic stations, CO
2
 uptake declines due to 
reduced export production, warmer temperatures, and 
weaker vertical mixing in winter while at the 
subtropical ones, increased dinitrogen fixation (DNF) 
counteracts these trends (which would have less effect 
in any case because the environment is already warm, 
stratified, and oligotrophic). DNF shows strong 
positive correlations across the board because the 
subtropical environment that HOT and BATS represent 
dominates the global and regional trends.  Primary and 
export production declines globally, with the counter- 
trend in the subtropics, again, driven by DNF. Export 
production in CanESM1 is dominated by the Southern 
Ocean (Zahariev et al., 2008), but the decline in the 21st 
century is primarily in the northern hemisphere 
mid-latitudes (not shown).  CaCO
3
 export shows little 
temporal trend globally (Fig. 3.1.1) and little 
correlation of regional and global trends (Table 3.1.1).

 uptake, for the A1B emissions scenario

Ocean CO
2
 uptake 
Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO
2
 has helped to 
mitigate climate change, but climate change is itself 
beginning to alter ocean processes that affect rates of 
CO
2
 uptake.  It has mostly been assumed that ocean 
uptake of anthropogenic CO
2
 (distinct from 
atmospheric CO
2
 generally) is an abiotic process 
driven by rising atmospheric concentration, and that 
the biological component is small or negligible 
because the strength of the biological pump has 
changed little since the preindustrial state. In the 
North Pacific Ocean, modelled ocean uptake of CO
2
 
declines throughout the 21st century relative to the 
extratropical ocean as a whole (Fig. 3.1.2).  (In 
general, the tropical ocean is a source of atmospheric 
CO
2
 and the extratropical ocean is a sink; it is not 
possible to calculate the ratio of a specific region to 
the global integral because the global total is zero in 
the preindustrial state.)  All of the changing ocean 
processes discussed above contribute to this trend: 
greater stratification (shallower mixing depth), 
warmer sea surface temperature (decreased solubility 
of CO
2
), and a weakening biological pump expressed 
as lower export production (Fig. 3.1.1 and Table 
3.1.1). As noted above, the latter trend is counteracted 
Section 3 Activities of Working Group Members  
PICES Scientific Report No. 40 13 
in the subtropical ocean by increasing dinitrogen 
fixation, but in the North Pacific, the contribution of 
this process is relatively small and the region declines 
in importance as a CO
2
 sink.  This is likely because 
the subtropical region (weak CO
2
 sink) is expanding 
poleward at the expense of the subarctic (strong sink), 
whose total area is contracting due to the basin 
geometry. 
 
Ocean acidification 
The North Pacific is among the regions most 
vulnerable to the calcium carbonate undersaturation 
impact of anthropogenic CO
2
 because the saturation 
horizon is naturally shallow (Fig. 3.1.3). Accumulated  
anthropogenic CO
2
 causes notable shoaling of the 
saturations horizons for aragonite (ASH) and calcite 
(CSH), with the ASH rising above the 100 m level 
over large areas of the North Pacific by 2100  
(Fig. 3.1.3). 
 
The fraction of the total ocean area where the ASH 
lies at less than 200 m depth increases by about 20% 
from 1850–2000, and more than doubles relative to 
the preindustrial state by 2100 (Table 3.1.2).  So the 
vast majority of the 1850–2100 increase occurs in the 
21st century, but the trend is already well underway 
by 2000.  The area where the CSH lies at less than 500 
m depth increases only about 10% by 2000, but by 
two thirds (relative to preindustrial) by 2100  
(Table 3.1.2).

The North Pacific share of the global ocean area with 
a shallow lysocline increases quite rapidly for 
aragonite, but not for calcite (Table 3.1.2).  In the 
North Pacific, the area with an aragonite saturation 
horizon depth (Z
ASH
) less than 200 m is more than 
triple the preindustrial value by 2100 (Fig. 3.1.4), and 
the North Pacific share of the global ocean area with 
Z
ASH
 < 200 m increases by half, from about 6 to 9% 
(Table 3.1.2).  The North Pacific share of the area 
where the calcite lysocline (Z
CSH
) is less than 500 m is 
relatively constant at 10–11% (Table 3.1.2), and 
peaks in about 2050, declining thereafter as larger 
areas with Z
CSH
 < 500 m develop in the tropics and the 
Southern Ocean (not shown).  Nonetheless, the total 
area with Z
CSH
 < 500 m in the North Pacific increases 
by about half, from 18 to 28 million square kilometres 
(Fig. 3.1.4). 
 
Discussion and Conclusions 
 
The impacts of warming climate and ocean 
acidification are still very uncertain, and model 
projections are, at best, hypotheses. Ocean acidification 
due to accumulation of anthropogenic CO
2
 is a robust 
prediction (Orr et al., 2005), but its biological impacts 
and feedbacks are still largely unknown (and are not 
considered in this version of the model).  The model 
projects declining export globally, a potential positive 
feedback on atmospheric CO
2
 growth, but this trend is 
counteracted by increasing dinitrogen fixation. In the 
model, both dinitrogen fixation and the inorganic/ 
organic carbon flux “rain ratio” are parameterized as 
increasing with increasing sea surface temperature.  
These parameterizations are based more on the 
apparent latitudinal distribution of these processes 
Section 3 Activities of Working Group Members  
PICES Scientific Report No. 40 15 
in the modern ocean than on any well constrained 
statistical relationship with temperature per se. While 
it is certainly plausible that the subtropical gyre will 
expand poleward at the expense of the subarctic 
region, it is less certain that dinitrogen fixation within 
the subtropical region will continue to increase with 
rising surface temperature as it does in the model 
(which does not consider, e.g., supplies of iron and 
phosphorus as potentially limiting factors). 
Nonetheless, it seems clear that the North Pacific in 
the 21st century enhanced greenhouse will experience

Summary 
 
PICES Working Group 20 research in British Columbia 
(BC) waters focused on contributions to each of the first 
four Terms of Reference. Specifically, they were 
directed at:   
• analysing and evaluating historical simulations 
and projections of winds along the BC shelf using 
results from global climate models (GCMs) 
submitted to the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) for their 4th Assessment 
Report. The results of this analysis were 
published in Merryfield et al. (2009) and are 
summarized in section I. 
• facilitating analyses of climate change effects on 
marine ecosystems and ecosystem feedbacks by 
participating in workshops organized jointly with 
the Climate Forcing and Marine Ecosystems 
(CFAME) Task Team, and contributing to a 
paper (King et al., 2011) that estimated climate 
change impacts on the California Current 
ecosystem.  In addition, Drs. Michael Foreman 
and Yasuhiro Yamanaka were members of the 
PICES/ICES Working Group on Climate Change 
Impacts on Fish and Shellfish (a successor to 
CFAME) and in that capacity, Dr. Foreman 
co-convened the session “Downscaling variables 
from global models” at the International 
Symposium on Climate Change Effects on Fish 
and Fisheries in Sendai, Japan, April 25–29, 2010.  
• developing and running a high-resolution regional 
climate model for the BC continental shelf that is 
forced by, and takes its boundary conditions from, 
IPCC global and/or North American regional 
climate models.  A progress report on this 
development is given in section II. 
• augmenting the Faucher et al. (1999) extended 
data set of buoy wind measurements off the BC 
coast by filling gaps over the last decade with 
values from a NASA archive, and analysing the 
50-year time series for trends in the upwelling 
and downwelling magnitudes and timing.  This 
work is described in Foreman et al. (2011) and 
summarized in section III.  
 
 
I Downscaling GCM Winds off the BC Shelf  
 
As this section is largely a summary of Merryfield et 
al. (2009), the interested reader is referred to that 
publication for more details.  
 
Surface marine winds along the west coast of Canada 
have a pronounced influence on the oceanography and 
ecosystems of the region. Although other forcing 
influences like tides, the bifurcation of the eastward 
North Pacific Current into the southward California 
Current and the northward Alaska Current, and 
freshwater forcing from coastal rivers also contribute, 
marine winds dominate the seasonality of the coastal 
surface currents. In autumn and winter, the Aleutian 
Low pressure system generally gives rise to southerly 
winds and a northward-flowing, downwelling coastal 
current regime. In the spring and summer, a relatively 
stable offshore high pressure system produces 
northwesterly winds and a southward flowing, 
upwelling regime. This seasonal cycle strongly 
modulates primary production and is a main reason 
why the continental shelf off southern Vancouver 
Island supports such a large fishery (Ware and 
Thomson, 2005).  
 
Long-term observations of the coastal winds in this 
region have been made via a network of coastal 
meteorological buoys (Fig. 3.2.1) since the late 1980s 
(Cherniawsky and Crawford, 1996).  Faucher et al. 
(1999) extended these time series back another 30 
years with an empirical-statistical downscaling 
procedure that was applied to large-scale predictors 
derived from the National Centers for Environmental 
Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis.  The resulting data set 
consists of 6-hourly winds at 13 buoy sites for the 
period 1958–1997.  This data set provides an excellent 
basis for not only examining possible trends and shifts 
Section 3 Activities of Working Group Members  
PICES Scientific Report No. 40 17 
(section III), but also for evaluating the winds 
produced by global climate models. The aim of this 
study was to examine projected changes in surface 
marine winds off the Canadian west coast, under the 
assumption they should have significant impacts on 
coastal ecosystems.  This was done by interpolating 
winds from 18 IPCC climate model simulations 
(Table 3.2.1) to the buoy locations and comparing 
contemporary and future decadal averages.  
 
To facilitate our analyses, the buoys were grouped 
into four categories (Table 3.2.2).  The first step in the 
analysis was to assess the accuracy of the model 
winds through comparisons with buoy observations. 
Figure 3.2.2 summarizes results for summer (June– 
August) over the 20-year period of 1976–1995 and 
shows that despite the coarse resolution of the CGMs, 
there is relatively good agreement between the models 
and observations.   Though there is scatter among the 
models, their ensemble averages display reasonably 
accurate upwelling winds at the near offshore and 
inshore buoy locations. 
Figure 3.2.3 summarizes GCM projected wind 
changes, shown as fractional increases in magnitude 
and directional changes (degrees clockwise) over the 
periods 2030–2049 and 2080–2099 relative to 
1976–1995, at the near offshore buoys.  The winter 
(January–March, JFM) winds show sufficient scatter 
among the GCMs so that no statistically significant 
pattern emerges, though the multi-model ensemble 
means suggest an approximately 5% intensification 
and slight counterclockwise rotation.  However, a 
much clearer picture emerges for the summer 
(June–August, JJA) wind changes.  Although only a 
few of the individual model changes are significant, 
the ensemble means exhibit wind speed increases of 
approximately 2–4% and clockwise rotations of about 
2° that, in some instances, are statistically significant. 
The JJA wind changes between 1976–1995 and 
2080–2099 show similar, though considerably 
stronger, trends consisting of wind speed increases 
ranging from 4.5 to 9% and clockwise rotations 
between 4° and 5°.  The strength of this signal is 
reflected in substantial inter-model consistency, with 
16 models showing clockwise rotations.

smaller numerals denote the number of models in the corresponding quadrants. Bold letters indicating a probability that such 
a result would arise under the null hypothesis of no change is less than 0.05.  
 
 
Though the foregoing projected changes may have 
significant implications for marine ecosystems along 
the southern BC continental shelf where summer 
upwelling winds bring nutrients to the surface and 
drive upper trophic level productivity (Ware and 
Thomson, 2005), several other projected changes 
need to be considered before the complete picture is 
understood. Warmer air temperatures can be expected 
to heat the sea surface and contribute to a stronger 
stratification that will inhibit upwelling.  Climate 
model analyses along the southern California shelf by 
Auad et al. (2006) showed that an increase in 
upwelling wind speed was sufficient to overcome 
stronger stratification.  However, this result may not 
carry over to BC where water column stratification is 
largely determined by salinity rather than temperature 
variations.  Projected changes in precipitation and 
river discharge (Morrison et al., 2002), as well as the 
air–sea heat flux, will thus be needed to force a regional 
coastal ocean model in order to provide better estimates 
of physical changes to the coastal waters off BC.  The 
development of such a regional ocean-only climate 
model is described in the next section. 
 
 
II Regional Climate Model Development for 
the BC Shelf:  Progress to Date 
 
The ocean model that will be used to estimate future 
circulation and water properties along the BC shelf 
was developed by Masson and Fine (2011).  It is an 
application of the Regional Ocean Modeling System 
(ROMS, Haidvogel et al., 2008) with approximately  
3 km resolution, and the coverage is shown in Figure 
3.2.4. (Note that ROMS was also used in the 
Northeast Pacific simulations described in section 3.7 
(Curchitser et al.)).  The model is forced with tides, 
daily wind and heat flux from the North American 
Section 3 Activities of Working Group Members  
PICES Scientific Report No. 40 21 
Regional Reanalysis (NARR), freshwater runoff, and 
salinities and temperatures that are nudged back to 
climatology along the lateral ocean boundaries.  With 
initial temperatures and salinities taken from this 
same climatology, a model simulation over the period 
1995–2009 has been shown to reproduce the major 
seasonal currents and elevation time series from 
coastal tide gauges with reasonable accuracy.  The 
interested reader is directed to Masson and Fine 
(2011) for more details.

Activities of Working Group Members Section 3 
22  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
In order to use this model for future projections, it 
need only be run with suitable future forcing and 
initial fields.  As the gravitational forcing fields that 
determine the tides are completely predictable, that 
component can be easily forecast.  The required 
atmospheric forcing can be obtained by applying 
downscaling techniques to output from GCMs and/or 
regional climate models (RCMs) that are available 
from either:  
• the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 
3 (CMIP3) multi-model data set of the World 
Climate Research Programme (WCRP), 
assembled at the Program for Climate Model 
Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI, http:// 
www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/) to inform the IPCC 4th 
Assessment, or 
• the North American Regional Climate Change 
Assessment Program (NARCCAP, http://www. 
narccap.ucar.edu/). 
 
As the NARCCAP data has a finer horizontal 
resolution (approximately 50 km) and thus should be 
better to able to capture spatial variations in  
(1) terrestrial precipitation (both rainfall and 
snowfall) and (2) oceanic winds and heat fluxes, it 
was chosen. As a consequence, our model simulations 
focussed on the NARCCAP-defined “current” and 
“future” time periods of 1970–1999 and 2040–2069, 
respectively. Note that the NARCCAP future 
simulations assume the A2 emissions scenario (no 
leveling off of greenhouse gases).  Initial conditions, 
boundary conditions and atmospheric forcing values 
were generally constructed for the future scenario by 
calculating anomalies between future and current 
scenarios from larger-scale models and adding them 
to the current scenario values. 
 
There are 6 RCMs within NARCCAP.  Though we 
eventually aim to force our BC shelf model with the 
atmospheric anomalies from all 6 and compute 
ensemble averages of the associated results, our initial 
anomalies for air temperature, air pressure and 
humidity were calculated using only one, the 
Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) which, in 
turn, was forced by the Canadian Global Climate 
Model (CGCM3).   Since the CRCM has significantly 
lower resolution than our oceanic shelf model, there 
were regions that it defined as land and our model 
defined as water.   As the values for air temperature, 
air pressure and humidity given by the CRCM in these 
regions were affected by being over land, new values 
for these coastal areas were calculated using 
Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs). These EOFs 
were generated using NARR data over a 15- year 
period between 1995 and 2009 where 14 years were 
used to generate the EOFs and the remaining year was 
used to test the ability of the EOFs to generate coastal 
data based on offshore data.  Ten EOFs were used to 
approximate the data and the regeneration of the test 
year was accomplished with an average R-squared 
value of 0.95 and p-values with an order of magnitude 
10
–5
.   
 
Dealing with the rest of the atmospheric forcing was 
less complex. As no land effects were noticeable in 
the CRCM precipitation output, these data were used 
as-is to calculate the necessary anomalies.   Shortwave 
and longwave radiation showed no significant 
difference between the current and future scenarios, 
so these forcings were left at their current scenario 
values.   
 
Anomalies for the initial oceanic temperature and 
salinity fields were calculated from CGCM3 output.  
As with the CRCM downscaling, the coarse CGCM3 
resolution necessitated downscaling to the ROMS 
grid.  However, in this case the number of points in 
the 3-D GCM grid would have made using EOFs 
prohibitive, so latitudinal average anomalies were 
found and applied to the current scenario fields over 
the entire grid.   The results are shown in Figure 3.2.5. 
The same field was applied to the boundary 
temperature and salinity.

agree in the sign of the change and stippled areas are where more than 90% of the models agree in the sign of the change.  
DJF = winter, JJA = summer. (Figure 10.9 from WG 1 in IPCC AR4, 2007)  
 
 
As baroclinic flows along the BC shelf are largely 
determined by salinity rather than temperature, 
freshwater discharges along the coast are important, 
not only for their direct role in generating coastal 
currents but also indirectly through the role they play 
in transporting larvae and nutrients and acting as 
possible barriers to cross-shelf transport, e.g., from 
shelf-edge upwelling. Figure 3.2.6 shows that 
watersheds along the BC coast are projected to 
become wetter in winter (DJF) and drier in summer 
(JJA).  As a significant amount of the winter 
precipitation away from the coast is stored as 
snow-pack and released later in the year, drier 
summers do not necessarily mean less discharge. 
   
Activities of Working Group Members Section 3 
24  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
The main problem in estimating both historical and 
future freshwater discharge along the BC coast is that 
approximately 40% is ungauged.  Morrison et al. 
(2011) have developed a technique for estimating 
ungauged runoff based on the precipitation, 
temperature, terrain characteristics, and storage 
capacity within 22 watersheds whose freshwater 
discharges affect coastal BC waters.  The technique 
has been verified with historical observations and 
used to reconstruct historical time series. In order to 
employ the same technique to estimate future 
discharges, only future precipitations and 
temperatures need be specified and these have been 
downscaled from the same CRCM model output that 
was used to provide the atmospheric forcing.  An 
earlier study that was restricted to only the Fraser 
River watershed (Morrison et al., 2002) and 
projections from the CCCma IPCC AR3 global model 
predicted only a modest (5%) increase in the average 
total annual discharge over 2070–2099, but increased 
flow over the winter and an earlier (by 24 days) spring 
melt and 18% smaller peak discharge. 
 
At the time of writing this report, only preliminary 
future simulations with the BC regional climate model 
had been carried out.  Average annual sea surface 
temperature anomalies for a 15-year future simulation 
with respect the 1995–2009 Masson and Fine (2011) 
hindcast are shown in Figure 3.2.7b as an example of 
these results. Warmer values are seen everywhere 
along the thalweg (Fig. 3.2.7a) traversing Juan de 
Fuca Strait, Haro Strait, and the Strait of Georgia, but 
due to a combination of tidal mixing and Fraser River 
discharge (which enters the Strait of Georgia at 
approximately 250 km along the thalweg), they are 
certainly not spatially uniform.  More simulations and 
analyses are underway and their results will be 
summarized in a manuscript that will be submitted to 
a peer-reviewed journal.

III Trends in Upwelling and Downwelling 
Winds along the BC Shelf 
 
As this section summarizes Foreman et al. (2011; 
henceforth FPM11), the interested reader is referred 
to that paper for more details.  
 
Using the Bakun (1973) upwelling index to 
approximate the amount of water drawn upward from 
the base of the Ekman layer at 6 equally spaced sites 
between 33°N and 48°N, Bograd et al. (2009; 
henceforth B09) estimated trends and variability in 
coastal upwelling along the California Current 
System (CCS) over the period of 1967–2007. 
Cumulative upwelling indices (CUI, Schwing et al., 
2006) computed for each year and at each site were 
used to quantify the timing of the spring transition, the 
length of the upwelling season, and cumulative 
upwelling and downwelling strength.  Among various 
statistically significant trends, they found that in the 
northern CCS the spring transition was becoming later 
and the upwelling season was becoming shorter at the 
respective rates of 1.0 day year
–1
 and 1.1 days year
–1
. 
 
FPM11 extended the B09 analysis northward to the 
waters off BC where the North Pacific Current 
bifurcates into the California and Alaska Currents 
(Dodimead et al., 1963). Though upwelling is 
generally considered to be a characteristic of only the 
CCS and roughly extends from Vancouver Island to 
Baja California (Thomson, 1981), the latitude of the 
bifurcation (Freeland, 2006) and positions of the 
Aleutian Low and North Pacific High pressure 
systems all exhibit interannual variability so that 
northern BC waters can have a short upwelling season 
(Hsieh et al., 1995).   It is therefore useful not only to 
determine if the trends found by B09 extend to 
southern BC, but also how far that upwelling extends 
to the north and whether or not its timing and 
magnitudes have changed.  
 
As described earlier, Faucher et al. (1999; henceforth 
F99) extended the Environment Canada network of 
weather buoys off the BC coast (Fig. 3.2.1) back to 
1958, and the winds from the 6 stations closest to the 
shelf break (206, 132, 207, 147, 208, 205), rather than 
those derived from atmospheric pressure fields 
 
(b) 
Activities of Working Group Members Section 3 
26  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
(Bakun, 1973), were used to compute our BC CUIs. 
Specifically, the Faucher et al. (1999) version of these 
winds were used up to 1997 while for 1998–2007, 
gaps in the buoy observations were filled using the 
NASA archive of cross-calibrated, multi-platform 
(CCMP) ocean surface winds (Ardizzone et al., 2009; 
(http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/DATA_CATALOG/ccmp
info.html).  See FPM11 for analyses of the differences 
between these data sets and the expected impact of 
combining them on the subsequent trend analyses.   
 
Once all gaps were filled in the wind time series, the 
associated wind stresses, τ, were calculated using the 
bulk formula (Gill, 1982) 
 
τ = ρ
a
*C
d
*|v|v 
 
where ρ
a
 is the air density (1.2 kg m
–3
), C
d
 is a 
constant drag coefficient (0.0013) and v is the wind 
vector with magnitude |v|.  These stresses were then 
resolved into their alongshore and cross-shore 
components where, consistent with alongshore 
bathymetry and coastline orientations (Fig. 3.2.1), 30° 
counterclockwise from north was chosen as the 
alongshore direction for the 3 northern buoys while 
45° clockwise from north was chosen for the southern 
ones.  Offshore/onshore Ekman transports per 100 m 
of coastline were then estimated by dividing these 
alongshore stresses by the Coriolis parameter and 
density of seawater (Pickett and Schwing, 2006).  At 
each buoy location, the CUI was calculated (Schwing 
et al., 2006) by integrating the daily upwelling indices 
over the duration of the upwelling season and for each 
year, the spring and fall transitions were determined 
as the dates when the gradient of the CUI changed 
sign from negative to positive (spring) and vice versa 
(fall). For each buoy location, decadal (or 
climatological) means were then computed by simply 
averaging the CUIs over 10 consecutive years and 
filtering with a 15-day running average to remove any 
remaining high frequency variability.  Consistent with 
B09, the total upwelling magnitude index (TUMI) 
was computed as the difference between CUI values 
at the end and start of the upwelling period, and 
somewhat differently from B09, the total 
downwelling magnitude index (TDMI) was defined 
as the CUI value on December 31 minus the TUMI.  
 
Decadally-averaged CUIs were computed for the F99, 
and observed + CCMP data sets are shown in Figure 
3.2.8.  The associated upwelling start and end dates 
are given in Table 3.2.3 and also shown in Figure 
3.2.8.  The estimation of confidence limits associated 
with these dates is complicated by numerous wiggles 
in the yearly CUIs, even after the application of a 
15-day moving average filter. Though careful analysis 
of local versus global minima/maxima might permit 
the definition of start/end dates for each year, FPM11 
used a bootstrap approach to estimate 90% confidence 
intervals for the values listed in Table 3.2.3.  These 
limits are usually less than about 20 days and 
comparable to those listed in Table 1 of B09, but in 
some instances they can be much larger. The 
interested reader is referred to FPM11 for further 
details.

Visual inspection of the upwelling start dates shown 
in Figure 3.2.8 suggests that despite some 
interdecadal variability, there may be trends towards 
later onsets at all buoys except 147.  In fact, there are 
and FPM11 compute them to be 0.88, 0.39, 0.77, 
–0.69, 0.70, and 0.23 days per year for buoys 206, 132, 
207, 147, 208, and 205, respectively. All are 
significantly different from zero at the 95% level and 
at all buoys except 147 upwelling is becoming later, a 
trend consistent with, though smaller than the 1.0 days 
year
–1
 value that B09 found at their 48°N site. A 
similar analysis was carried out for the upwelling 
season durations and again, at all buoys except 147, 
the trend was becoming shorter.  In this case, all 
trends except that for buoy 207 were significantly 
different from zero at the 95% level and the value for 
buoy 206 was –1.02 days year
–1
, very close to the –1.1 
days year
–1
 that B09 found at their 48°N site.  The 
contrary trends toward an earlier spring transition and 
longer upwelling season at buoy 147 are interesting 
and may arise from changes in the seasonal winds in 
Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound, even 
though opposite trends were found at buoy 207, which 
should also be affected by similar changes.  As seen in 
Figure 3.2.1, Environment Canada has three buoys in 
this region (204, 185, 183) and F99 also extended 
their time series back to 1958.  So it would be feasible 
to employ an analysis similar to what has been done 
here to see what trends emerge.  This has not been 
done yet but is planned for the future. 
 
Table 3.2.4 lists 5 decades of TUMI and TDMI values 
associated with the Figure 3.2.8 CUIs while Figure 
3.2.9 displays these data in graphical form, along with 
linear trends that have been fit via least squares.  Note 
that the TUMIs do not decrease monotonically from 
south to north.  The largest TUMIs are at the second 
most southerly buoy (132) while the fifth buoy (208) 
displays more upwelling than the fourth (147). 
Although there is considerable inter-decadal 
variability and a notable decline in upwelling over the 
last decade at all but buoy 206, all TUMIs except 205 
show an overall increase over the past 5 decades, with 
the largest trends (Table 3.2.4) being at buoys 132 and 
207.  The trends at buoys 206, 132, 207, and 147 are 
significantly different than zero at the 95% confidence 
level while that for buoy 208 is significant at the 90% 
level.  Transforming these trends into 40-year changes 
in the associated upwelling-favourable winds, the last 
column in Table 3.2.4 shows increases ranging 
between 0.9% (205) and 25.7% (147).

Although the largest and smallest (negative) TDMI 
values (Fig. 3.2.9b) arise at the most northerly and 
southerly buoys, namely 205 and 206, TDMIs at the 
buoys in between do not display a monotonic 
progression from north to south.  The second smallest 
TDMI is at the second most northerly buoy (208) and 
the third largest is at second most southerly buoy 
(132). Though all TDMIs show a 1989–1998 decrease 
in downwelling that becomes progressively stronger 
to the north, all linear trends show increased 
downwelling with particularly strong increases over 
1999–2008.  All trends are significantly different 
from zero at the 95% level, with the largest values 
being at buoys 206 and 207.  The associated 40-year 
increases in downwelling-favourable winds range 
between 13.2% (205) and 55.9% (206). 
 
An intensification of TUMI and TDMI along the BC 
shelf over the last 50 years begs the question of 
whether these trends might continue in the future.  As 
described in section I, Merryfield et al. (2009) showed 
that ensemble mean summer winds along the BC shelf 
in the late 21st century were forecast to increase in 
speed by 5 to 10% and rotate clockwise by ≈5°, both 
statistically significant changes, while the associated 
ensemble winter winds showed no statistically 
significant changes. Though these changes are 
considerably less than the historical upwelling- and 
downwelling-favourable wind changes found here, in 
their GCM analyses both Yin (2005) and Salathé 
(2006) found a deepening and northward shift of the 
Aleutian Low accompanied by a northward shift in 
North Pacific storm tracks that would be a consistent 
continuation of our TDMI trends.  Perhaps more 
importantly, Gillett et al. (2003) not only found trends 
in December–February Northeast Pacific sea level 
pressures over 1948–1998 that are consistent with 
stronger downwelling-favorable winds in the 
California Current region, but they also demonstrated 
that anthropogenic greenhouse gases and sulphate 
aerosols have had a detectable influence on sea level 
pressures over the second half of the 20th century. 
This suggests that these pressure trends (and hence the 
associated intensifying winds) should persist with 
continuing emissions. 
   
Though Global Climate Models (GCMs) have been to 
used to forecast future changes in the seasonality and 
magnitude of winds and river discharges (Morrison et 
al., 2002), further study with coupled ocean– 
atmosphere regional climate models that have much 
finer horizontal resolution than the >1° that is 
common to most GCMs will be necessary to provide 
more credibility and spatial detail. As described in 
section II, such a regional climate model is presently 
under development for the British Columbia 
continental shelf and results from its simulations 
should be available soon.

Kuroshio-Oyashio System 
 
The Kuroshio and Oyashio systems are western 
boundary currents within the subtropical and 
subarctic circulation gyres of the North Pacific, 
respectively (Stommel and Yoshida, 1972).  The 
Kuroshio Current separates from the Japan coast at 
Boso Peninsula, and turns to the east as the Kuroshio 
Extension, which shows typical meanders and 
generates mesoscale eddies by instabilities.  The 
Kuroshio is characterized by warm, highly saline 
oligotrophic waters of the subtropical gyre.  
Wintertime mixing also provides nutrients to the sea 
surface. However, the water column is weakly 
stratified even during winter and the extent of the 
spring bloom is much smaller than that in the Oyashio.  
Spring bloom in the Kuroshio is usually observed in 
February to March (Nagata, 1998).  Primary 
production in the Kuroshio is considered to be limited 
basically by nutrient availability, as in the other 
subtropical regions (Polovina et al., 1995). 
 
The Oyashio flows southward along Hokkaido Island 
and Honshu Island, and turns to the east with 
meanders.  The eastward flowing Oyashio makes the 
Subarctic Front (Oyashio Front) which is a distinctive 
temperature front.  In the region between the 
Subarctic Front and the Kuroshio Extension (called as 
the Kuroshio-Oyashio Transition Zone), cold and 
warm waters mix with each other in a complex 
manner, forming many mesoscale features.  The 
Oyashio is characterized by low temperature, low 
salinity, and high nutrients.  Nutrient supply by 
wintertime mixing triggers an extensive spring bloom 
during late April to May at the time when the mixed 
layer depth becomes shallower than the critical depth. 
 
One of the distinctive features of the Kuroshio-Oyashio 
system is the large contrast of environments to 
latitudinal direction.  Small pelagic fish in this area 
 
spawn in the subtropical region and migrate to feed in 
the highly productive subarctic region. The size of 
dominant zooplankton increases with latitude, and the 
start of active plankton production is early in the south 
and later in the north. Therefore, the ontogenetic 
migration in the Kuroshio-Oyashio system is favorable 
for these small pelagic fish (Ito et al., 2004).  More 
detailed descriptions of Kuroshio-Oyashio system are 
described in Yatsu et al. (2011). 
 
 
Approaches to End-to-End Ecosystem 
Modeling 
 
Marine ecosystem and fish resources are affected by 
various factors, including climate change and human 
impacts.  We consider the marine system in terms of 
the following three components (Fig. 3.3.1): (1) the 
various environmental factors surrounding the marine 
ecosystem (e.g., oceanic physical environment, 
atmospheric CO
2
 concentration, river discharge of 
nutrients, aerial dust deposition), (2) the lower-trophic 
level marine ecosystem (LTLE), including biogeo- 
chemical cycles, and (3) fish resources as the 
higher-trophic level ecosystem (HTLE). Each 
component involves strong interactions of essential 
physical, chemical or biological processes.  In the 
case of the climate system, the air–sea interactions 
associated with climate change, e.g., global warming, 
decadal and interannual variations like PDO (Pacific 
Decadal Oscillation) or ENSO (El Niño Southern 
Oscillation), cause significant changes in the physical 
environment, i.e., temperature, strength of stratification, 
light intensity reaching to the sea surface, and ocean 
circulation.  In the LTLE, a linkage between the 
nutrients cycle and biological production, which also 
relates to ecosystem structure, is one of the most 
important relationships. For the HTLE, intra-specific 
or inter-specific competitions between fish could play 
significant roles for a variety of fish resources.

Fig. 3.3.1 Components of natural marine environments. The climate system is modified by global warming which results 
from anthropogenic CO
2
 emission. Climate change, especially global warming and ocean acidification, as well as man-made 
eutrophication, affect marine biogeochemical cycling and ecosystems.  They also give rise to a feedback in the climate 
system by modifying the ability of phytoplankton to absorb anthropogenic CO
2
.  The changes in marine ecosystems and 
fishing pressure control the amount of aquatic resources which, in turn, strongly affects the lower-tropic level ecosystem, 
including zooplankton and phytoplankton. 
 
 
For comprehensive understanding, we must also 
consider the interactions between the three 
components.  For example, the temperature increase 
associated with global warming strengthens 
stratification, which decreases nutrient supply to the 
surface water. On the other hand, a rise in temperature 
generally tends to enhance growth rates of the LTLE, 
and the strengthened stratification could enhance the 
light environment for photosynthesis.  These changes 
in the LTLE (e.g., biomass, production, or species) 
and physical environment also affect the HTLE.  The 
changes in physical environments (e.g., temperature 
and ocean circulation) can also directly affect the 
growth and distribution of fish resources.  In addition 
to these bottom-up effects from climate to the HTLE, 
top-down effects from the HTLE to the LTLE, 
resulting from differential feeding of predators on 
phytoplankton and zooplankton, could exert 
important controls on species dominance (Suda et al., 
2005; Yatsu et al., 2005).  Feedback processes from 
the changes in the LTLE to climate have also been 
suggested, e.g., changes in production of 
dimethylsulphide (DMS; an important climate 
reactive gas) produced by phytoplankton could cause 
a negative feedback to counter warming due to 
climate change (Charlson et al., 1987).  Moreover, 
human impacts like emissions of anthropogenic CO
2
, 
eutrophication and overfishing affect each system.  
Therefore, efforts to clarify both the bottom-up and 
top-down effects are important for a comprehensive 
understanding of interactions and for quantitatively 
evaluating each process. 
 
Two essential requirements must be considered for 
comprehensive modeling to evaluate the impacts of 
climate change on marine ecosystems.  One is the 
adequate representation of changes in physical 
environments (e.g., temperature, currents, depth of the 
mixed layer and intensity of solar radiation) which are 
important for ecosystem changes.  It is also desired to 
reproduce spatio-temporally heterogeneous 
environments from coastal to basin scales, and from 
seasonal to interannual or decadal scales.  The other 
requirement is explicit representations of the 
ecosystem structure and biogeochemical processes at 
each trophic level.  An ideal simulation for future 
projection or hindcast of ecosystem changes should 
employ a fully integrated climate model including fish 
and ecosystem components with two-way interactions.  
However, such an approach is difficult due to 
practical restrictions of computational resources and 
uncertainties of ecosystem dynamics, and we need to 
reduce the physical (i.e., horizontal or vertical 
resolutions) or biogeochemical (i.e., species or 
processes) resolutions. 
 
To evaluate spatio-temporally heterogeneous changes 
in the LTLE, many 3-D biogeochemical models have 
been developed as one-way coupling of the 
hydrodynamic and LTLE models (i.e., the ocean 
currents and other physical properties of the system 
drive the biological dynamics but there is no feedback 
from the biological dynamics to the physics), as 
reviewed in Hood et al. (2006).  Many approaches 
have also been taken to represent the fish-centered 
 
Section 3 Activities of Working Group Members  
PICES Scientific Report No. 40 33 
HTLE and relationship with the LTLE, as reviewed in 
Travers et al. (2007).  However, in many cases 
focusing on the higher-trophic level food web, only 
limited hydrodynamics information has been used in 
the HTLE models (e.g., the physical component of the 
HTLE model is represented as a zero-dimensional 
model or a few box models).  Even if focusing on 
changes in the hydrodynamic environment with the 
HTLE, the information for the LTLE is more limited, 
e.g., to primary production without considering 
plankton composition.  In order to link models from 
climate to fish, end-to-end, a one-way information 
transfer analogous to the relay with a baton, is useful 
as a first step, especially for planktonic community 
dynamics which are largely governed “bottom-up” by 
physical forcing (e.g., Margalef, 1978).  In other 
words, biogeochemical and ecosystem models project 
the impacts of climate change onto the LTLE based 
on the physical environments reproduced or projected 
by a climate model.  In the LTLE models, the 
top-down effects from higher predators usually 
represent as a quadratic mortality term for the highest 
trophic level, which is essentially representing the 
biomass of unresolved fish and other predators scale 
in proportion to the biomass of their prey.  Using the 
results of the LTLE, a fish resources model projects 
the impacts onto the HTLE, including the changes in 
various plankton components in response to changes 
in the physical environment.  In fact, these bottom-up 
relationships to fish resources are shown in some 
studies.  Using trophic dynamic models applied to 
ocean data, Iverson (1990) showed that carnivorous 
fish production is controlled by the availability of 
inorganic nutrients incorporated into the 
phytoplankton biomass and transferred through food 
webs in North American coastal waters.  Ware and 
Thompson (2005) also showed a highly correlated 
relationship between primary production and the 
resident fish yield in the continental margin of 
western North America, using annual fish catch data 
and satellite-derived chlorophyll-a measurements. 
 
 
Previous Studies Approaching End-to-End 
Ecosystem Modeling 
  
As an example of the baton relay from climate change 
to fish via the LTLE, there is a comprehensive 
framework applied to a case of inter-decadal climate 
variability in the North Pacific. Aita et al. (2007) 
developed a global 3-D LTLE model, COCO- 
NEMURO, which is the North Pacific Ecosystem 
Model Used for Regional Oceanography (NEMURO, 
Yamanaka et al., 2004; Kishi et al., 2007; Fig. 3.3.2) 
coupled with the CCSR Ocean Component Model 
(COCO, Hasumi, 2000). Using National Centers for 
Environmental Prediction, NOAA National Weather 
Service/National Center for Atmospheric Research 
(NCEP/NCAR) 6-hourly re-analysis dataset of sea 
surface temperature, freshwater flux, surface wind 
stress and solar radiation for the period 1948–2002, 
they simulated inter-annual variation of the LTLE 
associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), 
focusing particularly on the 1976/1977 climate 
regime shift.  The model successfully reproduced the 
observed decrease in primary production and 
diatom-grazing mesozooplankton biomass (Tadokoro 
et al., 2004).  As a direct receiver of information of 
changes in the LTLE, a fish bioenergetics-based 
population dynamics model coupled with NEMURO 
(NEMURO For Including Saury and Herring: 
NEMURO.FISH) was also developed (Megrey et al., 
2007). Using NEMURO.FISH with the results of Aita 
et al. (2007), wet weight of individual saury in the 
western North Pacific was simulated to have 
decreased after the 1976/1977 climate regime shift, 
due primarily to cooling (Ito et al., 2007).   Rose et al. 
(2007) also showed regionally different responses of 
herring growth in the mid and late 1970s in the 
northeastern Pacific, i.e., herring growth rate 
decreased off the West Coast of Vancouver Island and 
in Prince William Sound, but increased in the Bering 
Sea. This is because the herring growth rate is 
positively correlated with two factors, water 
temperature and abundance of zooplankton as a prey, 
and only one of these two factors determines the 
herring growth rate in each oceanic region, 
respectively.  This baton relaying framework worked 
effectively for evaluating impacts of climate change, 
end-to-end. These evaluations of inter-decadal 
variability in the past serve as a validation of the 
models to be used to project impacts of future climate 
change. 
 
Future responses of the LTLE to global warming have 
been discussed in several previous studies using 3-D 
LTLE models with simulated physical fields from 
climate models.  As a pioneering study, Boyd and 
Doney (2001) conducted a global warming simulation 
with projected physical fields from the NCAR 
Community Climate System Model (Boville and Gent, 
1998) following the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change) SRES (Special Report on 
Emissions Scenarios) A1 scenario, which expects 
very rapid economic growth with increasing 
globalization.  They suggested significant changes by

the end of this century in ecosystem structure, with 
some of the largest regional impacts, especially 
increases in nitrogen fixers in the subtropical regions 
due to strengthened stratification.  Using the same 
kind of approach, it is also generally suggested that 
rising temperatures in high latitudes lead to 
strengthened stratification and decreased nutrient 
supply to surface waters.  As a result, it has been 
suggested that the annually averaged response to 
global warming will include decreases in chlorophyll 
in the high latitude ocean of high productivity (e.g., 
Sarmiento et al., 2004; Schmittner et al., 2008) and 
changes in phytoplankton composition, i.e., shifts 
from diatoms to small phytoplankton groups 
associated with depleted nutrient conditions (Bopp et 
al., 2005; Hashioka and Yamanaka, 2007a, hereafter 
HY07a).  As an impact on the seasonal cycle, HY07a 
also suggested earlier onset of the spring bloom in the 
western North Pacific, with a decrease in maximum 
biomass associated with strengthened stratification.  
They concluded that global warming will not impact 
uniformly on marine ecosystems in all seasons, but 
that effects will be significantly greater at the end of 
the spring bloom.  Therefore, in order to project 
impacts on the HTLE based on the changes in the 
LTLE, it is essential to reproduce the effects of 
warming on seasonal dynamics that can vary over 
regional scales (i.e., 100s of kms). 
 
A few studies have been made in future projections of 
the HTLE using the baton relay approach using the 
LTLE results, including information of plankton 
compositions with a horizontally heterogeneous 
physical environment.  As one example, recently 
Kishi et al. (2009) applied a bioenergetics model, 
NEMURO.FISH, to Japanese common squid, 
Todarodes pacificus, and conducted a global warming 
simulation.  The time-dependent horizontal distribution 
of zooplankton as prey of common squid under the 
global warming condition was calculated by a 3-D 
LTLE model, COCO-NEMURO in HY07a following 
the IPCC IS92a scenario (i.e., atmospheric CO
2
 
concentration reaching 788 ppm in the year 2100).  
Based on these projected results of the LTLE, they 
showed a possibility that wet weight of common squid 
decreases due to rising temperatures exceeding the 
optimum range for growth of common squid.  This 
result suggests that the migration route and spawning 
area of common squid might change with global 
warming.  As another example, Lehodey et al. (2009) 
Section 3 Activities of Working Group Members  
PICES Scientific Report No. 40 35 
projected the potential impacts of global warming on 
the population of bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus, a top 
predator of the pelagic ecosystem, in the Pacific 
Ocean under the IPCC SRES A2 scenario for the 21st 
century (i.e., atmospheric CO
2
 concentration reaching 
850 ppm in the year 2100) using the Spatial 
Ecosystem and Population Dynamics model 
(SEAPODYM; Lehodey et al., 2003). This model 
includes an enhanced definition of habitat indices, 
movements, and accessibility of tuna predators to 
different vertically migrant and non-migrant 
micronekton functional groups.  The simulations are 
driven by the predicted bio-physical environment 
from the Institut Pierre Simon LaPlace (IPSL) climate 
model version 4 (IPSL-CM4) coupled to the oceanic 
biogeochemical model Pelagic Interaction Scheme for 
Carbon and Ecosystem Studies (PISCES; Aumont et 
al., 2003).  In this experiment, they demonstrated the 
potential future changes in distribution and abundance 
of bigeye tuna, i.e., an expansion of the spawning 
habitat and density of larvae, especially in the eastern 
tropical Pacific as a result of the temperature increase 
and changes in productivity and ocean circulation. 
 
 
Future Projections of Ecosystem Change in 
the Kuroshio-Oyashio System 
 
Although the studies cited above applied challenging 
approaches for future projections on global or basin 
scales, there are still some important points which 
should be addressed on the regional scale or 
seasonally specific events.  Most future projections of 
ecosystem change, not only the LTLE but also the 
HTLE, had been conducted using results of 
coarse-resolution climate models (i.e., 1 to 3° in the 
oceanic component; IPCC, 2007) due to limited 
computational resources.  However, coarse-resolution 
models cannot reproduce certain physical features 
which play significant roles in ecosystems, especially 
in the Kuroshio-Oyashio system, that is, meso-scale 
features, current speed, and separation latitude of the 
Kuroshio current.  Therefore, the projected ecosystem 
responses from coarse-resolution models are much 
different from those obtained from higher-resolution 
models.  As an example, using a high-resolution 
climate model which can represent the key features of 
the Kuroshio, Sakamoto et al. (2005) suggested that 
the current speed is accelerated by as much as 30% 
under global warming at the end of the 21st century, 
while the separation latitude of the Kuroshio does not 
change.  These reproductions of heterogeneous 
physical environments are required for the evaluation 
of impacts of climate change on migration routes or 
distributions of pelagic fishes.  We report our 
approach for end-to-end modeling for future 
projection of impacts on the marine ecosystem with 
examples for the LTLE (Hashioka et al., 2009) and 
for the HTLE (Okunishi et al., submitted) in the 
Kuroshio-Oyashio system.  Although simulations by 
high-resolution ecosystem models in many cases must 
use downscaled results of coarse-resolution climate 
models, in our case the projected physical 
environment from the only high-resolution climate 
model, the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on 
Climate (MIROC) version 3.2 (K-1 Model 
Developers, 2004), in the IPCC 4th Assessment 
Report (IPCC, 2007) permitted a direct evaluation of 
impacts on the marine ecosystem without the 
necessity of downscaling.  
 
Future projections for the LTLE 
We developed a regional version of our 3-D 
high-resolution ecosystem model, COCO-NEMURO, 
applying it to the upper 1500 m in the western North 
Pacific (about 110°E–180°, 10°–60°N) with an offline 
calculation method. NEMURO incorporates both 
multi-nutrient limitation (NO
3
, NH
4
 and Si(OH)
4
) and 
a description of the plankton community structure 
with five Plankton Functional Types (PFTs; diatoms, 
non-diatom small phytoplankton, and three 
zooplankton groups), as described in Kishi et al. 
(2007). Climate-induced changes in ocean physics are 
estimated from a high-resolution set-up (i.e., 
horizontal grid-spacing of 0.28° (zonally) × 0.19° 
(meridionally) in the ocean component) of the 
MIROC version 3.2 (K-1 Model Developers, 2004). 
As the physical component of our ecosystem model, 
COCO, is the same as the ocean part of MIROC, the 
projected physical field from MIROC can be used 
directly for offline calculation of our ecosystem 
model. In this study, in order to focus on the impacts 
on the seasonal cycle, we used the daily averaged 
high-frequent physical field from MIROC integrated 
in two configurations (Sakamoto et al., 2005; 
Sakamoto and Hasumi, 2008). One is a pre-industrial 
simulation with fixed external forcing at levels of the 
year 1900.  The other is a global warming simulation, 
where the atmospheric CO
2
 concentration is increased 
at the rate of 1% year
–1
 from the pre-industrial 
condition, which doubles CO
2
 concentrations after 
about 70 years.  To drive the offline ecosystem model, 
we used 10-year datasets of pre-industrial (46th–55th 
simulated years of 295.9 ppm) and global warming 
(76th–85th around 656 ppm) simulations, and 
compared both results for the analysis. 
 
For the 2xCO2 condition, annually averaged 
projected responses of the LTLE to global warming 
Activities of Working Group Members Section 3 
36  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
from our model supports the general conclusions of 
previous studies (e.g., Boyd and Doney, 2001; Bopp 
et al., 2005; HY07a), that is, an increase in 
temperature of 2 to 3° C in the western North Pacific 
leads to the strengthened stratification and decrease in 
nutrient supply to the surface water.  As a result, 
phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations are 
also decreased by 10 to 30%.  We also investigated 
how the spring bloom responds seasonally and 
regionally to global warming under a more realistic 
environment in the high-resolution model.  Our model 
reasonably reproduced the major features of the 
spring bloom: the bloom starts from the Kuroshio 
Extension region and moves northward, and in the 
subarctic region it occurs in coastal areas and moves 
to the open ocean (Fig. 3.3.3a–d).  The projected 
changes in timing of the maximum concentration in 
the spring bloom becomes 10 to 20 days earlier than in 
the pre-industrial simulation in almost all regions in 
the western North Pacific (Fig.3.3.3e).  This is mainly 
caused by the favorable temperature conditions at the 
beginning of the spring bloom and by the shortage of 
nutrients at the end of the bloom associated with 
decreased nutrient supply in winter.  This projected 
response to global warming supports the results of the 
previous study, about a half month earlier (HY07a), 
and is statistically significant (< –95% in Fig. 3.3.3f) 
over wide areas compared with the natural variations. 
 
On the other hand, projected changes in the maximum 
chlorophyll concentration of the spring bloom are not 
regionally unique (Fig. 3.3.3g).  In the southern part 
of the Kuroshio Extension region (< 30°N), the 
maximum concentration decreases by 20 to 40% due 
to strengthened stratification.  In the subarctic region, 
where top-down control has an important role in 
spring (Hashioka and Yamanaka, 2007b, hereafter 
HY07b), the maximum concentration decreases by 20 
to 40% due to the increased grazing rate of 
zooplankton with rising temperature.  However, in the 
northern part of the Kuroshio Extension region, where 
the physical environment is greatly improved in our 
eddy-permitting model, it is interesting that the 
maximum concentration during the spring bloom 
increases by 20 to 40%, associated with global 
warming, although the annually averaged 
phytoplankton concentration slightly decreases.  
These responses to global warming are statistically 
significant compared with the natural variations.  The 
 
projected changes in the LTLE might affect the 
migration route or abundance of adult pelagic fishes.  
Our results suggest that even though the annually 
averaged properties change little, global warming 
could have large impacts on species and 
biogeochemical processes associated with seasonal 
events. 
 
Future projections for the HTLE 
In order to evaluate impacts of climate change on the 
pelagic fish ecosystem, Okunishi et al. (2009) 
developed an individual-based fish migration model 
and applied it to Japanese sardine, Sardinops 
melanostictus, which is one of the commercially 
important species in the western North Pacific.  The 
individual-based model (IBM) is composed of a 
bioenergetics sub-model and a Lagrangian transport 
sub-model.  Fish movement is controlled by feeding 
and spawning migrations with passive transport by 
simulated ocean currents.  Feeding migration was 
assumed to be governed by the search for local 
optimal habitats, which is estimated by the spatial 
distribution of the net growth rate of a sardine 
bioenergetics model.  The forage density is one of the 
most important factors which determine the 
geographical distributions of Japanese sardine during 
their feeding migrations.  Spawning migration was 
modeled by an artificial neural network (ANN) with 
an input layer composed of five neurons that receive 
environmental information (surface temperature, 
temperature change experienced, current speed, day 
length and distance from land). 
 
To investigate the impact of global warming on the 
pelagic fish ecosystem, we conducted both control 
and elevated CO
2
 experiments using the fish 
migration model forced by the predicted physical 
environment (i.e., sea surface current and sea surface 
temperature in the surface 30 m) from the 
high-resolution climate model, MIROC, and 
simulated surface prey density (vertically averaged 
small and large zooplankton and diatoms in the 
surface 30 m) by the LTLE model, COCO-NEMURO. 
They addressed the following key questions:  
(1) changes in the optimal spawning grounds and 
season associated with global warming and  
(2) changes in the geographical fish distributions at 
the adult stage during the harvest season in summer.

The model results demonstrated the possible impacts 
of global warming on the migration pattern and 
growth of Japanese sardine.  The projected frequency 
of low-weight 4-month sardine (< 1 g) in the main 
spawning ground (i.e., near Tosa Bay, south of 
Shikoku Island, Japan) is significantly higher in the 
global warming simulation (relative to the 
present-day case) because juvenile sardines were 
exposed to temperatures higher than optimal for 
feeding.  Because smaller fish have higher mortality 
rates, this result suggests that the recruitment rate 
could decrease under global warming (Fig. 3.3.4).  As 
a result, sardines were predicted to shift their 
spawning areas northward to avoid a collapse in their 
recruitment.  During the northward migration period 
in summer, the geographical distribution of fish was 
projected to shift northward by 1 to 2° under global 
warming as the optimal temperature region for 
feeding expands northward due to rising temperature. 
The Next Generation of End-to-End Models 
   
The effects of feedbacks between the LTLE and 
climate should also be considered as two-way 
interactions.  One of the most important feedbacks 
concerns changes in the strength of the biological 
pump associated with climate change.  The Coupled 
Carbon Cycle Climate Model Inter-comparison 
Project (C4MIP; Friedlingstein, 2006) was designed 
to compare and analyze feedbacks between the carbon 
cycle and climate in the presence of external climate 
forcing.  Recently many feedback processes related to 
changes in phytoplankton compositions (e.g., changes 
in N
2
 fixers, calcifiers, DMS producers and silicifiers) 
have been suggested, and modeling approaches have 
been tried to evaluate the effect of such feedback 
processes, as reviewed in Boyd and Doney (2003).  
To first order, the impacts of these feedbacks 
associated with changes in plankton compositions are

less important than physical feedback processes, 
which is why a one-way flow of information from the 
climate simulation to the LTLE model is a useful 
simplification.  However, we should also consider 
these more subtle feedbacks alongside the one-way 
modeling because large uncertainties remain in the 
modeling of plankton composition, especially for 
future projections. 
 
In the modeling of small pelagic fishes such as sardine, 
anchovy or saury, several significant factors remain to 
be clarified.  One is the grazing effects of top 
predators such as bigeye tuna, skipjack tuna or 
yellowfin tuna, and another is the competition for prey 
plankton among small pelagic fishes.  For example, 
Okunishi et al. (2012) pointed out that the predation 
risk from fish predators, such as skipjack tuna, 
Katsuwonus pelami, which prefer warm water, may 
increase with warming and that this may cause a 
reduction in the biomass of Japanese sardine or 
accelerate the northward shift of sardine migration.  
Moreover, Japanese sardine seem to compete with 
other pelagic fish such as Pacific saury for prey 
plankton (Ito et al., 2007).  Therefore, changes in 
Japanese sardine biomass might reflect the ecosystem 
structure itself, and the change in structure could feed 
back to the Japanese sardine.  Approaches should be 
developed to comprehensively couple the many 
fish-centered food web models that have been 
developed (as reviewed by Travers et al., 2007) with 
LTLE models, which can reproduce the 
heterogeneous distribution of prey.  Even though the 
ecological resolution in the LTLE part of the model is 
coarse, the multi-species, Individual-based OSMOSE 
model (Object-oriented Simulator of Marine 
ecOSystems Exploitation; Shin and Cury, 2001, 
2004) coupled with a biogeochemical model, 
ROMS-NPZD (Regional Ocean Modelling System 
coupled with a NPZD model; Koné et al., 2005; 
Machu et al., 2005), is a challenging approach to 
address this problem. From the perspective of the 
match-mismatch hypothesis (Cushing, 1990), Cury et 
al. (2008) also pointed out potential effects of changes 
in: (1) mean relative timing of prey, (2) level of prey 
abundance, (3) amplitude of year-to-year variations in 
prey timing in regions where inter-annual variability 
in temperature is expected to increase.  Such effects 
are important for estimating growth and survival rates 
in a numerical experiment.  
 
The density-dependent effect of small pelagic fishes is 
one hypothesis with significant implications for 
growth and distribution.  This is a concept of ideal 
free distribution that individual behavior, which 
depends on density-dependent suitability (i.e., higher 
densities of individuals will lower suitability within 
habitats), determines the spatial distribution of a 
group (Myers and Stokes, 1989).  As an example, the 
abundance (fisheries catch) of Japanese sardine was 
high in the mid 1980s and low in the late 1970s and 
early 1990s.  On the other hand, the inter-annual trend 
of individual weights of Japanese sardine showed the 
opposite tendency, with smaller size during the high 
abundance period of the mid 1980s than during the 
periods of low abundance. Wada and Kashiwai (1991) 
also showed a difference in geographical coverage of 
feeding grounds of Japanese sardine, i.e., broad 
coverage in the mid 1980s with a high individual 
growth rate (P/B ratio), and vice versa in the late 
1970s.  These relationships between size, abundance 
and distribution seem to relate to the density- 
dependent effect, while these changes are also 
affected by the bottom-up control associated with 
changes in the LTLE and physical environment.  The 
density-dependent effect for the expansion of fish 
distribution associated with increased fish abundance 
is explained by a conceptual model, “Basin model” 
(MacCall, 1990). Although it is still difficult to 
investigate this influence under realistic environmental 
conditions, even in modeling approaches, explicit 
two-way approaches, including population dynamics, 
should be explored in future studies. 
 
The impacts of human activities, such as the 
overfishing on the HTLE, are considerable problems.  
Addressing this problem will also require a 
comprehensive approach, including the effects of 
fishery changes associated with climate change (e.g., 
the QUEST-FISH project, funded by the UK Natural 
Environment Research Council, NERC, has been 
challenged to estimate the impacts not only on global 
fisheries resources, but also on the national and 
regional economies in fishery-dependent areas; 
Barange et al., 2010).  Demands from government for 
more adequate evaluations of local impacts of climate 
change on coastal ecosystems are generally increasing.  
Using the projected physical environment from a 
high-resolution climate model, we successfully 
addressed the regional impacts of global warming 
with eddy-permitting resolution.  However, because 
the horizontal resolutions of most climate models are 
much coarser (e.g., a few degrees in the ocean 
components), downscaling approaches, such as the 
nesting method, will also also be required for 
addressing the dynamics of coastal ecosystems. 
Moreover, for simulations of the coastal ecosystem, 
coupling with regional terrestrial models, including 
river discharge, may also be significant.

Although we showed an approach for future 
projection of impacts on marine ecosystems using 
results of a climate model, many future projections of 
changes in the physical environment have been 
reported (IPCC, 2007), and various research groups 
have taken many different approaches for evaluating 
impacts on marine ecosystems. In order to reduce 
uncertainties of projections and to understand the 
current results and problems, international 
cooperative efforts like MIPs (Model Intercomparison 
Projects) would be required for both higher- and 
lower-trophic level ecosystem modeling. Another 
significant problem is the shortage of data for 
plankton biomass, composition and physiological 
processes, which limits our ability to rigorously test 
the models.

Introduction 
 
This study investigates changes in the mixed layer 
depth (MLD) in the North Pacific Ocean in response 
to global warming and their impact on primary 
production by comparing outputs from 11 models of 
the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 
(CMIP3).  The ocean mixed layer defines a vertically 
quasi-homogeneous surface region of temperature, 
and salinity or density, which directly interacts with 
the overlying atmosphere. Atmosphere–ocean 
interaction, therefore, can be modulated by the ocean 
mixed layer whose depth is determined by wind 
mechanical stirring, surface buoyancy forcing such as 
heat flux or freshwater flux, or ocean circulation 
changes.  Changes in MLD, for example, influence 
the variability of sea surface temperature and oceanic 
uptake of atmospheric CO
2
 (Kraus and Businger, 
1995).  In addition to air–sea interaction, the MLD 
also affects phytoplankton dynamics by controlling 
the availability of nutrients and light and thus, 
biological productivity in the ocean (Sverdrup, 1953; 
Yentch, 1990). 
 
Significant changes in the circulation of the ocean or 
atmosphere have been projected by coupled climate 
models under global warming (e.g., Lu et al., 2007; 
Vecchi and Soden, 2007; Xie et al., 2010).  Therefore, 
the MLD would change in response to the circulation 
changes under global warming.  For example, the 
deep mixed layers in the Southern Ocean are 
projected to shoal and shift southward in response to 
intensified surface warming and poleward shift of the 
wind field (Sen Gupta et al., 2009).  The winter MLD 
Activities of Working Group Members Section 3 
44  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
is also projected to decrease (Merryfield and Kwon, 
2007; Luo et al., 2009) in most of the North Pacific 
Ocean, resulting in a reduction in the formation of 
mode waters in response to global warming (Luo et al., 
2009).  However, previous studies have focused on 
either general circulation changes (Sen Gupta et al., 
2009) or ensemble means rather than individual 
model simulations (Luo et al., 2009).  This study 
investigates both individual model projections and 
multi-model ensemble changes in the MLD in the 
North Pacific Ocean due to global warming because 
multi-model means often hide biases from individual 
models through the averaging procedure (Lefebvre 
and Goosse, 2008). 
 
The biological consequences of MLD changes are 
also of interest because these changes can affect 
primary production and the timing of spring 
phytoplankton blooms by altering conditions of 
nutrients and light. The changes in primary 
production and timing of seasonal blooms will further 
affect higher trophic levels.  However, it is not easy to 
predict the changes in primary production, which is 
controlled by many factors. Primary production 
consists of two components, regenerated production 
and new production, fueled by different sources of 
nutrient inputs (Eppley and Peterson, 1979). Since 
new production depends on the nutrient inputs from 
outside of the surface layer, primary production will 
largely depend on the change in new production. 
Sources of new production are diverse: upwelling of 
deep waters, eddies, typhoons, nitrogen fixation, river 
runoffs, coastal current transportation and aeolian 
deposits, to name a few.  Therefore, to account for all 
the changes in primary production in the future, all 
these factors have to be considered.  Unfortunately, 
CMIP3 models do not provide all the information 
about these factors.  
 
In this study, we will focus on the changes related to 
seasonal MLD variation based on outputs from 11 
CMIP3 models.  Typical methods to estimate the 
future change in primary production are to use 
ecosystem models coupled to ocean circulation 
models (e.g., Nakata et al., 2004, Sarmiento et al., 
2004; Popova et al., 2006; Hashioka and Yamanaka, 
2007).  However, ecosystem models with different 
structures behave differently. If we were to couple 
several ecosystem models to 11 CMIP3 models and 
compare the future primary production, a tremendous 
amount of work would be required, let aside the 
complications arising in the comparative analysis. 
Instead, we chose to use the simplest approach of 
directly estimating primary production from seasonal 
variation of the MLD.  A similar approach was used 
by Yentch (1990) to estimate new production in the 
North Atlantic.  To estimate the shift in spring bloom 
timing, we calculated the critical depth based on the 
Sverdrup model (1953).  The simple methods used 
here may facilitate a robust comparison of 11 model 
outputs with minimal parameters without the 
confounding effect of different ecosystem model 
structures and parameterization. 
 
 
Data and Methods 
 
CMIP3 models 
This study examines the model outputs from CMIP3, 
as used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report (AR4). The 
outputs from all the CMIP3 models are available from 
the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and 
Intercomparison (PCMDI, archived at http://www- 
pcmdi.llnl.gov/about/index.php) at the Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory. 
 
For the present climate, we used data from the 20th 
climate simulation (20th Century Climate in Coupled 
Models, 20C3M) driven by both anthropogenic and 
natural forcing.  Future projections were also assessed 
from the same models for the Special Report on 
Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario which 
assumes moderate future CO
2
 emissions.  For the 
analysis, outputs from the last two decades were used 
for both 20C3M (1980~1999) and SRES A1B 
(2080~2099) experiments: a 20-year period is 
believed to be sufficient to account for interannual 
variability, giving a robust climate (Sen Gupta et al., 
2009). 
 
This study analyzes as many models as possible to 
calculate MLD because we aim to examine individual 
model simulations, as well as ensemble means, 
focusing on the differences and similarities of model 
simulations.  Table 3.4.A1 lists 11 out of a total 25 
models used in this study, based on the following 
criteria. First, we removed 6 models with which MLD 
estimation was not possible: two models (BCC-CM1 
and INMCM3.0) were removed simply because 
temperature and salinity data were not available in the 
archives. Four models (CCCMA-CGCMT47, 
CCCMA-CGCMT63, NCAR-PCM1, and UKMO- 
HadGEM1) were additionally excluded because their 
first vertical levels start below 10 m depth which is the 
reference depth used for MLD estimation in this study. 
Second, we excluded 4 models (GISS-AOM, GISS-EH, 
GISS-ER, and IAP-FGOALS-g1.0) because they have 
unrealistic 20th century MLD spatial patterns:  the 3 
GISS models show a big deep bias exceeding 400 m

PICES Scientific Report No. 40  45 
in the northwestern Pacific area, and IAP-FGOALS- 
g1.0 has an unrealistically uniform spatial pattern at 
high latitudes.  Third, we further eliminated 4 models 
(BCCR-BCM2.0, CSIRO-MK3.0, GFDL-CM2.1, 
and INGV-ECHAM4) whose data were not available 
from the PCMDI archive for estimation of net heat 
flux or wind stress. In total, 14 of 25 models were 
excluded from our analysis. 
 
Although ensemble runs initialized with slightly 
different conditions are available for some models, 
just one realization (mostly “run 1”) for each model 
was used for both the 20th and 21st centuries, 
focusing on multi-model comparison.  All the model 
results were interpolated to a common 2.5° longitude 
× 2.5° latitude grid where multi-model ensemble 
means and standard deviations were calculated. To 
assess model performance in 20th century climate, the 
simulated MLD from each model was compared with 
observational estimates by de Boyer Montégut et al. 
(2004; available from http://www.locean-ipsl.upmc.fr/ 
~cdblod/mld.html) which uses the same MLD 
definition, providing direct comparison between 
model MLDs and the observation. 
 
This study used the t-test (also known as the Student’s 
t-test; von Storch and Zwiers, 1999) to evaluate the 
statistical significance of changes in each model and 
multi-model ensemble means.  For the multi-model 
ensemble mean of 20th century MLD, the t-test 
estimates its significance under the null hypothesis 
that each model has the same value as the multi-model 
mean.  For mean changes in each model, significance 
was calculated by the t-test with unequal variance that 
states variance of the 21st MLD differs from that of 
the 20th MLD. A paired t-test (also called 
“repeated-measures” t-test; von Storch and Zwiers, 
1999) was used to check whether the multi-model 
mean of mean MLD changes is significant or not.

Definition of mixed layer depth 
Among various methods for MLD estimation, this 
study utilizes the variable density threshold method 
(Sprintall and Tomczak, 1992) which considers 
salinity stratification that is not negligible at high 
latitudes, as well as temperature effects on 
stratification.  This method defines MLD as the depth 
where the density increase compared to density at  
10 m depth equals an increase in density equivalent to 
a temperature decrease of 0.2°C. This MLD 
estimation method has been widely used for various 
studies, including observational estimation (e.g., de 
Boyer Montégut et al., 2004) and verification of 
simulated upper ocean density structure (e.g., Jang 
and Kang, 2009).  Another common method for MLD 
estimation uses a fixed density criterion which defines 
MLD as depth where density increase compared to 
density at 10 m depth equals 0.03 kg m
–3
.  Compared 
with the fixed density criterion, the criterion used in 
this study tends to estimate deeper winter MLD by up 
to 30 m south of 40°N, while estimating shallower 
winter MLD north of 40°N by up to 30 m. 
 
Entrainment production  
After the MLD reaches its minimum in summer, 
gradual deepening of the mixed layer will entrain 
nutrients from below.  The entrained nutrients are 
consumed and transformed to organic matter during 
the course of the year.  The amount of nutrients 
available for primary production in the sun-lit surface 
layer will depend upon the seasonal excursion of the 
surface mixed layer.  Although seasonal entrainment 
of nutrients from the deep water might be a major 
source of new production in the middle latitudes 
(Yentsch, 1990), there are other sources of nutrients 
that can be altered under global warming.  CMIP3 
models do not provide enough information on other 
sources, such as typhoons, upon which predictions 
can be built.  Therefore, we will focus on seasonal 
entrainment of nutrients from the deep water and call 
this portion of new production “entrainment 
production” to distinguish it from productions due to 
other sources.  Since entrainment production depends 
on the seasonal excursion of the mixed layer, it will 
decrease if MLD becomes shallower. In this analysis, 
we assumed the following.  First, only the nutrient 
supply from entrainment of the deeper water due to 
seasonal deepening of the surface layer was 
considered.  Other processes such as nitrogen fixation, 
upwelling related to eddies and typhoons, and 
atmospheric inputs were not considered.  Second, all 
the nutrients entrained into the surface layer is 
transformed to organic carbon during the year.  Third, 
nitrogen is considered the major limiting nutrient and 
only nitrate is considered in calculating primary 
production.  
 
We calculated entrainment production at 4 × 10 grid 
cells in the Kuroshio Extension (KE) region  
(Fig. 3.4.A1).  The cells are spaced in a 30.5–39.5°N 
and 151.5–178.5°E rectangle at an interval of 3°. The 
following equations were used to estimate 
entrainment production from the nitrogen entrained 
from deepening of the mixed layer.

the vertical profile of nitrate when the MLD is at its 
annual minimum (i.e., summer) and PP is the annual 
entrainment production expressed in carbon and is 
obtained from PN by multiplying by the Redfield ratio 
and carbon atomic mass.  To estimate N(z) at each 
grid cell, monthly climatologies (1° grid) of nitrate 
were derived from the on-line version of the World 
Ocean Atlas 2009 (Garcia et al., 2010; available at 
http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOA05/pr_woa09.
html).  At each grid cell, nitrate profiles were obtained 
from standard depths (0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 125, 
150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500 m).  The density profiles 
from each grid cell were examined and the month of 
minimum MLD was chosen to select the nitrate 
profile.  Figure 3.4.A2 shows an example of nitrate 
profiles that are used for calculating the entrainment 
production for CSRIO-MK3.5.  The profiles are from 
the months when the MLDs reach their minimum at 
each grid point.  Since the time of minimum MLD can 
be different depending on the model and location, the 
pattern of nitrate profiles can be different for each 
model.  The same climatology of nitrate profiles is 
used for the future assuming the changes in the profile 
would be relatively small when nitrate is integrated 
through depth.

Timing of spring bloom initiation 
The timing of spring bloom initiation was calculated 
at the same grid cells as with entrained production 
(Fig. 3.4.A1).  As a proxy of the timing of the seasonal 
bloom initiation, we calculated the time when the 
MLD becomes shallower than the critical depth 
according to the concept first proposed by Sverdrup 
(1953).  The exact calculation was made following the 
formulation of Nelson and Smith (1991),

Results 
 
Winter MLD in the present climate and its projected 
change 
In the North Pacific, winter mixing of the surface 
layers controls the amount of nutrients entrained into 
the upper ocean which supports phytoplankton 
growth.  In addition, the winter mixing is essential to 
the formation of the mode waters that determine the 
property of the thermocline water and connect the 
  
upper ocean to the deep ocean (Hanawa and Talley, 
2001).  Therefore, this study investigates the winter 
MLD averaged over January, February, and March. 
 
The observed winter MLD presents significant spatial 
variations north of 25°N, while it is nearly uniform 
south of 25°N (Fig. 3.4.A4, the last panel).  The 
deepest MLDs exceeding 200 m are found between 
25°N and 40°N in the western North Pacific.  The 
observed winter MLD features three local maxima 
exceeding 125 m:  the first in the eastern subtropical 
Pacific centered at 140°W and 30°N, the second and 
third in the Northwest Pacific.  All three deep mixed 
layers are associated with mode water formation. The 
first local maximum corresponds to the region where 
eastern subtropical mode water (ESTMW) forms 
(Hosoda et al., 2001).  The second, centered near 
150°E and 32°N, is associated with subtropical mode 
water (STMW), and the third, near 180° and 40°N, is 
related with central mode water (CMW). 
 
Most models simulate a large MLD in the ESTMW 
region, with slightly different values and locations, 
except MIUB-ECHO-G and MRI-CGCM2.3.2 which 
show no distinct local maximum.  On the other hand, 
the other two maxima tend to coalesce into one large 
region in the KE in most models, which is due to 
overshooting of the Kuroshio in the low-resolution 
models (Thompson and Cheng, 2008), while 
MIROC3.2 (hires) and MPI-ECHAM5 have a distinct 
signature for the two maxima with different locations. 
Moreover, the simulated deep mixed layers in the KE 
are overestimated by 50 m (CSIRO-MK3.5) ~ 380 m 
(GFDL-CM2.0) compared with the observation.  This 
deep bias in the KE is probably due to underestimation 
of the Kuroshio which carries less heat into the KE 
region and thus less stratification, giving a deep MLD 
bias there (Thompson and Cheng, 2008).

available from http://www.locean-ipsl.upmc.fr/~cdblod/mld.html).  The shading intervals are 25 m from 0 to 150 m, and  
50 m for larger values.

standard deviation.  For multi-model mean, the regions statistically insignificant at 95% level are stippled. 
Multi-model mean MLD (Fig. 3.4.A5a) reflects well 
the general features in individual models: deep MLD 
in the KE and in the ESTMW formation region.  It 
also carries the common MLD biases from individual 
models:  a deep bias and one deep larger MLD region 
rather than the observed two localized maxima in the 
KE, which is inherent from low resolution in most of 
the CMIP3 models.  
 
Significant inter-model differences (greater than 
90 m) are observed in the mid-latitude between 
160°E~160°W and 30°~40°N, with its maximum 
exceeding 110 m centered at 180°, 32°N (Fig. 
3.4.A5b).  A deep mixed layer (> 300 m) extends to 
the east of 180° longitude in some models, including 
GFDL-CM2.0, while it is limited west of 180° 
longitude in the models, including NCAR-CCSM3 
and UKMO-HadCM3, resulting in a dominant inter- 
model variability near 180° longitude.  The largest 
inter-model MLD difference roughly corresponds to 
the region of the largest inter-model variability of the 
wind stress (not shown).  This implies that a large 
component of inter-model MLD difference results 
from a different wind stress in each model. 
Activities of Working Group Members  Section 3 
50  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
MLD in the 21st century decreases in most regions of 
the North Pacific, while the spatial distribution of the 
MLD is nearly unchanged (Figs. 3.4.A6 and 3.4.A7). 
The overall shoaling results largely from intensified 
upper-ocean stratification caused by amplified surface 
warming and freshening (Luo et al., 2009). 
 
Significant MLD decreases (> 30 m) are found in two 
regions: one in the KE, and the other in the region 
centered at 140°W and 30°N.  The consistent shoaling 
of the mixed layer in the KE roughly matches with the 
region of significantly weakened wind stress  
(Fig. 3.4.A8a), implying that the decreased MLD in 
the KE is mainly attributable to the weakened wind 
stress over the KE.  In association with reduced wind, 
latent cooling is reduced, resulting in diminished net 
surface cooling in the KE (Fig. 3.4.A8b).  This 
additionally helps reduce MLD in the KE.  
 
On the other hand, the MLD increases in the 
narrow-banded region between 40°~45°N and west of 
160°W, just north of the KE front.  This deepening is 
largely driven by a northward shift of the KE rather 
than by intensification of surface cooling or wind 
mixing. In the multi-model means (Fig. 3.4.A8), the 
surface cooling is projected to be weakened and the 
wind intensifies slightly which cannot significantly 
contribute to the deepening.

Future primary production changes 
We estimated the annual entrainment production at 
each of 4 × 10 grid cells (Fig. 3.4.A1) for 20C and 
21C and calculated the percent change of the annual 
entrainment production of 21C to that of 20C for each 
of the11 CMIP3 models. In Figure 3.4.A9, boxplots of 
the percent changes from each model are shown along 
the four latitudes (see Figure 3.4.A1 for locations). 
The overall trend is that the entrainment production 
will decrease more towards the south (Fig. 3.4.A9). 
This trend is particularly pronounced with the models 
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 (MIROC3.2 (hires), MIROC3.2 
(medres), MIUB-ECHO-G, MPI-ECHAM5, MRI- 
CGCM2.3.2, and UKMO-HadCM3). Model 7 
(MIUB-ECHO-G) shows the largest percent change 
of decrease (median = –74.5%) along 30.5°N.  On the 
other hand, model 1 (CNRM-CM3) shows the largest 
decrease (median = –50.9%) in the middle latitudes. 
Models 2 and 10 (CSIRO-MK3.5 and NCAR- 
CCSM3) show small decreases (<15%) at all the 
latitudes. Models 7 and 11 (MIUB-ECHO-G and 
UKMO-HadCM3) show large decreases along 
30.5°N but very large increases (median = +55.5% 
and +118.3%, respectively) along 39.5°N.  When all 
the grid cells are pooled, median values of the percent 
change range from –10.6% (MRI-CGCM2.3.2) to 
–40.6% (GFDL-CM2.0). The largest percent 
decreases range from –40.0% (CSIRO-MK3.5) to 
–92.2% (MIUB-ECHO-G). The largest percent 
increases range from –4.0% (IPSL-CM4) to 311.6% 
(UKMO-HadCM3). 
Estimated time of spring bloom initiation, as 
approximated by crossing time of MLD and critical 
depth, shows a similar trend with the entrainment 
production (Fig. 3.4.A10). Blooms initiate earlier 
towards the south with models 5, 6, 7, 8 (MIROC3.2 
(hires), MIROC3.2 (medres), MIUB-ECHO-G, and 
MPI-ECHAM5).  On the other hand, blooms initiate 
along 39.5°N with models 4 and 10 (IPSL-CM4 and 
NCAR-CCSM3).  Models 7 and 11 (MIUB-ECHO-G 
and UKMO-HadCM3) show delayed spring blooms 
along 39.5°N. Thus models 7 and 11 (MIUB- 
ECHO-G and UKMO-HadCM3) show a very wide 
range of bloom timing shift (–3.2 to +2.4 weeks in 
model 7 and –1.5 to +2.9 weeks in model 11; negative 
values indicate advancement of bloom timing, 
positive delay). For all the grid cells combined, 
median values of the timing shift range from 0.0 
(MRI-CGCM2.3.2) to –1.7 weeks (MRI-CGCM2.3.2). 
Minimum values range from –0.9 (NCAR-CCSM3) to 
–5.7 weeks (MIROC3.2 (medres)). Maximum values 
range from 0.0 (NCAR-CCSM3) to +5.1 weeks 
(UKMO-HadCM3).  
 
To summarize, the overall trend is that the spring 
blooms initiate early but actual values differ very 
much, depending on the model and location. Similarly 
with entrainment production changes, some models 
show advancement in spring bloom initiation in all the 
areas while some models show mixed differences in 
differing magnitudes.

Discussion 
 
Despite significant differences in model 
configurations (e.g., resolution or subgrid-scale 
parameterization), most of the CMIP3 models used in 
this study project a consistent shoaling of the mixed 
layer in the KE, mainly driven by a consistent 
weakening of wind stress and the associated reduction 
in surface cooling over the KE.  One might argue that 
most CMIP3 models analyzed are not resolving 
meso-scale eddies that could be crucial for simulating 
the Kuroshio and its extension, and thus mixed layer 
depth, and their future changes. Noting that a 
consistent decrease in the KE is also projected in the 
MIROC3.2 (hires) model, with the highest model 
resolution among the CMIP3 models, it is not likely 
that model resolution could change the essential 
aspects of MLD projection in the KE, at least 
qualitatively.  
 
We have shown decreases in entrainment production 
and hence primary production in the 21st century in 
all the 11 CMIP3 models.  We now examine whether 
the method used here to determine entrainment 
production from the seasonal changes in MLD is 
reasonable.  We chose to use satellite-based primary 
production estimates as an independent comparison. 
Since most of the CMIP3 models overestimate MLD 
when compared with observed data, the resultant 
entrainment production will be overestimated 
accordingly. Therefore, we chose model 2 
(CSIRO-MK3.5, Table 3.4.A1), which shows the 
least overestimation, for comparison with the 
satellite-based estimates.  The satellite-based primary 
production was obtained from Oregon State University 
(http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productiv
ity/).  The satellite data used are by SeaWiFS (Sea- 
viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) which are 
available only for the period of 1997–2008.  We 
compared the entrainment production calculated from 
MLD changes for 1998 (July 1998 to June 1999) and 
1999 (July 1999 to June 2000) with satellite-based 
primary production in the same periods at the grid cells.  
 
There is a good relationship between the total primary 
production and entrainment production estimated 
from annual changes in MLD in the study area  
(Fig. 3.4.A11). MLD-based estimates of entrainment 
production account for 81.8% of the variance in total 
primary production of the study region, which 
includes oligotrophic to moderately-productive areas. 
We do not expect a quantitatively accurate 
relationship between the two because of the 
uncertainties in MLD estimates, nitrate profiles and 
satellite estimation of primary production.  In Figure 
3.4.A11, new production is estimated by multiplying 
the f-ratio (Eppley and Peterson, 1979) to the satellite 
primary production and is denoted by a broken line. 
When primary production is below approximately

, there are more overestimates. This is because the 
MLD projected by model 2 (CSIRO-MK3.5) 
overestimates in the north and underestimates in the 
south. Despite this systematic difference, the coherent 
relationship between entrainment production and 
satellite primary production suggests that MLD-based 
estimation of entrainment production can be applied 
to the MLD outputs of other CMIP3 models. 
 
The results of this analysis indicate that 11 CMIP3 
models give a wide range of differences.  Despite the 
similar overall trends, the magnitude of changes in 
primary production and timing of spring blooms were 
quite different, depending on models and latitudes. 
Hashioka and Yamanaka (2007) made projections on 
the ecosystem changes in the western North Pacific 
using a high resolution 3D ecosystem– 
biogeochemical model.  Their results were different 
from the results of this study in that change in primary 
production was smaller but advancement of spring 
bloom was larger. 
 
Yentch (1990) estimated new production from 
monthly nitrate profiles and concluded the estimates 
were reasonable compared to the observed values in 
the North Atlantic.  Although entrainment of deep 
nutrients may be the major source of primary 
production in the KE, we recognize other factors are 
also important and we differentiate entrainment 
production from new production.  In the KE region, 
eddies, typhoons, and nitrogen fixation may also be 
important contributions to new production in addition 
to the changes in entrainment production.  
 
Increases in water temperature and carbon dioxide can 
change new production in the future in the study area. 
We examine whether the increased temperature or 
carbon dioxide can enhance new production 
significantly.  The first possibility is that increased 
temperature can enhance nitrogen fixation.  Thus far, 
we only considered nitrate assimilation as sources of 
new production but nitrogen fixation could be 
potentially important in the new production in the 
subtropical North Pacific (Karl et al., 1997; Dore et 
al., 2002; Capone et al., 2005; Kitajima et al., 2009). 
Nitrogen is fixed by diazotrophs such as 
Trichodesmium, which are broadly distributed in 
oligotrophic, tropical, and subtropical oceans (Capone 
et al., 1997).  Nitrogen fixation by Trichodesmium 
Section 3 Activities of Working Group Members  
PICES Scientific Report No. 40  55 
corresponds to half or more of the upward nitrate flux 
(at Station ALOHA; western subtropical and tropical 
North Atlantic) and accounts for up to 47% of the 
primary production in the tropical North Atlantic 
Ocean (Carpenter et al., 2004). 
 
Two questions are raised in considering the possibility 
of an increase in nitrogen fixation in 21C.  The first is 
whether the range of temperature increase projected 
by the models can enhance the new production 
significantly.  Maximum specific growth rates of the 
axenic Trichodesmium IMS-101 strain were highest 
in the temperature range between 24–30°C, with a 
peak at 27°C (Breitbarth et al., 2007).  Hence if the 
temperature increases towards the optimal value, 
nitrogen fixation can increase. However, small 
changes in temperature (4°C) did not appear to affect 
gross nitrogen fixation in cultures of Trichodesmium 
IMS101 (Mulholland and Bernhardt, 2005; Hutchins 
et al., 2007).  The temperature increase from the 
models ranges from 2.2–3.3°C (annual means) and 
1.9–4.0°C (annual maximum). Therefore, the 
projected temperature increases may not lead to a 
significant increase in nitrogen fixation. 
 
The second question is whether the temperature 
increase alone can enhance the new production 
significantly. Studies have shown that nitrogen 
fixation can be limited by iron (Raven, 1988; Rueter 
et al., 1990; Falkowski, 1997) and by phosphorus 
(Wu et al., 2000; Sañudo-Wilhelmy et al., 2001; 
Moutin et al., 2005; Mulholland and Bernhardt, 2005; 
Kitajima et al., 2009).  Mahaffey et al. (2005) further 
argued that nitrogen fixation activity is primarily 
regulated by iron and/or phosphorus availability.  The 
study of Kitajima et al. (2009) in the western North 
Pacific supports this view.  The whole-water nitrogen 
fixation was markedly elevated in winter throughout 
the study area compared to that in summer, probably 
due to the increased upward supply of phosphate as a 
result of a deeper mixed layer in winter (Kitajima et 
al., 2009).  In a similar vein, the effects of increased 
carbon dioxide on nitrogen fixation can be evaluated. 
Hutchins et al. (2007) reported that chlorophyll-a 
normalized nitrogen fixation rates of Pacific and 
Atlantic isolates increased 35 to 100% at projected 
carbon dioxide levels of the year 2100 (76 Pa, 750 
ppm), even under severely P-limited steady-state 
growth conditions, relative to present day carbon 
dioxide conditions.  Whether this can be extended to a 
longer time scale (such as annual growth) is 
questionable, as nitrogen fixation will eventually be 
limited by iron and/or phosphorus availability.

Although CMIP3 models do not provide data to 
evaluate the impacts of future changes in typhoons 
and eddies on primary production, eddies (Kimura et 
al., 2000) and typhoons (Siswanto et al., 2007) can 
contribute to the new production in the western North 
Pacific.  Therefore, it is desirable to evaluate other 
sources of new production. 
 
     
Conclusions 
 
This study finds consistent mixed layer depth (MLD) 
changes in the future in the North Pacific Ocean from 
all the 11 CMIP3 models: a shoaling in the Kuroshio 
Extension (KE) region and a deepening north of the 
Kuroshio Front.  The shoaling is attributable to the 
weakening in wind stress and the associated decrease 
in ocean cooling in the KE, while the deepening is 
mainly driven by the northward shift of the KE. 
However, the detailed structures and magnitudes in 
the MLD changes are substantially different across 
the models, reflecting significantly different model 
configurations including model resolutions, sub-grid 
mixing parameterization, and model physics.  The 
differences are accordingly reflected in primary 
production on local scales. 
 
The entrained production, which may be the major 
component of primary production in the region, was 
estimated based on MLD changes in the KE.  The 
entrainment production in the KE in 21C will be 
decreased by 10.7~40.3% (range of 11 median values) 
and spring blooms will occur 0.0~1.7 week (range of 
11 median values) earlier in response to the changes 
in MLD in the KE region.  Despite the overall trends, 
the magnitude of changes in primary production and 
timing of spring blooms were quite different, 
depending on models and latitudes. 
 
The above findings suggest that the CMIP3 projected 
changes in the MLD and related changes in primary 
production in the North Pacific are quantitatively very 
different, although they are qualitatively agreeable. 
To clarify the causes of the differences is necessary at 
least for some models provided with detailed 
information, and is planned as a future research 
theme.

Introduction 
 
The mixed layer is the ocean surface zone that 
responds most quickly and directly to atmospheric 
fluxes, and it is through the mixed layer that heat and 
momentum fluxes are transmitted to the deeper ocean 
and generate longer timescales of variability. 
Therefore, the ocean’s mixed layer depth (hereafter 
referred to as MLD) is one of the most important 
quantities in the upper ocean, and is closely associated 
with physical, chemical and biological systems 
(Fasham, 1995; Kara et al., 2003). MLD variability 
dominates on several short-term timescales, i.e., 
diurnal, intra-seasonal, and seasonal (McCreary et al., 
2001). However, recent studies of long-term 
observation records have suggested that the MLD 
undergoes low-frequency changes in the North 
Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Carton et al., 2008). In 
addition, a number of studies have reported a 
long-term trend in MLD (Polovina et al., 1995; 
Chepurin and Carton, 2002; Carton et al., 2008). Such 
low-frequency variability and the shallowing or 
deepening trend in the MLD over the past few 
decades have raised the question of whether, and how, 
human-induced ‘greenhouse’ warming impacts MLD 
variability.  
 
The variability of the MLD under global warming 
would determine a physical environment in the upper 
ocean that could affect ocean–atmosphere interactions, 
ocean physics and upper ocean productivity (Pierce, 
2004).  In particular, as the site of significant climate 
variability, the MLD closely links the dynamics and 
thermodynamics of the upper layers in the tropical 
Pacific and, as such, is likely to be a key parameter for 
understanding the response of the tropical Pacific 
climate system to global warming.   In spite of a large 
number of studies on the influence of climate change 
using Coupled General Circulation Models (CGCMs) 
(see http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/subproject_ 
publications.php), there has been little investigation 
of changes in MLD under climate change projections. 
We examine changes in MLD under atmospheric CO
2
 
doubling in two different CGCMs, focusing on 
changes in MLD in the tropical Pacific.  Furthermore, 
we examine changes in the relationship between the 
MLD and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
under increased greenhouse gases. Indeed, the 
variability associated with heat storage or release in 
the mixed layer is quite diverse due to competition 
between the equatorial waves and the direct heat flux 
forcing in the tropical Pacific.  This balance is likely 
to be sensitive to the environmental conditions in a 
way that depends on MLD characteristics. More 
generally, since the MLD determines the heat 
capacity of the ocean, it has a strong impact on air–sea 
exchanges, and therefore on ENSO, which includes its 
teleconnections (Sui et al., 2005).  For these reasons it 
is worthwhile examining changes in the MLD–ENSO 
relationship under increased CO
2
 concentrations.  In 
order to analyze changes in the MLD under 
atmospheric CO
2
 doubling, we examined two 
CGCMs: a control simulation using pre-industrial 
greenhouse gas concentrations and an experiment 
simulation using doubled CO
2
 levels.  
 
 
Model and Methodology 
 
We used selected CGCM simulations, namely, 
MRI-CGCM2.3.2a and GFDL-CM2_0 (hereafter 
referred to as MRI and GFDL). The CGCM 
simulations were made available by the Program for 
Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison 
(PCMDI) on the website http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ 
ipcc/about_ipcc.php.  In this study, the MLD was 
obtained from Monterey and Levitus (1997) and Suga 
et al. (2004) based on the depth where the density 
differs from the surface density by 0.125 kg m
–3
.  We 
chose a density difference criterion because salinity 
Activities of Working Group Members  Section 3 
58  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
also contributes to the density variation significantly 
in the tropical Pacific.  Note that small change of the 
surface density criteria leads to slight differences in 
the estimation of MLD but the overall results are 
unchanged. The terms “control experiment” and 
“2xCO2 experiment” refer to data from the last 100 
years for the control experiment and the 2xCO2 
experiment, respectively.  
 
 
MLD in the Control Experiment 
 
Prior to showing the MLD simulated in the CGCMs, 
we begin by showing the climatological annual mean 
MLD in observations. Figure 3.4.B1a shows the 
climatological mean MLD in the tropical Pacific 
calculated from the Levitus data (Levitus, 1982). 
Mean MLD ranges from 20 to 80 m in the tropical 
Pacific. A shallow MLD is found in the eastern 
tropical Pacific, which is associated with a shallow 
thermocline depth in the same region (Yu and 
McPhaden, 1999).  In the central equatorial Pacific 
the spatial structure of the mean MLD is characterized 
by a pair of deep MLDs off the equator in both 
hemispheres, which is similar to the results obtained 
by Kara et al. (2003) and de Boyer Montegut et al. 
(2004) in spite of different definitions of MLD.  Using 
the data from the World Ocean Database 2005 archive 
for the period 1960–2004, Carton et al. (2008) 
showed that the climatological maximum MLD may 
exceed 75 m in the central tropical Pacific basin, 
decreasing to less than 40 m in the east, which is also 
generally consistent with Figure 3.4.B1a. A deep 
MLD in the central equatorial Pacific could be 
associated with significant vertical turbulent kinetic 
energy due to strong zonal wind stress over this zone 
(Garwood et al., 1985).  On the other hand, upwelling 
at the equator drags up the thermocline, and thus 
causes the decrease in MLD compared to the 
off-equatorial region, although it is not clearly 
observed in the climatological data of low resolution 
(Noh et al., 2005). The MLD pattern is also associated 
with equatorial wave dynamics.  Strong zonal wind 
stress in the central equatorial Pacific (Wittenberg, 
2004) produces strong upwelling off the equator in 
both hemispheres.  This is mainly due to an Ekman 
pumping by wind stress curl off the equator in both 
hemispheres (Kessler, 2006), resulting in a deep MLD 
through active mixing processes, as seen in Figure 
3.4.B1a. On the other hand, an Ekman pumping 
continuously forces a Rossby wave propagating to the 
west (Qu et al., 2008); therefore, the variability of the 
MLD is closely associated with equatorial wave 
dynamics in the central equatorial Pacific from the 
forcing region, in particular the annual equatorial 
Rossby wave in which its maximum center is located 
off the equator (Kessler and McCreary, 1999) or the 
tropical instability wave activity that can also rectify 
the background state. 
 
Figure 3.4.B1b and c is the same as Figure 3.4.B1a but 
relates to the control experiments in the MRI model 
and the GFDL model, respectively.  The spatial 
structure of the mean MLD simulated in both the MRI 
model and the GFDL model is dominated by a pair of 
deep MLDs which are at a maximum off the equator 
in the western and central equatorial Pacific, which is 
in agreement with the observations.  However, the 
pattern is much more symmetric towards the equator, 
suggesting that equatorial Rossby waves have a 
greater impact on MLD variability in the CGCMs 
than in the observations. In addition, the mean MLD 
simulated in the MRI model is shallow, below 50 m, 
along the equator in the central tropical Pacific 
compared to the observations, which may be largely 
due to strong upwelling along the equator. Meridional 
sections of climatological annual mean temperature 
(not shown), indeed, indicate a sharp rise in the 
isotherms at the equator in the MRI model. In the 
GFDL model, on the other hand, the MLD peaks at 
100 m near the dateline which is 20~30 m greater than 
in the observations and the MRI model.  Note also that 
the location of the maximum MLD is significantly 
shifted to the west in the GFDL model as compared to 
the observations and MRI model.  These model biases 
may be associated with deficiencies in the mixed- 
layer physics used.

MLD in the 2xCO2 Experiment 
 
The mean MLD under the increased greenhouse gases 
scenario in the two CGCMs is presented in  
Figure 3.4.B2a and b.  The panels can be compared to 
Figure 3.4.B1b and c (i.e., the control experiments).  
There is similarity in the spatial pattern of the mean 
MLD between the two experiments for both CGCMs, 
namely a pair of deep MLDs which are at a maximum 
off the equator in the western and central equatorial 
Pacific, and a shallow MLD in the eastern tropical 
Pacific.  In the tropical Pacific, the mean MLD ranges 
from 20 to 50m in the MRI model and from 20 to 80 m 
in the GFDL model.  The greatest differences in mean 
MLD between the two experiments in the MRI and 
GFDL models are found in the central and western 
equatorial Pacific, respectively, consisting in a 
shallowing of 5 to 30 m.  The maximum difference of 
mean MLD between the control and the 2xCO2 
experiments (not shown) is observed in the region of 
the deepest simulated MLD in the control experiment 
in both models, that is, off the equator (i.e., 2~3 °N and 
2~3°S) around the central equatorial Pacific 
(180°E–150 °W) in the MRI model and in the western 
equatorial Pacific (150 °–180 °E) in the GFDL model. 
For more details we have also provided the ratio of 
mean MLD between the control experiment and the 
2xCO2 experiment in the MRI (Fig. 3.4.B2c) and 
GFDL (Fig. 3.4.B2d) models.  This ratio is less than 1 
over most of the basin for both models (the exceptions 
Activities of Working Group Members  Section 3 
60  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
are a region around the northeastern tropical Pacific 
for the MRI model, and in the south-central tropical 
Pacific for the GFDL model), indicative of shallowing 
of the MLD under global warming.  Interestingly, the 
ratios of MLD changes are not homogeneous in the 
MRI model, unlike the GFDL model which exhibits a 
more uniform pattern.  The MLD changes in the MRI 
model are projected to be large in the central 
equatorial Pacific with an off-equatorial maximum in 
both hemispheres (Fig. 3.4.B2c).  In contrast, the 
MLD changes are small in the eastern equatorial 
Pacific, where the ratio values are around 0.8~0.9.  On 
the other hand, the ratio values for MLD changes in 
the GFDL model are nearly uniform in the equatorial 
Pacific, where they are around 0.8~0.9 over most of 
the basin.  These results indicate first, that changes in 
the MLD due to climate warming do not respond 
linearly in the equatorial Pacific (cf. the MRI model, 
which exhibits very distinct patterns of MLD in both 
experiments) and second, that there is great 
uncertainty about the MLD changes under climate 
change projections, considering the above-mentioned 
differences between both models.

Relationship between the MLD and Mean SST 
 
The fact that the GFDL model simulates a deeper 
MLD than the MRI model in the control experiment 
(i.e., Fig. 3.4.B1b and c) may influence the response 
of the tropical Pacific mean sea surface temperature 
(SST) to global warming in the two CGCMs. By 
definition, the mixed layer is the quasi-homogenous 
region of the upper ocean in terms of physical 
quantities like temperature and salinity.  Therefore, a 
deep or shallow MLD may influence changes in mean 
SST through the homogenous distribution of heat flux 
forcing induced by global warming.  
 
Changes in mean SST from the control experiment to 
the 2xCO2 experiment (i.e., 2xCO2 minus the 
control) in the MRI and GFDL models are shown in 
Fig. 3.4.B3a and b, respectively.  The two models 
exhibit El Niño-like warming trends under the 
doubled CO
2
 concentrations and have quite different 
characteristics.  Whereas in the MRI model the 
warming is projected to be considerable over a large 
portion of the central and eastern tropical Pacific, the 
warming in the GFDL model is centered along the 
equator in the central and far eastern Pacific.  In 
addition, the tropical Pacific mean SST increases by 
about 2.6 to 3.6°C in the 2xCO2 experiment for the 
MRI model, which is almost double the increase in the 
GFDL model (i.e., 1.6~1.8°C).  This indicates that the 
climate sensitivity (the equilibrium mean temperature 
change following a doubling of the atmospheric CO
2
 
concentration) is different in the two CGCMs. Our 
results suggest that the deeper the mean MLD 
simulated in the control simulation, the less the 
warming rate of mean SST simulated in the 2xCO2 
experiment (cf. Figs. 3.4.B2 and 3.4.B3).  In order to 
examine the possibility that the heat flux differences 
between the two CGCMs can make a contribution to 
mean SST changes in the 2xCO2 experiment, we 
display the differences of the heat fluxes in the two 
CGCMs (i.e., the MRI model minus the GFDL 
model) in the control experiment and the 2xCO2 
experiment, respectively (Fig. 3.4.B4a and b).  If the 
heat flux differences between the two CGCMs are 
comparable in the two experiments, one may 
conclude that the differences in MLD can be 
considered responsible for the different warming in 
the two CGCMs.  Figure 3.4.B4a and b indicates that 
the net heat flux in the MRI model is smaller than that 
in the GFDL model in most regions of the equatorial 
Pacific for both the control experiment and the 2xCO2 
experiment, which means that the ocean absorbs more 
heat flux from the atmosphere in the GFDL model 
than in the MRI model in both experiments. 
Furthermore, the net heat flux differences in the two 
CGCMs are comparable in the equatorial Pacific 
between the control experiment (Fig. 3.4.B4a) and the 
2xCO2 experiment (Fig. 3.4.B4b), supporting the 
view that the heat flux differences between the two 
CGCMs make a small contribution to mean SST 
changes from the control experiment to the 2xCO2 
experiment.  
 
In a warmer climate, a shallowing of the MLD is 
expected in association with a more stratified ocean. 
Indeed, when the climate warms, the ocean’s surface 
becomes warmer and the water column tends to 
stabilize.  This suggests that different ratios of MLD 
shallowing under global warming in the MRI and 
GFDL models are related to different SST warming 
rates (Fig. 3.4.B3a and b).  The shallowing of the 
MLD is greater in the MRI model than in the GFDL 
model, and this is associated with greater warming of 
mean SST in the MRI model than in the GFDL model. 
As we argue above, the deeper the mean MLD 
simulated in the control simulation, the less the 
warming rate of mean SST simulated in the 2xCO2 
experiment.  The reduced warming rate of mean SST 
then results in less shallowing of the MLD simulated 
in the 2xCO2 experiment.  These results illustrate the 
feedback process of the MLD–SST changes from the 
control experiment to the 2xCO2 experiment. For 
instance, a shallow MLD in the control experiment is 
associated with relatively large SST warming through 
more global-warming-induced heat flux trapped 
around the near surface layer in the 2xCO2 
experiment.  This leads to a more stratified ocean. A 
large change in stability is associated with a 
significant MLD shallowing rate which, in turn, feeds 
back on the tendency of SST to increase under heat 
flux induced by global warming.  Such processes are 
reversed for a deeper MLD in the control experiment. 
Figure 3.4.B5 displays a schematic of such a feedback 
process in the MLD–SST changes.  We argue here 
that the MLD is a key parameter for regulating the 
response of tropical Pacific mean SST due to 
increasing greenhouse gases in a CGCM.  On the 
other hand, equatorial wave dynamics also enables us 
to understand the variation of the tropical Pacific on 
interannual and longer times scales as well as the 
mean state.  Therefore, in the next subsection we 
examine the impact of climate change associated with 
MLD variability on some aspects of oceanic 
dynamical processes.

Relationship between the MLD and ENSO 
 
According to previous studies, the predominant 
pattern of MLD variability in the tropical Pacific is 
coherent with ENSO (Carton et al., 2008). To 
examine MLD variability associated with ENSO in 
the two experiments, we begin by showing the 
standard deviation of total sea surface temperature 
anomaly (SSTA) simulated in the control experiment 
(Fig. 3.4.B6) in the two CGCMs.  The anomaly is 
defined as the deviation from the mean annual cycle 
calculated over the analyzed period without removing 
any trends.  For comparison, we show the same results 
based on the monthly mean observed SST data from 
the National Climate Data Center (Smith and 
Reynolds, 2004) for the period of 1901–2005  
(Fig. 3.4.B6a).  The SSTA standard deviation for the 
MRI model (Fig. 3.4.B6b) and the GFDL model  
(Fig. 3.4.B6c) has a maximum center in the central 
and eastern tropical Pacific, respectively, which 
differs somewhat in terms of spatial structure and 
amplitude compared to observations.  Both models 
simulate SSTA variability that extends too far into the 
western Pacific compared to observations. The 
composite of El Niño during the boreal winter (not 
shown), which is defined when the NINO3.4 SST 
index during winter is above its one standard 
deviation, also shows that the maximum SST center 
of the simulated El Niño from both models extends to 
the west compared to the observations.  Note that the 
NINO3.4 SST index is defined as the time series of  
the SSTA averaged over the region 5°N–5 °S, 
170°E–240 °E. The standard deviation of the NINO3.4 
SST index is 0.66 °C for the MRI model, 0.98 °C for 
the GFDL model and 0.74°C for the observations. A 
power spectral analysis of the simulated NINO3.4 
SST index (not shown) indicates a spectral peak 
around 24 months in the MRI model for the control 
run, which is shorter than that in the GFDL model (i.e., 
37 months; see also van Oldenborgh et al. (2005).

Fig. 3.4.B6 (a) is the standard deviation of SSTA variability for the observations for the period of 1901–2005. (b) and  
(c) are the same as in (a) except for the control experiment for (b) the MRI model and (c) the GFDL model.  Contour interval 
is 0.2 °C. 
 
 
In order to isolate the variability of the MLD 
associated with ENSO, the simultaneous linear 
regression coefficients between the MLD anomaly 
and the NINO3.4 SST index were estimated for both 
models (Fig. 3.4.B7a and b).  The MLD anomaly is 
defined by the deviation from the climatological 
annual cycle over the entire analyzed period. The 
most obvious pattern of MLD anomalies in the 
equatorial Pacific, associated with ENSO, is a zonal 
see-saw to the east and west of 150 °~160°W in both 
CGCMs.  During a warm event, the MLD is shallow 
(deep) in the central-western (eastern) tropical Pacific. 
The spatial patterns of Fig. 3.4.B7a and b resemble the 
structure of the mean MLD (see Fig. 3.4.B2) although 
in the GFDL model they are less symmetrical towards 
the equator.  These structures are closely related to 
anomalous zonal wind stress associated with ENSO 
(Fig. 3.4.B7c and d). During a warm event, anomalous 
eastward zonal wind stress forces equatorial 
downwelling Kelvin waves and upwelling Rossby 
waves.  The latter is associated with the shallower 
MLD off the equator. Since anomalous wind stress is 
not centered on the equator (i.e., is slightly to the 
south), cyclonic wind stress curl off the equator is 
expected to effectively amplify the upwelling in the 
southern hemisphere more than in the northern 
hemisphere.  This results in a larger amplitude of 
regressed MLD on ENSO variability in the southern 
hemisphere in both CGCMs compared to the northern 
hemisphere (Fig. 3.4.B7a and b).  Furthermore, the 
maximum center of regressed zonal wind stress is 
displaced to the west in the GFDL model  
(Fig. 3.4.B7d) compared to the MRI model  
(Fig. 3.4.B7c).  This causes the maximum amplitude 
of regressed MLD to shift to the west in the GFDL 
model compared to the MRI model.

To further investigate the relationship between the 
MLD and ENSO, we present a scatter diagram 
comparing the MLD anomalies averaged over 
5 °N–5 °S, 150 °W–150°E (hereafter referred to as the 
MLD index) and the NINO3.4 SST index in the 
control experiment for the MRI model and the GFDL 
model, respectively (Fig. 3.4.B8a and b). The 
averaged region for the MLD index is based on the 
above maps of simultaneous linear regression 
coefficients (Fig. 3.4.B7a and b).  As can be seen in 
Fig. 3.4.B8a and b, there is a clear negative 
relationship between the MLD index and the 
NINO3.4 SST index in both CGCMs. The 
simultaneous correlation between the two indices is 
–0.88 and –0.77 in the MRI model and the GFDL 
model, respectively, which exceeds the 95% 
confidence level.  Simply put, Figure 3.4.B8 indicates 
that the stronger El Niño (La Niña), the shallower

(deeper) the MLD in the western and central tropical 
Pacific.  It is worth noting that an asymmetry of the 
relationship between the MLD index and the 
NINO3.4 SST index appears in the GFDL model 
compared to the MRI model. The correlation 
coefficient between the positive (negative) NINO3.4 
SST index and the MLD index is –0.82 (–0.27) in the 
GFDL model, whereas the correlation coefficient 
between the positive (negative) NINO3.4 SST index 
and the MLD index is –0.77 (–0.67) in the MRI model, 
respectively.  The low correlation during La Niña in 
the GFDL model may reflect that the MLD in the 
western tropical Pacific is already deep in the GFDL 
model, as shown in Figure 3.4.B1c, and its increase 
during La Niña shows much larger scattering.  We 
further speculate that such a difference is associated 
with the difference in the mean state of the tropical 
Pacific between the two CGCMs (namely, the 
climatological mean SST is warmer in the western 
and central equatorial Pacific in the GFDL model than 
in the MRI model (not shown)). Therefore, anomalous 
surface temperature, which is closely associated with 
the variation of MLD, may be different when the same 
magnitude of El Niño or La Niña occurs in the MRI 
model and the GFDL model. 
 
Changes in ENSO amplitude under an increase in CO
2
 
concentrations are quite different in the MRI model 
and the GFDL model. The SSTA standard deviation is 
markedly increased in the 2xCO2 experiment for the 
MRI model. The standard deviation of the NINO3.4 
SST index is 1.11 °C in the 2xCO2 experiment, which 
is significantly larger than that in the control 
experiment (i.e., 0.66°C).  In contrast, in the GFDL 
model ENSO amplitude is slightly reduced from the 
control experiment to the 2xCO2 experiment. The 
standard deviation of the NINO3.4 SST index is 
0.98°C (0.88 °C) in the control (2xCO2) experiment in 
the GFDL model.  In order to show changes in the 
relationship between MLD and ENSO under global 
warming, we applied the same analysis as the one 
used to derive Figure 3.4.B8 in the 2xCO2 experiment. 
Results are presented in Figure 3.4.B9. Similar to the 
control experiment, the MLD index is highly 
negatively correlated with the NINO3.4 SST index in 
the 2xCO2 experiment for the MRI model 
(simultaneous correlation coefficient, –0.89). 
However, one may find there are subtle differences 
between Figures 3.4.B8 and 3.4.B9 when the 
amplitude of the NINO3.4 SST index is large.  For 
instance, the MLD does not deepen as much as in the 
2xCO2 experiment compared to the control 
experiment when the NINO3.4 SST index reaches 
large values. Note also that a simultaneous correlation 
coefficient between the two indices is –0.31 when

Fig. 3.4.B9 (a) and (b) are the same as in Fig. 3.4.B8a 
and b, except for the 2xCO2 experiment. 
 
 
the NINO3.4 SST index is above 2.0 °C in the 2xCO2 
experiment. Simply put, this result suggests that the 
non-linearity between the MLD and ENSO is 
enhanced from the control experiment to the 2xCO2 
experiment in the MRI model.  On the other hand, in 
the GFDL model there is little change in the 
relationship between the two indices from the control 
experiment (Fig. 3.4.B8b) to the 2xCO2 experiment 
(Fig. 3.4.B9b). The simultaneous correlation 
coefficient between the two indices is –0.77 in the 
control experiment and –0.76 in the 2xCO2 
experiment. In addition, a linear relationship between 
the MLD index and the NINO3.4 SST index can still 
be distinguished for large amplitude of El Niño.   Note 
that a simultaneous correlation coefficient between 
the two indices is –0.75 (–0.69) when the NINO3.4 
SST index is above 2.0 °C in the 2xCO2 experiment 
(control experiment). This result indicates that the 
linear relationship between the MLD index and ENSO 
is unchanged despite an increase in CO
2
 
concentrations.

3.5 Interactions between global climate and World Ocean ecosystems

Abstract 
 
The role of the World Ocean in global climate change is analyzed from two points of view: (1) heat energy 
accumulation and distribution in the ocean and its discharge into the atmosphere as purely physical processes; 
(2) participation of living matter in the ocean in these processes.  It is shown that living matter, especially 
phytoplankton, having  the ability to absorb solar energy, change water transparency and react not only to the 
flow of heat energy, but also to extra weak fluctuations of electromagnetic and magnetic fields generated by 
external and internal sources, can be considered as an active forcing of climate fluctuations observed on different 
scales. Several mechanisms of climate–ecosystem interactions are identified.  
 
 
Introduction 
 
Climate change (CC) and its consequences are among 
the critical problems for modern day civilization. Due 
to the complexity of the problem, investigations are 
carried out in many directions and by many national 
and international organizations. A very important part 
of the problem – the impact of CC on the World 
Ocean ecosystems – was the main objective of the 
PICES/GLOBEC Climate Change and Carrying 
Capacity(CCCC) program.  Significant results were 
obtained in modeling the processes of medium-scale 
living matter interactions and in observational data 
analysis.  However, practically all investigations were 
directed from a climate to ecosystem (CC forced 
effects) perspective and took into account only the 
effects of energy and mass transport in the systems. 
The main objectives here are to (1) show the active 
role and significance of living matter in climate– 
ecosystem interactions, including informational flows; 
(2) analyze the main factors and possible mechanisms 
of their quick interaction and slow co-evolution;  
(3) outline directions of studies that should be 
promoted in the near future. 
 
 
General Considerations 
 
First, it is necessary to specify the notions of global 
climate (GC) and global climate change (GCC).  We 
can define GC as the spatial–temporal distribution 
over the Globe of an ensemble of hydro- 
meteorological parameters (such as temperature, air 
pressure, winds, cloudiness, humidity, rainfall, 
seasonal variations) averaged over some conditional 
spatial and temporal scales L
a
 and T
a
.  Some 
uncertainty is inevitable in the notion.   “Distribution” 
should be used in a stochastic sense as probability 
distribution that can be described by moments of all 
orders (e.g., mean, dispersions, correlations, spectra, 
asymmetry).  The same is true for each parameter. 
Averaging scales L
a
 and T
a
 generally imply: (1) in 
space – regions with insignificant dispersions of 
climate parameters (depending on requirements, 
which are very different for land and ocean); (2) in 
time, 5–10 years, taking into account averaged 
intra-annual (seasonal) variations as a very important 
parameter. 
 
The climatic parameters are defined by processes in 
the climatic system which includes ocean, atmosphere, 
land, the Earth’s biota, and which has become more 
evident in the last decades, human civilization as a 
particular sub-system.  Changes on scales greater than 
L
a
 and T
a 
 are going on continually, and the parameter 
distributions cannot repeat because the state of the 
system is subject to continual changes.  However, 
quasi-periodicities are possible when, neglecting 
insignificant changes, it is possible to look at close 
states as repeated and in limited spans of time to deal 
with climate variations.     
  
Our hypothesis is that changes in climate energy 
balance during all times were limited, and a change 
can be looked at as a part of some longer fluctuation. 
Fluctuations in all climatic parameters have very 
wide spectra, and to define CC for specified periods 
of time we should find reference levels, that is, some 
Activities of Working Group Members  Section 3 
72  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
more or less long periods of small changes, at least in 
mean values and dispersions (understanding “small” 
as not essential for our activity), to find 
quasi-stationary states. What are these states and 
what should be the difference between sets of 
climatic parameters to discriminate between states? 
As for transitions between states – how slow or quick 
should they be for us to interpret them as evolution or 
as a regime shift?   
 
There are no exact answers to these questions due to 
the random character of the multi-parameter 
processes involved and their dependence on the 
particular problems that should be resolved. The 
situation becomes much simpler when we deal with 
globally averaged temperature because its changes 
represent changes in heat energy content in the system 
and, to some extent, its possible transformations into 
mechanical energy of the Earth’s atmosphere and 
ocean currents. Long-term cycles of global 
temperature resulting from changes in solar insolation 
can be due to variations in the tilt of the Earth’s 
rotation axis, procession of the equinoxes along the 
Earth’s elliptic orbit, and changes in the eccentricity 
of the orbit.  The relevant periods are from about 
100,000 to thousands of years (Lindzen, 1994). Much 
shorter periods on the spectrum can be attributed to 
higher harmonics of the 24,000- and 19,000-year 
cycles, related to long-term cycles in ocean– 
atmosphere interaction.  Orbital motions lead to not 
only small variations in averaged insolation, but also to 
considerable changes in its geographical distribution. 
No less important are variations and inversions of the 
Earth’s magnetic field (Valet and Courtillot, 1992). 
Their effects on climate can be realized by  
(1) their influence on the upper atmosphere and 
magnetosphere electromagnetic fields and consequent 
changes in the upper baric and velocity fields, and   
(2) their influence on ocean water optical properties 
directly and via living matter. 
 
On the scale from decades to thousands of years, the 
most pronounced climate-related effects can be 
attributed to solar activity.  These effects can be 
realized through many different mechanisms, which 
can be in phase, out of phase or in opposite phases. 
Among the processes being examined by many 
investigators are changes in total solar irradiance 
(solar constant) leading to fluctuations in the amount 
of heat energy reaching the Earth’s surface. In solar 
cycles, that is, on decadal scales, the solar constant 
fluctuations during the last millennium were of order 
0.1%, and no related substantial trends in global 
temperature were observed.  Temperature is directly 
related to energy, but we should understand that (1) its 
globally averaged value is not very useful for CC 
description if it does not exceed some unknown 
critical values; (2) a large part of heat energy is 
converted into kinetic energy of the ocean and 
atmosphere movements and cannot participate in the 
description of CC while the interchange between heat 
and kinetic energy is going on in a wide spectrum of 
time and space scales; (3) energy comes to the Earth 
unevenly, and the main energy of climate fluctuations 
is not in mean values, but in dispersions of thermal 
and dynamic fluctuations, the mean values being only 
residuals of these fluctuations.  Nevertheless, as a 
result of many studies, it was stated in the 
Intergovenmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth 
Assessment Report (IPCC AR4; IPCC 2007) that 
considerable climate change has been going on 
quickly during the last decades.   So the main question 
is: Where is the energy coming from? What are the 
main factors affecting the global energy balance?  
 
If we look at the Earth’s biosphere, it is evident that its 
changes must be related to climate variations, but land 
ecosystems are under the extremely strong influence 
of anthropogenic factors, and separating out the 
effects of climate becomes rather difficult.  The ocean 
ecosystems change on larger time scales, and are 
directly influenced by the natural environment so that 
it is easier to follow their dependence on local climate 
conditions.  Here, interesting facts arise. Fluctuations 
of species and population abundance are an inherent 
property, but in many cases synchronous fluctuations 
of abundance of different species in different parts of 
the ocean are observed, though local climate 
conditions are going on in opposite directions (West 
and East parts of the North Pacific as an example). 
Other striking observations are that changes in 
ecosystem characteristics cannot only be synchronous 
with climate change, or follow them with different 
lags, but can also forestall them.  An example of such 
possibilities is shown in Figure 3.5.1.  Lags of about 
2–3 years in both directions can be seen.  To explain 
such situations, we should look for global factors that 
are not only inside the climate–biota system, but can 
independently influence climate and biota.

Climate Change and the World Ocean – 
Energy Considerations 
 
If we limit ourselves to the analysis of temperature as 
the main climatic parameter, there can be two 
processes leading to CC: (1) change of space–time 
distribution of temperature over the Globe without 
change in dispersion, that is, of full energy of 
fluctuations; (2) change in dispersions that means 
change in energy space–time distribution.  Evidently, 
we now have the second case.  
 
The energy sources can be internal and external to the 
Earth.  The only important external energy factor is 
solar radiation, and it has not changed considerably 
during the last decades.  To explain observed trends of 
global temperature, the main attention in most studies 
has been given to greenhouse gases, which are not 
sources of energy but can be treated as internal factors, 
changing the balance between incoming and outgoing 
radiation.  We do not discuss here all findings about 
the relevant processes, but draw attention to the other 
aspect of the problem.  If we assume that total solar 
radiation does not change substantially (at least, it 
cannot fully explain the observed trends in global 
temperature), and effects of solar activity on the 
atmosphere do not produce long trends in climate 
(these effects are fluctuating with short periods and 
are graded down by averaging), we should look for 
the answer in the Earth’s surface properties to 
assimilate, accumulate, and discharge solar energy 
into the atmosphere.  
  
There are only two systems on the Earth effectively 
accumulating solar energy for the long run: (1) plants 
on land and in the ocean and (2) the ocean itself. 
Terrestrial ecosystems can produce biomass 
comparable to that in the ocean, but there is no 
accumulating system that could, in the long run, 
discharge and convert the immense amount of this 
energy into mechanical energy of the atmosphere and 
ocean.  Assimilation of solar energy on land has 
changed drastically during the last centuries. 
Deforestation and urbanization on all the continents 
have led to large parts of land, instead of assimilating 
and converting solar energy into organic green matter 
(coal deposits are due to such processes), are 
transformed into large areas, extremely heated in 
daytime and emitting extreme energy at night.  This 
leads to a rise in local energy gradients in space and 
time (particularly land–ocean heat content 
differences) but at present, retention of heat on land is 
not considerable. 
  
In the ocean, which occupies 72% of the Earth’s 
surface, processes of effective assimilation and 
accumulation of solar energy in plants 
(phytoplankton), and in the water itself, are 
effectively going on, and they generally tend to go in 
opposite directions: the more solar energy is 
assimilated by phytoplankton (PP), the less energy is 
accumulated in water layers.  Light is absorbed with 
the help of chlorophyll pigments in photosynthesis 
and scattered by plants so that it can penetrate to a 
depth of about 150 m in clear water with low 
concentrations of PP (the lower limit of the photic 
layer in oligotrophic waters) and only to 15–20 m in 
mid-latitude waters with high concentrations of PP.  
In both cases, the depth of solar energy penetration is 
not limited by only optical properties of water.  Due to 
multi-scale vertical and horizontal mixing and deep 
ocean circulation, it can be accumulated at all depths 
and in all parts of the ocean, but in general, the 
interrelationship between PP and photic layer depth is 
realized.  Part of the solar energy absorbed by plants is 
scattered back into the atmosphere, and high 
concentrations of PP in a thin layer will augment back 
radiation and influence the total energy balance.  
  
Several quantitative estimates, compiled in Lappo et 
al. (1990), can illustrate the comparative significance 
of thermal processes in the ocean.  Total solar energy

These estimates may be supplemented by the results 
from the IPCC AR4 Synthesis Report, Working 
Group 1, Chapter 5 (IPCC, 2007).  The ocean heat 
content change for the period from 1961–2003 was 
14.2 × 10
22
 J from a total of 15.9 × 10
22
 J.  It was about 
30 times more than in the atmosphere and about 20 
times more than on the continent.  If we take into 
account that the heat to continents is transported by 
atmosphere currents from the ocean, the decisive role 
of the ocean in climate formation becomes obvious. 
The highest rate of ocean heating was in the periods 
1965–1980 and 1985–2005, and the main contribution 
in heat content gives the upper layer 0–700 m.  The 
largest warming occurred in the sub-antarctic region, 
which is known to have maximum plankton 
concentration.  
 
Section 3 Activities of Working Group Members  
PICES Scientific Report No. 40  75 
Two important facts should be emphasized in these 
estimates: (1) Energies of fuel combustion, 
consumption and photosynthesis are close, and we 
know that photosynthesis supplies oxygen, which is 
consumed by fuel combustion.  The oxygen balance 
shift for the benefit of combustion is very undesirable. 
On the other hand, if the part of the energy for 
photosynthesis increases, the part for atmosphere 
dynamics becomes smaller.  (2) We see that energy of 
thermal processes is an order higher than energy of 
dynamic processes in the ocean and two orders higher 
than energy of atmosphere circulation.  This means 
that even relatively small changes in ocean thermal 
energy will lead to considerable changes in the 
atmospheric state, which defines for us the most 
visible and important properties of climate.  
 
The explanation of global warming by greenhouse 
effects, caused mainly by elevated CO
2
 
concentrations, implies that additional heat is supplied 
to the ocean by backscatter from the atmosphere, but 
having the estimated ocean/atmosphere ratio of 
energy content changes 30/1, we believe that 
greenhouse gases, even taking into account the rising 
greenhouse role of water vapor in the warmed ocean, 
are insufficient to explain the reported warming.  It 
becomes evident that the main source of energy for 
CC is the World Ocean as the main energy 
accumulating system.  To obtain a more exact view of 
the CC extent and its space–time properties, we need 
information about two processes: (1) mechanisms of 
changes in the ocean’s accumulating properties and  
(2) accumulated energy discharge that includes 
energy redistribution in the ocean and its contribution 
to ocean–atmosphere interaction. 
 
 
Climate Change, Sun and Life in the Ocean 
 
Solar radiation is the main source of energy on the 
Earth and the relationship of CC with solar activity 
has been investigated for more than two centuries. 
However, “despite the increasing evidence of its 
importance, solar-climate variability is likely to 
remain controversial until a physical mechanism is 
established” (Kirkby, 2008).  It is natural to obtain 
controversial results because (1) there is no single 
mechanism, but many different mechanisms, 
corresponding to different kinds of solar emanation – 
magnetic, electromagnetic, corpuscular, etc.; (2) in 
most studies, relationships were looked for in the 
form of statistical correlations which can well 
describe linear interrelations, but do not give reliable 
results for nonlinear processes which prevail in 
sun–climate interactions.  The well studied pathway 
for solar and cosmic ray effects is through changes in 
atmosphere properties (ion-aerosol-cloud processes) 
with consequent changes in solar energy reaching the 
Earth’s surface (non-uniform over the Globe) and 
direct influence on motions in the upper atmosphere. 
The climatic significance of these processes was 
analyzed by Kirkby (2008).   Based on the estimates 
given in the previous section, we believe that changes 
in the assimilating capacity of the ocean as the main 
accumulator of solar energy are not less, and in long 
run, more important than changes in the atmosphere 
properties.  The question is – What are the main 
factors affecting the energy absorbing capacities of 
the ocean?  To answer this question we have to look 
more attentively into sun–climate–life interrelations.   
  
We saw that primary production by PP takes up a 
considerable part of solar energy (from 10 to 70%) 
penetrating the ocean waters.  At the same time, the 
depth of solar energy penetration depends on the 
optical properties of water, and these properties are 
determined by PP concentration.  If there is some 
factor affecting PP concentration, it will inevitably 
change (1) the amount of solar radiation in the layer 
(the deeper the layer, the more radiation); (2) the 
amount of solar energy consumed by PP for new 
production.  Because the influence of solar radiation 
on living matter has been studied for a long time and 
is not in doubt, we believe that it is the main factor 
affecting PP communities in the ocean.  Though PP is 
sensitive to water temperature, the globally averaged 
change in temperature is too small to globally 
influence PP biomass.   We believe that water and PP 
properties can change and have considerable 
anomalies not only due to internal processes, but also 
due to considerable changes in solar activity, which is 
generally related with sun spots represented by Wolf 
numbers (Wn).  Figure 3.5.2 shows fluctuations of 
Wn monthly values from 1750– 2010.   The spectrum 
of solar activity, if described by the spectrum of Wn, 
is very large – from several days (3–4, 7, 14, 27 days; 
3, 4 months) through quasi-biennial to 11 and 22 years 
and further to 29, 38 and 85–87 years (Figs. 3.5.3 and 
3.5.4).  Figure 3.5.5 shows the statistical (averaged) 
spectrum of Wn for the period 1750–2010. The 
short-period part from 1 year to 2 months is especially 
highlighted in the insert to show very sharp peaks at 3, 
4, and 5 months.  Key scales of PP blooming and 
zooplankton feeding are measured in weeks, and the 
short anomalies in any forcing factors (see also the 
27-day peak in Figure 3.5.4)  have a greater 
probability to fall in resonance with natural biological 
periods, and so lead to considerable interaction 
between physical and biological processes.

In Figure 3.5.2 we can see that the amplitudes and 
frequencies of Wn are modulated, and the change of 
spectral structure with time may be important.  The 
Hilbert-Huang (HH) spectrum (Huang et al., 1998), 
describing the time–frequency–energy (or time– 
period–energy) distribution of Wn, is shown in  
Figure 3.5.6.  The strip of maxima, corresponding to 
the 11-year cycle, is not uniform – there are times of 
high and low energy of Wn fluctuations, that is, there 
are considerable changes in solar activity on time 
scales of several decades (29, 38 and 87 years on our 
spectra are examples).  On the other hand, it becomes 
obvious from the HH spectrum that short-period 
maxima are not self-contained, but grow out of the 
11-year cycle to the shortest 2- to 3-month peaks. 
Activities of Working Group Members  Section 3 
78  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
The main cycles, thoroughly examined by many 
investigators, are 11 and 22 years. The largest 
amplitudes of energy response to the sun-induced 
fluctuations are in tropical regions of the oceans and in 
mid-latitudes and sub-polar regions (Tourre and White, 
1995).  In the tropics there is a maximum of available 
solar irradiance and a minimum of albedo. In 
mid-latitudes and sub-polar regions there are maxima 
of ocean–atmosphere interactions (especially in the 
western parts of the oceans) and high plankton 
concentrations.  So we can anticipate that the onset of 
heat content anomalies in mid-latitudes is due mainly 
to changes in PP concentration, and in tropical regions 
to wind and currents fluctuations.  The low velocity of 
equatorial currents will lead to higher heat 
accumulation and vice versa. If heat content anomalies 
in large areas arise, two mechanisms are switched on 
to spread them over the Globe:  a quick way by 
atmospheric motions and a long way by ocean 
currents.  Obviously, anomalies transported by the 
atmosphere are short-lived, but properly averaged, 
they can interfere, or be in resonance with, long-term 
ocean transport, which has many spatial and temporal 
scales. A very important property of ocean– 
atmosphere interactions, hampering their modeling, 
should be emphasized: short-term (high frequency) 
anomalies in the atmosphere can lead to long-term 
(low frequency) consequences in the ocean and vice 
versa – long-term anomalies in the ocean can lead to 
short-term consequences in the atmosphere.  
 
The most convincing results concerning relationships 
between the thermal state of the ocean and solar 
activity were reported by Tourre and White (1995) 
and White et al. (1998).   They showed that decadal 
and interdecadal variability of depth-weighted 
vertical average temperature (from the sea surface to 
the top of the main pycnocline) are in phase across the 
Indian, Pacific, Atlantic, and global oceans, each 
significantly correlated with changing surface solar 
radiative forcing.  They believe that the sum of solar 
radiative forcing and greenhouse effects can explain 
the sharp increase in global- and basin-averaged 
temperatures, but the proposed mechanism seems to 
be incomplete.  First, the global average sea surface 
temperature response to changing solar radiative 
forcing is almost twice that expected from radiation 
balance.  Second, the trend during the analyzed period 
has no explanation in the framework of the 
mechanism proposed, and was eliminated by means 
of filtration. Third, the depth-weighted vertical 
average temperature changes in the Indian, Pacific, 
Atlantic, and global oceans are correlated with 
changing surface radiative forcing at a lag of 0 ± 2 
years.  If we are looking for a cause and effect 
relationship, the negative lag at –2 years needs 
additional explanation beyond simple forcing by the 
change in surface solar radiation.  The interesting 
results of Tourre and White (1995) show that 
anomalies of surface temperature and heat content in 
layers 0–400 m are opposite in phase (Figures 3.5.7 
and 3.5.8).  
 
Thereupon, we draw attention to interrelationships 
between the three systems: climate, solar radiation 
and ocean ecosystems. It is known that almost all 
climate-changing external (of solar and cosmic 
origin) and internal processes are accompanied by 
variations in electromagnetic (EM) and magnetic 
fields. Among the sun-attributed processes are 
integral radiation, flares, corpuscular flows, magnetic 
fields, and frequency spectrum fluctuations 
(especially in the high-frequency range). The 
biological effectiveness of EM fields is dependent on 
the wave length, and it is especially high in the range 
of ultraviolet (UV) irradiance (Aguilera et al., 1999). 
Relative fluctuations of this irradiance caused by 
different solar events can be an order higher than 
relative fluctuations of total solar radiation.  Among 
different periods, characteristic for solar activity, UV 
has a quasi-biennial periodicity, reaching a maximum 
in years of the east phase and minimum in years of the 
west phase of El Niño Southern Oscillation 
(Troshichev and Gabis, 1998).  The main effect of UV 
in the ocean is photo-inhibition, when considerable 
reduction in the photosynthetic capacity of a plant 
takes place.  Different species of PP have different 
abilities to withstand UV-induced damage (the 
dinoflagellate Noctiluca, and Fuchus distichus as 
examples), and corresponding changes cannot only 
occur in the PP biomass, but also in the structure of 
plankton communities.  Less damaged species have 
preferences among competitive species and produce 
exceptionally high biomasses, changing the water 
transparency.  In that case, “red tides” might not be so 
much a result as the cause of El Niño. 
 
Besides the light range 400–700 nm, responsible for 
photosynthesis, the biological effectiveness of EM 
fields is especially high in the extremely low 
frequency range 10
11
–10
12
 Hz.  A very high internal 
field in bio-membranes (100,000 V cm
–1
) leads to a 
strong polar character in biological objects; 
oscillations in parts of the membrane become connected 
with electric vibrations. It has been shown that 
nonlinear coupling of elastic and electric polar modes 
and additional energy supply can create a quasi- 
ferroelectric behavior in cells that can explain 
extraordinarily high sensitivity of biological systems 
to extremely weak electromagnetic signals (Kaiser, 
Section 3 Activities of Working Group Members  
PICES Scientific Report No. 40  79 
1982; Achimovicz, 1982).  Coherent oscillations will 
lead to collective biochemical reactions through 
non-linear long-range interactions. Actually, we have 
here the non-thermal bioeffects of electromagnetic 
radiation: processes with energy much lower than 
needed for metabolism begin the trigger of 
macroscopic processes in living systems.  The same is 
true for fluctuations in magnetic fields (some PP 
species can move along magnetic lines of the Earth). 
Such processes are treated as informational, and we 
can say that information, received by biological 
systems, controls their energy and mass interactions 
with environment.  In this way, solar and galactic 
cosmic ray fluctuations can affect the enzymatic 
activity, metabolism and productivity of living matter 
on the Earth. 
These effects can work at any trophic level, especially 
for the living matter continually exposed to radiation, 
that is, for PP. If an anomaly is forced at that level, the 
time of bottom-up changes will depend on the length 
of the trophic chain for the specific species, and it can 
be shorter than the time needed in the tropics or in 
other regions of originating anomalies to reach the 
area of high ocean–atmosphere energy exchange.  On 
the other hand, synchronous externally-driven global 
changes can arise in populations of higher level 
consumers, and in this case we will observe top-down 
effects of ecosystem changes practically without, or 
with very short lags, relative to irradiative forcing.

Living matter is the only system on the Earth that can 
filter out thermal noise in specific frequency ranges 
and in this way, react to non-thermal impacts (that is, 
with energy lower than the thermal motion of 
molecules), which we treat as information flow. Some 
kinds of information also have lyotropic solutions 
because they can change their structure without 
changing chemical composition and thermodynamic 
state.  Biological liquids are just lyotropic solutions 
with high sensitivity to extra weak fluctuations of the 
EM and magnetic fields, and they can be an additional 
means of having non-climate effects on living matter 
and a subsequent impact on living matter in the ocean 
on GC.  We suggest that the whole World Ocean is to 
some extent a lyotropic liquid, and corresponding 
investigations would be useful.  
 
Another mechanism of the EM-field fluctuation can 
be related to the fact that many marine organisms 
have specific EM and magnetic field perception. It is 
possible that just lyotropic biological liquids are 
responsible for such perception in the cases when no 
specific organisms can be found. Externally and 
internally forced large-scale fluctuations of EM and 
magnetic fields will change corresponding population 
behavior and ecosystem characteristics with the 
previously discussed consequences for climate.  A 
generalized scheme of interactions in the Earth’s 
climatic system, including mankind, is proposed in 
Figure 3.5.9. 
 
We do not consider here actual anthropogenic 
impacts: they affect nature very unnaturally and are 
the objective of many investigations.  However, it is 
clear that almost all kinds of human activity lead to 
additional input of radiation, pollution, chemical 
contamination, and to the degradation of the most 
necessary parts of nature – green living matter,

oxygen, and clear water. Our simple integrated 
scheme of the processes discussed in this paper shows 
that not only do all natural systems interact with each 
other in both directions, but all of them are influenced 
by human activity (as a rule, in a harmful direction). 
The only object in the scheme directly affecting 
everything, and not having any feedback from human 
activity is the Sun, but who knows? 
 
 
Conclusions 
 
• The World Ocean is the most important 
component of the Earth climatic system and the 
main contributor of energy for climate change.  Its 
leading role in that system is due to its ability to 
accumulate solar energy and discharge it into the 
atmosphere with a very complicated space–time– 
amplitude distribution. 
• Accumulating and discharging properties of the 
ocean are not constant.  They fluctuate and change 
in time and space depending not only on the 
internal dynamics and state of the atmosphere and 
ocean–atmosphere interaction, but also on the state 
of living matter in the ocean. Living matter 
properties, in turn, are exposed to external sources 
for the ocean processes – mainly of solar, 
geophysical, and anthropogenic origin. 
• As a result, to show the active role and significance 
of living matter in climate–ecosystem interactions, 
we should carry out investigations along both 
directions: sun–climate–ecosystems feedbacks and 
sun–ecosystems–climate feedbacks.  It could be a 
closed circle, but is, in fact, unclosed by external 
forces which have very different effects (in time 
and space, in amplitudes and quality) on climate 
and ecosystems.

• Estimations of energy flow (see section on 
“Climate change and the World Ocean – Energy 
considerations”) show that it is very important and 
pressing to also investigate along the directions of 
human activity–climate–ecosystems feedbacks 
and human activity–ecosystems–climate feedbacks. 
• Living matter can receive and react to signals with 
extremely low energy – informational flows – and 
in this way can control high-energy macroscopic 
processes. So future investigations should 
integrate detailed studies in different areas.  
• The actual state of the Earth’s climate is 
characterized by the World Ocean overheating and 
continents overcooling, leading to exceptionally 
high evaporation, atmosphere circulation, and 
extreme spatial–temporal dispersions of all 
climatic parameters. 
• The increase of green living matter on continents 
and in the ocean could diminish land–ocean 
contrasts, global ocean energy content, and lead to 
a moderate global climate.

3.6 Evaluation of climatic variability in the Far-Eastern Seas using regional 
data sets and the relationship with large-scale climate processes

Introduction  
 
Recent Russian studies (Kattsov et al., 2007; 
Meleshko et al., 2007, 2008; Govorkova et al., 2008; 
Assessment Report, 2008; Gruza and Ran’kova, 
2009) show the difficulty in realistically simulating 
regional features of climate in the Far East of Russia 
by atmosphere–ocean circulation models (AOGCMs) 
presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change 4th Assessment Report (IPCC, 2007).  The 
ensemble of AOGCMs successfully reproduces the 
seasonal cycle of air temperature, location and 
intensity of the Siberian High and Aleutian Low, and 
all the main climatic parameters, at least averaged 
over vast areas.  However, the modeled trends of 
climatic parameters for the region do not coincide 
with the observational trends.  Model ensembles show 
that the trends of air temperature are positive over the 
whole Far East region in all seasons, with maximal 
inclination in its northern part in winter.  In contrast, 
observed trends of winter warming are strongest in the 
southern part of the region, but weak negative trends 
are observed over North-East Asia in winter, and 
strong positive trends in this area are observed in 
spring and autumn. These differences between 
modelled and observed climate changes are obviously 
caused by processes of regional scale and should be 
analyzed by regional models of high resolution. 
However, Russia still has no reliable high resolution 
model designed for the Far East and the Far-Eastern 
Seas.  Essentially it is connected with a “fatal lack” of 
regular observations, and also with very complex 
physics of climatic processes on the ocean–continent 
boundary between North-East Asia and the North 
Pacific. Therefore, in preparing this report on climatic 
variability, we have given more attention to long-term 
sets of observed parameters that allow us to evaluate 
low-frequency variability in the Far-Eastern Seas. 
Possibilities of climate projections used to project 
marine ecosystem changes are considered as well, 
using the example of the Japan/East Sea. 
Data and Methods  
 
A set of parameters for climate change evaluation was 
chosen taking into account duration, uniformity and 
regularity of observations and significance for marine 
ecosystem research. The following sources were used:  
• Time series of ice cover in the Okhotsk Sea in 
March (annual maximum) for 1929–1956 
collected by Kryndin (1964) from various 
observations (shipboard, aircraft, coastal);  
• Regular 10-day aircraft observations conducted by 
the Russian Hydrometeorological Service in the  
Okhotsk Sea in 1957–1991 and in the Bering Sea 
in 1960–1991;  
• Satellite charts of ice cover obtained from the 
Far-Eastern Regional Center, Khabarovsk for 
1992–1998 and from National Ice Center, U.S.A 
(http://www.natice.noaa.gov/pub/west_arctic) since 
1998; 
• Ice charts of the Okhotsk Sea distributed by the 
Japanese Meteorological Agency (for 2001– 
2010);  
• Monthly mean air and water temperature data at 
coastal meteorological stations (Fig. 3.6.1) 
published by the Russian Hydrometeorological 
Service;  
• Monthly mean air temperature data at 
meteorological stations collected in NASA GISS 
(http://www.giss.nasa.gov/data/update/gistemp).  
• Sea surface temperature (SST) data from the Real 
Time Data Base of NEAR-GOOS (http://goos. 
kishou.go.jp/rrtdb) from 1950 to the latest month; 
• Air temperature and sea level pressure data of the 
National Centers for Environmental Prediction 
(NCEP) reanalysis (http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cdc/ 
data.ncep.reanalysis).

sea surface temperature (SST) are numbered 1–6. 
 
 
The longest time series are for the data on ice cover, 
and air and water temperature at meteorological 
stations. Sea ice extent was measured as the 
percentage of the ice-covered area from the total area 
of the Bering and Okhotsk seas and the Tatar Strait. 
These data were collected by 10-day periods, and 
mean winter ice cover was calculated by averaging for 
the period from January to April.  For some purposes, 
the SST data were averaged within certain areas 
located in the Bering Sea (2 areas), Okhotsk Sea  
3 areas), and Japan/East Sea (1 area) (Fig. 3.6.1). 
 
Large-scale climatic indices (Aleutian Low Pressure 
Index (ALPI), North Pacific Index (NPI), Siberian 
High Index (SHI), Atmospheric Forcing Index (AFI), 
Pacific Circulation Index (PCI), West Pacific (WP), 
El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Arctic 
Oscillation (AO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) 
and Victoria indices, global and Northern Hemisphere 
averaged surface air temperature; macro-scale 
pressure gradient between the Siberian High and 
Aleutian Low) were used from the following sources: 
• Monthly mean global and Northern Hemisphere 
air temperature anomalies data from http://www. 
cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/ (Brohan et al., 
2006). 
• Climatic indices from:

• Macro-scale pressure gradient between the 
Siberian High and Aleutian Low and intensity of 
the Far-Eastern centers of atmospheric action (by 
Vasilevskaya et al., 2003). 
The indices were used in many studies devoted to 
climatic variability (e.g., Mantua et al., 1997; 
Thompson and Wallace, 1998; Wolter and Timlin, 
1998; Bond and Harrison, 2000; Miller and Schneider, 
2000; Schneider et al., 2002). In addition, data on the 
frequency of regional atmospheric circulation types 
determined by Glebova (1999) were used.  This 
classification of regional circulation is based on the 
mutual arrangement of high and low atmospheric 
pressure centers and prevailing winds. 
 
All data were analyzed by standard statistical methods. 
For each parameter, annual values were normalized 
by subtracting the average of all years and dividing by 
the standard deviation. Measures of climate 
variability and covariability (variances, covariances,

correlations, coherency, standard deviations, 
anomalies, spectra, extremes, etc.) were estimated 
with a statistical significance level ≥ 95 %.  
 
 
Evaluation of Low-Frequency Variability of 
the Thermal Regime in the Far-Eastern Seas 
 
Consistent estimations of regional climatic trends in 
air temperature have been made by many 
investigators (Kim еt al., 1997; Varlamov еt al., 1998; 
Pestereva and Pushkina 1998; Ponomarev еt al., 2000, 
2002, 2005, 2007; Assessment Report, 2008) from 
observations collected by Russian meteorological 
stations. Principal features of these trends are: 
• strong irregularity and inhomogeneity in time and 
space connected with specific macro-circulating 
atmospheric processes on the boundary between 
the Eurasian continent and the Pacific Ocean; 
• maximal trends to warming in winter and spring in 
the southern part of the region (Primorye, Japan, 
southern Kamchatka) and in spring, summer and 
autumn over Chukotka;  
• weak negative trends in the areas to the north from 
the Okhotsk Sea and to the west from the Bering 
Sea in winter;  
• tendency to decreasing differences between 
summer and winter air temperatures in the 
Japan/East Sea and increases in the northwestern 
Okhotsk Sea; i.e., the continentality increases in 
the northern part of Far East and decreases in its 
southern part. 
 
Sea ice cover in the Okhotsk Sea shows a negative 
trend both for mean winter values (for 1957–2010;  
p = 99.9 %; Fig. 3.6.2) and annual maximums 
(1929–2010; p = 95 %; Fig. 3.6.3), but in the Bering 
Sea and the Tatar Strait, its negative trends are not 
statistically significant.  The time of annual maximum 
has no significant trends in the Okhotsk and Bering 
seas; generally, it is stable in the Okhotsk Sea and 
highly variable in the Bering Sea (Fig. 3.6.2, right). 
Correlations between annual maximum ice cover and 
its date are not significant, although usually the earlier 
the maximum in the Bering Sea, the lower the ice 
amount.  
 
Ice cover fluctuations show a remarkable feature: 
their phases are opposite between the Okhotsk and 
Bering seas (Yakunin, 1966; Khen, 1997; Plotnikov, 
1997, 2002).  However, after a long period of 
anti-phase variability, the ice cover in these seas 
began to fluctuate synchronously starting in the late 
1980s (Fig. 3.6.4).  Recently, ice extent has been 
decreasing in the Okhotsk and Japan/East seas: the 
last severe winter in these areas was in 2000–2001, 
and the ice extent has been low during the last 6 years, 
with an absolute minimum of mean winter ice cover 
in 2009 (38%) in the Okhotsk Sea.  Recent changes in 
ice cover in the Bering Sea have a positive tendency, 
and its year-to-year variations are opposite to that of 
the Okhotsk Sea, again, with a high ice cover 
percentage in 2009 (36.5 %).  The frequency of 
extreme situations has increased during the last 15 
years in the Okhotsk Sea. 
 
Spectral analysis of the longest time series for 
maximum ice cover in the Okhotsk Sea shows that a 
quasi-pentadecadal oscillation makes a basic 
contribution to the variance (Fig. 3.6.3, right).  This 
oscillation is known as well for air temperature at 
some Far-Eastern meteorological stations 
(Ponomarev et al., 2003; Ustinova and Shevchenko, 
2004), for winter–spring sea level pressure over the 
North Pacific (Minobe, 2000), and for globally 
averaged air temperature (Klyashtorin and Lyubushin, 
2003).  Other important contributions are oscillations 
with periods of 10, 18, and 25 years.  For the updated 
time series with recent years, the contribution of the 
quasi-pentadecadal and 25-year components has 
decreased relatively, but the contribution of the 
10-year scale has increased.  The shorter powerful 
oscillation in the Okhotsk Sea has a period of 7 years, 
noted by Plotnikov (1997, 2002).  In the Tatar Strait, 
shorter cycles have prevailed, but on the whole, the 
periodical components are represented weakly.  The 
spectrum for the Bering Sea has strong oscillations 
with periods of 4–5 and 10 years.  In general, the 
contribution of low-frequency components is the 
highest (74 %) for the Okhotsk Sea and the lowest 
(30 %) for the Tatar Strait.  The physical mechanisms 
of these oscillations are not quite clear yet. 
 
SST variability at coastal meteorological stations is 
determined partially by air conditions but depends on 
local oceanographic processes as well.  That is why it 
is characterized by a small radius of spatial correlation 
after removing trends (Ustinova et al., 2001).  Even 
long-term trends can be opposite at closely spaced 
coastal stations, e.g., in Peter the Great Bay (Gayko, 
2007) because of the effects of local currents and 
upwelling.  However, in general, trends to warming 
are clearly expressed in winter and spring at many 
stations in all the Far-Eastern Seas. (Note that the SST 
variability in winter is small at the meteorological 
stations in the Okhotsk and Bering seas, covered by 
sea ice, so it cannot serve as an indicator of climatic 
changes; moreover, some stations stop SST 
observations in winter).  Besides, positive trends of 
spring SST have been found in areas 3–6 (Fig. 3.6.1) 
Activities of Working Group Members  Section 3 
86  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
of the Okhotsk and Japan/East seas. In contrast, SST 
trends to cooling prevailed in the Okhotsk and 
Japan/East seas and northwestern Pacific in summer 
until the end of 20th century (Ponomarev et al., 2005). 
The tendency to summer cooling has finished recently 
in the Okhotsk and Bering seas (Khen and Sorokin, 
2008). 
  
Spectra of air and water temperature obtained from 
meteorological station data show a significant 
contribution of high-frequency oscillations (quasi- 
biannual and ENSO scales) while the major part of 
variance of ice cover is formed by low-frequency 
oscillations with periods about a decade and more  
(Fig. 3.6.2, right).  This means that the sea ice is a 
“natural filter” of high-frequency variability.

Fig. 3.6.4 Eleven-year “running correlation” of the mean winter ice extents in the Okhotsk Sea and Bering Sea. 
 
 
SST anomalies in the warming season (March–June) 
show a remarkable spatial coordination with mean 
winter ice cover in the Okhotsk and Bering seas  
(Fig. 3.6.5).  There is a negative correlation between 
SST anomalies and ice cover in the Bering Sea over a 
large area from Kamchatka to the North American 
coast, along this coast and in the tropical zone, but the 
correlation is positive in the Kuroshio, eastward from 
the Kuril Islands and in the central North Pacific. 
These “U-shape” patterns are almost stable from 
March to June. The picture is similar but less clear for 
ice cover in the Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 3.6.5).  
 
 
The Relationship of Regional Variability with 
Large-scale Climate Processes 
 
All large-scale changes of the thermal regime in the 
Far-Eastern Seas are connected somehow with the 
global and hemispheric processes in the atmosphere 
and ocean.  However, regional processes modify the 
global impact considerably.  The linkages between 
large-scale climatic processes and regional conditions 
in the Far-Eastern Seas are different for various 
temporal and spatial scales.  For example, ice cover 
variations in the Okhotsk and Bering seas correlate 
well with variations of winter air temperature 
anomalies in the northern hemisphere for the time 
scale >7 years (R = –0.71 and –0.48, respectively) 
because of similar trends and quasi-pentadecadal 
contributions (see Fig. 3.6.6, left), but the correlation 
becomes insignificant after filtration of these 
long-term components.  Ice cover and SST in the 
Far-Eastern Seas have no strong correlation with the 
majority of climatic indices, with only a small 
exception (Khen et al., 2008).  Our results for linkages 
of ice cover in the Bering Sea and NPI and WP index 
are similar to the results of Niebauer et al. (1999).  
The WP index characterizes a north–south dipole over 
the western North Pacific and influences the ice cover 
Activities of Working Group Members  Section 3 
88  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
in the Okhotsk Sea more than in the Bering Sea. 
Indices connected with parameters of the Aleutian 
Low and PDO are more important for the Bering Sea 
then for the Okhotsk Sea.  The Victoria SST pattern is 
more representative for ice cover in the Okhotsk Sea 
than the PDO, R = 0.54 (0.62 after filtering 
quasi-2-year oscillations).  For the Bering Sea the 
correlation is less, R = 0.31 and 0.36, accordingly. 
Since 1993 this index has changed synchronously 
with ice cover both in the Okhotsk Sea and in Bering 
Sea (Fig. 3.6.6, right).  Before this period, a contrast 
prevailed in oscillation phases of the ice cover in the 
Bering Sea and Victoria index.  The AO index and 
macro-scale pressure gradient between the Siberian 
High and Aleutian Low, as a winter monsoon index, 
are important for climatic parameters in the Okhotsk 
and Japan/East seas.

The highest correlation is found between the ice 
extent and SST in the Far-Eastern Seas and the 
frequency of winter types of regional atmospheric 
circulation proposed by Glebova (1999). The 
frequency of types IV (cold) and VI (warm) for the 
Okhotsk Sea corresponds strongly with the mean 
winter ice cover in the Sea, and the correlation is 
positive in the former case and negative in the latter. 
The frequency of some of Glebova’s other types is 
connected with the variability of SST anomalies in 
certain areas.  
 
Stability of the relationships is analyzed by statistical 
methods, with emphasis on cases when the 
connections change from positive to negative and vice 
versa.  “Running correlations” are used to reveal 
significant changes in the relationships (Fig. 3.6.7). 
The steadiest relationships are found between WP 
index and regional SST and ice cover.  Obviously, the 
Far-Eastern troposphere trough reflected by the WP 
index determines regional conditions in many aspects. 
However, the correlation between the winter WP 
index and ice cover in the Okhotsk Sea decreased 
sharply in the early 1980s and after recovering in the 
early 1990s, started to decrease again in 2006.  For the 
period 1976–1987, the correlation between mean 
winter ice cover and the Victoria pattern was 
insignificant. It is known that since 1990, the role of 
the Victoria pattern has increased in comparison with 
the PDO (Bond et al., 2003), and the index changes 
synchronously with ice cover in the Okhotsk Sea. 
Correlation between the multivariate ENSO index and 
ice cover in the Okhotsk Sea tended to decrease after 
the climate shift in 1977.  During the last few years the 
correlation has declined to near zero values. 
Pronounced reorganizations of the relationships with 
accompanied inverse (for example, between ice cover 
in the Okhotsk Sea and AO/PDO, winter SST in the 
Japan/East Sea and AO) correspond to the 
well-known 1976/77 and 1988/89 regime shifts (e.g., 
Hare and Mantua, 2000; Bond et al., 2003; Rodionov 
and Overland, 2005) most often. Similar changes of 
“global–regional linkages” depending on climatic 
regimes were found by Ponomarev et al. (2008, 2010) 
for some regional climatic variables (e.g., 
amplification of the AO effect and weakening of the 
winter ENSO signal in the western subarctic area).  
The longest periods of relatively stable linkages were 
found for winter SST in the subtropical region of the 
Japan/East Sea and ENSO and WP indices (Fig. 3.6.7). 
Analysis of the changes in the relationships within 
regimes (from one regime shift to other) has shown 
that the quasi-steady state of the climatic system can 
be broken locally in the Far-Eastern Seas because of 
moving climatic atmospheric and oceanic fronts, 
trajectories of cyclones, change of blocking processes, 
and other boundary phenomena. 
 
Regional features of climatic variability in the 
Far-Eastern Seas show potential difficulties for 
statistical downscaling in this region mainly due to: 
• insufficient data supply (number of meteorological 
stations in Siberia and the Russian Far East has 
decreased since 1992, and there was a coarseness 
of the observational network in these regions 
initially); 
• local “sub-grid” physical processes; 
• instability of relationships between regional 
parameters and large-scale patterns.  
 
Activities of Working Group Members  Section 3 
90  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
Whereas statistical downscaling assumes that the 
relationship between predictors (large-scale variables) 
and predictions (small-scale variables) does not vary 
under climate change conditions, the relationship 
between regional parameters (such as sea ice coverage, 
air and water temperature) and large-scale climatic 
indices is very unstable.  The method of atmospheric 
circulation typing (e.g., created by Glebova (1999) for 
the Far-Eastern Seas) allows one to decrease some 
limitations in these regression models.  However, this 
method requires the additional task of classification. 
Obviously, further detailed fundamental studies of 
regional climatic systems are necessary to better 
understand the processes of their variability. 
Reasonable development of observational systems in 
the region is also very important.

Possibilities for Using Climate Projections to 
Predict Marine Ecosystems Changes: A Case of 
the Japan/East Sea  
 
In so far as long-term climate projections are a 
relatively new scientific product that still has some 
novelty but is not actually useful, they are still not 
strictly demanded in practice.  Now it is feasible to 
consider mostly the possibilities of adapting these 
projections to marine ecosystems but not scenarios of 
climate change influence.  These possibilities depend 
on the scale of natural processes and so, on the depth 
of the projected downscaling.  Note that the crux of 
downscaling is not a decreasing of the projection scale 
or heightening of its resolution, but on taking into 
consideration the involvement of sub-scale processes. 
That is why projections of different scales operate with 
different sets of processes, and the success of 
forecasting depends strongly on the basic knowledge of 
these processes, both in the climate system and 
ecosystem. 
 
Theoretically, the variability of ecosystems could be 
caused by both external and internal factors, which 
strongly complicates the problem of their projected 
changes.  Fortunately, the long-term changes usually 
look as environmentally forced ones, which allows us 
to consider marine ecosystem changes as a 
cause-and-effect chain: climate changes–their effect 
on ecosystems.  Using this assumption, the procedure 
of applying climate projections to changes of an 
ecosystem includes three steps: 
1. climate changes projection, 
2. downscaling of the climate change projection to 
the scale of ecosystem or its components, 
3. interpretation of the climate changes in terms of 
the ecosystem or its components using the 
relationships between abiotic and biotic parameters 
of the ecosystem.  
In the case of the Japan/East Sea, both “regional” 
steps (downscaling and interpretation) are problematic 
because both physical and biological processes have 
still not been investigated in detail here.  However, 
current knowledge allows us to outline the main 
consequences of climate change for local 
environments and marine biota with, of course, some 
uncertainties depending on scale.  
 
For the Japan/East Sea ecosystem (basin-scale), it is 
reasonable to also consider the processes of larger and 
smaller scales, namely: regional-scale, basin-scale, 
mesoscale, and sub-mesoscale ones because all of 
 
them could have an influence on the ecosystem and its 
parts or components. In the following we discuss what 
the possibilities of climate projection applications are 
for this ecosystem on these scales. 
 
Regional scale 
The main processes on a regional scale (determining 
environmental conditions in the region of North-East 
Asia–Northwest Pacific) are monsoons: winter and 
summer ones.  This level of downscaling is already 
realized in IPCC models as continental projections, 
including the projections of air temperature and 
precipitation, but not wind rates.  On the other hand, 
monsoon winds cannot influence marine ecosystems 
(except for birds) directly – they do it through certain 
mechanisms of air–sea interaction at lesser scales. 
 
Basin scale 
The most important basin-scale processes are those 
which form water masses of the Japan/East Sea: 
advection of subtropical water; convection (deep and 
slope), subduction – the first forms the surface waters, 
the second – the subsurface, deep and bottom waters, 
and the third – the intermediate waters. These 
processes are only partially included in the global 
IPCC models, but could be modeled in existing 
regional models on the basis of regional-scale IPCC 
projections as initial conditions because they are 
determined by air–sea interactions.  Note that winter 
conditions are more important on this scale because 
convection and subduction occur in winter (Fig. 3.6.8). 
Wind stress estimations are necessary for correct 
modeling of all these processes, so poor or absent 
projections of wind could be a source of uncertainties 
in the projections of advection, convection, and 
subduction and therefore, in the projections of water 
mass conditions. 
 
Following the models and observations in the last 
decades, we see that recent winter warming in 
North-East Asia (that is projected for the 21st century, 
as well) causes prominent changes in the intermediate, 
deep, and bottom layers because of convection 
weakening. For the deep and bottom waters, it means 
warming, deoxygenization, and nitrification; for the 
intermediate water – warming, freshening, and 
enrichment by oxygen; and surface waters become 
less productive (Zuenko, 2008).  On the other hand, 
summer warming does not have consequences so far, 
though it contributes to warming of the surface layer.

Fig. 3.6.8 (Top) Changes of the Siberian High Index (SHI, from Panagiotopoulos et al., 2005, with additions) and Winter 
Monsoon Index (MOI, from Tian et al., 2008).  (Bottom) Correlations of surface air temperature in December–February 
with the winter Arctic Oscillation (AO) index (Wu and Wang, 2002).  The Japan/East Sea is the only basin in the Northwest 
Pacific that has a strong positive relationship with the AO index and therefore, negative relationships with SHI and MOI. 
Tendency to a lowering of winter atmospheric pressure over Siberia prevails in the last decades, which causes warmer 
winters over the Japan/East Sea and weaker stress of winter monsoon winds on its surface. 
 
  
Besides productivity, the projected environmental 
changes will directly influence  some components of 
the ecosystem, in particular the reproduction of some 
animals.  One of the most prominent consequences of 
recent warming in Intermediate Water is the increase 
of zooplankton abundance because of an increase in 
large-sized copepod biomass (Fig. 3.6.9). These 
species mature and spawn in the intermediate layer, 
and its warming is obviously favorable for them (note 
that the Intermediate Water of the Japan/East Sea is 
extremely cold, compared with other seas).   
  
The surface layer temperature conditions influence 
the reproduction and distribution of many fish species, 
both directly and through feeding resources.  For 
example, the maturation of winter-spawning fish 
species depends on temperature in winter (the warmer 
the water, the faster the maturing, the earlier the 
spawning), but the timing of the spring phytoplankton 
bloom depends on the temperature in spring (the 
warmer the water, the earlier the blooming). 
Depending on the relative changes in the environment 
in certain seasons, climate change could cause a 
match or mismatch of the larvae hatching with their 
prey bloom.  So the projected winter warming may be 
unfavorable for some species, as happened with 
saffron cod in the 1990s when the period between its 
spawning and plankton bloom was too long. However, 
the tendency to warming is favorable for warm-water 
species which have the ability to expand over the 
whole basin of the Japan/East Sea.

the same area (Rebstock and Kang, 2003; Zuenko et al., 2010). 
 
 
Mesoscale 
Mesoscale processes occur at natural boundaries of 
the sea, e.g., its coasts, shelves, fronts between water 
masses, mixed layers at its surface and bottom. Some 
of these processes can be modeled in existing models 
as initial conditions on the basis of regional-scale 
(monsoons) and basin-scale (advection) projections, 
but others cannot; actually, their predictability is 
conditioned by knowledge of their driving 
mechanisms.  Even for well-studied processes, the 
uncertainty of their predictions is higher in 
comparison with basin-scale ones because predictions 
of the former are based on predictions of the latter 
ones.  The mechanisms of mesoscale processes’ 
influence on components of the marine ecosystem are 
known in some cases and vague in others, so their 
influence on the ecosystem could be projected 
sometimes.  For example, zooplankton composition in 
the coastal zone (in Peter the Great Bay) could be 
projected on the basis of monsoon wind projections 
because the portion of deep-water species in the 
coastal zone depends strongly on monsoon activity: 
some species are transported into the coastal zone 
within the surface layer by on-shore currents driven 
by summer monsoons; others are advected in the 
subsurface layer by an on-shore compensatory current 
of upwelling circulation driven by winter monsoons 
(Fig. 3.6.10).  Obviously, the projected weakening of 
winter monsoons contributes to a separation of the 
coastal zone from the deep-water sea, so its species 
composition in fall–winter will be poorer (at the 
expense of subtropical species), but relatively stable 
summer monsoons will provide a species diversity of 
summer zooplankton in the coastal zone, with some 
decadal and year-to-year changes, as those shown at 
Figure 3.6.10.  
 
Sub-mesoscale 
Principles of sub-mesoscale processes involving 
long-term projections are unclear yet.  Some, having 
small spatial scales, are driven by mechanisms similar 
to mesoscale ones, as propagation of estuarine plumes 
or tidal fronts, so they can be projected in similar 
ways, but most of them (for example: internal waves, 
estuarine filters, fine structures) have a completely 
different nature, in which the relation to climate 
changes is unknown.  Thus, only few sub-mesoscale 
processes are accounted for in local models of climate 
change, and these models have to be verified 
repeatedly for each new area.  Uncertainty of the 
sub-mesoscale processes projections tends to infinity, 
so including these processes into climate projections 
needs to be preceded by detailed studies of them. 
Other detailed studies are necessary for understanding 
the sub-mesoscale processes’ influence on marine 
ecosystems.   
 
In general, the ability to apply climate change 
projections to marine ecosystems depends strongly on 
our knowledge about the mechanisms of the 
environment’s influence on ecosystems at different 
scales, and about the physical process at different 
scales.  Uncertainty of these projections definitely 
grows with the lowering of scale level, and for the 
Japan/East Sea, it becomes unacceptable on the 
sub-mesoscale level (Table 3.6.1). However, a 
projection is possible for the basin scale.  Fortunately,

the projections on this scale are the most claimed in 
practice, in so far as they concern such practically 
important parameters of marine ecosystems as 
biological productivity, food base, and commercial 
resources, whereas the parameters determined by the 
processes of finer scales, regarding mostly the

Background 
 
Though global climate models can represent many 
identifiable features of the climate system, they also 
suffer from significant localized biases.  Climate 
model biases are not uniform over the globe. For 
example, in the ocean, modeled sea surface 
temperature (SST) errors are often largest along the 
continental margins (Fig. 3.7.1).  Many coupled 
climate models generate very large SST biases in the 
coastal upwelling regions of the California Current 
System (CCS), the Humboldt Current system (HCS) 
and the Benguela Current System (BCS), where 
simulated mean SSTs are much warmer than 
observed.  Figure 3.7.1 (top left panel) shows that the 
U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research 
Community Climate System Model 3 (NCAR- 
CCSM3 spectral atmosphere) used in the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4th 
Assessment Report (IPCC-AR4) was no exception, 
with biases in excess of 3°C in all three regions. 
Furthermore, these SST biases have significant 
remote effects on surface and subsurface temperature 
and salinity, and on precipitation and hence 
atmospheric heating and circulation (Collins et al. 
2006).  Large and Danabasoglu (2006) showed, in 
particular, with observed SSTs imposed along the 
BCS coast in an otherwise freely-evolving CCSM3 
simulation, that there are significant improvements in 
precipitation in the western Indian Ocean, over the 
African continent and across the Equatorial Atlantic. 
Imposed SSTs along the HCS coast reduce 
precipitation in the so-called double Intertropical 
Convergence Zone region of the south tropical 
Pacific.  
 
These errors often coincide with regions of 
importance to oceanic ecosystems and nearby human 
populations.  In the IPCC-AR4 Working Group 1 
Assessment Report, where the reliability of the 
models used to make projections of future climate 
change is assessed, Randall et al. (2007) discuss the 
many improvements and strengths of the current 
generation of coupled models of the physical climate 
system, but they also highlight a number of remaining 
significant model errors.  Furthermore, they state “The 
ultimate source of most such errors is that many 
important small-scale processes cannot be 
represented explicitly in models, and so must be 
included in approximate form as they interact with 
larger-scale features.”  Some of the reasons given for 
the deficiencies are limited computer power, data 
availability and scientific understanding.  Conversely, 
regional models have shown significant skill in 
modeling coastal processes (e.g., Curchitser et al., 
2005, Powell et al., 2007, Combes et al., 2009, 
Veneziani et al., 2009a,b). This creates the opportunity, 
and perhaps necessity, to develop multi-scale 
numerical solution schemes that adapt the resolution in 
specific areas of interest, such as the CCS.  
 
Figure 3.7.1 (top right panel) shows that the coastal 
winds in the latest CCSM4 with a 2° resolution (finite 
volume) atmosphere produce even larger SST biases 
than were apparent in CCSM3 (top left panel), despite 
many improvements to the physical model 
components. Improving the coastal winds by 
increasing the atmospheric resolution to 1°, however, 
significantly reduces the coastal SST biases  
(Fig. 3.7.1, bottom).  The implication is that the 
further reductions in the SSTs required to eliminate 
the coastal biases under present day conditions will 
likely also need to come from improvements to the 
ocean physics and the upwelling of cold water in 
particular.  These improvements must be realized 
before the regional biogeochemistry and ecosystem 
models can be expected to behave accurately because 
of the sensitivity to temperature and the critical 
importance of upwelled nutrients for biological 
processes.

One approach to achieve high-resolution climate- 
scale simulations in a given domain is the nesting of a 
high-resolution limited-area grid within a lower 
resolution large-scale numerical domain (Ito et al., 
2010). With a nesting approach, information is 
downscaled from a coarse to a fine resolution region 
through an overlap in the domains. “Simple” 
downscaling using one-way flow of information 
works well when the forcing data are constrained by 
observations, such as in the case when using 
atmospheric reanalysis products (e.g., Kalnay et al., 
1996).  The high-resolution nest can explicitly resolve 
features missing from the large-scale model 
simulation, though it is still constrained through the 
boundaries by the large-scale climate patterns. 
However, when using freely-evolving coupled 
models, such as those used by IPCC to study past and 
future climate, the mean resulting climate is 
unconstrained by observational data.  Therefore, a 
given atmospheric model can be expected to respond 
differently to an alternative (e.g., high-resolution) 
ocean in the coupled system. The challenge is then to 
not only downscale information to the local scales, 
but also to understand how regional variability affects 
the global climate. 
 
In order to address the above issues, we developed a 
new multi-scale ocean as part of the U.S. NCAR- 
CCSM.  The new composite ocean consists of the 
global Parallel Ocean Program (POP) and the 
Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS).  The new 
composite ocean is connected to the rest of the CCSM 
climate model through a modified flux coupler  
(Fig. 3.7.2). 
 
 
Results from the Multi-scale Coupled Model 
 
In order to test and demonstrate the capabilities of the 
multi-scale climate model, we have been carrying out 
a series of simulations where the Northeast Pacific 
upwelling region is solved using a high-resolution 
(10 km) ocean within a global (1°) model. The 
atmosphere is on a spectral grid (~2°), sea ice is 
solved on the ocean grid and the land surface model 
on the atmospheric grid. The CCSM is initialized 
from a spun-up climatology and time-stepped for 150 
years.  This simulation is then compared to a control 
run without the high-resolution ocean. Figure 3.7.3 is 
a close-up look at the Northeast Pacific showing the 
anomaly in the SST in a coupled climate simulation

 between a case with the composite ocean and the 
control, for all the available months of August 
(upwelling season).  Superimposed are wind vector 
anomalies. What is seen is that the new multi-scale 
ocean is able to resolve the upwelling that is mostly 
missing from the global simulations, and this has a 
significant effect on the regional wind patterns. 
 
 
Fig. 3.7.2 Schematic of the multi-scale CCSM. The original ocean module (POP) has been replaced by a composite 
POP/ROMS module that is controlled by a newly designed ocean driver.  The ocean driver passes fluxes and state variables 
to the respective oceans, controls the communications between the global and regional oceans (boundary conditions) and 
also assembles the output of the two oceans (e.g., SSTs) that are passed to the coupler for the computation of the fluxes to the 
atmosphere (CAM), land (LND/CLM) and sea ice (CICE/CSIM) modules.

The temperature anomaly plot shows the local cooling

Northeast Pacific and also remote effects in the 
Atlantic Ocean.  Significant and robust effects are also 
seen in other variables such as tropical precipitation 
and sea level pressure. 
 
 
Summary 
 
A new multi-scale capability was developed by 
merging a global and a regional ocean model within a 
global climate model.  The goal was to address some 
of the biases exhibited by low-resolution global 
models in regions with implications to marine 
ecosystems. Long integrations show that this 
configuration is able to address some of these regional 
biases.  Furthermore, by preserving the feedbacks 
between the regional and global climate models, we 
are able to study upscaling effects that arise from the 
regionally introduced perturbations.  In the case 
presented here, we see the effect as far afield as the 
North Atlantic Ocean.  Further studies are in progress 
to study the effects of resolving other major upwelling 
regions, as well a new study in a western boundary 
current region where global models also show SST 
biases. Future plans include adding a biogeochemistry 
model to this configuration in order to study the role 
of upwelling regions in global CO
2
 cycles.

Modes of North Pacific and Tropical Pacific 
Coupled Climate Variability 
 
Interannual and decadal-scale variability of the North 
Pacific Ocean and the overlying atmosphere 
significantly impact the weather and climate of North 
America and Eurasia and drive important state 
transitions observed in marine ecosystems across the 
Pacific Ocean (see a recent review by Alexander 
(2010) and references therein).  The Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation (PDO) (e.g., Mantua et al., 1997) emerges 
as the leading mode of North Pacific sea surface 
temperature (SST) anomalies (SSTa).  The PDO to 
first order is the forced response of the North Pacific 
ocean surface to variability in the Aleutian Low (AL), 
the leading mode of North Pacific sea level pressure 
(SLP) anomalies (SLPa).  Temporal modulations in 
the PDO are linked to several important biological 
and ecosystem variables in the ocean (e.g., Hare and 
Mantua, 2000) and the location of the Kuroshio 
current in the western North Pacific Ocean (e.g., 
Qiu et al., 2007). 
 
The second leading mode of oceanic variability in the 
North Pacific is the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation 
(NPGO), formally defined as the second leading 
mode of Northeast Pacific SSHa and drives prominent 
low-frequency changes in physical and biological 
variables across the Pacific (e.g., SSTs, nutrients, 
chlorophyll-a) (e.g., Di Lorenzo et al. 2008, 2009).  
Recent work by Chhak et al. (2009) and Di Lorenzo et 
al. (2010) demonstrates that the NPGO is the oceanic 
response to atmospheric forcing associated with the 
North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), defined as the 
second leading mode of North Pacific SLPa (e.g., 
Walker and Bliss, 1932; Rogers, 1981; Linkin and 
Nigam, 2008).   The NPGO also has relations with the 
strength of the Kuroshio current in the western North 
Pacific Ocean (e.g., Ceballos et al., 2009). 
 
While the dynamics of these coupled 
ocean–atmosphere modes – namely the AL/PDO 
and NPO/NPGO – include elements independent of 
the tropics (e.g., Latif and Barnett, 1994; Barnett et  
 
al., 1999 and others), several studies have shown 
that significant fractions of the interannual (2–7 
year band) and decadal (>7 years) variability of 
both the AL/PDO and the NPO/NPGO are 
intimately tied to variations in the tropical Pacific 
(e.g., Alexander et al., 2002; Newman et al., 2003; 
Deser et al., 2004, 2006;  Di Lorenzo et al., 2010).  
The tropical Pacific variations are directly related to 
changes in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation 
(ENSO) phenomenon and a recently recognized 
“flavor” of ENSO known as El Niño-Modoki (e.g., 
Ashok et al., 2007) or Central Pacific Warming 
(CPW) (e.g., Kao et al., 2009) which concentrates 
the maximum SSTa in the central tropical Pacific, 
not the far eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, as during 
canonical ENSO events.   
 
Figure 3.8.1 summarizes the connections between 
large-scale modes of variability in the extratropical 
North Pacific and tropical Pacific.  The diagram 
consists of two “wheels” which represent the leading 
(red wheel) and secondary (blue wheel) modes of 
variability in the tropical and North Pacific basins.  
The red wheel illustrates that canonical ENSO events 
in the tropical Pacific connect to variability in the AL 
in the North Pacific, which is then integrated by the 
underlying ocean to form a substantial portion of the 
PDO signature.  The blue wheel illustrates that CPW 
events are statistically and dynamically linked to 
variations in the NPO (e.g., Di Lorenzo et al., 2010), 
which is then integrated to form the NPGO pattern.  
An additional element of interest in Figure 3.8.1 is the 
dynamical connection from the extratropical North 
Pacific to the tropical Pacific in the blue wheel.  This 
connection consists of the seasonal footprinting 
mechanism (SFM) (e.g., Vimont et al., 2001, 2003) 
whereby boreal wintertime variability in the NPO 
drives warm SSTa in the North Pacific that 
propagate into the central tropical Pacific by the end 
of spring/summer and initiates an ENSO-like 
response in the tropical Pacific.  If the response is a 
CPW-type event, a positive feedback loop occurs 
(Fig. 3.8.1, blue wheel).  This feedback may provide 
a longer year-to-year persistence of CPWs.

Pacific Climate Variability in IPCC Coupled 
Climate Models 
 
Figure 3.8.1 offers a dynamical framework that can 
be readily tested in state-of-the-art coupled climate 
models to see if the models are able to capture the 
links between the tropical and North Pacific modes 
of climate variability.  Such connections are critical 
for testing as the fidelity of the future climate 
change offered by the models are directly related to 
the way they capture these Pacific dynamical 
connections.  Furtado et al. (2011) provide a 
thorough examination of the major modes of North 
Pacific and tropical Pacific variability of the 
Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects phase 3 
(CMIP3) models used to write the Inter- 
governmental Panel on Climate Change 4th 
Assessment Report (IPCC AR4).  The authors focus 
on the 20th century hindcast simulations for 
evaluation (20C3M scenario) and quantitatively 
assess how well the models recover the leading 
modes of North Pacific climate variability in space 
and time, including their connections to the tropical 
Pacific.   
 
The findings illustrate that, in general, the models 
perform poorly in reproducing the inherent 
frequencies of the AL/PDO and the NPO/NPGO 
modes as well as the connections between the 
tropics and extratropics.  Figure 3.8.2 shows the 
spatial correlation between the leading modes of 
variability and covariability of North Pacific SLP 
and SST in the models versus observations for the 
20th century.  For the most part, the highest spatial 
correlations are for the leading modes of 
atmospheric patterns, not the ocean.  This result 
suggests that the oceanic components of the 
coupled models fail to capture significant aspects of 
the PDO and especially the NPGO.  Secondly, for 
the modes of covariability between North Pacific 
SST and SLP (i.e., combined EOFs; cEOFs), 
cEOF-2, which represents the NPO/NPGO mode, 
has less reproducibility in the models than the 
AL/PDO pattern.  This further suggests that there is 
a disconnect between the response of the North 
Pacific Ocean to the NPO forcing pattern within 
several of the models. 
 
For implications on future climate change, the models 
show no consensus on projected future changes in the 
frequency of either the PDO or NPGO.  No significant 
differences are anticipated in the spatial pattern or the 
frequency of either the PDO or the NPGO.  This lack 
of a consensus in changes in either mode also affects 
confidence in projected changes in the overlying 
atmospheric circulation, including the projected 
changes in storm tracks and atmospheric tele- 
connection patterns (e.g., Bengtsson et al., 2006; 
Ulbrich et al., 2008).  Since the wind stress curl 
induced by the AL and NPO are drivers to the leading 
Section 3 Activities of Working Group Members 
PICES Scientific Report No. 40 105 
modes of North Pacific SSTa, we would expect that 
changes in their characteristics would change the 
dominant SSTa patterns, but the models do not 
illustrate such a change, suggesting that the dynamical 
coupling between the extratropical atmosphere and 
ocean needs to be addressed further. 
 
The IPCC models are also deficient in replicating 
connections between the tropical Pacific and North 
Pacific in the models.  Figures 3.8.3 and 3.8.4 show 
the first two modes of covariability between 
tropical and extratropical Pacific SLP and SST for 
the observations (Fig. 3.8.3) and the models  
(Fig. 3.8.4).  Figure 3.8.3a and b clearly shows the 
canonical ENSO/PDO/AL connection in the first 
combined EOF in the observations, while Figure 
3.8.3c and d demonstrates the relationship between 
the NPO and the CPW phenomenon. The regression 
patterns associated with the ENSO/PDO/AL and 
CPW/NPO patterns are statistically significant and 
support the dynamical framework laid out in the 
introduction.  However, when the same combined 
EOFs are computed for the ensemble-mean of the 
24 CMIP3 models, the relationships between the 
extratropical North Pacific and tropical Pacific 
nearly vanish for both leading modes.  Figure 3.8.4 
shows the combined EOFs of North Pacific and 
tropical Pacific wintertime SLPa/SSTa.  For the 
first leading covariability mode (Fig. 3.8.4a and b), 
the models fail to capture a significant relationship 
with variability of the AL in the North Pacific (Fig. 
3.8.4a) and almost no sign of the PDO-like response 
in the extratropical North Pacific, as shown in 
observations (compare Fig. 3.8.4b with Fig. 3.8.3b).  
For the CPW/NPO/NPGO mode in the models  
(Fig. 3.8.4c and d), the North Pacific atmospheric 
response does not resemble the classical NPO 
signature, with instead, an insignificant broad 
region of low pressure encompassing the North 
Pacific (Fig. 3.8.4c).  The ensemble-mean SSTa 
regression pattern (Fig. 3.8.4d) shows the core of 
tropical Pacific warming displaced into the Warm 
Pool region.  Moreover, in the North Pacific, the 
pattern better resembles the PDO pattern than that 
seen in the first covariability pattern (Fig. 3.8.4b and 
d).  Though insignificant in the ensemble-mean, this 
difference suggests that variability associated with the 
PDO may have important connections with the second 
leading mode of tropical Pacific SSTa in many of the 
models, contrary to what is observed.  Such findings 
are consistent with other previous studies with the 
CMIP3 models (e.g., Newman, 2007).

Projected Changes in the Central Tropical 
Pacific and Impacts on North Pacific Climate 
 
The ability of the coupled climate models in 
simulating tropical Pacific–North Pacific modes of 
climate variability is questionable based on the results 
of Furtado et al. (2011) and other similar studies.  Yet, 
of late, the climate community has focused on 
apparent changes in ENSO frequency in the latter half 
of the 20th century and early 21st century, particularly 
on the apparent increase in CPW-type events in the 
SST record (e.g., Ashok et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2009).  
Whether this increase in CPW events is simply 
because of the short length of records or is due to 
some low-frequency change in the tropical Pacific 
climate system remains to be seen.  However, there 
are suggestions that CPW events will continue to 
increase in frequency and magnitude under global 
climate change (Yeh et al., 2009), meaning that 
understanding the fundamental dynamics of the 
phenomenon and its relation to the rest of the North 
Pacific is important to investigate.  This venture is 
especially important for verifying the proposed 
feedback loop between the CPW and the NPGO 
presented in Figure 3.8.1. 
 
Di Lorenzo et al. (2010) investigated the links 
between the CPW phenomenon and its connection to 
the NPGO, particularly since the two phenomena 
share a similar SSTa footprint in the tropical Pacific 
Ocean.  Using an ensemble of runs from a simple 
atmospheric model forced only with tropical Pacific 
SSTa (12°S–12°N), the authors demonstrated that 
central tropical Pacific SSTa force changes in the 
extratropical North Pacific, particularly the 
subtropical SLP field near Hawaii / the southern node 
of the NPO.  The SLP response then forces the 
underlying ocean and generates the decadal-scale 
signature of the NPGO.  Figure 3.8.5 recaps the main 
results from Di Lorenzo et al. (2010).  Figure 3.8.5a–d

(g) As in (f) but both indices filtered with a 7-year lowpass filter.  The correlation between the two low-passed indices is

establishes the statistical relationship between the 
CPW and the NPGO.  Note that both phenomena 
share common areas of correlation in the central 
tropical Pacific in SSTa (Fig. 3.8.5a and c) and also in 
SLPa, especially in the subtropical North Pacific near 
the Hawaiian Islands (Fig. 3.8.5b and d).  The link 
between the central tropical Pacific SSTa and the 
NPGO variability is made apparent in the AR-1 model 
reconstructions presented in Figure 3.8.5e–g.   
Figure 3.8.5e establishes from observations that, 
indeed, the SLPa Hawaii index significantly captures 
nearly 44% of the variability in the NPGO index.  
When using the ensemble-mean from the model, 
nearly 30% is recovered in the model, which is 
statistically significant but, more importantly, 
remarkable for the simple model experiments 
performed.  Finally, to show that some decadal-scale 
changes in the North Pacific are driven by the CPW 
phenomenon, the 7-year low-passed NPGO and 
model-reconstructed NPGO indices show excellent 
agreement (r = 0.85; p < 0.01). 
 
Taken together, these results suggest that the 
low-frequency nature of the NPGO, which controls 
climate and ecosystem variations in the North Pacific, 
originates from variability associated with the CPW 
phenomenon.  Such a result parallels previous studies 
that have connected canonical ENSO variability with 
variability in the PDO (e.g., Alexander et al., 2002; 
Newman et al., 2003; Vimont, 2005).  Given the 
uncertainties in tropical Pacific climate in the future 
and the inability of many coupled climate models to 
Section 3 Activities of Working Group Members 
PICES Scientific Report No. 40 109 
agree on a change or agree on governing dynamics in 
the extratropical–tropical Pacific climate system, 
there exists large uncertainties on the future state of 
Pacific decadal climate variability.  If projections of 
increased CPW frequency and magnitude are accurate 
(e.g., Yeh et al., 2009), then the results in Figure 3.8.5 
illustrate that we might expect an increased variance 
in the NPGO phenomenon as well, which would alter 
the background state of the North Pacific and its 
ecosystems.

Introduction 
 
Comprehensive Atmosphere–Ocean General 
Circulation Models (AOGCMs) comprise the major 
objective tool that scientists use to account for the 
complex interaction of processes that determine 
future climate change.  Such model projections 
formed the basis of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change 4th Assessment Report (IPCC AR4, 
Solomon et al., 2007) and are now archived as part of 
the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 
(CMIP3; Meehl et al., 2007).  While global climate 
models provide credible quantitative estimates of 
future climate at continental scales and above 
(Solomon et al., 2007), the projections at regional 
scales from these climate models have a larger spread 
and uncertainty.  Yet climate projections at regional 
scales are in increased demand from governments, 
management agencies and other stakeholders. 
Regional projections from these models are also being 
used by management agencies to assess and plan for 
future ecological and societal impacts.  While it is 
clear that the CMIP3 models are better than the earlier 
models used for the 3rd Assessment Report (Randall 
et al., 2007; Reichler and Kim, 2008), there remains a 
general question: how reliable are these model 
projections at regional scales and what is the limit of 
their utility?  There are, in fact, considerable 
differences in the models’ ability to hindcast regional 
climate variability based on location, variable of 
interest, and metrics – e.g., means, variance, trends – 
with no convergence toward a single subset of 
preferred models.  Thus, the question of model 
reliability has no simple quantitative answer; there is 
no one best model (Räisänen 2007; Gleckler et al., 
2008; Reifen and Toumi, 2009).  
 
In this report, we assess 24 models that submitted 
their simulation results to the Program for Climate 
Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI; 
http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/info_for_analysts.php). 
Model names, the contributing country and their 
resolutions for the atmosphere and ocean, as well as 
the number of ensemble runs submitted, are 
summarized in Table 3.9.1. Although there is emerging 
evidence of the utility of some regional climate model 
projections, users should strive to evaluate 
uncertainties in the multiple model simulations. We 
present a set of considerations to guide regional 
applications of CMIP3, that is, to extract the future 
climate projections from current available models at 
regional scales, with careful model culling for each 
variable of our interest.  Below, we present our results 
for two selected variables which are important to the 
Bering Sea marine ecosystem. 
 
There are three main sources of uncertainty in the use 
of AOGCMs for climate projections: large natural 
variations (both forced and unforced), the range in 
emissions scenarios, and across-model differences 
(Hawkins and Sutton, 2009).  First, it is known that if 
climate models are run several times with slightly 
different initial conditions, the trajectory of day-to-day 
and, indeed, year-to-year evolution, will have different 
timing of events even though the underlying 
statistical-spectral character of the model climate tends 
to be similar for each run.  This variability is a feature 
of the real climate system, and users of climate 
projections must recognize its importance. Natural 
variability is a source of ambiguity in the comparison 
of models with each other and with observational data. 
This uncertainty can affect decadal, or even longer 
means, so it is highly relevant to the use of 
model-derived climate projections. 
 
A second source of uncertainty arises from the range 
in plausible emissions scenarios. Emissions scenarios 
have been developed based on assumptions of future 
development of technology and population 
(Nakicenovic et al., 2000).  So the greenhouse gases 
and aerosol concentrations are derived based on 
assumptions, which are then used to drive the 
AOGCMs in the form of external forcing specified in 
the CMIP3 models, as summarized in the IPCC AR4. 
Because of the residence time of carbon in the 
atmosphere and the thermal inertia of the climate 
system, climate projections are often relatively 
insensitive to the precise details of which future 
Activities of Working Group Members Section 3 
112  PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
emissions scenarios are used over the next few 
decades, as the impacts of the scenarios are rather 
similar before mid-21st century (Hawkins and Sutton, 
2009).  For the second half of the 21st century, 
however, and especially by 2100, the choice of the 
emission scenario becomes a major source of 
uncertainty of climate projections and dominates over 
natural variability, at least for temperature, and 
model-to-model differences (Solomon et al., 2007). 
 
The third source of uncertainty is termed 
across-model uncertainty, which can be separated into 
parameterization uncertainty and structural 
uncertainty (Knutti, 2008). Due to the coarse 
resolution of global climate models, and due to 
computational restrain, sub-grid scale processes must 
be parameterized, requiring specification of 
functional relationships and tuning of attendant 
coefficients.  Different numerical approximations of 
the model equations, spatial resolution, and other 
model development factors introduce structural 
uncertainty between different models. 
 
Model uncertainty can be addressed, in part, through 
consideration of multi-model ensemble means.  
Below, through a few examples, we show how the 
ensemble mean can be constructed for two variables 
important to the ecosystem components of the Bering 
Sea.  We used a two-step model culling strategy in 
which model variables are assessed in a large-scale 
content first, and then further evaluated on the 
regional scale, as illustrated by Figure 3.9.1. 
 
 
North Pacific Sea Surface Temperature 
 
Major changes in species distribution and abundance 
in North Pacific marine ecosystems are often 
  
correlated with climatic shifts in the 20th century, 
including halibut in the Gulf of Alaska, sardine near 
Japan and various species along the Oregon/ 
California coast (Peterson and Schwing 2003; Zhang 
et al. 2004; Chen and Hare, 2006). Over the North 
Pacific, the major mode of variability in the sea 
surface temperature (SST) field is the Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation (PDO) (Zhang et al., 1997; Mantua and 
Hare, 2002), which is identified by the leading mode 
of Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) of observed 
winter (November–March) North Pacific SST.  The 
PDO has a general east/west dipole spatial structure 
(Fig. 3.9.2A) and decadal variability (dashed red line 
Fig. 3.9.2B).  EOFs are an efficient way to display the 
relative importance of covariance in spatial fields, 
although they are a statistical pattern and not based 
directly on dynamics.  When we applied EOF analysis 
to the model-simulated SST over the North Pacific, 
we found that 12 out of 23 models simulated the PDO 
close to the observed pattern, both spatially and 
temporally (Overland and Wang, 2007; Wang et al., 
2010). These models are CCSM3, CGCM3.1 (T47), 
CGCM3.1 (T63), ECHAM5, ECHO-G, GFDL-CM2.0, 
GFDL-CM2.1, MIROC3.2 (hires), MIROC3.2 
(medres), MRI, PCM1, and UKHadCM3. When an 
EOF analysis is applied to the SST of the 21st century 
model projections, the first EOF of SST variability 
from these models is a new, rather uniform, 
single-signed loading pattern (Fig. 3.9.2C) with a 
corresponding principal component (PC) time series 
showing an upward trend (solid blue line, Fig. 3.9.2B). 
Now, the second leading pattern of the 21st century 
SST variability (Fig. 3.9.2D) shows the spatial 
variability of the PDO dipole pattern, similar to the 
20th century observed field (Fig. 3.9.2A).  The spatial 
correlation between these two patterns is 0.82.

Arctic Sea Ice Extent 
 
Even though climate models show that future 
temperature increases from anthropogenic forcing are 
amplified at high latitudes due to positive feedbacks 
involving snow, sea ice and ocean process, the Arctic 
is, in fact, changing even faster than anticipated from 
model projections summarized by the IPCC AR4 
(Serreze and Francis, 2006; Serreze et al. 2007; 
Solomon et al., 2007; Stroeve et al., 2007).  After the 
sharp decline in the sea ice coverage of summer 2007, 
we have seen a consecutive four years of least sea ice 
extent over the history of the satellite era (Fig. 3.9.3).  
This might be a reflection of the positive feedback in 
the Arctic climate system due to significant reduction 
of the sea ice. 
 
Many projections from CMIP3 models show an 
increased rate of sea ice loss when sea ice extent is 
near the present 4.6 million km
2
 mark compared to sea 
ice extents before 2000, which suggests increased 
impacts of ocean/ice feedback processes when the 
summer Arctic Ocean open water area increases. 
Applying observational constraints (mean and 
seasonal cycle) to model-simulated Northern 
Hemispheric sea ice extent for the 1980–1999 period, 
Wang and Overland (2009) identified 6 models 
(CCSM3, CNRM-CM3, ECHO-G, IPSL-CM4, 
MIROC3.2 (medres) and UKHadGEM1) that show 
reasonable fidelity to the observed sea ice extent in 
the 20th century.  The selection process reduces the 
range of uncertainties in the future projections by 
these models as shown in Figure 3.9.4.   It also shows 
that the models reproduced reasonable seasonal 
cycles relative to the observations, predicting faster 
sea ice decline (thick blue line in Fig. 3.9.4) than all 
model ensemble means (thick yellow line).

Projection of Bering Sea Future Climate 
 
The Bering Sea, located in the north end of the Pacific 
Ocean, is connected to the Arctic Ocean through the 
Bering Strait.  Its geographic location determines that 
its climate is influenced by the changes in the Arctic 
from the north and the Pacific from the south.  Here, 
we take the SST and sea ice coverage as two examples 
to illustrate how the global climate models are being 
assessed and culled for the Bering Sea projection. 
 
Sea surface temperature  
Since the Bering Sea is seasonally covered by sea ice, 
sea ice simulation will have an impact on its SST 
status for the region. We start with 15 models 
identified by Wang and Overland (2009), and Wang et 
al. (2010), which simulated either the sea ice 
condition over the Arctic or the PDO feature in North 
Pacific well.  We then further evaluate these models’ 
performance at a regional scale over the Bering Sea 
for each variable independently before we select a 
subgroup of models to make projections for the future. 
Considering the significant difference of physical 
oceanic conditions resulting from the underlying 
bathymetry, we further divide the Bering Sea into the 
eastern Bering (54°–66°N, 165°E–175°W), and the 
western Bering (54°–66°N, 175°–155°W).  Figure 
3.9.5 shows the climatology of the SST with the 
annual mean removed over the eastern (Fig. 3.9.5a) 
and western (Fig. 3.9.5b) Bering Sea from 7 out of the 
15 models (ECHAM5/MPI, GFDL-CM2.0, GFDL- 
CM2.1, IPSL-CM4, MIROC3.2 (medres), MRI- 
CAOGCM2.3.3, and UKHadGEM1) that simulated 
the seasonal cycle in reasonable agreement with 
observations.  The seasonal cycle is well captured by 
these 7 models, and besides, all models have correctly 
placed maximum SST in August. 
 
Projections of future SST for the eastern and western 
Bering Sea are shown in Figures 3.9.6 and 3.9.7.   An 
apparent and similar upward linear trend in the SST 
field is seen over both sides of the Bering Sea.  By the 
end of the 21st century, about a 3 °C temperature 
increase is projected by the ensemble mean for each 
month.

Sea ice extent 
 
As discussed in the introduction, sea ice plays an 
important role not only in the physical environment, 
but also provides habitat for marine mammals such as 
seals and polar bears.  Starting with the 6 models 
identified by Wang and Overland (2009) that passed 
the performance criteria, we further evaluate these 6 
models for their performance over the eastern Bering 
Sea and the western Bering Sea, independently.  We 
found that 4 out of the 6 models perform reasonable 
well for the eastern Bering Sea (Fig. 3.9.8a), and only 
few runs from one model perform well in the western 
Bering Sea (Fig. 3.9.8b).  This allows projections to 
be made from 4 models (CCSM3, CNRM-CM3, 
ECHO-G, and MIROC3.2 (medres)) for the eastern 
Bering Sea. Since only one model produced the 
climatology well in the western Bering Sea, at this 
point we do not have enough confidence to provide 
projections for the future sea ice extent for this region. 
This is because a single model could not provide 
enough runs to assess the uncertainty.  
 
Figure 3.9.9 displays the projected sea ice extent from 
the models for selected months (December, February, 
April and June) over the eastern Bering Sea under 
both the A1B and A2 emissions scenarios.  In late fall 
or early winter (December), there is sea ice cover over 
 
the eastern Bering Sea, even by the middle of the 21st 
century, yet the declining trend is visually obvious. 
The same is true for late winter (February) and spring 
(April).  The grey lines from the models show that the 
interannual variability of the sea ice extent is large in 
these two months, compared with other time periods 
of the year.  By the end of spring (June), sea ice is 
basically gone. This is true for the last few decades, 
and will be true in the future although occasionally 
there can be a year that sea ice still exists in part of the 
eastern Bering in June, but this is rare.  The estimated 
downward trend is –2.1 × 10
3
 km
2
 /year for December, 
–3.0 × 10
3
 km
2
 for February, and –2.7 × 10
3
 km
2
 for 
April.  There is no ice cover over the eastern Bering 
Sea during the summer and fall (July to November). 
The decline in sea ice extent is projected to occur 
faster in winter months in the first half of the 21st 
century than in the second half.  For example, the 
linear decline trend is –3.9 × 10
3
 km
2
/year for 
2000–2049, and is –0.5 × 10
3
 km
2
/year for 2050–2099. 
By 2050, the averaged sea ice extent would be 28% of 
present day value (relative to the 1980–1999 period 
mean), whereas the spring sea ice extent (average of 
March to May) would be at 58% of the present value. 
By 2075 the spring sea ice extent would be reduced to 
37% of the present day value, and the autumn would 
be at only 12% of the present day value (figures not 
shown).

Each grey line represents one realization by these models. 
 
 
Summary 
 
We suggest transparent choices regarding selection 
methods. In fact, one should view the process as 
reducing the impact of models with large hindcast 
error, i.e., culling, rather than the selection of best 
models, while retaining several models as a measure 
of model uncertainty.  Credibility is gained when the 
model selection procedure is simple and thoroughly 
documented. We can recommend the following steps: 
 
1. In many applications, it is advisable to eliminate 
the models that seriously fail to meet one or more 
observational constraints on continental scales, 
based on comparison with actual or synthetic data 
(e.g., reanalysis products) for climatically 
relevant variables such as sea level pressure, sea 
surface temperature, seasonal sea ice extents, or 
upper air variables.  Do the selected variables 
have reasonable mean, variance, and seasonal 
cycle close to the observations at a continental 
scale or above?  It bears noting that even 
reproducing mean quantities approximately 
correct is non-trivial, as the CMIP3 models are 
initialized in the 19th century. 
2. After eliminating poorly performing models 
based on continental scale climate processes, the 
remaining subset of models is evaluated for 
individual variables and regions of interest.   
These are user selected for the problem at hand, 
such as a variable with an ecosystem or societal 
impact.  Our analyses of AOGCM hindcast 
simulations show that models can perform 
differently based on region and for different 
variables within a region, often without obvious 
reasons (Overland and Wang 2007; Walsh et al., 
2008).  Nevertheless, it is plausible that the 
uncertainties of future climate projections would 
be reduced among models with better regional 
hindcast simulations.  
 
3. Model uncertainty is a sampling problem, so a 
sample size of at least several models is desirable. 
Model means selected by multi-variable metrics 
can outperform any individual model (Walsh et 
al., 2008).  Natural variability is a complicating 
factor in using models when only one ensemble 
member is available. 
 
Activities of Working Group Members Section 3 
120 PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
In general, the quality of individual model simulations 
depends on the variable, region, and evaluation metric. 
The reasons for these inconsistencies are rarely clear, 
which bears on the credibility of the models’ results 
on regional scales.  Nevertheless, there is certainly 
interest in regional projections. Further, the 
top-performing models for many of the cases that we 
have investigated tend to be more sensitive to 
greenhouse forcing than the poorer-performing 
models, suggesting that all-model means do not 
provide unbiased projections. 
 
As illustrated by the examples in the preceding 
section, the strategy for dealing with climate model 
uncertainties can be keyed to several considerations.  
First, the available models of opportunity can be 
evaluated based on the ability of their 20th century 
hindcasts to reproduce large-scale climate variability. 
This variability can include the annual cycle of certain 
variables that are responsive to radiative forcing; it 
can also include leading spatial and/or temporal 
modes of variability.  Such an evaluation serves as a 
climatic basis for culling some models from further 
consideration.   Second, one can consider 20th century 
hindcasts of problem-relevant variables in the region 
of interest for further selection of models.  While it 
may be tempting to determine a single best model and 
use its projections, this practice has serious risks.  All 
climate models are subject to model uncertainty, and 
prior success may be fortuitous (Reifen and Toumi, 
2009).   Moreover, the spread in the projections from 
different models provides a measure of one major 
source of uncertainty of projections. Finally, 
consideration can be given to the sophistication of 
each model vis-à-vis the parameters of interest.  For 
example, the models with more elaborate schemes for 
handling sea ice tended to compare better with 
observations, and thus have increased credibility for 
Arctic applications.

Working Group on North Pacific Climate Variability and Change (WG 27) Terms of Reference 
 
Approved at the 2011 Inter-sessional Science Board Meeting 
 
Parent Committee:  POC 
 
Co-Chairmen:  Michael Foreman, Shoshiro Minobe, Emanuele Di Lorenzo

Approved at the 2011 Inter-sessional Science Board Meeting 
 
Parent Committee:  POC 
 
Co-Chairmen:  Chan Joo Jang and Enrique Curchitser 
 
Motivation: 
 
With the realization that physically-based future climate projections are the starting point for many 
socio-economic impact and adaptation considerations to future climate change and that global climate models, 
although they capture large scale climate behaviour, have limitations for regional assessments due to their coarse 
spatial resolutions, a working group is proposed to assess state-of-the-art regional climate modeling efforts, their 
implications for regional ecosystem studies and to further their development in the North Pacific Ocean and its 
marginal seas. 
 
Terms of Reference: 
 
1. Assemble a comprehensive review of existing regional climate modeling efforts;  
2. Assess the requirements for regional ecosystem modeling studies (e.g., how to downscale the 
biogeochemistry);  
3. Continue the development of RCM implementations in the North Pacific and its marginal seas;  
4. Convene special sessions and inter-sessional workshops dedicated to the RCM topic;  
5. Publish report and/or review paper on best practices for regional coupled modeling;  
6. Establish connections between PICES and climate organizations (e.g., CLIVAR) and global climate 
modeling centers (e.g., NCAR, JAMSTEC, CCCMA);  
7. Collaborate with other PICES expert groups such as WG-27, SICCME and the FUTURE Advisory Panels 
possibly by producing “Outlooks”;  
8. Publish a final report summarizing results.

2006 Report of Working Group on 
Evaluations of Climate Change Predictions 
 
The Working Group (WG 20) on Evaluations of 
climate change projections held its first meeting in the 
afternoon of October 14, 2006.  The Co-Chairmen, 
Drs. Michael G. Foreman and Yasuhiro Yamanaka, 
called the meeting to order and welcomed the 
participants.  The meeting was attended by 10 
Working Group members and 28 observers 
representing all PICES member countries and several 
international organizations (WG 20 Endnote 1). 
 
The meeting began with a brief presentation by Dr. 
Akihiko Yatsu, Co-Chairman of the CFAME Task 
Team, on the objectives and progress of that group.  
Dr. Foreman then led a discussion on how WG 20 
might collaborate with CFAME in providing climate 
change scenario information that would be useful for 
the third component (Scenarios) of the CFAME 
workplan.  Drs. Arthur Miller, Emanuele Di Lorenzo 
and Enrique Curchitser, all members of WG 20 who 
have already developed high-resolution models for 
the California Current system that have been, or are 
soon to be run with climate forcing, agreed to work 
with Dr. Vera Agostini of CFAME in providing 
physical information that would be useful for her 
ecosystem model of that region.  Dr. Hiroyasu 
Hasumi agreed to work with Dr. Yamanaka in 
providing analogous data from his climate models in 
the Kuroshio/Oyashio region.  Dr. Ig-Chan Pang 
volunteered to adapt his one-tenth of a degree 
circulation model for the Yellow and East China Seas 
so that it could accept boundary and atmospheric 
forcing from one, or an ensemble, of IPCC global 
climate model scenario runs.  (In subsequent 
discussion with Dr. Foreman he also agreed to contact 
Dr. Jai-Ho Oh, another WG 20 member (not present), 
to see if it would be feasible to use high-resolution 
atmospheric forcing produced by Dr. Oh’s models for 
some of these simulations.)  In the absence of a 
high-resolution circulation model for the Sea of 
Okhotsk, it was decided that an ensemble of climate 
model results could be provided to Dr. Victor Lapko 
for understanding possible changes to that ecosystem.  
It was not determined who would compute this 
ensemble, but Dr. Muyin Wang, on behalf of Dr. 
James E. Overland, proposed (see second paragraph 
below for more details) that calculations of this type 
be carried out for all sub-Arctic seas (including the 
Sea of Okhotsk) under the auspices of the GLOBEC 
regional program on Ecosystem Studies of Sub-Arctic 
Seas (ESSAS).  So the ensemble might be computed 
in collaboration with that group. 
 
It was also decided (subject to confirmation by 
CFAME and approval by Science Board) to convene a 
joint WG 20/CFAME workshop on “Climate 
scenarios for ecosystem modeling” at PICES XVI 
(CFAME Endnote 4).  This was subsequently 
approved with Drs. Jacquelynne R. King and Michael 
G. Foreman to be the co-convenors.  The suggested 
duration of the workshop is 1.5 days, with a format 
being 0.5 days with the groups separate, 0.5 days 
together and then 0.5 days apart again. 
 
Dr. Kenneth Drinkwater (ESSAS SSC Co-Chairman) 
gave a presentation on the ESSAS goals and activities, 
with particular attention paid to a workshop they are 
organizing in June 2007, in Hakodate, Japan.  Under 
Dr. Overland’s leadership, this workshop is planning 
to initiate the evaluation of climate change projections 
for each of the ESSAS regions, and it was agreed to 
submit, through POC, a travel request for one WG 20 
member to attend this meeting. 
 
The issue of financial support for WG 20 members to 
carry out research relevant to the Terms of Reference 
was also briefly discussed.  Dr. Foreman pointed out 
that although the North Pacific Research Board 
(NPRB) does have a request for proposals due 
December 1, 2006, these proposals must fall under the 
Board’s Science Plan.  As that plan does not have 
provision for physical or climate modeling, it 
precludes NPRB as a potential funding source.  The 
Bering Sea Integrated Ecosystem Research Program 
of NPRB is expected to release a request for proposals 
soon but it remains to be seen if WG 20 activities 
might be supported from that source.  Though WG 20 
is happy to provide letters of support and generally 
facilitate individual members in seeking out funding 
from their national sources, it does not appear that 
there are international vehicles to provide this 
support. 
 
WG 20 Annual Reports Appendix 5 
 PICES Scientific Report No. 40 130 
The issue of collaborations with international 
organizations/programs was briefly discussed.  Dr. 
William R. Crawford, a Canadian member of the 
CLIVAR Pacific Panel, stated that although this 
group seems primarily concerned with the tropical 
Pacific, it is indeed interested in the PICES region 
north of 30°N.  It was suggested that an invitation 
should be extended to the CLIVAR Pacific Panel to 
attend the next WG 20 workshop. 
 
The final item of discussion was a draft outline of the 
integrative science program, FUTURE, that PICES is 
hoping to initiate in the next couple of years.  The 
latest version of the program outline was presented, 
and it was pointed out that the activities of WG 20 fit 
very well with the proposal.  No specific suggestions 
for revisions were given but all were encouraged to 
attend either the POC meeting on October 18, or the 
Open Forum on October 19, where further discussions 
were planned.

PICES Scientific Report No. 40 131
PICES Fifteenth Annual Meeting Workshop Summary 
 
POC Workshop (W5) 
Evaluation of climate change projections 
 
Convenors: Michael G. Foreman (Canada) and Yasuhiro Yamanaka (Japan) 
 
Background 
 
The most recent set of global climate model 
projections has been submitted to, and is being 
analyzed by, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) for the publication of their Fourth 
Assessment Report in 2007.  PICES Working Group 
20 was created to evaluate these projections for the 
North Pacific and its marginal seas, and to compute 
products such as ensemble averages, that would assist 
PICES groups like the Climate Forcing and Marine 
Ecosystem Response Task Team (CFAME), in their 
analysis of climate effects on marine ecosystems, and 
ecosystem feedbacks to climate.  In this workshop, 
presentations and discussions focused on ongoing 
research that addresses the Terms of Reference of the 
Working Group, and on strategies for future work that 
are needed to fill the gaps.  Presentations related to the 
direct analysis of global climate projections and the 
calculation of ensemble averages; results from 
higher-resolution regional ocean and coupled 
atmosphere-ocean models that are forced by, and take 
their boundary conditions from the IPCC models; and 
the development of local and regional data sets (e.g., 
SST, river flow, sea ice cover) based on either model 
projections or historical observations were solicited.  
The development of work/action plans, liaisons with 
other PICES groups and outside organizations (e.g., 
CLIVAR), and future activities were discussed. 
 
Summary of presentations 
 
This workshop consisted of 3 invited talks, 11 oral 
presentations, and a brief business meeting that 
discussed future activities of the Working Group 20.  
In a brief introduction, Michael Foreman welcomed 
all participants, outlined the agenda for the day, and 
reviewed the Terms of Reference of WG 20.  Yoshiro 
Yamanaka then introduced all speakers for the 
morning part of the session. 
 
The first invited speaker, Curtis Covey, briefly 
described his experience in managing and using the 
archive of climate model output created by the 
Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and 
Intercomparison (PCMDI) at Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory for the IPCC Fourth Assessment 
Report (AR4).  He summarized the IPCC objectives, 
including the release of their upcoming report and 
plans for adding biogeochemistry to the next 
generation of climate models, and gave two 
interesting examples of analyses arising from the 
model output.  The next speaker, Hiroyasu Hasumi, 
presented an overview of results from two 
CCSR/NIES/FRCGC (Japan) climate models, one of 
which has the highest spatial resolution of all the 
IPCC models.  His presentation focused on analyses 
aimed at understanding the different results that arise 
from this finer resolution.  His ongoing comparison 
among high and medium resolution ocean general 
circulation models (OGCMs) with the same 
atmospheric forcing will provide useful information 
for constructing regional high resolution models 
forced by one, or an ensemble, of IPCC global climate 
model scenario runs.  Muyin Wang next presented 
results from an analysis of IPCC models showing that 
a basin wide warming signal under the IPCC SRES 
A1B scenario is predicted to surpass the Pacific 
Decadal Oscillation as the leading mode of variability 
in the North Pacific in the next forty years.  The 
spatial pattern of the model-projected temperature 
trends is more uniform than the east-west dipole 
pattern of the PDO.  Michael Foreman briefly 
summarized the major results of 11 recently published 
papers, each of which presented direct or derived 
results from individual or ensembles of climate 
models for the North Pacific.  The results covered 
changes in oceanic properties ranging from sea 
surface temperature and salinity to the Rossby radius 
of deformation and shoaling of the depth at which 
calcifying organisms dissolve.  However, there was 
not always consensus among the models.  The final 
speaker before the morning coffee break, Rong-Shuo 
Cai, described observed climate changes in the East 
and South China seas over the last 50 years.  These 
included a weakening of the summer and winter 
winds, increases in the sea surface temperature, and 
more frequent occurrences of red tides. 
 
The morning session after coffee began with a second 
invited speaker, Michio Kawamiya, describing the 
positive feedback that arises when carbon cycle 
interactions are included in climate change models, 
and the inter-comparison project, Coupled Climate 
Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project 
(C4MIP), that seeks to understand the differing results 
WG 20 Annual Reports Appendix 5 
132 PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
among various models that incorporate this cycle.  
Another invited speaker, Keith Rodgers, followed 
with description of his modelling study of variability 
in equatorial Pacific biogeochemistry and ecosystems, 
for which a major result was a de-coupling of the 
pycnocline and nutricline.  He pointed out a difference 
in simulated iron supply associated with equatorial 
upwelling between two re-analyse data sets:  National 
Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and 
European Centre for Medium-range Weather 
Forecasts (ECWMF), especially after the 1970s.  
Sang-Wook Yeh next described differences in 
observed sea surface temperatures warming trends in 
the North and Equatorial Pacific over epochs extending 
from the early 1900s to the present.  The final speaker 
of the morning, Zhenya Song, demonstrated the 
importance of including the mixing from surface waves 
in global model simulations by comparing 
climatological observations with model results. 
The first speaker in the afternoon, Elena Ustinova, 
described spectral analyses of, and correlations 
between, time series of sea ice extent and air and 
water temperature in the Okhotsk and eastern Bering 
Seas.  William Crawford followed with an analysis of 
50 years of salinity and temperature observations 
along Line-P.  His main result was that many changes 
are strongly related to changes in the predominant 
wind direction.  Hee-Dong Jeong carried out a similar 
analysis of 37 years of temperature observations 
around the Korean Peninsula, finding different trends 
in three sub-regions and in different depth ranges.  
Masao Ichii then described analyses of observations 
of total inorganic carbon and dissolved oxygen along 
the 165°E transect between 28°N and 50°N.  His 
results suggested that changes were more likely due to 
variability in the circulation or biogeochemistry rather 
than the uptake of CO
2
.  The final speaker, 
Dong-Young Lee, described the problems associated 
with estimating design wave heights in light of 
climate change.

Victoria, Canada 
 
2007 Report of Working Group 20 on 
Evaluations of Climate Change Predictions 
 
 
The Working Group on Evaluations of Climate 
Change Projections (hereafter WG 20) held its second 
meeting from 14:00–18:00 hours on October 27, 2007.  
After introductory formalities to members and 
observers (WG 20 Endnote 1) were conducted by 
Co-Chairmen, Drs. Michael G. Foreman and 
Yasuhiro Yamanaka, the draft agenda was reviewed 
and adopted without changes (WG 20 Endnote 2).  Dr. 
Muyin Wang agreed to serve as the rapporteur. 
 
Discussion of a workshop with CFAME and update 
on Terms of Reference (Agenda Items 3 and 4) 
 
The meeting began with a discussion of the recently 
concluded joint workshop on “Climate scenarios for 
ecosystem modeling” (W6) with the Climate Forcing 
and Marine Ecosystems Task Team (CFAME).  The 
following was requested by CFAME from WG 20, 
preferably by their inter-sessional meeting in April 
2008 and certainly by their final meeting in October 
2008: 
 
1. Graphic representations of climate/ocean states 
under climate warming for each of the three 
ecosystems selected by CFAME.  For the 
Kuroshio/Oyashio, this representation will be 
based on detailed model results available from a 
high-resolution Japanese global climate model to 
which Dr. Yamanaka has coupled his biological 
COCO–NEMURO model.  For the California 
Current System, this representation will be based 
on either results from a high-resolution Regional 
Ocean Model System (ROMS) climate model, or 
if this is not available, from downscaled global 
climate model values.  For the Yellow and East 
China Seas, this graphic will also be based on 
either regional climate model output or 
downscaled values from global climate models. 
2. Detailed output from Dr. Yamanaka’s 
COCO–NEMURO model simulations for the 
Kuroshio/Oyashio region for 2007–2030 (or 
whatever projection time period he chooses). 
3. A comparison of the atmospheric component in 
the Japanese high-resolution Model for 
Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) 
with other climate models to assess the range of 
variability and determine any biases that could 
potentially affect the results arising from (2) 
above. 
4. Climate change variables (such as SST, 
stratification, circulation) for the California 
Current System (north, central and south 
sub-regions) that have either been taken from 
regional climate models, or downscaled from 
global climate models. 
 
The second and fourth requests were viewed as 
potentially longer-term products that could be 
included in the CFAME final report to provide future 
PICES groups with relevant climate parameters.  Dr. 
Foreman will work with regional representatives in 
coordinating delivery of the first request.  Dr. 
Yamanaka will work on the second, Drs. Wang and 
James E. Overland will work on the third, and Dr. 
Foreman will work with Drs. Wang, Overland, 
Enrique Curchitser, Arthur J. Miller and Emanuele Di 
Lorenzo on the fourth.  It was also reported that 
CFAME will invite the WG 20 Co-Chairmen to attend 
their inter-sessional meeting in Honolulu in April 
2008 (CFAME Endnote 3) in order to receive 
immediate feedback on revised descriptions of 
relevant physical processes for the three selected 
ecosystems. 
 
In addition to the updates on WG 20 activities, Dr. 
Miller gave a short presentation on a recent climate 
workshop on “The known, unknown, and 
unknowable“ at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, and Dr. Young-Gyu Park provided an 
update on his regional Finite Volume Coastal Ocean 
Model (FVCOM) for the waters surrounding Korea. 
 
Next major PICES scientific program (Agenda 
Item 5) 
 
A lively discussion took place on the latest draft 
(version 4.2) of a Science Plan for a new PICES 
integrative scientific program on Forecasting and 
Understanding Trends, Uncertainties and Responses 
of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems (FUTURE).  Dr. 
Foreman felt that physical and geochemical issues 
were not given sufficient recognition in the Science 
WG 20 Annual Reports  Appendix 5 
134 PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
Plan for the role they will be playing in providing 
forecasts (and associated uncertainties) of ecosystems 
that are changing due to climate and other 
anthropogenic effects.  Possible revisions to key and 
secondary questions were discussed and general 
agreement was given to a draft presentation by POC at 
the FUTURE Open Forum on November 1. 
 
Future WG 20 workshops and meetings (Agenda 
Item 6) 
 
Dr. Foreman briefly described the upcoming 
International Symposium on the “Effects of climate 
change on the world’s oceans” to be convened May 
19–23, 2008, in Gijón, Spain.  PICES has booked a 
room so that WG 20 can hold an informal meeting at  
this symposium if a sufficient number of members 
attend.  The invitation to participate in this meeting 
was also extended to CFAME members. 
 
CFAME has expressed interest in holding another 
joint workshop with WG 20 on “Climate scenarios for 
ecosystem modeling II” at the 2008 PICES Annual 
Meeting (CFAME Endnote 4).  Dr. Gordon A. 
(Sandy) McFarlane (CFAME) will be co-convening 
the workshop with either Dr. Foreman or Dr. 
Yamanaka. 
 
Items with financial implications (Agenda Item 7) 
 
Travel support was requested for: 
   one WG 20 member to attend the next ESSAS 
Annual Meeting to be held in September 2008, in 
Halifax, Canada; 
   Dr. Foreman to attend the Gijón Symposium 
where he will be co-convening a session on “Past 
and future variability and change in ocean 
climate:  Climate model projections”. 
 
Other business (Agenda Item 8) 
 
No other business was discussed.

PICES Sixteenth Annual Meeting Workshop Summary 
 
 
POC/CCCC Workshop (W6) 
Climate scenarios for ecosystem modeling  
 
Co-Convenors:  Jacquelynne R. King (Canada) and Michael G. Foreman (Canada) 
 
Background 
 
The objective of this workshop was to facilitate 
discussion between CFAME and Working Group on 
Evaluations of Climate Change Projections (WG 20) 
on potential future collaborative research on 
forecasting the impacts of climate change (as 
represented by IPCC projection scenarios) on regional 
ecosystems and species of the North Pacific.  The 
workshop began with overviews of the Terms of 
Reference and workplans for CFAME and WG 20 by 
their Co-chairmen, Kerim Aydin (CFAME) and 
Michael Foreman (WG 20).  The overviews provided 
the context for overlap in research foci between these 
two groups.  CFAME has focused on three North 
Pacific ecosystems that represent different dominant 
physical processes:  1) California Current System 
(boundary current with upwelling); 2) 
Kuroshio/Oyashio Current System (boundary 
currents); 3) Yellow Sea/East China Sea Region 
(freshwater input).  For each ecosystem, CFAME has 
developed conceptual models of the mechanisms 
relating climate forcing to the population dynamics of 
key species and to ecosystem processes.  One of the 
goals of WG 20 is to facilitate analyses of climate 
effects on marine ecosystems and ecosystem 
feedbacks to climate by, for example, computing an 
ensemble of the IPCC model projections for the North 
Pacific and making these projections available to 
other PICES groups such as CFAME.  The analyses 
could provide forecasts of regional parameters (such 
as sea surface temperature, sea ice cover, and river 
discharge) relevant to ecosystem processes identified 
within CFAME’s conceptual models. 
 
Summary of presentations 
 
Thirteen talks were presented by CFAME and WG 20 
members from Canada, Japan, Korea and the United 
States.  Presentations were organized by the three 
ecosystems that CFAME has focused on.  For each 
ecosystem a brief overview was presented by a 
CFAME member, providing a summary of the key 
processes that define the seasonal or temporal 
variability in physical parameters.  In addition, each 
presentation quickly introduced some of the key 
species in the lower and higher trophic levels of each 
system.   
 
CFAME members presented the conceptual models 
that they have developed for the mechanisms linking 
physical processes to population dynamics.  
Following these presentations, WG 20 members 
presented results of recent climate and oceanographic 
modelling efforts relevant to each of the three 
ecosystems.  To wrap up the information portion of 
the workshop, a presentation on synthesis, and 
summary of the key climate and oceanographic 
factors required for ecosystem projections given 
climate change, was made, followed by a presentation 
on the uncertainties in climate model ensemble 
projections.   
 
Discussion on the first day highlighted the need for 
CFAME to define geographic regions (e.g., spawning 
areas, zone within an ecosystem) and to provide the 
important physical parameters that affect population 
dynamics (e.g., stratification in the California Current 
System).  Despite the broad definitions used in the 
ecosystem conceptual models, key processes were 
identified for each ecosystem.  For the California 
Current System, temperature and its spatial variability, 
stratification, transition timing to upwelling, 
upwelling intensity, and eddies/meanders in the 
alongshore current.  Characteristics of upwelling 
could be represented by upwelling favourable winds.  
Characteristics of currents will be a difficult feature to 
provide from existing climate/ocean modelling efforts 
because of their coarse resolution.  In the 
Kuroshio/Oyashio System, key physical processes 
included temperature and its spatial variability, 
location of the southern branch of the Oyashio, 
location of the Kuroshio and its eddies/meanders.  In 
addition, a key predator (Japanese common squid) is 
impacted by temperature and salinity (i.e., 
pycnocline) in the East China Sea.  High resolution 
climate models have been developed for the 
Kuroshio/Oyashio System and these parameters, 
including characteristics in the Kuroshio (i.e., extent 
of meanders), could be forecasted.  The East China 
Sea is not well represented by climate models, mainly 
because of the dominant influence of freshwater input.

 Key processes identified for the Yellow Sea/East 
China Sea system included temperature and salinity.  
On the second day of the workshop CFAME and WG 
20 met separately to discuss the previous days’ 
discussion and to formulate workplans, and the 
outcomes are reported in the annual reports of each 
group.

2008 Report of Working Group 20 on 
Evaluations of Climate Change Predictions 
 
 
The Working Group on Evaluations of Climate Change Projections (hereafter WG 20) held its third meeting 
from 14:00–15:30 hours on October 25, 2008.  After introductory formalities to members and observers  
(WG 20 Endnote 1) were conducted by Co-Chairmen, Drs. Michael G. Foreman and Yasuhiro Yamanaka, the 
draft agenda was reviewed and adopted without changes, and Dr. Enrique Curchitser kindly agreed to serve as 
rapporteur (WG 20 Endnote 2). 
 
 
AGENDA ITEMS 3 AND 4 
Discussion of action items arising from a workshop with CFAME, and update on Terms of Reference 
 
The meeting began with a recap of the WG Terms of Reference (WG 20 Endnote 3) and an assessment of what 
had been achieved thus far. In light of the presentations by Drs. James Overland/Muyin Wang, James Christian, 
Emanuele Di Lorenzo, and Curchitser, Foreman and Yamanaka, at the workshop on “Climate scenarios for 
ecosystem modeling” (W4), it was felt that with the exception of items 4, 5, and 7, considerable progress had 
been made in all objectives.  
 
With regard to the collaboration with CFAME (Climate Forcing and Marine Ecosystem Response), whose 
tenure as a Task Team ended at this PICES meeting, Dr. Foreman briefly described the assignments/homework 
arising from the CFAME inter-sessional workshop on “Linking and visualizing climate-forcing mechanisms and 
marine ecosystem changes: A comparative approach” held April 15–17, 2008 in Hawaii and the Task Team’s 
goal of completing their final report by year end.  With regard to CFAME’s subproject on the California Current 
Ecosystem, Dr. Foreman stated that a recent email from CFAME member, Dr. Vera Agostini, requested 
information on projected changes to the stratification, temperature, river discharge, currents (e.g., undercurrent), 
eddies/meanders, winds (in relation to turbulence, upwelling, deep mixing), tidal mixing for (if possible), the 
northern, central, and southern subregions of the system.  Though it was generally agreed one or more regional 
climate models with sufficiently high resolution would be needed to provide these projected changes with some 
degree of confidence, at present these models do not exist.  Nevertheless, an intermediate step that should yield 
sufficiently accurate estimates for these variables would be the statistical downscaling of global climate model 
values that has been described in PICES workshops and sessions by Wang/Overland/Bond and 
Pal/Merryfield/Morrison/Foreman.  It was further agreed that the two variables for which it would be most 
difficult to provide change estimates would be the undercurrent (its underlying dynamics and variability are still 
not fully understood) and eddies/meanders (though it might be possible to estimate these changes by running 
existing regional models with higher heat fluxes, this could not be done in the time frame needed by CFAME).  It 
was resolved that Drs. Foreman, Overland, and Wang would do their best to provide the information that Dr. 
Agostini needed.  For the other two CFAME ecosystems, Dr. Yamanaka agreed that he would work with Dr. 
Sanae Chiba in providing the necessary information for the Kuroshio/Oyashio system while Dr. Young-Shil 
Kang would work with Dr. Jae-Bong Lee in providing the necessary information for the Yellow and East China 
Seas system. 
 
  
AGENDA ITEM 5   
FUTURE Implementation Plan 
 
Following a brief summary of the latest draft of the FUTURE Implementation Plan, a lively discussion followed 
on the roles of WG 20 and a possible follow-up working group.  Though WG 20 was scheduled to complete its 
tenure at the 2009 PICES Annual Meeting, it was felt that the downscaling requirements of the FIS/POC 
WG 20 Annual Reports  Appendix 5 
138 PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
proposed new Working Group on “Forecasting Climate Change Impacts on Fish and Shellfish” should justify 
asking POC and Science Board for a one year extension.  After that, it was felt that a new working group whose 
mandate would be to investigate the predictability of internannual to decadal variability might be warranted.  
Toward that end, it was decided that Dr. Di Lorenzo would work with Drs. Overland and Foreman in developing 
a proposal for a topic session along those lines for the next PICES Annual Meeting. (See WG 20 Endnote 4 for 
the final proposal. Note that at the Science Board meeting on November 1, this proposed Topic Session was 
switched to a workshop to be scheduled before the main PICES-2009 Annual Meeting.)  The success of that 
session would determine whether or not POC should proceed in creating the new working group. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEMS  6, 7, 8   
Final report, future workshops/meetings, items with financial implications 
 
Other issues discussed are as follows: 
1. Though extending WG 20 for another year forestalls planning the final report, it was agreed that we should 
be thinking of how that report should be structured.  It is hoped that all WG 20 members could provide 
summaries of their work relevant to the Terms of Reference. 
2. Even with an extension of WG 20’s lifetime, the development, testing, and evaluation of regional climate 
models will go beyond the tenure of WG 20. So a new home needs to be found for this activity – perhaps 
within one of the new FUTURE Task Teams. 
3. An informal WG 20 progress report meeting will be scheduled for those members attending the GLOBEC 
Open Science Meeting in Victoria, Canada in June 2009.  
4. A new zooplankton working group (Working Group (WG 23) on Comparative Ecology of Krill in Coastal 
and Oceanic Waters around the Pacific Rim) might also be asking for climate change estimates relevant to 
their research.  In order to respond to this request and perhaps others like it in the future, it might be possible 
to create an archive of downscaled results on some web server.  
5. It was agreed that WG 20/POC would support Dr. Anne Hollowed’s proposal for the creation of a new 
Working Group on “Forecasting Climate Change Impacts on Fish and Shellfish”. See WG 20 Endnote 5 for 
the background and Terms of Reference. 
6. It was also agreed that WG20/POC needs to continue emphasizing the fact that the physics cannot be 
assumed done in FUTURE activities.  Work needs to continue in better understanding the physical dynamics 
(e.g., interannual to decadal variability) relevant to ecosystems.

WG 20 Endnote 4 
Proposal for a 1-day Topic Session for PICES-2009 on 
“Exploring the predictability and mechanisms of Pacific low frequency variability beyond interannual 
timescales” [later changed to a workshop] 
 
Introductory lecture  
M. Foreman (POC) – “Overview of current understanding of Pacific Ocean climate variability” 
 
Understanding the dynamics that control climate variability in the Pacific basin is essential for exploring the 
degree of predictability of the ocean–atmosphere and sea–ice climate systems of the North Pacific.  The goal of 
this session is to improve the conceptual and quantitative frameworks used by the PICES community to interpret 
low-frequency climate variability in the Pacific basin, ranging from interannual to multi-decadal timescales.  We 
WG 20 Annual Reports  Appendix 5 
140 PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
invite contributions on a broad range of topics including (1) studies that link regional to basin scale dynamics, 
(2) investigations of “regime shift”, specifically  the extent to which sharp transitions in the climate system are 
predictable and connected with low-frequency variations in the ocean–atmosphere and sea–ice systems, (3) 
studies that separate the stochastic and deterministic components of low-frequency climate fluctuations, (4) 
analysis of long-term observations collected in regional environments across the Pacific, specifically 
their relationship to large-scale climate processes as opposed to local scale dynamics,  
(5) climate change and how it may impact the statistics of Pacific climate (e.g., frequency of “regime shifts”) 
and (6) more generally, studies that propose new mechanisms underlying low-frequency Pacific climate 
variability. 
 
Sponsor:  POC 
 
Convenors:  Emanuele Di Lorenzo (U.S.A.), Shoshiro Minobe (Japan)

WG 20 Endnote 5 
Proposal for a new PICES/ICES Working Group on  
Forecasting Climate Change Impacts on Fish and Shellfish (WG-FCCIFS) 
 
Proposed Parent Committees  
ICES approved the formation of WG-FCCIFS as a permanent working group.  FIS will serve as the parent 
committee for WG-FCCIFS with support from POC.  The activities of WG-FCCIFS may be integrated into the 
PICES FUTURE program as a task team.  WG-FCCIFS will report to the ICES Climate Change Steering Group, 
ICES Oceanography Committee, and the PICES FIS and POC Committees.

Rationale 
The work of WG-FCCIFS is essential to ensure that ICES and PICES will be able to provide guidance on the 
potential impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems and the response of commercial fish and shellfish 
resources to these changes. 
 
The work done within ICES and PICES on climate change and fisheries has been diverse and has included:  
a) guidance on methods for selection of  IPCC models under different emission scenarios for use in projections; 
b) techniques for downscaling IPCC model outputs to local regions, c) development of coupled ecosystem 
models for use in evaluating climate-induced shifts in environmental  conditions, d) literature documenting 
relationships between climate forcing and marine fish and shellfish distribution and production, and e) stock 
assessment techniques for evaluating management strategies to mitigate the impacts of change.  A challenge 
facing ICES and PICES is the need to integrate all of this research to provide stakeholders with quantitative 
estimates of the potential impact of climate change on marine life throughout the world.  This challenge calls for 
the establishment of an interdisciplinary research team composed of experts from around the world who will 
focus attention on the development of common and standardized frameworks for forecasting climate change 
impacts on marine life, with particular emphasis on commercially important fish and shellfish.  ICES and PICES 
should act now to ensure that our research communities develop the capibilities to provide quantitative 
contributions to the next IPCC reports and to provide guidance for management under climate change scenarios.  
 
Several case studies will be identified by the Steering Group based on their potential for contributing to 
methodological development and the opportunity for comparison of marine species and community responses to 
climate forcing in different ecosystems.  Members of the Working Group will be responsible for encouraging the 
development of regional interdisciplinary teams responsible for the production of forecasts.   Members of the 
Working Group will provide guidance to the regional teams by providing a framework for the development of 
the forecasts and communication of new advances in analytical tools.  The culmination of the Working Group’s 
effort will be presentation and discussion of results at an inter-sessional meeting and publication of results in a 
peer reviewed journal by 2011.  The timing for the publication is critical because the future IPCC AR5 report is 
slated for release in 2013 and the IPCC only allows references to published papers. 
 
Proposed Terms of Reference 
 
We recommend that WGFCCIFS is established to promote and coordinate research on the potential impacts 
of climate change on marine fish and shellfish around the world.  
The Working Group will: 
1. Promote research on climate change impacts on fish and shellfish by scientists in ICES and PICES 
member nations through coordinated communication, exchange of methodology, and organization of 
meetings to provide a venue for discussion and publication of results.  
2. Develop frameworks and methodologies for forecasting the impacts of climate change on the growth, 
distribution and abundance of marine life with particular emphasis on commercial fish and shellfish; 
3. Review the results of designated case studies to test methods; 
4. Hold an inter-sessional symposium in early 2010 where scientists can present, discuss and publish 
forecasts of climate change impacts on the world’s commercial fish and shellfish resources; 
5. Establish techniques for estimating and communicating uncertainty in forecasts; 
6. Evaluate strategies for research and management under climate change scenarios, given the limitations 
of our forecasts; 
7. Produce publications that could be considered for the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change in 2013; 
8. Publish a final report summarizing work. 
 
WG 20 Annual Reports  Appendix 5 
142 PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
The Working Group will utilize web technology to hold several virtual Working Group meetings.  They will 
hold an inter-sessional Working Group meeting on June 21, 2009 one day prior to the GLOBEC Open Science 
meeting in Victoria, Canada.  At that meeting members will review the results of designated case studies and 
discuss a symposium for 2010. WG-FCCIFS will report by September 2009 for the attention of the ICES 
Climate Change Steering Group, ICES Oceanography Committee, and the PICES FIS and POC Committees. 
WG-FCCIFS will provide several case studies that will contribute to the PICES FUTURE program.   
 
Working Group members will seek widened participation for this group, including contact with relevant 
academic and inter-governmental organizations such as fisheries managers, the North Pacific Anadromous Fish 
Commission, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, and FAO for the symposium in 2010.

Background  
 
Members of the Climate Forcing and Marine Ecosystem Task Team (CFAME), the Working Group on 
Evaluations of Climate Change Projections (WG 20), and the FIS Committee presented the results of their 
research on developing and applying the output of regional and global climate scenarios to ecosystem and fish 
stock forecasts. These groups have been developing conceptual and empirical models of the mechanisms that 
link climate variation to the dynamics of marine ecosystems and their commercially important species. Their 
work has focused on comparisons among a diversity of North Pacific ecosystems with differing dominant 
physical processes. WG 20 is developing higher resolution regional coupled atmosphere–ocean models forced 
by IPCC global or regional models to provide forecasts of regional parameters (such as SST, sea ice cover, and 
river discharge) that are relevant to ecosystem processes. This workshop provided an opportunity to discuss the 
results, present them to the PICES community, and describe their potential for the FUTURE Program.

2009 Report of Working Group 20 on 
Evaluations of Climate Change Predictions 
 
 
A Working Group 20 meeting was held in Jeju, Korea on October 25, 2009 from 14:00–18:00 hours. After 
introductory formalities by the Co-Chairmen, Drs. Michael Foreman (Canada) and Yasuhiro Yamanaki (Japan), 
and Dr. James Christian (Canada) agreeing to act as rapporteur, the meeting of participants (WG 20 Endnote 1) 
began according to the agenda (WG 20 Endnote 2) with a recap of the Terms of Reference (WG 20 Endnote 3).  
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 3 
Updates on work related to Terms of Reference 
 
Dr. Foreman stated that the CFAME final report was nearing completion and had received input from WG 20 
members Yasuhiro Yamanaka, Emanuele Di Lorenzo, Muyin Wang, Michael Foreman and Dr. Wang’s 
collaborators, James Overland and Nicholas Bond. The report will include chapters, each on the California 
Current, Kuroshio/Oyashio, and Yellow/East China Seas ecosystems. It was also noted that WG 20’s request for 
a one-year extension of its lifetime to collaborate with the new PICES/ICES Working Group on Forecasting 
Climate Change Impacts on Fish and Shellfish (WG-FCCIFS) was endorsed by Science Board.  
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 4 
Update on FUTURE and its new Advisory Panels 
 
A discussion of FUTURE was moved to the top of the agenda, and Dr. Foreman gave a brief introduction to them 
and discussed outstanding issues about their structure and function. He gave a brief summary of the final version 
of the FUTURE Implementation Plan and the roles of its three new Advisory Panels. As Dr. Lorenzo was named 
a member of COVE (Advisory Panel on Climate, Ocean Variaibility, and Ecosystems) and POC members Drs. 
Steven Bograd, Shin-ichi Ito, Vyacheslav Labonov and Zhanggui Wang were named to AICE (Advisory Panel 
on Anthropogenic Influences on Coastal Ecosystems) and SOFE (Advisory Panel on Status, Outlooks, Forecasts 
and Engagement), it was felt that physical/geochemical oceanographic and climate issues would be well 
represented in FUTURE. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 3, CONTINUED 
Updates on work related to Terms of Reference 
 
Brief updates on research progress relevant to the Terms of Reference were given by Drs. Elena Ustinova, 
Vadim Navrotsky, Enrique Curchitser, and Yamanaka, Christian, Lorenzo and Foreman. Dr. Muyin Wang had 
given an update of her work the preceding day in Workshop 8 on “Exploring the predictability and mechanisms 
of Pacific low frequency variability beyond inter-annual time scales”. It was felt that these summaries 
demonstrated good progress against the first four Terms of Reference.  
 
Dr. Foreman outlined the status of collaborations of WG 20 with WG-FCCIFS. They included his being named a 
Working Group member and his co-chairing (with Dr. Jason Holt of the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, 
Liverpool, UK) the Theme Session “Downscaling variables from global models” at the WG-FCCIFS workshop 
[later changed to an International Symposium] on “Climate change Effects on Fish and Fisheries: Forecasting 
impacts, assessing ecosystem responses, and evaluating management strategies” planned for Sendai, Japan in 
April 2010.  Dr. Muyin Wang has agreed to give an invited presentation in this session. Given the relevance of 
both this session and another entitled “Contemporary and next generation climate and oceanographic models, 
WG 20 Annual Reports  Appendix 5 
146 PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
technical advances and new approaches” to the WG 20 objectives, other Working Group members were 
encouraged to attend the Sendai workshop. An informal Working Group meeting might be convened there if 
there are enough members present. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 5 
WG 20 final report 
 
Given that WG 20 will end after PICES-2010, discussions on the structure and content of its final report were 
initiated. The following rough outline of possible chapters was put forward:  
1. Introduction, TOR, overview of progress and relevance to FUTURE, 
2. Contributions to CFAME and WG-FCCIFS, 
3. Wang/Overland/Bond: statistical downscaling in NEP, PDO representation, 
4. Curchitser: dynamical downscaling, 
5. Di Lorenzo and Miller: NPGO and ENSO representations and projections in GCMs, … 
6. Foreman et al.: BC statistical and dynamical downscaling, 
7. Yamanaka et al.: Kuroshio/Oyashio dynamical downscaling and ecosystem modeling, 
8. Korean work? 
9. Chinese work: Fan Wang will summarize various national efforts, 
10. Russian work: Elena Ustinova and Vadim Navrotsky will contribute with help from Yury Zuenko,  
11. Recommendations for FUTURE work. 
 
Dr. Foreman agreed to send out emails in 1–2 months requesting more complete outlines of respective chapters 
from individual members. Though this report need not be finished by PICES-2010, it was agreed that there was 
no desire to continue much beyond that date. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEMS 6 AND 7 
Future WG 20 workshops/meetings 
 
It was decided that WG 20 would propose a workshop entitled “PICES Working Group on Evaluations of 
Climate Change (WG 20): Progress and FUTURE” for PICES-2010. No invited speakers would be requested 
and presentations and discussions would concentrate on:  
   progress related to the WG 20 Terms of Reference, 
   status of, and future work on, the final report,  
   follow-up activities that conform to FUTURE objectives and needs. 
 
The possibility of submitting at least one oral presentation summarizing WG 20 activities to the Science Board 
Symposium at PICES-2010 was also discussed, and will be finalized via email as the deadline abstract 
submissions for that meeting comes closer. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 8 
Other business 
 
No other business was discussed and the meeting was adjourned at about 17:30 hours.

2010 Report of Working Group 20 on 
Evaluations of Climate Change Predictions 
 
 
The fifth and final meeting of Working Group on Evaluations of Climate Change Projections (WG 20) was held 
from 14:00–17:00 hours, October 24, 2010 in Portland, U.S.A.  The Co-Chairman, Dr. Michael Foreman, called 
the meeting to order and, after introductory formalities, WG 20 member, Dr. Muyin Wang, kindly agreed to act 
as the rapporteur.  
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 3 
Review of Working Group Terms of Reference and summary of accomplishments 
 
Dr. Foreman began the meeting with a recap of the WG 20 Terms of Reference (TORs) and a summary of 
activities addressing each one (WG 20 Endnote 3).  It was generally felt that significant progress had been made 
with the IPCC GCM evaluations (#1), the development of regional climate models (RCMs) (#3), collaboration 
with other PICES expert groups like CFAME and WG 25 (#2), and convening PICES and international 
workshops/sessions (#5). 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 4 
WG 20 final report 
 
As WG 20 completed its tenure at this PICES meeting, a primary discussion point was the structure and content 
of the final report.  It was agreed that each of the Working Group member chapters should summarize work 
accomplished versus the Terms of Reference and be 10–20 pages long.  With an expectation of contributions 
from all Working Group members, the following chapter outline was put forward:  
1) Acknowledgments, Abbreviations and Acronyms, Executive Summary, 
2) Introduction: Background, Terms of Reference, Membership, Outline,  
3) Wang, Overland, Bond: GCM downscaling procedures and examples,  
4) Di Lorenzo, Miller: regional climate modeling and covariability in North Pacific,  
5) Foreman and colleagues: RCM development for BC shelf waters, 
6) Christian: GCM carbon cycle development,  
7) Curchitser, Hermann: RCM development for the NE Pacific and Bering Sea and two-way coupling of this 
RCM into the  NCAR GCM,  
8) Ustinova, Zuenko: evaluation of climatic variability in Far Eastern Seas,  
9) Navrotsky: interactions between climate and ecosystems, 
10) Yamanaka, Hasumi, and colleagues: ecosystem projections for the Kuorshio/Oyashio system,  
11) Jang, Pang, Yeh,  Oh and colleagues: GCM projections of changes to mixed layer depth,  
12) Qiao, Wang, Wu and colleagues: Chinese contributions,  
13) Summary and recommendations. 
 
It was emphasized that the final report is considered “grey literature” and will not be formally reviewed.  As such, 
individual chapters should only give highlights of work that is either planned for publication, or has already been 
published.  For specific PICES formatting requirements authors were referred to http://www.pices.int/ 
publications/scientific_reports.  The PICES Secretariat will technically edit the report and although MS Word 
files are preferred, other formats are acceptable (e.g., LaTeX equations will be converted to MathType).  Tables 
can either be in Word or Excel (no images of tables) and though the figures can be in any one of the common 
various formats (e.g., eps, tiff, jpg), they should be good quality and use greyscale if colour is not necessary.  
Chapters should be sent to Dr. Foreman by December 31, 2010, with earlier submissions preferred. 
Appendix 5 WG 20 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 40 151 
As PICES Science Board and Governing Council are particularly interested in the recommendations from this 
Working Group, Dr. Foreman presented four possibilities (WG 20 Endnote 4) that will hopefully be expanded 
and extended in the final report. Draft Terms of Reference for a new working group on “North Pacific Climate 
Variability and Change” that was proposed by Drs. Emanuele Di Lorenzo and Shoshiro Minobe were also 
presented and discussed along with the four recommendations.  Several comments were made asking for 
clarification of terminology (e.g., conceptual mechanistic model), time scales, and scope, and these were 
recorded so they could be passed on to Drs. Di Lorenzo and Minobe. Possible membership (e.g., the need to 
bring in new people) was also discussed.  
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 5 
Update on FUTURE and its Advisory Panels 
 
Dr. Hiroaki Saito, Chairman of the FUTURE Advisory Panel on Climate, Ocean Variaibility, and Ecosystems 
(COVE-AP), gave a brief summary of its meeting on October 22.  COVE-AP fully supports the proposed new 
“climate” working group and is proposing both another new working group on “Ecosystem Responses to 
Multiple Stressors “ and a workshop on “Indicators of status and change within North Pacific marine 
ecosystems: A FUTURE workshop” to occur just before or after the inter-sessional Science Board meeting in 
April 2011.   
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 6 
Other business 
 
Dr. Anne Hollowed gave a brief summary of recent activities of the joint PICES/ICES WG on Forecasting 
Climate Change Impacts on Fish and Shellfish.  Though this Working Group ends in 2011, its high productivity 
has spawned discussion on how it will continue within each the ICES and PICES frameworks. Regardless of 
how the Group is re-structured, there will be an ongoing need for IPCC GCM and RCM projections so Dr. 
Hollowed was supportive of WG 20 recommendations on how that might be done. 
 
No other business was discussed and the meeting was adjourned at 17:00.  Dr. Foreman thanked all members for 
their contributions over the four-year tenure of the Working Group.

   Proceeding. 
 
 
WG 20 Endnote 4 
Draft recommendations for the final report 
 
1. Continue evaluating IPCC GCM (and RCM) results.  
a. James Overland, Muyin Wang, Chan Joo Jang (and others?) plan evaluations of new AR5 outputs when 
they are available (winter 2010–11?); 
b. WG 25 (joint PICES/ICES Working Group on Forecasting Climate Change Impacts on Fish and 
Shellfish) will be interested in these forecasts; 
c. The RCM community is hoping to have a chapter in AR5; 
d. Besides continuing Japanese GCM/ecosystem model studies (Yamanaka and colleagues), several North 
Pacific RCMs are under development that are being, or could be, coupled to ecosystem models (e.g., 
Curchitser, Hermann, Rose et al.); 
e. This activity may not warrant a new Working Group but the work should be part of COVE-AP and/or 
SOFE-AP. 
 
2. Continue analyses of North Pacific inter-annual to inter-decadal variability. This would be an extension of 
the PICES-2009 workshop on “Exploring the predictability and mechanisms of Pacific low frequency 
variability beyond inter-annual time scales” (W8) convened by Emanuele Di Lorenzo and Shoshiro 
Minobe. 
   A new working group, under POC and with COVE-AP’s support, has been proposed (WG 20 Endnote 5 
has the draft Terms of Reference); 
   IPCC-AR5 will include decadal predictions. Unlike GCM predictions that should only be evaluated 
statistically, these decadal predictions should be directly comparable with subsequent observations. An 
analysis of these predictions could be part of SOFE. 
WG 20 Annual Reports  Appendix 5 
154 PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
 
3. Establish live-access servers or ftp sites to archive and provide easy access to results from RCMs, analogous 
to the PCMDI archive for IPCC GCM results.  
   This would address WG 20 TOR #4, something that was not adequately accomplished during the tenure 
of the Working Group; 
   It would also provide fisheries scientists (e.g., WG-FCCIFS) with climate change variables on much 
finer spatial scales than can be resolved with the GCMs.  
   This could be a possible activity for the COVE or SOFE Advisory Panels and TCODE.  
 
4. Provide and regularly update lists of links to GCM/RCM sites like NARCCAP (North American regional 
climate model results, http://www.narccap.ucar.edu/) and to relevant publications like the “Guide to Best 
Practices on the Use of Climate Models” (Overland et al.). 
 
 
WG 20 Endnote 5 
Proposal for a new Working Group on “North Pacific Climate Variability and Change” 
 
Motivation 
 
The need to develop essential mechanistic understandings of North Pacific climate variability and change that 
can better guide the formulation of process-based hypotheses underlying the links between ecosystem dynamics 
and physical climate. 
 
Draft Terms of Reference 
 
1. Develop conceptual mechanistic models or frameworks of North Pacific climate variability and change that 
can be readily used by ecosystem scientists to explore hypotheses of the links between ecosystem dynamics 
and physical climate. 
2. Summarize the current understanding of mechanisms of Pacific climate variability, and evaluate the 
strengths of the underlying hypotheses with supporting evidence. 
3. Coordinate, in conjunction with ecosystem scientists, the development and implementation of process-based 
models to hindcast the variability of available long-term biological time series. 
4. Provide improved metrics to test the dynamics of the IPCC models. 
5. Understand and fill the gaps between what the physical models can currently produce and what ecosystem 
scientists suggest are important physical forcing factors required for predicting species and ecosystem 
responses to climate change. 
6. Maintain linkages with, and summarize the results from National and International programs/projects such 
as CLIVAR, IMBER, US CAMEO, ESSAS, Japanese Hot Spot in the Climate System, POMAL, CREAMS 
EAST-I, POBEX, and others. 
7. Convene workshops and sessions to evaluate and compare results. 
8. Publish a final report summarizing results.

Summary of Business Meeting and Discussions 
 
After introductory formalities and Muyin Wang kindly agreeing to act as the rapporteur, Mike began the meeting 
began with a recap of the WG Terms of Reference (TORs) and his personal summary (Appendix 1) of activities 
addressing each one.  It was generally felt that significant progress had been made with the IPCC GCM 
evaluations (#1), the development of regional climate models (RCMs) (#3), collaboration with other PICES 
groups like CFAME and WG25 (#2), and convening PICES and international workshops/sessions (#5).  
 
As WG20 completed its tenure at this PICES meeting, a primary discussion point was the structure and content 
of the final report.  It was agreed that each of the WG member chapters should summarize work accomplished 
versus the TORs and be 10-20 pages long.  With an expectation of contributions from all members, the following 
chapter outline was put forward:  
1) Acknowledgments, Abbreviations & Acronyms, Executive Summary 
2) Introduction: background, Terms of Reference, membership, outline  
3) Wang, Overland, Bond: GCM downscaling procedures & examples  
4) Di Lorenzo, Miller: regional climate modeling & covariability in North Pacific  
5) Foreman & colleagues: RCM development for BC shelf waters 
6) Christian: GCM carbon cycle development  
7) Curchitser, Hermann: RCM development for the NE Pacific and Bering Sea & two-way coupling of this

11) Jang, Pang, Yeh,  Oh & colleagues: GCM projections of changes to mixed layer depth  
12) Qiao, Wang, Wu & colleagues: Chinese contributions  
13) Summary and recommendations 
 
It was emphasized that the final report is considered “grey literature” and will not be formally reviewed.  As such, 
individual chapters should only give highlights of work that is either planned for publication, or has already been 
published.  For specific PICES formatting requirements authors were referred to http://www.pices.int/ 
publications/scientific_reports.  Rosalie Rutka from the PICES Secretariat will be the technical editor and 
although she prefers MS Word files, she will accept other formats (e.g., LaTEX equations will be converted to 
MathType).  Tables can either be in Word or Excel (no images of tables) and though the figures can be in any one 
of the common various formats (e.g., eps, tiff, jpg), they should be good quality and use greyscale if colour is not 
necessary.  Tables and figures can be put at the end of each chapter and Rosalie will fit them into the text later.  
Chapters should be sent to Mike by December 31, 2010, with earlier submissions preferred. 
 
As PICES Science Board and Governing Council are particularly interested in the recommendations from this 
WG, Mike presented four possibilities (Appendix 2) that will hopefully be expanded and extended in the final 
report.  Draft TORs for a new working group on “North Pacific Climate Variability and Change” that was 
proposed by Emanuele Di Lorenzo and Shoshiro Minobe were also presented and discussed along with the four 
recommendations.  Several comments were made asking for clarification of terminology (e.g., conceptual 
mechanistic model), time scales, and scope, and these were recorded so they could be passed on to Di Lorenzo 
and Minobe. Possible membership (e.g., the need to bring in new people) was also discussed. 
 
Hiroaki Saito, chair of the COVE Advisory Panel, gave a brief summary of the COVE meeting on October 22.  
COVE fully supports the proposed new “climate” working group and is proposing both another new working

2008 PICES Workshop on “Climate Scenarios for Ecosystem Modeling (II)” 
 
by Michael Foreman, Anne Hollowed and Suam Kim 
 
A key component of FUTURE (an acronym for Forecasting 
and Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of 
North Pacific Marine Ecosystems), the new over-arching 
science program within PICES, is understanding and 
communicating the impacts of climate change on North 
Pacific marine ecosystems.  Whereas FUTURE’s 
predecessor, the Climate Change and Carrying Capacity 
(CCCC) Program, focussed primarily on past climate 
change effects, this new program will have a stronger 
emphasis on future changes, and thus rely heavily on the 
global climate model projections described in the Fourth 
Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC).  Toward that end, the CFAME 
(Climate Forcing and Marine Ecosystems) Task Team of 
the CCCC Program has laid some of the groundwork for 
FUTURE by collaborating with the Working Group on 
Evaluations of Climate Change Projections (WG 20) in 
analysing downscaled atmospheric and physical 
oceanographic projected changes from a suite of global 
climate models to determine their impact on states of three 
North Pacific ecosystems:  the California Current System, 
the Kuroshio/Oyashio System, and the Yellow and East 
China Seas System (see PICES Press, Vol. 16, No. 2, for the 
summary of their April 2008 workshop).  A joint workshop 
of these two groups on “Climate scenarios for ecosystem 
modeling (I)” took place at the 2007 PICES Annual Meeting 
in Victoria, Canada, and a follow-up  
1.5-day workshop, jointly organized by CFAME, WG 20, 
and a prospective new ICES/PICES Working Group on 
Forecasting Climate Change Impacts on Fish and Shellfish, 
was held at the 2008 PICES Annual Meeting in Dalian, 
China.  This article summarizes some highlights of this 
second workshop that was co-convened by Michael 
Foreman, Anne Hollowed, Suam Kim, and Gordon 
McFarlane. 
 
The workshop opened with an invited presentation by 
Thomas Okey (Pew Fellow in Marine Conservation) on the 
challenge of forecasting changes to marine biota and 
fisheries in the year 2035.  He summarized discussions from, 
and collaborations established at, a workshop preceding the 
conference on “The Effects of climate change on the world’s 
oceans” held in Gijón, Spain, in May 2008, and outlined the 
motivation for the new ICES/PICES Working Group that is 
being led by Anne Hollowed.  The next two speakers, James 
Overland and Young-Shil Kang gave updates of their work 
relevant to the CFAME terms of reference.  In particular, 
Jim stressed that among the 22 global climate models that he 
and his colleagues Muyin Wang and Nicholas Bond 
investigated, no one model was uniformly best in capturing 
all the important oceanic features in the North Pacific.  
However, he did show a “wall of fame/shame” table rating 
model relative performance and indicated a group of 
approximately six models that gave generally acceptable 
results over a standard evaluation period, and that should be 
used in future ensemble estimates of climate change in the 
North Pacific. 
 
Five out of the next six presentations were progress updates 
given by WG 20 members.  Yasuhiro Yamanaka described 
recent results received with the COCO-NEMURO coupled 
biophysical climate model for the Kuroshio/Oyashio region.  
Emanuele Di Lorenzo gave a preview of his subsequent 
award-winning Science Board presentation describing his 
North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) analysis of 
variability in North Pacific sea surface elevations and its 
links with ENSO signals.  Jim Christian described the 
development of a carbon cycle component within the next 
generation of the Canadian Global Climate Model.  Enrique 
Curchitser showed preliminary results of improved 
upwelling arising from embedding and fully coupling his 
10-km regional ROMS model for the Northeast Pacific 
within the NCAR global climate model.  Michael Foreman 
described wind downscaling results and new regional 
climate and ecosystem model initiatives in Canadian waters.  
Within these updates, Qigeng Zhao described his simulations 
of acidification in the Pacific. 
 
The remaining presentations provided information on 
efforts to forecast the implications of climate change on fish 
and shellfish in the North Pacific.  Anne Hollowed discussed 
a framework for making forecasts by using statistical 
methods to select credible IPCC models and extract their 
expected forcing.  This forcing could then be incorporated 
into statistical age-structured models to project impacts on 
commercial fish populations.  Gordon Kruse presented a 
qualitative method that could be used to forecast climate 
change impacts on red king crab stocks in the Eastern 
Bering Sea.  Suam Kim talked about the response of Korean 
chub mackerel populations to climate forcing, showing that 
salinity is significantly correlated to year-class strength and 
suggesting that shifts in transport may play a key role in 
recruitment variability of this stock.  Michio Kishi examined 
the role of climate variability on the growth of salmon, 
pollock and squid in the northwestern Pacific using a 
bio-energetic model.  Preliminary results of this study 
suggest that chum salmon may not survive in waters off 
Hokkaido in 2100.  Richard Beamish gave two talks on the 
impact of climate change on salmon stocks in British 
Columbia.  His first talk showed that poor marine survivial 
of chinook salmon in the Strait of Georgia appears to be 
related to reduced growth resulting from a declining 
carrying capacity in the area, while his second talk 
compared two sockeye salmon runs that exhibited different 
population trends.  As was the case in the first talk, the 
different trends appear to be related to the spatial 
distribution of food and the behaviour of juvenile salmon. 
The final half-day of the workshop was devoted to 
discussions on the proposed new ICES/PICES Working 
Group on Forecasting Climate Change Impacts on Fish and 
Shellfish (WGFCCIFS).  Manuel Barange, one of the ICES 
Co-Chairs for this group, provided an overview of 
PICES Press Articles  Appendix 6 
162 PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
ICES-community interest in this effort and noted that ICES 
had already approved the formation of WGFCCIFS and its 
terms of reference.  Individuals from PICES member 
countries identified several research programs that would 
contribute to the activities of the working group. 
 
The participants discussed the rationale for start and end 
dates of 2035 and 2100, respectively, for the investigations.  
The former date was selected because it is the projected time 
when the climate change signal will begin to overwhelm the 
interannual and interdecadal signal in the North Pacific.  The 
end date was selected because after it, forecasts will be 
heavily dependent on which particular IPCC emission 
scenario is chosen for predicting the rate of greenhouse gas 
build-up in the atmosphere.  Mikhail Stepanenko noted that 
managers are most interested in forecasting future fish 
populations over short time horizons, and therefore, we 
should not ignore any efforts to also improve short-term 
projections.  A clear linkage between short-term and 
long-term projections will be model validation activities.  
By examining the performance of projections in the 
short-term, analysts should be able to quantify expected 
inaccuracies associated with the long-term projections. 
 
Different frameworks for delivering IPCC model output 
were discussed.  It was agreed that the ideal framework 
would be one where oceanographers and climatologists 
from each member nation work with their biologists and 
modellers to develop relevant forecasts.  However, it was 
noted that James Overland, Muyin Wang, and Nicholas 
Bond from the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory 
would be willing to assist various groups, when necessary 
and as time permits. 
 
The participants had a lively discussion of the topic of 
communicating uncertainty.  George Sugihara mentioned 
that forecasting is a complicated science and that there is a 
variety of analytical tools that have been developed for the 
business community which could be applied here.  Jake Rice 
noted that the issue of communicating uncertainty requires that 
we identify the stakeholders who might be interested in our 
forecasts.  It was noted that the advice of PICES and ICES 
on the future status of marine resources around the world 
could be used to address the following issues: 
   global food security; 
   implications on northward shifts in stocks on managing 
domestic fisheries, including shifts in the locations of 
fishes (e.g., sardines, hake) and rights-based 
(communities and businesses) solutions; 
   new fisheries in the north (especially for Canada, 
Russia and U.S.A.); 
   assessing species and populations at risk (what are 
appropriate recovery targets for species in a changing 
world?). 
 
Patricio Bernal (Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission of UNESCO) indicated that his organization 
would be very interested in this new ICES/PICES effort.  It 
was agreed that potential collaborations with IOC, FAO and 
other organizations would be investigated.

2009 Mechanism of North Pacific Low Frequency Variability Workshop 
 
by Emanuele Di Lorenzo and Shoshiro Minobe 
 
A 2-day workshop on “Exploring the predictability and 
mechanisms of Pacific low frequency variability beyond 
inter-annual time scales”, co-convened by the authors of 
this article, was held on October 24–25 at the 2009 PICES 
Annual Meeting in Jeju, Korea.  The workshop was well 
attended with over 25 contributors, and was divided into 
four sections: (1) Ocean and atmosphere variability in the 
North Pacific, (2) Coupling between tropics and 
extra-tropics, (3) North Pacific western boundary 
variability and feedbacks, and (4) Discussion and synthesis.  
Thanks to the support of PICES, we were able to 
accommodate eight invited speakers, who covered each of 
the focus areas: Sumant Nigam (University of Maryland, 
U.S.A.), Curtis Deutsch (University of California Los 
Angeles, U.S.A.), Lixin Wu (Open University of China) 
Michael Alexander (NOAA, U.S.A.), Dan Vimont 
(University of Wisconsin-Madison, U.S.A.), Bo Qiu 
(University of Hawaii, U.S.A.), Masami Nonaka and 
Bunmei Taguchi (Earth Simulator, JAMSTEC, Japan).  The 
overall goal of this workshop was to review our current 
understanding of the dynamics underlying low-frequency 
fluctuations of the Pacific and to isolate potential 
mechanisms and linkages (e.g., tropics/ extra-tropics 
coupling, ocean/atmosphere coupling/feedbacks in the 
western boundary current system) that can provide the basis 
for low-frequency predictability. 
 
Ocean and atmosphere variability in the North Pacific 
(Invited speakers: S. Nigam and C. Deutsch) 
 
The first section of the workshop was devoted to review of 
our current understanding of the modes of ocean 
low-frequency variability that act on timescales beyond 
interannual, and of the relationship between modes of 
variability in the ocean and atmosphere (S. Nigam).  Several 
talks focused on the importance of the first two dominant 
modes of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface 
height (SSH) variability of the North Pacific, namely the 
Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and North Pacific Gyre 
Oscillation (NPGO).  Strong climate transitions of the North 
Pacific are likely better understood by considering both 
modes.  For example, while the PDO has played a dominant 
role in the 1976–77 climate transition, the NPGO dominated 
the 1988–89 climate transition (S. Yeh).  These transitions are 
a prominent signal in marine ecosystems and in 
biogeochemical tracers (e.g., oxygen), although the 
dynamics connecting physics to ecosystems and 
biogeochemistry was not explored and to large extent 
remains unclear (C. Deutsch).  While it was suggested that 
part of the Pacific low-frequency variability may be forced 
by the Lunar and Solar cycle (e.g., PDO, S. McKinnell), it 
was generally recognized that the dynamics of the oceanic 
modes can be understood in the context of their atmospheric 
 
drivers.  While the PDO responds to variability of the 
Aleutian Low (AL) (S. Nigam), the NPGO appears to be 
forced by the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) (E. Di 
Lorenzo), which emerges as the second dominant pattern of 
North Pacific sea level pressure after the AL.  The AL and 
NPO are the surface expressions of atmospheric variability 
associated with the Pacific North American (PNA) and 
Western Pacific (WP) teleconnection patterns.  Statistical 
analysis of SST (S. Nigam) also isolated a Pan-Pacific 
decadal variability mode that is related to the Atlantic 
Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), which needs further 
investigation in terms of ecosystem impacts and may provide 
means to synchronize ecosystem variations between oceanic 
basins (e.g., Atlantic and Pacific).  Understanding how modes 
of ocean and atmospheric variability such as the 
PNA/AL/PDO and WP/NPO/NPGO respond to anthropogenic 
climate forcing was also discussed and remains an 
outstanding issue (M. Wang). 
 
 
 
Coupling between tropics and extra-tropics 
(Invited speakers: L. Wu, M. Alexander and D. Vimont) 
 
This section of the workshop explored the mechanisms and 
dynamics by which tropics and extra-tropics interact.  While 
we have known for a while that tropical activity associated 
with the canonical El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
excites atmospheric variability of the PNA/AL/PDO, recent 
studies (D. Vimont, M. Alexander) also suggest that the 
extra-tropical variability of the NPO/NPGO – the second 
dominant pattern of atmospheric/ocean variability in the 
North Pacific – can affect ENSO.  Coupled ocean/atmosphere 
model experiments shown by D. Vimont suggest that the 
NPO variability in the North Pacific excites a mode of 
variability that is independent of ENSO.  This mode – 
referred to as the Meridional Mode because of its 
north-south spatial and temporal structure – generates warm 
temperature anomalies in the central tropical Pacific that 
lead to an ENSO response about one year later.  Support for 
this hypothesis was presented using coupled climate models 
(M. Alexander).  In addition to the NPO/NPGO to ENSO 
connection, other studies that used partial coupling of a 
coupled climate model suggested that the PNA/ AL/PDO 
North Pacific expression may exert an even stronger control 
on tropical variability (L. Wu). 
 
There was also discussion on a new flavor of a 
non-canonical ENSO characterized by a central Pacific 
warming (CPW) pattern which drives a teleconnection to the 
North Pacific that affects the variability of the NPO/NPGO 
(E. Di Lorenzo).  This link may provide a positive feedback 
between tropics and extra-tropics. 
PICES Press Articles  Appendix 6 
164 PICES Scientific Report No. 40 
 
 
 
Further understanding and quantifying of these coupling 
dynamics is necessary to establish the physical basis for 
exploring the predictability of North Pacific climate. 
 
North Pacific western boundary variability and feedbacks 
(Invited speakers: B. Qiu, M. Nonaka and B. Taguchi) 
 
In this section we discussed how the large-scale modes of 
North Pacific variability (e.g., PDO and NPGO) have a 
significant delayed impact on the low-frequency dynamics 
of the North Pacific western boundary, and explored 
mechanisms by which the western boundary SST variability 
can feed back onto large-scale atmospheric variability.  The 
two dominant modes of oceanic variability in the 
Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE) region were viewed in 
terms of a lagged response to large-scale atmospheric 
variability of the AL/PDO and NPO/NPGO, respectively.  
Satellite SSH and SST analyses show that the first dominant 
mode in the KOE, which corresponds to a change in mean 
location of the jet’s axis and a switch between a stable and 
unstable state (B. Qiu), is forced by the arrival of Rossby 
waves excited by the AL/PDO in the central North Pacific.  
From long-term in situ observations, the second mode of the 
KOE corresponding to an acceleration of the jet forced by 
the NPO/NPGO was reconstructed (S. Minobe).  Effects of 
the NPO/NPGO modes were also reported in regional seas 
(e.g., Okhotsk Sea, E. Ustinova).  In addition, multi-decadal 
eddy-resolving ocean simulations elucidated some important 
non-linear dynamics and feedbacks in the KOE.  It was 
shown that upon the arrival of these Rossby waves in the 
KOE region, adjustment of Kuroshio Extension’s 
recirculation gyres organizes the incoming signals into 
narrow oceanic frontal zones, causing low-frequency 
variability in SST and surface heat fluxes (SHF), with large 
amplitudes along the fronts (M. Nonaka).  The differential 
SHF across the oceanic fronts can potentially force the 
overlying atmosphere on a large scale.  This feedback was 
investigated using atmospheric regional model experiments 
(B. Taguchi) that confirmed the importance of the near-surface 
air–sea temperature gradients in shaping the seasonal 
(winter–spring) mean atmospheric storm-track along the 
oceanic frontal zones, as observed.  A more direct coupling 
via atmospheric Ekman pumping was also suggested as a 
key process to couple the ocean mesoscale and atmospheric 
circulation in the KOE (N. Schneider). 
 
It has been shown that there is predictability with a 
lead-time of several years associated with the propagation 
and arrival of the Rossby waves excited by the AL and NPO.  
If air–sea feedbacks from the KOE SST to the large-scale 
atmosphere are confirmed, they may provide an alternative 
pathway to self-sustained modes of variability in the 
extra-tropics, which could enhance even more the 
predictability of North Pacific decadal climate. 
 
Discussion and synthesis 
(Coordinators: A. Miller, S. Minobe and E. Di Lorenzo) 
 
The discussion section was opened with an attempt to 
summarize our current understanding of the Pacific climate 
dynamics and the linkages among the various modes of 
ocean and atmospheric variability, including the connections 
between tropics and extra-tropics.  The schematic above 
(from E. Di Lorenzo) depicts a synthesis of the hypothesis 
and dynamics discussed during the workshop.  In this 
schematic there are two sets of dominant dynamics in the 
Pacific: the ENSO/AL/PDO (red path) and CPW/NPO/NPGO 
(blue path).  These are physically linked and connected 
through the ENSO system in the tropics.  Both the PDO and 
NPGO are to first order the oceanic expressions of the 
atmospheric forcing associated with the AL and NPO 
variability, respectively, and therefore, integrate the 
low-frequency variations of the canonical and 
non-canonical ENSO through atmospheric teleconnections 
from ENSO→AL →PDO and CPW→NPO→NPGO.  In 
addition to the tropics driving the extra-tropical variability, a 
link also exists from the extra-tropics back to the tropics 
through the NPO →CPW/ENSO (D. Vimont, M. Alexander), 
Appendix 6 PICES Press Articles 
PICES Scientific Report No. 40 165 
giving rise to the potential for a feedback between tropics 
and extra-tropics along the path NPO →CPW →NPO (E. Di 
Lorenzo).  A link from the PDO to the tropics has also been 
suggested (L. Wu) but the relationship to the ENSO system 
is still being investigated. 
 
While the AL and NPO atmospheric variability have 
maximum loading in the central and eastern North Pacific, 
their forcing also drives prominent decadal variations in the 
western North Pacific.  Specifically, the oceanic adjustment 
to the SSHa anomalies of the AL/PDO and NPO/NPGO 
radiate Rossby waves that propagate into the western 
boundary.  The arrival of the AL/PDO SSHa is associated 
with changes in the axis of the KOE, while the arrival of the 
NPO/NPGO SSHa modulates variations in the speed of the 
KOE.  These two modes of KOE variability – the KOE 
Meridional Mode (shift in axis) and the KOE Zonal Mode 
(change in speed) – have been shown to capture the first two 
dominant modes of variability in the KOE.  In the KOE, the 
expression of these modes is characterized by frontal scale 
features in SST and SHF that may feedback onto the modes 
of atmospheric variability (e.g., AL, NPO) (M. Nonaka, B. 
Taguchi, N. Schneider). 
The discussion section emphasized the need to develop 
quantitative approaches to evaluate the role of these 
ocean/atmosphere modes, especially the more recently 
recognized CPW/NPO/NPGO system, in explaining North 
Pacific (SST, circulation), sea ice, climate over land and 
marine ecosystem indices.  PICES provides an ideal 
opportunity to use such quantitative models with long-term 
observations in the North Pacific from Canada, China, Japan, 
Korea, Russia, and the United States of America.

PICES PUBLICATIONS 
The North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES) was established by an international convention 
in 1992 to promote international cooperative research efforts to solve key scientific problems in the North 
Pacific Ocean. 
PICES regularly publishes various types of general, scientific, and technical information in the following 
publications: 
PICES ANNUAL REPORTS – are major 
products of PICES Annual Meetings which 
document the administrative and scientific activities 
of the Organization, and its formal decisions, by 
calendar year.   
PICES SCIENTIFIC REPORTS – include 
proceedings of PICES workshops, final reports of 
PICES expert groups, data reports and planning 
reports.
PICES TECHNICAL REPORTS – are on-line 
reports published on data/monitoring activities that 
require frequent updates. 
SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS – are products that 
are destined for general or specific audiences.
JOURNAL SPECIAL ISSUES – are peer-
reviewed publications resulting from symposia 
and Annual Meeting scientific sessions and 
workshops that are published in conjunction with 
commercial scientific journals.   
BOOKS – are peer-reviewed, journal-quality 
publications of broad interest. 
PICES PRESS – is a semi-annual newsletter 
providing timely updates on the state of the 
ocean/climate in the North Pacific, with highlights of 
current research and associated activities of PICES. 
ABSTRACT BOOKS – are prepared for PICES 
Annual Meetings and symposia (co-)organized by 
PICES.

Front cover figure 
Two examples of member activities applied to Working Group 20’s first and third terms of reference: 
 i) to analyse and evaluate climate change projections for the North Pacific and its marginal seas based on 
predictions from the latest global and regional models submitted to the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change for their 4th Assessment Report, and iii) to facilitate the development of higher-resolution 
regional ocean and coupled atmosphere-ocean models that are forced by, and take their boundary conditions 
from, IPCC global or regional models.  Top: A regional ecosystem model version of COCO-NEMURO 
applied to the lower trophic level marine ecosystem simulating the timing of maximum chlorophyll 
concentration (dark blue is January, red is June) in the spring bloom in the Kuroshio-Oyashio system. 
(See Yamanaka et al. for more details.)  Bottom: A Northeast Pacific regional climate model nested in the 
CCSM global climate model relative to the CCSM model showing sea surface temperature (dark blue is  
–3.0°C and red is +3.0°) and wind anomalies (maximum is approximately 1.5 m/s) in August. (See 
Curchitser et al. for more details.)
