Foreword 
 
“The workshop brought together international scientists with an interest in the Okhotsk Sea and adjacent 
areas to review what is known, to learn of recent investigations and new knowledge, and to discuss the 
most important elements that should be included in the North Pacific Ecosystem Status Report.” 
…Dr. Lev Bocharov (June 4, 2003) 
 
This publication is the third in a series of PICES Scientific Reports on The Okhotsk Sea and Adjacent 
Areas.  The themes covered by the third workshop were broadly based, for the purpose of integrating 
observations of physics, chemistry, and biology in the region.  The first two sessions on climate 
variations, and physical and chemical processes were convened by Dr. Vyacheslav Lobanov (Pacific 
Oceanological Institute, Russia), Dr. Yutaka Nagata (Japan), Prof. Steven Riser (University of 
Washington, U.S.A.) and Prof. Sei-ichi Saitoh (Hokkaido University, Japan).  The session on biological 
variability was convened by Dr. Elena Dulepova (TINRO-Center, Russia).  Dr. Vladimir Radchenko 
(SakhNIRO, Russia), Dr. Keiichi Mito (Hokkaido National Fisheries Research Institute, Japan) and Dr. 
Tatyana Belan (FERHRI, Russia) chaired a session on anthropogenic effects and marine ecosystem 
response that included a variety of issues related to fisheries and to oil/gas exploration in East Sakhalin. 
 
A novel element in the programme was an attempt to synthesize the major findings in a ½-day discussion 
session at the end of the presentations.  The results of this workshop contributed significantly to the 
PICES North Pacific Ecosystem Status Report;  a report that addresses questions such as: ·What is the 
current status of the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem and why?· How does it differ from historical observations?· 
How does this compare with other regions in the North Pacific?  
 
The organizers of the workshop in Vladivostok, especially the hosts at TINRO-Center, offered the 
participants with a memorable scientific and social environment for collaboration.

Introduction 
A study of linear trends and cyclical variations of 
climate is very interesting because it gives some 
possibility to forecast changes of weather and 
marine environment.  This problem is one of the 
most important in the fishery science, but it is 
rather difficult because of the complicated 
character of interannual temperature variations.  
Recent studies of air temperature over the Okhotsk 
Sea and adjacent areas were guided mainly by the 
detection of linear trends of centennial and semi-
centennial series (Kim et al. 1997; Pestereva and 
Pushkina 1998; Ponomarev et al. 1999, 2000, 
2001, 2002; Shevchenko and Kato 1999; 
Varlamov et al. 1997, 1998).  The main features of 
long-lived tendencies have been described for this 
region, however in our opinion, oscillations with 
periods from 2 till 50 years have not been 
investigated sufficiently.  Usage of the wavelet 
method of the analysis of temperature time series 
reveals new information about the contribution of 
various temporal scales to total variability and its 
temporal change.  We suppose that the interannual 
variations of temperature could be regarded as 
modulation of seasonal fluctuations. 
 
Data  
Air temperature data are the longest time series of 
relatively homogeneous and regular information.  
For the analysis we used monthly mean air 
temperature data at coastal meteorological stations 
that were measured by Russian, Japanese and 
Korean hydro-meteorological agencies.  The 
stations used for the analysis are located around 
the Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 1).  Air temperature data 
were obtained from the NASA GISS web page 
(http://www.giss.nasa.gov/data/update/gistemp/station_data).  
The periods of observations differed among 
stations (Table 1) and unfortunately some of the 
Russian ones, including such interesting sites as 
Simushir and Icha, were abandonned in the late 
1990s, which limited our analysis.

oscillations.  The seasonal signal is strongly 
manifested in air temperature in the area of the 
Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 2), so its modulations cause 
some difficultness for spectral analysis of 
observational data.  For example, calculations of 
annual mean values are incorrect for future 
spectral analysis because of aliasing that can 
produce incorrect peaks.  Probably this effect is 
one of the causes of inadequate results in a number 
of investigations of the climate problem.  
 
To solve this problem, we analyzed summer mean 
(June-July-August) and winter mean (December-
January-February) values separately as highest and 
lowest envelope of initial monthly mean data (Fig. 
2).  Additionally, we estimated the amplitudes of 
the annual harmonics that were calculated using 
least square method for each year.  This parameter 
describes the modulation of seasonal oscillations 
most exactly.  
 
Another cause of difficulties may be the unstable 
character of climate variations.  So usually we 
obtain the wide, illegible peaks in the spectra of air 
and water temperature.  It means that estimations 
of cycles are not sufficiently exact for weather 
forecasting.  
The usual spectral methods give incorrect results 
for periods of more than 25 years with typical 
duration of observations 50-80 years.  To solve 
this problem, we used the method of spectral-time 
analysis (Dzievonski et al. 1969) that is used to 
study changes in time of spectral amplitudes for 
different frequencies.  This method is very close to 
the wavelet analysis.

The method reveals the temporal variability of 
spectral characteristics of a signal and achieves the 
most precise resolution in the low frequency 
bands.  Briefly, the idea of this method is as 
follows.  We choose a time series of air tempera-
ture (or another parameter) and the highest ( ω
1
) 
and the lowest ( ω
N
) frequencies corresponding to 
our interest and duration of observations.  Also we 
choose a number (N) of frequencies from ω
1
 to ω
N
 
using a logarithmic scale.  Fourier transformation 
was applied to each frequency;  smoothing with 
the use of Gaussian filter is carried out in the 
frequency area.  Inverse Fourier transformation is 
carried out for each frequency too, in this way we 
are obtaining the changing in the time of spectral 
amplitudes for different frequencies, the results are 
represented in spectral-time diagrams that look 
similar to wavelet diagrams. 
 
All air temperature series were analyzed in the 
same way.  At first, linear trends for annual mean, 
summer mean and winter mean values for each 
station were calculated using standard procedure 
of Microsoft Excel.  Amplitudes of annual 
harmonics for each year were estimated and 
spectral-time diagrams for all parameters were 
constructed.

same type were normalized to the same spectral 
maximum that usually equals 1˚C for summer and 
annual amplitude and 2˚C for winter because of 
more intensive oscillations in this season.  The 
color palette was scaled on a logarithmic scale 
from maximum (red color) with step 1 decibel.  
The blue color corresponds to the very weak 
oscillations; red, orange and yellow colors 
correspond to significant oscillations.  
 
Results and discussion  
Time series of annual mean, summer mean, winter 
mean temperatures, and linear trends for two of 
stations (Nemuro and Okhotsk) have a positive 
tendency in all cases.  However, it is less 
expressed in the southern part of the Okhotsk Sea, 
relatively weak warming in winter about 1° С per 
125 years and almost no trend in summer.  In the 
northern part we observed significant winter 
warming (1° С per 40 years) and weaker in 
summer time (about 1° С per 60 years).  We found 
the similar picture in the “continental” stations 
(Ayan, Nikolaevsk-na-Amure, Magadan, 
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky) and the “marine” 
stations (Abasiri, Akita, Izuhara, Simushir, 
Nikolskoe, St.Paul).  Probably this difference is 
caused by different influences of Pacific Ocean 
and Asia continent where warming processes are 
well-expressed, especially in a winter time.  
“Winter cooling” was observed at the Korf station 
that is located somewhat north of the other 
stations.  Probably, there are other atmospheric 
processes in this area.  
 
Spectral-time diagrams for Okhotsk 
meteorological station are shown in Figure 3.  In 
winter, high-frequency oscillations with 2-3 year 
periods are strongly manifested in the air 
temperature.  These oscillations are not stable, 
resembling stochastic processes and therefore they 
have a negative effect for weather forecasting.  We 
can see a very interesting effect of frequency 
deviation in the 6-10 year period band.  In the first 
25-year interval relatively low-frequency 
oscillations with periods 8-10 years were 
observed; in the next 25-year interval these 
periods changed to 5-7 years.  
 
Relatively stable, well-expressed oscillations with 
period about 18-19 years can be seen in Figure 3.  
In contrast to high-frequency fluctuations, these 
oscillations may be a good base for the climate 
forecasting in winter. 
 
In summer we can see the same picture of unstable 
high-frequency oscillations in the 2-10 year period 
band.  There are also clear stable peaks at about 
22-25 and 50 year periods.  The great difference 
between low-frequency fluctuations in winter and 
summer is a very surprising result.  It means that 
the changes of air temperature in warm and cold 
seasons have been influenced by different 
processes in atmosphere.  
 
On the spectral-time diagram for Nemuro air 
temperatures in summer (Fig. 4), high spectral 
powers are evident at periods of about 55 and 25 
years, which is similar to the Okhotsk station.  
Oscillations with 15-17 year periods are evident in 
the beginning and at the end of the time series, and 
10-12 year periods appear in the middle of the 
series.  The oscillations with periods of about 5-6 
and 2-3 years are the most intensive and unstable.

In winter, the spectral-time diagram lacks 
variations with 25 and 50 year periods, and 
oscillations with 6-8 and 2-3 year periods 
dominate.  Oscillations with 12-15 year periods 
appear midway through the time series.  Station 
Abashiri (near Nemuro) has a major likeness with 
Nemuro, but it is not identical.  Station Icha had a 
similar pattern with 5-7- year oscillations. 
Now we shall consider stations that are located 
some distance from the Okhotsk Sea.  At St. Paul 
(Bering Sea), interannual variability of air 
temperature has a very different character.  There 
are 11-year oscillations, and at high frequencies, 
the spectrum decreases slowly with peaks poorly 
separated.  In the 5-11 year frequency band, the 
structure of variations of frequency of cruption

outbursts is similar to the majority of stations in 
the Okhotsk Sea.  In winter air temperature 
oscillations are stronger than in summer. 
 
In the Korea Strait area (station Izuhara), the 
character of oscillations also differs strongly from 
those in the Okhotsk Sea.  The low-frequency 
oscillations with periods more than 10 years are 
negligible in winter and summer.  High-frequency 
fluctuations with 2-5 year periods dominate in this 
area.  So, the spectral-time diagrams are 
characterized by non-stationary dynamic modes.  
The modes have a rather ranked character.  They 
appear through the whole length of a series.  As a 
rule, it is low-frequency oscillations.  The 18-20 
year rhythm prevails in them and 50 year 
oscillations are observed on the western coast of 
the Okhotsk Sea.  It is noteworthy, that they also 
contribute to the formation Okhotsk Sea ice cover.   
 
Conclusions 
On the spectral-time diagram for temperature in 
summer, the bands of high spectral power are 
strongly expressed at periods of about 50 and 25 
years, which testifies to the permanent presence of 
these oscillations.  The oscillations with a 15-17 
year period are marked in the beginning and in the 
end of the time series, and 10-12 year periods in 
the middle of the series.  The oscillations with 
periods about 5-6 and 2-3 years are the most 
intensive. 
 
The spectral-time diagram is different for winter.  
Low-frequency variations with 25 and 50 year 
periods are absent, and the oscillations with 6-8 
and 2-3 year periods dominate.  Oscillations with 
12-15 year periods appear in the middle of the 
time series. 
 
Thus the variations of climate in the northwestern 
Pacific in winter and summer seasons are formed 
by essentially different factors.  As a result, 
different cyclic components were revealed by 
wavelet analysis.

The influence of atmospheric processes on the water circulation off the west 
Kamchatka coast

The basic elements of the water circulation off 
the west coast of Kamchatka are (Fig. 1b):  
• West Kamchatka Current is a northward 
stream that is initiated by the penetration of 
Pacific waters through the northern Kuril 
straits; 
• The Compensatory Current is a southward 
current that reaches from the Khayryuzovo 
shoals along the Kamchatka coast up to 
Bolsheretsk; 
• Mesoscale features of various nature. 
These characteristics were derived from the 
usual representations (Luchin 1982, Luchin 
1987, Figurkin 1997, Chernhyavskij, 1981). 
 
Considering the position and orientation of the 
West Kamchatka and Compensatory currents, it 
is possible to assume the presence of connection 
between these streams.  However, analysis of their 
volume transports in springs of 1983-1995 (Figurkin 
1997) has shown that intensive development of the 
Compensatory Current was observed both in years 
with small and large volume transports in the West 
Kamchatka Current.  Hence, a direct connection 
between these two streams is absent.  It is necessary 
to note that the location of the calculated sections 
varied such that, to some degree, subjectivity may 
have affected the results.  
 
In the present work, the authors have considered the 
interrannual variability of characteristics of West 
Kamchatka and Compensatory currents and have 
tried to connect it with the variability of synoptic 
atmospheric processes above the Okhotsk Sea.

The oceanographic information was obtained 
from 18 TINRO-TURNIF complex surveys off 
the West Kamchatka coast in the spring period 
of 1983-2002 (Table 1).  The analysis of maps 
of the dynamic topography constructed from the 
results of all surveys has shown that, in most 
cases, the West Kamchatka and Compensatory 
currents are observed on 53-56°N.  Therefore, 
for comparison among years, an east/west 
section along 55°N was selected.  
 
Geostrophic currents speeds relative to 500 dbar 
and the water transport in a layer of 0-500 m 
were calculated.  As measurements of 
temperature and salinity were often executed up 
to 200 m, current speeds and volume transport 
were also calculated to a 200 dbar surface.  
Characteristics of the atmospheric circulation 
above the Okhotsk Sea basin were estimated by 
methods developed by one of authors especially 
for Okhotsk Sea (Glebova 1999, Glebova 2002).  
The identification of synoptic types was made 
using ten-day average maps of surface pressure 
for the period 1980-2002.  The main criterion 
used to identify types was the position of the 
main pressure formations (cyclones and 
anticyclones) relative to the Okhotsk Sea.  In 
total, seven types of atmospheric processes were 
identified. 
 
From the same 10-day synoptic maps, values of 
the Kats index (Kats 1960) were calculated for 
the area 40-60°N, 130-160°E, which provided an 
estimate of the interannual variability of 
intensity and orientation of meridional 
movement of air masses above the Okhotsk Sea 
basin.  The anomalies of the Kats index relative 
to their average for the period of 1980-2002 
were used for the analysis. 
The analysis of the location of currents along the 
55°N section indicates that during all periods of 
observation the midstream of the West Kamchatka 
Current was situated between 153°30’ – 154°30’E 
(Fig. 1c), while the Compensatory Current was 
situated to the east of 154°30’E (Fig. 1).  Both 
streams can be traced to the bottom.  
 
The ocean depth in the area of the West Kamchatka 
Current is about 500 m, and about 200 m or less in 
the area of the Compensatory Current.  So 500 and 
200 m depths are logical choices as reference levels 
for calculating dynamical characteristics.  However, 
as was shown earlier (Table 1), surveys with 
observations up to 500 m were carried out, basically, 
in second half of the period (56 percent of cases).   
 
The volume transports of the West Kamchatka 
Current relative to 200 and 500 dbar reference levels 
are given in Table 2.  From this, it is possible to 
conclude that the basic volume transports of the 
West Kamchatka Current occur in the top 200-meter 
layer (the ratio between Q200 and Q500 varies from 
0.71 up to 0.82).  An exception occurred in 2002 
when this ratio was 0.39.  
 
Comparison of the volume transports of the West 
Kamchatka Current relative to 200 and to 500 dbar 
indicates a close correlation (r= 0.97 at significant 
factor of correlation 0.87 with confidence level 
99.9%).  Hence, the tendencies of interannual 
variability of volume transports of the West-
Kamchatka Current for a 500-meter thickness can be 
inferred from calculations of volume transports 
relative to a 200 dbar level.  Using this approach 
almost doubles the number of observations.

In Table 3, the variability of volume transports of 
the West Kamchatka and Compensatory currents 
relative to 200 dbar along 55°N is presented.  Note 
that the volume transport of the West Kamchatka 
Current has varied from 1.24 Sv in 1995 down to 
0.23 Sv in 1991.  The maximal volume transport 
of the Compensatory Current was 0.09 Sv and this 
occurred in 1988.  This current was not observed 
along 55°N in 1989, 1990, 1992, 1995-1997 and 
2002. 
 
Several periods of direct or contrary dependencies 
between the volume transports of these currents 
were observed (Fig. 2).  Thus it may be to 
eliminate the periods of 1984-1990, 1993, 1999-
2000, when the increase or reduction of West-
Kamchatka current volume transport resulted the 
similar changing of the Compensatory Current 
volume transport.  In 1991-1992, 1995-1998, 2001 
there was recorded the contrary picture.

Fig. 2 Interannual variability of volume 
transports in the West Kamchatka and 
Compensatory currents along 55°N. 
 
As a working hypothesis, it was proposed that the 
interdependence of these currents were 
conditioned by the prevalence of certain types of 
synoptic atmospheric processes in the region. 
 
 
Fig. 3 Direct (a) and reverse (b) dependencies 
between volume transport of the West Kamchatka 
and Compensatory currents. 
 
During periods of small pressure gradients or 
when westward and northwestward forcing 
occurred, the West-Kamchatka Current flows 
along the Kamchatka coast, enters Shelikhov Bay 
and forms part of the clockwise circulation in the 
bay, leading to the formation of the Compensatory 
Current (Fig. 3a).  When eastward and 
northeastward predominate, transport in the main 
part of the West Kamchatka Current deviates to 
the west, taking part in the circulation along the 
northern Okhotsk Sea shelf.  Under these 
conditions, it does not penetrate into Shelihov Bay 
and does not influence the Compensatory Current.  
In years of increased intensity of the West 
Kamchatka Current, part of this current flows 
northward along the west coast of Kamchatka (in 
 11
the region where the Compensatory Current 
normally forms) causing cyclonic circulation in 
Shelikov Bay and preventing the formation of the 
Compensatory Current (Fig. 3b). 
 
To test the hypothesis, we constructed diagrams of 
interannual variability of the frequency of synoptic 
atmospheric patterns (Fig. 4).  As the character of 
currents mostly likely depends on the influence of 
wind driven transports during the long previous 
period, the data on total recurrence of identifiable 
typical synoptic situations during the entire 
previous year were used.  
 
 
Fig. 4 Interannual variability of frequency of 
types of the atmosphere synoptic patterns above 
the Okhotsk Sea:  (a) I+IV types (westward and 
weakened transfer);  (b) VI+VII types (mainly 
eastward transfer in the northern part of the 
Okhotsk  Sea;  (c) annual average anomaly of 
zonal index – I з. 
 
Synoptic patterns were summarized according to: 
a. The recurrence of the small gradient I type 
(with weak and unstable transport) and type 
IV causing the distribution above mostly water 
area of northwest and western winds.  
b. Wind transports of primarily eastward 
orientation which are connected mainly to 
types VI and VII.  Under type VI eastward 
transport dominates over the entire Okhotsk 
Sea basin, while under type VII, transport is 
influenced by cyclonic circulation, winds from 
the south above the West Kamchatka shelf and 
eastward over northern part of Sea of Okhotsk.  
 
As was noticed earlier, up to approximately 1992, 
the development of the West Kamchatka and 
Compensatory currents was uniform, their 
strengthening and weakening occurring 
simultaneously.  The analysis of diagrams 
indicates, that over this period, there was a gradual 
increase of the total amount of types I and IV 
(average frequency of these two types was about 
equal during 20 ten-day periods in the year).  The 
frequency of synoptic types VI and VII was low (6 
times in a year).  Thus the frequency of atmo-
sphere processes with westward and/or weakened 
transports exceeded the frequency of eastward 
direction of air mass transfer by more than three 
times.  The diagram of zonal Kats index anomalies 
(Fig. 4c) illustrates the trend and intensity of this 
atmosphere circulation quantitatively.  It is 
obvious that positive anomalies of the zonal Kats 
index predominated up to 1992.  This is related 
with a noticeable strengthening of westward 
transports in those years. 
 
After 1992 the atmospheric regime changed and 
the frequency of types I and IV decreased to an 
average of ≤16 10-day periods in a year.  The 
mean level of recurrence of types VI and VII 
increased up to eight 10-day periods (maximum of 
13 in 1996).  Thus, the change in proportions of 
synoptic processes was reflected in the formation 
of resulting transports.  The predominance of 
negative zonal Kats index anomalies during this 
period may indicate a weakening of westward 
circulation and even to possible changes in 
eastward transports.  
 
Therefore, it is quite logical to consider that those 
changes which are evident in the character of the 
correlation of the West Kamchatka and 
Compensatory currents, namely the existence of 
periods of synchronous and asynchronous changes 
in volume transports are closely connected to 
reorganizations in the atmosphere, especially with 
changes in the character of atmospheric circulation 
above the Okhotsk Sea. 
 
 12
It may also be possible to interpret why a positive 
correlation between both currents appeared in 
1999 and 2000 given the tendency for a negative 
correlation after 1993.  In those years, a change in 
the behavior of atmosphere processes (Fig. 4) 
occurred again.  The frequency of types I and IV 
increased, and the frequency of types VI and VII 
decreased sharply.  That change in the atmosphere 
regime was influence at once on the character of 
atmosphere circulation; the zonal Kats index 
anomalies were positive and achieved levels 
observed during the 1980s.  The strengthening of 
the westward transfers above the Okhotsk Sea did 
not persist, but it affected the character of water 
circulation in subsequent years.  In 1999 and 2000 
the volume transport trends for the West 
Kamchatka and Compensatory currents were 
synchronous.

Introduction 
Climate variability is a very important problem for 
people, hydrobiology and fishery, that is why so 
many researchers from different countries are 
studying it.  This problem is priority for 
SakhNIRO too.  Biologists of our institute usually 
need a forecast of abiotic conditions in the Sea of 
Okhotsk and adjacent of waters for two-three 
years.  The main question they are interested in is 
what will happen, for example in 2005; will it be 
“cold” or “warm”.  To answer this question, we 
need to study the cyclical fluctuations of climate 
because such fluctuations with trends of 
temperature are the basis for any climatic forecast. 
Also, we should understand the mechanisms of the 
formation of these cycles in order to be sure of our 
results.  Therefore determination of low-frequency 
SST cycles and their spatial extent in the North 
Pacific was a main goal of our work. 
 
Interannual changes of air and water temperature 
are very difficult subjects to analyze because 
interannual variability is manifested as a 
modulation of seasonal variations.  The seasonal 
signal is very strong with a well-expressed peak in 
the spectra of SST oscillation in the Okhotsk and 
Japan seas, so its modulation is a cause of some 
problems for SST data analysis.  The example of 
GDAAC SST data in the spots which are located 
in these basins are shown in Figure 1.  
 
To solve this problem, we analyzed the summer 
mean (July – August – September) and winter 
mean (January – February – March) SST series 
separately, although for the Okhotsk Sea, the 
winter SST data is not adequate because of ice 
cover, therefore we did not consider these results 
in the present work.  Also we analyzed the 
changes of amplitude of the annual harmonics that 
were calculated for each year separately using 
least square method for each spot in the North 
Pacific.  The annual harmonic is the main 
constituent of the seasonal signal, so year-to-year 
changes of the annual amplitude describe its low-
frequency modulation most exactly.  That is why 
we considered this parameter most carefully in the 
present work.

Data and method 
We used the 15-year (1982-1996) series of 
GDAAC monthly mean SST data in the northern 
part of Pacific that were averaged by 1° squares.  
We see two methods of analyzing these data sets.  
The first is to calculate spectra at each spot and to 
make maps of the spectral amplitudes for the 
periods represented by the main spectral peaks.

However we have not yet prepared the necessary 
software for such a large database.  Another way is 
use to EOF method to analyze the spatial structure 
of summer and winter mean SSTs and to use 
spectral-time analysis (one kind of wavelet 
method) to estimate main peaks in amplitudes of 
several EOF modes.  
 
Results and discussion 
The first modes of both winter and summer SSTs 
(Fig. 2) describe water temperature changes with 
latitude.  Some interesting properties of SST 
(relatively cold water off California and warmer 
water near Alaska) can be recognized.  The 
amplitude of this mode is almost exactly -1˚ (Fig. 
3) and its change with time is negligible. 
 
The distribution of the second mode (Fig. 2) is 
more interesting.  We see the opposite character of 
SST changes in equatorial zone (values are about 1

part of the Okhotsk Sea (-1.75 ~ -1.3).  The 
amplitude of this mode had changed from -1 up to 
2.5, and oscillations with period about 5 years area 
apparent in the spectral-time diagram (Fig. 4).  It 
is interesting that we did not obtain a decadal 
cycle from our analysis of summer SST data.

EOF modes of amplitude of annual harmonics. 
 
However, the most interesting results were 
obtained for amplitude of annual harmonic.  The  
 
spatial structures of two first modes are shown in 
Figure 5 and their amplitudes are shown in the 
Figure 6.  The values of the first mode are 
negative for almost all points in the northern part 
of  the North Pacific.  The amplitude of this mode 
is about –1, indicating that equatorial and tropical 
areas have relatively weak seasonal changes.  The 
opposite is evident in the Yellow and Japan seas.  
In the area of the Kuroshio and North Pacific 
currents, where the seasonal signal is very strong, 
the amplitude of the annual harmonic reaches 10-
12˚C (total changes are about 20-24˚C).  
 
We obtained a complex structure in the Sea of 
Okhotsk.  There are strong seasonal oscillations in 
the southwestern and northwestern parts of the sea, 
and weak ones near Kashevarov Bank, and in the 
central and northern parts of the Kuril Ridge.

maximum (red color) equals 0.1˚C for first and 2˚C for second mode, logarithmic scale color palette with 
step 1 decibel. 
 18
Areas of the Kuroshio and Tsushima Warm 
currents are strongly manifested in the structure of 
the second EOF mode (positive values).  Areas 
with negative values can be seen in the eastern 
part of the Bering Sea and in the Sea of Okhotsk, 
northeastward from Sakhalin Island.  
 
We used wavelet analysis to determine the 
interannual variability of first and second mode 
amplitudes.  Spectral-time diagrams are shown in 
Figure 7.  Only one peak with a period of about 5 
years is seen in the spectra of the first mode.  The 
amplitude of this five year cycle is relatively small 
(about 0.1°C), however for the southwestern part 
of the Okhotsk Sea it reaches 1°C, for Yellow Sea 
and western part of Japan Sea it reaches 1.2°C.  
 
A low frequency peak with a period of 13-14 years 
and some unstable high-frequency oscillations 
with periods of 2-4 years were determined in the 
spectra of second mode.  Probably, the period of 
observation is too short to determine low 
frequency oscillations exactly so our results are 
very limited, and we will develop our study using 
more complete SST data. 
 
Conclusion 
Modulation of SST seasonal oscillations in the 
northern Pacific was studied using EOF and 
wavelet analysis.  Well-expressed 5-year cycles 
were found in the summer SSTs and in the 
amplitude of the annual harmonic in the area of 
the Kuroshio and Tsushima Warm currents as well 
as in the western part of Okhotsk Sea.  
 
The 5-year cyclical fluctuation may be useful and 
effective for the forecast of abiotic conditions in 
the Okhotsk and Japan seas and adjacent waters of 
Pacific Ocean.  The more low frequency 
oscillations and their spatial scales were estimated 
inexactly because of the short period of 
observations.  More reliable results may be 
obtained by analysis of more complete data.

The impacts of ground hydrology on the high-
latitude oceans, such as melting glaciers and 
discharge from rivers in the oceans, can affect 
global climate by mediating the flow of low-
density, fresh water inflow that strengthens the 
ocean's stratification.  This suppresses the 
thermohaline circulation and also promotes sea-ice 
formation.  Our time series analysis based on sea-
ice and river-discharge data indicates that the 
effect of this fresh water on the sea-ice in the 
Okhotsk Sea, into which the second largest 
Siberian River, the Amur, discharges, is relatively 
unimportant.  Interannual variations in the ice 
extent are negatively correlated with the amount of 
discharge.  We find circumstantial evidence that 
the inflow of warmer river water tends to raise the 
sea surface temperature, and that it suppresses ice 
formation in the following winter.  This potential 
explanation for the negative correlation implies 
that sensible heat transported by large rivers in 
high latitudes should be reconsidered in studying 
global climate change.

Introduction 
The Kantakov and Shevchenko (2001) article “The 
analysis of residual currents in the La Peruse Strait 
associated with the level variation and wind 
effect” has attracted our attention because of an 
interpretation of a unique long-term experiment to 
measure currents in La Perouse Strait in 1999 
using mooring stations located just in the middle 
of the strait.  One interesting result, and an 
emphasis in the paper, was the observation of a 
change in the flow vectors that occurred twice, on 
March 6-7 and 21, which the authors explained as 
variability of the Soya Current that normally 
enters the Okhotsk Sea at the mooring station 
location.  One reason for what might have caused 
such turns was described by Kantakov and 
Shevchenko as the result of a storm and its 
accompanying east wind.  In the present work, we 
have decided to continue research in this direction 
in order to support or deny their viewpoint.

Shevchenko (2001), a refereed paper;  
2. Daily northern hemisphere sea level pressure 
mean field from NCAR taken from the 5° 
latitude by 5° longitude data set;  
3. Daily northern hemisphere surface U and V

4. Merged altimetric TOPEX/POSEIDON data 
set obtained from the NASA Physical 
Oceanography Distributed Active Archive 
Center at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/ 
California Institute of Technology.  
 
All the materials were picked up for a period from 
November till March 1999-2002, however with 
purposes of expanding the research period, the 
additional data for March for the period 1980-
2003 were used.  In total, 712 daily synoptic 
situations were studied. 
 
Results and discussion  
According to common viewpoints, the Soya 
Current in La Perouse Strait is generally deemed 
to have an east- and southeastward flow that is 
more expressed in the warm period of the year.  
Maximum of the flow velocity occurs in August-
September when its speed reaches 2-3 knots.  The 
velocity minimum occurs from December – 
February.  It is assumed that the Soya Current is 
driven be the sea level difference between the 
Japan and Okhotsk seas. 
 
Aiming to study anemobaric situations over La 
Perouse Strait area in those months when the Soya 
Current is poorly developed, we first chose all 
daily synoptic maps for a period from November 
to March during which current vector observations 
were available.  Figure 1 shows an example of 
current vector reversals in February-March 1999.  
These cases correspond to only two types of 
synoptic situations (Fig. 2): 
• sea level center of a deep cyclone settles down 
over Hokkaido Island and a high pressure area 
is located above the Okhotsk Sea.  In this case 
the significant meridional sea level pressure 
gradient zone stretches over the La Perouse 
Strait.  This zone causes strengthens east 
direction winds; 
• sea level center of deep cyclone is located 
southeastward of La Perouse Strait and the 
high pressure area is found toward the 
northwest.  Winds of a northeast direction 
predominate over the area under discussion. 
 
 22
Storm winds of east and northeast directions that 
are maintained for 1 to 3 days tend to favor the 
occurrence of barogradient currents which should 
prevail above the permanent ones from the Japan 
Sea.  Their consequence should be a storm surge 
observed at coastal stations in rows of sea level 
and sea surface temperature as well as in short-
term turn of vectors of the surface flow from 
general southeast direction to west and northwest, 
that will cause movement of water from the 
Okhotsk Sea.  However, wind forcing cannot be 
considered as the only cause of the turn of water 
flow.  As it is shown in Figure 3, changes of wind 
at the nearest grid point to La Perouse Strait do not 
fully confirm the current changes except on March 
15-17 and 18-22;  the direct correlation being 
absent on March 6-8.  That is why we suppose that 
not only storm winds from the east, but sea level 
pressure distributions affect the sea surface 
through baric gradients causing differences in 
level and as result, the reversal of the Soya 
Current.

Fig. 2 Anemobaric situations contributed to the Soya Current reversal in March 1999. 
 
Fig. 3 Re-analysed vectors of winds at point 45°N, 142.5°E. 
 
In Table 1, the dates of current reversals observed 
in Figure 1 are aligned with occurrences of strong 
easterly wind and baric center locations.  Of 16 
cases when the current changed, 14 cases (87%) 
correspond to east or northeast winds and in 12 
cases (75%), the centers of cyclones were located 
directly above Hokkaido Island.  It should be 
noted that the influence of the anemobaric effect is 
evident down to a depth of 45 m (second horizon 
of measurements) after a lag of about two days. 
Analysis shows that synoptic situations above La 
Perouse Strait area, when storm winds of east 
direction develop, are observed rather frequently.  
In all Marchs from 1980 to 2003, 74 cases were 
revealed, in which there could be a potential 
opportunity for Soya Current reversal due to the 
influence of eastern storm winds.

In March, for last 23 years, it is possible to 
identify three periods of increased probability of 
storm winds of easterly direction.  These are dates 
from March 3 to 8, 14-18 and 20-24.  In 31% of 
cases, the anemobaric situations that can cause 
strengthening of wind surges and promote Soya 
Current reversals are revealed on March 15-18 and 
24. 
 
Concluding remarks 
Joint analysis of synoptic and oceanographic 
situations confirms Kantakov and Shevchenko 
hypothesis that winds cause a reversal of the 
current vectors.  Hence, such situations in the La 
Perouse Strait area in winter can arise 
sporadically.  In the summer-fall period when the 
Soya Current is fully developed, its flow does not 
react to the anemobaric effect and reversed flow 
does not occur.  It should be noted that the 
influence of cyclones was observed at up to 45 m 
depth after a one to two day lag. 
 
Processes affecting the Soya Current extension in 
the La Perouse Strait area have a very complex 
character, with tidal influences and other 
disturbances like eddy formation.  Moreover, it is 
suggested that the reversed flow occurs during the 
winter period because the sea level difference 
between the Japan and Okhotsk seas is minimal.  
That is why it is not correct to assume that winds 
are the only cause of flow reversals.  The 
barometric pressure field only favors barogradient 
currents stretching into the Japan Sea during 
periods when the the permanent flow is weekly 
developed in winter.

This work was carried out within the framework of 
research of climatic changes along the Russian Far 
East coast.  The purpose of this work, in particular, 
is to understand the change of various 
meteorological parameters at the coast of the Far 
East, especially changes of the last decade.  The 
choice of points of observations was defined by 
the duration of observations in areas that are useful 
for studying changes and fluctuations of climate, 
and secondly, by the continuity of record, and 
thirdly, by the availability of the information on 
the Internet.  Five Far Eastern locations, located 
mainly in the coastal zone, were selected.  These 
included Magadan, Nikolaevsk-na-Amure, 
Poronaisk, the Sovetskaja Gavan, Rudnaja Pristan 
and Vladivostok.  The period of observations 
ranged from 1917 to 2002.  
 
To define dates of steady transitions of air 
temperature, downturns and increases with step-
type behavior 10° С from 0 up to -30° С were used 
the daily data inside the cold period.  Also the 
mode of duration of solar light and short-wave 
solar radiation was considered.  
 
For the cold period, the basic statistical 
characteristics of the monthly sums of duration of 
solar shine, total and direct solar radiation have 
been designed for horizontal and normal surfaces 
to a beam.  Also these characteristics paid off for 
dates and durations of the periods with a various 
level of temperatures.  Inertia of processes was 
investigated on the basis of various 
communications. 
 
From the analysis of average values and factors of 
variation of the specified characteristics it is 
possible to note the following.  The monthly sums 
of light exposure are minimal in December.  For 
all considered zones, the small share of a nucleus 
of winter in all the cold period is characteristic.  
Inertia of winter processes is well shown on all 
considered stations.  In particular the beginning of 
the cold period everywhere predetermines its 
duration and duration of the period with 
temperatures lower than 0°C and more -10°C.  
Duration of the period with the lowest 
temperatures is connected to the date of its 
beginning.  The greatest variability characterizes 
dates of transition of temperature increases. 
 
Dynamics of researched meteorological values in a 
long-term section have been appreciated with use 
of a linear trend, averaging of Afanasieva, and also 
with the help of the autocorrelation and spectral 
analysis. 
 
As any statistical size, factors of autocorrelation 
are subject to casual fluctuations.  Therefore tests 
of their significance were conducted.  Confidence 
intervals inside which the researched characteristic 
with probability of 95% did not differ from zero. 
 
It has been determined, that practically all 
researched parameters it is possible to count 
process of change casual, that is these lines 
statistically are homogeneous.  However on 95% a 
significance value some factors of correlation 
overstep the bounds of confidence area, but at 
more rigid confidence level (99%) all factors of 
autocorrelation do not differ from zero.  
 
Average of meteorological process received by 
method Афанасьева, reveal in researched lines 
middle-period (cycles of 1 rank) and long-period 
(cycles 2 ranks) fluctuations. 
 
Cycles of the first rank at all stations are 
comparable on duration.  The period of them 
changes from 9 till 20 years.  As in researched 
lines long fluctuations (cycles 2 ranks) with the 
periods of 50-100 years for dates of transition 
through 0° in the autumn and about 50 years for 
 25
dates of transition through 0° are revealed in the 
spring.  
 
For calculation of functions of spectral density 
lines have been transformed into lines of sliding 
five years’ average in volume of 80 values.  The 
maximal shift has been designed proceeding from 
10% of accuracy of its calculation, and has made 
40 years.  The basic functions of spectral density 
have allocated the periods of fluctuations bringing 
the greatest contribution to variability of 
researched sizes. 
 
Thus, for the majority of stations the most 
significant are middle-period fluctuations of 
researched meteorological value.  During the 
winter period the coast of the Far East possesses 
significant enough stocks of a solar energy.  For 
last decade duration of the cold period decreases.

In the mid-1990’s TINRO-Center began to sample 
a hydrographic section from Sakhalin Island to 
Kamchatka Peninsula (49°30’ - 52°19’N).  The 
basic purpose is to estimate the inter-annual 
variability of temperature, salinity and water 
transport of the West Kamchatka Current (WKC).  
As a rule, the section is being conducted during 
March-April when the western half of the sea is 
covered with an ice fields and the eastern part (to 
the east of 149°E) of the section is accessible only 
for research.  Nevertheless the WKC front, located 
between 150-154°E, is encompassed completely 
by investigations. 
 
Cooling of the Okhotsk Sea started in late 1990s, 
occurring non-uniformly.  In the active layer (0-
200 m) it began in 1998-1999 and has lasted till 
2001.  In intermediate and deep waters a sharp 
downturn of temperature occurred in 2000.  In the 
early part of the next decade, a general increase of 
temperature in the whole water column developed 
but values remained below those observed during 
the mid-1990’s.  During the 1995-1997 warm 
period positive SSTs prevailed.  In intermediate 
layers an uplift of deeper waters along the 
continental slope was noted.  The core of deep 
Pacific waters, identified by the 2.5°C isotherm 
rose to 600 m, and its width attained 150-200 km.  
During the 1999 till 2001 cold period, negative 
SSTs dominated, and an uplift of the deep waters 
was not observed.  The core of deep water was 
located beneath 700 m and its width did not 
exceed 150 km. 
 
The salinity in the 0-200 m layer conformed to 
that of temperature.  In deep layers an appreciable 
salinity rise was observed in 1999 and 2001.  That 
related to a strengthening of the WKC, the 
intensity of which depends on water exchange 
with the Pacific.  Along with weakening of the 
WKC in the beginning of current decade the 
salinity decreased to the level of mid 1990s. 
 
Sea surface temperature in the Sea of Okhotsk has 
a high correlation (r = -0.95 with 95% level 
significance) with an ice cover extent that, in turn, 
depends on intensity of cooling.  The temperature 
of intermediate and deep waters is well correlated 
with each other (r = 0.96) and with current 
velocities in the layer 500-1000 m (-0.82 and –
0.81 m s
-1
 respectively) that reflects the intensity 
of inflow of Pacific water. 
 
Thus thermohaline changes in the upper and deep 
layers are influenced by different causes. 
Respectively, the correlation between the sea 
surface and deep water temperature is weak (r = 
0.5), indicating that inter-annual changes in 
different layers of the Okhotsk Sea do not occur in 
an identical mode and processes there should be 
investigated individually.

The interannual variability of thermal conditions 
in the Okhotsk Sea has been described in papers 
by Vinokurova T.T. (1965, 1972), Kitani (1973), 
Davydov I.V. (1975), Chernyavsky V.I. (1973, 
1992), Pavlychev V.P. et al. (1989), Luchin V.A. 
and Lavrentiev V.M. (1997), Figurkin A.L. 
(1997), Moroz V.V. (1999), Zhigalov I.A. (2000, 
2001), Zhigalov I.A. and Luchin V.A. (2002), and 
Khen G.V. (2002).  These authors used different 
criteria to identify long-term water temperature 
fluctuations.  Data was analyzed for several parts 
of the sea only, some data sets being limited in 
time.  In addition, there are gaps in observational 
series that, on the whole, made it difficult to define 
warm and cold periods in the Okhotsk Sea thermal 
regime. 
 
We examined the long-term variability of the 
oceanographic regime of the Okhotsk Sea in the 
second half of the twentieth century using data at 
about 94,000 oceanographic stations that were 
collected by different organizations in Russia, 
Japan, and the U.S.A.  To assess interannual 
variability, the Okhotsk Sea was divided into 
relatively homogeneous regions of 2° latitude by 
3° longitude.   
 
Water temperature anomalies arising from the 
influence of thermodynamic factors are evident for 
a long time within a year and cover extended areas 
because large-scale characteristics of water 
temperature distribution at the depth of 50 m that 
form in winter are preserved till September and 
because seasonal warming of the top quasi-
homogeneous layer in spring and summer does 
not, as a rule, exceed 30 m depth.   
 
The spatial and temporal structure of the water 
temperature fields were analyzed and the missing 
data restored using the method of initial fields 
decomposition by the empirical orthogonal 
functions (EOF).  To exclude the seasonal trend, 
water temperature data were preliminarily 
centered, i.e. every calculated point was 
represented as a deviation from the average multi-
year monthly values at 50 m depth.  The fields 
reconstructed from the yearly anomalies of water 
temperature registered from March to July served 
as the initial data for calculations. 
 
The first four components of the EOF 
decomposition (Fig. 1) describe the main features 
of the large-scale thermal variability.  Components 
of a higher order are formed under the influence of 
multiple small-scale factors that are difficult to 
interpret.  Besides, the variability of higher-order 
components is of a magnitude that is comparable 
with the error level of the observations and 
calculation process.  Thus, their exclusion may be 
interpreted as additional data smoothing that 
minimizes generality of the system analyzed. 
 
The first EOF is related to synchronous 
interannual fluctuations over much of the Okhotsk 
Sea (Fig. 1), except the very southern part.  The 
second EOF shows lower-scale processes, 
maximum variability being observed in the very 
southern part of the sea.  This component also 
reflects the antiphase character of water 
temperature fluctuations in the northern and 
southern areas.  The third EOF shows the 
antiphase character occurring in the central part of 
the sea and peripheral areas.  As is seen from the 
spatial pattern of the fourth component, thermal 
processes in the central and southern part of the 
sea are in antiphase position with the northern part 
of the sea and the area adjacent to the Kuril Islands 
(Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 Distribution of the first four EOFs of water temperature at 50 m depth in the Okhotsk Sea. 
 
 
As was noted above, the first component describes 
the largest scale processes and accounts for the 
synchronous fluctuations in water temperature 
within the Okhotsk Sea.  Other components show 
the redistribution of the thermal potential between 
separate parts of the Okhotsk Sea and reflect local 
influences.  Thus, they should be taken into 
account when assessing the thermal regime of 
separate parts of the Okhotsk Sea.  This is 
especially critical for the waters that are subject to 
the influence of EOF component extremes.  This is 
confirmed by a correlation matrix that shows the 
comparative significance of the first EOF 
component and the sum of the first four 
components for those areas where component 
extremes are found (Fig. 2).

The temporal variability of the first EOF and that

indicates that 2-4-year fluctuations make the main 
contribution of water temperature variability.  The 
following climatic tendencies are traced in the

indicate a warming period from the 1970s to 
middle 1990s and a cooling period from mid-
1990s to the present.

Composite images of the distribution and 
variability of fronts, eddies, and currents make it 
difficult for researchers to understand variability 
of oceanographic conditions of the Japan Sea and 
to allocate annual patterns to one type or another.  
The results of processing and analysis of satellite 
information for the last 20 years now make it 
possible to classify annual conditions in the Japan 
Sea which greatly simplifies the analysis of 
interannual variability.  In a basis the rule of the 
Subarctic “Polar” front in western part of the 
Japan Sea was offered to this typification, as its 
general rule in central and in east part remains 
rather stationary.  Three are allocated such as a 
rule of the Subarctic front in western part of the 
sea: southern, northern and intermediate (Fig. 1).  
Conditionally it is possible to consider, that at the 
first type (C) in area of a northwest part of the sea, 
at southern Primorye there are conditions for a 
type of “cold” years, at second (W) - “warm” 
years, and at third (Int.). - intermediate.  We speak 
“conditionally”, as the allocated types testify only 
to prevalence of subtropical waters to north, or 
subarctic to the south.  The absolute meanings of 
temperatures at the surface of the sea thus can be 
above or below average, and at a “warm” type on 
our classification in a northwest part of the sea the 
negative anomalies of temperature or, on the 
contrary can be marked, at a “cold” type - positive.  
In addition, to the basic three types, two subtypes 
were added: (Ca) – a cold subtype when strong 
southward advection of cold coastal currents along 
coast of Korea and southern Primorye, and (Wa) – 
occurs when there is significant development of 
the East Korean Current and, as the result, 
significant northward advection of heat along the 
coast of Korea with only a narrow, rather cold 
zone. 
 
The classification scheme was applied to all 
seasons.  On the basis of this scheme, almost all 
1980s appeared cold, and based on the 
development of a branch of the Tsushima Current 
in the 1990s, are similar to years with significant 
development of the East-Korean current (warm

type).  The same type can persist in all seasons 
(e.g.: 1982 and 1995) and there are years (e.g.: 
1981, 1983, 1984) when different types appear 
within a single year.  This is due to the direct 
influence of solar radiation and the atmosphere, 
especially during summer seasons.  
 
It is natural that pure types of each classification 
are not observed in nature.  The general picture is 
complicated by vertical structure of branches of 
currents, meandering, and also seasonal and 
interannual variability of conditions.  It is 
influenced by the monsoon climate. The large 
influence changes the character of exchange of 
water through the three straits (Korean, Tsugaru, 
La Perouse).  Therefore, hydrological structures in 
the Japan Sea can differ substantially from the 
offered pattern.  It is also brings an interesting 
perspective that the mechanism of advection of 
waters to Peter the Great Bay, as it can be 
connected to the direction and volume of flows 
and deep-sea of fishes living in the winter in the 
southern part of the Japan Sea.  
 
The main thermal patterns (fronts, eddies and 
meanders) are reported in Table 1.

Last isolation of Kuril Island as a result of post-glacial transgression

The main morphological features and shape of 
the modern coastal line of the Sea of Okhotsk 
were formed by the Pleistocene (about 1.8 
million years ago).  The further evolution of the 
basin was basically limited by global climate 
changes, reflected in the alternation of 
interglacial and glacial epochs.  Growth and 
melting of polar ice caps resulted in fluctuations 
of sea level from minus 110-130 m to plus 10 m 
(Markov and Syetova 1965).  Modern 
ecosystems in the Kuril archipelago were 
formed over the course of the large-scale Late 
Wurm regression and following transgression. 
 
At the last climatic minimum (15-18,000 y.b.p.) 
the sea level was lower by 130 m and most of 
the modern shelf was land.  We constructed a 
map of Sea of Okhotsk of that time (Beszvernyi 
et al., 2002) where the islands of Sakhalin, 
Hokkaido, Kunashir, and probably Iturup 
formed a single block connected with Prymorye.  
The islands of Paramushir and Shumshu were 
connected with Kamchatka.  The islands of Urup 
and Black Brothers were combined as separate 
territorial blocks, and also Ekarma, Shiashcotan, 
Harimcotan and Оnecotan, apparently.  At this time, 
various species of biota were available to penetrate 
from the south and the north.  However, severe 
climatic conditions interfered with the penetration of 
thermophilic elements from the south, and 
migrations from the north were interfered by 
Krusenstern's, Byssol, and Frieze deep-water 
passages. 
 
Global warming started about 15-13,000 y.b.p. and 
the postglacial transgression began.  The rate of sea 
level rise was maximal (8 mm y
-1
) before 7000 
years, which was reduced thereafter to 1.4 mm y
-1
.  
The transition from cold conditions was very sharp, 
so in eastern China for example, the average annual 
air temperature rose by 7° С over a period of 800 
years (13,200-14,000 ybp) (Yang Yuai-jen, 1983).  
The recent isolation of the southern and northern 
Kuril islands began (Table 1), and it had a 
significant influence on the modern biota of the 
Kuril islands.

Introduction 
Changes in the level of the World Ocean obtained 
with the aid of altimetry sensors established on 
satellite within the framework of project TOPEX-
Poseidon (TP), have received recently a wide 
expansion at research of the broad audience of 
dynamic processes - seasonal fluctuations of a 
level and circulation in various areas, allocation of 
vortical structures and some others, having the 
important scientific and applied value for scientific 
tasks.  Identification of vortical formations with 
simultaneous measurement of SST and 
chlorophyll a concentrations are used intensively 
in hydro-biological research, including fisheries 
management.  Many studies (Crawford and Batten 
2002, Romanov et al. 1997, Shatohin 1981) are 
devoted to these questions. 
 
However, in coastal areas of the ocean and in 
particular in the marginal seas, altimetry data has 
some essential difficulties due to the inability of 
the global tidal models to account for ocean tides 
(Anderson et al. 1995, Choi et al. 1999, and Ray 
1999).  Various corrections have been developed 
for each specific region based upon more exact 
regional numerical models that assimilate the 
available data on the characteristics of tide, 
received from coastal sea level gauges or 
independent buoy stations.  Recently, some 
attempts have been undertaken for the Sea of 
Japan, though the amplitude of tide in this region 
is rather insignificant (Hirose et al. 1999, 
Morimoto et al. 2000).  
 
There is a much more important question of 
having a reliable model of tides in the Sea of 
Okhotsk because tidal amplitudes are so much 
greater.  The range of tidal level fluctuations in 
northwest and especially in the northeast parts of 
Sea of Okhotsk reaches several meters in 
amplitude.  At the same time, according to coastal 
observations, the amplitude of the annual 
harmonic, giving the basic contribution to seasonal 
variations, does not exceed 10 cm (Poezzhalova 
and Shevchenko 1997) and the deviations of sea 
level due to eddies and other interesting 
phenomena have approximately the same 
amplitude.  Therefore, analysis of the satellite 
altimetry data, particularly to identify eddy 
activity and research of other dynamic processes 
in this area, to provide a reliable accounting for 
tides is extremely important.  Their deforming 
influence can cause significant errors for data 
processing and interpretation of results. 
 
The spatial structure of tides in the Sea of Okhotsk 
has a rather complex character.  Tidal waves 
penetrate from the Pacific Ocean through the 
straits of the Kuril ridge, reflect off the coastal 
borders and form the complex interference pattern 
 34
that is observed; for semidiurnal tidal waves, some areas of amphidromy are formed and etc. 
 
Significant seasonal variability of amplitudes and 
phases of tidal waves is observed.  Ice cover 
formation and even complete freezing (to the 
bottom) in some shallow areas occur, as does the 
formation of ice-free zones in areas with strong 
tides and squeezing winds and nonlinear effects 
(Sgibneva 1981, Shevchenko 1996).  Thus tidal 
modeling in the Sea of Okhotsk is rather difficult, 
so the results of calculations within the framework 
of regional models (Kowalik and Polyakov 1998, 
Romanekov 1996, Suzuki and Kanari 1986) as 
well as global (Choi et al. 1999), do not provide 
enough accuracy to process the satellite data on 
fluctuations of sea level. 
 
One of the most effective methods of solving this 
problem is an approach suggested by Canadian 
scientists (Cherniawsky et al. 2001), based on the 
analysis of characteristics of tidal fluctuations 
directly at a point in the sea from obtained in it 
satellite altimetry dataset, direct calculation of 
harmonic constants and subtraction of the 
predicted tide.  
 
At the present time, datasets are sufficiently long 
that reliable results, free of the tidal influence, are 
possible.  Data on acyclic fluctuations of sea level 
and the defining features of the spatial structure of 
tidal waves in the Sea of Okhotsk are other 
important problems to be tackled.  These tasks, in 
addition to developing a reliable method of tidal 
filtration from ТР altimetry data, are the basic 
purpose of the present research.  
 
The initial data 
Radar altimeter (R А) is usually a nadir-oriented 
active microwave sensor, radiating in the range 
from 13-14 GHz.  The downward-oriented 
electromagnetic impulse interacts with the 
terrestrial or sea surface and reflects back to the 
altimeter antenna.  The full propagation cycle time 
from the R А to the surface and back is measured 
with high accuracy, and then by multiplication to 
speed of distribution of electromagnetic radiation, 
the height of the reception antenna of the satellite 
above a reflecting surface is calculated. 
 
The atmosphere and ionosphere slow the speed of 
radio impulses, proportional to the full weight of 
the atmosphere, to water vapor weight in the 
atmosphere, and to the number of free electrons in 
the ionosphere.  The impulse is not reflected from 
an average sea level, but from levels determined 
by wave height and wind speed.  As a 
consequence of these effects, mistakes in 
determining sea surface height cannot be ignored. 
 
TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry data were used as 
initial altimetry data.  These data were obtained 
from the NASA Physical Oceanography 
Distributed Active Archive Center at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of 
Technology.  
 
For sea level calculations relative to a reference 
ellipsoid (the first-order definition of the non-
spherical shape of the Earth as a revolving 
ellipsoid with an equatorial radius of 6378.1363 
km and a flattening coefficient of 1/298.257) from 
satellite altimeter data, the following equations 
were applied: 
 
IB EMB I DT W Т A C У
H C C C C H H H − + + + + − = ) ( 
 
Where Н
Y
 - a sea level, Нс - height of an orbit of 
the satellite, Н

troposphere correction, С
D Т
  - dry troposphere 
correction, С

  - ionosphere correction, С
EMB

IB
 - inverse 
barometer correction. 
 
To obtain all necessary corrections to the altimetry 
signal, standard techniques from a 
TOPEX/Poseidon MGDR-B dataset were 
considered according to recommendations in 
(Benada 2002). 
 
The dry troposphere correction adjusts for the 
influence of “dry” gases on the distribution of the 
electromagnetic signal in the troposphere.  These 
gases contribute to troposphere refraction, 
depending on their density and temperature.  
Further, if the conditions of ideal gases are 
satisfied, and if the hydrostatic equation is used, 
we note that the vertical distribution of the signal 
delay depends only on surface pressure P, hence:

)). 2 cos( 0026 . 0 1 ( 227 . 2 ϕ + − = P C
D Т
 
 
where φ – is the latitude of a point of supervision. 
So it is possible to calculate the correction in a 
range of 2.2-2.3 meters, to within millimeter 
accuracy.  We note that this correction is 
practically constant and determined to within 
several millimeters.  The error of the correction on 
dry troposphere is approximately 0.7 cm. 
 
The wet troposphere correction cannot be 
calculated as precisely as the dry troposphere 
correction because it depends on amounts of water 
vapor.  Direct simultaneous measurement is 
applied, using active or passive microwave 
radiometer soundings on two or more frequencies.  
TOPEX microwave radiometer (TMR) uses 
signals on frequencies 18, 21 and 37 GHz:  the 
water vapor signal is measured by 21 GHz 
channel, while 18 GHz channel deletes surface 
issue (influence of a wind speed), and 37 GHz 
channel removes other atmospheric contributions 
(influence of a covering, clouds etc.). 
Measurements are incorporated to estimate errors 
in distance due to water vapor.  An error of similar 
measurements is approximately 1.2 cm.  
 
As with the wet troposphere correction, an 
ionosphere correction range is strongly changeable 
so it is better to estimate this by direct 
measurement, using double frequencies of the 
microwave sensor.  Until now, except for 
TOPEX/Poseidon, all other satellites have been 
equipped with devices with a unique frequency.  
The two-band radar (Ku and C ranges) of the 
TOPEX/Poseidon satellite provides reliable TEC 
(total electron content in the ionosphere) 
estimation and, hence, the reliable correction of 
optical length of a path.  The following equation is 
used:

Because of sea waves, troughs create more 
reflecting elements than crests.  There is an 
additional error leads at averaging to displacement 
aside of hollows, underestimating a real level. 
Such, so-called, electromagnetic bias (EMB) 
grows with increase in significant wave height 
(SWH) and is usually corrected by an empirical 
function using altimeter-measured SWH.  The 
theoretical understanding of electromagnetic bias 
remains limited and continues to be a topic of 
ongoing research.  The current, most exact 
estimations are based on Gaspar results: 
 
EMB = - SWH [a + b*SWH + c*U + d*U2], 
 
where EMB - electromagnetic displacement (m), 
SWH - significant wave height (m), and U - wind 
speed (m s
-1
).

 a = + 0.0203  a = + 0.03360

 c = + 0.00369  c = -0.00144 
 d = -0.000149  d = + 0.000052 
 
Sea surface height tends to decrease or increase in 
reaction to variation in atmosphere pressure.  In 
general, an increase of 1 mb in atmospheric 
pressure lowers sea surface height by 
approximately 1 cm.  Hence, the effect of an 
inverse barometer is just the deepening of sea 
surface level under the weight of a column of air 
pressing on this surface.  Pressure is calculated as 
follows: 
 
P = C
DT 
/ (-2.277 × (1 + (0.0026 * cos (2×10

× f 
× π/180.0)))) 
where C
DT
 - the correction on dry troposphere, f - 
frequency in GHz.  The inverse barometer 
correction is 
 
Н
IB
 = -0.09948 (P-1013. 3) 
 
The correction is added to an altimeter range or 
subtracted from a sea surface height.  The 
multiplier 9.948 is based on theoretical value of a 
static inverse barometer in mid-latitudes.  Also, 
1013.3 is a rating value of atmospheric pressure in 
the mid-latitudes.  
 
Further, the processed altimetry data were 
assembled in a regular grid as follows.  The area in 
the vicinity of a grid node are taken with radius in 
2.5° where the altimetry sea level data were 
chosen.  Then, if there is more than one altimetry 
data value in the chosen area, there was an 
 36
averaging procedure for existing sea level values 
with respect to the number of satellite passes.  
Thus, only the same satellite pass and time-close 
altimetry level points were used in the spatial and 
temporal averaging procedure for a particular pass 
and so on for all values chosen in the area of 
altimetry measurements.  On Figure 1, the regular 
grid node arrangement with a 1° × 1° step is 
represented, chosen for a region with real 
TOPEX/Poseidon passes.  In the area in the 
vicinity of several units of a regular grid, 
especially in the southern part of an area, there 
were no altimeter data, due to the increasing 
distance between satellite tracks.  In this case, the 
unit simply did not participate in the further 
research.

Design procedure of harmonic constants of tide 
The tidal level in some point of the sea at time 
moment t can be presented as a combination of a 
set of L harmonics (tidal waves) (Duvanin 1960; 
Godin 1972): 
 
X(t) = S+ Σf
j
(t) H
j
 cos ( ω
j
 t –U 
j
 (t) – g
j
) 
 
where S is an average level, f
j
(t) is an amplitude 
multiplier, U
j
(t) is the phase correction, both 
parameters for each wave depend on time, but are 
known (could be determined by astronomical 
conditions at the moment of measurement), ω
j
 is 
the wave frequency, H
j
  g
j
 are harmonic constants, 
amplitudes and phases.  Namely, a definition from 
supervisions is the primary goal of the tidal 
analysis. 
 
Some well-known modifications of the least 
squares method (Godin 1972) for a case when the 
data are registered irregularly or when 
measurements cover too large an interval over 
which it is impossible to count astronomical 
parameter constants for the period of 
measurements are represented.  
 
For each countdown t

which allows an application of the least squares 
method under the standard scheme.  Here S - one 
more variable is subject to definition.  Such 
approach has been chosen according to (Puzankov 
and Shevchenko 2001) where by applying 
harmonic analysis to SST seasonal fluctuations in 
the Sea of Okhotsk, a problem of “average value 
bias” appeared because of asymmetry in the 
number of available data during winter and 
summer period that resulted in mistakes in the 
estimated amplitudes of the annual and semi-
annual harmonics.  In this case this precaution 
appeared excessive - distinction between average 
values on a set and by results of calculations for 
the majority of points was in the third decimal 
place, and only in separate cases reached 1 mm.  
 
Thus, we have the standard method of the least 
squares normal system of the linear equations  
 
Ax = b, 
 
Where A is a square matrix m × m (see Table 1) 
where m = 2L+1, the maximal number of 
considered harmonics L =67, including annual and 
semi-annual waves Sa and Ssa, the length of 
measurements sequence is not limited.  
 
We used decomposition of an initial matrix as A = 
UDR where matrix U consists of m mutually 
orthogonal nonzero rows, R - the top triangular 
matrix with m × m size, and D = (U
T
U)
-1
.  Such 
decomposition exists, if the rows of matrix A are 
linearly independent.  Condition U
T
 (b-Ax) = 0 
defines nonsingular triangular system of equations 
Rx = U
T
b which can be solved by a method of 
back-substitution.  We shall notice, that matrix R = 
U
T
A and vector U
T
b are received with the aid of 
the same transformation U
T
 applied to matrix A 
and vector b accordingly.  
 
Reducing to the form Rx = U
T
b is carried out for 
m the steps as a matter of fact representing 
procedure of Gauss exception with simultaneous 
rows orthogonalization of matrix A.  As matrix U 
is orthonormalized, then R represents the top 
triangular matrix in Holetsky decomposition for 
A
T
A, that enables to use iterative specification of 
the decision.  
 
In each iteration, the residual vector r

rows of matrix A are linearly dependent (within 
machine accuracy), or the iterations fail, a 
message on impossibility of a solution is 
displayed.  
 
Usually a similar problem arrives for tidal waves 
with close frequencies.  There is Rayleigh criterion 
(Godin 1972) for definition of division opportunity 
for such waves in case of the usual sets received 
by the standard tide gauge device, which are the 
values with the fixed step-type behavior.  However 
for ТР data, taking into account the interruptions 
in the Okhotsk Sea because of ice cover on most 
of the sea, it is not possible to formulate similar 
criterion.  We did not go beyond the above-
mentioned formal definition of the system decision 
stability of the harmonics set formation in this 
case.

Initial Tide Residual
 
Fig. 2 Initial, predicted tidal and residual 
altimetry sea level data in the spots 64 (a, Japan 
Sea, weak tides and well-expressed seasonal 
oscillations), 185 (b, Sakhalinsky Bay, the shortest 
data set because of ice cover) and 294 (c, 
Penjinskaya Guba, very strong tides). 
 
It is necessary to note that the absence of altimetry 
data in winter results in instabilities for calculating 
annual (Sa) and semi-annual (Ssa) components 
such as were applied in the northeastern Pacific 
Ocean (Cherniawsky et al. 2001).  For conditions 
of the Sea of Okhotsk it was necessary to exclude 
them.  A similar problem has arisen for seasonal 
level fluctuations in the Bering Strait region 
(Cherniawsky et al. 2001). 
 
Where, as a result of interpolation from two tracks 
the number of sea level values exceeded 500, 60 
harmonics were reliably determined.  Where the 
length number of sea level values was within 280-
320, more than 40 harmonics were calculated, 
athough on further calculations, following 
(Cherniawsky et al. 2001), we were limited to 
estimating the parameters of 18 tidal waves with 
the dominant role in determining tides in the Sea 
of Okhotsk.  The calculation of these waves is 
stable within the bounds of the study area, 
including the Gulf of Sakhalin where the ice cover 
is steadiest and where the shortest TP dataset for 
10 years is obtained - 144 values (Fig. 2a).  
 
Probably, the absence of harmonic pairs for which 
in the mentioned above work the aliasing 
phenomenon was observed, is caused by increase 
in the analyzed period of observation (with 6 to 10 
years in the present work), and also usage of 
steadier algorithm for the linear systems solving.  
 
The high correspondence between initial sea level 
values and the residual tide values, as well as 
between the measured values of amplitudes and 
phases in the next points, and also the size of the 
residual fluctuations including seasonal variations 
and the response of sea surface under the influence 
of surface atmospheric pressure and wind speed 
variations (having an amplitude rms about 10 cm) 
indicates to a reliable estimation of harmonic 
constant tidal waves.  This value is close to an 
average size estimation of the residual variations 
calculated for Sakhalin coastal tide gauges 
(Shevchenko 1997).  
 
A little bit large, but close enough range of 
residual fluctuations has been received and in a 
northeast part of the sea, on approaches to Gulf 
Penjinskaya Guba where tides reach the greatest 
value - apparently from Figure 2c, their range at a 
given point is about 8 m.  Here again it was not 
possible to identify seasonal variations in residual 
fluctuations.  It is caused by influence of an ice 
cover also.  
 
This type of sea level fluctuation is well 
determined in the southwestern part of the Sea of 
Okhotsk, where the amplitudes of the annual 
harmonic having, according to satellite altimetry 
data about 7-8 cm, and accorded with the results of 
calculations for stations Korsakov, Starodubskoe 
and Poronaysk (Poezzhalova and Shevchenko 
1997).  There are no problems to calculate the 
annual and semi-annual harmonics in the analyzed 
a 
b 
c 
 39
part of the Sea of Japan (Fig. 2a), nor at the Kuril 
region of the Pacific Ocean where the influence of 
ice is insignificant. 
 
The given examples show, that a tidal component 
according to satellite altimetry data is quite stably 
determined and might be predicted and removed 
from initial dataset with high accuracy.  More than 
90% of the chosen points have got the amplitude 
rms of residual fluctuations about 8-10 cm, and 
12-16 cm for the others that allows to approach to 
the circulation in the Sea of Okhotsk research 
problems solving, to determining of various type 
vortical structures and the some other important 
problems settling at completely different level of 
accuracy.  
 
Spatial distribution of amplitudes and phases of 
the basic waves 
Let us now consider the results of the harmonic 
analysis of the satellite altimetry data from the 
point of view of features of spatial structure of the 
basic tidal waves.  On Figure 3b, the amplitude 
isolines and phase for the main daily wave, K1, 
are constructed from calculated grid points by 
means of Surfer software.  This harmonic has its 
smallest amplitudes in the southwestern part of the 
research area where its range is about 7-10 cm, 
and the quantity grows in a northwest direction.  
The greatest values of K1 amplitude exceed 2 m in 
Shelikhov Bay, on approaches to Gulf Penjinskaya 
Guba.  These results corresponding well with the 
coastal measurement analysis (Anon. 1960).  Let 
us note that numerical modeling of tides in Sea of 
Okhotsk for the given area have great difficulties, 
and the estaimted heights of the daily tide are 
essentially below the real values (Choi et al. 1999; 
Kowalik and Plolyakov 1998; Suzuki and Kanari 
1986).  More exact results for the given area have 
been obtained (Romanenkov 1996) but the 
calculations were carried out to estimate the 
efficiency of a planned tidal power station in the 
Penjinskaya Guba region.  Also from the 
numerical modeling, the area of greatest amplitude 
extended from the entrance of Shelikhova Bay to 
the open sea, approximately along of the shelf 
edge, was not allocated in such obvious kind.  The 
area of lower than observed amplitudes, daily tides 
at southeast coast of Sakhalin, is caused most 
likely by the large distance from the coast to our 
chosen grid points. 
The spatial structure of К1 phase distribution has a 
simple character and corresponds quite well to 
results of numerical modeling.  It specifies a zonal, 
west-oriented wave direction in adjoining area of 
Pacific Ocean and the basic inflow to the Sea of 
Okhotsk through straits in the northern part of the 
Kuril ridge.  Inside the sea, the primary 
distribution of daily tide from the northern Kuriles 
travels in a northwest direction, reaching the 
coasts of Sakhalin and Magadan at approximately 
the same time, and achieves Shantarskie islands in 
some hours.  
 
The spatial distribution of the amplitudes and 
phases of another important daily wave, О1, has a 
structure similar to K1 (Fig. 3).  Let us note that 
the combination of these waves creates the 
characteristic fortnight variability of tides in the 
Sea of Okhotsk, shown both in sea level 
fluctuations and in tidal currents (Putov and 
Shevchenko 1998; Odamaki 1994; Shevchenko 
and Kantakov 2001).  It is quite possible, that an 
unsatisfactory removal of tides from the satellite 
altimetry data, namely this modulation, creates 
false anomalies of “pure tidal origin” that are 
perceived as quickly displaced vortical structures.  
 
A more complex and interesting picture is evident 
for the basic semidiurnal wave М2 (Fig. 4а, b).  
The distribution of amplitudes has sharp increases 
in the northern part of Tatar Strait, along the 
continental coast in northern part of the Okhotsk 
Sea (>1 m), at the Kamchatka coast of Shelikhova 
Bay, and on approaches to Gulf of Penjinskaya 
Guba.  These also correspond well to the analysis 
of coastal tide gauges. 
 
The semidiurnal tide amphidromes, areas with 
very small amplitudes of М2, are found in the 
southern part of Tatar Strait, along the east coast 
of Sakhalin and at its northern extremity, and also 
at the western coast of Shelikhova Bay.  The 
presence of these amphidromic regions was first 
demonstrated by (Ogura 1933) from analysis of 
the coastal measurements, and but also received as 
a result of numerical modeling (Suzuki and Kanari 
1986; Kowalik and Polyakov 1998; Choi et al. 
1999; Romanenkov 1996).  The exception was the 
area along the east coast of Sakhalin that was not 
identified by results of calculations at all (Suzuki 
and Kanari 1986; Choi et al. 1999).

Both the position and the range of the 
amphidromes at the northern end of Sakhalin 
Island and in Shelikhova Bay are well matched to 
the results of numerical modeling.  At the same 
time, areas of small amplitudes of M2 in the 
southern part of Tatar Strait and in particular in the 
central part of the Sea of Okhotsk (Fig. 3b) look a 
little more extensive than it could be considered.  
Obviously, it is caused by the complex character 
of the bottom relief and coastline of the Sea of 
Okhotsk.  Probably, this circumstance was the 
main reason for the difficulties in modeling the 
semidiurnal tides in this area.  
 
The mentioned above M2 amphidromy area in 
Tatar Strait, according to satellite altimetry data, 
not only appears more extensive, but is located a 
little bit to the south than it should be considered.   
 
The spatial distribution of another important 
semidiurnal wave, S2, has a character that is very 
close to М2, only with an appreciable reduction of 
amplitude.  In the East Sakhalin region, the 
amphidromy area is displaced from the coast to the 
open sea direction, and small amplitudes are closer 
to continental coast in Tatar Strait.  Amphidromy 
is not expressed in the latter case, the reduction of 
amplitude is observed, and circular movement of 
phases is absent.   
 
The results have provided a detailed picture of 
harmonic constant tidal waves distribution in such 
a complex pool as the Sea of Okhotsk.  They also 
can be used for calculation of tidal current speeds 
and tidal energy dissipation estimation in the 
entire sea and its separate parts, including 
calculation of position of theoretical zero of depths 
and other important applied problems. 
 
Conclusions 
1. An effective way of eliminating tidal 
components from the satellite altimetry data is 
offered, allowing a residual tide with rms 
amplitude of about 10 cm at the range of the 
measured fluctuations from 2 to 8 m.  
2. Spatial distributions of amplitudes and phases 
of the basic tidal waves in the Sea of Okhotsk 
and adjoining areas are made.  More than 2 m 
of daily waves amplitude values on 
approaches to the Gulf of Penjinskaya Guba, 
and also areas of high intensity of fluctuations 
in the open sea in region, adjoining to 
Shelikhova Bay that has not been found in 
known regional numerical models are 
received. 
3. For main semidiurnal waves, М2 and S2, all 
known amphidromies were identified.  It is 
shown that the area of small amplitudes of М2 
has a more southern location and occupies a 
larger area than was considered in Tatar Strait 
and has a significant extension to the open sea 
region on the east coast of Sakhalin as well. 
4. The estimated values of the harmonic 
constants of tides in the Sea of Okhotsk can be 
used to calculate tidal current speeds, tidal 
energy dissipation estimation and the settling 
of some other problems that demand an exact 
knowledge of a tidal mode.

We examine the circulation and water properties 
in the western and southern Okhotsk Sea during 
the years 2000-2003 using data from an array of 
profiling floats deployed from Russian and 
Japanese research vessels.  The subsurface drift 
data from these instruments, from depths of 400-
1600 m, show unmistakable evidence of the East 
Sakhalin Current and the southward transport of 
dense shelf water at densities in the range of sq 
of 26.2-27.0 at speeds of 5-15 cm s
-1
.  In the 
southwestern Okhotsk Sea, near Soya (LePerouse) 
Strait, there is evidence of a closed, cyclonic 
circulation at mid-depths.  A number of the floats 
have exited the Okhotsk Sea through Bussol Strait 
and other, shallower straits farther south.  The 
temperature and salinity profiles measured by these 
floats show evidence that Okhotsk Sea water can 
maintain its integrity far into the North Pacific, as 
these floats spread to the south along the Hokkaido 
coast and to the northeast to the Aleutian Islands.

Within the framework of TINRO research of 
biological resources in the Okhotsk Sea during the 
period from August 2001 until July 2002, 926 
hydrological stations were occupied, of which 539 
had a complete set of hydrochemical 
measurements (dissolved oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, 
phosphate and silicate concentration). 
 
Observations completely covered the shelf and 
most of the abyssal region, including the Kuril 
Basin, the central part of the Okhotsk Sea and 
adjacent areas of the Pacific Ocean.  The 
hydrological measurements were carried out using 
a Mark-III CTD.  Samples for hydrochemical 
analysis were taken selectively taking into account 
the thermal structure of the water column.  The 
quantity of samples obtained at each station varied 
from three to 12 depending on the depth and 
complexity of features in the water column.  The 
correctness of bottle samples was determined by 
comparing the salinity of the bottle sample, 
determined using a salinometer, with the data 
obtained from the CTD. 
 
In the abyssal region, a well-determined linear 
connection between nitrate and phosphate 
concentrations was observed during the late winter 
season.  For stations located to the west of the 
Kuril Islands the equation of connection (m = 418, 
R
2
 = 0.99, 1s
2
y
 = 0.64) looks like: 
 
[NO
3
] = 14.89*[PO
4
] –5.54         (1) 
 
For stations located on the Pacific side of the Kuril 
Islands, the relationship is expressed by: 
 
[NO
3
] = 15.78*[PO
4
] – 6.80         (2) 
 
where (m = 89, R
2 
= 0.99, 1s
2
y 
= 0.66 
(dimensionality in µmol/kg). 
For both equations the regression coefficients are 
close to Redfield’s ratio between nitrate and 
phosphate variability. 
 
At the same time in boreal part of the sea, 
including the shelf, the continental slope region 
and TINRO Basin, regular residuals from the 
linear model obtained for the abyssal stations are 
observed.  These deflections are expressed in 
lower nitrate concentration in relation to a given 
phosphate concentration.  The size of these 
deflections named in the further nitrate deficit 
(dNO
3
), can be expressed quantitatively as: 
 
dNO
3
 = [NO
3
]regress – [NO
3
]observ 
 
where: [NO
3
]regress is the concentration of nitrate 
in equation (1) and [NO
3
]observ is the observed 
nitrate concentration. 
 
The greatest nitrate deficits appear in the bottom 
layer of the northwestern part of the shelf and in 
the deep waters of the TINRO Basin.  Without 
examining the hydrochemical mode of the TINRO 
Basin in detail, we note that at depths from 500 m 
to the bottom (980 m), lower concentrations of 
nutrients correspond with increasing 
concentrations of oxygen and declining 
temperature.  These features allow us to assume 
that the region of formation of deep waters of the 
TINRO Basin is, apparently, on boreal shelf of the 
Okhotsk Sea.  
 
The region of maximum nitrate deficit on the 
northwestern shelf matches the extent of dense 
bottom water (depth 125-150 m) in the area that is 
occupied by polynyas during the winter season; 
the low concentrations of nutrients and elevated 
oxygen content confirm this idea.  The increased 
nitrate deficit on the continental slope in the 
 46
northwestern part of the Derugin Basin, showing 
the submergence of dense shelf waters is also 
marked.  Along the southwestern slope of Lebed’ 
Rise, there is an obvious transformation of Pacific 
waters, mixing with shelf bottom waters, as a large 
nitrate deficit here is observed at high nutrient 
concentrations. 
 
On zonal sections, the nitrate deficit is clearly 
observed in the western part of the abyssal pool 
near the East Sakhalin shelf.  In the area of 49°N it 
can be traced down to depths of 600 m.  It is also 
linked, in our opinion, to the sinking of bottom 
shelf waters along the continental slope.  The 
nucleus of these waters is confined to a 26.8 σ
θ
 
density surface (depth about 300 m). Along the 
southern periphery of the counterclockwise 
circulation, these waters extend to the east 
reaching the Kuril straits.  On the eastern side of 
the Okhotsk Sea, off the West-Kamchatka shelf,  
high values of nitrate deficit are also revealed in 
summer.  The core of these residuals is located 
mainly at depths of 40-60 m (26.2-26.3 σ
θ
).  This 
nitrate deficit is possibly caused by decomposition 
of organic matter accumulated at the pycnocline. 
 
The potential physical causes of the nitrate deficit 
include: denitrification (regeneration of nitrate to 
N
2
 or N
2
O), reduced rate of nitrate regeneration 
during organic matter decomposition (in 
comparison with speed of phosphate regeneration), 
various proportions of nitrate and phosphate 
assimilation by coastal and abyssal plankton, etc.  
Irrespective of the causes of formation of the 
nitrate deficit, the latter in our opinion, can be 
used as a tracer of water formed on the northern 
shelf of the Okhotsk Sea.  It seems that the 
distinction of coefficients of proportionality 
between variability of phosphate and nitrate for 
the Pacific waters and waters of an abyssal part of 
the Okhotsk Sea is explained by participation in 
formation of the latter the shelf waters of boreal 
part of the sea.

A survey of the Kuril Basin region in the Okhotsk 
Sea was conducted in February–March 2003 using 
the R/V Dmitry Peskov (Sakhalin Research 
Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography).  The 
goal was to observe aspects of winter circulation 
in the ice-free zone of the Okhotsk Sea based on 
observations of CTD, dissolved oxygen, nutrient 
and carbonate parameters.

Fig. 1 Horizontal distributions of surface 
silicate (µmol/l) for the Kuril Basin area in 
February 2003. 
 
The distribution of chemical parameters in the 
Kuril Basin in the winter of 2003 were affected by 
two anticyclonic eddies: located southwestward of 
the Bussol Strait (E1 eddy) and northward of the 
Bussol Strait (E2 eddy).  The eddy cores were 
formed by warm, saline, low oxygen, high silicate 
Pacific waters.   
The surface layer of E1 eddy was composed of 
cold, fresh Okhotsk Sea water.  A strong vertical 
salinity gradient prevents the deepening of the 
surface layer by winter cooling and thus the 
surface waters of E1 eddy were characterized by 
low silicate (Fig. 1) with a partial pressure of CO
2
 
of ~30–40 ppm below saturation (Fig. 2).   
 
The surface layer of E2 eddy was composed of 
weakly stratified saline waters, probably formed 
by intensive vertical mixing in the Kuril straits.  
These waters had high concentrations of silicate 
(Fig. 1) and were supersaturated with CO
2
 due to 
vertical mixing (Fig. 2).  The highest density 
water, highest concentration of silicate and pCO
2
 
in the surface layer were associated with the E2 
eddy core, mainly due to deep winter convection.

The Derugin Basin is the second big “appendix” 
in the Sea of Okhotsk after the Kuril Basin.  It 
has a maximum depth of about 1760 m and is 
connected to the Kuril Basin by 2 channels with 
sill depth of about 1300 m each.  Due to strong 
stratification in the Derugin Basin reinforced by 
influxes of Pacific waters in the deep layers, is 
not renewed directly from the surface.  The 
formation and renewal of deep waters in the 
Derugin Basin is discussed using new 
hydrochemical and isotopic data obtained during 
a joint Russian-German project KOMEX (Kurile 
Okhotsk Marine Experiment) from 1998-2002.  
Deep waters in the Derugin Basin show some 
features of stagnant waters such as very low 
dissolved oxygen ( ≤14 µM/kg) and high silica ( ≤267 
µM/kg).  The hypothesis of long renewal time of 
deep waters is not consistent with the tritium data.  
The relatively thin deep bottom layer observed on 
vertical profiles of potential temperature and salinity 
and the relatively high spatial variability of some 
water properties such as oxygen suggest relatively 
rapid exchange with the Pacific Ocean.  Low 
dissolved oxygen in the Derugin Basin deep water 
not only indicates poor ventilation, but also that 
waters overflowing to the Derugin Basin belong to 
the strong intermediate oxygen minimum layer 
(about 35 µM/kg) in the Sea of Okhotsk.

Winter CTD surveys taken in January – March 
of 1999-2003 in the ice-free areas of the 
Okhotsk Sea were used to study winter 
convection.  These measurements indicate that 
convection usually penetrates to a depth of 100-
150 m and forms a mixed layer with a density 
greater than 26.6 σ
θ
 within the North Pacific 
inflow.  These modified North Pacific waters 
however do not reach the freezing point.  Winter 
convection does not penetrate deeper than 100 m 
and forms a mixed layer with a density lower 
than 26.5 σ
θ
 in the Okhotsk Sea waters due to 
their low surface salinity.  Interannual variability 
of winter convection is also discussed. 
 
In addition, for the central Okhotsk Sea between 
47-52°N, five CTD surveys taken in September-
November 1998-2002 were used to perform 
volumetric T/S analysis in terms of Modified 
Dense Shelf Waters (MDSW) and Modified 
North Pacific Waters (MNPW) in the density 
range 26.7-27.0 σ
θ
.  Our calculations show that 
the MDSW volume has extremely large 
interannual variability, contributing between 1% 
to 27% of the total volume of the chosen area.  
Moreover, we observed MDSW in the 26.9-27.0 
density range only in 1999 and 2001.  The 
MNPW volume shows much less variability 
contributing 23-36% to the total volume.  The 
five-year average mixing ratio between MDSW 
and MNPW is 1:10 and the five-year average 
residence time of the upper Okhotsk 
Intermediate Water (OIW) is 2.4 years.  The 
large interannual variability of the main 
components of the OIW causes the large 
interannual variations of the isopycnal T/S 
properties.

The Pacific Ocean is ringed by deep trenches 
around much of its margin.  Today, long-term 
deep current measurements over trenches at the 
western and northern edges of the Pacific Ocean 
Central basin are available through Internet.  Some 
of the readily available long-term deep current 
measurements over trenches are found at the 
Home Page of Division of Physical 
Oceanography, Ocean Research Institute, 
University of Tokyo.  
 
Since the purpose of the North Pacific Marine 
Science Organization is to promote and co-
ordinate marine scientific research in the 
temperate and subarctic region of the North 
Pacific, we will analyze, in this report, the 
circulation over the northern part of the Izu-
Ogasawara Trench, Japan Trench, Kuril 
Kamchatka Trench and Aleutian Trench.  We will 
follow Johnson (1998) in the first part of report 
using the illustrations of this work.  
 
No bottom water is formed in the North Pacific 
Ocean.  It enters the Pacific Ocean central basins 
via a deep western boundary current from the 
south.  Data obtained from a current meter array at 
the northern end of the Izu-Ogasawara Trench 
provide evidence of a cyclonic circulation there.  
Statistics for these current meter records are 
available on the home page of the Division of 
Physical Oceanography in the Ocean Research 
Institute at the University of Tokyo.  Some of data 
were analyzed (Johnson 1998).  In this paper, 
attention was focused on 30 current meter records, 
nominally located along 34°N, with deployments 
starting as early as November 1987 and as late as 
May 1995.  The record lengths range from 266 to 
536 days, with an average of 401 days.  Their 
longitudes range from 141.17°E to 142.55°E and 
their depths range from 3830 to 8961 m.  The 
moorings are roughly clustered at six locations, 
and the deep velocities are similar for most depths 
and deployments at each location.  
 
Data from moorings along 34°N (available on the 
home page for the Division of Physical 
Oceanography, Ocean Research Institute, 
University of Tokyo) near the north end of the Izu-
Ogasawara Trench are records exceeding 100 
days.  All are below 3800 m depth.  Data near 
36°N (Hallock and Teague 1996) are between 
2000 and 4200 m at the southern end of the Japan 
Trench.  Vectors are averaged at each location 
(record length weighted) from instruments within 
these depth intervals. 
 
The mean directions are very closely aligned with 
the isobaths, and there is a sense of cyclonic 
circulation around the trench axis.  On the western 
side of the trench, the flow is nominally 
equatorward with magnitudes of 3.6, 4.6, and 2.4 
cm s
-1
, roughly over the 4500, 6000, and 9000-m 
isobaths, respectively.  At the center of the trench 
the velocity has a minimum at 0.8 cm s
-1
, 
nominally equatorward.  On the eastern side of the 
trench the magnitude is 3.0 and 12.8 cm s
-1
, but 
nominally poleward, roughly over the 9000 and 
6000 m isobaths, respectively. 
 
Deep current meter data have been discussed over 
the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench (Johnson 1998), 
which come from a recent deployment of nine 
moorings ranging in position along a line from 
36.40°N, 146.11°E to 42.30°N to 150.23°E.  The 
current meter records are consistent with a deep 
cyclonic circulation over the trench, with 
westward flow on its poleward side and eastward 
flow on its equatorial side.  
 
Current meters were deployed at nominal depths 
of 2000, 3000, and 4000 m for a length of 744 to 
 51
758 days, with one exception of a 379 day record.  
The northwestern mooring is located roughly over 
the 4000 m isobath on the poleward side of the 
trench axis.  The magnitude of the mean velocity 
at 2000 and 3000 m is only 0.2 and 0.5 cm s
-1
, 
respectively, but there is a 4.3 cm s
-1
 flow toward 
259°, nominally westward and roughly parallel to 
the isobaths at 4000 m.  
 
The next mooring to the southeast is located 
between the 7000 and 6500 m isobaths just on the 
equatorward side of the trench axis.  The flow 
directions and magnitudes at this mooring are 
similar at all depths and the record-length average 
is 8.1 cm s
-1
 toward 59°, nominally eastward, 
again roughly parallel to the trench axis. 
 
Another current meter array was occupied over the 
Aleutian Trench along 175°W (Warren and Owens 
1985; 1988).  Since only two moorings are located 
over the trench, a cyclonic sense of circulation 
around the trench is only suggested by these data.  
This circulation may be shifted poleward of the 
trench axis because there is eastward flow over the 
axis.  Five moorings were deployed over a 
fourteen-month period from 45.972 to 50.990°N, 
with current meters located at nominal depths of 
2000, 3000, and 4500 m.  Vertical profiles of the 
mean velocity show a moderate (>3 cm s
-1
) 
negative, nominally westward, flow along isobaths 
on the poleward side of the trench, banked against 
the Aleutian Island arc. 
 
Interest in the problem of water-column stability 
in the deep sea basins was stimulated by 
discussion of possibility of burying radioactive 
wastes there.  Real hydrological conditions in 
trenches make it possible to apply the disturbance 
method for theoretical research.  Firstly, super-
adiabatic gradients of density and temperature are 
small enough to solve the problem linearly.  The 
conditions are stationary since the main factor, 
geothermal heat flux, does not seem to noticeably 
rotate within the time scales under study.  
Secondly, negative stratification layers have a 
significant vertical extent, usually some hundred 
meters.  Due to a large vertical scale of motion, the 
rotation of the earth and the Coriolis acceleration 
play a decisive role in establishing critical 
convection parameters.  The thickness of the 
convective layer and horizontal dimensions of 
cells are of the same order of magnitude.  Hence, it 
becomes necessary to take both horizontal and 
vertical components of the Coriolis force into 
account.  For meridionally aligned trenches, a 
weak thermal shear flow is possible under the 
impact of meridional temperature gradient 
(Muratov 1991).  Together with a stabilizing effect 
of the earth’s rotation, this flow can destabilize 
and change the convection threshold in oceanic 
trenches. 
 
Fig. 1 Calculated neutral curves for Kuril-
Kamchatka Trench (above) and Japan Trench 
(below). 
 
The mathematical approach was developed 
(Muratov 1991) where salinity variations were 
neglected and purely thermal convection was 
considered.  The neutral curves for the Kuril-
Kamchatka and Japan trenches were obtained by 
solving a system of eigenvalues.  Figure 1 
indicates that with less horizontal temperature 
gradient, the threshold of vertical convection 
increases.  The critical Rayleigh number for the 
Kuril-Kamchatka Trench was 5.19 × 10
13
, and 
5.12 × 10
13
 for the Japan Trench.  The minimum 
of the neutral curve for the former is slightly 
shifted relative to the minimum of the latter;  3.8 
and 3.6 respectively so we can conclude that 
destabilization is produced by the advective 
current in the presence of a meridional 
temperature gradient of a convective regime in 
bottom layer of trenches.

Another factor that can lead to instability in the 
bottom layers is the interaction of tidal flows with 
a layer of “convection with velocity shift”.  We 
used the equations for horizontal velocity 
components (Muratov 1991).  To describe friction 
tension we involved Prandtl’s hypothesis of 
mixing (Fang and Ichiye 1983). 
 
 
Fig. 2 Time variability of Richardson’s 
number for harmonic O1 for Kuril Kamchatka 
Trench. 
 
Figure 2 shows the results of calculations of 
dynamic instability.  At first, dynamic stability for 
parameters typical of South Kuril-Kamchatka 
Trench was studied.  Figure 2 presents the time 
variability of Richardson’s number on some 
horizons for harmonic O1 when the Hesselberg-
Sverdrup parameter is equal to 1.  On the whole, 
dynamic stability decreased with depth.  In the  
 
case of the central Japan Trench, the velocity of 
the flux induced by the meridional temperature 
gradient amounts to 2.2 cm s
-1
 outside the friction 
layer and turns out to be comparable with tidal 
velocities.  We also calculated Richardson’s 
number alteration in time on some horizons for the 
M2 tidal wave and values of the tidal flux 
components were 4.3 cm s
-1
 and 3.6 cm s
-1
 (not 
shown).  Transition to instable dynamic regime 
occurs between the horizons of 0.5 and 1 m.  The 
period of its fluctuation amounts to 9 hours;  the 
same periodicity here should be expected in 
intensity of the fine structure generation as well.  
The change of fluctuation frequency of the 
dynamic stability parameter occurs, in this case, 
due to the interaction of an advective shift current 
induced by meridional temperature gradient with 
tidal flux.

In the fall of 1993 an opportunity arose to conduct 
a CTD and hydrographic survey along a line of 
stations through the Okhotsk Sea.  This line of 
observations was conducted to WOCE (World 
Ocean Circulation Experiment) specifications for 
accuracy of sampling and nominal spacing (30 
nautical miles) of stations.  The observations were 
acquired as a joint project involving scientists 
from Canada and Russia to execute the 
westernmost leg of the WOCE line P1, hereinafter 
referred of to as P1W, from the research vessel 
Academik Nesmeyanov operated by the Pacific 
Oceanological Institute in Vladivostok, Russia 
(Freeland, Yurasov et al. 1996). 
 
Thirty-five stations were occupied, and vertical 
profiles extended to the bottom or 3,500 metres, 
whichever was shallower.  The cruise began on 
August 30
th
 and was completed on September 21
st
, 
1993 (Freeland et al. 1996).  Hydrographic 
conditions along the Р1W (WOCE program) 
section were considered in the papers (Dyakov et 
al. 1996; Freeland et al. 1996). 
 
The elements of fine structure (FS) in the Okhotsk 
Sea, up to depths of 3500 m, had not previously 
been considered.  Information on the FS of North 
Pacific Intermediate Water in region 155°E (near 
the beginning of the Р1W section) is presented in 
(Maximenko and Tscherbina 1996).  
 
The influence of various scales of variability of 
physical fields, especially microstructures, on the 
behaviour of marine organisms, has been 
investigated extremely poorly.  The necessity of 
such research is obvious for better understanding 
of plankton and fish larvae dynamics (Nabatov 
1993).  For example, the alternated character of 
turbulence and it existence as separate cellulars is 
one from the reasons of cellulary distribution of 
plankton, that essentially influences on trophic 
relations in a food chains. 
 
The P1W section (first six stations) crosses a 
region of Pacific water adjacent to the Kuril Ridge 
that is characterized by strong eddy activity.  
These mesoscale features are well known from 
oceanographic observations and from satellite 
images (Solomon 1979; Bulatov and Lobanov 
1983; Darnitskiy and Bulatov 1997).  The periodic 
amplifications of FS interactions on spatial scales 
from 26.9 up to 100.1 m in the range of the first 
tens of meters, and from 103.1 – 429.1 m in the 
range of the first hundreds of meters are 
established from spectral analysis of vertical 
structures of seawater density in these stations.  
The spectral density, or density function of 
variances on spatial frequencies of a continuous 
spectrum (Ventsel 1969) for these intrusions were 
changed within the limits of 0.0012 – 0.0084 for 
thin-layer stratification and 0.1257 – 0.0260 for 
large vertical scales.  Intensification of the thin 
structure in the deep water strata was fixed on 
scales 850.5, 1502.0 and 1701.0 m.  The 
appropriate significance of spectral density was 
changed within the limits of 0.0317; 0.0326 and 
0.0659 accordingly. 
 
The FS stratification on an amount of maximum of 
ρ-, T-, S- of FS increased twofold, on average, 
from oceanic stations to the Kuril Ridge, making 
about 12 centers of ρ-, T-, S- of FS in the upper 
400 m stratum near the Kuril Ridge.  At the depth 
of the bottom (Station 6, 2320 m), it has decreased 
more than twofold in comparison with the seaside 
deep-water stations (5000-6760 m).  The reason 
for magnification of the intensity of FS 
stratification of waters near to Kuril Ridge can be 
explained by amplified exchange of Pacific and 
Okhotsk Sea waters through the Kuril Straits. 
 54
The maximum vertical scale in the Okhotsk Sea is 
specified only near Academia Nauk Rise (Station 
10) and has made 1049.0 m.  Maximum scales of 
thin structure above Derugin Basin were observed 
at 630, 640 and 649 m (Stations 16, 17, 11). 
 
The amplification of FS stratification of waters 
was observed on a direction from deep-water 
stations to a slope (Stations 22, 23), where the 
amount of fine structure formations was again 
increased by 2 times compared with the deep-
water regions.  At that, the decrease in the vertical 
scale of the strata up to 116-214 m (Stations 24, 
22) happened, and to the north of Station 25 (depth 
= 330 m) fine structure stratification had the 
scales:  meters - first tens meters, minimizing to 
shallow stations (to Station 30) up to meters.  The 
reason of that is an amplification of factors of 
vertical exchange at 3-15 times and a horizontal 
turbulence scales have the magnitude 50-370 m in 
slope regions (Ozmidov 1985). 
 
The initial stratification of intrusion waters in the 
region of interaction of Kuril Island arc system 
happens under the influence of topography, 
intensive tidal fluctuations of interacting water 
masses in boundary layers (Darnitskiy and Bulatov 
1997) and intensification of internal disturbance 
(Miropolskiy 1980; Navrotskiy 1990). 
 
More deep-water fine structure features are 
probably conditioned by inertial-gravitational 
oscillations of waters and up to 5000 m and more 
are observed (Orlanski and Bryan 1969; 
Pochapsky and Malone 1972; Feodorov 1976, 
1978).  In our case excitation of the seized of 
Poincare’s waves on external (Pacific) part of 
Kuril Ridge are conditioned by overfall depths in 
some thousands of meters.  The obtained 
evaluations probably correspond to resonance 
characteristic of reflected ocean waves, 
determinate by the form and sizes of Kuril shelf 
(Fine, 1984). 
 
The differentiation of density, temperature and 
salinity of FS on depth will be considered in the 
report.

Introduction 
In 2001-2003 SakhNIRO carried out complex 
observations of Aniva Bay shelf waters aboard 
R/V Dmitry Peskov.  Observations included CTD-
sounding of the water column from the sea surface 
to the bottom at the fixed coordinates on four 
standard sections in the bay and at three additional 
sections in La Perouse Strait, with detailed water 
sampling.  The number of stations amounted to 
131 in 2001 (April, June, August, October, and 
November), 161 in 2001 (January, April, June, 
August and October), and 58 in 2003 (April and 
June) (Fig. 1).  On average every survey took 
about 2 days. Hydrological observations in the bay 
were aimed at diagnosing oceanological fields, 
determining the nature of density and wind 
induced water circulation, and identifying specific 
features of seasonal and interannual water and heat 
exchange between Aniva Bay and surrounding 
shelf waters.

Besides the tidal effects and significantly variable 
seasonal atmospheric conditions, hydrophysical 
structure of the La Perouse Strait and Aniva Bay 
waters is mainly dependent on interaction of 
waters of different origin (Biryulin 1954; 
Shelegova 1958; Leonov 1960; Watanabe 1963; 
Moroshkin 1964, 1966; Aota 1970, 1975, 1984; 
Akagawa 1977; Takizava 1982; Aota et al. 1988; 
Watanabe 1995; Budaeva and Makarov 1996, 
1999; Itoh and Ohshima 2000).  Aniva Bay waters 
are close to subarctic waters and have a similar 
stratification.  The vertical thermal structure of 
Aniva Bay water is characterized by a cold 
intermediate layer (CIL) with a negative water 
temperature (-1.5 to -1.6° С). Low water 
temperature in the CIL core is a first indicator of 
its renewal. 
 
Data and methods 
Sea currents in the relatively shallow Aniva Bay 
were estimated from an updated 3D numerical 
baroclinic Ekman-type model with constant 
coefficients of vertical turbulent exchange 
(Budaeva and Makarov 1999).  This sigma-
coordinate model takes into account the real 
bottom relief and coastline, nonuniform 
distribution of density and surface wind, and water 
flows through the open boundaries.  A horizontally 
regular 5′ × 5′ grid was used.  Sea currents at 8 
specified horizons were determined by one-
dimensional interpolation of vertical profiles of the 
3D velocity vector components calculated at every 
horizontal point.  Coastline and sea depth in the 
grid were taken from a bathymetric map of Aniva 
Bay and La Perouse Strait (1:250000 scale along 
52° parallel, 1992).  Boundary conditions at the 
open boundaries were specified according to 
(Kantakov et al. 2002). 
 
Calculated sea currents were verified over 
precomputed characteristics of the density water

structure, such as pycnocline depth and intensity 
and horizontal density gradients.  These 
parameters were used to identify location of eddy 
cores, coastal frontal sections and vergence zones, 
and anomalous water dynamics in Aniva Bay. 
 
Density distribution 
Annual variability of the density structure in 2001-
2003 (Table 1) was characterized by two extreme 
features:  increased nonuniformity of hydro-
physical fields with high absolute values of 
horizontal (up to 0.045-0.075 σ
t
 km
-1
) and vertical 
(up to 0.35-0.50 σ
t
 m
-1
) density gradients in 
summer, and more homogeneous distributions in 
winter with low magnitudes of density gradients 
(up to 0.009 σ
t
 km
-1
 and 0.04 σ
t
 m
-1
, respectively). 
 
Annual variability of the surface density in the bay 
is mainly explained by the seasonal change of 
temperature.  These processes are in antiphase. In 
April-August background surface density was 
falling steadily (from 25.75-26.00 to 22.40-23.6 
σ
t
), whereas it started growing everywhere in 
autumn-winter, from September to March 
approximately.  On the contrary, mean values of 
near-bottom density were falling in autumn-winter 
(mainly due to low water salinity) and growing in 
spring-summer (Table 1).  Location of the 26.5 σ
t
 
isopycnal might be an indirect tracer of the near-
bottom density variability within a year.  In 
November 2001 and October 2002, an area of 
near-bottom waters within this isopycnal was 
much smaller than in spring and summer of the 
same years.  In January 2002, such waters were 
not registered in the southern deep-water part of 
Aniva Bay.  Hence, the annual cycle of the near-
bottom density variability finished with the end of 
the calendar year (2001-2002, 2002-2003).  There 
is a good reason to assume that such a completion 
repeats every year. 
 
Interannual variability of density was 
characterized by significant freshening of all the 
bay waters during a warm season of 2002.  As a 
result, mean values of surface and near-bottom 
density during this year were lower than density 
registered in 2001 and 2003 (Table 1).  The 
presence of closed isolines in the field of 
pycnocline depths might be interpreted as the local 
dynamic structures (see Fig. 2).

Fig. 3 (continued) Sea currents in Aniva Bay, 2002. 
 
 
The character of pycnocline deepening indicates 
that the currents have an anticyclonic vorticity 
during all seasons of the year, but with differing 
extents.  A quasi-stationary anticyclonic eddy A
1
 
is the main structural element here.  Due to 
convergence, this eddy can be the permanent 
accumulator of heat (cold) and polluted coastal 
waters. 
 
The deepest pycnocline location (up to 70-80 m) 
in Aniva Bay during winter is connected with the 
downward density convection, the intensity and 
depth of which are dependent on the extent of the 
cooling of surface waters.  The area of eddy A
1
 
and its intensity with depth are considerably larger 
in winter than in summer.  At the end of the 
calendar year, the whole water mass of Aniva Bay 
is included in this eddy, except for a thin near-
bottom layer.  However, despite its larger size in 
winter compared with summer, its dynamics are 
significantly lower, probably due to the relatively 
homogeneous distribution of both horizontal and 
vertical density gradients and their low 
magnitudes. 
 
Circulation and water exchange in Aniva Bay  
Surface currents in winter are generated by 
dominating northwesterly and northerly winds 
(winter monsoon) that usually push the water level 
away from Aniva Bay.  In autumn, the winter 
monsoon leads to the development of intensive 
southward currents.  Outflow of the surface waters 
from the northern shallow part of the bay initiates 
compensatory reverse flows near the bottom and 
elevation of the sea level at the coast.  At the same 
time, wind-induced flow near the bottom increases 
against the background of the permanent 
thermohaline currents.  On the whole, the winter 
monsoon facilitates development and homogeni-
zation of anticyclonic circulation in the bay.

, respectively), water circulation in 
Aniva Bay is weakly dynamic (January 2002), 
except for the bottom layers in western part of the 
bay with intrusions of the Japan Sea waters (Fig. 
4a, b).  There were nearly no thermohaline 
currents registered in the shallow waters of the 
northern coast (section at 46.32°N);  some stations 
had almost uniform vertical density distribution. 
 
Intensified water circulation in Aniva Bay in 
spring-summer coincides with intensification of 
the Soya Current and increasing contribution of 
haline factors into the formation of the current 
field.  Precipitation and river discharge intensifies 
stratification in the thermocline and formation of 
coastal fronts.  Vertical exchange weakens and 
horizontal circulation strengthens.  As a result, the 
character and intensity of water exchange between 
the bay and surrounding shelf change as well.  
Coastal jet currents evolve, as a rule, at the surface 
at the periphery of A
1
.  Increasing heterogeneity of 
water stratification in summer and typical 
southeasterly winds transform A
1
;  its area 
diminishes and it splits into several smaller eddies 
(Figs. 2-3, summer 2002). 
 
The other remarkable feature of water dynamics in 
Aniva Bay is that the water exchange is driven 
mainly by meridional flows.  As is seen from the 
vertical sections of a meridional component (V) of 
the velocity across eddy A
1
 at the latitude of 46°N 
(Fig. 4a, c), it is highly variable in both the 
magnitude (maximum values amount to 20-25 cm 
sec
-1
), and direction. 
 
Interannual variability 
It is not possible to evaluate the scale of 
interannual variations of winter circulation in the 
bay, because the only one detailed hydrophysical 
survey (CTD-observations with 1 meter 
resolution) in Aniva Bay was carried out during 
winter (January 2002).  At that time waters in the 
narrow belt along the bay perimeter were the 
coldest ones (up to -1.0 – -1.3° С) as compared to 
the surrounding waters (up to -0.5 – -0.9° С).  A 
new CIL (see Fig. 4b) was registered within this 
zone where the density convection reaches the 
bottom.  Coastal waters are evident as the main 
local source of the CIL in Aniva Bay.  However, 
there were no traces of the previous year’s CIL 
found in deep waters of the bay during the second 
10-day period of January 2002 as well.  Hence, it 
might be concluded that complete renewal of the 
previous year’s CIL was completed at the end of 
2001. 
 
Using January 2002 data, water salinity maps of 
the surface and near-bottom waters demonstrate 
only the general features of winter haline 
conditions in Aniva Bay (Fig. 4e).  Waters of the 
prevalent East Sakhalin Current (ESC) initiated 
intensive freshening of the whole water mass (up 
to 31.35-31.40 psu at the surface and 31.40-32.50 
psu – near the bottom) from autumn to winter.  
Winter conditions are distinguished by the absence 
of the 32.5 psu isoline within the bay basin.  Such 
a significant freshening of the whole water mass of 
the bay apparently indicates annual complete 
renewal of local waters, rather than their local 
transformation.  Even winter water convection and 
increasing salinity due to formation of ice are not 
able to withstand this tendency. 
 
The range of interannual variations of water 
dynamics in Aniva Bay in early spring (April) is 
much lower than in summer.  In spite of 
significant differences in thermal conditions in 
April 2001, 2002, and 2003, the estimated spatial 
structure of the surface currents was almost the 
same:  the lightest and freshest waters were slowly 
(less than 5-10 cm s
-1
) flowing out from the top of 
the bay (Fig. 3).  In April 2001, the permanent 
current with a northward component was observed 
in the upper 0-50 m layer along 46°N.  This 
current was related to the second (eastern) core of 
eddy A
1
 that was also distinctly traced in the 
pycnocline layer and surface salinity near Cape 
Aniva.  Near the bottom there were traces of 
external shelf waters that entered the coastal zone.  
The presence of such waters was indirectly 
confirmed by the formation of near-bottom fronts 
with high gradients.  For example, there were 
inflows (especially active in April 2002) of the 
Japan Sea waters to the western part of Aniva Bay 
(Fig. 3).

While thermohaline factors (river discharge, 
precipitation, etc.) were becoming more important 
during the warm period of 2001 and 2002, water 
exchange between the bay and the surrounding 
shelf was intensifying with the enhancement of the 
Soya Current and with increase of the sea level 
gradient between the Japan and Okhotsk Seas.  
Summer of 2002 was characterized by active 
water mass exchanges in the surface (20-30 m) 
layer in western Aniva Bay.  Here, the lightest and 
freshest waters were observed to move from the 
coast (Lososi Bay) to the open part of the bay.  
The other area of the summer accumulation of the 
bay waters is the eastern periphery of anticyclonic 
eddy A
1
.  As was mentioned before, the high water 
dynamics are caused by extreme freshening of the 
surface waters.  Figure 3 (Summer 2002) shows 
the resultant coastal fronts associated with the 
intensive southward currents (up to 20-30 cm s
-1
).  
In summer of 2001 and 2002 water masses near 
the bottom were transported mainly northward, 
that is deep into the bay.  However, the spatial 
structure of bottom currents in summer of 2001 
was rather smooth, while in summer of 2002 it 
was characterized by generation of local eddies 
and increase of current speed (up to 6-10 cm/s vs. 
2 cm s
-1
).  The above differences are due to 
specific weather conditions during the surveys 
(moderate NW-NE winds, 5-10 cm s
-1
) and active 
interaction between the genetically different water 
masses.  Wind effects and mixing of 
heterogeneous water masses caused uneven 
distribution of hydrophysical characteristics (in 
particular, the second additional water density 
jump- Fig. 4f) with associated patchiness of 
currents in Aniva Bay in summer of 2002. 
 
In the beginning of autumn, hydrological 
conditions in the bay were influenced mainly by 
the ESC.  In November 2001 and October 2002, 
the ESC waters entered the bay and spread mainly 
along the eastern periphery of anticyclonic eddy 
A
1
 as a narrow northward stream.  Due to Amur 
River discharge, ESC waters were less saline as 
compared to external shelf waters and highly 
homogeneous as compared to the local waters.  
The most evident intrusion of ESC waters was 
observed at a longitudinal section along 46°N and 
confirmed indirectly by distribution of water 
salinity, water temperature and meridional 
component of current velocity (V) in November 
2001 and October 2002.  According to the sections 
shown in Figure 4d, in October 2002 the ESC 
occupied the whole water column near Cape 
Aniva, and its western edge coincided with 31.7 
psu isohaline.  At the same time, the thermocline 
near the shelf edge (near Cape Aniva) thickened 
and split, accompanied by the upper 
isotherms/isohalines coming to the surface and 
lower isotherms/isohalines deepening.  As a result, 
near-bottom fronts formed.  In autumn 2002, 
horizontal water circulation was represented by 
alongshore currents conditioned on the southward 
discharge current (25 cm s
-1
) in the western part of 
the bay and on northward compensatory flow 
formed by the ESC that enters the bay off Cape 
Aniva (10-25 cm s
-1
).  Maximum speeds were 
registered near the 50 m isobath. An anticyclonic 
eddy A
1
 (5-10 cm s
-1
) was also observed in the 
open part of the bay, westward of 143°E.  The 
outflow of relatively warm surface waters from the 
bay during the autumns of 2001 and 2002 was 
marked in the western part of the bay mainly, near 
the local frontal section.  Compensatory flows, 
mainly N, NW and NE, were registered near the 
bottom, their speed amounting to 2-3 cm s
-1
. 
 
However, due to model restrictions, the current 
fields shown in Figure 3 capture only the general 
description of seasonal and interannual variability 
of water circulation in the bay.  At the same time 
the model calculations are quite adequate in 
reproducing intensification of currents in summer 
and autumn and their weakening in winter, as well 
as the prevalence of meridional flows in the water 
exchange between the bay and external shelf, and 
agree well with observations (Shevchenko et al, 
2004).  
 
Conclusions 
Data from 12 CTD surveys were used to study the 
features of seasonal and interannual variability of 
water structure in Aniva Bay.  Coastal and near-
bottom fronts were found.  As a rule, water 
circulation in the bay has two layers:  surface 
discharge of relatively fresh currents with rather 
high speeds (up to 20-30 cm s
-1
) and slower 
compensatory currents of Okhotsk Sea origin with 
bottom intrusions of Japan Sea waters that spread 
from the west under an anticyclonic eddy A
1
. 
 
 63
The morphometric characteristics of eddy A
1
 and 
the thermal parameters of the CIL change 
considerably within a year, indicating its complete 
annual renewal.  The CIL in Aniva Bay is mainly 
of local origin, caused mainly by convective 
cooling of waters at the northern periphery of A
1
. 
 
Water salinity is greatly determined by river 
discharge, precipitation and intensification of 
ESC.  In late fall (October-December), this current 
causes significant salinity changes in the whole 
water mass of the bay.

Thermal structures of sea surface can be 
determined from the dominant orientations of 
thermal contrasts (DOTC) on IR satellite images.  
Essentially DOTC are the statistically significant 
tangents to the isotherms in the vicinity of a point.  
High correlation of dominant orientations with 
directions of sea surface current velocities and 
their stability during some days makes it possible 
to detect meso-scale eddies from the composition 
of DOTC fields.  In the work presented, a question 
of creating composition of DOTC fields under the 
cloudy conditions of Okhotsk Sea was considered.  
The Kuril region was chosen as the most cloudy 
and dynamic for this purpose.  High coincidence 
between the dominant orientations of thermal 
contrasts and sea surface current directions 
allowed construction of an algorithm for 
automatically detecting eddies and their parameter 
estimation based on an analytic eddy model.  The 
model is characterised parameters that include the 
eddy center location, size, eddy boundaries and 
location of maximum velocity zone.  The work 
was supported by the RFBR grant № 03-01-00812.

Introduction 
Different scientists remark that the formation of 
ozone holes and greenhouse effects can be 
explained by large variations of methane in the 
atmosphere, which is connected with natural 
sources of methane.  Various authors have 
determined that the Sakhalin shelf and the 
Okinawa trough can produce significant intrusions 
of methane during periods of strong seismic 
activity in these regions.  These investigations 
emphasize the importance of methane flux 
research, particularly in seismically active zones. 
 
Experimental research 
Methane distribution in Primorsky region has been 
studied for the last decade.  Averaged data for 
some parts of Primorsky region are demonstrated 
in Table 1.  Averages from various sources 
include:  a) surface fresh waters such as spring 
waters, brooks, sand-pits, lakes and rivers; these 
are practical sources of methane input in 
atmosphere from land;  b) underground water such 
as draw-wells, bore-wells and well-pits that 
characterise the potential of methane input from 
land;  c) marine coastal surface waters.  The 
investigation of methane distribution was done in 
cross-section from Vladivostok to Niigata at 
November 1995 in the Sea of Japan and in 
different regions and seasons for the Sea of 
Okhotsk from 1999-2001.  
 
Discussion 
Table 1 demonstrates the existence of powerful 
sources of methane at Luchegorsk and 
Chernigovka regions but does not demonstrate 
much influence of the Baranovskiy volcano.  One 
can see strong methane supersaturation of fresh 
waters in the Primorsky region. 
 
We observed underwater maximums of methane 
concentration at 50-150 m and 300-600 m depth 
which were formed in Japan Sea areas.  Fall-
winter convection destroyed this maximum at 
stations near Vladivostok.  Methane 
concentrations in surface marine waters were 
under-saturated with atmospheric methane 
concentrations.

Mathematical model for computation of methane 
flux between the Sea of Japan and atmosphere 
was proposed which permitted to take into 
account the influence of bursting bubbles on gas 
exchange.  For the Sea of Okhotsk we observed 
many underwater sources of gas bubble plumes 
on the sea bottom.  These plumes give very 
changeable picture of distribution of methane in 
seawater for different regions and seasons.  Surface 
waters are supersaturated and methane fluxes to the 
atmosphere were from 7 - 90 mol/km

Natural hydrocarbon seeps are found in varying 
intensity along most continental shelves.  These 
seeps emit gas, oil, or a mixture of both from 
seafloor vents.  Free bubbles rise from the sea bed 
into the water column and form a flare.  Bubble 
flares are registered by standard shipboard sonar 
as acoustic anomalies in backscattering and are 
seen as dark curtains on sonar paper chart records 
(Anon. 1988; Leifer and Patro 2002).  Bubble-
mediated transport for a natural hydrocarbon seep 
is a complex process dependent upon many 
parameters.  Some seeps are little more than gentle 
emanation of bubbles from a few vents, while 
others bubble vigorously from dense vent clusters.  
This research seeks to provide the necessary 
theoretical background to allow modeling of gas 
bubble streams and to solve inverse problem of 
evaluation of parameters of gas vents using echo-
sounding data. 
 
A comprehensive review of theory and the basic 
equations governing of bubble mediated gas 
transfer is presented in (Leifer and Patro 2002).  
Unfortunately, the native publications (Ezerskii et 
al. 1989; Goncharov and Klement’eva 1996; 
Maksimov 1998) are absent in this review.  Seep 
bubbles are often observed escaping from the 
seabed as a stream of nearly pure CH
4
 bubbles.  
Bubble CH
4
 is highly supersaturated with respect 
to the bulk ocean and rapidly outflows from the 
bubble, causing bubble dissolution.  The mass 
flow for any gas (CH

, N
2
 and O
2
) is described by 
(Ezerskii et al. 1989; Leifer and Patro 2002)

 now together define the vertical motion of 
the bubble, and its change in radius and 
composition with time.  Using these equations the 
occurrence of anomalies in concentrations of gas 
inclusions can be predicted.  The inhomogeneity 
of bubble rise velocity with depth results in that 
the growth of bubble concentration occurs at the 
horizon with minimal velocity.  One can draw a 
close analogy to the effect, arising in the theory of 
transport flows, when at braking “car-jam” occurs 
and, on the contrary, at acceleration decreasing of 
concentration takes place.

Since the bubble radius, and as a consequence of 
Eq. (4), the terminal rise velocity depend on the 
depth, it appears that bubble concentration is quite 
inhomogeneous with depth.  The form of solution 
(Eq. 11) can be obtained directly from the kinetic 
equation (Eq. 7).  Integrating the both terms of Eq. 
(7) over ' R within the limits, where the sharp 
distribution function is negligibly small, we obtain 
zero from the second term and the condition of 
constancy of the vertical flow from the first term.  
Since the rise velocity is proportional to

find that solution may be written in the form (Eq.

, and correspondingly the 
rise velocity decreases monotonically.  As a result, 
bubble concentration will increase, as bubbles 
approach the stopping horizon in accordance with 
classical “car-jam” effect.  Power singularity in 
Eq. (12) will not be realized in reality as the 
solution is to remain finite.  Really, as the rise 
velocity decreases to a value comparable with 
random (turbulent) pulsation, one should account 
additional (diffusion-like) terms (Maksimov and 
Sosedko 2001) in the kinetic equation (6), which 
will lead to smoothing this singularity.

Current methods of interpreting echo-sounding

example [1]), makes it difficult to evaluate the 
parameters of gas vents on the basis of data from 
acoustical echo-sounding.  As it follows from this 
study, an attempt to maintain direct relations 
between the measured bubble population and one 
emitted by a vent can lead to significant mistakes.

Introduction 
The atmosphere is an intensive and constant 
source of various substances for the ocean.  In the 
northwestern part of the Pacific Ocean, westerly 
winds play a large role in carrying atmospheric 
aerosol particles over large distances.  In 
Primorsky Krai (Vladivostok City), yellow dust is 
observed not only with arrival of a spring, but also 
in the winter as strong westerly winds bring 
particles of a dust from Asia.  The materials 
deposited include both natural and polluting 
substances. 
 
Aerosols define not only the chemical structure, 
but also the optical properties of the atmosphere 
and consequently, the thermal and radiating modes 
of the surface of the Earth and World Ocean.  The 
atmospheric inputs can influence primary 
production in the ocean (Prospero 1996; Saydam 
1996).  Certain interrelations between the flows of 
substances in the ocean and aerosol contents in 
atmosphere have been reported (Honjo 1996). 
 
In the present study, some results of analyzing the 
aerosol contents in the Far-East regions of Russia 
are given and some interrelations between 
atmospheric and marine processes are considered. 
 
Experimental research 
The sampling of atmospheric aerosols is carried 
out uniformly at Japanese installations using 
techniques adopted by the international program 
SEAREX (Uematsu et al. 1983).  Besides, rain and 
snow (after melting), river and waste waters were 
sampled in polyethylene bath and then particulate 
and dissolved forms of matter were separated by 
filtration through nuclei filters with pore diameter 
nearly 40 microns.  Element concentrations in 
aerosol, rain, snow, river and waste waters were 
determined by neutron-activation and atomic-
activation methods. 
 
Aerosol sampling stations were located in 
Vladivostok, Okha on the Sakhalin (north part), 
Paratunka on the Kamchatka peninsula (central 
part) and on research vessels in different regions 
of the Russian Far East. 
 
Discussion of results 
We observed that increasing dust concentrations 
usually coincide with increases in elemental 
concentrations.  Elements were separated into five 
groups:  
 
1. Macroelements – Na, Al, Ca, Fe;  
2. Anthropogenic elements – Pb and Zn; 
3. Trace natural elements – Ni and Cu;  
4. Trace pollution elements – Cd and Co; 
5. Very changing pollution element – As.  
 
Increases of the macroelements (e.g. K, Ba, Fe, Al, 
Ca, Na and others) in the atmosphere of 
Vladivostok in the winter-spring period is marked.  
On average, concentrations of microelements in 
atmosphere of Vladivostok are higher than in 
atmosphere of Sapporo (Michoukov et al. 1997). 
 
Table 1 demonstrates the correlation coefficients 
between concentrations of elements in aerosols for 
Vladivostok.  Only Fe is closely correlated with 
dust concentration.  We observed the correlation 
between concentrations of Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn, 
Co, Ni, and Zn.  For samples from Okha (Table 2) 
all elements are negatively correlated with dust 
concentration but closely correlated with each 
other.  This result demonstrates that aerosols are 
influenced by other sources than in Vladivostok. 
 
For aerosols from the Paratunka we observed 
correlations between Mn, Zn, Fe, Co, Pb (Table 
3).  This analysis demonstrates that different 
sources influence on chemical composition of 
aerosols in the Russian Far East.

Conclusions 
The results indicate the formation of atmospheric 
aerosols in the Russian Far East the large influence 
renders global atmospheric carry, which was 
observed in winter-spring period.  In these periods 
occur inputs of an atmospheric dust from regions 
of an Asian continent.

Wind wave fields and swell in the Subarctic Front Zone

The location of the Subarctic Front Zone (SFZ) 
(Anon. 1972) predetermines the distribution of the 
wind-induced wave and swell fields to a 
considerable extent, as the SFZ is situated along 
the route of most of the mid-latitude cyclones and 
parts of typhoons (Polyakova 1999; Terasova 
1971) possessing a turning point (Figs. 1, 2).  The 
largest wind-induced waves and swell develop in 
the southwestern quarter of cyclones.  Cyclone 
trajectories in the northern Pacific are categorized 
according to six types of atmosphere circulation 
(Polyakova 1999).  The main part of cyclones of 
all six types cross the Subarctic Front Zone at 
various angles or travel parallel to it (Fig. 1). 
 
Under the North Western type (NW) of 
atmospheric processes, the cyclones pass along the 
northern boundary of the SFZ generating waves 
over all of its water area, with its southern half 
being the most violent.  The Okhotsk-Aleutian 
type (OA) of synoptic process, during all period of 
its effect via the Okhotsk Depression, generates 
waves in the Subarctic Front Zone.  The 
Latitudinal Aleutian type (LA) occupies the SFZ 
with the ultimate southern periphery of the 
cyclone/storm field, where the largest wind-
induced waves and swell are observed.  The 
southern latitudinal type (SL) is distinctive in that 
the main part of these cyclones pass over the 
whole SFZ.  The Okhotsk-Hawaiian type (OH), 
with its Okhotsk Depression, induces a direct 
influence on the wave formation in the whole 
water area of the SFZ throughout the duration of 
its effect.  The “cyclones over the ocean” type 
(CO) is distinguished by the presence of mainly 
cyclonic vortices, including those over the water 
area of the SFZ, so they make a considerable input 
into the process of the development of the wind 
waves and swell in all its water area.  
 
The wave formation processes change 
considerable during a year, as the intensity of the 
atmosphere circulation effect varies in significant 
bounds with regard to a season.  Especially violent 
atmospheric processes occur in winter:  December 
–February.  During this period, the cyclones reach 
an unusual development, both in depth (to 970-950 
mb), and radius of action (up to 1000 km and 
more).  In this connection, the wind velocity in 
large water areas may reach 15-20 m s
-1
 and more, 
and the wave height, including those in the SFZ 
reach dangerous (>6 m) and elemental (>8 m) 
values.  In winter, under the intensive develop-
ment of cyclones, the wind wave height can reach 
10-12 m and more;  the average period here is 11-
12 s, and the mean length increases to 200-250 m.  
The swell waves decline after the storm in due 
course, but their period and length are increasing.  
As a result, they continue to mix the sea to a depth 
equal to half a wavelength for not less than a day 
after the wind weakens.  When a deep cyclone is 
passing, wave mixing occurs to a depth of 100-125 
m and lasts for not less than two days.  The wind 
waves and swell here develop fully as their fetch is 
not limited in the open ocean.  The wave heights 
of 5% probability (5 waves out of 100 ones are 
equal to or exceed the given value) can reach the 
exclusive development, up to 9 m and more.  The 
swell waves remain for a long time after the 
passage of an intensive storm;  in a day they 
change their height to 6 m and more, in two days – 
3 m and more (Polyakova 1975).  In autumn, from 
September to November, the intensity of 
atmospheric circulation is the same large scale and 
just somewhat yields to a winter one.  Deep 
cyclones are passing, with pressures in the range 
of 990-960 mb, and storm radii up to 1000 km and 
more, with wind velocities of 12-18 m s
-1
 and 
more.  Wind waves and swells of the dangerous

and elemental heights, with corresponding wave 
periods and lengths similar to winter ones and, 
consequently, the depth of the wave mixing in the 
SFZ is not significantly less than in winter.  In 
spring, especially in April – May, the intensity of 
the atmospheric processes sharply decreases, 
compared to autumn.  The depth of cyclones most 
often does not exceed 1000-980 mb, the cyclone 
radius is decreasing, respectively, the storm winds 
are more rare, moderate and even weak ones are 
more often observed.  The field development of 
the wave winds and swell is considerably 
weakening.  Most often, moderate and weak 
waves occur with heights ranging from 1.5 to 3.5 
m, an average period of 3-6 s, and a mean length 
of 15-30 m.  In spring, sometimes there are more 
intensive cyclones, most often in March.  In this 
case, the wave heights can reach the dangerous 
and elemental values, and the depth of mixing 
reaches 100 m and more.  In summer, all 
atmospheric processes are inert. Cyclone depth is 
mostly about 1000 mb, most often it is contoured 
with one, rarely two isobars.  Breezes are gentle 
and moderate, the waves mostly up to 1.5 m.  
Wind mixing is observed in the surface layer. 
Intensive development of the atmospheric 
processes in summer is most often related to the 
passage of typhoons which generate dangerous 
and elemental wave heights.  After the passage of 
a typhoon in the ocean, in particular in the SFZ, 
the waters are mixed to a depth of 100 m and 
more.

Each of 6 types of the atmospheric situations has a 
definite frequency and seasonal motion, so it 
brings its input into the formation of the wind 
wave and swell fields and, consequently, the depth 
of the water mixing in the SFZ (Table 1). 
 
The average monthly frequency of the NW type in 
the cold half of the year varies from 27% to 43%.  
Consequently, not less than 1/3 of each month has 
the North Western type of circulation generating 
wave fields in the Subarctic Front Zone.  After 
storms pass, the swell waves having rested after it, 
also influence the SFZ for not less than two days, 
i.e. they enlarge the continuation of the North 
Western type effect on the SFZ. 
 
The Okhotsk-Aleutian type of atmospheric 
process, as compared to the NW, in late autumn 
and in winter has significantly less frequency 
(11.3-19.7%), so its influence in the SFZ is 
considerably less than that of the NW type. 
 
The Latitudinal-Aleutian type of atmospheric 
circulation, in the period of the intensive 
development has a frequency of 6-21% as a whole;  
even less than the OA type so consequently, its 
total influence on the mixing in the SFZ is less 
than the two previous types.  Nevertheless, they 
have their effect on the formation of the intensive 
wave throughout the whole zone of the Subarctic 
Front, where to it comes the loop of the wind 
waves and swell produced by the cyclones passing 
far to the north. 
 
The Southern Latitudinal type of the atmospheric 
circulation has a non-significant frequency in the 
period of the intensive development of the 
atmospheric processes (0-9%), so the total input of 
the given type into the water mixing processes in 
the SFZ is the least essential, as compared to the 
previous types. 
 
The Okhotsk-Hawaiian type of atmospheric 
processes, as with the Southern Latitudinal type, 
has a non-significant frequency (2-3%) at the 
period of the intensive development of the 
atmospheric processes, and induces a non-
significant influence on the depth of the water 
mixing in the SFZ. 
 
The “cyclones over the ocean” type during the 
period of the intensive development of the 
atmospheric circulation has the frequency from 27 
to 36.1%.  Note that the intensity of this type can 
often be exclusive, especially in winter and 
autumn.  The wave height in the vast water areas 
in the SFZ can reach 10 m and more.  Throughout 
the whole zone of the Subarctic Front, under the 
action of the “cyclones over the ocean” type, it is 
possible the elaboration of the intensively 
developed fields of the wind waves.  After the 
storm, during 2-3 days, the swell waves are

maintained, gradually decreasing to 6 m on the 
first day, 4 m on the second day, and to 2 m on the 
third.  Taking into account the considerable 
frequency, especially in the cold period, often the 
exclusive intensity of the development, we may 
consider that the CO type has a significant 
influence on the formation of the wind wave fields 
in the Subarctic Front Zone. 
 
Thus, to the formation of the wind waves fields in 
the SFZ the largest input is done by the typical 
atmospheric processes of the NW and “cyclones 
over the ocean”, substantially less – by the OA and 
LA ones, insignificantly – SL and OH.  
Nevertheless, all typical situations influence the 
formation of the wind wave fields in the SFZ. 
 
The largest part of the Subarctic Front is located in 
a zone of the intensive wave, which is located in 
the Western Pacific (Fig. 3) (Polyakova and Sugak 
2003), and the proper zone of the intensive rough 
sea is created by the convergence of trajectories of 
cyclones and typhoons to the east of Japan. 
 
Conclusions 
The Subarctic Front Zone in the NW Pacific is 
located in the area of the intensive sea;  
consequently, the depth of the wave mixing here is 
larger than in the ambient waters of the ocean. 
 
The presence of the intensive sea zone is 
predetermined by the effect of convergence of the 
major trajectories of cyclones and typhoons to the 
east of Japan.

Introduction 
Much attention has been drawn to the seasonal 
variability of the Okhotsk Sea currents for the last 
40 years.  The seasonal variability of the currents 
structure all over the Okhotsk Sea is described in 
Darnitskiy and Luchin (1997), Anonymous (1998) 
Luchin (1982, 1987) and Vasiliev and 
Khrapchenkov 1996).  In Darnitsky and Luchin 
(1997), Anonymous (1998) Luchin (1982, 1987), 
the current field is calculated from Sarkisyan’s 
model D1.  Calculations of Luchin (e.g. Darnitsky 
and Luchin 1997; Luchin 1982, 1987) are based 
on the monthly average instrumental water 
temperature and salinity.  In Vailiev and 
Khrapchenko (1996), the modelled water density 
serves the initial data.  The seasonal variability of 
currents in different parts of the Okhotsk Sea is 
described in Budaeva and Makarov (1996a); 
Budaeva and Makarov (1996b) (the Aniva Bay), 
Figurkin (2002) (the western shelf of Kamchatka), 
Figurkin and Zhigalov (1999); Khen et al. (2002) 
(the northern part of the Okhotsk Sea) and 
Budaeva and Makarov (1999); Gruzevich et al.  
(1996) (the Sakhalin shelf).  In most of the cited 
papers the sea currents are calculated over a 
dynamic model.  In Darnitsky and Luchin (1997) 
and PICES (1995) all the general data 
accumulated by 1995 on the seasonal variability of 
the Okhotsk Sea are given.  The present study 
concentrates on the diagnostic calculation of the 
3D current field for June, August, and October 
using the most complete data set. 
 
Data and methods 
The diagnostic baroclinic linear model of 
Sarkisyan D1 (Marchuk and Shaydurov 1979; 
Sarkisyan 1977) is used to currents.  The 
smoothed bottom relief, real density field and 
atmospheric pressure field serve the initial data.  
As the Richardson’s extrapolation is applied 
(Marchuk 1989; Marchuk and Sarkisyan 1979), 
the model equations are determined by the method 
of finite differences with the numeric scheme of 
the second order of accuracy.  Bathymetric data 
were from the 5-minute ETOPO5 grid.  Density 
fields averaged by month were reconstructed using 
data from RODC FERHRI, ODC RIHMI-WDC 
and other Russian oceanographic organizations, 
and data published in the Levitus Atlas (on CD-R) 
(see Rykov 1999).  Atmospheric pressure data 
were taken from monthly average data (1962-
1990) obtained by re-analysis. 
 
Results 
General current scheme   
A branch of the Kuril-Kamchatka Current flows 
through the Fourth Kuril Strait, enters the Okhotsk 
Sea and forms the West Kamchatka Current that 
can be traced to Shelikhov Bay.  A branch, the 
Middle Current, deviates from the West 
Kamchatka Current at 52°N and flows to the 
northwest.  Another branch of West Kamchatka 
Current, the Penzhinskoe Current in Shelikhov 
Bay – deviates at 58°N and causes cyclonic 
circulation in the bay.  The West Kamchatka 
Current then flows to the west along the northern 
coast of the Okhotsk Sea past Kekurniy, 
Babushkin and Zabiyaka bays and transforms into 
Yamskoe Current.  The current structure near the 
northwestern coast of the Okhotsk Sea is 
represented by North Okhotsk Current that can be 
traced from Taunskaya Guba to Shantary Islands. 
Near the islands, a branch of the North Okhotsk 
Current flows to the east and forms the North 
Okhotsk reverse flow and East Sakhalin Current 
(Figs. 1-3). 
 
The East Sakhalin Current flows along the eastern 
Sakhalin coast.  Near the southeast of Cape 
Terpeniya, the current divides into two flows;  one 
of the branches flows to the north and forms East 
Sakhalin reverse flow and another branch flows to 
the northeast and forms the Northeastern Current.  
The latter flows toward the central Kuril islands, 
turns to the south and joins with Kuril-Kamchatka 
Current.  The East Sakhalin Current rounds Cape 
Terpeniya, flows along the southeastern Sakhalin 
coast to the south of Aniva Bay.  Here, the East

Sakhalin Current turns to the east and joins with 
Soya Current.  The latter can be traced in the 
southwestern part of the Okhotsk Sea where it 
reaches Ekaterina Strait and enters the Pacific 
Ocean.  The current structure in the southwestern 
part of the Okhotsk Sea is characterized by a 
number of anticyclonic eddies that change their 
magnitude and location by seasons (Figs. 1-3). 
 
Seasonal variability 
The West Kamchatka Current is seen in all three 
current schemes.  It is generated by the Kamchatka 
Current flowing into the Okhotsk Sea through the 
Fourth Kuril Strait.  The current velocity is 7-10 
cm s
-1
, and it can be traced to a depth of 100 m.  
The velocity of the northward flow amounts to 10 
cm s
-1
 at the surface.  The cyclonic ring in 
Shelikhov Bay occurs only in August;  its velocity 
ranging from 4 to 7 cm s
-1
.  At the same time, the 
October scheme points to a cyclonic eddy to the 
west of Kamchatka with its center at 56°N.  The 
Yamskoe Current is also prominent in October 
with the light flow of 5-6 cm s
-1
.  The North 
Okhotsk Current can be traced in August and 
October (when it is well expressed) with the 
current velocity over a wide area amounting to 10 
cm s
-1
.  In June, the North Okhotsk Current is 
narrow and immediately adjoins the coast.  On the 
contrary, the North Okhotsk reverse flow is readily 
apparent in June.  Both flows form a number of 
cyclonic eddies in the northeastern part of the 
Okhotsk Sea (Figs. 1-3). 
 
In June and August, the East Sakhalin Current 
adjoins the coast and can be seen distinctly near 
the south of Sakhalin Island only.  In October it is 
very well expressed along the eastern Sakhalin 
coast, with current velocities amounting to 12 cm 
s
-1
.  In summer, near Cape Terpeniya, the East 
Sakhalin Current divides into two flows, the East 
Sakhalin reverse flow and the Northeastern 
Current.  The current velocity in the first flow 
amounts to 5 cm s
-1
 in June and 7 cm s
-1
 in August.  
The current velocity in the second flow amounts to 
8 cm s
-1
 in June and 12 cm s
-1
 in August.  To the 
east of Sakhalin Island, the currents form 
 85
anticyclonic circulation.  The Middle Current, 
generated by a branch of the West Kamchatka 
Current, flows into the eddy.  The location of the 
anticyclonic eddy changes by season.  In June, its 
center is located at 53°30’N 146°30’E, while in 
August it is going to the south to 51°30’N 
145°30’E, and in October, to the east to 52°N 
147°E (Figs. 1-3). 
 
The Soya Current can be identified in the surface 
layer in August and October, with current velocity 
amounting to 15 cm s
-1
.  It flows through 
Ekaterina Strait and enters the Pacific Ocean. 
 
The current scheme of the southwestern part of the 
Okhotsk Sea is characterized by anticyclonic 
eddies with depths up to 1,000 m.  Here the 
surface current velocity amounts to 15-30 cm s
-1
 
(Figs. 1-3). 
 
Just as in August, the current structure of the 
central Okhotsk Sea in October is characterized by 
two eddies, cyclonic and anticyclonic.  The latter 
is traced to the depth of 1,000 m.  The anticyclonic 
eddy is located to the east of Cape Aniva, current 
velocity amounting to 10-15 cm s
-1
. 
 
Conclusion 
Water circulation in the southern part of the 
Okhotsk Sea and small and middle bays is 
presented as a number of small eddies that change 
their magnitude and direction by season.  The 
largest eddy occurs above the Deryugin 
depression, but it shifts to the south by autumn.

Simulation of the thermohaline dynamics of the Sea of Okhotsk

A primitive equation sea dynamics model with 
spherical sigma coordinates is presented.  The 
model describes a wide spectrum of sea motion 
including wind currents, tidal waves, and thermo-
haline circulation.  The numerical algorithm of the 
model is based on implicit splitting schemes and 
conservative finite-difference approximations.  
Combination of the implicit splitting schemes and 
special grid approximations increases the model’s 
efficacy that allows one to carry out numerical 
experiments under broad range of input parameters 
and external conditions.  The model is applied for 
the Sea of Okhotsk with space resolution 10′ × 15′ 
with respect to longitude and latitude and 15 
vertical levels.  Sea motion is generated by wind 
stress, heat and salt forcing at the sea surface, and 
tidal oscillations along the Kuril Islands.  
Numerical results for the tidal wave K
1
 and for the 
marine baroclinic currents are presented.  The 
numerical experiments show that the model 
adequately reproduces the structure of the 
hydrological fields of the Sea of Okhotsk. 
 
For the present, there is no appropriate fine 
resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic model 
that describes and forecasts the structure and 
variability of the hydrographic fields in the Sea of 
Okhotsk.  This is related to the difficulty of the 
problem and to the fact that the observational data 
in different years and seasons are frequently 
contradictory. 
 
The main features of the hydrodynamic conditions 
in the Sea of Okhotsk are the following:  
• large depth differences;  
• the presence of a wide northwestern shelf;  
• strong variable winds;  
• large number of straits and strong currents;  
• high tides; 
• and others. 
 
All the things mentioned above highlight 
significant difficulties for modeling and 
forecasting currents in the Sea of Okhotsk.  In 
relation to this, the problem of developing a full 
numerical model of the Sea of Okhotsk, which 
would allow us to take into account all the main 
factors forming the structure and variability of the 
hydrographic fields, becomes realized. 
 
This study is devoted to the solution of this 
problem.  We present a mathematical model of the 
Sea of Okhotsk dynamics based on full (primitive) 
nonlinear equations of the general circulation 
written in a spherical coordinate system.  We use a 
reduced vertical σ-coordinate, related to the 
bottom topography ( ) θ λ, H :
() θ λ
σ
, H
z
= The 
advantage of the σ-system is the possibility to 
describe accurately the vertical structure of the 
computational fields in the shelf zone and 
continental slope as well as the fields in the 
bottom boundary layer.  The numerical algorithm 
is based on the application of implicit schemes for 
splitting with respect to physical processes and 
geometrical variables. 
 
The model of marine circulation is developed on 
the basis of the model of the thermohaline 
circulation in the ocean.  The improvement of the 
model includes an account for the tidal waves, an 
important high energetic component of the 
dynamics in the Sea of Okhotsk. 
 
Several numerical experiments were carried out to 
simulate tidal, wind, and thermohaline currents in 
the Sea of Okhotsk.  Results show that the tidal 
currents possess the maximum energy.  Near the 
eastern coast of Sakhalin Island, the velocity of the 
currents related to the K
1
 wave reaches 30-40 cm 
s
-1
.  The characteristic velocity of the wind 
currents in the upper layer of the sea near the coast 
of Sakhalin Island is of the order of 10 cm s
-1
.  The 
general structure of the K
1
 tidal wave is formed by 
the incident wave from the basin of the Pacific 
Ocean.  The thermohaline and wind effects make 
 87
insignificant the contribution of this tidal wave to 
the dynamics. 
 
The model describes the main currents in the Sea 
of Okhotsk known from the observations and 
numerical calculations by different authors such as 
the West Kamchatka Current, the East Sakhalin 
Current, the East Sakhalin Countercurrent, the 
Soya Current, and the cyclonic gyre in 
Penzhinskaya Bay.

A stringent mathematical model is proposed for 
calculation of the electromagnetic field of ultra 
low and low frequencies propagating within a 
typhoon area.  The electro-magnetic zone of 
typhoon is shown to be like imaginable ellipsoidal 
dielectric lens with severe absorption of the 
electromagnetic waves. 
 
Long and short axes of ellipsoid vary within a few 
hundred kilometers of width and up to12-15 km 
height.  The wave equation can be such 
mathematical model that satisfactorily interprets 
the process of propagation of electromagnetic 
waves in typhoon zone.  The results of ULF (ultra 
low frequency) calculation at 8, 20 Hz and 15 kHz 
are presented. 
 
The work under question considers the theoretical 
results and compares them with the experimental 
dimensions acquired from Intercosmos satellites 
by researchers of IZAMIRAN (Troitsk, Moscow 
region).  The mathematical model is offered for 
determination of coordinates of electrical 
discharges (lightnings, thunderstorm) generated by 
clouds in the zone of typhoons.  Dense cloudiness, 
heavy meteorological conditions in typhoon zone 
make difficult the research of natural place and 
coordinates of the thunderstorms formation 
directly on the Earth surface. 
 
One of the available methods of investigation of 
thunderstorm formation can be measuring 
electromagnetic waves from the satellites or 
aircrafts.  The mathematical model offered to 
determine the coordinates of electrical discharges 
as integral equations is under consideration.  As 
initial data there is proposed to apply the results of 
experimental measurements of modul and phase of 
electric field of electro-magnetic waves on 
trajectory of moving satellite or aircraft.  It is 
supposed that computation using integral of 
estimated measured field and Green’ s function of 
wave equation admit to identify approximate 
coordinates of certain medium.

Aperture Radar to Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar

Monitoring the formation, development, melting, 
concentration, thickness, movement and other 
parameters of ice in the Okhotsk Sea is vital 
importance to physical oceanographers to study 
regional climate changes, air/sea/ice interaction, 
and formation of ocean water properties.  
Information about sea ice is used also in activities 
associated with transportation, fishing, disaster 
mitigation and commercial development in the 
Okhotsk Sea.  
 
In 1983-2000 data on ice cover of the Okhotsk Sea 
were obtained by Side-Looking Real Aperture 
Radar (RAR) installed on Kosmos-1500, -1766 
and Okean series satellites.  RAR operates at the 
wavelength l = 3.15 cm at vertical polarization. A 
swath width DL = 450 km at a ground resolution 
Dl = 1-3 km (Mitnik and Viktorov 1990).  
 
Detailed regional ice mapping can be carried out 
with the high resolution (10-150 m) satellite 
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).  SARs were 
installed on ERS-1, ERS-2, JERS, Radarsat and 
Envisat satellites.  A swath width of these SARs 
varied from several tens to about 400 km with the 
Dl decreases with the increase of DL.  A great 
body of ERS-1/2 SAR data on ice cover of the 
southwestern Okhotsk Sea was obtained since 
1992.  Other areas of the sea are beyond the sight 
of the ground receiving stations in Hatoyama and 
Beijing. ERS-1/2 SAR operates at the wavelength 
l = 5.6 cm at vertical polarization.  A swath width 
DL = 100 km at a ground resolution Dl = 25 m.  
Now SAR sensing continues from ERS-2.  
Information on ice cover for the whole Okhotsk 
Sea can be obtained with the Advanced Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (ASAR) installed on Envisat.  
ASAR operates at the wavelength l = 5.6 cm at 
vertical (V) or horizontal (H) or cross polarization.  
A swath width DL = 100-405 km at a ground 
resolution Dl = 25-150 m.  The first ASAR images 
of the Okhotsk Sea ice cover were taken in 
December-March 2003.  
 
The radar images permit monitoring of the 
formation and transformation of the ice cover, 
provide information on the ice type, concentration, 
roughness, floe size and velocity under the 
influence of winds and currents.  Below the 
images of the Okhotsk Sea ice cover obtained by 
Okean-7 RAR, ERS-2 SAR and Envisat ASAR are 
considered.  They are analyzed and interpreted 
with the usage of supplementary satellite (NOAA 
AVHRR) and meteorological (weather maps) 
information.  The brightness pattern of a radar 
image is determined by the variations of the 
normalized radar cross section (NRCS).  It is 
assumed that the backscatter from the snow/ice 
cover is dominated by surface scattering which is 
related to the dielectric constant and temperature 
of the ice as well as depending on conditions of ice 
formation.  Dielectric characteristics changed with 
the change of ice age, snow humidity, depth, and 
salinity, etc. (Carsey 1992).  The values of he 
NRCS depend on the wavelength and polarization 
of radar signals and on an incidence angle.  Sea ice 
is observed against the background (open sea 
surface) brightness of which is determined by 
wind speed and direction.  As a result the sea ice 
can look both brighter and darker relative to the 
open sea surface.  Radar contrasts are enhanced in 
the marginal ice zone on account of the great 
difference in the scattering properties of pancake 
ice and grease ice.  The letter possesses by a high 
viscosity that damps the small-scale surface 
waves.  The areas covered by the grease ice look 
dark since backscatter decreases sharply from the 
smooth sea surface.  In contrast, the pancake ice is 
characterized by enhanced backscatter because of 
abundant roughness.  The marginal ice zone is 
very dynamic.  Different regular motions were 
registered in this zone such as ice bands and jets,
 90
ice edge waves, eddies and chains of eddies, 
mushroom-like structures with dimensions ranging 
between several and 100-120 km. 
 
Although the Okhotsk Sea is geographically 
located at temperate latitudes, it has many 
characteristics of a polar ocean.  The first ice in 
the Okhotsk Sea appears at the end of October-
beginning of November in the western and north-
eastern regions of the sea.  Cold air from the East 
Siberia produces sea ice in the Okhotsk Sea and at 
the same time pushes away the new ice from a 
coast.  Such conditions maintain the coastal 
polynya and formation of thin ice which are the 
characteristic features in the northern part of the 
Okhotsk Sea and along the Sakhalin.  After two 
months the ice on the northern half of sea connects 
into ice massif and drifts southward filling its 
central part.  Coastal polynyas were frequently 
observed in the Aniva and Terpenya bays.  Eddies 
along the Sakhalin coast and off Hokkaido were 
also detected.  The maximum ice extent occurs in 
mid-March and thereafter the ice extent retreats 
and all ice disappears by the beginning of June.   
 
The Okhotsk Sea ice occurs as fast ice and pack 
ice.  Fast ice lies in the coastal area;  the estimated 
mean maximum annual ice thickness distributes 
geographically from 0.4 to 1.1 m.  The pack ice is 
of dynamic nature, driven by winds and currents.  
The drift speed of ice is as much as 35 km/day on 
average in coastal regions off Sakhalin and 
Hokkaido. 
 
RAR images 
Two Okean-7 RAR images covering the eastern 
Okhotsk Sea and Kamchatka are depicted in 
Figure 1.  Strong north- and northwestward winds 
(15-17 m/s) were observed over the Eastern 
Okhotsk Sea as follows from the weather map for 
February 5, 2000 at 12 UTC and confirmed by 
orientation of wind shadows on RAR image (Fig. 
1a).  This synoptic situation manifests itself as the 
light area with cyclonic bend where the imprints of 
convective rolls stretched along wind direction are 
clearly visible.  A narrow band of the sea ice 
which is adjacent to the Kamchatka coast has a 
darker tone compare to the wind-roughened open 
sea surface.  It is especially true for an outer part 
of the band which is characterized by the 
minimum brightness likely due to the presence of 
grease ice.  Its width is about 6 km.  Ice zone 
broadens west of the southern Kamchatka coast 
where wind speed weakens.  Upwind side of the 
ice zone has the increased backscatter due to likely 
the decrease of the of pancake ice size.  
 
Fig. 1 Okean-7 RAR images for February 5 at 
10:47 UTC (a) and February 8 (b) 2000 at 10:47 
UTC showing fast growth of the ice cover in the 
Northern Okhotsk Sea, near Kamchatka coast and 
south of Paramushir. 
 
In three days cold air advection in the eastern 
Okhotsk Sea significantly decreased and the zone 
with strong winds moved to the west (Fig. 1b).  
Dark tone of the open sea surface points to low 
wind speed due to the low air pressure gradients.  
An area of ice cover distinctly increased.  At the 
northern part of the image the ice edge moved far 
to the south.  Formation of ice continues to the 
south of Koni Peninsula where there are several 
bright patches which consist very likely of
 91
pancake ice.  The sea ice area along the southern 
Kamchatka coast as well as near Lopatka Cape 
and to the south of Paramushir also markedly 
increased.  To the south of a dark line in Figure 1, 
the increase is estimated as 15000 km
2
.  As 
follows from the surface analysis and wind and 
wave analysis maps it was happen for the most 
part between February 5 and 6 when strong cold 
air outbreak was observed.  Then the location of 
ice edge changed modestly.  The vast and giant ice 
floes (bright patches) are visible on both RAR 
images.  However it is difficult to identify the 
same giant floes on two images in three days.  
Severe weather conditions produced the change 
not only floe’s location but their NRCS as well. 
 
SAR images 
Detailed ice mapping of the area between 
Southern Sakhalin and Hokkaido as well as 
Sakhalin and Kamchatka coastal zones can be 
carried out with a SAR installed on ERS-2 and 
Envisat satellites.  The ice conditions in the Aniva 
Bay are reliably identified on numerous ERS-1/2 
SAR images obtained in 1992-2003.  Their 
boundaries are shown in Figure 2.

polarization for December 9, 2002, at 12:11 UTC. 
 
ERS-2 SAR images for January 24, 2000 at 01:17 
UTC (Fig. 3a) were acquired when strong 
northwestward winds blew over the Bay.  As a 
result the open sea surface has a light tone on the 
image.  The stretched features show wind 
direction.  Sea ice is observed near the Sakhalin 
coast, in a central part of the Aniva Bay and near 
Hokkaido.  Dark belts of variable width adjacent 
to an ice massif in the central part of Aniva Bay 
are grease ice.  They are located upwind and 
visualize the area of intensive ice formation.  The 
area of the grease ice is estimated as 700 km
2
.  
Other types of sea ice (nilas, young ice, grey ice, 
gray-white ice) which were formed in the Aniva 
Bay or somewhere northeast Sakhalin and drifted 
to the south have a grey tone on the SAR image.  
 
Sea ice serves a tracer of sea surface circulation 
when strong winds are absent.  The ERS-2 SAR 
image for March 3, 2002 of the area between 
Sakhalin and Hokkaido (Fig. 3b) shows the eddy-
like and mushroom-like structures.  It is evident 
that NOAA AVHRR image acquired at the same 
day (Fig. 3c) gives only an approximate estimate 
of sea ice distribution.  Dark rectangle marks the 
boundaries of the SAR image. 
 
Envisat ASAR image for March 9, 2002 at 12:11 
UTC (Fig. 4) visualized the areas of new ice 
formation under strong cold air flow.  According 
to the surface analysis map, air temperature at the 
coastal stations changed from -24 to -20°C.  The 
stretched bands of the variable brightness crossing 
the image from the northwest to the southeast are 
due to the sea surface wind.  The differences in the 
brightness (in the values of the NRCS) are caused 
by the effect of coastal orography.  Ice is 
generated both near the coast and in the open sea. 
The ice drifts from the coast and forms bands 
extended in wind direction.  In the open sea the 
areas of grease ice and pancake ice are estimated 
as 1600 and 3100 km
2
, respectively. 
Transformation of grease ice in pancake ice is fast 
enough under the particular weather conditions.  
These two types of ice development are visible 
very clearly due to high radar contrast between 
them.  The sea ice is also well distinguished in the 
Sakhalin Bay (in its western and southern parts), 
Amursky Liman, along the eastern Sakhalin coast 
and in Tatarsky Bay.

Meteorological and oceanic characteristics of the 
Okhotsk Sea are close to those of the polar ocean.  
They include severe winters with low air 
temperature and enhanced cyclone activity, 
extended period of ice cover, etc.  Gale winds 
accompanying cyclones and convective 
atmospheric vortices significantly influence the 
formation, development of ice cover, and the 
position and structure of the ice edge.  From this 
follows the need of gaining operational 
information about ice cover and surface wind 
characteristics.  In turn, this information is 
essential for solving scientific problems, in 
particular those involving ice margin processes 
(water mass formation, oceanic upwelling, eddy 
formation, etc.), synoptic and mesoscale processes 
in the atmosphere including instability generation, 
air-sea-ice interaction. 
 
Only space measurements can provide a pattern of 
ice distribution over the whole sea practically at a 
single moment.  Continuous monitoring of ice 
cover is impossible with satellite visible and IR 
data only.  NOAA AVHRR visible and IR images 
have the spatial resolution of about 1 x 1 km, 
however, cloudiness limits the possibilities of 
surveying.  Low brightness and thermal contrasts 
also hinder application of the AVHRR data except 
for grease ice and dark nilas.  
 
Substantial progress can be made toward solving 
this problem by using the microwave passive 
(radiometric) and active (radar) data due to weak 
influence of weather conditions and the 
possibilities of estimating both ice and 
oceanic/atmospheric characteristics.  Satellite 
passive microwave systems provide low resolution 
information but with good spatial and temporal 
coverage independently on cloudiness and sun 
illumination.  This information is used for global 
and regional climate studies.  In particular, 
Nimbus SMMR and DMSP SSM/I data were used 
to reveal the relationship between SMM/I-derived 
sea ice extents of the Bering and Okhotsk seas and 
atmospheric circulation, to relate ice cover with 
oceanic processes, etc.  Ice concentration data 
were used to estimate the production rates of ice, 
salt and dense shelf water in polynyas over the 
Kashevarova Bank and over the northwest 
continental shelf.  Cold air from the East Siberia 
produces sea ice in the Okhotsk Sea and at the 
same time pushes away the new ice from a coast.  
Such conditions maintain the coastal polynyas and 
formation of thin ice which are the characteristic 
features in the northern part of the Okhotsk Sea 
and along the Sakhalin.  SSM/I-derived evidence 
on thin ice area fluctuations is important for 
estimates of heat flux, sea ice productivity and 
formation of saline water.  Young ice is mapped 
using Polarization Ratio (PR) or a scatter plot of 
PR and Gradient Ratio.  The daily fluctuations of 
thin ice area were investigated by making daily ice 
charts.  In the case of advance of ice edge, thin ice 
zone expands. 
 
The surface resolution of the SSM/I DMSP data is 
30 × 30 km at frequency ν = 37.0 GHz or 15 × 15 
km at ν = 85.0 GHz that determines the possible 
error in estimation of the ice edge position, the 
possibilities of studying different scale motions, 
etc.  Aqua and ADEOS-II satellites were launched 
on polar orbits on May 4 and December 14, 2002, 
respectively.  A most important instrument for sea 
ice study is microwave imaging radiometer AMSR 
(Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer).  
AMSR measures outgoing microwave emission of 
the atmosphere-underlying surface system at 
frequencies of 6.6, 10.65, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5 and 89.0 
GHz with the vertical and horizontal polarization.  
The AMSR has wider swath width, higher 
radiometric sensitivity and higher spatial 
resolution as compared with SSM/I.  (For 
example, the pixel size is 10 × 10 km at ν = 36.5 
GHz and 5 × 5 km at ν = of 89 GHz.  The 
 95
increased resolution and the broader swath (more 
frequent coverage) serve as the basis of ice drift 
estimation.  
 
In this report, the main attention is focused on the 
demonstration of the high potential of Aqua 
AMSR-E data for the sea ice study in the Okhotsk 
Sea.  Aqua AMSR-E data for January 25-31, 2003 
were used in our research.  Supplementary 
information included the NOAA AVHRR images, 
weather maps as well as the Envisat Advanced 
Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) images taken in 
December 2002 - February 2003.  The resolution 
of the wide swath (405 km) ASAR images is 150 x 
150 m that allows us to investigate the fine details 
of sea ice distribution. 
 
On January 25-31 the weather conditions in the 
Okhotsk Sea were determined by the southern 
cyclones.  On January 25-26 strong northwestern 
winds were observed almost over the whole sea.  
Wind speed reached 15-20 m s
-1
 in the Kuril straits 
area.  Cloud streets which are typical for a cold 
outbreak extended over the most of the sea as 
follows from AVHRR visible image for January 
26 at 02:26 UTC.  Clouds hinder to detect the sea 
ice in the eastern Okhotsk Sea as opposite to the 
western and centrals parts where cold advection 
was no so intensive, cloud rolls were rear and the 
sea surface was distinctly seen.  Different types of 
ice and ice-free space in the area of Kashevarova 
Bank were well distinguished.  In the northern 
Okhotsk Sea and along eastern Sakhalin coast 
where winds were weak and clouds were absent, 
the differences between young (dark) and snow-
covered (bright) ice as well as the ice eddies 
between Sakhalin and Hokkaido were reliably 
detected.  The young ice area in Terpeniya Bay 
broadened during January 25-26.  The features of 
ice cover in the fields of brightness temperatures 
measured by AMSR-E on descending and 
ascending Aqua orbits were in a good agreement 
with the AVHRR visible image.  
 
On January 27, zone of northwestern winds shifted 
to the eastern part of the Okhotsk Sea and in the 
west Okhotsk Sea winds were weak as follows 
from the surface analysis maps at 00, 06 and 12 
UTC.  However the western and northern parts of 
the sea were left under the action of a cold 
outbreak to the rear of a deep cyclone located to 
the south of Aleutian Islands according to the 
surface analysis map for January 27 at 00 UTC.  
The sea ice near the eastern and southern Sakhalin 
became poorly distinguished on the AVHRR 
visible image for January 27 at 5:38 UTC (Fig. 1) 
due to displacement of the cloudiness associated 
with the cold front and cyclone.  The marginal ice 
zone and the features of sea ice distribution in the 
area of Kashevarova Bank were observed very 
clearly.  The AMSR-E data covered only the 
western Okhotsk Sea.  The microwave 
observations fit the AVHRR visible image 
reasonably well. 
 
 
Fig. 1 NOAA AVHRR visible image for 
January 27, 2003, at 5:38 UTC. 
 
On January 28 and during the first half of January 
29 the cyclone moved to the Okhotsk Sea across 
Sakhalin.  The winds were southeastward in the 
Southern Okhotsk Sea and east- and northeastward 
in the northern part of the sea.  Wind speed 
reached 15-20 m s
-1
.  Coincidence of cyclonic 
circulation with the outlines of the coastline was 
 96
favorable to the wind speed increase in the 
northern Okhotsk Sea.  The center of the cyclone 
on the AVHRR visible image for January 29 was 
in the center of convergence of cloud spirals.  
Cloud rows extended along the Northern Okhotsk 
Sea.  The heavy clouds impeded the observations 
of sea ice.  Application of microwave 
measurements is of a special value under 
cloudiness and gall winds when the ice edge 
position and polynyas’ area changed rapidly.

The TBs variations over the sea are due to the 
differences in the sea ice properties and 
concentration as well as due to the variations in 
the total cloud liquid water content Q.  In 
particular, a broad arc-like band over the ice-free 
waters is the cloud band cyclone.  The similar 
features are reliably detected by using spectral and 
polarization differences.  The corresponding 
examples are given in the paper.  
 
Comparison of AVHRR visible images taken on 
January 29 and 30 shows the further development 
of the synoptic processes.  The cyclone to the east 
of Sakhalin began to occlude as follows from the 
image for January 30.  A cold front which was 
located over the central Okhotsk Sea shifted fast to 
the east.  Strong southwestward winds associated 
with the occlusion front continued in the 
northwestern Okhotsk Sea. At the same time, the 
gale winds caused by the cold front moved to the 
southeastern part of the sea.  Weak winds were 
observed over the Sakhalin shelf.  On January 29, 
ice edge was clearly visible to the east of southern 
Sakhalin.  On January 30, in spite of cloudiness, 
almost all ice was covered by clouds.  Aqua 
AMSR-E measurements gave an estimate of sea 
ice pattern (Fig. 3a).  
 
On January 31, the whole Okhotsk Sea was in the 
rear of a deep cyclone which displaced to the 
northeast in the Bering Sea (Fig. 4).  As a result 
the gale northern and northwestern winds were 
observed over the whole Okhotsk Sea excepting 
its northern coast where winds blew from 
northeast.  Gale winds were favorable for to push 
ice away from Terpeniya Bay as follows from 
visible images for January 30 and 31 and 
confirmed by AMSR-E data.  The TBS fields over 
the sea ice were also used to estimate the ice drift 
by application of multiple cross-correlation 
technique.  Ice cover development in December 
2002 and February 2003 was traced by analysis of 
Envisat ASAR images.

Warm saline waters of the Japan Sea flow into the 
Japan Sea through the La Perouse (Soya) Strait.  
These waters control the important features of the 
oceanographic regime of the whole Sakhalin-Kuril 
region.  In spite of this fact, the dynamic 
phenomena and processes in the strait, in 
particular, the exchange of waters between the 
Japan and Okhotsk Seas have not been adequately 
studied.  A primary consideration is small amount 
of long-term current measurements in the strait.  
Recent observations carried out in the La Perouse 
Strait and to the east of it improved the situation.  
Analysis of experimental data allows us to 
determine total flow velocity and its seasonal 
variations as well as the current variations in the 
strait caused by tides and winds.  
 
At the same time many other questions remains to 
be answered.  They are in particular associated 
with comprehensive study of spatial and temporal 
variability of the water exchange, structure of 
current field, penetration of the Okhotsk Sea 
waters into the Japan Sea caused by tidal flows 
and displacement of low pressure atmospheric 
systems.  The usage of surface analysis maps and 
NOAA AVHRR images helps to interpret the 
features of current measurements.  The weather 
maps show the location of cyclones, their 
trajectories, the values of surface pressure, wind 
speed and direction.  The AVHRR infrared (IR) 
images or AVHRR-derived fields of SST provide 
a rough idea of the position of the different water 
masses and boundaries dividing them.  
Interference caused by clouds and inadequate 
spatial resolution of the AVHRR hinder the 
oceanic phenomena study.  Moreover, the 
phenomena with minor thermal contrast or with 
the size under several hundred meters cannot be 
detected by an AVHRR.  Application of satellite 
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images in 
combination with other satellite and in situ 
observations allows us to study the submesoscale 
and fine scale features of the oceanic processes 
independently on cloudiness since the cloudy 
atmosphere is practically transparent for C-band 
radar signals and a ground resolution is 25 × 25 m.  
 
SAR sensing of the La Perouse (Soya) Strait was 
carried out from ERS-1 and ERS-2 with C-band 
SAR.  The SAR imagery was mainly obtained 
when the satellites were in 35-day exact repeat 
orbits, which precludes short-term temporal 
sampling.  The position of two ERS-1/2 images 
covering the strait on descending track 260 is 
shown in Figure 1.  The size of an image is about 
100 × 100 km and a spatial resolution is 25 × 25 
m.  The first ERS-1 SAR image of the strait was 
taken on April 15, 1992 and the last one - on April 
12, 1996.  The first SAR image from ERS-2 was 
taken on July 12, 1997 and the last one was taken 
on April 12, 2003.  Observations from ERS-2 
continue.  
 
Information collected in the European Space 
Agency (ESA) was screened to estimate the dates 
and time of the individual SAR images.  The 
results of this screening are given below.  More 
than 150 images were taken from ERS-1 and ERS-
2.  All images of the La Perouse (Soya) Strait 
presented on the web sites of ground stations and 
the ESA were downloaded.  They represent the so 
named quick look (QL) images having the reduced 
spatial and radiometric resolution and thus we 
were able to detect only high -contrast cases.  The 
cases with low-level radar signatures were missed.  
One precision (PRI) high-resolution ERS-2 SAR 
images was ordered at the ESA to carry out the 
detailed study of the surface manifestations of the 
oceanic phenomena.  
 
 99
The SAR images were used to verify hypotheses 
for tidal nature of the cold waters near the western 
coast of Cape Krilion.  These cold waters are 
regularly observed on IR images obtained by 
AVHRR (ground resolution Dl = 1.1 km) from 
NOAA satellite as well as by IR sensors from 
Meteor_Priroda (Dl = 250 m) and Landsat (Dl = 
120 m) satellites.  The cold waters are traced from 
Cape Krilion.  It forms a cold belt parallel to the 
Soya Warm Current (see Danchenkov et al. 1999 
and references cited in it).  Figure 2 shows SST 
pattern in the area under study on MSU-SK and 
Landsat-5 images.  The main features of the SST 
field are the cold waters 1 to the west of Krilion 
Cape, Soya Warm Current 2 along the Hokkaido 
coast and a narrow belt of cold water 3 adjointing 
to the current.  They are considered in detail by 
Mitnik et al. (2002).  
 
To verify the tidal hypotheses all 75 SAR strips 
were screened to detect the presence or absence of 
the oceanic fronts to the west of Krilion Cape.  
The radar signatures in a form of the light 
curvilinear bands were detected on 19 strips.  No 
features to the west of Cape Krilion were found on 
other 56 strips.  On these strips, the signatures 
were absent or observed in other places such as to 
the east of Cape Krilion and/or near the Hokkaido 
coast.  Fourteen strips were taken at a period when 
mooring stations measured currents in the strait at 
a point shown in Figure 1 (Kantakov and 
Shevchenko, 2001).

Instrumental current measurements were analyzed 
for several cases both when the frontal zones were 
detected and when they were not detected on ERS 
SAR images.  It has been established that the 
presence of the fronts to the west of Cape Krilion 
corresponds to such tidal phases when tidal flow 
was directed from the Okhotsk Sea into the Japan 
Sea.  Typical example is shown in Figure 3a.  
ERS-2 SAR image of the La Perouse (Soya) Strait 
was acquired on August 5, 2000, under favorable 
weather conditions:  wind speed varied in the 
range of 3-6 m/s.  The cold waters near Cape 
Krilion and to the southeast of it look darker than 
the background ones.  The frontal boundaries in a 
form of narrow light bands caused by the 
increased sea surface roughness separate them 
from the surrounding warmer waters.  These 
boundaries are detected both to the west of Cape 
Krilion in the Japan Sea and to the east of the 
Cape in Aniva Bay.  The boundaries coincide with 
thermal contrasts on NOAA-derived SST field 
(not shown).  The image was taken at 01:20 UTC 
at the instant a flood phase was almost finished 
and shows the approximate boundary of cold 
water penetration in response to tidal flow.  East-
directed (u) and north-directed (v) current 
components at the depth of 40 m measured by 
Clione mooring in the middle of La Perouse 
(Soya) Strait (Fig. 1) and the predicted tidal 
currents at the depth of 15 m on August 4-5, 2000, 
are shown in Figure 3b, c.  Dot and dash line 
corresponds to the moment of ERS-2 SAR 
sensing. 
 
The similar radar signatures were observed on the 
SAR images taken at 260 track on October 7, 
1992, July 14 and August 18, 1993, August 11 
1995, September 20, 1997, October 10, 1998, 
August 21, 1999, September 9, 2000, August 25, 
2001, etc.  The SST patterns on the AVHRR IR 
cloudless images correlated with the SAR features.  
 
When direction of tidal flow coincided with the 
general flow the frontal zones to the west of 
Krilion Cape were absent on the SAR images.  At 
the same time they were detected east and south of 
the cape.  Figure 4 illustrates a situation when 
general flow was directed to the east and tidal flow 
was weak as follows from Clione measurements. 
The frontal zone in a form of light curvilinear line 
is clearly visible on ERS-2 SAR image for June 
12, 1999 at 01:20 UTC.

Velocity of tidal current in the La Perouse (Soya) 
Strait is high.  Under definite astronomical 
conditions, surface current velocity at the centre of 
the strait can reach 3 m s
-1
.  Flood tide can 
overcome main flow of the SWC.  It is especially 
true for the northern part of the strait where 
general flow weakens flood tide and the flood tide 
increases due to the increase of meridional 
components.  According to the computations up to 
100 km
3
 of water can be transported from the 
Okhotsk Sea into the Japan Sea and back during a 
tidal cycle.  The volume should be decreased to 
40-50 km
3
 if take into account the counteraction 
by the SWC.  Cold waters from the Okhotsk Sea 
enter largely through the northern part of the strait 
northwestward.  These conclusions are in a good 
agreement with the results of analysis of satellite 
SAR and IR observations.

Multi-year observations (by Japan and the Russian 
Pacific Oceanological Institute) of intermediate 
water masses in the Kuril Islands zone and 
adjacent areas formed the basis of this study.  It 
was found that in the Okhotsk Sea along the Kuril 
Islands, there is an abrupt “end” of the cold 
intermediate layer core (minimum <1°C at a 
distance of 40-60 miles from the islands coast 
(Fig. 1a).  The abrupt “end” of the cold 
intermediate layer is evidence of the existence of a 
clear division of intermediate water of the Okhotsk 
Sea and the transformed waters in the tidally 
mixed straits.  The cold intermediate layer in the 
Okhotsk Sea is not connected with the same in 
Oyashio Current and is identified by winter 
temperature conditions in the region. 
 
The hydrological structure of water in the straits is 
more complicated than was believed earlier.  First, 
the transformation of water in the straits is 
exposed differently.  Water with intrinsic signs of 
Kuril-type subarctic structure is observed mainly 
on the shelf of the Kuril islands where tidal mixing 
is more evident.  In the shallow water zone, tidal 
transformation results in the formation of a 
vertically homogenous water column.  In the 
deepwater areas of the straits, highly stratified 
waters are observed.  Secondly, the characteristic 
presence of variously scaled non-homogeneous 
structures that are being formed through eddy-
formation and frontogenesis as near-Kuril currents 
touch, on a background of tidal mixing.

Bussol Strait.

As well, alteration of the location of intermediate 
layers boundaries and extremes occurs in the 
thermohaline structure.  In the eddies and also in 
the currents stream, that carry and preserve their 
own parameters, are homogeneous cores of 
minimal temperature in cold intermediate layer.  
Thirdly, the water structure in the area of the 
straits is being corrected by the changeability of 
the water that is exchanged in the straits.  In every 
major Kuril strait, depending on the annual 
development of any link of current systems in the 
region, there is possibility of both a dominant 
outflow of Okhotsk Sea water, a dominant inflow 
the Pacific Ocean water or bidirectional water 
circulation.  The thermohaline water structure 
scheme in Bussol Strait is shown in Figure 1b. 
 
In the Pacific Ocean, the water of the Kuril 
Current (from the Bussol Strait - the Oyashio 
Current), that is being formed by very cold and 
relatively fresh waters of the east coast of the 
Kamchatka Peninsula and Pacific waters in the 
Kuril Straits zone, mixes with Okhotsk Sea 
transformed water.  This water enters the North 
Pacific Ocean as a prototype of North Pacific 
Intermediate Water.

Introduction 
Investigations of water dynamics in Aniva Bay, 
Sea of Okhotsk, located on the southern coast of 
Sakhalin Island have a wide interests ranging from 
sea urchin larval distribution, to fall storm 
influences on scallops, to the offshore structures 
liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant developed near 
Prigorodnoe.  Detailed knowledge of water 
movements is necessary to understand the 
characteristics of extreme current speeds and 
directions in the area.  On other hand, the residual 
current distributions in Aniva Bay help to 
understand how East Sakhalin Current filaments 
and West Sakhalin Current jets interact with the 
nearby La Perouse (Soya) Strait in this semi closed 
bay.  The most intriguing moment was to clarify 
where and how the currents associated with the 
clockwise circulation at depth (up to 105 m) in 
Aniva Bay interact with the anticlockwise 
circulation around Aniva Bay in the nearshore.  
This has been unclear based on the references, but 
recent experimental results with drifters (Oshima 
et al. 2002) and the appearance of juveniles of 
subtropical species in the cold Sea of Okhotsk 
waters inside Aniva Bay and vicinity are providing 
clues.

The knowledge of dynamics processes in Aniva 
Bay is limited by small quantities and short 
durations of direct current measurements.  The 
view of currents inside Aniva Bay is based mainly 
on the results of different numerical models 
(Budaeva and Markarov 1996; Pishchalnik and 
Arkhipkin 1999).  Thus, the need for direct current 
observations in Aniva Bay was required.  
 
Data 
SakhNIRO deployed 5 moorings (Table 1) in the 
fall of 2002.  Two (Inessa 4, Inessa 3) were 
installed close to the coast, one inside Busse 
Lagoon (Inessa 2) and two (Inessa 5, Inessa 6) 
recorded currents at the open southern border of 
Aniva Bay (Fig. 1).  Most moorings were retrieved 
in November 2002 (Table 1).  In the southeastern 
part of Aniva Bay, an Acoustic Doppler 
Profilograf (ADP) was deployed on November 9, 
2002.  It worked for five winter months, mainly 
under ice floes.  At all stations, water temperature 
was measured, coastal stations had also gauges of 
hydrostatic pressure (sea level).  Inessa 4 had the 
ability to measure waves once every 2 hours. 
 
Results and Discussion 
The resulting data were analyzed with statistical 
and spectral analysis techniques. Amplitudes and 
phases of the main diurnal (Q1, O1, P1, K1) and 
semidiurnal (N2, M2, S2, K2) harmonics were 
calculated using a least square method.  Tidal 
currents at all stations had approximately identical 
intensity.  The amplitudes of the basic diurnal 
waves ( К1 and О1) and the main semidiurnal 
constituent ( М2) were about 3-4 cm s
-1
.  Tidal 
currents increased up to 10-15 cm s
-1
 at the station 
Inessa 4, located not far from La Perouse (Soya) 
Strait where tidal currents can reach 5-6 knots 
(Oshima et al. 2002; Shevchenko and Kantakov 
2001).  As a whole, the influence of tides on 
dynamic processes in the Aniva Bay is 
insignificant except in the southeastern part. 
 
At coastal stations Inessa 3 and Inessa 4, an 
intensive residual current of variable direction, 
induced by the wind, was observed.  The maximal 
velocities near the coast reached 30-40 cm s
-1
 
when a deep cyclone (minimal value of atmo-
sphere pressure was 983 millibars) crossed over 
Aniva Bay from October 1-3, 2002.  At station 
Inessa 5, a flow of modified Japan Sea water 
penetrated Aniva Bay during the initial period of 
measurements.  In the middle of October, the 
stream changed to the opposite direction. 
 
At station Inessa 6 the quasi-periodic variations of 
currents were observed caused probably by 
influence of an anticyclonic ring that usually 
occurred in this area (Budaeva and Makarov, 
1996; Pishchalnik and Arkhipkin 1999).  In the 
first decade of October at ashore stations (Inessa 
3,4) were observed intensive inertial currents 
which amplitude reached 20-25 cm s
-1
 (Fig. 2).  
The spectral analysis of current velocity obtained 
 106
at Inessa 6 and Inessa 5 moorings (Fig. 3) showed 
a strong well-expressed peak with period about 
16.6 hours.  This period is very close to the 
Coriolis period at the latitude of Aniva Bay (f = 
12/sin φ = 12/sin46° = 16.68 h).  A polarization of 
current rotation was also found; clockwise motion, 
that is typical to inertial currents, dominated.  In 
contrast to inertial motions, diurnal currents have 
counterclockwise rotation in this area.  A similar 
situation with strong clockwise-rotated inertial 
currents was observed in this area in October 2001 
(Shevchenko et al. 2002). 
 
The cause of intensive inertial currents in Aniva 
Bay is unclear; Aniva Bay seems too small for this 
type of wave.  Probably, they are induced by 
strongly winds that were connected with deep 
cyclone from October 1-3.  Another source of 
inertial motions can be the interaction between a 
low-frequency anticyclonic ring in Aniva Bay and 
the flow of the East Sakhalin Current.

Sea level (bottom hydrostatic pressure) changes 
are shown in Figure 4.  There was a storm surge 
on October 2, mostly manifested in Busse Lagoon 
at the Inessa 2 mooring, probably influenced by 
rain.  Sea level increased at all stations with the 
arrival of relatively warm and low salinity water of 
the East Sakhalin Current in the fall season.  An 
interesting result of this was a sharp increase of 
sea level inside Busse Lagoon.  It means that there 
is ventilation of lagoons (marine water inflow) of 
Sakhalin Island in a fall and winter seasons when 
Okhotsk Sea mean sea level is high (Poezzhalova 
and Shevchenko 1997).  
 
Water temperature changes are shown in Figure 5.  
It is obvious that East Sakhalin Current waters 
reached the Inessa 6 mooring in the middle of

In that time, the cooling of water masses occurred 
in the coastal zone.  A very interesting phenomena 
is the water temperature changes of 2-3°C at 
Inessa 5 mooring under influence of the inertial 
current.  Almost no changes occurred during the 
same period at the Inessa 6 mooring.  Perhaps, the 
cause of this difference is a boundary between 
cold and warm waters close to Inessa 5 mooring.  
 
Near the southeastern coast of Aniva Bay during 
the autumn and winter periods an intensive stream 
directed aside of the deep sea (ADP mooring) was

observed.  Probably, it was caused by the 
influence of a winter monsoon with prevailing 
northwesterly winds.

Introduction 
Northern shelf of the Sea of Okhotsk is the main 
source area of dense water for formation of the 
Sea of Okhotsk Intermediate Water (OSIW).  It is 
generally accepted that shelf waters ventilate sea 
interior.  Oceanographic observations confirm the 
existence of wide area with low salinity and low 
temperature waters on the northern and north - 
western shelf and narrow belt of those east off 
Sakhalin with southward permanent currents along 
the continental slope (Itoh et al 2001; Mizuta et al 
2001).  
 
The density of shelf waters they have during 
wintertime varies from year to year but does not 
exceed 26.7-26.8 σ
t
 in general.  The distribution of 
isopycnal surface of 26.8 σ
t
 in the Sea of Okhotsk 
indicate the average depth of 250-300 meters 
through out the sea and 350-400 meters near the 
Kurile Straits (Gladyshev et al 2000).  The value 
of density of shelf waters is lower than that on 
intermediate depths and is not sufficient for 
ventilation of deep sea by the isopycnal transport.  
Numerous attempts to find water as dense as 
Kitani Water (27.02 σ
t
) have failed. 
 
We propose a new approach to the problem 
supporting the idea of diapycnal entrainment of 
shelf waters across the continental slope to 
ventilate deep layers with more high density.  
 
Data  
The CTD data have been obtained in five cruises 
during 1998-2000 within the framework of the 
joint German–Russian KOMEX project and the 
subproject “Methane monitoring in the Sea of 
Okhotsk”.  The observations were carried out in 
the same sections for all seasons, even in 
wintertime from drifting ice. 
Results 
The maximum density of water was found on the 
bottom layer on the NE shelf off Sakhalin in 
winter and spring does not exceed 26.84 σ
t
.  The 
most characteristic feature of the seasonal 
variability of oceanographic conditions along the 
continental slope is the seasonal manifestation of 
cold intrusions with negative temperatures.  They 
appear in winter and spring directly on the bottom 
of the shelf and slope and on intermediate depths 
as well.  The vertical scale of these intrusions is up 
to 400 m. 
 
During winter, an extraordinary unstable 
hydrological situation is created in the vicinity of 
shelf break.  It is found that the values of salinity 
and density of the waters on the shelf are higher 
than at corresponding depths offshore.  On the 
other side, at the bottom of the slope the water 
density is lower than at corresponding depths 
offshore.  These features of density and salinity 
distribution have thoroughly been tested and are 
neither artifacts nor defects in calculation (Fig. 1). 
 
The situation on the shelf break becomes unstable 
and favorable for producing of gravitation flow on 
the sloping plane.  Such phenomena are well 
known in geophysics and hydraulic (Turner 1973).  
Our data demonstrates that shelf waters with lower 
than Kitani Water density is sufficient to initiate 
the sinking of water down to the slope.  CTD 
observations demonstrate that shelf water can sink 
down to depths where the density of the 
surrounding waters is higher than 27.1 σ
t
.  In other 
words, a diapycnal entrainment of shelf water into 
intermediate depths takes place across the 
continental slope.

We consider the potential energy shelf waters have 
during cold periods is the main energy source for 
this process. 
 
If shelf waters for some reasons (mean flow, tidal 
currents) start to move into the open sea, they 
would cause a static instability and start to 
penetrate the deep sea.  The static stability  of the 
offshore water column (for example, St.17) 
according to shelf water is calculated by the 
equation (Ivanov-Frantskevich 1956):

Results of calculation demonstrate negative values

density of the profile of St.17 at these depths is 
lower than 26.84 σ
t
.  This is the reason why the 
replacement of water parcels from deep layers by 
upper ones leads to a release of energy (Fig. 2).

Without a doubt, the shelf water sinking down to 
330 dB gets kinetic energy and moves further on 
its way, pushing upward the already more dense 
water.  To determine the possible penetration 
depth of shelf waters we calculated the energy 
necessary for replacement of water column of 
St.17 by shelf water.

Results of calculation demonstrate that shelf 
waters can penetrate down to 615 dB depth.  So, 
the water column of earlier undisturbed water is 
filled by shelf water up to these depths.

We calculated the energy, which would be 
necessary if sinking shelf waters mix with 
surrounding waters in proportion 1:1.  Results of 
calculations prove that the penetration of shelf 
waters across the continental slope and mixing 
with surrounding waters is energetically profitable 
for the whole water column.  The cabbeling effect 
is considered to be the main reason for this.  This 
effect is an additional source of energy and plays 
an important role in the diapycnal mixing of shelf 
waters with surrounding waters across the 
continental slope.  
 
Conclusions 
• CTD data demonstrate the seasonal 
manifestation of static instability of water 
column in the vicinity of shelf break.  We 
consider the potential energy of shelf waters 
during cold period is the main source of 
energy for sinking of shelf waters across the 
slope.  The process of ventilation of 
intermediate depths in the Sea of Okhotsk 
starts with the diapycnal entrainment of shelf 
waters and mixing with surrounding ones near 
the continental slope.  Okhotsk shelf waters 
with densities 26.84 σ
t
 have enough potential 
energy for penetration up to 600 m depths.  
Vertical mixing is inevitable process for near 
slope region during cold season. 
• It is supposed that the sinking of shelf waters 
across the continental slope is seasonally 
dependent and takes place most intensively at 
the northern edge of Sakhalin in the vicinity of 
53°N – 55°N.  Further south lateral advection 
and dissipation processes predominate. 
• The penetration depth of shelf waters depends 
on its density during winter, as well as on the 
heating of the offshore waters during spring, 
i.e. on the density contrast between the shelf 
and offshore waters.  
• The shelf–slope conveyor works until the 
summer heating eliminates the energetic 
difference between shelf and offshore waters.

Application of independent gauges of temperature of model “Pirate - 2000” 
for studying temperature conditions in a benthic layer in northern part of Sea 
of Okhotsk in 2002

The results of using temperature recorders on the 
benthic layers of the northern Sea of Okhotsk in 
2002 are considered.  Significant variability of 
water temperature with wrong diurnal and 
semidiurnal rhythms reveals isothermal areas 
(amplitude of fluctuations - 0˚ С) are revealed.  
The most significant amplitudes of temperature 
fluctuations are recorded near hydrological fronts 
and in areas with active dynamics of water masses. 
 
The spatial characteristic of variability of 
temperature conditions at the bottom can be 
observed in Figure 1.  Analysis of the complex 
data on the spatial distribution of maximal 
amplitude of temperature fluctuations (the shaded 
areas in Fig. 1) and depth contours essential 
distinction of temperature conditions the given 
area is evidently traced.  In the easternmost part 
within the coordinates (57º28’ - 57º35’N and 
153º00’ - 153º10’E), at depths from 460–490 m, 
was a dynamical area in which the maximal 
amplitudes of fluctuations ranged from 0.4-0.5ºC.  
To the east were gradual reductions of daily 
pulsations of temperature and near 57º33’N - 
152º00’E, an isothermal area (amplitude of 
fluctuations 0º С) which is more close to a deep-
water trench was discovered. 
 
During a research cruise of the vessel Nagorsk in 
June – July, two areas with maximal amplitudes of 
temperature fluctuations (Fig. 2) were recorded.  
The first area occurs in the northeastern part of 
range (the intra-daily changes of temperature were 
0.31º С).  The second area is in the southwestern 
part (maximal amplitude - 0.66º С).  In the second 
area, it is possible to explain the maximum daily 
pulsations of temperature as the influence of a 
hydrological front which usually starts to form at 
this time year.  Therefore, in a zone where Iamskoi 
mixed water masses and CIL (a cold intermediate 
layer) appeared at the bottom, sharp daily changes 
of temperature were observed.

The lowest daily temperature fluctuations at the

coordinates 58º11’ - 58º26’N and 152º12’ - 
152º37’E.  It is interesting to note, that at a local 
site (58º26’N - 151º47’E) at a depth of 129 m, an 
isothermal area  (amplitude of fluctuations 0º С), 
similar to the data of supervision “Pivan” was 
observed.  For the most part of the surveyed area, 
daily temperature fluctuations varied within limits 
of 0.1-0.2º С.

The purposes of this paper are to reveal long-term 
variations of Okhotsk and Bering Seas ice-cover 
during 1960-2000, to determine temporary bounds 
of the periods, and to determine when the ice 
developed in-phase our out of phase in the two 
seas, and to research macrosynoptical processes 
responsible for ice conditions over Far Eastern 
seas. 
 
The present work is based on temporal series of 
monthly ice-cover of the Okhotsk Sea and Bering 
Sea from 1960-2000 and on the state of the 
midtroposphere thermobaric field, which was 
characterized by Girs (1974) to occur in one of 
three forms of atmospheric circulation ( З, М1 or 
M2).  
 
According to climatic atlas based on USSR data, 
the edge of Okhotsk Sea ice practically coincides 
with the orientation and location of the -10ºC 
atmospheric isotherm during December - 
February.  In March and April this edge conforms 
to the –8° and -6ºC isotherms, respectively.  The 
edge of Bering Sea ice coincides with the -8ºC 
isotherm in January, -6ºC during February - 
March, and -2ºC in April.  
 
Vasilevskaya (2001) previously researched the 
nature of Okhotsk Sea ice-cover.  During the 
period 1960 through 1978, a total of about 19 
years, there was a time of abnormally excessive 
ice-cover in the Bering Sea.  During this period, as 
in the Okhotsk Sea, there was a decade of 
metastable ice-cover (1966 through 1975).  Over 
the years 1978 through 1997 (about 20 years) the 
ice-covered areas in the Bering Sea have never 
reached the average yearly figures.  
 
It has been reported previously that the extents of 
ice-formation in the Okhotsk and Bering seas are 
negatively correlated (Yakunin 1966, and others).  
During years of severe ice-cover formation in the 
Okhotsk Sea, conditions in the Bering Sea were 
relatively mild.  Nevertheless, a close examination 
of parallel integral curves of seasonal ice-cover 
anomalies (Fig. 1) shows that for some years of 
the specified period, this pattern is not evident.

The simultaneous link between the ice-covers of 
the two seas, over the entire ice season (excluding 
May), is reciprocal (r < 0.).  There is a significant 
lagged (2 months) negative correlation between 
ice-cover in the Okhotsk Sea in February and in 
the Bering Sea in April.  The milder the ice-cover 
conditions were in Okhotsk Sea in February, the 
more intensive they were in April in Bering Sea. 
 
Lagged correlations between ice-cover formation 
processes in these seas, for the majority of the 
months examined over the entire period, are
 115
generally negative.  Out of 30 correlations, 9 are 
positive. During periods of generally out of phase 
ice-formation processes, the number of positive 
correlations is just 1 or 2.  And during the periods 
of generally coincident patterns, the number of 
direct non-synchronous links increases 
significantly up to 17 in 1970-1975, and up to 21 
in the most recent period of 1986-2000.  The non-
synchronous positive correlations are not 
significant.  The temporal displacement of positive 
links is from 1 to 5 months.  In the main, the ice-
cover formation processes in the Bering Sea are 
determined by previous processes in the Okhotsk 
Sea.  
 
The most widespread pattern of atmospheric 
circulation over the Pacific-American sector 
during the ice-season is meridional M2.  It is the 
nature of anomalous behavior of this meridional 
condition that is responsible for the direction of 
ice-formation over the examined seas.  Thus, when 
the M2 pattern repeats frequently, ice-formation 
processes are out of phase (Fig. 1).  
On the other hand, when the integral curve of 
anomalies of this circulation pattern shows 
decline, the processes are simultaneously directed.  
 
Thus, over the last 15 years there was noticable 
trend in ice-cover formation dynamics over the 
Far-eastern seas areas.  Probably it could be some 
kind of indicator of common climate and 
circulation shifts over the Far-eastern region and 
North Pacific.  The important role in the formation 
of ice-processes belongs to thermodynamic layer 
of the middle troposphere over the Pacific 
American sector.

Introduction 
The northwestern Pacific is characterized by 
extremely complex hydrological conditions.  First 
of all, there are powerful currents such as the 
Aleutian, Kuril-Kamchatka, Oyashio, Kuroshio, 
and North Pacific.  As well, the formation of 
hydrological conditions in the NW Pacific is 
strongly affected by the transformed waters of the 
Bering Sea, Okhotsk Sea, Sea of Japan, and the 
East-China Sea that discharge waters to the Pacific 
Ocean via straits of the Aleutian and Kuril Island 
arcs, and also through Tsugaru Strait and Korean 
Strait.  All these conditions make the region to be 
a powerful zone of the Pacific Ocean, and a unique 
natural base for investigating a complex of 
hydrophysical and meteorological processes, the 
understanding of which is necessary for the 
solution of many fundamental and applied 
problems in oceanography. 
 
Initial data 
In the present work, and on the basis of a 
hydrodynamic model (Polyakova and Vlasova 
2002), it is possible to estimate the water 
circulation as integral functions of the flow from 
the surface to the bottom for the NW Pacific, 
taking into account the influence of various types 
of the atmospheric circulation: “North-western”, 
“Okhotsk-Aleutian” and “Cyclones over the 
Ocean” (Polyakova 1999).  The study area is 
confined to 20° – 50°N, 146°E– 180°.  The given 
model allows us to consider the atmosphere 
influence, spatial distribution of water density, 
variable coefficients of the vertical and horizontal 
turbulent exchange, β-effect, bottom topography 
and the coastal outline. 
 
The input information for the calculation of the 
waters circulation are: 
• average monthly fields of the atmospheric 
pressure for the period of 1949-2000, 
corresponding to the earlier distinguished 
types of the atmospheric processes (Polyakova 
1999); 
• the GDEM archive (Generalized Digital 
Environmental Model) – global monthly 
averaged climatic data on temperature and 
salinity on a regular grid 10 x 10;  
• the vertical spatial distribution of the water 
density.  
The depth values were taken from the navigational 
chart (1:5 000 000).  To conduct calculations, a 
regular grid with the space of 10 in latitude and 10 
in longitude was used. 
 
All input information was processed by optimal 
interpolation with the aim of distributing values 
onto the nodes of a regular calculated grid. 
 
Analysis 
The region is characterized by some quasi-
stationary features that are independent of the type 
of atmospheric circulation and season.  It is 
possible to distinguish three areas of strong 
anticyclonic activity and two of cyclonic activity 
(Fig. 1).  For instance, in the areas bounded by 36-
42°N and 145-154°E, 27-33°N and 157-163°E, 
40-42°N and 176°E-180, powerful anticyclonic 
vortices are found.  The first is located near the 
zone of the subarctic front (Bulgakova 1972).  The 
second anticyclonic vortex corresponds to the 
passing subtropical counter-current; one of the 
branches of the Kuroshio.  The presence of the 
third heat source is probably related to the 
influence of the warm North Pacific Current. 
 
In the regions bounded by 33-36°N and 148-
156°E, and also 22-27°N and 158-166°E, cyclonic 
vortices are observed.  The first one coincides with 
the cold Oyashio.  The origin of the second 
cyclonic vortex has not been yet ascertained, by it 
is probably due to the stationary cyclonic eddy 
occurring in this area (Muromtsev 1972).

Fig. 1 Integral function of the stream (Sv) for:  
(a) northwestern type of atmospheric circulation in 
March, (b) Okhotsk-Aleutian type of circulation in 
March, and (c) “Cyclones over the Ocean” type of 
circulation in February. 
 
The inequalities in bottom depth in this area 
should be also taken into account: along the whole 
Kuril Ridge, along the underwater rises and 
troughs where there is a sharp increase in depth.  
In front of any ridge, a sort of backwater is 
formed, which is either turning around the ridge, 
or is concentrated in the general water flow.  For 
instance, the third anticyclonic vortex coincides 
with the location of the Emperor seamounts, and is 
partially copying its configuration, while 
stretching meridionally.  
 
The first and the third anticyclonic vortices are 
located in the area of the subarctic front, and the 
second anticyclonic one and both two cyclonic 
ones are in the subtropical area.  Nelepo et al. 
(1984) show that on the surface of the subarctic 
front, 83 cold anomalies and 72 warm anomalies 
can be found, and on average for the whole year, 
7-8 anomalies of both signs are found.  We should 
note the influence of seasons on these formations: 
in winter and autumn they are distinct, while in 
spring and summer they are somewhat diminished.  
The region is characterized by specific features 
with regard to the type of baric formations 
(Polyakova 2002). 
 
For the “Northwestern” type of atmospheric 
circulation, the integral function of the flow from 
the surface to the bottom for all 12 months was 
calculated.  As a whole, for the given type, the 
predominance of warm waters of anticyclonic 
origin is typical. 
 
In winter, all hydrodynamic structures are 
distinctly.  In spring, the current pattern starts to 
diminish: the subtropical counter-current starts to 
merge with the main branch of the Kuroshio, and 
an area of demonstrated anticyclonic activity in 
the area of the North Pacific Current stretches 
latitudinally, to 160°E, where the Kuroshio 
Current is passing into the North Pacific Current, 
and warmer waters start to prevail (Fig. 1a).  This 
is most distinctly exhibited in summer.  During 
this season, only individual cyclonic vortices are 
exhibited.  In autumn, cold cyclonic eddies start to 
become more active and turn into vortices.  As a 
whole, the autumn pattern of currents is identical 
to the winter pattern. 
 
For the “Okhotsk-Aleutian” type of atmospheric 
circulation the function of the flow from the 
surface to the bottom for 8 months, excluding the 
winter period was calculated.  As a whole, in 
comparison to the “Northwestern” type, the 
pattern of currents is retained, but with the 
predominance of a number of warm anticyclonic 
vortices (Fig. 1b), which stretch meridionally 
while corresponding to the geomorphology of the 
bottom.  Probably, just at the given type of the 
 118
atmospheric circulation, the effect of bottom 
topography prevails.  In spring, the first 
anticyclonic vortex is completely retained, owing 
to the stability of the heat source in this region.  
The second big anticyclonic eddy breaks up into 
individual small anticyclonic vortices, while 
preserving the positive sign of the water area, as a 
whole.  The third one is the most poorly exhibited.  
Areas with the cyclonic vortices are retained. In 
summer, the cyclonic vortices are breaking up into 
individual small vortices, giving the place to the 
warm waters.  And just in autumn, the current 
pattern is again restored over to the spring one.  
 
For the “Cyclones over the Ocean” type, the 
function of flow from the surface to the bottom for 
the winter-autumn months was calculated.  As a 
whole, preserving the general specifics of the 
current pattern, a dominant cyclonic vortex in the 
area of 46-50°N and 158-165°E is observed (Fig. 
1c).  Probably, this is related to the fact that in the 
area of the Kuril-Kamchatka Current, this type of 
atmospheric circulation activates the western 
subarctic gyre. 
 
Conclusions 
The influence of atmospheric processes on the 
hydrodynamic regime in the NW Pacific is shown.  
Quasi-stationary characteristics of the NW Pacific, 
regardless of the type of the atmospheric 
circulation and season, include three anticyclonic 
and two cyclonic vortices.  
 
Specific features of the region are shown, with 
regard to the type of baric formations and their 
spatial-temporal variability:  For the “North-
western” type, the predominance of warm waters 
of anticyclonic origin are evident; for the 
“Okhotsk-Aleutian” type, the largest number of 
anticyclonic eddies of different scales, and also the 
apparent influence of the bottom topography are 
evident.  For the “Cyclones over the Ocean”, a 
cold cyclonic eddy in the area of the Kuril-
Kamchatka Current appears.

The location of regions of strong tidal mixing and 
tidal fronts, which separated stratified waters and 
vertically well-mixed waters on the Okhotsk Sea 
continental shelf during the summer period are 
investigated on the basis of satellite infrared 
images, historical bottle and modern CTD 
measurements.  The tidal fronts are located near 
Shantarskiy Island and Shelikov Bay.  The 
oceanographic conditions over the Kashevarov 
Bank, Iona Bank and around Saint Iona Island are 
also determined by tidal mixing.  Tidal fronts 
appear in June-July when the thermocline is 
formed, and disappear in the fall (September-
October) when the stratification is destroyed.  The 
positions of tidal fronts and intensity of the mixing 
are subjected to changes due to a variety of 
factors:  strength of the tidal currents on the 
shallow shelves, water depth and river runoff.  The 
regions of of intensive tidal mixing are areas of 
high biological productivity.

In the Okhotsk Sea, there are four species of true, 
or else ice-form seals (Phocidae): ringed seal 
(Pusa hispida), ribbon seal (Histriophoca 
fasciata), bearded seal (Erignatus barbatus), larga 
(Phoca largha).  In addition, there are two species 
of eared seals:  northern fur seal (Callorhinus 
ursinus) and Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus).  
The Kuril Islands are inhabited by the isle form of 
the common seal, also called antour (Phoca 
vitulina stejnegeri). 
 
According to their spatial distributions during the 
main periods in their life cycle (reproduction, 
rearing pups, molting), and taking into 
consideration their gatherings during other life 
periods in the Okhotsk Sea, Fedoseyev (2000) 
distinguished three populations of ringed seals:  
• East-Sakhalin, numbering up to 130,000 
animals;  
• Tatarsko-Shantarskaya, or Northeastern 
(485,000);  
• Shelikhovskaya (110,000). 
 
The ribbon seal has two populations in the 
Okhotsk Sea:  
• East-Sakhalin (160,000); 
• Northwestern (210,000).  
 
The larga seal has three populations in this region: 
• Terpeniya Gulf (55,000);  
• Northern (215,000);  
• Kuril (3,500).  
 
Bearded seal forms two populations:  
• East-Sakhalin (60,000); 
• Northern (from Okhotsk to Shelikhov Bay) 
with 140,000 animals. 
The Kuril population of isle seal makes up 2,000-
2,500 individuals (Kuzin et al. 1974), but 
according to census data in 2000, it holds 3,000-
3,500 animals (Kornev et al. 2001).  
 
Of the two species of eared seals living in the 
Okhotsk Sea, the northern fur seal is the most 
numerous.  Its breeding grounds, occupied during 
summer and autumn, are located at Tyuleniy 
(Robben) Island and in the middle Kurils.  At 
present, there are more than 80,000 fur seals at the 
former and about 24,000-26,000 are born every 
year.  The annual take amounts to 1,600-1,800 
animals.  In the Kuril Islands, the rookeries of this 
species are known to be at both Srednego Island, 
where, according to the data of total count in 1988, 
7,100 adult fur seals lay and 8,100 were born, and 
in the Kamenniye Lovushki Islands, where about 
9,100 adults and 5,700 pups live (Kuzin et al. 
1988).  In 2000 (a count was carried out before the 
reproductive cycle was over although there was no 
landing at the rookeries at Vysokaya and 
Chyornaya) 6,508 adults and 4,206 pups were 
counted on the Srednego Islands, and 6,742 adults 
and 2,755 pups on the Kamenniye Lovushki.  
 
Steller sea lions in the Okhotsk Sea form several 
rookeries.  There are bachelor haul-out sites and 
juvenile ones.  The most numerous group of 
Steller sea lions inhabits the Kuril Islands.  Here 
the animals form numerous harem rookeries 
(islands:  Brat Chirpoyev, Srednego, Kamenniye 
Lovushki, Raykoke, Antsiferova), and juvenile 
and bachelor haul-out sites (Perlov 1970).  The 
total count of sea lions inhabiting the Kurils made 
up a little more than 5,000, among them 1,900 
pups (Burkanov et al. 2002).  A rather numerous 
 122
reproductive group of Steller sea lions is situated 
on the Iony Islands, where 952 pups were born in 
2001, and the number of adult individuals 
exceeded 1,500 (Zadalskiy 2002).  At Tyuleniy 
(Robben) Isl. in 2002, according to our counting 
data, the number of adult Steller sea lions was 
close to 1,500, with more than 400 pups.  In the 
Iamskiy Islands in 2001, the number of newborn 
totaled 360, and the number of adults counted 
exceeded 900 animals.  On the Lisyanskiy 
Peninsula there lay a little more than 200 adults 
and two dozens of newborn in 2000.  There is one 
not large bachelor haul-out here too.  On 
Zavyalova Island, there was a juvenile haul-out 
site with a total of about 100-130 individuals 
(Zadalskiy 2002).  One bachelor haul-out with 
unsteady numbers (200-500 animals) is located at 
Opasnostiy Rock (LaPerouse Strait) and another is 
at Sivuchiy Cape (Western Kamchatka), where the 
number of animals ranges from a few dozen to 
2,500 in winter and in March depending on the 
season (Burkanov 1988). 
 
On the whole, the numbers of fin-footed seals in 
the Okhotsk Sea, together with those from the 
Kurils, make up 1.8 million animals;  90% are true 
seals (ringed seal, ribbon seal, bearded seal, larga, 
isle seal/antour) and the rest (10%) are eared seals 
(northern fur seal and Steller sea lion).  Among the 
former, ringed seal and ribbon seal are the most 
numerous, amounting to 40% and 20%, 
respectively, of all seal bioresources in the region. 
Bearded seals and larga have equal indexes (each 
12%). 
 
All the true seals were commercially harvested 
species in the past. Before 1968, sealing was not 
regulated (annual catch of 66,000-102,000 
animals), that naturally resulted in harsh 
population decline.  Later on, due to some 
reduction in total sealing (down to 38,000-47,500) 
and strict limiting of its rates, the stocks were 
restored.  In the following years, sealing was 
carried on in keeping with scientifically-based 
recommendations.  Since the middle 1980s, the 
quota has been raised to 72,000-89,000 animals 
per year, and catches reached 95% of this in the 
Okhotsk Sea and 70-80% in the Bering Sea 
(Perlov 2000).  However, sealing from ships in Far 
Eastern seas has been discontinued completely 
since 1995 as the specialized ships became out of 
date and too depreciated, and because of well-
known changes caused by the politics of the 
country.  
 
Along with ship sealing, there was land sealing in 
which coastal kolkhozes and sovkhozes 
participated.  Their share of the sealing quotas was 
up to 20%, but the realized catch was not more 
than 60% of this.   
 
Today, ship sealing in Far Eastern seas is not 
being carried on, though the annually approved 
sealing forecast for Okhotsk Sea of makes up 
nearly 60,000 animals.  Coast brigades take not 
more than 30% of 24,800 seals yearly apportioned 
for hunting. 
 
Taking into consideration the stability of seal 
abundance in the Okhotsk Sea during the 1990s, 
and a prolonged absence of sealing, and a positive 
response to the reduction of hunting, with 
subsequent numbers increasing, we may suggest 
the seal stock in the Okhotsk Sea is in a safe state 
at present.  However, when considering sealing for 
true seals in the future, we should keep in mind 
that it must not be as large-scale as in the past. 
 
The number of fur seals at Tyuleniy (Robben) 
Island has been increasing steadily since 1993, and 
on the Kurils it has apparently remained at the 
reached level since 1988.  The number of Steller 
sea lions on the Kuril Islands has been in steady 
state after the depression of 1970-90s, but on the 
rookeries of other parts of the Sea of Okhotsk, it is 
increasing each year.  The number of true seals in 
the Kurils has increased a little for late years.

Seasonal and annual dynamics of nektonic community in the western 
Kamchatka region

Western Kamchatka and Shelikhov Bay are among 
the most highly productive areas within the 
Okhotsk Sea where high biomasses of bottom and 
pelagic fish species are found.  For a long period 
of time, the fish communities of these regions 
experienced permanent pressure from the fishery, 
which had a considerable impact on the dynamics 
of species abundance. 
 
TINRO-Centre has conducted annual expeditions 
to the Okhotsk Sea during spring and 
autumn/winter for several years.  The basic 
objective of these expeditions was to collect 
diversified information on the condition of 
biological resources in the pelagic zone. 
Collection of baseline data was made under a 
unified approach, accepted in TINRO-Centre.  
Research and survey schemes occurred at the same 
time every year.  Baseline data, collected in 1998-
2002, provided information on yearly and seasonal 
dynamics in nektonic abundance. 
 
During the period of research, considerable 
quantitative changes were observed in the nektonic 
communities in the western Kamchatka region.  A 
sharp drop in total biomass from 5.1 down to 2.5 
million metric tonnes (mmt) in spring, and from 
3.5 to 1.8 mmt in autumn was observed in 1999 
compared to 1998.  In the following year, total 
biomass increased to 3.6 mmt in spring and 
continued to grow to 4.35 mmt in 2001, with a 
subsequent decline to 3.99 mmt in 2002.  Biomass 
dynamics were slightly different in the autumn-
winter period.  After a sharp drop in 1999, the 
biomass continued to decline, though with less 
intensity down to 1.66 mmt in 2000.  In the 
ensuing two years, there was a smooth, continuous 
growth of biomass, up to 2.2 mmt in 2002.

The total assessed biomass of the nektonic 
community fluctuated both annually and 
seasonally.  Spring estimates during 1998-1999 
were 1.4 times higher than autumn estimates.  In 
the succeeding two years, this ratio increased up to 
2.2, and was 1.8 in 2002.  The reasons for such 
drastic changes in biomass are associated with the 
structural features of high latitude nektonic 
communities in general, and of the northern 
Okhotsk Sea in particular.  Only two to three 
species provide the basis for the observed biomass 
estimates in the area. 
 
The most abundant species were: walleye pollock 
(Theragra chalcogramma), capelin (Mallotus 
villosus), Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi), and 
northern smoothtongue (Leuroglossus schmidti).  
Along with these species, considerable amounts of 
Sakhalin flounder (Limanda sakhalinensis) have 
been also found in the region.  The share of these 
five species exceeded 89.9% in the total assessed 
biomass of nekton during the whole period of 
research.  At the same time, the share of each of 
these species in the total community biomass 
varied from year to year. 
 
Walleye pollock biomass varied considerably 
during the time of research (Fig. 1).  Nevertheless, 
almost without exception, it was the key species 
within the nektonic community.  Pollock was 
much more abundant in spring, comprising 84.3-
92.5% of the total biomass, than in autumn when 
its share ranged from 12.4-86.5%.  During the last 
two years, the extent of pollock dominance in 
nektonic community has noticeably increased.  
The observed seasonal variability in pollock 
biomass fits within the known scheme of the 
functional structure of the species range in the 
eastern Okhotsk Sea.  During the period of 
spawning from March to May, almost all mature 
pollock are concentrated in the area of the outer 
shelf and slope.  After spawning, most large 
individuals, that make up the bulk of the species 
biomass, scatter over vast areas in the epi- and 
mesopelagic layers.  The growth of the pollock 
share in autumn during recent was evidently due to 
the fact that individuals larger than 40 cm stayed 
in the shelf-slope region all year round.  That is 
why, taking into consideration seasonal 
distribution patterns, spring surveys provide the 
most reliable estimates of the species biomass.

 126
As for the annual dynamics of pollock biomass, it 
ded sharply in 1999 and began to recover in 2000.  
Pollock removals by the fishery could have caused 
the decline in the species abundance.  From 1997, 
when fishing pressure on the depressed pollock 
stock increased, until 1999, the exploitation rate 
was the highest in the last 20 years;  much higher 
than the maximum allowable catch, with as much 
as 68% withdrawal from the stock in 1998.  The 
increase of stock biomass in 2000 and its further 
stability were partly due to the average weight 
gain of fish, and to the immigration of individuals 
from adjacent areas. 
 
As for the other components of the nektonic 
community, their seasonal pattern of total biomass 
variability was opposite to that observed in 
pollock (Fig. 2).  Biomass estimates for those 
species were higher in autumn than in spring, 
except for the last two years.  Changing 
distribution might have accounted for such 
variability in the biomass assessments.  In spring, 
most capelin and herring migrate to coastal 
spawning areas that are not covered by the 
surveys.  These two species had high biomass 
(1.5-1.6 mmt) in 1998 and 1999.  Sakhalin founder 
added considerably to the non-pollock nektonic 
biomass in 1998, as did northern smoothtongue in 
1999. Stock abundance of most of these species 
ded significantly during the next three years, 
except for northern smoothtongue that had its 
highest biomass in the autumn of 2000.  Dynamics 
of abundance as well as migration and distribution 
patterns served as basic reasons for the observed 
biomass decline.  The former cause is 
characteristic for short-lived species such as 
capelin, whose distributional range is restricted to 
the shelf zone.  The decline in herring abundance 
is related to its distribution pattern.  Both factors 
could have influenced observed biomass changes 
of northern smoothtongue and Sakhalin flounder.  
Other taxa within the nektonic community are 
cephalopods, for which the total assessed biomass 
increased from 73.3 up to 131.2 thousand t by 
2001, judging from autumn surveys.  In 2002 
however, cephalopods abundance ded down to its 
minimum estimate of 32.4 thousand t.

Two large populations of Pacific herring are 
known to exist in the northern Okhotsk Sea: 
Okhotsk and Gizhiginsk-Kamchatsk (Naumenko 
2000).  Lately, considerable fluctuations in 
abundance were observed in these populations, 
which led to changes in migration timing and 
routes, as well as in location of feeding and 
wintering areas (Melnikov and Vorobyov 2001; 
Melnikov 2002; Radchenko and Melnikov 2001).  
This seriously affects the fishery for herring 
during the autumn period.  In order to analyze the 
distribution, migration and stock abundance of 
herring, we used data from large-scale trawl 
surveys, conducted by TINRO-Centre in 
September-October 2001 and November-
December 2002.  All data on herring were 
analyzed using standard techniques accepted in 
TINRO-Centre and published in a number of 
papers (Radchenko and Melnikov 2001; Melnikov 
2002). 
 
In 2001 and 2002 only 68-71% of the 
recommended quotas for the Okhotsk herring were 
taken in the fishery.  In our opinion, this was 
largely due to the influence of the cold winter of 
2000-2001, and to the existence of intra-
population groupings (two in Okhotsk herring and 
two in Gizhiginsk-Kamchatsk herring), that are 
thought to have different patterns of dynamics in 
their abundance. 
 
In September-October 2001, the distribution of 
herring was very similar to that in July - August 
1997, when the main aggregations of herring were 
observed in the northwestern Okhotsk Sea with 
features characteristic of feeding aggregations.  
The shift in time of pre-wintering aggregations by 
almost a month in autumn 2001 was related to the 
late approach of herring to most spawning sites in 
the spring of 2001 due to the cold winter 2000-
2001.  As a result, the shorter feeding period did 
not allow mature fish to accumulate enough fat for 
overwintering by September 2001, and they 
continued to feed until October-November (this 
was not observed in immature fish).  Slow 
maturation rates in the 1996 and 1997 cohorts, 
together with increased natural mortality of older 
fishes were also observed.

The analysis of data on Pacific herring collected 
during wide scale trawl surveys in recent years has 
allowed us to make some suggestions about the 
herring stock structure.  Four relatively isolated 
groups were observed (two in the Okhotsk and two 
in Gizhiginsk-Kamchatka herring), that differ in 
locality during feeding and wintering (Fig. 1), in 
periods and directions of migrations, growth rates 
and other features.  In the Okhotsk population, the 
large extent of the spawning area might account 
for its subdivision into groups, while in 
Gizhiginsk-Kamchatka herring, it may be due to 
differences in oceanographic conditions between 
the Gizhiginsk Bay and northwestern Kamchatka.  
We shall briefly consider these groupings.  First of 
all, it is necessary to notice that they are 
apparently not independent populations, for their 
appearance and numbers depends on a pattern of 
filling of spawning grounds in various parts of the 
spawning area.  As for the Okhotsk herring, the 
western group is highly abundant when ice 
conditions in spring allows spawning fish to get to 
the central and western parts of the spawning 
grounds.  Later on, this group acquires certain 
independence and becomes relatively stable.  It 
means that during their lifetime, most fish feed 
and overwinter separately from individuals of the 
eastern group, mixing with them only during 
spawning period. 
 
Western group of the Okhotsk herring  
Its spawning grounds are located in the western 
part of the spawning region (southwest of 58°N).  
After spawning, yearlings and mature herring 
migrate in a southeast direction, and actively feed 
on the shelf in 4, 5 and 10 areas.  Fish of age 3 and 
older start to form pre-wintering aggregations in 
August above northwestern Deryugin Trench.  At 
low abundance, all of them overwinter in this area, 
moving to depths over 200 m.  At high numbers, 
some schools migrate into the Taui area (2) at the 
end of August, while some migrate in October - 
November right to the wintering area south of the 
Kashevarov Bank. Mostly old (8 years and older) 
and immature fish remain in the pre-wintering 
area.  The share of fish migrating to the other areas 
is smaller during periods of low abundance.  
Mature herring of this group, especially at high 
abundance, can spawn beyond its usual spawning 
sites in case they are closed by ice fields.  Under 
favorable conditions, they occupy the natal 
spawning regions.  Individuals of the western 
group differ by having a lower growth rate, later 
maturation and later spawning migrations.  At low 
abundance, this group is not harvested by the 
fishery its aggregations are located under the ice 
during winter and therefore, can be taken only 
occasionally during fishery for pollock at the 
Kashevarov Bank.  At high abundance, this group 
partly migrates to the Taui area in autumn, where 
it is taken commercially together with fish from 
the eastern group. 
 
Eastern group of the Okhotsk herring   
The eastern group has been studied best of all.  Its 
spawning grounds are located in the central and 
eastern parts of the range (from the Okhotsk area 
up to Taui Bay).  Post-spawning fish and yearlings 
feed on the shelf in areas 2 and 3, and in the 
northern part of area 4.  Pre-wintering 
aggregations of this herring are found in the Taui 
area (2), the traditional area of the fishery.  It 
moves southward and descends to 200 m and 
deeper to over-winter.  The spawning migration is 
usually observed on the shelf off Okhotsk as the 
fish move to their spawning grounds, as they 
become ice-free.  It is this group of herring that 
suffers most from the fishery both in spring and in 
autumn-winter periods. 
 
Gizhiginsk group of the Gizhiginsk-Kamchatka 
herring 
The spawning grounds are located in Gizhiginsk 
Bay along the northern coast of Shelikhov Gulf.  
Post-spawning fish and juveniles over 2 years old 
move away from the gulf area to feed in the 
central and eastern Taui area.  Pre-wintering and 
overwintering aggregations are distributed 
together with the Okhotsk herring of the eastern 
group above the northern continental slope of the 
TINRO Trench.  It is taken in the Taui area 
together with the Okhotsk herring. 
 
Kamchatka group of the Gizhiginsk-
Kamchatka herring   
This group is almost uninvestigated.  It spawns 
from Penzhin Bay up to Ust-Chairusovo (possibly 
further south) in weakly populated areas.  Young 
fish feed in southeastern Shelikhov Gulf and off 
the western Kamchatka coast.  Fish aged 3 and 
older occur on the shelf of western Kamchatka 
down to the southernmost part of this area, and are 
 129
frequently distributed to near the bottom.  Pre-
wintering and overwintering aggregations are 
formed offshore bounded latitudinally by the 
Southern Cape in north, and Chairusov Cape in the 
south (57°10’-57°50’N).  It spends autumn at 
depths of 120-170 m, and overwinters at 220-270 
m.  It is less abundant than the Gizhiginsk group 
and is practically not harvested by commercial 
fishery in recent years. 
 
It is easy to notice that all three areas of feeding 
and overwintering of herring in the northern 
Okhotsk Sea are highly productive areas 
connected with periphery of strong upwelling. 
 
The trawl survey carried out in autumn 2001 
(September - October) completely confirmed 
earlier results.  The main aggregations of herring 
were observed in the northwestern part of the sea 
in September - October.  The biomass of the 
herring stock was estimated at approximately 1.8 
mmt.  The pre-wintering aggregation in the Taui 
area was almost totally absent (approximately 50 
thousand t of fish were counted here, with only 10 
thousand t within the aggregation) and schools 
migrating into this area were observed very 
seldom.  There was also no pre-wintering 
aggregation of the Gizhiginsk-Kamchatka herring 
that usually forms from the end of September till 
the beginning of October along the northwestern 
Kamchatka coast.  On the whole, patterns of 
herring distribution and behavior had a marked 
“feeding” character, and were approximately the 
same as in the middle of July/August 1997.  
However, the analysis of distribution by age 
groups showed that the location of “summer” type 
aggregations was characteristic only for the mature 
fish.  Immature individuals had already moved 
away from the coastal zone and were widely 
distributed on the shelf, as is usual in autumn. 
 
In October, the autumn cooling apparently 
prevented usual migrations of fish from 
Kashevarov Bank to the Taui area along the shelf.  
That is why a number of herring schools migrated 
into the wintering area via a non-conventional way 
– to the east south of the Kashevarov Bank, 
passing by the area where pre-wintering 
aggregations are usually formed.  This led to 
certain complications for the commercial fishery 
and as a result, only 78% of the Okhotsk herring 
quotas were taken. 
 
Interesting results were obtained in November - 
December 2002.  Herring distribution and 
behavior had characteristic pre-wintering and 
over-wintering features (Fig. 2).  Both mature 
herring and some immature individuals aggregated 
near Iona Island and on the central northern 
Okhotsk Sea shelf.  Its biomass was estimated at 
424 thousand t for the Iona aggregations alone, 
while in the main fishing area it was estimated at 
563 thousand t. South of Taui Bay migrating 
schools, mainly immature fish, were rare.  There 
was no pre-wintering aggregation of the 
Gizhiginsk-Kamchatka herring, which usually 
forms from the end of September to the beginning 
of October off the northwestern Kamchatka coast.  
In the western part of the sea, local aggregations of 
large herring, identified by a number of features as 
the Gizhiginsk-Kamchatka population, was 
registered.  As a result of research conducted in 
2002, it was shown that herring from the two 
populations overlaps in their distributions, both 
during feeding and over-wintering.  The existence 
of pre-wintering and over-wintering aggregations

of the Okhotsk herring in the Iona-Kashevarov 
area confirms that there is a relatively independent 
intrapopulation group of the Okhotsk herring in 
the northwestern Okhotsk Sea (Melnikov and 
Vorobyov 2001; Melnikov 2002). 
 
The abundance of herring in the autumn - winter 
of 2002 was much higher than in 2001, due to a 
high abundance of yearlings, estimated at 44.5 
billion individuals, while total biomass decreased 
by over 1 million t and was estimated at 1.65 
million t (Table 1).  Fish from the high-yielding 
1996 and 1997 generations dominated among 
recruits, and the very low abundance of the 1999 
cohort was confirmed.  In 1998 and 2000, cohort 
strength was average. 
 
The considerable drop in biomass of herring in 
2002 was primarily connected with natural and 
fishery removals of older fishes (age 10+ and 
higher).  The biomass (Table 1) in the autumn of 
2001 exceeded 500 thousand t, and in 2002 
decreased to 134.4 thousand t.  Severe 
oceanographic conditions during the 2000-2001 
winter, and a reduction of the feeding period in the 
summer - autumn of 2001, apparently resulted in 
increased natural mortality of all age groups 
forming commercial stock.  Preliminary data show 
that there was a decrease in growth rate, individual 
fecundity, life span, and an increase in age at mass 
maturity in age groups of recruits.  The 
commercial fishery for pre-spawning fish that was 
permitted beginning from 2001 (formerly, harvest 
operations on these fish were conducted as a 
scientific monitoring), also might have played a 
negative role.  By our assessments, along with 
official catch of 73 thousand t of pre-spawning 
herring in spring 2001, the real number of 
harvested fish amounted over 120-150 thousand t.  
Most males, and female caracasses (after roe is 
removed) were discarded.  To make uncontrollable 
catch lower, it is necessary to forbid a fishery for 
pre-spawning fish, and to stop supplying local and 
foreign markets with herring roe.

It is known that the viability of some Pacific 
salmon bred at fishery hatcheries is considerably 
lower than that of natural populations.  This is 
illustrated by decreasing returns of the hatchery-
reared fish.  Methods of dry fertilization used at 
the hatcheries results in low activity sperm 
participating in fertilization along with vigorous 
sperm.  This is probably one of the causes of the 
decrease in quality of salmon offspring at the 
hatcheries.  The paper presents studies of 
specimens of natural and hatchery populations of 
chum and pink salmon.  The material for study 
was obtained from the Barabashevskiy Fish 
Hatchery (Primorskiy Region) and the Sokolovsky 
Fish Hatchery (Sakhalin Island), as well as from 
the Rivers Melkaya, Tym’ and Belaya (Sakhalin 
Island) in 1988-1994. 
 
At the hatcheries, eggs were fertilized with the 
help of trivial dry method of fertilization (control). 
Besides, we received the posterity using the 
technique of spermal selection (SS) - selection of 
the most active fraction of sperm.  In this case, 
before fertilizing the sperms were activated in the 
absence of eggs in definite conditions, and after 
that they were mixed with the eggs.  Then the less 
active sperms were loosing their activity and 
didn’t participate in fertilization. 
 
The level of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) was 
selected as a criterion of stable ontogenesis and 
significance of heredity during the formation of 
some characteristic features in the study 
populations.  The features measured included: 
number of pores of seismosensory channels, gill 
rakers, rays in pectoral fins and ventral fins, spots 
along the side line.  The indices of viability and 
sex ratio were studied too.  The chum studied in 
the presented work are characterized by high 
occurrence of fluctuating asymmetry (FA).  
Disorder in fry symmetry reflects the state of the 
population and the level of individual viability. 
Generally, the FA level was highest in chum fry 
from the hatchery populations of Sakhalin Island 
(Sokolovskiy hatchery) and Primorskiy Region 
(Barabashevskiy hatchery) when dry method of 
fertilization was applied (Table 1).  The fry of 
natural populations (in the rivers Melkaya and 
Tym’, Sakhalin Island) and those bred using the 
SS method had reduced levels of FA.  
 
The study populations were distinguished from 
each other by several features, such as number of 
spots along side line, number of rays in pectoral 
fins, number of gill rakers, and number of pores.  
 
We note that the use of the SS method increases 
the sizes and weights of fry.  The power of this 
method is that the level of individual viability is 
higher in SS fry (Table 2). 
 
The summarized results indicate that FA level is 
lower in chum salmon that reproduced in natural 
conditions than those populations which bred in 
hatchery.  It is possible because those wild 
specimens that are fittest for survival after natural 
selection that took place.  But better FA indicators 
were noticed in the experiments with SS that were 
conducted at Sokolovskiy hatchery.  The lowest 
FA values were observed in number of spots, gill 
rakers, rays of pectoral fins and pores.  Their 
values were nearer to the FA values of wild fishes 
from the rivers Melkaya and Tym’ (Table 1).  FA 
indicators of fishes from Barabashevskiy hatchery 
are 1.5–2.0 times greater than fishes from other 
study regions, according to features such as pores 
of seismosensoric channels on the preoperculum, 
rays of pectoral fins, and number of gill rakers.  
This may be linked with an unfavorable water 
regimen at the Barabashevskiy hatchery during the 
period of study.  Also, conditions of dry 
fertilization are an additional unfavorable factor.

It should be noted when considering various 
features that the coincidence of number of spots is 
not a vital feature and it is unlikely to be evidence 
for symmetry of body sides.  This is perhaps the 
reason why the greatest variations of values (from 
6 to 19 spots) were observed in this feature (Fig. 
1).  The greatest feature variability was observed 
at the Sokolovskiy hatchery.  In experiments using 
the SS method, the variability of features was 
reduced.  The same picture was observed in 
pectoral fins and gill rakers (Figs. 2 and 3).  
Apparently, sperm selection decreased fish feature 
diversity.  
 
Considering FA magnitudes among all studied 
populations, these were certainly distinctive from 
each other (Table 1).  The lowest level of spot FA 
was characteristic of the experimental (SS) fry of 
Sokolovskiy hatchery.  
 
The pore feature is conservative.  The number of 
pores is the lowest among other features (Fig. 4).  
Numbers of pores are rather similar among fishes 
from different areas.  Fishes from the rivers 
Melkaya and Tym’ were distinguished slightly 
(Table 1).  The lowest level of FA in pore numbers

was for fry from the rivers Melkaya and Tym’, and 
also for fry bred with the SS method at 
Sokolovskiy hatchery (0.16, 0.16, and 0.17 
respectively, Table 1). 
 
Deviations in numbers of gill rakers indicate 
asymmetry of gills.  Observed values ranged from 
9-13 (Fig. 3).  Individuals from Barabashevskiy 
hatchery were distinguished by greater numbers of 
gill rakers.  The Barabashevskiy hatchery 
population was essentially distinctive from the rest 
(0.34) in regard of FA magnitude of gill rakers 
number.  We have already pointed to unfavorable 
water regimen at this hatchery as a possible source 
of this developmental asymmetry.  It should also 
be pointed out that defective spade-shaped 
pectoral fins (>70%) occurred in fry from this 
hatchery.  They looked like stumps, half the length 
compared with usual ones.  They were like nibbled 
round edges that made it difficult to count the 
number of rays.  This phenomenon could be linked 
with unfavorable water regimen and an aggressive 
bacterial medium at the hatchery. 
 
FA differences in pectoral fins rays of fishes from 
hatchery and natural populations proved to be 
significant (Table 1).  Wild fry were frequently 
similar to the experimental (SS) fry.  On the one 
hand, the similarity resulted from fertilization by 
dry method at Barabashevskiy and Sokolovskiy 
hatchery (0.69 and 0.63), and on the other hand 
they occurred in wild populations from the rivers 
Melkaya, Tym’ and the experimental ones from 
Sokolovsky hatchery. 
 135
Mean FA indicators of numbers of rays were equal 
to 12-13 (Fig. 2);  the range was 9-16.  The range 
was greatest (9-15) in pectoral fins of fishes from 
Sokolovsky hatchery although the fry was smaller, 
comparing to other locations.  It was considerable 
at Barabashevskiy hatchery (10-14).  Application 
of SS produced fry that differed less.  They were 
similar to fishes from the river Melkaya, because 
under natural conditions, there is natural selection 
of the fittest, including among sperm.  The most 
frequent occurrences of fish with 12-13 rays in 
pectoral fins are displayed clearly.  Fry with 9-11 
rays have smaller body parameters.  
Considering the number of the ventral fins rays, 
we found that this feature is conservative indicator 
of FA.  It is mentioned only to report its non-
significant variability.  Representative distinctions 
between numbers of indicators in left and right 
sides of the fishes were not disclosed, to be precise 
there were not observed the prevailing increase in 
a feature indication for one side. 
 
Variability in the above features of the studied 
populations has been described.  It is evident that 
specimens of each studied population were 
characterized by certain typical indices of these 
features and FA of the paired features. 
 
Pink salmon fry had of lower values of some 
indices of FA (Table 1).  It had reduced level of 
FA of pectoral fin rays and gill rakers and had the 
highest level of FA of for pores in the seismo-
sensory channels.

Summer surveys in the southern Okhotsk Sea from 
1991-2002 have shown that the nekton fish species 
biomass is dominated by three or four taxa (Table 
1).  Up to the mid 1990s, the proportion of walleye 
pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Pacific 
sardine (Sardinops s. melanosticta) in the overall 
fish biomass was notable.  A short period of high 
abundance of Pacific sardine (exceeding 1 million 
t during the 1980s in the southern Okhotsk Sea), 
ended by the early 1990s.  By the late 1990s, no 
Pacific sardines were noted in the southern 
Okhotsk Sea.  A concurrent decrease of walleye 
pollock biomass took place as its foraging 
migrations to the southern deep-water part of the 
Okhotsk Sea ceased.  In particular, the share of 
walleye pollock equaled 90% of the overall fish 
species biomass in the deep-water regions of the 
sea.  By the late 1990s, walleye pollock and 
Pacific sardine ceased to appear in the epipelagic 
layer of the southern Okhotsk Sea. 
During the summer of the late 1990s, the leading 
role in the upper epipelagic fish community was 
taken by representatives of southern-boreal and 
subtropical complexes - Japanese anchovy 
(Engraulis japonica) and arabesque greenling 
(Pleurogrammus azonus).  The scale of these 
species migrations into Okhotsk Sea depends both 
on their abundance and on hydrological conditions 
of a particular year.  Mass northward migrations of 
southern species occur during abnormally high sea 
surface temperatures in the southern part of the 
Okhotsk Sea, resulting from an increase in Soya 
Current flow.  Besides these species, other 
subtropical fishes migrated up to the northern 
continental coast of the Okhotsk Sea in the late 
1990s.  In 1999 and 2000, several specimens of 
striped mullet (Mugil cephalus) were caught in the 
Tauisky region.  There were no previous reports of 
this species migrating so far to the north.

The northern smoothtongue (Leuroglossus 
schmidti), a mesopelagic species, is a constant 
component of both northern boreal and southern 
boreal fish communities of the upper epipelagic 
layer in Okhotsk Sea.  Large interannual changes 
of northern smoothtongue abundance depend 
mostly on the intensity of its vertical migrations 
from the mesopelagic layer into the upper layers.  
In the 1980s, it was considered that total northern 
smoothtongue biomass in the Okhotsk Sea was 
comparable with that of walleye pollock (Ilyinsky 
1998).  Due to the decrease of walleye pollock 
biomass during the 1990s, it is most likely that the 
total northern smoothtongue biomass is highest 
among pelagic fish species in the southern deep-
water part of the Okhotsk Sea. 
 
Pacific salmon species (Oncorhynchus spp.) in the 
southern Okhotsk Sea are represented mostly by 
mature pre-anadromous spawners during the 
summer.  Almost every year during the 1990s, the 
total Russian catch of Pacific salmon was more 
than 200 thousand t.  The major share of catch was 
of the most abundant species – pink salmon (O. 
gorbuscha).  During the last decade its catches 
exceeded 100 thousand t, reaching 216 thousand t 
in 1991.  During June-July of 1991-1995 period 
and July-August of 1996-2000 period, pink 
salmon was the most abundant among salmon 
species in the southern Okhotsk Sea.  In August of 
2001-2002, the biomass of this species in this area 
was lowered significantly.  At the same time, 
growth of chum salmon (O. keta) biomass (mean: 
80.45 thousand t, Table 1) was observed.  These 
changes were due to the autumn chum salmon 
migrations into this region, while the part of pink 
salmon has already departed for the spawning 
grounds. 
 
The cephalopod biomass was highest in the first 
half of the 1990s (46.9 thousand t) and declined 
after the second half of 1990s, as was observed for 
pink salmon. 
 
It seems that the presence of significant amounts 
of forage plankton has a major effect on the 
migrations of the following groups.  The first 
group is subtropical and boreal fishes and squids, 
which migrate into the southern Okhotsk Sea, and 
the second is the plankton-consuming mesopelagic 
fishes and squids, which migrate from the 
mesopelagic layer into upper epipelagic layer.  For 
 138
instance, the relative abundance of 
macrozooplankton in this part of the sea during the 
summer of 1997-2001 period amounted 65-196 
t/km
2
.  The ratio between planktonic and nektonic 
biomass during the summers of 1997-2002 in the 
southern Okhotsk Sea ranged between 29 and 113, 
which is significantly higher than the northern 
Okhotsk Sea (7.5– 20.5 for the same time period).  
 
With the start of autumn, significant changes occur 
in the composition and structure of southern 
Okhotsk Sea nekton communities.  These changes 
are mostly the result of migrations of salmon 
spawners into the rivers, the migrations of juvenile 
salmon to the sea, and partially to the migration of 
subtropical species towards the south due to the 
seasonal cooling of surface waters.  During 1998-
2000 and 2001-2002, the overall biomass of 
Pacific salmon species in the southern Okhotsk 
Sea amounted 296-298 thousand t, on average 
(Table 2).  Pink salmon juveniles comprised 26.1-
42.2% from this biomass, and 0+ chum salmon 
comprised 13.3-19.1% during this time period. 
 
Besides Pacific salmon, Japanese anchovy and 
northern smoothtongue did comprise a substantial 
share in the overall fish species biomass (21.9 and 
31.8%, respectively) in September-October of 
1998-2000 (Table 2).  During the October of 
2001-2002 only northern smoothtongue had a 
significant biomass (108.86 thousand t) in the 
upper epipelagic layer.  Juvenile arabesque 
greenling, which is quite abundant in summer, 
migrates into benthic habitats in shelf zone in the 
autumn and occurs only incidentally in the 
epipelagic layer.  
 
In October-November, after the seasonal 
southward migration of Japanese anchovy, two 
groups dominate in the upper epipelagic layer of 
deep-water part of Okhotsk Sea – juvenile Pacific 
salmon (mostly pink and chum salmon) and 
northern smoothtongue.

Introduction 
The Okhotsk Seawater is a source of cold, fresh, 
and high-oxygen water contributing to the 
formation of Oyashio water and North Pacific 
Intermediate Water (NPIW) characterized by a 
salinity minimum at the density of about 26.8 σ
θ
 
(Talley 1991; Yasuda et al. 2002; Yamamoto et al. 
2002).  The Okhotsk Sea and its water exchange 
with the North Pacific play an important role, not 
only in the local environment, but also in 
determining the water properties of the North 
Pacific (Ohshima et al., 2002).  Physical and 
chemical properties in the Okhotsk Sea have been 
studied but the optical properties of seawater has 
not been clarified in this region.  Understanding 
the bio-optical characteristics of seawater is 
essential and important for ocean color remote 
sensing.  Therefore we collected optical data sets 
during research cruises in the Okhotsk Sea in 2000 
(Fig. 1 and Table 1).  Our objective was to 
characterize the spatial variability of chlorophyll a 
and water column optical properties (i.e., in situ 
reflectance) and apply these data sets to ocean 
color remote sensing including development of 
regional bio-optical algorithm for the Okhotsk 
Sea. 
 
Data and methods 
Sampling 
Water and particulate samples were collected from 
the R/V Mirai and the R/V Kromov in the sampling 
stations shown in Figure 1.  The cruises were 
carried out from May 15 to June 6, 2000 (R/V 
Mirai) and from June 4 to June 28, 2000 (R/V 
Kromov).  Surface samples were collected by 
plastic bucket.  Water column irradiance and 
radiance measurements were performed at each 
station.  The data sources we observed are 
summarized in Table 1.  Station M3 is typical 
clear ocean water region as a reference in 
comparison with the water in the Okhotsk Sea. 
 
Chlorophyll a analysis   
For the determination of phytoplankton 
chlorophyll a, a 200 ml of water sample was 
filtered onto a Whatman GF/F (25mm) filters.  
The filter was immediately soaked in N, N-
dimethylformamide (DMF) were extracted in the 
dark (Suzuki and Ishimaru 1990).  The 
concentration of chlorophyll a was determined 
with a fluorometer (10-AU, Turner. Inc.) after 
extraction (Parsons et al. 1984).

Particulate analysis   
Particulate absorption, a
p
, spectra were determined 
using the quantitative filter pad technique (e.g., 
Mitchell and Kiefer 1990).  Seawater volumes of 
0.2 to 1 L water vacuum filtered through Whatman 
GF/F (25mm) filters.  The absorption of particles 
retained on the filter was determined over the 
spectral range 350 to 750 nm.  Triplicate spectra 
ware averaged and then zeroed using data 750 nm 
as a baseline.  A correction for multiple scattering 
by the filter (beta correction) was applied using the 
function derived by Cleveland and Weidemann 
(1993).  The spectral absorption coefficient (per 
meter) was calculated by accounting for the 
volume filtered and the effective area of the filter.  
To examine waveform difference, we normalized 
data sets at 440 nm or 490 nm. 
 
Remote sensing reflectance   
Submersible spectroradiometers (MER2040/2041 
and PRR600/610, Biospherical. Inc.) were used to 
measure upwelling radiance, L
u
( λ), and 
downwelling irradiance, E
d
( λ), simultaneously.  
The spectra data we observed are summarized in 
Table 2.  Downwelling irradiance and upwelling 
radiance were averaged every 1 m.  Values of 
E
d
( λ) and L
u
( λ) at just below the sea surface, E
d
( λ, 
0-) and L
u
( λ,0-), were defined as coefficients 
fitting the data between 0 and 10 m according to 
the following equations (Gordon et al. 1983): 
 
E
d
( λ, z) = E
d
( λ, 0-) · exp[- K
d
( λ) · z] (1) 
 
and 
 
L
u
( λ, z) = L
u
( λ, 0-) · exp[- K
u
( λ) · z] (2) 
 
where λ is wavelength, z is depth, K
d
( λ) is diffuse 
attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance, 
and K
u
( λ) is diffuse attenuation coefficient of 
upwelling radiance.  Water leaving radiance 
(Austin 1974), L
w
( λ), was calculated by following 
equation: 
 
L
w
( λ) = (t/n
w
2
) · L
u
( λ, 0-)          (3) 
 
where t is surface transmittance from sea to air, t 
and n
w
 are approximately 0.98 and 1.34, 
respectively (Austin, 1974).  Remote sensing 
reflectance (apply to the test of SeaWiFS 
algorithm and reflectance model), Rrs( λ), can be 
written the following equation: 
 
Rrs( λ) = L
w
( λ) / E
ds
( λ),           (4) 
 
where E
ds
( λ) is downwelling irradiance at just 
above the sea surface. 
 
Wavelength spectral bands of radiometers used in 
this study were different from each other (Table 
2).  The PRR600 do not have channels at 510 nm 
and 555nm.  Therefore we interpolated data sets 
from 510 nm to 520 nm and from 555 nm to 565 
nm using MER2040 data sets, which contain both 
wavelengths (Hirawake et al. 2000).

Results and discussion 
Remote sensing reflectance of each stations and 
normalized remote sensing reflectance at 490 nm 
are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.  Using 
Rrs spectral signatures, we could categorize to 
three groups:  M3 type represents clear ocean 
water as Case I, K4 type represents high 
chlorophyll a concentration water (refer to Table 
3) and K6 type represents high particulate 
materials concentration water.  
 
Normalized particulate absorption at 440 nm and 
the ratio between suspended materials absorption 
and total particulate absorption are shown in 
Figures 4 and 5, respectively.  M3 has a typical 
Case I spectral signature with high absorption at 
443 nm and 683 nm.  K4 and K6 has similar 
spectral signature but absorption at 683 nm is 
different.  Magnitude of absorption at 683 nm for 
K6 is lower than one for K4.  The ratio of a
d
/a
p
 of 
K6 is twice value (Fig. 5).  It is clear that K6 is 
strongly affected by absorption of suspended 
materials in comparison with the other stations.  
 
In the Okhotsk Sea, Case I type water (M3 type) 
exists at the station K3 and K7 near Sakhalin 
Island.  On the other hand, in the region with 
Amur River discharge effect, there are two kinds 
of water with bio-optical properties, high 
chlorophyll a concentration water (K4 type) and 
high suspended materials concentration water (K6 
type).  
 
We will discuss on application of these results to 
ocean color remote sensing more detail in the 
symposium.

Introduction 
Global information about the chl-a concentration 
at the ocean surface can be obtained by remote 
sensing of the optical spectrum range.  Deploying 
remote sensing equipment on aircraft or satellites 
make it possible to conduct such investigations.  
The existence of a correlation between chl-a 
concentration and the sea brightness spectrum was 
experimentally considered in Clarke (1970).  The 
possibility of developing a chl-a determination 
method by passive ocean remote sensing was 
thereby shown. 
 
The first Nimbus-7 satellite with a CZCS scanner 
on board collected information about ocean color 
from 1978 to 1986 (Tassan 1994).  The next 
satellites observing the ocean color were as 
follows:  FY-1A/B (1990-1991) with the VHRSR 
(Very High Resolution Scanning Radiometer);  
ADEOS (Advanced Earth Observing Satellite, 
1996-97) with the OCTS (Ocean Color and 
Temperature Scanner) (Mitomi et al. 1998).  
Nowadays information about ocean color is 
collected by satellites such as ROCSAT (launched 
in 1998) with OCI (Ocean Сolor Imager) scanner;  
OrbView-2 (launched in 1997) with a SeaWiFS 
scanner (Delu et al. 1998). 
 
The spectra of upwelling radiance from the surface 
water layer are registered by satellite sensors and 
translated at the storage and processing center of 
satellite information (GDAAC - Goddard 
Distributed Active Archive Center) or at 
autonomous stations for information reception 
(HRPT - High Resolution Picture Transmission).  
Thereupon these data are translated to level 2 data, 
i.e. to chl-a concentration, using bio-optical 
algorithms.  The more common choices are the 
algorithm of blue-green ratio.  It is based on the 
empirical chl-a concentration dependence on the 
spectral bands ratio of sea brightness in the blue-
green spectral region to determine the chl-a 
concentration.  However, existing bio-optical 
algorithms of chl-a concentration determination 
are not accurate and require verification and 
corrections, determined from comparisons of 
satellite and in situ ship data. 
 
For open sea and ocean waters, classed as Case-1, 
the discrepancy between chl-a concentrations from 
satellite versus ship-based estimates is 
significantly lower than for coastal regions.  So, 
for Case-1 waters, using the blue-green ratio 
algorithm, the error of chl-a concentration 
determination ranging in values from 0.5 to 50 
mg/m
3
 (McClain et al. 1992; Hooker et al. 2000) is 
more than 30%.  Discrepancies of the satellite 
estimates from ship-based ones can reach large 
values in the coastal regions where the water is 
more often classed as Case-2.  Here, the 
correlation between phytoplankton, and the 
content of suspended particles and yellow 
substances may exhibit large local spatial and 
temporal variations (Tassan, 1994).  For example, 
the error of chl-a concentration determined by the 
SeaWiFS scanner in the Case-2 waters of the 
southwestern part of the Barents Sea reaches 
2170%, i. e. the satellite data overestimate the ship 
ones in 22 times (Burrenkov et al. 2001).  Satellite 
data usually overestimate ship-based estimates in 
the coastal regions.  It is related to the 
predominance of suspended particles of organic 
origin and the yellow substances taken out by river 
flow from the sea coast. 
 
Methods 
Ship data   
Ship-based chl-a concentrations were obtained by 
sampling water during the cruises of the R/V 
Professor Gagarinsky (05.06.00-12.06.00) and the 
R/V Utyes (28.05.99-07.06.99), see Figure 1.  
Water sampling occurred within the euphotic zone 
using a Rosette multi-water sampler.

Chl a and pheophytin determination   
An integrated sample of the surface layer (at 2-3 
geographical coordinates) was taken while on 
station.  This was assumed to provide an area-
mean value for a region 1 km × 1 km.  Samples of 
1 - 1.5 liters in volume were filtered by 
“SARTORIUS” membrane filters of 35mm 
diameter with the cell making 0.6 mkm.  After 
filtration, the samples were frozen and preserved 
at –18ºC.  The chl-a concentration was measured 
by standard methods with preliminary extraction 
and determination of 90% acetone absorption 
spectra using a “SF-46” spectrophotometer 
(Anonymous 1990).  Hereafter, the designation of 
chl-a concentration is assumed to be the sum of 
chl-a and pheophytin concentrations. 
 
Satellite data   
Satellite chl-a concentration estimation, level 2 
data with GAC (4.48 km) resolution were taken 
from the storage and processing center of satellite 
information - GSFS-DAAC (Goddard Space 
Flight Center Distributed Active Archive Center).  
JHV 2.3 (Java HDF Viewer) browser was used for 
processing the satellite data (converting color 
codes with magnitudes from 0 to 255, to the 
numerical estimations of chl-a concentration 
related to geographical coordinates).  After JHV 
processing, the satellite data had a spatial 
resolution equal to about 9 km × 9 km. 
 
For estimating the error, determined by factors 1 
and 2, a comparison of the satellite chl- а 
concentrations and the area-mean of 9 km × 9 km 
and 1 km × 1 km area-mean was performed.  To 
do this, the data with space resolution of 1 km × 1 
km were ordered in the GSFC DAAC center and 
processed with the SeaDAS 4.1 (SeaWiFS Data 
Analysis System) software. 
 
Verification/correction of satellite data  
Difficulties arise in the selection of sets of ship 
and satellite chl-a concentrations that are unique to 
separate cases of the identical parameters 
 145
determining its color (particles of organic and 
terrestrial origin, yellow substances).  Such sets 
were determined from preliminary analysis of the 
distribution of chl-a concentration obtained by 
ship method.  Distinguishing zones of chl-a 
concentrations were made according to:  1) the 
proportionality coefficient of satellite and ship 
data;  2) chl-a content at the ship station;  and 3) 
the geographical location of a station (the distance 
from the coast).  
 
Least squares was used to determine the equations 
relating satellite and ship chl-a concentration 
estimates for each zone (“Statistics” programs 
package in Excel software).  Higher correlation 
coefficients were obtained with a simple quadratic 
model.  Critical values of the correlation 
coefficients were determined at a significance 
level of 5% (Table in Jonson et al. 1980).  
 
As the equations were constructed from small 
sample sizes, the statistical significance of the 
correlation coefficient in the equation was tested 
by the method reported in the Afifi et al. (1982).  
The Student t-test was used:

 is the mean square deviation of 
Z magnitude, and R is the correlation coefficient.  
 
When t > tcritical at a significance level of 5%, it 
was agreed that the tested correlation coefficients 
were significant.  The 5% level was chosen 
because it is optimum when it is necessary to 
choose between the most width of the confidence 
interval for chl-a concentrations and the lowest 
level of tcritical.  The results of the test on 
statistical significance for the obtained equations 
are given in Table 1.  The t values for all three 
equations are larger than t critical, which meets the 
condition for statistical significance of the 
correlation coefficients. 
 
The error of equation construction was determined 
from the formula:

δ δ δ + =               (2) 
 
where δ
1
 is  the absolute deviation for the ship data 
measured by the extractive spectrometric method, 
δ
2
 is the absolute deviation caused by the 
inaccuracy of the satellite data.  In the 
determination of chl-a concentration by the 
extractive spectrometric method, the measurement 
error varies depending on the pigment 
concentration in the sample.  A plot of the relative 
error against the chl-a concentration in the sample 
is presented in Vedernikov et al. (1973).  The 
accuracy of satellite chl-a concentrations are 
defined by the following factors: 
 
1. satellite chl-a concentration estimations are 
taken with area-averaging over 9 km × 9 km, 
while the ship ones are 1 km × 1 km; 
2. inaccurate relationship between the satellite 
data to the geographical coordinates; 
3. ship chl-a concentrations were taken from the 
surface layer while the upwelling ocean 
radiance coming on the satellite is integrated 
by the near-surface layers; 
4. Temporal displacement of ship and satellite 
estimates of chl-a concentration because 
satellite estimates are unavailable due to 
cloudiness for 2 days. 
 
For estimating the error caused by factors 1 and 2, 
a comparison of the satellite chl-a concentration 
estimations and the area-mean of 9 km × 9 km and 
1 km × 1 km area-mean was performed.  To do 
this, the data with space resolution of 1 km × 1 km 
were ordered in the GSFC DAAC center and 
processed by the SeaDAS 4.1 software. 
 
The influence of factor 3 on chl-a concentrations 
was evaluated by comparing chl-a concentrations 
from the ocean surface layer (C) with the 
parameter of <C>.  Parameter of <C> takes into 
account the fact that the ocean radiance coming to 
the satellite is integrated by the near-surface water 
layers.  This parameter was calculated by the 
formula, cited in Gordon (1983):

Results and discussion  
There were 14 estimates, averaged over 9 km × 9 
km, of satellite-derived chl-a concentration that 
corresponded with ship samples obtained from the 
same region by the R/V Professor Gagarinskiy on 
cloudless days.  As the conditions changed along 
transects run perpendicular to the coast, the water 
surface was divided into three zones, designated as 
sea, intermediate and coastal.  There were small 
and comparable chl-a concentrations in the sea 
and coastal zones.  At the same time, they differed 
by their proportionality coefficient of satellite and 
ship estimations.  In the sea zone, it varied 
between 0.8 and 2.5, whereas in the coastal zone, 
between 2.7 and 5.4).  The intermediate zone was 
distinguished from first two zones by its greater 
chl-a concentrations (3.5-6.81 mg/m
3
).  Variations 
of values of the satellite (Csattel) and ship (Cship) 
chl-a concentrations and their proportionality 
coefficient (K) are presented in Table 1. 
 
Verification of the satellite chl-a concentration 
estimations has shown that they are overestimated, 
moreso in the coastal zones than elsewhere (Table 
2).  For this reason, the correction of the satellite 
chl-a concentration estimations from ship-based 
estimates is essential.  To do such correction, the 
equations relating satellite and ship chl-a 
concentrations were obtained.  Presented below 
are the equations subject to factors 1-4, 
determining the accuracy of them:

Tests of statistical significance of the correlation 
coefficient in the equations yielded positive 
results.  According to the calculation the parameter 
of t for all three equations is larger than t critical, 
which meets the condition for the statistical 
significance of the correlation coefficients (Table 
3). 
 
A comparison of the satellite data area averaged 
over 9 km × 9 km and 1 km × 1 km was performed 
to account for the spatial heterogeneity of chl-a 
concentration distribution.  To take into account 
the heterogeneity of chl-a distribution in depth, a 
comparison of chl-a concentration from the 
surface layer with the parameter <C> was 
performed. 
 
In summary, the maximum error (18.7%) in chl-a 
concentration estimates, determined by factors 1, 2 
occurred at station 13.  The maximum error by 
factor 3 (24%) was observed at station 4 where a 
sharp decrease of chl-a concentration occurred 
with depth.  Both of the above mentioned stations 
are settled in the intermediate zone.  Therefore, the

accuracy of calibration equation for the given zone 
at δ1=18% (Vedernikov 1973), δ2 = 19%+24% is 
46.6%.  The error for the satellite data that are not 
calibrated is 9.9%.  It is less than the error of the 
equation construction.  That is why the calibration 
equation for the data of this zone was not used.  
For the coastal and sea zones the error determined 
by factors 1 and 2 was not above 9.2% (station 
12), whereas maximum deviation of C from <C> 
(9.8%) occurred at the station 2 which settled in 
the coastal zone because of the influence DCM.  
Thus the accuracy of the calibration equation for 
this zone was 26%.  In the sea zone, the difference 
between C and <C> did not exceed 4.2% at station 
6 and the accuracy of the calibration equation 
equaled 23%.  The error of the chl-a estimates for 
the uncalibrated coastal zone data was 256% and 
for the sea zone – 42.6%.  After calibration it 
decreased to 37.5% and 22.3%, respectively. 
 
The calibration equations were also used to correct 
the satellite data obtained during the R/V Utyes 
cruise.  After correction, the errors were 
significantly decreased for the stations located in 
the region for which the equations were 
constructed.  High errors were observed at stations 
1, 2, and 9 (Table 4).  Stations 1, 2 are located in 
the region where satellite chl-a estimates were 
absent because of cloudiness.  The chl-a 
concentration value at station 9 exceeds the limits 
of the range of values for which the equation was 
constructed.  This range is from 3 to 6.1 mg/m
3
, 
while at station 9 it equals to 1.2 mg/m

Conclusion 
The study area is exposed to the sea coast where 
particles of organic and inorganic material, 
together with river flow, influence the optical 
characteristics of seawater.  The correlation 
between phytoplankton, suspended particles, and 
yellow substances may exhibit large local spatial 
and temporal variations.  As a consequence of 
the heterogeneity, the water must be divided into 
separate zones to estimate chl-a concentration 
estimations from satellite data. 
 
In most cases, the estimates of chl-a 
concentration obtained from satellite data, in 
waters near the coast, have been overestimated 
(one error in the coastal zone reached 256%).  
This is why calibrating satellite chl-a estimates 
from in situ sampling is necessary.  In the 
regions with large gradients of chl-a 
concentration, a comparison of ship and satellite 
chl-a concentrations, area-averaged over 9 km × 
9 km may give incorrect results.  Thus a 
comparison with the satellite data having a 
spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km is necessary in 
the regions with a heterogeneous pattern of chl-a 
concentration.  When correcting satellite chl-a 
concentration estimates, there is also a need to 
take into account the vertical profiles of chl-a 
concentration.  For instance, the difference of 
the chl-a concentration at the water surface from 
the depth-averaged “translucence” from satellite 
was 24%.  This error appeared because of a 
sharp decrease of chl-a concentration with 
depth. 
 
The application of the calibration equations 
constructed from data collected in 2000 to 
satellite chl-a estimates for 1999, for the most 
part, increased errors.  However, there were 
stations where a decreased error was observed.  
The reason is that:  1) the chl-a concentrations 
did not fall within the range of values from 
which the equation was constructed;  and 2) the 
stations are located in the southern part of 
Sakhalin, whereas the equations were 
constructed from data obtained from stations at 
the northern part of the island.

Introduction 
The Sea of Okhotsk experiences not only spring 
blooms but also fall blooms, a phenomenon that is 
characteristic of temperate regions.  Both types of 
blooms influence the seasonal variability of chl-a 
concentrations.  In the past, however, there were 
few studies about chl-a distribution in the Sea of 
Okhotsk (e.g. Nezlin et al., 1997, Saitoh et al. 
1996).  We use multi-sensor remote sensing to 
analyze the seasonal and interannual variability of 
chlorophyll a (chl-a) distributions in the Sea of 
Okhotsk between 1998 and 2001.  Our objectives 
are:  1) to examine the possibility of ice-edge 
bloom and open-water bloom and their spatial and 
interannual characteristics in the Okhotsk Sea after 
sea ice retreat, and 2) to understand the aerial and 
year-to-year characteristics of variability of chl-a. 
 
Satellite data  
The satellite data used are summarized in Table 1.  
We obtained Sea Wide Field-of-view Scanner 
(SeaWiFS; v4)-derived chl-a concentration data 
for eight days over the period February 1998 to 
June 2001, in addition to monthly (January 1998 – 
December 2001) composite global standard 
mapped images from NASA Goddard Space Flight 
Center’s Distributed Active Archive Center 
(DAAC).  Chl-a data sets have a spatial resolution 
of about 9 × 9 km.  To investigate the seasonal and 
interannual variability, we used monthly 
composite chl-a data.  For the analysis of spring 
bloom (ice-edge and open-water), we used 
composite chl-a data from eight day periods.  We 
obtained chl-a concentration data for each month 
(eight day) from 1998 to 2001, and generated 
images of the highest and lowest values to 
investigate periods of phytoplankton blooms.  As a 
result of cloud cover, some data points were 
missing from the eight-day chl-a concentration 
data set.  To better estimate the highest and lowest 
chl-a concentrations, spatial interpolation was 
used if more than three normal data points 
surrounded eight grid points in the eight-day mean 
chl-a image.  SeaWiFS-derived eight-day 
composite photosynthetically active radiation 
(PAR) data sets (9 × 9 km) were also obtained 
from DAAC.  Advanced Very High Resolution 
Radiometer (AVHRR)-derived eight-day

composite sea surface temperature (SST) data 
obtained from National Oceanic and Atmospheric

Microwave Imager (SSM/I)-derived sea ice 
concentration data obtained from National Snow 
and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), Distributed Active 
Archive Center, University of Colorado, Boulder, 
CO, U.S.A.  The data sets that we obtained had 
had the bootstrap algorithm applied to them 
(Comiso 1986; Comiso and Sullivan 1986). 
 
Method 
To distinguish between bloom types, we used the 
period from sea ice retreat to spring bloom 
occurrence.  The period of ice retreat was defined 
as the period when the percent coverage by ice 
reached zero.  The spring bloom was defined as 
the period of highest chl-a concentrations.  Both 
images are 9-km equal-angle grids, so each pixel 
in the two images has a corresponding counterpart.  
We defined ice-edge and open-water blooms as 
phenomena that typically continue for at least one 
week.  Considering the time interval of one period 
of chl-a measurement (8 days), two possible 
extremes existed for ice-edge blooms:  (a) sea ice 
retreated very early within the eight days, and the 
bloom occurred within the same interval;  or (b) 
sea ice retreated late during the eight-day interval, 
and the bloom continued over the next eight days.  
We defined both cases as ice-edge blooms.  Open-
water blooms, therefore, were defined as spring 
blooms that did not occur as either of these cases. 
 
To investigate the seasonal and interannual 
variability in the distribution of phytoplankton, we 
used the Binary Decision Tree classifier (BDT) 
method.  We classified seasonal and interannual 
variability in monthly chl-a concentrations into 
eight classes based on three criteria:  (1) the 
highest monthly chl-a concentration associated 
with phytoplankton bloom (threshold = 3.0 mg· 
m
-3
);  (2) the lowest monthly chl-a concentration 
associated with nutrient depletion (threshold = 0.3 
mg·m
-3
);  and (3) the periods of highest monthly 
chl-a concentration associated with phytoplankton 
blooms (threshold = before July and after August). 
 
Results and discussion 
Throughout the four-year study, ice-edge blooms 
occurred predominantly on the northeast shelf 
(ice-edge blooms dominated in 1998 and 1999;

and in the southwest (ice-edge bl0oms dominated 
in 1999 and 2001;  open-water blooms dominated 
in 1998 and 2000) (Fig. 1).  The most important 
factor required to characterize spatial and temporal 
variability of spring blooms is the timing of sea ice 
retreat, while a secondary factor is the adjustment 
of insolation.  Based on this adaptation to light, the 
mechanics of ice-edge blooms in the Sea of 
Okhotsk may resemble results observed in the 
Bering Sea (Niebauer et al., 1990) but different 
from the result of the Chukchi Sea (Hameedi 
1978).

the seasonal distribution of chl-a into six 
provinces.  Province A is characterized by high

from the Amur River. Province C occupies areas 
off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula 
throughout the four study years, and its 
distribution shows large year-to-year variability, 
ranging from 10.3-19.5%.  Province D and E are 
characterized, particularly in the southwestern 
area, by their relation to sea ice distribution and 
ice-edge blooms.  Province F, is located in the 
central basin, has the lowest monthly minimum 
chl-a concentration (<0.4 mg·m

provinces (Figs. 2, 3).  Our results suggest that the 
magnitude of ice-edge blooms affects the extent of 
primary productivity in the Sea of Okhotsk 
through atmosphere-ice-ocean coupled influences 
on biological processes.  A more quantitative 
approach using a physical-biological coupled 
model is required to better understand energy 
transfer and the carbon budget in the Sea of 
Okhotsk.

Introduction 
The Okhotsk Sea is one of the most biologically 
productive regions in the world, and it supports 
high fisheries production.  It has been reported that 
diatoms are a major component of the 
phytoplankton in this sea (e.g. Hanzawa et al. 
1981).  Previous observations revealed maximum 
diatom cell numbers in spring and minima in 
autumn.  Shiomoto (1997) showed that 
picoplankton (<2µm) and nanoplankton (2-10µm) 
(small-sized phytoplankton) generally contributed 
greatly to Chl-a concentration in more than 70% 
of the southern part of the Okhotsk Sea in late 
autumn (October) and early winter (November).  
Previous studies did not discuss thoroughly the 
factors in determining the spatial distribution of 
the phytoplankton in autumn and spring bloom 
periods and the effect of the sea ice on the spring 
bloom in the Okhotsk Sea.  
 
Using a three-dimensional ecosystem model for 
the Okhotsk Sea, we attempt to discuss questions 
such as:  What is the most important process to 
control the autumn and spring bloom?  How much 
does the amount of sea ice effect on the spring 
bloom? 
 
Model 
A three dimensional ecosystem-physical coupled 
model is applied to the Okhotsk Sea.  For the 
physical model, we use a sigma-coordinate model 
by developed at Harvard University called 
Harvard Ocean Prediction System (Lozano et al. 
1994; Robinson 1996).  Parameterization of 
Pacanowski and Philander (1981) is adopted to 
calculate vertical diffusivity and viscosity.  For the 
ecosystem model, we use NEMURO, which is 
coupled with the physical model.  NEMURO is a 
nitrogen- and silica-based model with eleven 
compartments.  This ecosystem model has eleven 
compartments including two categories of 
phytoplankton (diatoms and small phytoplankton 
other than diatoms) and three categories of 
zooplankton (small, large and predatory 
zooplankton). 
 
Results and discussion 
Autumn bloom  The model was run through 
October and November in 1996 for 30 days.  
Small-phytoplankton (PS) contribution to Chl-a 
concentration accounted for more than 65% in this 
study.  The simulated distributions of PS (mg Chl-
a/l) agreed with observations.  Chl-a concentration 
is high in the east of Sakhalin Island and low in 
the southern part of the Okhotsk Sea.  East of 
Sakhalin Island, a very shallow mixed layer 
develops because the salinity of the surface water 
is reduced by the discharge from the Amur River.  
Because of a very shallow mixed layer, net 
primary production is high in the surface layer.  
On the other hand, in the southern Okhotsk Sea, 
Chl-a concentration is low because the deep mixed 
layer reduces the growth efficiency of phyto-
plankton.  However, net primary production is not 
extremely lower in this area than in other high 
Chl-a areas.  Thus, Chl-a concentration distri-
bution does not necessarily reflect net primary 
production in the Sea of Okhotsk in autumn. 
 
Spring bloom   
An ecosystem-physical coupled model included 
sea ice effects (light condition under ice, moment 
and salinity flux between ice and sea).  But, 
nutrient fluxes between ice and sea are not 
considered.  Thickness of the sea ice is estimated 
from satellite data (Tateyama 2001).

The model was run through winter and spring in 
1997 (a year with lesser ice-cover) and in 2001 
(a year with large ice-cover).  According to the 
model results, the total stock of Si(OH)
4
 in the 
surface layer (0-20 m) in March 2001 is a larger 
than that in 1997 by about 10%.  Vertical mixing 
of water column develops when the sea ice 
grows.  However, the total stock of Si(OH)
4
 in 
the surface was not much different between 
1997 and 2001.  It suggests that the growth of 
sea ice may be not important for supplying 
nutrients to the sea surface.  We can reproduce 
the spatial distribution of phytoplankton at the 
spring bloom in 1997, 2001 in the Okhotsk Sea by a 
three dimensional ecosystem-physical coupled 
model (Figs. 1 and 2 in 2001).  From the model, the 
arrival of the spring bloom in the Okhotsk Sea is a 
consequence of an increase of photosynthetic rate 
both in 1997 and 2001.  So, the photosynthetic rate 
of phytoplankton depends on the light environment 
in the euphotic zone from winter and spring in 
Okhotsk Sea.  The light intensity under the sea ice is 
too low.  The timing of sea ice melting may effect a 
time-lag of spring bloom, and have an effect on the 
spatial distribution of phytoplankton in the Okhotsk 
Sea.

Distribution patterns for the gonatid squid Gonatus madokai in the Okhotsk 
Sea in spring 2002

Squids of the family Gonatidae are of major 
importance in the North Pacific Ocean, being 
highly abundant in pelagic communities all over 
the vast boreal zone (Nesis 1973, 1997; Okutani et 
al. 1988).  At the same time, taxonomy of the 
gonatid squids remains poorly developed largely 
due to the fact that there is scarce information on 
mature stages for most of the species encountered 
in the family.  Taxonomic problems, in turn, 
produce a lot of uncertainty in evaluation of 
significance of a particular species in complex 
pelagic assemblages.  Up to 9 species from all 
three genera of the gonatid family are found in the 
Okhotsk Sea, namely:  Berryteuthis magister (one 
of the most abundant demersal species), 
Berryteuthis anonychus (occasionally observed 
epipelagic species), Gonatopsis borealis (very 
abundant epi- and mesopelagic species), 
Gonatopsis octopedatus (rarely caught though 
probably abundant species in the bathypelagic 
zone), Gonatopsis japonicus (rarely though 
regularly observed bathypelagic species in the 
deep-water areas), Gonatus tinro (rather common 
mesopelagic species), Gonatus kamtschaticus 
(rarely caught mesopelagic species), Gonatus onyx 
(rarely caught meso- and bathypelagic species), 
and Gonatus madokai (rather common eurybathic 
species).  Information on life history of most of 
those species is scarce.  We have gathered detailed 
data on occurrence and biology of the squid 
G. madokai in order to reveal whether distribution 
of different life stages reflects the species life 
history.  Hence, our main objectives were to look 
at distribution of different ontogenetic stages of 
this squid, and to relate the observed patterns with 
physical and biological environmental characters 
such as currents, temperature, pycnocline, prey 
availability. 
 
Geographical range of G. madokai covers almost 
the entire subarctic Pacific area, including the 
Okhotsk Sea where the squid frequently occurs in 
epi-, meso-, and bathypelagic tows (Kubodera and 
Okutani 1977; Nesis 1997).  An increase of the 
squid average size with depth has been noticed in 
the Okhotsk Sea, and both diel vertical migrations 
and ontogenetic descent were suspected (Nesis 
1997).  In spite of considerable amount of 
information collected on the squid occurrence and 
biology, little is known about its distributional 
patterns and life cycle.  Mostly juveniles and 
immature adults of G. madokai have been caught 
so far with only occasional occurrence of mature 
males and gaining maturity females (Kubodera 
and Okutani 1977; Nesis 1997).  No fully mature 
or spent females have been registered until 
recently (Katugin and Merzlyakov 2002). 
Gelatinous degeneration of tissues has been 
reported only for females, and it starts presumably 
before the onset of maturation (Nesis 1998; 
Katugin and Merzlyakov 2002).  Herein, we 
present new data on G. madokai different life 
stages distribution across almost the entire 
Okhotsk Sea, with particular attention to our 
findings of degenerated gelatinous spent females, 
and their occurrence.  The material examined was 
collected by sampling program of TINRO-Centre 
during annual survey in the Okhotsk Sea from 
March till early June, 2002, on the research vessel 
RV Professor Kaganovskyi employing midwater 
trawl 53/360 (40 m horizontal spread at a trawling 
speed of 3.5 knots on the average) with a 12 mm 
mesh liner in the cod end.  Epi- and mesopelagic 
layers down to 450 m depth were investigated by 
trawling hauls. 
 
During the survey, a total of 636 individuals of G. 
madokai were caught, 548 of them immature.  The 
rest 88 specimens were large spent females (Fig. 
1).  No either fully mature or spent male was 
registered.  Immature squid ranged in size from 25 
to 240 mm DML.  Exact size of spent females was 
hard to evaluate due to serious damage of 
gelatinous and watery bodies in the net (most

specimens appeared on board the RV with their 
fins torn off, and mantles broken), and hence 
gladius length (GL) was measured where possible.  
GL of 21 spent females with intact gladii ranged 
from 308 to 385 mm (mean 350.33 mm, mode 340 
mm).  No individuals with intermediate sizes and 
with developing reproductive system were present 
in the trawling hauls.  The presence of only 
immature and spent animals in the epi- and 
mesopelagic hauls may suggest that at the onset of 
sexual maturation the squid descend to deeper 
bathypelagic zone, that was not covered by the 
trawling operations. 
 
Large senescent females were totally spent with 
only occasional ripe oocytes (ovoid in shape, and 
up to 5 mm maximum length) present in the 
oviducts, and with exhausted dark yellow ovaries.  
Bodies of spent females were swelled and 
gelatinous in appearance:  mantle wall approxi-
mately 10 mm thick, all arms of about 30 mm 
thick at their bases.  No tentacles were present, 
only their small, approximately 10 mm long 
remnants were left, suggesting that tentacles were 
autotomized earlier, presumably at the onset of 
maturation.  Only hooks were left on the arms, and 
shreds of dark brown to black tissue were 
associated with the hooks of arms I-III in some 
animals, which we suppose are remnants of egg-
masses that females carry attached to their arms.

depth. 
 
Two strikingly different patterns of G. madokai 
distribution in the Okhotsk Sea were revealed 
during the spring trawl survey, and were clearly 
associated with the squid life-cycle stages.  First 
type of distribution was characteristic for juveniles 
and immature growing up adults.  These young 
and advanced life stages of G. madokai did not 
show differences in their distributional patterns, 
and occurred unevenly within the entire sea, with 
incidental catches over great depths in the 
southern Okhotsk Sea and shelf areas (Fig. 2).  
Young squid formed comparatively high 
concentrations in several highly productive areas 
of the Okhotsk Sea, mostly in its northern part, 
particularly, in the Shelikhov Bay, north of 
Kashevarov Bank, in northern Sakhalin frontal 
zone.  Concentrations of juvenile squid were also 
found off the southwestern Kamchatka over 
Lebedev Bank, and along the eastern Sakhalin 
outer shelf.  All these regions are areas with 
complex hydrodynamic systems such as 
upwellings, counter-currents, frontal zones.  We 
may suggest that young and advanced immature 
life stages of G. madokai gather predominantly in 
areas with high abundance of food organisms 
required for the squid rapid growth.  Squid in 
general are known to be active opportunistic 
carnivores at all stages (Nixon 1987).  Few data on 
stomach contents of G. madokai suggest that the 
species consumes crustaceans, fish and squid, 
though its food items also include chaetognaths 
(Sagitta spp.), and salps (Nesis 1997).  Occurrence 
of young and immature adult stages of G. madokai 
appeared associated with distribution patterns of 
the species potential prey, such as dominant 
zooplankton groups within the Okhotsk Sea:  
euphausiids (Thysanoessa raschii and T. longipes), 
copepods (Neocalanus plumchrus) and 
chaetognaths (Sagitta elegans). 
 
Quite different type of distribution was 
characteristic for spent females of G. madokai, and 
was evidently associated with general circulation 
pattern and water mass structure.  Spent females 
occurred in constantly low quantities (one to 
several animals per hour trawling) in the southern 
Okhotsk Sea, along western Kamchatka area, and 
all over northern Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 3).  In total, 
12% of all hauls contained spent G. madokai, and 
of those positive hauls 63% were taken in the 
northern Okhotsk Sea.  On the average, 2.44 
animals per positive haul were present, with a 
mode of 1, and a maximum of 12 animals per haul.  
No differences in the squid occurrence in epi- and 
mesopelagic layers were observed suggesting that 
the animals were possibly caught during taking the 
net on board the RV from rather narrow upper part 
of the water column.  Most spent individuals were 
caught over the slope area bounded by 200 and 
500 m depth contours, with only few catches on 
the shelf (northern Okhotsk Sea) and over deep 
regions (southern Okhotsk Sea).  Geographic 
range of spent females in the Okhotsk Sea 
generally coincided with the area covered by 
waters of the Western Kamchatka Current (WKC).  
This strong current, carrying comparatively warm 
and high salinity Pacific Ocean water, enters the 
Okhotsk Sea through the Kruzenshtern Pass, and 
forms two major streams, with variable strength 
and position depending on season and year.  In the 
spring 2002, both WKC streams were well 
developed. Pacific waters penetrated far north into 
 161
the northern Okhotsk Sea through the Kashevarov 
Bank with the western WKC branch, and through 
the TINRO Basin – with the eastern WKC flow. 
Northern cyclonic circulation, and southward 
Compensatory Countercurrent along the 
Kamchatka coast appeared weakly expressed.  
Warming up was observed within the pycnocline, 
and warm water at 100 m depth was distributed as 
far to the north as 58˚N both in the western and 
eastern parts of the northern Okhotsk Sea, 
coinciding with the northern boundary for G. 
madokai spent females range. 
 
Of particular interest is that though confined to the 
WKC system, spent females of G. madokai were 
found in the regions with comparatively low 
hydrodynamics, dwelling apart from areas with 
disturbing physical factors such as strong 
horizontal flows and upwellings.  Spent animals 
were observed outside the main streams with high 
velocities, e.g., on the edge of comparatively weak 
eastern branch of WKC, and at the periphery of 
eddies, e.g., upon the TINRO Basin, and to the 
west of Kashevarov Bank. 
 
We may suggest that spent females were confined 
to relatively warm intermediate (dichothermal) 
layer, and their distribution pattern generally 
coincided with positive temperature isotherms at 
depths of about 100 m.  Moreover, several 
biological considerations, concerning primarily 
such items as buoyancy, energetics and presumed 
baby-care burden, suggested that senescent spent 
females with high water content in muscle tissues 
aggregated predominantly within a restricted zone 
of water column that could provide better 
conditions for them.  This should be rather warm 
layer with comparatively high gradient in water 
density.  Pycnocline with positive temperatures 
must have provided suitable habitat for spent 
females to effectively (with a minimum loss of 
energy) reside during prolonged egg-brooding 
period, while geostrophic currents provided 
transportation routes and barriers for water-logged 
medusa-like females within the vast areas of the 
Okhotsk Sea thus forming the observed pattern of 
their spatial distribution. 
As a result, our main findings concerning 
distribution patterns of G. madokai in the Okhotsk 
Sea were as follows:  1) immature and spent 
individuals were distributed in different manner;  
2) immature animals were distributed according to 
prey availability;  3) spent females carrying egg-
masses were distributed in relation to hydrological 
conditions such as currents, temperature, and 
pycnocline, thus suggesting that they lead rather 
passive life, floating within the favorable zone of 
the water column, presumably within 
comparatively warm layer of density change.

Distribution and biomass of Boreopacific gonate squid (Gonatopsis borealis, 
Sasaki, 1929) in the Okhotsk Sea and Pacific waters off the Kuril Islands 
during the winter period

The boreopacific gonate squid, or northern 
gonatopsis, is a robust, muscular, nektonic 
gregarious squid.  G. borealis is one of the most 
common and most widely distributed gonatids 
(Nesis 1997).  This work is based on five complex 
trawl surveys of the Okhotsk Sea and three in the 
Pacific waters off the Kuril Islands during winter 
periods.  The purpose of this work was to ascertain 
the regularities in distribution of the boreopacific 
gonate squid. 
 
The Okhotsk Sea, especially around the Kuril 
islands, region is a very complex hydrodynamical 
region.  A current passes from East Kamchatka 
along the Kuril islands to south the Kuril.  
Through the northern Kuril straits, the Kuril 
Current enters the Okhotsk Sea and forms the 
West Kamchatka Current.  From the west, through 
the La Perouse Strait, the Soya Current penetrates 
into the southern Okhotsk Sea.  The southern part 
of the Soya Current paaes through Bussol’ Strait, 
meeting the Kuril Current and forming the 
Oyashio Current.  The important influence of the 
hydrodynamic regime in the Okhotsk Sea waters 
makes the warm Soya Current and the cool Kuril 
Current (Istoki Oyashio, 1997). 
 
In the Okhotsk Sea, G. borealis occurs mostly 
south of 58°N, avoiding the shelf zone along the 
north coast.  In different years, abundance of G. 
borealis varied in the epipelagic layer from 13.25 
kg km
-2
 during the winter of 1990/91 to 149.5 kg 
km
-2
 at the end of 1995.  In the mesopelagic layer, 
abundance varied from 55.3 kg km
-2
 along the 
western part of the Kamchatka Peninsula in 1995, 
to 132.5 kg km
2
 in the southern part of the 
Okhotsk Sea in 1991.  In the northern regions of 
the Okhotsk Sea, where the surface waters are 
cool, the northern gonatopsis was observed in the 
mesopelagic layer.  On the whole, especially in the 
southern part of the Okhotsk Sea, the boreopacific 
gonate squid is rather uniformly distributed, not 
forming large shoals (Fig. 1., Table 1). 
 
The Kuril Current influences the density of the 
northern gonatopsis in the dynamic waters of the 
Kuril Islands.  Frequency occurrence of the 
boreopacific gonate squid was approximately 78% 
in tows in the mesopelagic layer and 40% in the 
epipelagic layer.  Nevertheless, density and 
biomass of G. borealis in the epipelagic layer are 
usually higher than in the mesopelagic layer 
(Table 1). 
 
In the epipelagic Pacific waters off the Kuril 
islands, boreopacific gonate squid is capable of 
forming large shoals.  Near the central and the 
northern Kuril islands, large shoals of the northern 
gonatopsis squid occurred in epipelagic layer, 
about 16 t km
-2
 near Lopatka Cape at the end of 
1991 (Fig. 1G).  Also a large amount of 
boreopacific gonate squid (> 3 t km
-2
) was noted in 
Bussol’ Strait at the end of 1995 (Fig. 1F). 
 
In the open Pacific waters of the central Kuril 
islands during the winter of 1994/95, a large 
amount of northern gonatopsis was noted, about 8 
t km
-2
 (Fig. 1H).  Consequently, in the open 
Pacific waters near the Kuril islands, G. borealis is 
capable of forming large aggregations. 
 
Conclusions 
• In the Okhotsk Sea, south of 58°N, G. borealis 
density is distributed evenly, and the thick 
aggregations are not formed.  
• North of 58°N, G. borealis is practically 
absent, avoiding the coastal shelf zone. 
• One can frequently encounter G. borealis on 
the Pacific side of the Kuril islands in the 
mesopelagic layer, but its occurrence in large 
aggregations are found in the epipelagic layer.

Migrations of Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus, Gadidae) in the Okhotsk Sea

Former research of migration patterns of Pacific 
cod (Gadus macrocephalus) suggested that Pacific 
cod do not migrate outside the Okhotsk Sea.  The 
data showed that during the summer period, cod 
stays within the coastal western Kamchatka area at 
fairly low depths, and by winter, it moves to 
deeper waters on the outer shelf.  At the same 
time, cod can migrate along the western 
Kamchatka shelf for up to 230 miles.  Later 
research provided new data and introduced some 
corrections to the known scheme of migration 
pattern in that cod can also migrate into the 
Okhotsk Sea from the eastern Kamchatka coast.

Fig. 1 Average long-standing dynamics of 
Pacific cod catches by month from 1995-2002:  A 
- off the western Kamchatka coast, B- on the 
Pacific side of the northern Kuril Islands. 
We used daily baseline information on SSD 
(vessel-days of catch) from the period 1995-2002, 
comprising a total of 24571 vessel-days.  The 
investigation area covered the Kamchatka coast of 
the Okhotsk Sea, and the North Kuril islands 
between 50° and 58°N latitudes and 153° and 
157°E longitudes.  Data from the Pacific side of 
the Kuril islands were bounded on the north by 
49° and 50°N latitudes. 
 
The catch distribution by month was calculated 
from catch km
-2
 of the area covered.  The total 
area was split into squares with sides equal to ½° 
latitudinal/longitudinal.  The total catch of cod 
within each square was related to its area.  The 
resultant catch distribution patterns generally 
coincide with distribution patterns obtained from 
trawling surveys, made during the same period. 
 
Monthly dynamics of cod distribution were 
revealed.  Along the western Kamchatka coast, the 
maximum catch of cod occurred in February, 
comprising 20.7% of the average annual catch 
(Fig. 1).  The catch declines during the following 
months, reaching a minimum in October, when it 
makes up only 1.1% of the average annual catch.  
After that, the catch increases up to February, 
when it starts to rise sharply.  The fishery for cod 
off western Kamchatka is distributed 
correspondingly and has its own cycle (Fig. 2).  
The largest area is covered by winter fishery.  In 
January and February, the area with catches over 
10 kg km
-2
 is the largest, and stretches from the 
southernmost part of the Kamchatka Peninsula 
northward to 56° N.  During the following months, 
the area where fishery operates shrinks 
considerably, and in October the cod fishery 
remains only on the small area near Paramushir 
and Shumshu islands, and on the southern tip of 
Kamchatka.  The fishery area starts to expand in 
November and December.

northern Kuril Islands has two peaks during a 
year.  One peak is in March with 15.2%, and the 
other is in September with 13.3% of the annual 
catch within this area.  The lowest catch is in June 
and November, with 5.8% and 9.1% of the local 
annual catch, respectively.  These peaks do not 
coincide with catch peaks along the western 
Kamchatka coast, and may be attributed to cod 
migrating through the Kuril straits.  The peak in 
March is produced by cod migrating from the 
Okhotsk Sea, while that in November, by cod 
migrating into the Okhotsk Sea.  This suggestion 
is verified by the fact that in the Okhotsk Sea, cod 
catch drops in the first case, and increases in the 
second case. 
 
As a result, we think there exists solid evidence 
that cod inhabiting eastern Kamchatka shelf in 
summer migrates to winter into the Okhotsk Sea.

The eastern Sakhalin shelf is a traditional fishing 
ground for many species of fish and invertebrates, 
and the feeding grounds of grey whales are located 
here (Sobolevsky et al. 2000).  However, there 
have been no large-scale investigations of 
macrobenthos in the area since 1977 (Koblikov 
1978, 1983; Averintsev et al. 1982).  During this 
long period, commercial exploitation of oil 
deposits began in northeastern Sakhalin.  For this 
reason, some small areas of the shelf, located just 
near the oil drilling, were studied (Belan and 
Oleinik 2000).  In the summer of 2002, a large-
scale survey was conducted by TINRO-Center 
over the whole East Sakhalin shelf with 95 benthic 
stations ranging in depth from 15-280 m.  Station 
locations were located at the same points as in 
1977 (Fig. 1a).  Quantitative samples were 
collected using a bottom probe “Ocean-50” 
(quadrat size: 0.25 m
2
), and qualitative samples 
were collected using a Sigsbee trawl.  The samples 
were processed by standard methods of benthos 
sample processing (Neiman 1983). 
 
Within the studied region, total biomass of benthos 
fluctuated in the range 19 - 4450 g m
-2
 with 
average 421.50±58.7 g m
-2
 (the range was 9-2170 
g m
-2
 with an average of 339.12±42.09 g m
-2
 in 
1977).  Benthos had the highest abundance - >1 kg 
m
-2
 in the central part of the shelf between 52-
53°N at a depth of 50-150 m in the same area as in 
1977 (Fig. 1b).  The most usual concentration was 
100-500 g m
-2
.  The most common taxonomic 
groups of macrobenthos in both surveys were sea 
urchins, bivalves and polychaetas.  Sipunculida, 
Ophiuraidea, and Amphipoda were abundant in 
1977, but Cirripedia, Sipunculida, Amphipoda, 
and Spongia in 2002 (Table 1). 
 
The biomass of sea urchins in 2002 fluctuated 
from 1 to 2005 g m
-2
.  Their share was slightly 
lower than in 1977 (Table 1).  The distribution of 
sea urchins was similar in both years, but they 
were not found south of 51°N and had lower 
abundance northward from this latitude.  The 
location of their concentrations had not changed 
(Fig. 1c).  Up to 95% of sea urchins biomass was 
represented by Echinarachnius parma.  
 
Bivalves were distributed over the whole region of 
study with concentrations located as before, with 
slight increases in biomass. It fluctuated from 0.02 
to 666.5 g m
-2
 (Fig. 1d) and was the highest at 
51°N at a depth of 50 m, where Serripes 
groenlandicus dominated in silted sand.  This 
species represented 94% of bivalve biomass. 
 
Polychaeta species were observed everywhere 
with concentrations of 0.06-201.2 g m
-2
 (Fig. 1e).  
Relative to 1977, areas with Polychaeta biomass 
>100 g m
-2
  became larger.  Axiatella catenata 
dominated in both periods, but some other species 
were abundant in 2002. 
 
Amphipods were spread over the whole shelf with 
concentrations of 0.02-645.4 g m
-2
.  Their 
distribution was distinguished by three areas of 
heightened abundance (Fig. 1f) and was similar in 
two years of surveys, in particular in the central 
part of the shelf at 52°N, where Ampelisca 
eschrichti dominated permanently (>500 g/m
2
). 
 
The biomass of Sipunculida fluctuated in the range 
0.02-385.1 g m
-2
.  They occurred throughout the 
whole study region, with predominance of 
Golfingia margaritacea.  Both the abundance and 
the general features of distribution of Sipunculida 
did not change since 1977 (Fig. 1g). 
 
Cirripedia had several local but wide 
concentrations, so their abundance had sharp 
fluctuations from 0.004 to 4180.0 g m
-2
.  In 2002, 
the location of highest concentrations increased in 
the northern part of the region and formed three 
new spots.  The highest concentration was in the 
southernmost of these (Fig. 1h).

Sponges also widened their distribution in 2002. 
Recently they had four areas of high abundance.  
Two northern ones did not change position since 
1977, but maximal biomass of sponges here was in 
five times higher than in 1977.  Two southern ones 
were not observed in 1977. 
The total stock of macrobenthos over the studied 
region (38,700 km
2
) was estimated using the 
Voronoy method of diagrams (Preparata and 
Sheymos 1989) as 14.8 million t.  The stock of sea 
urchins was 3.9 million t, bivalves – 1.8 million t, 
and polychaetas – 1.5 million t.

Fig. 2 Communities of macrobenthos. 
 
 
Within the surveyed depth range of the East 
Sakhalin shelf, 13 communities of macrobenthos 
were distinguished by the Vorob’ev (1949) 
method.  Seven of them occupied the major part of 
the region bottom.  These seven communities were 
common for both surveys (Fig. 2). 
 
The community of flat sea urchin Echinarachnius 
parma occupied the largest area and had the 
highest mean biomass.  Average biomass of the 
community was 460.1 g/m
2
, the major species had 
82%.  It was placed on fine silted sand at the depth 
20-150 m.  This community was one of the most 
important in 1977, too, when it occupied the same 
place and depth.  However, the flat sea urchin

domination was higher in 1977.  Minor taxa in 
1977 were Bivalva, Bryozoa and Decapoda.  In 
2002, Cumacea and Gastropoda appeared in this 
community instead of Bryozoa and Decapoda, 
moreover, the share of Bivalva increased because 
of higher abundance of S. groenlandicus (Fig. 3). 
 
The other large benthic community, Golfingia 
margaritacea, was located as in 1977, at 81-232 m 
depth on mixed soils with a significant silt 
fraction.  The average biomass was 241.0 g m
-2
, 
with the major species accounting for 31%.  This 
community occupied less area in 1977.  Species 
composition of the community had slight changes 
till 2002 (Fig. 4).  The share of Holothuria and 
Polychaeta increased, the share of Amphipoda 
decreased, and Decapoda appeared;  other groups 
did not change their proportion.

Besides the large communities, several local 
communities with a predominance of one or two 
species occurred.  Diastylis bidentata dominated 
(92% of biomass) in one and was found at 30 m 
depth on a substrate of small shells, at the same 
place as in 1977 (Fig. 2).  Average biomass of the 
community was 266.7 g m

this community is shown in Figure 5.

By comparing the recent results with the data of 
1977, the following conclusions were made: 
1. mean total abundance of macrobenthos and its 
general distribution on the East Sakhalin shelf 
is largely unchanged from 1977;  
2. taxonomic composition of the macrobenthos 
in 2002 was the same as in 1977;  
3. mean abundance of the main taxonomic 
groups of macrobenthos almost had no change 
since 1977, except for Cirripedia (5 times 
greater), Spongia (5 times greater), 
Ophiuraidea (slight decrease), and sea urchins 
(slight decrease);  
4. two communities, dominate by E. parma and 
G. margaritacea, respectively, were the 
largest both in 1977 and 2002;  
5. both in 1977 and 2002, the vast area north of 
53°30’N was occupied by epifauna of 
Spongia, Hydroidea, Bryozoa, Cirripedia, 
Alcyonaria; and the central part of the studied 
region was occupied by communities of 
Cumacea and Amphipoda with stable 
quantitative parameters;  
6. four new communities of macrobenthos were 
found in 2002, the most important of them was 
the community dominated by Serripes 
groenlandicus;  
7. some widening of the Golfingia margaritacea 
community was noted because of silting of the 
bottom in the studied region.  
 
So far as species diversity, abundance and 
concentration of the main taxonomic groups of 
macrobenthos are still high enough at the East 
Sakhalin shelf, the recent state of bottom biota in 
this region is estimated as quite satisfactory, in 
spite of industrial pressure.  Some changes of 
biomass and ratio of certain macrobenthos groups 
are possibly reasoned by interannual fluctuations 
of their abundance, distribution, and aggregation 
determined by peculiarities of their biology.

The modern Sea of Okhotsk and the high-latitude 
glacial ocean share similar radiolarian faunas 
suggesting they also share environmental 
similarities.  This sea favors deep- (>200 m) over 
shallow-living species as evidenced by collections 
of sediment traps set at 258 m and 1061 m in the 
central part of the Sea.  Of the twelve dominant 
polycystine radiolarian species, four live above 
and eight below 258 m.  The shallow-living 
species’ productivity maxima coincide with spring 
and fall phytoplankton blooms while deep-living 
species’ annual production, nearly twice that of the 
shallow-living species, is concentrated in fall.  
Summer plankton tows collected higher 
concentrations of polycystine Radiolaria below 
than above 200 m with maximum concentration 
found between 200 and 500 m (Nimmergut and 
Abelmann, 2002).  Okhotsk Sea’s zooplankton and 
fish also have unusual summer biomass maxima 
between 200 m and 500 m (Gorbatenko 1996).  
The paucity of Radiolaria and other consumers 
above 200 m coincides with an upper (0-150 m) 
cold (-1.5° – 1.5°C), low salinity layer while 
higher concentrations below 200m occur within 
warmer saltier water.  This unusual biological 
structure must produce a lower ratio of shallow 
(<200 m) to deep carbon consumption than 
elsewhere in the world ocean. 
 
Deep-living radiolarian species, similar to those of 
the modern Sea of Okhotsk, dominate glacial high-
latitude deep-sea sediments.  If the water and 
biological structures that produced these glacial 
faunas were like those of the modern Sea of 
Okhotsk then glacial high-latitude oceans would 
have differed from today’s in at least two respects.  
Surface waters were less saline and more stable 
enhancing the spread of winter sea ice.  This 
stability, combined with a deepening of nutrient 
regeneration, reduced surface water nutrients 
contributing to a reduction of atmospheric carbon 
dioxide.

Microsporidian infestation of the walleye pollock musculature in the Okhotsk 
Sea

Glugea punctifera is the only species of 
Microsporidia parasites of the walleye pollock.  
As with some larvae of helminth worms, the 
microsporidia could obstruct food utilization of 
the fish by infection of its muscles.  According 
to previous investigations, the degree of 
infestation of pollock in the Okhotsk Sea by 
microsporidia is medium compared with other 
Far-Eastern seas (Asseyeva and Mikhailov 1991; 
Mikhailov 2002, and others). 
 
This study was conducted with the aim of 
revealing a link between walleye pollock 
abundance and the degree of infestation by 
spores of microsporidia.  For this purpose, 2679 
pollock specimens caught in the Okhotsk Sea in 
1993, 1995, and 2002-2003, were investigated, 
taking into account some previous data too.  
 
About 5% of the Okhotsk Sea pollock were 
infected in 1970-1980, and this level was stable 
without visible dependence on the stock 
fluctuations (Aseeva and Mikhailov 1991).  All 
infected fish had a length > 40 cm.  The incidence of 
infestation started to grow in late 1980s – early 
1990s and, by 1993, had reached the level of 8.65%.  
Then it decreased by 2.5 times to 3.74% in 1995.  In 
the winter of 2002-2003, only 3 of 132 specimens 
investigated in fresh state had microsporidian cysts 
in their muscles, and the cysts were absolutely 
absent from 202 frozen specimens.  Thus, the 
microsporidian infestation decreased in the second 
half of the 1990s, the same as for some other 
parasites of walleye pollock (Mikhailov, 2002).  
 
The declining incidence is in accord with a change 
of age-size structure of walleye pollock in the 
northern Okhotsk Sea.  In the 1990s, the stock was 
composed mainly of several strong generations born 
in late 1980s, but the mature part of the stock 
decreased steadily after 1994-1995 (Shuntov et al. 
1993; Avdeev et al. 2001).  As the microsporidian 
cysts form in muscles of mature fish only (length > 
40 cm), a reduction of the proportion of mature fish 
led to the decreasing incidence of microsporidias 
parasites.

Feeding of juvenile Pleurogrammus azonus in the southern part of the Sea of 
Okhotsk and in the Pacific waters of the Kuril Islands in August, 2002

The material on feeding was collected in the 
southern part of the Sea of Okhotsk  (45 - 50°N, 
142 - 151°E) and in the Pacific waters of the 
Kuril Islands  (40 - 47°N, 146 - 154°E) in 
August, 2002.  In total, the contents of 275 
stomachs were analyzed.  
 
Adult Pleurogrammus azonus are predators with 
mixed type of feeding (Mikulich, 1965).  
Juveniles are considered to be plankton feeding 
fishes, as they feed mainly plankton: 
Euphausiidae, Copepoda, Amphipoda 
(Kuznetsova 1997). 
 
The dominant food items for juvenile 
Pleurogrammus azonus in the Pacific waters of 
the Kuril Islands (only daytime trawls) were 
Neocalanus cristatus and N. plumchrus, which 
were present at the alimentary lump equally.  In 
this region, these copepods amounted to 18 and 
19%, respectively, from all plankton biomass. 
Index of stomach fullness was 70.4 0/000.  
 
In the Sea of Okhotsk, the intensity of feeding 
was higher.  In the Bay of Terpenia, the index of 
stomach fullness was 97.3 0/000.  At night, the 
composition of food was only Thysanoessa longipes, 
whereas in daytime only N. plumchrus were 
consumed, the share of which in plankton was 26%.  
In Okhotsk Sea waters, the index of stomach fullness 
was 134.2 0/000.  In the dark hours, Pleurogrammus 
azonus consumed only Th. longipes, while it was N. 
plumchrus during the day.  Themisto japonica was 
found only in very small amounts.  Pleurogrammus 
azonus from transformed Pacific waters had a high 
index of stomach fullness (139.7 0/000).  At night, 
the fishes consumed Th. longipes, while during 
daytime, it consumed N. plumchrus.  
 
The entire ration was not distinguished by 
particularly great variation as it consisted of 4-5 
species only.  Food composition changed during the 
day as Th. longipes migrates away from the surface 
at night; in its absence, the fish consumed large 
numbers of Copepoda.  
 
Researched juvenile of Pleurogrammus azonus had 
two peaks of feeding activity, morning and evening, 
as was reported earlier (Chuchukalo et al. 1995; 
Kuznetsova 1997).

Disorder of symmetry in the marine starfishes of Amursky Bay

The presence of symmetry is inherent in various 
species of animals from Protozoa to Entozoans. 
Two types of symmetry – bilateral and radial are 
assumed.  Radial symmetry is featured in 
coelenterates, radiolarians, echinodermata, 
sponges, ascidia and some others.  Bilateral 
symmetry seems to be more prospective in term 
of evolution.  The animals having it evolved 
towards segmentation of the body, 
differentiation of segments, formation of active 
pedes with different functions.  Animals 
possessing radial symmetry are less intricate in 
their structure and have a slow moving or 
sedentary way of life.  
 
Bilateral symmetry is the phenomenon when the 
formation of a feature on one side of the body is 
associated with presence of such a feature on the 
other side.  This phenomenon lies at the base of 
morphological and physiological processes of an 
organism.  It concerns external and internal 
structure. 
 
At the same time, some organs can be arranged 
asymmetrically (one-sided location of the heart, 
gall bladder, and spleen of mammals, etc.).  
Fundamentals of the asymmetry phenomenon in 
animals can rise from different processes that 
affect differently their nature.  N.V. Timofeev-
Resovsky and V.I. Ivanov (1966) identified a 
few types of disorder in symmetry and offered a 
classification.  Among animals, there are various 
possible various types of symmetry disorder.  
Some types are caused by inheritance-induced 
adaptive changes (for example, left and right 
hemisphere functions of the human cerebrum).  
Such type exposure in different groups of 
animals seems to be absolutely distinct.  
 
We explored disorder of symmetry in animals 
with radial symmetry that were not considered in 
the classification of N. V. Timofeev-Resovsky 
and V. I. Ivanov. 
The marine starfishes possess five-armed radial 
symmetry but some diversions were depicted. 
Specimens with four to seven arms are described in 
the big Indian star Oreaster reticulates that normally 
has five arms.  We explored the frequency of 
occurrence of anomalous marine starfishes of two 
species from Amursky Bay (regarding number of 
arms).  Samples of Asterias amurensis taken in 
shallow waters near Skrebtsova Island from 0.5-2.5 
m depth in 1992 consisted of more than 10,000 
specimens and samples of Patiria pectinifera 
included more than 5,000 specimens.  The frequency 
of occurrence of anomalous starfishes was 
determined according to the number of arms.   
 
Among 11,520 specimens of Asterias amurensis, 
there were found 0.017% (2 specimens) with four 
arms, 0.113% (13 specimens) with six arms, 0.043% 
(5 specimens) with seven arms, and 0.009% (1 
specimen) with three arms (Table 1).  In the case of 
a decrease in number of arms we counted only such 
animals that had no signs of secondary loss.  
Variation of arms number was observed in Patiria 
pectinifera also.  This normally five-armed starfish 
can have from four to seven arms.  Specifically, it 
was noted that diversion from five-armed specimens 
was often observed as an increase in the number of 
arms.  Most often the 6-armed starfishes were 
encountered.  The 4-armed specimens, as with 
Asterias amurensis, were rarely encountered. 
 
It is necessary to consider the biological significance 
of five-armed symmetry of starsfishes.  This is 
preserved by hereditary, and as a consequence, has 
some adaptive value.  While attacking bivalve 
mollusks, starsfishes stand on three of the arms 
while the other two discloses the shell. 3-, 4-, 6-, 7-
armed starfishes are less adaptive therefore they are 
subjected to selection. 
 
It was noticed that the incidence of asymmetry in 
number of starfish arms is significantly lower than 
the FA (fluctuating asymmetry) that occurs in 
 178
Pacific salmon (see Mitrofanov and Dogadova, 
this volume).  At the same time, damage during 
ontogenesis has some common features with FA.  
The asymmetry of starfishes is observed as 
either a decrease of the feature or an increase of 
it.  Increases occurred more often.  Probably, the 
high frequency of anomalous starfishes in Amursky 
Bay was associated with higher levels of 
contamination by heavy metals and various toxic 
substances of production and domestic origin that 
were unique to this bay.

Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis is very 
important target of the groundfish fishery in the 
North Pacific Ocean.  The feeding habits of 
Pacific halibut in the western Bering Sea were 
investigated long ago (Vernidub 1936; Gordeeva 
1954; Novikov 1964, 1974).  There are several 
publications dealt with feeding habits of species 
considered in the Kuril-Kamchatka area (Novikov 
1974; Orlov 1997a,b, 1998, 1999a,b, 2000; 
Moukhametov 2002).  However, diet descriptions 
in most of these papers were based only on 
frequency of occurrence of dietary components in 
stomachs. 
 
The stomach contents of Pacific halibut sampled 
aboard the Japanese trawlers Kayo Maru No. 28 
and Tomi Maru No. 82 during summer-autumn 
1997 were analysed.  The study took place in the 
western Bering Sea (WBS) between 168°E and 
178°W (Fig. 1A), in the Pacific waters off the 
northern Kuril Islands and southeastern 
Kamchatka (NK) between 48°10’N and 51°30’N 
(Fig. 1B).  Samples for analysis were taken from 
bottom trawl catches.  Fishing was carried out 
around the clock.  The stomach contents were 
sorted, identified to the lowest possible taxonomic 
level, and weighed.  Prey groups were described in 
terms of percent total stomach content weight.  
Fishes showing signs of regurgitation or net-
feeding were excluded from analysis. 
 
Stomachs “examined/with food” were as follows: 
262/206 in the WBS and 386/270 in the NK.  
Total number of organisms identified (excluding 
fishery offal) in stomachs was no less than 25 in 
the WBS and 32 in the NK.  The diet of Pacific 
halibut in the WBS consisted mostly of fishes 
(35.12%), fishery offal (31.3%) and cephalopods 
(26.6%) (Fig. 2A).  Walleye pollock Theragra 
chalcogramma was the major fish species 
consumed (18.7%) followed by Pacific herring 
Clupea pallasii (12.9%).  Red squid Berryteuthis 
magister (13.6%) and octopuses (13.0%) were 
most important cephalopods.  In the NK, Pacific 
halibut fed mainly on fishes (38.9%) and 
cephalopods (36.8%).  The role of fishery offal in 
the diet of halibut here was significantly lesser 
than in the previous area (9.3%) (Fig. 2B).

Fig. 2 Diet of Pacific halibut in the western 
Bering Sea (above) and northern 
Kuriles/southeastern Kamchatka (below). 
 
Similar to WBS, walleye pollock (21.8%) was 
most important fish prey though among 
cephalopods, octopuses were most important 
(23.5%).  Differences in diet composition between 
areas considered may be explained by regional 
faunistic distinctions, different levels of fishery 
activity in both areas, and distinctions of halibut 
size (mean fork length 73.9 cm vs. 61.4 cm in 
WBS and NK, respectively). 
 
Changes in diet composition of Pacific halibut 
with increasing size were observed during 
previous studies and were detected during our 
investigations as well.  In the WBS, increasing 
size of Pacific halibut was accompanied by 
increased fish consumption and decreased feeding 
on fishery offal.  The fraction of cephalopods in 
the diet was approximately equal for various 
length classes (Fig. 3A).  With increasing predator 
length, consumption rate of red squid decreased, 
and that of octopuses increased.  In the NK area 
small size groups of Pacific halibuts (35-45 cm) 
ate mostly hermit crabs, spider crabs, shrimps and 
fish.  Small crustaceans and fishery offal played 
some role in the diet of this size group.  The 
proportion of hermit crabs in the halibut diet 
decreased with increasing of predator length.  
Spider crabs have significant importance in diet of 
all analysed length categories.  The role of fish in 
the diet of Pacific halibut gradually increased with 
increasing of predator length.  The proportion of 
cephalopods and fishery offal increased 
significantly when halibut attained 80 cm length.  
Subsequently, with increasing of predator length 
importance of cephalopods in diet slightly 
decreased (Fig. 3B).  Octopuses and red squid 
have approximately equal importance in diet of 
NK Pacific halibut sized 45 to 85 cm.  Larger fish 
eat mostly octopuses. 
 
Considerable differences in diet compositions 
were detected at various depths.  Stomach contents 
of WBS Pacific halibut at the shallower depths 
consisted mostly of fishery offal and fish (mainly 
of walleye pollock).  With depth increasing role of 
fishery offal decreased from 63.8% within 251-
300 m to 17.5% in 401-450 m depth range while 
that of cephalopods contrarily increased from 
9.1% to 47.5% respectively.  Share of fish in 
halibut diet increased from 23.5% at 251-300 m to 
56.8% at 351-400 m and deeper (451-500 m) it 
was reduced to 9.4%.  In the NK depths increasing 
was accompanied with decreasing of fish 
importance in diet and, contrarily, increasing of 
consumption of cephalopods.  Fishery offal 
constituted 9.5-11.1% of stomach contents within 
151-300 m depth range, and hermit crabs played 
noticeable role (3.7-13.6%) in halibut diet at all 
investigated depths.  Some differences between 
male and female diets were detected (Fig. 4).  
Thus, female Pacific halibut in the WBS ate more 
fishery offal (36.9%), fish (31.2%) and 
cephalopods (27.1%).  In this region male fed 
mostly on fish (38.0%), fishery offal (27.2%) and 
cephalopods (26.2%W).  Males used a wider 
spectrum of fish prey.  The male list included no 
less than nine fish species while female stomachs 
contained remains only of four species.  Anyway, 
the most important prey in halibut diets among 
fishes were walleye pollock (18.2% and 19.5% for 
males and females, respectively), and Pacific 
herring (15.2% and 9.8%, for males and females, 
respectively).  Differences in consumption of red 
squid and octopuses by males and females were 
observed.  Thus, male diet contained 16.1% red

preferred octopuses (16.8%) and ate red squid in 
significantly lesser amount (10.2%). 
 
In the NK area Pacific halibut females consumed 
more cephalopods (42.5%), fish (31.2%) and 
fishery offal (10.8%) while males ate fish in 
considerably larger amount (45.1%) and 
cephalopods were second important dietary 
component of male halibuts (33.3%).  Similar to 
the WBS region, the spectrum of fish prey of male 
halibuts was broader, but walleye pollock 
remained most important prey item of both sexes.  
There were no significant differences in 
consumption of red squid and octopuses by male 
and female, as in the WBS.

Differences of male and female diet compositions 
may be related partly to distinctions in their sizes.  
In the WBS, the mean length of males was 72.5 
cm vs. 75.9 cm for females.  In the NK, mean 
length of Pacific halibut was 59.9 cm vs. 62.3 cm 
for males and females, respectively.  Another 
reason for the diet differences between males and 
females is one of mechanisms to decrease intra-
specific feeding competition in the areas with 
limited forage resources such as continental 
slopes. 
 
Regional differences were observed in the diets of 
halibut within WBS and NK areas.  Thus, fishes 
(43.9%) and cephalopods (42.9%) were more 
important in the diet of Pacific halibut caught in 
the western part of WBS while fishery offal 
(67.9%) and fishes (23.5%) were the most 
significant dietary components in the eastern part, 
where the share of cephalopods was only 5.3%.  
Orlov and Moukhametov (2002) observed the 
same situation in respect of Pacific black halibut 
Reinhardtius hippoglossoides matsuurae and 
Kamchatka flounder Atheresthes evermanni in this 
region.  Sufficient differences in halibut 
consumption of crabs were observed in the 
western (8.2%) and in the eastern (1.4%) parts of 
WBS.  
 
The diet of Pacific halibut in the NK area changed 
from south to north, with the importance of fish 
increasing in this direction and that of cephalopods 
decreasing.  Thus, in the south part of the study 
area, the share of fishes was 12.6% and they were 
third in rank after cephalopods (46.2%) and 
fishery offal (19.1%).  In the middle part, fishes 
were second in rank (37.2%) and in the north their 
role reached 41.0% and they became most 
important dietary component of Pacific halibut.  
Opposite, importance of cephalopods decreased to 
35.9% in the north.  Differences in diet 
compositions between various parts of NK area 
were considerable in respect of consumption of 
hermit crabs and fishery offal as well.  These 
differences may be explained by significant 
distinctions of predator sizes (52.7 vs. 54.9 vs. 
65.2 cm in the southern, middle and northern 
parts, respectively) and also by local faunistic 
distinctions.  Domination of fishery offal in halibut 
diets in the eastern part of the WBS is probably 
related to active specialized walleye pollock 
fishery in this area by numerous fishing vessels.

Distribution of foraminifera in the Sea of Okhotsk

Despite the available publications concerning the 
distribution of bottom foraminifera, these data are 
very difficult to use for the paleoecological 
purposes.  They are overloaded with detailed 
elaboration of the selected communities and often 
are studied without taking into account living 
foraminifers.  Offer model are put in a basis of 
data basically on live foraminifers, and also 
behavior of separate kinds in the past. 
 
We selected the following communities:  (1) shelf 
with four subtypes, (2) underwater slope with two 
subtypes and (3) abyssal.  The most indicative 
forms are presented in Table 1.  Symbols of 
subtypes are:  1 А-estuary-lagoon;  1 В-inner shelf 
(0-20 m);  1 С-middle shelf (20-50 m);  1D-outer 
shelf (50-200 m);  2A-top slope (200-600 m);  2B-
low slope (600-1300 m) and 3-abyssal (more than 
1300 m). 
 
The foraminiferan fauna of the Okhotsk Sea 
differs essentially from that of the Pacific at the 
same latitudes.  There are no typical deepwater 
species (genera Plectina, Cyclammina, 
Bathysiphon), but paleontological findings testify 
that such abyssal fauna lived in the Okhotsk Sea 
three times during the last of 40 million years.

In 2001-2002 in Aniva Bay, Sea of Okhotsk, 
complex research on the seasonal variability of 
nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations was 
conducted to determine lower trophic kevel 
productivity.  The research was carried out in 
different seasons:  in April, June, August, October, 
November, January 2001 and 2002 respectively.  
The purpose was to compare analysis of data 
collected in in 2001 and 2002. 
 
Aniva Bay belongs to the La Perouse (Soya) Strait 
area.  That area is under the influence of the West 
Sakhalin Current (Sea of Japan) and partly by the 
East Sakhalin Current (Sea of Okhotsk).  The 
maximum depth in the bay reaches to 100 m.  The 
hydrochemical research was conducted on four 
latitudinal sections or 14 stations (Fig. 1). 
 
 
Fig. 1 Scheme of stations.  Aniva Bay. 2001-2002. 
 
The water was selected with the help Rossette, 
supplied by the cartridge from 12 plastic Niskin 
1.7 liter bottles on given depth 10, 20, 30, 50, 75 
and 90 meters.  
Research cruises in Aniva Bay during 2001-2002 
have allowed a characterization of the 
hydrochemical parameters of water features and to 
determine seasonal peculiarities of their 
distribution in two different years. 
 
In April 2001, immediately after ice sampling was 
carried out, the distribution of chlorophyll-“a” and 
nutrients are shown.  The phytoplankton bloom 
develops at the ice edge and at shoals.  Active 
upwelling, enriched by nutrients was marked, 
favoring the creation of an intensive peak in 
primary production.  The chlorophyll a 
concentration reached 20 mg l
-1
 (Fig. 2).  In 
addition, there was an expressed influence of 
water masses from Sea of Japan and Sea of 
Okhotsk.  
 
In June 2001, nutrients were distributed vertically 
homogenously.  The seasonal loss of chlorophyll a 
was determinated up to 4.87 mg l
-1
.  In August 
2001, water temperatures varied from –1.230 to 
plus 20.470°C.  Thus a well-expressed 
intermediate cold layer at a depth 10-15 m was 
evident, creating very strong stratification (Fig. 3).  
The stratification prevented the penetration of 
nutrients from depth and in the upper layer, 
nutrients were depleted.  Chlorophyll a in the 
upper layer was absent and phytoplankton remains 
(maximum 1.65 mg l
-1
) were founded at depths 
with an oxygen maximum (132% saturation) (Fig. 
4) in an interval of average temperatures from 
7.380°C up to 10.790°C (Fig. 5).  
 
In October 2001 after storms, the layers of water 
become similar on structure, and the concentration 
ammonia (20 µM) increased.  The distribution 
chlorophyll a becomes spotty and concentrations 
in thicker waters grew up to 3.74 mg l
-1
.

By November, concentrations of inorganic forms 
of nitrogen, phosphorus and silica had increased. 
Chlorophyll a was obtained from the upper layer, 
up to the depth 50 m.  Despite low chlorophyll a 
concentration (0.22 – 2.85 mg l
-1
) this 
phenomenon can possibly be described as a 
second, fall peak in phytoplankton presence.  
 
In January 2002, the nutrient stock had increased.  
Chlorophyll a was absent in all layers, silica 
contents were 27.7 µM.  Chlorophyll a and silica 
have an opposite dependence, because diatoms, 
which use the silica to construct their frustules, are 
the dominant taxa in the phytoplankton 
community in spring.  Oxygen saturation varied 
from 69 up to 92%.  As we expected, a direct 
connection between chlorophyll a and dissolved 
oxygen exists. 
 
The spring of 2002 arrived early, so in April the 
ice had already left and the beginning of the 
vegetative period was not apparent.  Nutrients 
were rather high: phosphorus up to 3 µM, silica up 
to 33.5 µM (Figs. 6, 7) and chlorophyll a 
concentration reached 2.72 mg 
-1
, growing by June 
up to 7.96 mg l
-1
.  Thus, production processes in 
spring of 2002 proceeded more slowly in 
comparison with a similar period in 2001, not 
creating an appreciable large burst of 
phytoplankton.  
The rainy weather conditions of the cool summer 
of 2002 supplied large inflows of freshwater with 
terrestial sediments in the upper layer of Aniva 
Bay.  By August of 2002, compared with the same 
period in 2001, the cold intermediate layer formed 
deeper, up to 30-40 m (Fig. 8), complicating the 
inflow of nutrients from depth.  Oxygen saturation 
varied from 65 up to 105% (Fig. 9), and maximum 
chlorophyll a concentration peaked at 1.98 mg/l
-1
.  
 
The autumn of 2002 was characterized by low 
nutrient concentrations in the photic layer. 
Saturated oxygen reached 62%, only because of 
storms and active sedimentation in Aniva Bay. 
 
Concerning internal comparison of 2001 and 2002, 
it is necessary to note the sharp distinction in 
hydrochemical conditions of Aniva Bay.  Climatic 
peculiarities of an early, cold spring in 2002, 
heavy rains in the summer prevented active 
phytoplankton blooming, so the low chlorophyll a 
concentration was obtained.  The cold 
intermediate layer in August 2001 was formed at a 
depth of about 15 m, but in August 2002, at a 
depth of about 30 m.  That had a strong influence 
on the hydrochemical parameters of water masses 
inside Aniva Bay.

The modern malacofauna in the coastal areas of 
Sakhalin have been rather well investigated.  
However, over the last thousand years or so, large 
changes in taxonomic composition have occurred.  
These are closely connected to changes of climate 
and environmental conditions.  To track such 
changes it is possible only on the basis of 
biogeographical analysis of mollusks from various 
archaeological collections in view of radiocarbon 
dates of shells.   
 
A total of 60 species of mollusks, including 
fisheries species were collected from more than 
hundred archaeological sites (middens) around 
Sakhalin Island:  These included 1 - Loricata, 35 – 
Gastropoda, and 33 - Bivalvia (Tables 1 and 2).  
The age of mollusks corresponds to the period 
from the early Neolithic (5-6 thousand years ago) 
up to the 1800-1900s.  Biogeographical analysis 
allows tracking changes in structure of the 
malacofauna and a climate, hydrology for the last 
thousand years or so at coast of Sakhalin. 
 
The periods of existence of the archaeological 
collections were determined by radiocarbon dating 
of the mollusk shells collected.  The Neolithic 
culture developed on Sakhalin since 5-6,000 years 
ago and ended 2-2,500 years ago.  The Susuja 
culture existed in the southern half of the island 
from 2,5-1,500 years ago.  During the first few 
centuries of the current era, 100-500, the North-
Sakhalin culture was distributed mostly in the in 
northern part of Sakhalin.  In the southern part of 
Sakhalin, from 500-700, there was a Tovada 
culture.  The greatest distribution in the south of 
Sakhalin, and also on the north of Hokkaido and 
Kuriles during the period from 700 to 1300 was 
the Okhotskaja culture.  From 900-1300, in the 
south of the island, the Minami-Kaizuku culture 
developed, and from 1200-1400, the Pokrovskaja 
culture.  At last, from 1300 to the 20
th
 century, the 
Northern Sakhalin culture developed, and in the 
south, the Ajnu cultures, the Neizi and Nivh. 
 
At the Neolithic site of Aleksandrovsk, the 
subtropical species Crassostrea gigas and 
Anadara sp. are found as part the Northern 
Sakhalin culture.  They testify to climate warming, 
corresponding period of a climatic optimum in the 
Holocene.  At this time, the subtropical species of 
mollusks penetrated through Tsugaru Strait to the 
western coast Hokkaido, and then into the northern 
part of Tatar Strait where shallow lagoons existed.  
During the Atlantic period (8,000-4,500 years 
ago), subtropical species of mollusks existed along 
the entire coast of Sakhalin.  However, about 
4,500 years ago they disappeared from this area in 
connection with the cold Subboreal period (4,500-
2,200 years ago).  Therefore during the 
subAtlantic period (2,200 years ago to present), 
the Pacific oyster (C. gigas) existed only in the 
southern part of Sakhalin (Aniva Bay) where 
numerous sites (Susuja-1, Solovjevka-1, etc.) 
occured in the Susuja culture. On the western 
coast of Sakhalin, only subboreal species of 
mollusks (Spisula sachalinensis, Neptunea 
arthritica, Buccinum sakhalinensis, etc.) occurred 
at this time.  In the Northern Sakhalin culture, 
about 2,000-1,500 years ago, objects of a craft 
served also Corbicula japonica, Mya arenaria and 
Crypthochiton stelleri, etc.  From sites on rivers 
located on the coast (Ado-Timovo, Cape Bauri), 
fresh-water mollusks Dahurinaia laevis and 
Kunashiria sp. were extracted. 
 
With the formation of La Perouse Strait during the 
Early Holocene, many gastropods of the genera 
Neptunea and Buccinum penetrated from Sea of 
Okhotsk to Japan.  Some species of mollusks from 
these sorts were distributed far to the south, to the 
the Korean Peninsula (Neptunea arthritica).

The early Middle Ages (700-1100) was a warm 
period along the coast of Sakhalin.  Therefore, 
during this time, many collections from the early 
Okhotskaja cultures had shell middens containing 
C.gigas.  This abundant species also occurred 
along the coast of Aniva Bay and Patience Bay 
where there were sea lagoons.  Finds of tropical 
mollusks Meretrix lusoria (Kalinino-1) and 
Rapana sp. (Gardeners - 1) testify to warmer 
climates in southern Sakhalin.  The average annual 
temperature of water at this time was 
approximately on 3 - 5° С greater than at present.  
Except for oysters extracted S. sachalinensis, 
Mizuhopecten yessoensis, Crenomytilus grayanus, 
N.arthritica, Acmaea pallida, etc.  From coast of 
Sea of Okhotsk delivered to settlements and other 
species Gastropoda, and also some Boreal-Arctic 
species (Tridonta borealis borealis). 
 
From 1000-1300, the sharp decrease in the number 
of extracted species of mollusks, connected with 
the beginning of a cold period in the 1200s, is 
marked.  At this time, not only did the tropical 
species disappear from the malacofauna, but the 
subtropical ones too.  For example, C. gigas 
disappeared from Patience Bay and its shells 
became rare on the western coast.  Only with 
occurrence of the Ainu cultures in the 1300s, Neizi 
in the south and Nivh in the north, did the quantity 
of extracted species of mollusks increase.  The 
basic objects were S. sachalinensis, M. yessoensis, 
C. japonica, Mercenaria stimpsoni.  The Nivhy 
culture also had fisheries for pearl-oyster D. laevis 
(Grotto Puzi), and the Ainu for gastropods of the 
genera Neptunea and Buccinum.  However 
because of a cold period from 1600-1900, the 
number of mollusks fauna was rather small. 
 
Thus, the structure and number of extracted 
mollusks along the coast of Sakhalin are closely 
connected to changes in climate during the last 
several thousand years.  During warm periods, the 
malacofauna appears to be more subtropical and 
even tropical, that coincides with an increase in 
the number of human settlements and to 
occurrence in shell middens of C.gigas and other 
species.  During cold periods, the number of 
species of mollusks decreases.  The basic species 
of mollusks of coastal areas of Sakhalin appeared 
in the Early Holocene on parts of the southern 
Kuriles and from Hokkaido.  The greatest 
similarity among malacofauna collections on 
Sakhalin is with malacofauna coastal areas of 
northern Hokkaido.

The method of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of 
the seawater was used to calibrate satellite 
measurements of chlorophyll a concentrations in 
coastal water of the Sea of Okhotsk during 
scientific cruises in 2000-2002.  Measurements 
were made by pumping laser fluorometer installed 
on the sailboard.  The second harmonic of the 
Nd:YAG laser was used to induce the fluorescence 
spectra.  The scanning monochromator measures 
the fluorescence intensity from 540 nm to 740 nm 
during 1.5 minute.  Measurements were done from 
a moving ship;  the spatial resolution of 
chlorophyll a concentration determination was 
about 200 meters.  The shipboard measurements 
were compared with chlorophyll a concentrations 
received by SeaWiFS scanner (level 1a data) at the 
same time and area by using the global positioning 
system.  The features of the fluorescence spectra 
were used to determine the seawater areas where 
the satellite and fluorometer data were very close. 
Satellite chlorophyll a concentrations, calculated 
by the OC-2 algorithm, describe the large-scale 
changes correctly in general, though absolute 
values retrieved from the satellite may be more 
than two times as large.  It is possible to get large 
volume of necessary measurements for 
comparative analysis and correction of satellite 
data with the help of LIF.  It is possible to develop 
regional ocean color chlorophyll a algorithms for 
SeaWiFS using the LIF method.

The distribution of phytoplankton in the coastal 
waters of Sakhalin Island was studied from June-
August 2001.  Samples were collected using a 1-
liter bathometer from the surface layer.  The 
material was fixed with Utermel’s solution and 
concentrated by sedimentation.  Cell number was 
counted in 1 and 0.05 ml Nojott’s chambers.  Wet 
algal biomass was estimated by the volumetric 
method.  Species with a density no less than 20% 
of the total phytoplankton density were considered 
to be dominant. 
 
We found 147 species and intraspecific taxa of 
microalgae belonging to 7 taxonomic divisions: 
dinoflagellates (68 species), diatoms (64), 
euglenophytes (5), chrysophytes (4), cryptophytes 
(3), chlorophytes (2) and cyanophytes (1).  Among 
the diatoms, the most diversified genera were 
Chaetoceros (13 species) and Thalassiosira (7); 
among dinoflagellates Protoperidinium (17). 
 
During the observation period, the phytoplankton 
density in the coastal waters of Sakhalin Island 
varied from 0.03 × 10
3
 to 742.1 × 10
3
 cells l
-1
;  and 
its biomass from 0.69 to 2407.7 mg m
-3
.  The 
distribution of phytoplankton density in the coastal 
waters of Sakhalin Island was not uniform (Table 
1). 
 
High average values of phytoplankton density and 
biomass were found for Aniva Bay.  The 
maximum outbreak of phytoplankton density was 
recorded in the innermost part of the Bay.  The 
smallest values of phytoplankton densities were 
found for the seaward areas of the Bay (Fig. 1).  
The flagellate algae - cryptophytes and 
dinoflagellates constituted the bulk of the 
phytocenoce (at average 69% of the total 
phytoplankton density and 80% of the total 
biomass).  Small flagellates Plagioselmis 
prolonga, P. punctata, Cryptomonas acuta, 
Katodinium rotundata were dominant in terms of 
density, dinoflagellates  Alexandrium tamarense, 
Gyrodinium spirale, G. lachryma and diatoms 
Thalassiosira anguste-lineata, Thalassionema 
nitschioides were dominant in biomass.  This 
species composition is characteristic of the 
summer of phytoplankton.

Low densities of phytoplankton were found in 
southeastern coastal Sakhalin Island (Table 1).  
Some increases in numbers of microalgae cells 
occurred north of Cape Terpeniya. Diatoms 
dominated in the plankton.  Among the diatoms, 
Leptocylindrus mediterraneus, Pseudo-nitschia 
pungens, Skeletonema costatum make up the 
greater part of the phytoplankton density.  Large 
dinoflagellates Ceratium fusus and C. longipes 
dominated in terms of biomass.  
 
 
Fig. 1 Distribution of phytoplankton density 
and biomass in the coastal waters of Sakhalin 
Island in summer 2001 (black – diatoms, white – 
flagellates). 
Low densities of phytoplankton were found in the 
northeastern coastal waters of Sakhalin Island 
(Table 1).  Diatoms were the most abundant and 
constituted 51% of total density and 69% of total 
biomass of phytoplankton.  Guinardia delicatula, 
Chaetoceros sp. and small flagellates dominated. 
 
The distribution of phytoplankton in the 
northernmost area was highly irregular.  Diatoms 
were the most abundant and constituted 73% of 
total density and 88% of total biomass of 
phytoplankton.  Average values of density and 
biomass had relatively high development of 
phytoplankton in the open part of Sakhalin Bay.  
Small cells Thalassiosira, Skeletonema costatum 
and Ditylum brightwellii dominated.  The peak of 
biomass (2.4 g m
-3
) was caused by abundant 
development of Ditylum brightwellii in this area.  
Low quantitative characteristics were found at the 
other stations.  
 
Thus, the distribution of phytoplankton density 
and biomass along the coast of Sakhalin Island 
(Sea of Okhotsk) shows significant spatial 
heterogeneity.  This is connected with significant 
spatial and temporal extension of our study.  
Waters of the study area were classified as 
mesotrophic according Yamada et al. (1980), a 
classification based on phytoplankton density and 
dominant phytoplankton species.  Species 
composition and quantitative characteristics of 
phytoplankton of the study area are typical for the 
summer phytoplankton of the coastal waters of 
Sakhalin Island.

Metridia okhotensis is a large grazing copepod 
occurring in the Okhotsk Sea and is the most 
predominant component of zooplankton biomass 
of surface layer during the year.  It is known to be 
prey for various pelagic fishes, whales and sea 
birds (Nemoto 1963; Odate 1994; Hunt et al. 
1998) and is therefore a vital link between primary 
production and predators in these regions. 
 
Over the last few decades there have been reports 
of changes in the zooplankton biomass and age 
structure of M. okhotensis in the Okhotsk Sea. 
Maximal concentrations of this species were 
observed on the shelf of the northern part of the 
Okhotsk Sea (200-500 mg m
-3
) and the southern 
deep part of the Okhotsk Sea (200-1000 mg m
-3
) in 
spring, summer and autumn.  The biomass of M. 
okhotensis was uniformly distribution throughout 
the region, with a mean density of 50 mg m
-3
 in 
winter.  The seasonal pattern seen in the biomass 
of M. okhotensis is parallel to that of total 
copepods, so that M. okhotensis was an important 
determinant of the seasonal variation pattern of 
copepod biomass in Okhotsk Sea. 
 
All stages of copepodite are present in the 
population of M. okhotensis in spring and summer.  
They are predominantly individuals of copepodite 
stages CIV-VI (IV-47%, V-23%, VI-21%), with a 
small number CI-III stages (I-18%, II-15%, III -
23%). 
 
In autumn and winter, the population consisted 
mostly of individuals of copepodite stages CII-VI,  
CIII - 25%, CIV- 10.4%, CV 15%.  Among the 
copepodites, stage CVI was the most numerous at 
48%.  Younger copepodites, stages CI-II, of this 
species were completely absent from the plankton 
during these seasons. 
 
The present results from field survey suggest that 
M. okhotensis in the Okhotsk Sea has a one year 
life cycle.  The spawning season continues from 
late May to late August, with maximal intensity in 
July and a progression from south to north.  Early 
nauplii in late May-June developed to CIV-V by 
the beginning of August – September and the 
majority of CV had molted to adult stages in 
April-May. 
 
These results on the M. okhotensis population 
show that in winter this species was not 
multiplying in the Okhotsk Sea.  The onset of 
unfavorable conditions slows growth at 
developmental stages IV-V and the population 
enters a resting state.  This phase lasts until the 
onset of more favorable conditions for 
development, reproduction starts again in April-
May together with the warm waters.

Peculitiarities of ontogenetic and seasonal migrations of demersal commercial 
fish in the Okhotsk Sea and adjacent waters of the Northwest Pacific

Macrocirculation of the ocean plays an important 
role in dispersion of fish and in the formation of 
ichtyofauna.  Currents, systems of the currents, 
and eddys influence the distribution, reproduction, 
ontogenetic and seasonal migrations of many fish 
(Marti 1980; Moiseyev 1989; Kodolov, etc. 1991, 
etc.).  
 
The Okhotsk Sea is not a closed system.  Currents 
connect parts of areas of many species in the 
Okhotsk Sea with adjoining waters of northwest 
Pacific through the Kuril straits, in the same way 
as the Bering Sea is connected through the 
Aleutian straits (Fig. 1). 
 
Two of the most numerous and widely distributed 
of demersal fish groups live in the deep ocean only 
as adults (Kodolov, etc. 1991):  
1. Grenadiers and longfin codling have a pelagic 
or planktonic stage of development and drift 
passively as larvae with the currents, living a 
pelagic lifestyle in the open ocean as 
juveniles; 
2. Halibuts, sablefish, flounder, and rockfish 
have a littoral juvenile stage.  
The species considered below, have different 
distributions.  They are most interesting by the 
extent of their ontogenetic and seasonal migrations 
in the Okhotsk Sea and adjoining waters, and also 
the major role of these migrations in associations 
with systems of currents.  The purpose of this 
publication is to consider the biology, distribution, 
and life cycle compared with features of 
ontogenetic and seasonal migrations of these 
species to understand their differences and the 
general laws.

This publication is based on research conducted by 
TINRO on demersal fish of the northern Pacific 
from the beginning of the 1960s up to the end of 
1990s.  Data are from ichtyoplanktonic, trawling 
ground and pelagic surveys, and research fishing 
vessels.  The results of tagging, morphometric, 
genetic-biochemical and parasite analyses, 
publications and materials are used in this 
publication. 
 
The features of biology and distribution of 
demersal fish have been investigated rather 
insufficiently.  Data were collected irregularly in 
different years and seasons in different areas but it 
provides an opportunity to develop a hypothetical 
scheme of seasonal cycles.  
 
Giant grenadier (Albatrossia pectoralis)  
This species is distributed in the Okhotsk Sea and 
along the Kuril Islands everywhere from depths of 
400-600 m.  It is the most numerous species of 
benthic fish on the continental slope and prevails 
from 600-700 m (up to 70-90 % of the catch).  It is 
considered “the pollock of the depths” and with an 
increasing value in recent years, catches have been 
increasing.  
 
The life cycle scheme of the species was proposed 
(Tuponogov 1986,1991) based on own data and on 
literary data (Novikov 1970, 1974; Tuponogov 
1986, 1991, 1993, 1997; etc.).  Females make up 
80-90% of all in benthic layers at the continental 
slope.  A small fraction comes from the bottom at 
significant distances and meets in thickness of 
water on depths from 300-500 up to 1300-1500 m 
(Fig. 2).  
 
The distribution of giant grenadier in the Okhotsk 
Sea differs from other areas by the absence of 
significant aggregations.  Maximal densities occur 
at the southwestern part of Kamchatka, and the 
northern Kuril Islands under the influence of 
Okhotsk Sea waters through the northern Kuril 
straits.  More dense aggregations are formed on 
the Pacific side of the Kuriles near Kruzenstern’s 
and Bussol’ deep-water straits, at depths of 900-
1450 m.  Spawning of some individuals probably 
occurs constant within all year lengthways slope 
depths within the limits of deep water.  The most 
intensive aggregations are during spawning on the 
Pacific side off the Kuril Islands during the spring-
summer period at depths about 1200 m.  A fraction 
of the stock is not spawning within the year. 
 
Fish eggs of giant grenadier develop in depths 
more than 500-1000 m.  The majority of eggs, 
larvae and juveniles this species in the Okhotsk 
Sea are found near to the northern Kuril Islands.  
Captures of eggs in adjoining waters of the 
Okhotsk Sea are dated to the Pacific waters, 
entering through the Fourth Kuril Strait at depths 
of about 500 meters.  The branches of the 
Kamchatka-Kuril Currents penetrating through the 
northern Kuril straits, where there is a cyclonic 
system of currents in the Okhotsk Sea, carry eggs 
and larvae from the Pacific side of the northern 
Kuril Islands along the Kuril slope and on all 
water areas of the sea.  Eggs and juveniles live in a 
layer of water located above the deepwater Kuril 
Basin and slope in the central part of the Okhotsk 
Sea. 
 
Benthic aggregations of giant grenadier from the 
Pacific side of the Kuril islands are formed by 
mature fish (75-100% of all giant grenadier).  The 
proportion of juveniles in the benthic aggregations 
in the Okhotsk Sea is significant.  The proportion 
of mature fish here is always much less than in 
 198
adjoining areas.  The Okhotsk Sea is a feeding 
area for juvenile giant grenadier from adjoining 
areas. 
 
The annual migratory cycle of the giant grenadier 
in the northern Kuril Islands and in the Okhotsk 
Sea (Tuponogov 1991,1997) reflects a more 
extended seasonal migration, than was considered 
earlier (up to several hundreds miles) (Fig. 2).  All 
data distributions and biology of giant grenadier in 
both areas correspond to this scheme.  
 
Agreement of the morphometric and genetic-
biochemical analysis suggests that the summer 
distributions of this species in the northern Kuril 
Islands are from two groups - Northern Kuril and 
Okhotsk Sea.  The southern Kuril islands has a 
complex structure and consists of several 
groupings.  Currents transfer and mix eggs of 
different groupings.  Therefore reproductive 
isolation is not present, decreasing distinctions 
between separate groupings (Tuponogov and 
Malinina 1991).  
 
The proportion of immature females is especially 
high in the Okhotsk Sea.  The proportion of pre-
spawning females is small even during spawning.  
The limited spawning can go here in the summer 
in separate sites the Okhotsk Sea.  The larger 
fraction of pre-spawning individuals from the 
Okhotsk Sea moves, during the process of sexual 
maturation to the area adjacent to the Kuril 
Islands. 
 
Migration of the giant grenadier for winter begins 
in the autumn on the Pacific side of the Kuril 
Islands along the slope to the deep Kuril straits.  In 
the winter-spring here, it is not found in 
concentrations comparable with summer. 
 
Longfin codling (Laemonema longipes)  
This species is distributed everywhere in the 
Okhotsk Sea and adjacent waters of Kuril Islands.  
It is a deepwater species living on the slope, and in 
bathyal, meso-, bathypelagic areas.  It is numerous 
in the Japanese and Kuril islands, and only in 
some years in the Alaid area (northernmost 
Kurils).  The fishing conducted in Alaid area, as 
for the Japanese Islands, now carries on in the 
southern Kuril Islands (Pautov 1980; Kodolov, 
Pautov 1986; Savin 1986, 1991, 1993, 1998). 
The scheme of the life cycle was first composed 
by Kodolov and Pautov (1986) was changed (Fig. 
3) by Savin (1993, 1998).  The seasonal migration 
of mature fish is directed toward southwestern 
Honshu coast for spawning.  The pelagic eggs and 
larvae drift from the spawning areas, and early 
juveniles are found north in an area of periodic 
localization of quasi-stationary curls along the east 
coast about Honshu inside the main jet of the 
Kuroshio during its meandering processes.  The 
eddy structure and transverse jets in the Kuril and 
Oyashio currents are favorable for this migration.  
The performances about the schemes of currents 
(Burkov 1980) do not explain the further process 
of moving longfin codling juveniles from Honshu 
in a northward direction to the Okhotsk Sea.  The 
northeast branch of the Kuroshio consists of a 
chain of anticyclonic eddies moving in a 
northward direction (Bulatov 1980).  A large 
anticyclonic eddy can intersect the Subarctic front 
and reach the central Kuril Islands.  The Oyashio 
and its branches have mainly cyclonic eddies. 
Between eddy (curls) of the opposite sign and on 
periphery of chains of one-direction curls, the ink-
jet currents can form.  Migrations from east 
Honshu to the southern Kuril Islands occurs due to 
intrusions of warm waters of a northeastern branch 
of the Kuroshio on north in case of ink-jet streams, 
and also in western sectors anticyclonic and in east 
sectors cyclonic of curls (between cyclones of the 
first branch Oyashio and anticyclones of a 
northeast branch Kuroshio).  
 
After transforming to an active lifestyle, the 
juveniles migrate to the Okhotsk Sea through the 
northern halves of the deep-water straits in the 
southern Kuril islands (especially Bussol).  The 
migrations to the Okhotsk Sea last for 1-2 years.  
The Okhotsk Sea the main area of growth of 
juveniles from age 1 to age 3-5 years, then the 
fattening in the Alaid Strait area for one to two 
years follows.  In the sea of the adults it is not 
enough and 95% of longfin codling makes 1-3 
years.  Such juveniles outside the Okhotsk Sea are 
rare.  After fattening for two to three years in the 
Okhotsk Sea juveniles in process of propagation 
are displaced to the Kuril straits, lengthways along 
the Kuril Islands.  The main migratory route goes 
along Northern Kuril Islands on to the Okhotsk 
Sea side up to deep-water straits.  Then longfin 
 199
codling quits on the ocean side of the Kuril Islands 
through Krusenstern and farther south. 
 
The fattening on the Kuril slope lasts one year, the 
fattening on the small Kuril Islands, for no more 
than one season.  Then the migration to Hokkaido 
and Honshu and addition of trade accumulations 
of the adults follows. See the scheme of annual 
migratory cycle (Fig. 3) composed by Savin 
(1991, 1998).

migration (Savin 1991,1998).  1-spawning area of

10-migration of first matured fish;  11-migration 
of eviction;  12 - transport of yearling (the Roman 
numerals designate months when are adults 
found). 
 
The fattening adult of longfin codling happens on 
the Hokkadio slope from June till December, and 
along the small Kuril ridge, from July till 
December.  The fattening on the slope happens 
mainly for males, females mainly live outside 
slope in waters in the Oyashio.  Part of the adults 
moves lengthways along the Kurils up to northern 
Kuril Islands, and Kamchatka in the summer.  In 
Alaid basin and the Fourth Kuril Strait strong 
cohorts are observed.  The start of maturation for 
Japan starts in August.  The beginning of 
spawning migration to the southern spawning 
areas occurs in October.  It proceeds lengthways 
along Honshu from November up to middle of 
winter - till February.  The majority of individuals 
migrate to depths of 600-900 m and go, at least, in 
two waves.  Spawning occurs in January, and the 
peak occurs in March-April for southeast Honshu.  
To the north, spawning of longfin codling is not 
present, but a little pre-spawning and post-
spawning fish are seen.  The post-spawning 
migration from Honshu occurs from the middle of 
April until June. 
 
Shortraker rockfish (Sebastes borealis) 
Compared to the giant grenadier and longfin 
codling, this species forms aggregations on both 
the Asian and American coasts.  It is more 
numerous in the eastern part of Gulf of Alaska, in 
the southeastern part of the Bering Sea, on 
Shirshov’s Ridge, east Kamchatka, and near the 
Aleutian and Kuriles Islands (Polutov et al. 1966, 
Orlov 2002, 2003).  It is more valuable than giant 
grenadier or longfin codling. 
 
The life cycle was constructed by Orlov (2001, 
2002, 2003) based on distribution and biology in 
separate areas of Pacific Ocean (Tokranov and 
Davidov 1997, 1998; Tokranov 1998; McDermott 
1994) considering the dimensional structure and 
ocean circulation in North Pacific Ocean.  
Shortraker rockfish is a far migrating species 
whose basic areas of dwelling are located within 
the limits of the basic macrocyclonic circulations:  
Alaska subarctic, Western subarctic and cyclonic 
circulation of the Bering Sea (Fig. 4). 
 
Females make extended migrations from feeding 
areas to spawn.  Larvae are widely carried by 
currents on the shelf, settling in bays.  They live 
here in the first years of a life and in process of 
growth are displaced to areas of dwelling for 
mature fish. 
 
The basic areas of reproduction within the limits 
of the western subarctic circulation are, 
apparently, the slopes of Kronozki, Kamchatka 
and Awatscha о bays of east Kamchatka.  One 
more area of spawning, most likely, is the slope of 
the central coast of island Paramushir.

Ocean (Orlov 2002, 2003).  1 - the basic directions of active migrations of adult individuals, 2 - the basic 
directions of passive migrations of larvae and pelagic juveniles, 3 - the basic areas of dwelling of 
juveniles, 4 - the basic of area of reproduction. 
 
 
Large mature individuals concentrate here during 
the aestivo-autumnal period.  The average sizes of 
fish gradually decrease to the south from east 
Kamchatka to Kuriles. 
 
Larvae in the northeast Pacific Ocean appear in 
April (Westrheim 1975), and in various areas in 
the Bering Sea from April till July (Novikov 
1974).  Larvae occur in benthic layers as with 
other deep-water sea perches (Moiseyev and 
Parakezov 1961).  Larvae of rockfish Sebastes 
develop in the superficial covered layers (Barsulov 
1971, 1981).  
 
Larvae from the east coast of Kamchatka, are 
transferred by the East-Kamchatka Current to the 
Kuril Islands.  An insignificant portion pass 
through the North Kuril Strait to the Okhotsk Sea 
and by currents to the southwestern part.  The area 
along the southeast coast of Sakhalin has none.  
 
The fraction of larvae from the western part of the 
Bering Sea can be carried by the East-Kamchatka 
Current through Kamchatka Strait to the east coast 
of Kamchatka and further to Kuril islands.  Larvae 
from the southern part of the Bering Sea can be 
carried to the Pacific Ocean through the straits of 
the central part of the Aleutian archipelago.  
Larvae of British Columbia and Gulf of Alaska are 
transferred by currents to the Aleutian islands.  
They can be carried into parts of the Bering Sea 
through straits along the Aleutian islands.  
 
During passive migrations, juveniles can be late to 
join currents, diverted to underwater heights and 
near to straits creating time-dependent populations 
in these areas.  On a regular basis, they replenish 
migrating of feeding areas with individuals.  Such 
time-dependent populations, by virtue of 
oceanographic features, can be characteristic for 
Pacific waters of the Kuril and Aleutian islands.  
Stable anticyclonic eddies occur from 90-120 
miles from the coasts of Paramushir and 
southeastern Kamchatka above an underwater 
height to the southeast from about Onekatan 
(Lobanov 1983; Stabeno et al. 1994).  Here are 
constantly observed higher catches of mainly 
immature shortraker rockfish.  The pelagic stage 
of development lasts for a long enough time.  
 
 201
Juvenile shortraker rockfish appear in bottom 
trawling catches in the northwest part of Pacific 
Ocean at a length of about 8-10 cm.  Juveniles 
start to pass from a pelagic to a demersal lifestyle 
in the Pacific waters of northern Kuriles at lengths 
greater than 10 cm at an age of 2 years.  They start 
appearing in large trawls at lengths over 15 cm at 
ages of 3-4 years (Leontiev et al. 1998; Orels 
2003). 
 
After transition to a demersal lifestyle, after 
achieving a body length over 30 cm (mainly >40-
45 cm) vertical and horizontal migratory 
behaviour increases.  Some individuals start return 
migrations that can extend for many years. 
Shortraker rockfish is capable of overcoming 
opposing ocean currents.  
 
Mature shortraker rockfish in Pacific waters of 
northern Kuriles and southeast Kamchatka start to 
occur in the catches at 30-35 cm length;  50% of 
individuals have mature gonads at 45-50 cm 
(Orlov 2003). 
 
The annual migration cycle is less well 
investigated. 
 
Shortraker rockfish is a viviparous species with 
internal fertilisation.  Summer and autumn is the 
period between the termination of spawning and 
pairing of the species.  In the autumn during 
pairing and in the spring during larval parturition 
(Novikov 1974; McDermott 1994; Snitko 1986, 
2001) shortraker rockfish remains at certain sites 
on the slope for a long time.  In winter, the males 
and females remain separate.  Juveniles are also 
distributed in separate aggregations at lesser 
depths. 
 
Sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria)  
Sablefish is a very valuable commercial species 
whose distribution is centred toward the Northeast 
Pacific.  The biology and distribution have been 
studied more thoroughly in this area than in the 
Northwest Pacific (Shubnikov 1963; Kulikov 
1965; Kodolov 1976, 1986; Novikov 1974; etc.).  
 
The biological cycle (Fig. 5) was described by 
Kodolov (1986) and Novikov (1974) with 
additions.  Earlier, it was considered that the 
reproductive area for sablefish occurred only in 
the northeastern part, an area including waters of 
Washington-Oregon area, British Columbia, Gulf 
Alaska, and probably California.  Spawning here 
occurs in the autumn-winter period from 
September to February.  It was considered that 
passive drift of the larvae and juveniles occurred 
in a western direction, determined by the current.  
Larvae and juveniles in the first years of life 
remain in the uppermost layers, above the slope.  
Accumulations of juveniles and of nonmature fish 
of length <44 cm are known only east of the 
Aleutian Islands, in the Gulf Alaska and to the 
south.  Juveniles in the Gulf of Alaska make active 
migrations westward.  A significant fraction of the 
juveniles live in the open ocean, far beyond the 
reproductive area.  In the process of propagation, 
migrations occur in the opposite direction.  Before 
sexual maturation, juveniles have a bottom-pelagic 
lifestyle and live in upper layers of water in the 
pelagic, in deeper waters above the shelf, on the 
bottom of the shelf and in top of the continental 
slope.  Mature fish are found throughout a large 
range of depths, from 0 - 2560 m.  By results of 
tagging, sablefish make significant extended 
migrations from the American to the Asian coast.  
But the migrations of the basic mass of the species 
are limited to the eastern part if the northern 
Pacific. 
 
The views of experts were divided on the status of 
sablefish in Asian waters and there link with 
populations on the American coast.  A number of 
researchers (Kodolov 1968, 1976, 1986; Tokranov 
1997; Dudnik et al. 1998; Kim Sen Tok 2000) 
consider the Okhotsk Sea, Kuril Islands, East 
Kamchatka and western Bering water as the zone 
of eviction from reproductive areas on the 
American coast.  It is considered that spawning on 
the Asian coast does not have a stable, regular and 
large-scale character.  Juveniles are seldom found 
here, and the number depends mainly on 
immigration from the eastern Pacific.  But the 
sablefish, even in the western part of the Bering 
Sea, do not have the character of regular mass 
migrations (constant unit deepwater ichthyofauna, 
and in separate sites of North Kuril waters - 
forming a small accumulation, and per 60 years  
 202

(Kodolov 1968; Novikov 1993; Dudnik et al. 1998 with additions). 
 
 
even engaging the significant place in catches 
(Novikov, 1965) in the usual catches of species in 
the northwestern Pacific.  In the Okhotsk Sea from 
separate captures to regular catches throughout the 
Okhotsk Sea, and in the North Kuril Islands and 
Southeast Kamchatka, an increase in number and 
frequency of occurrence (Novikov 1969,1994; 
Dudnik, Dolganov 1992; Orlov 1997; Tokranov 
1997).  It is possible to explain the wide 
circulation and constant occurrence just by the 
migrations of the adults and drifts juveniles from 
the American coast.  
 
The data on distributions of mature and juvenile 
sablefish (yearling, 1 Year, 2 Year) suggest that, 
on the whole, there was weak migratory activity, 
the majority were observed to remain in the area 
of discharge without migrations of a defined 
direction.  In Asian waters, the greatest 
aggregations occur deeper than on the American 
coast.  This is connected to the more severe 
hydrological conditions in the west.  Spawning is 
likely.  The problem of existence of classifications 
up to the extremity is not clarified (Novikov et al. 
2003). 
 
For the sablefish, the northwestwern Pacific is 
most likely, not an area of eviction from the main 
areas.  Here, the populations are common 
constituents in this area of the North Pacific and 
their distribution is more poorly connected to the 
main areas in the eastern part of Pacific than was 
considered earlier. 
 
Conclusions 
1. Giant grenadier, longfin codling, shortraker 
rockfish and sablefish are endemic to the North 
Pacific Ocean.  Their distributions reach a 
continuous arch from the Japanese islands to the 
coast of North America.  These species will not 
penetrate into the Japan Sea because the shallow 
depth of straits.  
 
All four species prefer sites of the continental 
slope with the dismembered relief of the bottom, 
sharp differences of depths and the big biases of 
the bottom.  Food habits are isolated mainly on the 
interzonalplankton, and in smaller measure on 
benthic fauna on the continental slope.  All of 
them are long-lived species with low rates of 
reproduction.  
 
2. Absence of high concentrations of fish eggs 
and juveniles above aggregations of adult fish and 
the high occurrence of these fish in open waters 
testifies to significant horizontal movements due 
 203
to ontogeny and the role of ocean currents.  All 
four species have these characteristics:  
• seasonal prevalence of distribution in currents 
of the year, connected to migratory activity; 
• ontogenetic migrations;  
• interseasonal and interannual differences of 
features of distribution. 
 
Separation of the places of spawning and feeding, 
seasonal distribution and ontogenetic migrations 
reflect the difference of conditions of the 
environment, forage reserves, density of settling, 
competitive attitudes in different areas within a 
year.  The cold temperatures in the Okhotsk Sea 
do not provide most deepwater species the normal 
conditions for reproduction.  Only the black 
halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides matsuurae) 
has managed to reach high numbers at the expense 
of adapting to severe conditions of dwelling 
juveniles. 
 
Giant grenadier, shortraker rockfish and sablefish 
are Pacific boreal species.  Spawning occurs 
during the spring-summer period in warm Pacific 
waters at the Northern Kuril Islands and East 
Kamchatka.  Longfin codling, an Asian speces, is 
more attached to subtropical waters for 
reproduction.  Spawning of the longfin codling 
occurs during the winter-spring period in 
southeastern Japan.  
 
Giant grenadier – a bathybenthic species, only the 
part of adult individuals comes off the bottom on 
significant distances and meets in the thickness of 
water.  It has benthic spawning - more local and 
longer duration.  
 
Longfin codling, shortraker rockfish and sablefish 
– mesobenthic species, forms aggregations at 
shallower depths and smaller areas adhered to the 
bottom, therefore their spawning is also more 
pelagic and consequently more on the area. 
 
Giant grenadier and longfin codling in the 
Okhotsk Sea and at Kuril Islands have oceanic 
(pelagic or planktonic) stages of development and 
are more numerous than sablefish, a flounder, and 
shortraker rockfish (littoral juveniles).  Because of 
distinctions in thermal conditions between western 
and eastern parts of the Pacific Ocean, the pelagic 
period at the Asian coast can be longer, and times 
of spawning are shifted.  
 
The migratory cycles of the species considered in 
the Okhotsk Sea and off the Kuril Islands are 
defined by the nature of drift of eggs and larvae.  
Eggs and larvae are carried by the currents and are 
carried large distances as occurs with many 
pelagic and ground fish.  The role of currents is 
especially great in the development of eggs and 
the distribution juveniles.  The Okhotsk Sea is a 
place of feeding for giant grenadier and longfin 
codling. 
 
3. The scheme of migrations for giant grenadier 
and shortraker rockfish reflect more extended 
seasonal movements than was considered earlier 
(up to several hundred miles).  The routes are 
more hypothetical as little is known about the 
pelagic juveniles of bathyal fish.  Migrations 
routes can be specified by studying the 
intraspecific structure of morphometric, genetic-
biochemical analyses, biology and distribution.  
For this purpose application of distinctions in 
seasonal variability of distribution of aggregations 
of fish, distributions of spawning individuals, 
occurrences of eggs, larvae and juveniles, intensity 
of feed, and fatness is possible.  Tagging is only 
possible to apply on sablefish, for the species 
considered. 
 
Described migration routes have the general 
character.  They can vary appreciablly depending 
on large-scale oceanolographic changes that 
influence the intensity of streams of the basic 
currents in North Pacific and define a level of 
water exchange between the Pacific Ocean and 
Bering Sea.  Variability in ocean circulation 
defines various ways of passive migrations of 
young juveniles and the subsequent numbers of 
adult fish.  The interannual fluctuations in 
numbers is especially seen in the field of eviction, 
which in many respects, are caused by variability 
of oceanographic conditions, particularly the 
intensity of currents.  Change of volume of waters 
entering the Okhotsk Sea also varies the 
emigration of early stage juveniles of giant 
grenadier, shortraker rockfish and sablefish in jets 
of the East-Kamchatka Current that is reflected 
further in the number of adult fish.

Of all species of euphausiids living in the Sea of 
Okhotsk, by abundance and biomass in the 
planktonic community, and in consideration of 
nutrition for nekton, the leading place is occupied 
by Thysanoessa raschii.  Features of her biology 
and ecology require specification (Chuchukalo et 
al. 1996; Shuntov 2001; Zhuravlyov 1984).  The 
basic habitat of this species in the Okhotsk Sea is 
the boreal shelf zone.  The most dense 
aggregations occur at depths up to 200-500 m 
(Volkov 1996; Volkov 2002; Volkov and Efimkin 
2001).  Data on abundance of eggs and nauplii of 
Th. raschii and season in which observation have 
been have been carried out from 1998-2002 are 
recorded in Table 1. 
 
All these years concern the same season, but 
sampled during years of high but variable extent of 
ice cover (Figs. 1, 2).  The spring of of 1998 was 
the first year after the abnormally warm winters of 
1996 and 1997.  The spring of 2001 followed a 
year with maximal ice cover.  The spring of 2002 
followed a winter of high, but less than maximal 
coverage.  Although the season of spawning of 
euphausiids and appearances of the nauplial stages 
in different years cannot be determined to within a 
day, nevertheless its beginning and peak can be 
determined to within a 10 day period.

(1957-2002). 
 
From 1998-2002 in the boreal shelf zone (areas 1-
6 in Fig. 3) spawning had not begun anywhere 
during the first five days of May.  In second five-
day period, the beginning of spawning was 
observed only in 2000 and 2001.  In third five-day 
period, the beginning of spawning was observed in 
all years, but in 2001 separate events of spawning 
in a mouth a hall were observed only.  In 
Shelikhov Bay and in other areas, spawning was 
evident only at the end of May.  In first ten days of 
June, spawning everywhere had a mass character.  
Appearance of the nauplial stages begins normally 
during the last 10 days of May, but in different 
years, it may occur 5-10 days earlier (1999) or 
later (in 2002, the nauplial stages were caught only 
at one station).  The period between the beginning 
of spawning and the appearance the first nauplial 
stage normally takes 12-16 days.  
 
This distribution of biomass of Th. raschii in 
spring has the greatest values across the peripheral 
regions (Fig. 4), that shows and in distribution of 
different size-classes of animals (Figs. 5-7).  
 
Mass spawning begins only in first ten days of 
June and lasts through the second 10 day period, 
and then spawning by those parts of the population 
that, from any one of a number of causes, may 
have matured late.  Most “in due time” dead-ripe

part - jumboes with a length of 20-25 mm.  At the 
beginning of spawning, they are concentrated 
closer to periphery of the shelf, and are most 
eurysynusic and numerous young (10-15 mm) 
which can ripen only by end of summer - to 
beginning of autumn or even by next spring and 
middle-sizes (15-20 mm) which part together with 
large spawning in spring.  All others start breeding 
later. 
 
Thus, eggs and nauplii are the result of spawning 
by animals in the 20-25 mm size-class (from the 
previous year) and in part by the 15-20 mm size-

class of the same year. Furcilia with lengths less 
than 10 mm that are the result of late spawning in 
a year that had to overwinter, therefore their 
abundance in spring is the lowest among other 
size-classes.  
 
The following spring, the overwintering animals 
can become the large size-class part of the 
population.  Accordingly, to reveal “locuses” of 
spawning it is necessary to compare the 
production of eggs and nauplial stages by adults 
born in the same year (15-20 and 20-25 mm), and 
it is possible to judge the dislocation of late 
spawning on allocation of furcilia of lengths <10 
mm.  
 
In March and April spawning does not begin even 
in the warmest waters of western Kamchatka.  
Lower abundance nauplii at end of May - 
beginning of June speaks that spawning began 
only recently and has not yet reached a maximum. 
 
Thus, the basic areas of breeding Th. raschii range 
in shelf zone from depths of 100-200 m.  Clumps 
of large and middle-dimensional euphausiids (15-
20 and 20-25 mm) form adult spawners or pre-
spawning individuals.  
 
In these places it is necessary to expect the 
appearance of plenty of eggs, nauplii, and then 
calyptopis from the beginning to middle of June 
and, with each subsequent stage of development, a 
nucleus of high abundance will be diminished 
more and more, so in the summer and autumn 
seasons, such high concentrations of young and 
 206
adult Th. raschii are not observed.  The animals of 
10-15 mm will most likely begin spawning late in 
the year or in early-autumn;  furcilia achieve 
sexual maturity only in late autumn of the next 
year, but their abundance is insignificant in the 
spring, and in summer, will be even more reduced, 
therefore their influence on the population size is 
insignificant.

The results of investigations of golden king crab, Lithodes aequispinus, from 
eastern coast of Sakhalin Island

The golden king crab (Lithodes aequispinus, 
Benedict) is widely distributed in waters of the 
North Pacific from the shores of British Columbia 
to Honshu Island (Rodin 1970, Jewett et al. 1985, 
Somerton and Otto 1986).  In the Okhotsk Sea L. 
aequispinus inhabits the northern part of the sea, 
near East Sakhalin, western Kamchatka, and along 
the islands of the Greater Kuril Ridge at depths 
from 150 to 800 m (Nizyaev 1992, Shuntov 1997, 
Klitin and Nizyaev 1999).  Results to date 
(Nizyaev 1992, Shuntov 1997) indicate the 
existence of three populations of golden king crab 
in the northern part of the Okhotsk Sea:  Western-

Kamchatka group, North-Okhotsk Sea group and 
East-Sakhalin group (Shuntov 1997).  The East-
Sakhalin group is the smallest of them by number. 
 
The analysis of the East-Sakhalin group was 
carried out according to three aspects:  distri-
bution, commercial parameters (catch on a crab 
pot, mean size of commercial crabs) and some 
biological features of the group (size-frequency 
structure, the size at sexual maturity, fecundity).  
 
Studies were carried out from August to 
November 1997 and 2000 on catcher boats in the 
area between lat. 47°20’N and 51°40’N at a depth 
of 205 – 680 m.  Crab pots (175 × 175 × 80 cm) 
were used.  The carapace length (CL), carapace 
width (CW), right chela height (RCH) were 
measured to the nearest 0.1 mm.  Altogether 7391 
specimens of golden king crab were taken for 
analysis. 
 
Near East Sakhalin Island, the golden king crab 
forms a few small aggregations extended in a 
chain at depths of 200–600 m.  In 1997 
commercial crabs were concentrated in the area 
between lat. 47°30’N and 48°00’N.  In 2000, the 
area of search was expanded (Fig. 1) and two 
aggregations of commercial males were registered.  
One of them is located on the same site, as in 
1997, and another to the north of Mys Triennia, 
within lat. 49°00’N.  The mature females formed 
only one aggregation, which was located in the 
area between lat. 47°50’N and 48°20’N.  Commer-
cial crabs mainly accumulate at depths of 350–500 
m.  The maximum catch (18.3 crabs per pot) was 
registered at a depth of 300 m.  The main part of 
noncommercial males live at depths of 350–400 
m, maximum catch (28 crabs per pot) was found at 
depths of 400 m.  At depths of more than 500 m, 
the catch of noncommercial males is sharply 
reduced.  The only group whose abundance is not 
reduced by a depth of 600-650 m, are mature

immature females were seen mainly at a depth of 
300–450 m. Commercial characteristic L. 
aequispinus of East Sakhalin is submitted in Table 
1. 
 
Near the island of Shiashkotan in 1997- 2000, the 
average catch of commercial crabs per pot was 
35.7 specimens.  Near the island of Iturup, there 
were 25.4 commercial crabs per pot, 6-8 times the 
catch near East Sakhalin.  The mean carapace 
width (CW) size of commercial crabs from East 
Sakhalin is 150.50 mm.  Near the Kurils Islands 
the mean size of commercial crabs is much more;  
the mean CW of crabs on the island of 
Shiashkotan was 178.2 mm.  Crabs of the island of 
Iturup average 161.5 mm (average data from 1997 
– 2000).  
 
The size-frequency distribution of golden king 
crab is shown in Figure 2.  A modal class of males 
is 140-155 mm, and for females at 115 – 125 mm.

Fig. 2 Size-frequency histograms for males 
and females of golden king crab from eastern coast 
of Sakhalin Island. 
The maximum size of males is 200.8 mm, and 
160.9 mm for females.  According to Klitin and 
Nizyaev (1999), a modal class of males is 205 – 
210 mm and the maximum size is 284 mm CW for 
crabs near the northern Kuriles.  The mean size of 
males from East Sakhalin was 143.5 ± 0.3 mm (n 
= 2986), and for males from the island of 
Shiashkotan, 164.1 ± 1.1 mm (n  = 1091), and for 
males from the island of Iturup, 157.2 ± 0.7 mm (n 
= 686).  A pairwise t-test indicated that the mean 
size of males from all comparable groups differed 
significantly (t = 5.1 – 18.4, t
0.95
 = 1.96).  
 
The size at maturity for males (SM) was 
determined by the beginning of the changes in the 
growth allometry of the right chela (RCH) (Jewett 
et al. 1985; Somerton and Otto 1986).  For males 
from East Sakhalin SM = 113.2 mm CL.  
Coefficients of equation of chela growth (RCH = a 
+ bCL) for immature males:  a = 3.32 ± 2.74, b = 
0.17 ± 0.03 (n = 18), for mature males:  a = -29.47 
± 1.67, b = 0.46 ± 0.01 (n =1438).  
 
The size at which 50% of females were mature 
(SF
50
) was estimated by fitting a logistic equation 
to the percentage mature by size (Jewett et al. 
1985).  For females from East Sakhalin SF
50 
= 
107.5 mm CW. Coefficients of the logistic 
equation (Lakin 1976) were: a = 16.07 ± 3.8, b = 
0.14 ± 0.00014.  According to Nizyaev (2002), for 
females from the island of Iturup, SF
50
 = 115.3 
mm CW, and for females from Shiashkotan Island 
SF
50
= 113.6 mm CW.  According to t-test results, 
the differences between coefficients b of logistic 
equation among all compared groups was 
significant (t = 2.51 – 3.94,t
0.95
 = 2.00 – 2.02).  For 
the coefficients, differences were significant only 
 212
between Shiashkotan and East Sakhalin (t = 2.23, 
t
0.95
 = 2.02).  
 
Individual absolute fecundity (IAF) for golden 
king crab from East Sakhalin, calculated according 
to Ivankov (1974), was 7.81 ± 0.68 thousand eggs 
(n=53, CW 97 – 150 mm).  According to Nizyaev 
(2002), IAF for females from Iturup is 7.98 ± 0.45 
thousand eggs, and for Shiashkotan group, 10.96 ± 
0.8 thousand eggs.  Pairwise t-test indicated that 
IAF of crab from East Sakhalin and Shiashkotan 
differed significantly (t = 2.95, t
0.95
 = 1.98) and 
IAF of crab from East Sakhalin and Iturup did not 
differ (t = 0.22, t
0.95
 = 1.98).  
Thus, the first data have already shown the 
existence of some differences between groups of 
golden king crab from East Sakhalin and the Kuril 
Islands.  That testifies to the benefit of assuming 
that these groups should be considered separate 
populations.  However these results should be 
considered preliminary, further studying of the 
peculiarities of these groups will determine its 
rank more precisely and allow recommendations 
for commercial exploration of resources (to 
identify the areas of accumulation, total volume of 
fishing).

The Northwest coastal waters near the Piltun-
Astokh Oil Field, (52°30’ – 53°10’N, 143°20’ – 
144°10’E;  hereafter, Polygon No. 1) and waters of 
Sakhalin Bay (53°40’ – 54°24’N, 140°20’ – 
142°20’E;  hereafter, Polygon No 2) were 
investigated from 3 – 11 October 1988 on R/V 
Akademik M.A. Lavrentyev.  Several indices of 
primary production (PP) were measured:  
1. water transparency and photic layer thickness 
by using of underwater photometer and Secchi 
disk;  
2. chlorophyll a concentration by standard 
method after extraction of pigment by 90% 
acetone from filters;  
3. volume PP rate at light saturation by the 
method with using of label carbon (C14).  
The probes of marine water for analysis were 
sampling from standart horizons of photic layer  
(0, 5, 10, 25 m). 
 
The data were used to estimate daily PP rate of the 
whole photic layer.  For this purpose, our simplest 
model of gross photosynthesis-light relationship in 
form of nonrectangular hyperbola was used 
(Zvalinsky and Litvin 1986, 1988):

 – index of nonrectangular 
hyperbola (for marine alga γ

believed that index I

 corresponds to about 5% of 
the surface irradiance. 
 
After integration of Eq. (1) in the limits of whole

from 8 m on stations that are about 10 km from the 
shore to 15 m at stations that are about 30-60 km 
from shore on Polygon 1.  Such transparency is 
typical for coastal waters.  On Polygon No. 2 the 
same values changed from 6 to 15 meters.  The 
most turbid waters were near the estuary of the 
Amur River (Z

 (Table 1).  At Polygon No. 2, there are 
two places with higher chlorophyll content.  The 
first one was in the southeastern part of polygon, 
near the Amur estuary where salinity was low, up 
to 15psu with mean C
Chl
 = 4.6 mg*m

.  The 
second one was in the northwestern part of the 
polygon where salinity was high, not less then 
31psu (Table 2).  
Volume of primary production   
On both Polygons, the stations near the shore had 
about twice the volume of PP compared with the 
offshore stations (Tables 1 and 2). 
 
The index of activity of phytoplankton 
chlorophyll (assimilation number)   
An had high value for both Polygons (An = 9-14

No. 1, stations nearest to shore had An values 
about 1.5 higher compared with offshore stations.  
An values were similar for all waters of Polygon 
No. 2. 
 
The estimated values of daily primary 
production  
The values were relatively high for waters of both 
Polygons (Tables 1 and 2).  On Polygon No. 1, the 
daily PP of nearshore stations had values of about 
3.4 gC*m

.  In Polygon No. 2, the maximal 
daily PP was seen near the Amur estuary (about

All of the measured and calculated data show that 
investigated waters were highly productive in the 
first half of October 1988.

ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS ON THE OKHOTSK SEA ECOSYSTEM(S)  
(Convenors:  Tatyana Belan, Keiichi Mito and Vladimir Radchenko) 
 
 
Killer whales and Greenland turbot fishery in the Sea of Okhotsk

As an active predator, killer whales (Orcinus orca) 
have broad spectrum of potential prey including 
fishes, cephalopods, sea mammals and even sea 
birds.  With the development of longline fisheries 
for bottom fishes, the spectrum of the killer 
whale’s prey expanded to include the Greenland 
turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), Pacific 
halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), arrowtooth 
flounder (Atherestes stomias), sablefish 
(Anoplopoma fimbria) from the southeastern part 
of the Bering Sea (Yano and Dahlheim, 1995 а).  
Aggressive killer whale behaviour has been 
observed near the vessels longlining for 
Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) in 
waters off the Falkland Islands (Nolan et al. 2000).  
Although these kinds of fishes are not normally 
accessible to killer whales due to depth, the killer 
whales have learned to remove fish from fishing 
gear (longline, bottom nets) during hauling 
operations. 
 
In the Russian Far East seas, longline and bottom 
net fisheries began to develop in the 1990s, but 
until recently, fishermen had not seen aggressive 
killer whale behaviour.  Often these animals were 
observed near fishing vessels and their reactions to 
vessel could be characterized as indifferent.  
However, since 1999, killer whales attacks on 
fishing gear began in the western Bering Sea and 
since the autumn of 2000, in the Okhotsk Sea. 
 
Studies of killer whales were conducted in 
Okhotsk Sea from June to September 2001 (Fig. 1) 
on the longliner Vostok 1.  Data from other fishing 
vessels were also used.  Longlining for Greenland 
turbot was conducted at depths from 400 - 750 m, 
basically in the range of 500-700 m.  A bottom 
longline was 9 - 12.5 km long and consisted of 50-
70 cartridges.  Each cartridge contained 145 hooks 
fixed at 1.2 m intervals.  Eagleclaw #6 hooks were 
baited with herring.  A cartridge was 175-180 m in 
length, requiring an average hauling time of about 
3.5 minutes.  Usually four sets were made daily.

The effect of killer whale predation was estimated 
by comparing turbot catches on the part of the haul 
when the animals were not present, with the 
catches obtained when the animals were present.  
If all of the turbot catch was removed, the 
predation effect was determined by comparing 
with average catches of the nearest fishing 
operations. 
 
Behaviour of killer whales  
After the start of hauling operations, killer whales 
would first appear within 30 minutes or less, and 
after 20 additional minutes, they would reach a 
vessel.  During this period, the catch of Greenland 
turbot was saved from 15-20 cartridges, and orcas 
then consumed the turbot from all hooks 
completely.  Sometimes animals appeared at the 
end of a hauling operation.  If killer whales were 
observed before the beginning of fishing, the 
fishing did not start, and the vessel moved to 
another area. 
 
The predation on fishing gear was mostly due to 
the behaviour of 5-6 individuals, including 1-2 
adult males and 3-4 animals of indefinite sex.  
There were cases when about 20 individuals were 
observed near a fishing vessel, but as a rule, orcas 
kept in separate groups.  In one group, there were 
three individuals with completely white colouring 
without black spots.  One albino was an adult 
male, one was an adult female, and one an 
immature male.  Albinos were sighted in July (two 
events) and in August (1 event). 
 
Killer whales were active usually in the daytime, 
both in calm and stormy weather.  However, cases 
of fishing gear predation were observed at night.  
The killer whales’ behavior varied from June till 
September.  In June and July, orcas took fishes in 
immediate proximity to a vessel, a distance of 10-
15 m from it.  When fishermen used guns or 
various sound bombs, the orcas departed to a 
distance of 100-150 m from the vessel and rested, 
returning but diving to take the fish.  In August – 
September, the killer whales did not approach 
within 200-400 m due to the use of various guns, 
alarm rockets, self-made explosives. 
 
The usual diving time ranged from 5-6 minutes, 
and on the color echosounder monitor, killer 
whales appeared as red curves, like a parabola, to 
a depth of 200 m.  According to Yano and 
Dahlheim (1995), diving time varies from 2 to 
about 10 minutes.  They assumed that orcas start 
to take fish from depths of more than 200 m. 
 
Killer whales removed only Greenland turbot and 
did not eat other species.  Bycatch included skates, 
eelpouts and grenadiers.  There is a customary 
pattern of behaviour.  For example, on August 10-
 217
11, 2001, three longliners were fishing within 
visibility.  Orcas removed the catch from only one 
vessel.  After hauling operation ceased they 
departed to another vessel and returned to the 
original vessel when hauling operation continued.  
The same feature was marked on bottom net 
vessels in October - November. 
 
From January till October, 2001, 809 fishing 
operations were made by the longliner Vostok 1, 
with killer whales affecting 73 of them (9%) 
(Table 1).  Losses of Greenland turbot for 9 
months were estimated to be 92.6 t or 7.0% of the 
catch.  Naturally, these losses were not taken into 
account in total catch by the vessel. 
 
We suppose that other fishing vessels also were 
affected by killer whales in the same way.  And if 
total annual catch of Greenland turbot is known 
we can determine the turbot withdrawal for all 
vessels.  The total annual catch of turbot by 
longliners and bottom nets vessels was 15,600 t, 
therefore the total turbot loss to killer whales will 
be about 1,100 t.  Thus, the general turbot 
removals for the northeastern Sea of Okhotsk was 
17,362 t including annual turbot catch by all gears 
(16,262 t) and predation (1,100 t).  General turbot 
removals did not exceed Total Available Catch 
(TAC) for 2001 for this area (18,000 t).  
 
In summary we shall note, that during 2001 the 
abundance of killer whales and the frequency of 
their attacks on catches of fishing vessels had an 
increasing tendency.

Food supply for the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, in the 
coastal part of the Sea of Okhotsk

The food supply of sea urchins regulates their 
abundance, defines their fecundity and determines 
stocks, and affects their commercial properties.  
As no data had been collected on urchins 
inhabiting the Sea of Okhotsk, the food supply of 
green urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis 
from the coastal North Okhotsk Sea was studied.  
 
It was made a bonitational estimation of the Tauj 
Inlet and Babushkin Bay in points from 0 to 111 
on the basis of simultaneous definitions of 
gonadosomatic indices (GSI), indices of fullness 
of digestive tract (IF) and composition of 
consumed food.  Along with this it was conducted 
daily (24 hours) station to determine daily food 
rations (DFR). 
 
The western part of Odan Bay is estimated as the 
zero point, according to the scale developed.  It is 
characterized by a total absence of algal food, a 
low value of GSI (1-2%) and IF (300°/ooo).  The 
coast of the Umara Island has bad feeding 
conditions (1-11 points) where GSI values do not 
exceed 3-7%, and IF is equal to 300-400°/ooo. 
Kortical algae, Bossiella or detritus prevailed in 
sea urchins’ digestive tracts.  Gertnera Bay has 
relatively good feeding conditions (11-111 points) 
where GSI values increased to 10-12% and IF –up 
to 710°/ooo.  Besides kortical algae, Bossiella, 
sponges, and Polychaeta there were a great 
number of brown algae, mainly Laminaria 
appressirhia in sea urchin digestive tracts.  
Babushkin Bay and the continental side of 
Nedorazumenia Island have favorable feeding 
conditions, where GSI values increased to 18-23% 
(for some specimens, 25-30%), and IF values up to 
940°/ooo, with brown algae, mainly Laminaria 
appressirhiza, L. gurjanova and Alaria marginata 
prevailing in sea urchin digestive tracts (Fig. 1).  
Thus, the inclusion of brown algae to 
Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis ration 
considerably increases the gonadosomatic index. 
 
Fig. 1 Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis 
sampling sites in the northern Okhotsk Sea.  
 
Daily sampling in Gertner’s Bay in June showed 
that the DFR for S. droebachiensis was 3.9% of 
body mass, which is comparable with the DFR 
indices for the grey urchin, S. intermedius, at that 
time inhabiting closed plots along the coast of 
Primorye in June.  It allows model calculations of 
algal food requirements, developed for S. 
intermedius, to be used for S. droebachiensis as 
well (Fig. 2).  The model is based on calculations 
of conformity of Laminaria growth indices and 
daily rations of grey urchin during yearly cycle.  
When the actual quantitative data on biomass of 
Laminaria and sea urchins are entered in column 
“Initial data”, the information of food supply 
sufficiency in the given plot appears in the right 
side of mode.  
 
Conducted investigations make it possible to 
develop the recommendations on improvement of 
food supply for S. droebachiensis in the coastal 
Okhotsk Sea.  For example, algae bottom 
plantations may be created in the western part of 
the Odan Bay by spore seeding the artificial 
substrates or systematically delivering them from 
the eastern part of the Bay to accommodate them 
at the bottom of urchin habitat.

The object of research that took place in the 
summer of 2002 during a research cruise of the 
R/V Buhoro was to study the ways of natural 
structure and regular functioning of ecosystem 
preservation in the face of bottom sediment 
pollution in the area of the Sakhalin offshore oil 
and gas fields.  Bottom sediments are one of basic 
components marine ecosystem.  They are very 
important for the normal functioning of 
ecosystems on the whole because it provdes 
habitat for benthos and is a food source for many 
aquatic animals.  It is also the environment where 
pollutants accumulate.  During the research cruise 
in the summer of 2002, the levels of anthropogenic 
influence on the offshore biocenosis was studied. 
 
In contrast to water that reflects seasonal changes 
and quite frequently accidental effects, the bottom 
sediments accumulate longstanding tendencies of 
biogeochemical processes, and also the magnitude 
of anthropogenic hydrocarbons.  Consequently, it 
reflects the real ecological state of the sea much 
better. 
 
In the research cruise, in situ pollutant sources of 
both natural and anthropogenic origins were 
identified in areas where oil and gas deposits have 
been developed.  For that purpose, the following 
research was conducted: bottom sediment 
granulometric composition; analyses of the 
qualitative and quantitative composition of 
phenols, organic carbon and detergents; water and 
bottom sediments biotesting. 
 
The analyses of complex chemical hydrocarbons 
included:  research of anthropogenic and biogenic 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the quantity 
and contamination of alkanes, and unsubstituted 
arenas.  The gametes, embryos and larvae of sea 
urchins were used as test objects for biotesting.  
Alterations of larval size is an easy and 
informative method of early diagnosis of 
disruption in sea urchin reproduction.  
 
The biotesting indicated that in some particular 
areas, the habitat is hazardous for biota.  Bottom 
sedimentat samples have concentrations of organic 
hydrocarbons (Corg 0.03-1.89%; aliphatic 
hydrocarbons- 2.5-89.9 mkg g
-1
; polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons- 3.1- 58.7 ng g
-1
; 
detergents - 0.3-1.2 mkg g
-1
) more than in 1994.

Natural radionuclides such as uranium – thorium 
and K-40 are concentrated in gas-oil deposit zones 
so the development and industrial use of these 
deposits can lead, inevitably, to contamination of 
technological equipment, industrial wastes, and an 
environment with natural radionuclides (NRN).  In 
this connection, radiocontrol is necessary to 
maintain safety while mining gas-oil materials.  
Monitoring of γ-phone, α- β- γ-activities of the sea 
environment components must be planned. 
 
The object of our investigation in 2002 was to 
determine the concentrations of NRN in the 
bottom sediments taken from Piltoon-Astok and 
Loonskiy oil fields in Northeast Sakhalin offshore 
area.   
 
Measurements of specific activities of NRN were 
conducting with scintillating-spectrometer 
“Progress” using an NaY(Tl) detector in geometry 
“Marinelly”1L.  The duration of exposure was 2-4 
h depending on the activity of samples.  The 
preparation of bottom sediments for measurements 
assumed removing of traces, drying and careful 
homogenizing of sample.  
 
The spectrometric result showed that the 
concentration of NRN in the bottom sediments 
from Piltoon-Astok gas-oil field, after 2 years of 
developing these deposits, did not differ from a an 
analysis carried out in 1977, before drilling.  Thus 
oil mining, at this stage, did not change the 
radiation of this area. 
 
At the same time, the concentration of Ra-226 and 
Th-232 in the bottom sediments within range of 
the Loonsky field increased twice as much, 
although oil mining here did not commence after 
drilling.  Probably the increase is connected with 
changing of granular bottom sediments 
composition owing to mud inclusions, which 
actively adsorb the radionuclides.

The impact of coastal oil-extraction on contamination of the northeast 
Sakhalin shelf with oil products

The issue of anthropogenic contamination of the 
littoral waters by oil hydrocarbons is of particular 
importance, both for the estimation and forecast of 
conditions of highly productive shelf ecosystems, 
and for studying the pathways of hydrocarbons in 
the ecosystem of the Sea of Okhotsk.  The 
objective was to study the pathways of migration, 
transformation, accumulation, and the extent to 
which the offshore zone of the Sea of Okhotsk is 
affected by oil hydrocarbons from the coastal oil 
extraction sites in the northeast of Sakhalin.  At 
present, the major sources of hydrocarbon 
pollution in the offshore zone of northeast 
Sakhalin are the enterprises of oil extracting and 
oil storage located on the northeastern coast of the 
island.  Oil extraction is carried out in 24 oil-fields 
containing 2387 oil wells, of which 2301 are 
operating.  
 
Oil hydrocarbons from oil extraction have 
increased increased several times (in a number of 
cases by an order of magnitude) in the lower 
reaches of rivers.  The high level of oil 
hydrocarbon pollution in the rivers of the northeast 
of Sakhalin is persistent.  Thus, the influence of oil 
extraction on surface water objects results in 
significant oil hydrocarbon pollution.  Recently 
the oil-extracting enterprises have undertaken a 
number of activities to rehabilitate the disturbed 
territories of oil production, and application of 
non-polluting technologies.  
 
The migration of terriestrial oil hydrocarbons in 
the offshore shelf zone of northeastern Sakhalin is 
represented mostly in some lagoon-type bays.  The 
lagoons of northeastern Sakhalin provide a natural 
buffer reservoir for terrristrial discharge and, at the 
same time, are the feeding areas of commercially 
valuable fish species.  
 
Results of the investigations, carried out in July - 
October 2000, have shown that the average 
contents of oil products in the water of the bays 
exceeds by many times, the level of pollution in 
the open part of the sea.  
 
The second prominent feature of oil product 
distribution in the bays was their significant spatial 
variability.  Zones with high contents of oil 
products alternate with the zones where 
concentration of oil products is close to values of 
the natural background.  These sites are adjacent 
to sandy spits as a rule, where the influence of 
river flow is insignificant.  The concentrations and 
peculiarities of the spatial distribution of oil 
hydrocarbons in the bays are determined by the 
isolation of the lagoon and the extent of its water 
exchange with the sea, the volume and the 
contamination of the river outflow, as well as by 
the arrangement river mouth sections. 
 
The maximum average concentrations of oil 
hydrocarbons were recorded in closed lagoons and 
bays having little water exchange with the sea.  
The contents of hydrocarbons in the gulfs Kolendu 
and Ekhabi, with active hydrodynamic processes, 
did not exceed the norm. 
 
Considering the dynamics of concentrations of oil 
hydrocarbons in the bays of northeastern Sakhalin 
during the last decade, it is possible to note that 
there is a tendency of decrease in the level of 
pollution as a whole. 
 
Decomposition of oil hydrocarbons begins as early 
as on the surface of the ground on the technical 
platforms of oil extraction.  High molecular 
homologues that get in the rivers are partly 
decomposed due to the biodegradation as well as 
the influence of the UV-radiation.  So, for 
example, the concentration of oil hydrocarbons in 
the Ombo River is 0.76 mg/l below the oil 
extraction site (Kolendo) is reduced towards the 
mouth of the river to 0.024 mg/l.  Further, the 
 223
transformation of oil hydrocarbons proceeds in the 
lagoons of the northeastern coast.  
 
The available data indicate a change in some 
biological characteristics in those bays suffering 
from persistent oil pressure.  According to N.V. 
Pecheneva, the extent of oil hydrocarbon pollution 
of bottom sediments of the lagoons of northeastern 
Sakhalin influences the value of Shannon’s 
diversity index in benthos communities.  The 
lowest diversity index of macrobenthos was 
recorded for the littoral of the southwestern 
section of the Urkt Bay.  The lagoon of Piltun had 
the greatest value of the index, corresponding with 
the lowest levels of oil hydrocarbons. 
 
In 1996, SakhSIFO carried out an analysis of the 
contents of heavy metals in the livers of bottom 
fishes in the Nyisky Bay.  The results have shown 
that the contents of heavy metals in the inhabitants 
of the bays was higher than in the same species in 
the shelf zone, but it did not exceed permissible 
levels.  
 
Shelf of the open sea 
Long-term observations of the northeastern 
Sakhalin shelf have shown that in general, the 
contents of oil hydrocarbons in the surface water 
layer is stable enough and low, that the transport 
of non-transformed oil hydrocarbons of terrestrial 
origin to the open sea is insignificant.  
 
In general, studies carried out in the area in 1990-
1994 have shown that the concentration of soluble 
aliphatic hydrocarbons and PAHs in surface 
waters varied within rather narrow limits of 10-40 
mkg / l and 5-12 ng/l, respectively.  
 
The influence of the hydrocarbons of terrestrial 
origin and their pathways is more clearly traced in 
the northern part of east Sakhalin shelf from an 
analysis of quantitative and qualitative 
composition of hydrocarbons in the top layer of 
bottom sediments.  
 
Thus, the major processes of oil hydrocarbon 
biodegradation of the products of coastal oil 
extraction sites occur in the lagoons of 
northeastern Sakhalin.  However, the influence of 
hardly decomposed high-molecular and 
transformed hydrocarbon compounds can be 
traced to bottom deposits of the open sea as well.  
 
According to the studies carried out in 2000 in the 
eastern part of the Sakhalin shelf, seawater was 
generally characterized by the low contents of oil 
hydrocarbons.  Increased amounts of oil 
hydrocarbons were observed in the surface layer in 
the water area adjacent to the Gulf of Nabil.  But 
the correspondence of these zones of increased 
hydrocarbon concentrations with some biogenic 
elements in the surface layer suggests the 
existence of a cyclic seasonal eddy in this area. 
 
At the same time, when analyzing the distribution 
of oil hydrocarbons in the bottom deposits in the 
eastern Sakhalin, a local zone of high hydrocarbon 
concentration was clearly pronounced;  the center 
of the concentration reached 200 mkg/g.  
 
Conclusions 
The pathway of oil hydrocarbon migration from 
the coastal oil extraction sites can be traced along 
the rivers to the bays of northeastern Sakhalin.  
The increased concentration of oil hydrocarbons in 
the open part of the shelf zone had an endogenous 
origin. 
 
The major processes of transformation and 
biodegradation of terrigenous hydrocarbons take 
place in the lagoon-type bays, representing natural 
buffer systems.  The part of multinuclear volatile 
compounds and cyclic alkanes, hardly liable to 
microbic decomposition, is taken out into the open 
sea, and affects the composition of the bottom 
deposits in the shelf zone. 
 
The major loads of oil hydrocarbon pollution from 
coastal oil extraction sites are carried by the rivers 
in the zone of their influence.  Cumulative effects 
of oil hydrocarbon accumulation in the bays of 
northeastern Sakhalin require the further 
investigations. 
 
The measures taken and the decrease of the extent 
of pollution by oil hydrocarbons of the rivers and 
the bays during recent years provide hope for 
improvement in the ecological situation in this 
area.

Increasing of methane fluxes in the Sea of Okhotsk in 2002

Methane fluxes have been studied in the shelf, 
slope and deep parts of the Sea of Okhotsk from 
1984 (Obzhirov et.al., 1989, Obzhirov, 1993).  
More intensively, they were investigated by the 
Russian-German project KOMEX from 1988 to 
2002.  After 1988, methane fluxes (hydro-acoustic 
anomalies) increased in the water column of the 
shelf and slope Sakhalin area of the Okhotsk Sea.  
The number of methane flares before 1995 
(Neftegorsk earthquake time) grew from 0 to 
about 30 in North-East Sakhalin Slope.  After 
earthquake it was stable.  In 2002, number of 
flares in this area sharply increased up to more 
then 100.   
 
As the result the following were found:  
1. Increasing methane concentrations in the 
water column from 1988 to 1995 occurred 
before the Neftegorsk earthquake (May 1995).  
After this, methane concentration decreased 
very little and now it has the same high level 
in water column. 
2. Increasing number of methane fluxes (flares) 
in the eastern Sakhalin shelf and slope. 
Bubbles of methane migrate from the 
sediment to the water via a fault zone.  The 
bubbles form a sound-scattering body, like a 
flare.  They come from the bottom to about 
300-500 m and can be distributed to the 
surface and in intermediate water layers in a 
semi-horizontal direction. 
3. Sources of methane are oil-gas deposits and 
destabilized gas hydrates.  
4. Destabilized gas hydrates create 
morphologically low structures in the surface 
sediments and a mineral assemblage with 
carbonate concretions. 
5. Methane concentrations inside the flares are 
more than 20000 nl/l and near flare about 
1000-3000 nl/l.  The sediments in the flare 
areas contain methane concentration of 5-10 
ml/l. 
6. Methane monitoring shows that the surface 
water in shallow areas is anomalously 
oversaturated with methane (>1000 nl/l) in 
autumn and spring seasons.  In these seasons, 
methane is more intensively emanating from 
the surface water to the atmosphere.  
 
Increasing numbers of methane flares and methane 
concentrations from 1988 are connected with 
increasing siesmo-tectonic activity of faults in the 
area of the Okhotsk Sea.  This idea is supported by 
data from mud volcanoes in the East Sakhalin 
area.  Mud volcano activity connected with growth 
of seismo-tectonic oscillations that lead to opening 
of fault zones and gas-fluid migration.  Moreover, 
new mud volcanoes are formed.

Introduction 
At present, the Government of Russia has 
sanctionned industrial development of several 
marine deposits on Sakhalin shelf to a number of 
international industrial corporations.  As shows 
from international experience, the development of 
marine deposits for petroleum and gas production 
does not avoid occurrences of emergencies that 
result in petroleum pollution. 
 
The reality of petroleum pollution necessitates the 
study of mechanisms and rates of petroleum 
degradation in the conditions of the 
northerneastern Sakhalin shelf.  The analysis of 
degradation rates of petroleum, determined in 
various works (e.g. Mishukov and Sokolov 1988) 
has shown that evaporation influences had the 
greatest effect on the composition of petroleum.  
The rates of bacterial and photochemical oxidation 
are close and much more than rates of thermal 
oxidation, especially at low seawater temperatures. 
 
The purpose of the present work was study of oil 
degradation laws by natural condition such as 
wind, intensity of sunlight, thickness of a film, 
temperature and main salt composition of a water 
etc. 
 
Experimental research 
To study photochemical oxidation, two 
installations were developed (Mishukov and 
Sokolov 1988; Sokolov et al. 1984).  Xenon lamps 
were chosen as the light source because its light is 
more close to that of sun light, after filtering out 
the ultraviolet region ( λ <290 nm) and the infrared 
region ( λ >2 µm).  Reactors were thermal at 
appropriate temperatures with an accuracy of 
±0.10°C.  The intensity of light was measured by a 
photodiode and could be varied in the range (0.02-
1.00) Cal/cm
2
*min, which is characteristic of 
northern regions. 
 
The photooxidation rate of petroleum 
hydrocarbons was measured by the change of 
concentration of organic and inorganic peroxides 
by an iodine method (Abramova, Zelenina, 
Mansurov, and Mishukov 1989) and on the rate of 
absorption of oxygen at constant volume of cell. 
 
The object of research was oil from a marine 
deposit at Odoptu, which is classed as slightly 
resin, slight serum content, and slight paraffin oil.  
The physico-chemical properties of oil, circuit of 
the group analysis of petroleum, used by us in this 
work are indicated in our work (Anikiev, 
Mishukov, Moiseevsky, and Tkalin 1988).  
Photooxidation of oil films and oil emulsions was 
conducted on distilled water, on artificial marine 
water, on clean natural marine water from the 
northerneastern Sakhalin shelf, on a water selected 
from Amursky Bay (Sea of Japan) which is 
polluted by wastewaters from the city of 
Vladivostok. 
 
Results of laboratory experiments 
Mechanism of initiation of photochemical 
reactions in petroleum   
To study of the mechanisms of initiation of 
petroleum photooxidation at an initial oxidation 
stage in an oil film or a water-in-oil emulsion, we 
added α-tokopherol athetate, or 
adamantilidenadamantan ( Аd = Ad).  It is known, 
that Аd = Ad actively reacts with a singlet oxygen 
at a constant of rate of 4.6 ×10
5
 l/mole*s, and its 
addition to petroleum at a concentration of 1.27 × 
10
-5
 mole/l caused a sharp increase of oxidation 
rate measured by absorption of oxygen.  Addition 
of α-tokopherol in other case completely 
suppressed photooxidation of petroleum as 
indicated by absorption of oxygen, and production 
of peroxide.  It is known, that α-tokopherol is a 
quencher of excited levels of molecules and active 
acceptor of free radicals.  Thus, formation of 
singlet oxygen and its participation in oil 
photooxidation on a water surface was established 
 226
that is agreed data of work (Larson and Hunt 
1978). 
 
Influence of temperature on oil photooxidation 
A study of the influence of temperature on oil 
photooxidation was conducted on a surface of 
artificial marine water at a thickness of a film of 
0.29 mm, at a light intensity of 65 mCal/cm
2
 *min.  
The curves of peroxide accumulation have an S-
like image.  On tangency of a corner of a 
inclination to initial sites of experimental curve the 
significance of initial photooxidation rates (Win) 
are calculated.  The account in coordinates ln Win 
- f (1/ Т) has given significance of energy of 
activation ( Еa) at photooxidation equal 46.6 
kJ/mole. 
 
Influence of film thickness on oil photooxidation 
The study was conducted on an artificial marine 
water surface at a light intensity of 65 mCal/cm
2
 
*min and water temperature of 278°K and oil film 
thicknesses (h) of 0.19, 0.29, 0.59, 0.79 mm.  
Curves of peroxide accumulation, from which the 
initial rates of photooxidation (W
in
) were 
calculated and the dependence W
in
 on film 
thickness also, have an S-like image. In 
coordinates ln (W
in
) - ln (h) a kind of dependence 
has been defined W
in 
= h 
1,1
. 
 
It appears that the decline of the initial 
photooxidation rate with the reduction of thickness 
of a film is connected with suppression of singlet 
states of molecules and deactivation of radicals on 
surfaces of a film, though the specific absorbed 
energy per unit of volume of a film grows.  
Indirect confirmation of the influence of surface 
thickness on photooxidation rate is related to 
peroxide output from the composition of the 
underlying water.  The photooxidation rate and 
peroxide output had maximal significance on 
distilled water.  On marine water from clean 
regions, the peroxide output grows, and on marine 
water from polluted regions, after about an hour 
illumination, it reaches maximum significance, 
and then decreases. 
 
Influence of light intensity on oil photooxidation 
Study of the influence of light intensity (I
il
) on 
initial photooxidation rate of petroleum (W
in
) was 
conducted on a surface of distilled water and 
marine water.  The data processing in coordinate 
ln  (W
in
) - ln (I
il
) has shown that the dependence 
has the kind W
in
 ∝ I
il
2
.  Such kind of dependence 
testifies to a two-quantum mechanism of 
photooxidation at an initial stage. 
 
Influence of temperature on photooxidation of 
“oil in a marine water” emulsion 
The oil-in-water emulsion was prepared from 
artificial marine water using a magnetic mixer, 
adding drops of oil up to concentration of 1% by 
weight.  The intensity of light was 50 
mCal/cm
2
*min.  The peroxide concentration was 
calculated by volume of petroleum.  On kinetic 
curves, the initial photooxidation rate (W
in
) was 
calculated.  The dependence of peroxide 
concentration (ROOH) on time at temperatures 10-
20°C - linear, at 30°C at 120 minutes of 
illumination, it reaches a maximum, and then is 
reduced.  Initial rates of accumulation of ROOH 
on marine water were 10-40% below that on 
distilled water.  Account in coordinates ln(W
in
) - f 
(1/ Т) has shown that the energy of activation is 
equal to (39.6 + 4.3) kJ/mole. 
 
Natural experiments 
Natural experiments were conducted on the 
Northeast coast of Sakhalin Island.  In the first 
series of experiments, at temperature of water 5°C, 
it was shown that immediately after placing oil on 
a surface of marine water, a change of physico-
chemical structure occurs.  Saturated hydrocarbons 
with numbers of carbon atoms up to 12 quickly 
evaporated.  The absorption of light caused the 
formation of peroxides, which are accompanied by 
increasing resins and asphaltenes in oil. 
 
In a second longer series of experiments, formalin 
was added to half of the reactors with marine 
water (final concentration - 5%) to suppress 
biological processes.  One half of the reactors with 
formalin and without formalin were placed in a 
completely open area, and the other half were 
placed under a screen (height of 0.5 m).  The 
influence of biological processes to change of the 
concentration of analyzed hydrocarbons was not 
marked.  
 
The decline of aromatic hydrocarbons (PhH) in 
reactors placed under the screen was slower than 
those located in the completely open area and was 
 227
influenced only by evaporation of these 
hydrocarbons. 
 
Oil photochemical oxidation appeared as an 
increase of peroxide concentrations and a fall of 
aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations and in the 
growth of concentrations of asphaltenes (Asph) in 
the oil.  The resin contents changes only slightly. 
 
In the third series of experiments, the 
transformation of oil on a surface of natural ice on 
the Northeast coast of Sakhalin was studied.  
Reduction in concentrations of saturated 
hydrocarbons in oil films by evaporation was 
considerably slower than in the autumn 
experiments.  Growth of peroxide concentrations 
and concentrations of asphaltenes was observed as 
was a reduction of the content of resins. 
 
Conclusions 
1. Fast transformations of the chemical 
composition of oil were observed after spilling 
it on surfaces of water and ice, under the 
weathering processes at northeast coast of the 
Sakhalin. 
2. Evaporation and photochemical oxidation of 
oil hydrocarbons were the most intensive 
processes, which change the oil composition.

The current state of fisheries (aside from the 
Pacific salmon fishery) in the eastern Sea of 
Okhotsk has been analyzed in this work.  The 
area studied was bounded by 153°30’ Е 
longitude from the west and by 50°N latitude 
from the south (Fig. 1).  The contribution of this 
area was more than 20% of total Russian harvest 
in the Pacific Ocean.  The principal object of 
fishery, providing almost three-quarters of the 
total harvest, was walleye pollock.  Flatfishes 
were next in the contribution;  Pacific cod and 
saffron cod took the position after the flatfishes.  
The role of halibuts and sculpins has been 
important.  The volume of the other species in 
the harvest (Pacific herring, rays, grenadiers, 
smelts) was insufficient, also it might be higher. 
 
Different species have been harvested in 
different seasons.  The walleye pollock fishery 
has been carried out from January to April (95% 
of the annual harvest, in the average for 1999-
2001, Fig. 2).  It has been accomplished during 
prespawning period at the motherland slope and 
shelf by mid-water trawls.  For an example the 
Figure 1 demonstrates the disposition of walleye 
pollock fishery trawlers in March 2003.  In the 
other months this species has been harvested as 
by catch.  Pacific cod has been harvested mostly 
in the period from December to April (92% in 
average for 1999-2001, Fig. 3).  By late summer 
the harvest of Pacific Cod has been insufficient.  
The Pacific cod fishery has been carried out with 
long-lines at the motherland slope and with 
Danish seines at the shelf. Pacific cod 
distribution in summer 2001 is demonstrated in 
the Figure 4.  Danish seines are used for the 
fishery of saffron cod mostly.  The fishery area 
has been situated at the less depth being 
compared to that in the fishery area of walleye 
pollock and Pacific cod.  This conclusion has 
been illustrated by the Figure 5, where saffron cod 
distribution in summer 2001 has been demonstrated.  
Saffron cod have been exploited differently within 
the southern (southward from 54° N) and northern 
parts of the area studied.  In the first part mentioned 
intense fishery has been observed in winter-spring 
period (52% for January-May);  in the area 
northward up to 90% of saffron cod have been 
harvested from May to September inclusive.  These 
peculiarities perhaps might occur due to the 
extensive square of the ice cover in the North-East 
Sea of Okhotsk from January to April.  In average 
from 1999 to 2001 annual dynamics of Saffron Cod 
harvests in the area studied was more stable being 
compared to that of Pacific cod and walleye pollock 
(Fig. 6).

Flatfish have been harvested with Danish seines 
at the shelf mostly from April to September 
(77% in average from 1999 to 2001, Fig. 7).  
Principal part of the harvest consisted of yellow-
finned sole.  Distribution of this species in 
summer 2001 has been demonstrated in Figure 
8. 
 
During the last two years total harvest in the area 
studied has been reduced by more than 200 × 
103 tons or almost by 40% in the other words 
what indicates of the necessity to enhance today 
fishery regulation.  That requires us to know the 
composition of species in the catches by the 
types of fisheries.  Several different types of 
fishery have been used currently in the eastern 
Sea of Okhotsk including walleye pPollock 
trawl fishery, halibut trawl fishery, flatfish 
bottom-seining (Danish seine) fishery, Pacific

majority of fishery types is multi-special.  This 
circumstance should be taken into account for 
regulation of fishery what has been reckoned as 
monospecial till now.  Total commercial harvest has 
been assessed for every species and has been quoted

statistics what, in its turn, causes mistaken 
estimation of fishery intensity and stock abundance.  
In our view, total harvest of all species mentioned 
above should be recommended by species for every 
certain area of fishery and with the type of fishery

The Sea of Okhotsk is the primary fishery region 
in the Russian Far East:  it provides about 65-
70% of total Russian catch.  Pollock, herring, 
Pacific salmon, cod, flatfish and crab are the 
main commercially important species.  Pacific 
salmon (pink, chum, coho, sockeye, chinook and 
cherry) spend some time inside the Okhotsk Sea, 
and they spawn in freshwater rivers.  Recent 
assessments suggest that there are about 230 
million t (mt) of benthic biota in the Okhotsk 
Sea, 35 mt of fishes, 3.5 mt of squids and 0.5 mt 
of marine mammals (Lapko and Radchenko 
2000).  
 
The most productive zones of the Okhotsk Sea 
are shelves of the North-East Sakhalin Island 
and the west side of the Kamchatka Peninsula 
due to very intensive water dynamics and high 
content of nutrients.  Thus, average 
concentrations of chlorophyll a in the 0-50 m 
layer can reach 4-5 mg m
-3
 (Mordasova and 
Metreveli 1997).  These areas are characterized 
by high biomass of phyto-, zooplankton and 
benthos.  For example, average biomass of 
phyto- and zooplankton at the NE Sakhalin 
Island shelf in 0-100 m layer often exceeds 1000 
and 2000 mg m
-3
, respectively.  Average benthos 
biomass varies from a few grams to a few 
kilograms per square meter (Smirnova 1959; 
Volkov and Chuchukalo 1985; Tkalin and Belan 
1993; Belan and Oleynik 1997; Shuntov 2001).  
The highest density of bottom fishes is observed 
on the western Kamchatka Peninsula shelf.  This 
area is the place of reproduction and migration 
of Kamchatka crab and Pacific salmon.  The NE 
Sakhalin Island shelf traditionally is the fishery 
area of bottom and pelagic fishes and many 
other species (Borets 1990).  On the other hand, 
huge deposits of oil and gas are found in these 
shelf areas of the Okhotsk Sea.  Two major offshore 
oil fields at the NE Sakhalin Island shelf – Arkutun-
Dagi and Piltun-Astokh fields – contain 73.5% of 
total recoverable reserves of the Sakhalin shelf oil.  
Commercial oil extraction has already started in the 
Piltun-Astokh field;  the Kamchatka shelf is 
considered as a prospective area.  
 
Ecological monitoring of the marine environment 
was carried out by specialists of FERHRI in the 
1990s.  According to the data obtained at the end of 
1990s, benthos biomass and abundance had 
considerable fluctuations.  The highest biomass was 
recorded in the northern part of the NE Sakhalin 
Island shelf (Piltun-Astokh, Arkutun-Dagi) where 
the sea urchin Echinarachnius parma dominated.  
Average benthos biomass of study areas considered 
to be more than 1000 g m
-2
.  The highest density was 
detected in the southern areas of the NE shelf 
(Lunskoye field).  Polychaetes, amphipods and 
bivalves prevailed in terms of number of species. 
Actiniaria, Polychaeta, Bivalvia, Amphipoda, 
Cumacea, Echinoidea and Gastropoda were 
characterized by the highest occurrence, abundance 
and biomass.  
 
Distribution of benthic communities had a mosaic 
pattern, and it was depended on the sediment types 
(and on near-bottom hydrodynamics activity).  
Monodominant communities (E. parma and D. 
bidentata) characterized by maximum biomass and 
lowest species diversity, were recorded on the fine 
sands.  The most rich and diverse polydominant 
communities in which few species prevail (E. 
parma, polychaetes Nephtys caeca, Ampharete 
lindstromi, and sea anemones Halcampa vegae, 
Epiactis sp.) were found on the coarse sand and 
gravel.  These communities were characterized by 
low biomass (Belan and Oleynik 2000). 
    
 235
Suspended-feeders (E. parma, D. bidentata, 
bivalve Peronidia lutea) and sessile animals (sea 
anemones, sponges, hydroids, some polychaetes) 
dominated on the trophic structure of benthic 
assemblages in Piltun-Astokh field.  
Communities of deposit-feeders (polychaete A. 
proboscidea, bivalves Y. seminuda, Y. myalis) 
and suspended-feeders (amphipods Ampelisca 
eschrihti and A. macrocephala) were common 
on the soft silts in Lunskoye field (Belan et al., 
1996). 
 
Data obtained in 1990s have shown background 
pollutant concentrations in seawater and bottom 
sediments and healthy status of pelagic and 
bottom communities at the NE Sakhalin Island 
shelf.  Coastal ecosystems were characterized by 
high richness, diversity and productivity as they 
were in 1970s and 1980s.  Changes in bottom 
communities near movable drilling rigs were not 
detected yet (Tkalin and Belan 1993; Belan and 
Oleynik 1997, 2000).  However, increasing 
commercial oil extraction may cause negative 
affects on coastal ecosystems of the NE Sakhalin 
Island shelf.

From August 2 to September 9, 2001, seismic 
surveys for oil and gas off northeast coast of 
Sakhalin were conducted on behalf of 
ExxonMobil in the Odoptu polygon, in the 
vicinity of the only known feeding area of the 
critically endangered western gray whale 
(WGW) Eschrichtius robustus.  Only about 100 
individuals are known to survive to date.  From 
August 2 to August 14, calibration experiments 
aimed at determining the acoustic transmission 
properties in this area were conducted.  Active 
seismic acquisition occurred from August 17 to 
September 9.  Marine mammal aerial surveys 
were carried out in this area between July 19 – 
November 19, 2001, using an Mi-8 helicopter 
and an An-28 airplane.  The objectives of the 
aerial surveys were to monitor the status of all 
marine mammals in the area and help mitigate 
potential effects of seismic activities on them, 
particularly on feeding WGWs.  During the 
study period, a total of 131 aerial surveys were 
conducted.  In total, 1404 groups including 1792 
WGWs were seen by all observers on all 
transects (excluding the feeding plumes with no 
associated WGWs).  This number includes 
multiple resightings of the same animals. 
 
The most significant result of the 2001 aerial 
surveys was the detailed study of a new major 
WGW summering and feeding area, the 
“Offshore area”, 25-40 km offshore between 
Nyysky and Chayvo Bays (Fig. 1).  This area 
was discovered on September 9 by our 
colleagues Mikhail Maminov (TINRO) and Yuri 
Yakovlev (IBM); in the next two months, 22 
intensive aerial surveys were flown over it.  The 
largest number of WGWs that was recorded on 
transect on a single aerial survey in the Offshore 
area (An-28) was 43 (53 gray whales were recorded 
on- and off-transect).  In the Piltun Bay area, the 
largest number of WGWs recorded on and off-
transect on a single survey was 39 (Mi-8).  This 
discovery changed our views on the current status of 
WGWs.  During the previous 18 years of studies, 
only one feeding area of WGWs (the Piltun Bay 
area) was known.  By November, the observed 
number of WGWs in both feeding areas off 
northeast coast Sakhalin decreased appreciably; the 
likely reason was the departure of many WGWs in 
the direction of their (still unknown) wintering 
grounds.  Aerial surveys of WGWs in the Piltun Bay 
area carried out during seismic exploration did not 
show a change in their numbers during this time.  A 
certain redistribution of WGWs within the Piltun 
Bay area was observed.  During active seismic 
acquisition, some whales moved to the southern half 
of the Piltun Bay feeding area, away from where the 
seismic survey was being carried out.  Even though 
the distribution of WGWs in the Piltun Bay area 
fluctuated over the July – November period, that 
particular shift indicates that the seismic exploration 
had some effect on the distribution of WGWs.  
There are no data showing that this effect was 
significant:  the observed numbers of WGWs did not 
change, so the whales did not seem to have left the 
Piltun Bay feeding area.  Aerial surveys showed that 
the whales continued to feed throughout the seismic 
activity.  There was no difference in the intensity of 
feeding throughout the feeding season (before, 
during and after seismic acquisition), except at the 
very end of it in November the feeding intensity 
decreased.  The discovery of a new major WGW 
summering and feeding area in the Sea of Okhotsk 
indicates that WGWs are more widespread in their 
distribution and more flexible in their feeding 
behavior than previously reported.

Marine Mammal Mitigation and Monitoring Program for the 2001 Odoptu  
3-D Seismic Survey, Sea of Okhotsk, Sakhalin Island:  A possible future 
industry standard

The Odoptu Marine Mammal Mitigation and 
Monitoring Program was based on the findings 
that the key environmental issue for the planned 
seismic program was protection of the western 
gray whales (WGWs, Eschrichtius robustus) that 
spend most of the ice-free season feeding off the 
northeast Sakhalin coast.  WGWs are listed as 
endangered in the Russian Red Book and critically 
endangered by the International Union for the 
Conservation of Nature (IUCN).  In addition, over 
the past few years some individual whales have 
been reported as emaciated due to unknown 
reasons.  Given these considerations, the primary 
goal for the mitigation and monitoring programs 
was to minimize potential impacts of the seismic 
program on the feeding activity of WGWs. 
 
Earlier studies (1983-2000) showed that feeding 
WGWs mainly stayed in the area near the mouth 
of Piltun Bay and northward along the northeast 
Sakhalin coast (hereafter referred to as the “Piltun 
Bay feeding area”);  >95% of all WGW 
observations in this area were located shoreward 
of the 20 m isobath.  The key concept in the 
mitigation strategy was to establish a buffer 
distance between feeding WGWs and the seismic 
vessel that would allow the whales to continue to 
feed without being displaced from the Piltun 
feeding area.  The monitoring program was to 
ensure that the seismic vessel would stay at or 
beyond the buffer distance from feeding WGWs. 
 
The Odoptu seismic block was divided into two 
sub-areas (Areas A and B).  Area A was the area 
within the seismic block extending 4 km seaward 
from the 20 m isobath.  The buffer distance of 4 
km was based on seismic experiments conducted 
near feeding eastern gray whales in the Bering Sea 
(Malme et al. 1986, 1988).  These studies 
indicated that 10% of the gray whales showed 
major modifications to behavior (ceased feeding 
and moved rapidly away from the vessel) when the 
received sound levels generated by a seismic ship 
were greater than 163 dB re 1 µPa rms.  It was 
found that the sound attenuated to the 163 dB re 1 
µPa rms level over a distance of 4 to 5 km from 
the seismic vessel.  In 2001 in the Odoptu area, 
calibration experiments with active seismic ship 
were conducted prior to the start of the actual 
seismic survey to establish the buffer distance at 
which the sound was attenuated to the 163 dB re 1 
µPa rms. 
 
Seismic acquisition in Area A was restricted to 
periods with good visibility and daylight so that 
the location of whales could be determined.  With 
the help of aerial over-flights and vessel-based 
surveys, shooting seismic lines in Area A was 
carefully planned to maintain the established 
primary buffer distance from all observed gray 
whales.  While shooting in Area A, continuous 
observations were made by vessel-based marine 
mammal observers (MMO’s) onboard the seismic 
acquisition vessel M/V Nordic Explorer and two 
support vessels, M/V Rubin and M/V Atlas.  
Systematic observations were also made by the 
MMO’s while shooting in Area B.  Observers 
aboard the M/V Rubin provided additional 
intensive MMO coverage along the landward edge 
of the 4-5 km buffer distance from the seismic 
ship while shooting occurred in Area A. 
 
Area B was the area within the Odoptu seismic 
block boundary that was at least 4-5 km seaward 
of the 20 m isobath. Seismic acquisition in Area B 
adhered to the same buffer distances implemented 
in Area A.  However, because very few gray have 
ever been documented in Area B, surveys in Area 
B were not restricted to daylight hours or periods 
of good visibility. 
 
 239
The gray whale mitigation and monitoring 
program designed and carried out before, during 
and after the 2001 Odoptu seismic survey was the 
most stringent and comprehensive program of this 
type ever conducted in the world for a marine 
mammal.  As such, it may serve as a prototype of 
a future world-wide industry standard of 
mitigation/monitoring programs in relation to 
offshore seismic surveys.  The program included 
four components:  round-the-clock vessel-based 
observations, (near) daily aerial surveys, 
behavioral studies of WGWs and acoustic 
monitoring of the WGW feeding area. 
 
The overall conclusions of the four main 
mitigation/monitoring/research programs are 
summarized below. 
 
Vessel-based studies 
• No flight behavior by gray whales was 
observed by any of the vessel-based marine 
mammal observers during the study period, 
nor were any unusual gray whale activity 
patterns observed. 
• A previously unknown WGW feeding area 
was discovered offshore from Chayvo Bay 
(south-east of the Piltun Bay feeding area) in 
waters 30-45 m deep.  This discovery 
indicates that WGWs are more widespread in 
their distribution and more flexible in their 
feeding behavior than previously reported.  
 
Aerial surveys 
• Overall, 131 systematic aerial surveys were 
conducted in the Piltun Bay area and other 
adjacent areas on the northeast Sakhalin shelf 
in 2001.  The WGW feeding, distribution and 
abundance data were analyzed using several 
statistical methods, including BACI analysis 
and quasi-likelihood multiple regression, to 
determine if an effect on WGW feeding 
activity, distribution, or abundance occurred 
during the Odoptu seismic survey.   
• None of the statistical analyses showed a 
statistically significant relations between 
seismic activity and WGW feeding activity.  
Whales continued to be present and to feed in 
the same feeding areas as in 1999 and 2000. 
• A southward shift in the distribution of some 
(average ~ 3-4) of WGWs from west of the 
Odoptu block was statistically correlated 
(P<0.05) with the period of seismic 
operations.  Such movements did not exceed 
the range of shifts of WGWs in the Piltun area 
during the feeding season.  In other feeding 
areas, shifts in eastern gray whale distribution 
have been linked to changes in prey 
distribution and availability (Bass 2000, 
Dunham and Duffus 2001, 2002).  The 
distribution and availability of WGW prey in 
the Piltun area was studied in 2002, and the 
results are pending. 
 
Behaviour studies 
• WGWs remained present near the Odoptu 
seismic block and continued to feed west of 
the Odoptu block throughout the seismic 
survey period.  No trends in WGW 
abundance were correlated with seismic 
activity. 
• All 11 gray whale behavior variables 
measured were statistically correlated 
(P<0.05) with environmental variables.  This 
result highlights the necessity of considering 
environmental variables when evaluating 
potential industry effects on gray whale 
behavior. 
• Average values of most behavioral 
parameters studied during the Odoptu 2001 
study were similar to those recorded in 
previous behavior studies in the Piltun area.  
Parameters that differed were either not 
correlated with seismic activity or the 
differences could not be explained by the 
effects of seismic, i.e., expected seismic 
influences would have changed the 
parameters in a direction opposite to that 
expected from a seismic-related influence 
(i.e., blow interval). 
• Multiple regression analyses indicated that 
five of 11 behavioral parameters studied in 
2001 were statistically correlated (P<0.05) 
with Odoptu seismic activity.  Behavioral 
parameters that were correlated with seismic 
activity showed effects of limited duration 
(highly transient) and generally within the 
range of variation attributable to 
environmental effects. 
• Multiple regression analyses indicated that 
six of 11 behavioral parameters studied in 
 240
2001 were not statistically correlated 
(P<0.05) with Odoptu seismic operations. 
• These results suggest that the stringent 
mitigation measures employed to limit 
exposure of WGWs to high sound levels 
mitigated potential impacts on the behavior 
of these whales to very low levels. 
 
Acoustic monitoring 
• The 4-5 km buffer zone was effective in 
limiting sound exposure levels for WGWs. 
• Acoustic monitoring at the 20 m contour, 
which generally defines the outer edge of the 
WGW Piltun feeding area, showed that 
received sound levels during the seismic 
survey were consistently below the target 163 
dB re 1 µ Pa rms threshold in Area B of the 
seismic survey area. 
• Acoustic monitoring provided crucial 
information used to estimate seismic sound 
exposure levels for WGWs, which were used 
to investigate the effects of seismic activity on 
feeding activity, distribution, abundance, and 
behavior of WGWs in the Odoptu area.

In 2002-2003, oil spill modeling was carried out 
for four potential oil spill scenarios in the Aniva 
Bay and La Perouse Strait areas (Table 1).  Oil 
spills near Prigorodnoe village are regarded as a 
potential result of increasing emergency 
probability under Sakhalin-2 project development 
with the planned construction of an oil-refining 
plant and marine terminal.  La Perouse Strait is an 
area of on-going and projected tanker operations 
with a higher risk to navigation due to intensive 
hydrodynamics and strong winds.  Korsakov is the 
largest Russian port in Aniva Bay and here the risk 
of emergencies is also high.  The areas specified 
are included in the Regional oil spill response plan 
and regarded as the highly dangerous sites. 
 
Typical hydrometeorological scenarios were 
constructed using a method that had already been 
successfully applied for oil spill statistical 
modeling on the eastern Sakhalin shelf (Kochergin 
et al. 2000a).  The method incorporates 
typification of wind situations at the coastal 
hydromet stations, reconstruction of wind fields 
with the help of re-analysis data, calculation of 
non-tidal currents by a linear baroclinic model, 
calculation of tidal currents by instrumental data 
and the final composition of hydromet conditions 
for the trajectory oil spill modeling. 
 
The typical wind fields were constructed from 15-
year data from five coastal hydromet stations 
(Krilion Cape, Novikovo, Salmon Bay, Korsakov 
and Kirilovo) and surface winds from the 
retrospective analysis (NCEP NOAA).

Typical wind situations were chosen from a 
frequency table constructed for the hydromet 
station closest to the oil release point.  
Typification is based on the combined wind 
direction and velocity gradations, taking into 
account the regional climatic features, influence of 
surface winds on surface current formation, 
frequency of a given situation, oil transport 
specificity and expert assessments (Table 2).  In 
addition, situations with extremely strong wind 
velocity and rare occurrences were defined.  Every 
wind situation is supported with average vectors 
calculated at the points with synchronous 
measurement series and subsequent interpolation 
of those vectors in the regular grid for the 
investigated area. 
 
Hydrodynamic calculations using an Ekman-type 
linear baroclinic model (Budaeva and Makarov 
1999) resulted in the construction of diagnostic 
current schemes for each selected wind situation.  
Water density fields were constructed by the 
historical oceanographic data sets (RODC 
FERHRI, 1948-1992) and data of the hydrological 
surveys in Aniva Bay conducted by SakhNIRO in 
2002. 
 
Tidal current fields were calculated by extracting 
harmonic constants out of the series of 
instrumental current observations and interpolating 
them into the regular grid with account of spatial 
variability of the amplitude and phase of the six 
main harmonics. 
 
The fate of oil in the sea was modeled by the VOS 
3 Model developed in FERHRI (Kochergin et al. 
2000b).  Output results include oil transport 
trajectories with oil locations specified in time 
(Fig. 1) and other characteristics.  The model 
results allow estimating the most probable oil 
transport trajectories under the summer, autumn 
and winter (no ice case only) conditions.  Oil 
weathering processes (evaporation, dispersion, 
emulsification, etc.) were assessed using POI FEB 
RAS model (Michoukov and Abramova 1997) and 
ADIOS II model developed in NOAA and MMS.  
 
The following conclusions were made from the 
modeling results for statistically reliable situations.  
In the case where oil was spilled in the northern 
part of Aniva Bay in summer, the oil will be 
transported southward to the open sea (over 60% 
probability), although oil reaching the beaches due 
to southern winds is also likely (about 30% 
probability).  In autumn the oil will be transported 
either to the east of the bay under the western 
winds (over 30% probability) or to the south under 
the northern winds (about 30% probability).  Oiled 
beaches in the north of the bay are also probable 
(about 15% probability) under the southern winds.
 243
 
Fig. 1 Examples of potential oil spill trajectory modeling results:  (a) spill nearby vil. Prigorodnoe 
(light north winds situation), (b) spill in the water area of Korsakov harbour (autumn typical and 
extremely strong winds situations) and (c) tanker accident in the La Perouse Strait (summer typical 
winds). 
 
 
In winter, the oil will be transported to the south 
(75%) and the south-east (10%).  The current tidal 
phase is not significant for the oil spills in the 
north of Aniva Bay as the tidal current velocity is 
low. 
 
Modeling of the potential oil spills in La Perouse 
Strait shows that in summer the oil will be 
transported towards the Sea of Okhotsk along 
Hokkaido Island or oiling beaches on it (50%) or 
be transported to the south of Aniva Bay (35%).  
In autumn the oil may be transported towards the 
Sea of Japan (30%) or to the east (60%), but 
unlike the summer results, oil is not transported to 
the coastal zone of Hokkaido Island within 6 days.  
Oil transport to Aniva Bay is only 9% probable. In 
the rest of the cases, oil is transported to the east.  
In winter, oil is transported to the Sea of Japan 
 244
(about 35% probability), but in rest of the cases 
the oil is transported southeastward, parallel to the 
coast of Hokkaido Island.  It should be noted that 
the current tidal phase is of great significance here 
as the tidal current velocity may amount to 2 m s
-1
 
(both in the eastern and western direction).  This is 
especially critical for oil spill response plan 
development.

Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii Val.) distribution grounds on northeastern 
Sakhalin Shelf (Okhotsk Sea)

Pacific herring spawn in numerous shallow-water 
bays off northeastern Sakhalin from late May 
through mid-July.  After spawning, local herring 
migrate for foraging to shelf waters off 
northeastern Sakhalin (Frolov 1950; 1968; 
Andreyev 1963). 
 
Bottom trawl surveys performed in August-
October 1989 from 6 to 30 m deep and in 1991-
1992, 1997-2002 from 20 to 500 m deep made it 
possible to determine the distribution of Pacific 
herring during foraging on the northeastern 
Sakhalin shelf.  
 
Bottom trawl catches show that the frequency of 
herring occurrence ranges between 20-30%, on 
average.  During the summer season, juvenile fish 
swim up to 20-30 m deep and separately from 
mature fish, rarely forming mixed aggregations.  
Major aggregations of juvenile fish 5-14 cm long 
are attached to bay areas.  Small numbers of fish 
travel up to 50°N latitude.  
 
Mature herring swim throughout the coastline. 
Major aggregations, nearly 70%, are concentrated 
nearly 100 m deep and rarely at 200 m deep.  
There are three areas of herring localization within 
the shelf: the area north 52°N, the area of Lunsky 
and Nabilsky bays, and a small portion south 51°N 
where fish swim no deeper than 50 meters (Fig. 1).  
Noteworthy, bigger fish that reach 29 to 32 cm 
migrate north of 52°N, 17 to 23 cm long fish 
predominates in the southern and central portions 
of the shelf.  Scientists also detect the Okhotsk 
population of herring in the northern areas of the 
shelf (Shuntov 1998; Melnikov and Kuznetsova 
2002). 
 
Most probably, major aggregations of Pacific 
herring are attached to the areas of thickest 
zooplankton concentrations on northeastern 
Sakhalin shelf (Bragina 1999).  Examinations of 
herring stomachs found zooplankton of neritic and 
oceanic groups that are typical of shelf waters off 
northeastern Sakhalin.  Herring diets are based on 
euphausiids, calanoid copepods, and cumaceans.  
Most herring slow foraging and reach high fat in 
August and September.

Modeling results of the impact of dredging on the 
marine environment within the first stage of the 
Sakhalin-1 project are compared.  Comparative 
modeling covered two activities:  (1) site leveling 
including dredging and soil dumping (5,000 m
3
) 
and (2) the construction of an underwater pipeline 
including trenching, temporary soil storage on the 
sea bottom and trench backfilling (over 800,000 
m
3
).  The area modelled is on the northeastern 
Sakhalin shelf, off Chayvo Bay. 
 
The impact was modeled using the models that 
were previously approved for application in 
Sakhalin oil and gas fields development projects:  
VOSTOK model developed in FERHRI 
(Kochergin and Bogdanovsky 2003) based on a 
Lagrangian approach and the AKS-ECO model, 
developed in CC RAS and Environmental Centre 
IFPA (Arkhipov et al. 2000) based on an Eulerian 
approach.  Both models were tested with in situ 
experiments and justify their applicability.  
Unified input data used in both models included 
technical parameters of the impact sources (rate, 
time of operation, location, soil granulometric 
composition, etc.) and general requirements for 
hydrometerological scenarios. 
 
For comparitive purposes, the output results were 
made the same in kind (the same gradations and 
units).  The following output results were 
compared:  the curves of the maximum extent of 
suspended solid concentration depending on the 
distance from the source, the average volumes of 
contaminated water by the concentration 
gradations, the lifetime of waters contaminated 
with a given concentration of suspended solids, 
and the size of formed bottom sediments by height 
gradations.

sediments formed on the sea bottom during site

The comparison of modeling results shows their 
relatively good convergence.  The highest 
convergence is achieved when calculating the 
sedimented area on the sea bottom (relative 
difference within 0-35% for different gradations).
 248
This testifies to the use of approximately the same 
calculation parameters of solid particles 
sedimentation velocities.  Comparison of 
calculated water column contamination parameters 
shows that both models produce almost the same 
results for the suspended solid concentration in the 
plume of more than 10 mg/l (10-30%), while 
results may be considerably different (up to 70%) 
if the concentration is low.  Differences in the 
modeling results are analyzed and possible reasons 
are given.  Comparative diagrams constructed over 
calculation results of both models are shown in 
Figure 1. 
 
Thus, despite the difference in approaches used in 
modeling, two different models give comparable 
results.  The models can be used to calculate the 
complex impact on marine environment especially 
produced by dredging operations and pollutant 
discharges.

Assessment of the environmental quality of the shelf and the slope top 
horizons of eastern Sakhalin in relation with the heavy metals content in 
bottom sediments

The east coast of Sakhalin and especially its 
northern part is a sparsely populated area with 
underdeveloped industry and agriculture.  But in 
the northern and northeastern parts of the island, 
open and working oilfields and gas-fields are 
concentrated.  Each year, the effect on the rich 
natural complex of this area grows in connection 
with the development of new oilfields.  A 
combination of fishing, on the one hand, and 
various economic activities on the other hand, and 
concern for environmental features causes the 
need to estimate the chemico-ecological 
conditions of marine ecosystems to maintain their 
normal functioning.  Documenting the 
environmental quality in these areas is especially 
significant as it will serve as background 
estimation before large-scale development of 
petroleum hydrocarbon resources, adjoining to the 
Sakhalin shelf, occurs.  As a result of increasing 
pollution, chemical substances including toxic 
heavy metals fall into the sea environment.  It is 
known, that increasing of the metal content in the 
environment negatively influences to existence of 
marine organisms. 
 
Heavy metals in bottom sediments of sea water are 
due to a number of factors:  geomorphological 
features of water areas, terrestial drainage, output 
of underground waters, and wind phenomena and 
climatic conditions.  Accumulation and 
distribution of metals are influenced by 
hydrodynamic mode of the seas, physical and 
chemical processes and processes of biogenic 
sedimentation. 
 
The migration of metals in the seas is connected to 
their transition in the “water – bottom sediment” 
system.  Values of this factor and the scale of its 
negative influence on reservoirs increases 
considerably with growing anthropogenic 
influence.  At the first stage, increases of metal 
concentrations in water causes their accumulation 
in bottom sediments.  With a change in the 
dynamic balance, and as a result of physical, 
chemical, and microbiological processes, heavy 
metals that accumulated earlier can migrate from 
bottom sediments to the water, thereby influencing 
the quality of environment and creating, under 
certain conditions, a secondary pollution danger in 
the embayments.  Therefore the level of metal 
concentrations in bottom sediments is one of the 
indicators of embayment pollution.  Pollution of 
marine sediments is connected directly with the 
development of human economic activities.  
Proceeding from this, the content of heavy metals 
in bottom sediments can be considered as an 
integrated parameter of marine environmental 
pollution.  The level of pollution is determined by 
the comparison of metal concentrations in 
sediments (conditionally background) in water 
areas that are subjected to, and not subjected to 
anthropogenic influences. 
 
The purpose of the present work was to assess the 
marine environmental quality of the shelf and the 
slope top horizons of east Sakhalin in relation to 
the content of heavy metals:  copper, zinc, nickel, 
chromium, lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic in 
bottom sediments.  Bottom sediments for the 
analysis were collected in June - July 2002 on the 
shelf and the slope top horizons of Sakhalin. 
 
Measurements of iron, zinc, chromium, nickel, 
copper concentrations were carried out by an 
atomic-absorption spectrophotometer “Nippon 
Jarrell Ash” model АА-855.  Determination of 
barium was carried out in flame N
2
O - acetylene. 
 
Concentrations of cadmium, lead and arsenic were 
determined by atomic-absorption 
spectrophotometer “Hitachi” 170-70.  
Concentration of mercury was determined by 
 250
flameless atomic-absorption spectrophotometer on 
the microanalyzer “Hiranuma” Hg - 1. 
 
Maximum concentrations of copper were 
determined in bottom sediments of Terpenia Gulf. 
There was 8-12 mg kg
-1
 dry weight.  The lowest 
concentration was characteristic for northeastern 
part of the investigated area where the range of 
copper concentration was 0.5-4.5 mg kg
-1
 dry 
weight. 
 
Maximum concentrations of zinc were found in

 were found in the

Taking into account that nickel is an indicator of 
marine pollution by petroleum, it is possible to 
assume that its increased concentration in the 
sediments of this area is caused by pollution by 
mineral oil. 
 
Spatial distribution of lead, cadmium, mercury and 
arsenic in bottom sediments of the shelf and the 
slope top horizons of eastern Sakhalin was rather 
smooth.  Some increased concentrations of these 
elements were found near Terpenia Gulf:  lead – 
11.2 mg kg

, cadmium – 0.093 mg kg
-1
, mercury – 
0.046 mg kg

that the content of lead in bottom sediments of 
polluted waters can reach up to 640 mg kg

, 
cadmium up to 4 mg kg

, mercury up to 10 mg  
kg

. 
 
In bottom sediments of the shelf and the upper 
slope eastern Sakhalin, acid-leachable forms of 
iron, barium and aluminium were found.  At 
present, the concentrations of these metals 
corresponds with the natural background of this 
area. 
 
Thus, it is possible to conclude that concentrations 
of acid-leachable forms of copper, zinc, nickel, 
chromium, lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic in 
bottom sediments of the shelf and the upper slope 
of eastern Sakhalin currently corresponds with the 
natural geochemical background of the area 
investigated.  Individual stations with increased 
concentrations of metals are revealed.  The present 
research confirms the necessity of monitoring 
toxic element contents in bottom sediments in 
connection with expansion of the economic 
activities, including oil recovery on the shelf of 
Sakhalin.

The walleye pollock fishery in the Sea of Okhotsk 
has a rather long history.  In 1950s, walleye 
pollock were harvested by Japanese fishermen. 
Pollock were also bycatch in the Pacific cod and 
flatfish seine fisheries.  Walleye pollock was 
harvested by Soviet fleet.  A specialized Russian 
fishery for walleye pollock in the Sea of Okhotsk 
started in 1963.  The annual harvest was 15 × 10
3
 
t, approximately (Fig. 1).  From 1966, a Korean 
fleet started harvesting walleye pollock.  The 
fishery developing rapidly until 200 vessels were 
active by 1969;  removals increased much more.  
The fishery has been carried out generally in the 
eastern Sea of Okhotsk, where the principal 
spawning grounds are situated (Fig. 2);  
economically the most effective fishery occurred 
when the fish were aggregated for reproduction. 
 
In 1974, the maximum removasl for the whole 
period (1340x10
3
 t) was observed.  The 
contribution by the Japanese fleet was 501 × 10
3
 t 
approximately, and 100 × 10
3
 t by the Korean 
fleet.  From 1975 until 1981, the harvest was 
declining in relation to the declining stock 
abundance (Fig. 1).  Growth of biomass afterwards 
provided harvests of 1265 × 10
3
 t in 1984.  For 
1985-94 the harvest was about 700x10
3
 t, on 
average.  From 1995-97, catches in the eastern Sea 
of Okhotsk increased significantly up to 1035-
1153 × 10
3
 t;  it was not related to an increase in 
biomass.  From 1998, pollock harvesting in the 
eastern Sea of Okhotsk coincided with OCP 
recommendations, however, it decreased steadily 
to no more than 300x10
3
 t in recent years (Fig. 1). 
 
In the 1960-80s, the walleye pollock fishery in the 
eastern Sea of Okhotsk occurred from January to 
July.  This period is the most favorable due to the 
fact that the fishes create dense aggregations 
within a limited area during the spawning and 
prespawning period.  In particular years (1971, 
1975, 1977-79, 1981) the fishery was carried out 
in November-December, however, that was not 
reckoned as a profitable endeavour because of 
poor catches and unfavorable weather.  As the 
state of walleye pollock stock abundance in the 
eastern Sea of Okhotsk has been unfavorable, the 
fishery is allowed only after January 15 until the 
mass spawning starts, and not later than April 1 
and out of the boundaries of the spawning 
grounds.

years. 
 
Until 1977, walleye pollock harvests in the Sea of 
Okhotsk were not limited.  A forecast of the 
harvests used to be made according to the fishery 
abilities of the fleet.  The forecasts of Okhotsk Sea 
walleye pollock stock abundance and the prospects 
based on aspects of the biology for nearest two 
years began from 1976 (in 1974), but OCP has 
been forecasted since 1980, made possible due to 
the methods of OCP and stock abundance 
forecasting.  Since 1972, the biomass of adults in 
the eastern Sea of Okhotsk has been estimated 
from egg survey data.  In the 1980s, virtual 
population analysis models of stock abundance 
have been used. 
 
Walleye pollock biomass in the eastern Sea of 
Okhotsk varies annually due to the abundance of 
different cohorts, which is related mostly to global 
climate change influencing the effectiveness of 
reproduction and survival.  From 1972 to 2002, 
spawning stock biomass (SSB), assessed from the 
ichthyoplankton surveys, produced estimates that 
varied from 1009 – 4175 × 10
3
 t, 2172 × 10
3
 t on 
average (Fig. 3).  Similar estimates were obtained 
from an extended analysis of survival model,  
XSA).  
 
From 1997, SSB in West Kamchatka declined to 
be, in 2001, similar to that in 1979, i.e. 1059 × 10
3
 
t.  However, the further biomass increases did not 
follow afterwards.  According to the forecast in 
2003, the biomass should increase up to 2000 × 
10
3
 t, approximately at the expense of the 1997 
recruitment, but in 2004 it has to be reduced again 
(Fig. 3).  The principal cause is the absence of 
abundant recruitment.

Fig. 4 Estimated abundance of 2 year old walleye pollock in the eastern Sea of Okhotsk, by year of 
sampling. 
 
 
From the results of the XSA model, the estimates 
of average recruitment for the recent five years 
was equal to 1406.5 × 10
6
, about six times lower 
than the longterm average (Fig. 4).  The 
abundance of a weak 1998 cohort (observed in 
2000), of 470.8 × 10
6
 individuals was followed by 
an even weaker 1999 cohort; at 185.5x10
6
, it was 
an historical minimum for this stock.  The 2000 
cohort is considered as more abundant and 
promising so the stock abundance enhancement 
before should be estimated as medium abundance 
generation. 
 
The fishery decreases the potential abundance of 
walleye pollock generation significantly.  
Representatives of many generations have been 
observed in the catches from the age of 1-2-years.  
According to the long-term observations, all 
walleye pollock of <32 cm length have not been 
processed, but thrown overboard.  That, for 
example, explains the fact that abundant 
generation 1995, that could have provided the 
growth of stock abundance since 1999, has been 
too poor to the age of 6 years.

Biological parameters of snow crab, Chionoecetes opilio, and walleye pollock, 
Theragra chalcogramma, in the southwestern area of the Okhotsk Sea in 
summer

Bottom trawl surveys were conducted to collect 
information on the distribution and biological 
parameters of the snow crab Chionoecetes opilio 
and walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma in 
the southwestern area of the Okhotsk Sea in 
summer, 1997-2001.  Water temperatures at each 
station were measured by XBT (Tsurumi Seiki 
Co.) and Memory STD (ALEC ELECTRONICS 
CO.). 
 
For each haul, the fish captured were sorted into 
species, counted and weighed.  Captured snow 
crabs were measured for carapace width (CW), 
chela height (CH) and body weight.  Male 
maturity was determined by analyzing the CW-CH 
relationship to determine the morphometric 
maturity.  Female maturity was determined by 
examining for the presence or absence of eggs 
attached to the abdomen.  Snow crabs with blat 
mat syndrome (BMS) were counted.  Captured 
walleye pollock were measured for fork length, 
body weight, and gonad weight.  Daily otolith 
rings from pollock in 1999 were counted and 
hatching dates estimated. 
 
Almost all snow crabs were collected from depths 
of 100 - 300 m, and especially high densities 
occurred in the depth range of 150 - 200 m.  Only 
a few occurred at depths greater than 300 m (Fig. 
1).  The size distribution of collected crabs was 
significantly larger by depth for both male and 
female (data not shown).  The range of bottom 
temperatures at the stations where the snow crabs 
were collected was between –0.96°C and 7.05°C, 
and temperature of stations where more than 500 
individuals · km
-2
 were collected ranged between -
0.96°C and 5.77°C (Fig. 2).  The CW at which 
50% individuals had finished the terminal molt 
was estimated at 106.0 mm and 63.4 mm for males 
and females, respectively (Fig. 3).  Annual 
changes of snow crab biomass estimated from the 
survey did not agree with those of catch by 
fisheries trawler (Fig. 4).  The period of the survey 
(August) was different to the main fishing season 
(May).  There were only a few individuals infected 
with BMS among the collected snow crabs during 
the survey period.  However, there were a lot of 
snow crabs with BMS in May.  Judging from these 
results, it was suggested that snow crabs might 
migrate from the Japanese EEZ to outside during 
the period June through July. 
 
The biomass of walleye pollock was stable at a 
low level through the survey period with no clear 
strong year-class observed in recent years.  
However, it was considered that the 1999 year-
class was dominant based on pollock size 
distributions during 1997-2001 (Fig. 5).  In 1999, 
the observed modal length was 95-105 mm (Age 
0), in 2000 it had increased to 225-245 mm (Age 
1), and in 2001 to 320-340 mm (Age 2).  Age 0 
fishes were mainly distributed in the depth range 
of 100 – 300 m, and age 1 fishes were distributed 
over all depths surveyed, and age 2 fishes were 
mainly sampled at the depth range of 150-200 m 
and over 300 m.  It seems that pollock 
distributions, with increasing age and size, move 
from shallow to deeper areas.  It was considered 
that the 1999 year-class hatched in late February, 
based on daily rings of otoliths.  From the 
estimated hatch date of the 1999 year class and the 
pollock spawning period around Hokkaido, it 
indicates the possibility that the spawning ground 
of the 1999 year-class was not the Okhotsk Sea 
but the Japan Sea.
