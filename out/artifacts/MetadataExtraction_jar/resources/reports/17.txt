EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
This volume summarizes the results of the activities in 2000 by the four Task Teams of the PICES-
GLOBEC Climate Change and Carrying Capacity Program.  The activities reported here include the 
BASS, MODEL, MONITOR and REX Workshops at the PICES Ninth Annual Meeting in Hakodate, 
Japan (October 2000), and the joint BASS/MODEL Workshop in Honolulu, U.S.A. (March 2001). 
 
The BASS Workshop on “The development of a conceptual model of the Subarctic Pacific basin 
ecosystems” discussed the possibility of applying ECOPATH/ECOSIM to the modeling of subarctic gyre 
ecosystems, based on presentations, the extended abstracts of which appear in the report.  The workshop 
participants recognized that the Program has now entered its synthesis phase and the role of modeling has 
become more important.  They have recommended convening a joint BASS/MODEL Workshop to 
examine the feasibility of using ECOPATH/ECOSIM as a tool to model higher trophic level components 
of the subarctic gyre ecosystems.  This joint workshop on “Higher trophic level modeling” was held 
March 2001, in Honolulu.  The initial eastern- and western- subarctic gyre ecosystem models were 
reviewed and existing data used for each model were noted.  The workshop found considerable room for 
improving the estimates that can be accomplished by improvement of input data quality.   
 
The MODEL Workshop on “Strategies for coupling higher and lower trophic level marine ecosystem 
models” discussed the strategic considerations necessary in coupling higher and lower trophic level 
marine ecosystem models and the extension and improvement of the prototype lower trophic level PICES 
NEMURO Model.  The workshop reported these strategies in the form of workshop recommendations, 
which can be re-organized and re-stated in the future workplan of the CCCC Program for integration.  
The workshop report also contains abstracts, extended abstracts, and fully prepared reports presented at 
the workshop.  
 
The MONITOR Workshop on “Progress in monitoring the North Pacific” reviewed ongoing and/or 
planned monitoring programs in North Pacific and made a number of pertinent recommendations.  The 
summary of the workshop is followed by extended abstracts of papers given at the meeting. 
 
The REX Workshop on “Trends in herring populations and trophodynamics” summarized generalizations, 
observations and hypotheses on herring populations and identified the need to add F (fish) into the current 
crop of NPZ (Nutrients - Phytoplankton - Zooplankton) models that are now available. 
 
The four Task Teams are coordinating their activities in order to reach their goal, namely to answer the 
scientific questions addressed to the Program and to develop the ecosystem-monitoring program as an 
output of the Program.  The final recommendations from each of these Task Teams can be found in the 
PICES Annual Report 2000.

BASS WORKSHOP ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CONCEPTUAL 
MODEL OF THE SUBARCTIC PACIFIC BASIN ECOSYSTEMS 
(Co-convenors:  Gordon A. McFarlane, Richard J. Beamish, Akihiko Yatsu and Andrei S. 
Krovnin) 
 
 
At the PICES Sixth Annual Meeting, the BASS 
Task Team sponsored a symposium on the 
Ecosystem dynamics of the eastern and western 
subarctic gyres.  The purpose was to bring 
together available information on the two gyres in 
a comparative framework.  Topics included:   
1) ocean responses to climate forcing,  2) nutrients 
and primary production,  3) structure of the lower 
trophic levels, the mesozooplankton communities, 
and the epipelagic nekton,  4) the role of midwater 
fishes, and  5) the importance of these areas to 
marine birds and mammals.  Papers presented at 
the meeting were published in 1999, in a Progress 
in Oceanography special issue entitled Ecosystem 
Dynamics in the Eastern and Western gyres of the 
Subarctic Pacific (Guest Editors:  R.J. Beamish, S. 
Kim, M. Terazaki and W.S. Wooster).  The 
following “key” research problems were pointed 
out during discussion at the symposium:  1) the 
need for information on short-term or seasonal 
changes in the mixed layer,  2) how climate-
variation may be changing the stability of the 
water column,  3) the role of iron: understanding 
transport mechanisms,  4) community dynamics 
and the need for small scale diet studies, and   
5) biomass estimates of some “key” species. 
Members of BASS Task Team felt that the next 
step should be to develop a conceptual model of 
the subarctic Pacific basin ecosystems and begin 
to examine appropriate models.  A 2 -day BASS 
Workshop on this topic was convened prior to the 
Ninth Annual Meeting in Hakodate, Japan 
(October 20-21, 2000).  The objective of this 
workshop was to identify appropriate approaches, 
not only modelling approaches but also how to 
develop studies which will answer some of the 
questions. 
 
At the workshop, a number of presentations were 
made on ecosystem models that participants had 
used.  These models were reviewed and discussed 
with respect to their utility for gyre systems.  
Trophodynamic linkages that were likely to be 
common, as well as those that were model-
specific, were identified, and shortfalls were 
highlighted.  Discussions included identifying data 
groups and potential data sources, incorporating 
climate and oceanographic change in models, and 
linking gyre models to coastal area models.  The 
following section contains extended abstracts of 
papers given at the workshop. 
 
 
Investigating ecosystem dynamics with ECOPATH/ECOSIM

Two applications of the ECOPATH/ECOSIM 
modelling approach are presented.  The first 
constructs an ECOPATH model of the central 
North Pacific pelagic ecosystem, using ECOSIM 
to investigate the response of the ecosystem to 
fishing impacts.  The ECOPATH model is highly 
resolved at the top trophic levels including species 
groups for each of the principal fishery target 
species as well as fishery impacts of 6 types of 
fishing gears.  The ECOPATH model was used in 
the dynamic ECOSIM to simulate the response of 
the pelagic ecosystem to an elimination of all 
fishing:  a return of the ecosystem to the early 
1900s.  The ECOSIM model simulation found all 
the fished species increased in the absence of 
fishing but a number of prey species including 
squid, flying fish and lancet fish, decreased as 
their predators increased.  Furthermore, for the top 
trophic level species, large sharks and blue 
marlins, their biomass increased more than all 
other fished species because they benefited from 
both an absence of fishing as well as an increase in 
1
  
their prey, small tunas and billfishes, species 
which increased in biomass when fishing was 
halted. 
 
A second application of these models was a 
bottom-up simulation.  An eastern tropical Pacific 
pelagic ecosystem model was constructed and 
used to simulate the ecosystem response to 
changes in ENSO periodicity and cadence, and 
long-term global warming.  The ENSO impacts 
were s imulated by changing the phytoplankton 
availability in the ECOSIM model.  An El Niño 
was simulated by a 30% drop in phytoplankton 
during one year and a La Niña was simulated with 
a 30% increase in phytoplankton for one year.  
The global warming scenario was simulated by 
using predicted changes in SST from a 100-year 
global warming modelling exercise.  The predicted 
eastern tropical Pacific SST was converted into 
phytoplankton biomass with an empirical 
relationship between these parameters for the 
eastern tropical Pacific.  The ECOSIM results 
found that bottom-up forcing propagates through 
the 6 trophic levels of the ecosystem with time 
lags and amplitude of the forcing which varies by 
species and can be greater or weaker than the 
initial forcing.  Changing the ENSO period results 
in modest changes in trophic transfer and 
ecosystem structure.  For example, less energy 
reaches the top of the ecosystem when El Niño 
events occur every 2 years compared to every 6 
years.  However, the global warming scenario 
which predicted warming of SST, an increased 
vertical stratification and hence reduced 
phytoplankton in the eastern tropical Pacific, was 
simulated by the ECOSIM model to result in a 
substantial decrease in the entire ecosystem 
biomass at all trophic levels.  
 
These and other experiences with ECOPATH and 
ECOSIM suggest that these models are useful 
tools to investigate the responses of complex 
ecosystems to both top-down and bottom-up 
forcing.  However, issues remain regarding how 
well the models capture the complexity of actual 
ecosystem dynamics.  More evaluations of model 
results with actual ecosystem dynamics are 
needed.  There is a considerable literature on 
applications of these approaches and a web site 
“www.ecopath.org” which serves as a source for 
the programs and related literature. 
 
 
ECOPATH as a potential tool for modeling the North Pacific Gyre ecosystems

The subarctic North Pacific oceanic gyres contain 
highly productive pelagic ecosystems.  These 
waters have been subject to past fisheries and are 
important rearing areas for Pacific salmon 
(Oncorhynchus spp.), marine mammals and 
commercially harvested squid.  Furthermore, the 
species of the region responds to oceanographic 
signals on the order of decades, and thus they 
present a case study for the interactions between 
climate and marine ecology.  However, the 
ecosystems of these regions are poorly understood, 
in part due to the difficulty of obtaining consistent 
data across such large systems.   
 
Extensive biological data exist for these regions 
and have been gathered by PICES member 
countries.  It would be extremely useful to 
assemble these data to provide a meaningful 
quantification of ecosystem structure and function.  
To this end, the software package ECOPATH may 
be a useful tool, as it helps researchers in modeling 
oceanic food webs, and provides a meaningful 
context for comparing estimates of biological 
production across species and regions. 
 
ECOPATH is simply a tool for comparing 
independent estimates of biomass, production, 
consumption and diet, migrations, and fisheries 
catch of the important players in a food web.  Such 
comparisons help determine: 
- if available estimates are consistent between 
species; 
- the relative importance of species or guilds 
within an ecosystem; and 
2
  
- how targeting increased research effort on 
critical, keystone species might aid in 
improving our understanding of the system’s 
structure and function.   
 
In cases where two similar ecosystems are to be 
compared, such as with the eastern and western 
subarctic gyres, ECOPATH provides a 
quantitative basis for comparison. 
 
Creating an ECOPATH model should be a 
strongly collaborative process among participating 
scientists.  The framework of ECOPATH lends 
itself to an iterative peer-review process between 
the primary modelers, the data collectors, and the 
wider scientific community.  There are five main 
steps in creating a model: 
- determining the model framework;  
- assembling and documenting the initial data; 
- assessing the data in preliminary models; 
- peer-review of data and preliminary models; 
- use of models to test hypotheses. 
 
Determining the model framework  To set up a 
modeling effort, the boundaries, time period, time 
step, species of interest, and important hypotheses 
for the system must be identified.  While these 
identifications may change as the model develops, 
it is important to have some preliminary 
framework to aid in collecting data.  This stage 
may also identify key data sources and providers.  
Generally this task may be completed in a series of 
discussions over a short time period. 
 
Assembling and documenting the initial data  Data 
assembly and documentation may take from weeks 
to months depending on the ecosystem in question.  
This process may involve contacting researchers in 
many institutions to provide data to a central 
source.  At the same time, the quality of the data 
may be assessed and adjustments made to the 
model framework if necessary. 
 
Assessing the data in preliminary models  The 
initial assembly of data for an ECOPATH model is 
best conducted in a workshop setting with a 
limited number of participants who are familiar 
with aspects of the data.  The purpose of such a 
workshop is to view the pieces of data as a whole 
for the first time, and make preliminary 
judgements on the quality of the data and the 
usefulness of the model.  At this stage, plans may 
be made to revisit hypotheses or attempt to refine 
data estimates. 
 
Peer-review of data and preliminary models  After 
an initial workshop, participants should be able to 
show the initial model to a wider community over 
a period of months.  This process allows additional 
input to be gathered to improve the model.  
Successive iterations of data exchange during this 
period will substantially improve the model.  In 
addition, the model may be used to direct further 
data collection. 
 
Use of models to test hypotheses  When the peer-
review process has reached the larger research 
community, the models may be d istributed and 
used to compare the relative roles of anthropo-
genic effects, predator-prey interactions, climate 
changes, or dynamic function of the ecosystem 
through a variety of modeling techniques. 
 
ECOPATH, like all models, is a simplification of 
nature.  However, the quantitative, iterative peer-
review process has in many cases contributed to an 
increased understanding of the ecosystem’s 
structure and function.  Overall, ECOPATH is a 
powerful tool for assembling and synthesizing 
ecosystem data from disparate sources.   
 
 
Modeling the western Bering Sea ecosystem with help of ECOPATH software

The purpose of our presentation is to identify some 
methodological aspects substantially affecting, or 
even defining, the quantitative appearance of the 
model, and as a result the applied conclusions 
derived from the model.  This modeling work was 
initiated by our colleagues from the National 
3
  
Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA, U.S.A.) with 
the goal of constructing an ecosystem model of 
one of the major fishing area in the northern 
Pacific - Bering Sea.  The co-operative project 
stipulated that with the help of the ECOPATH 
software, we should build a model of the western 
Bering Sea (WBS) in addition to one of the eastern 
Bering Sea (EBS) that had already been created by 
US scientists.  Further they intended to combine 
both models into a general model describing the 
whole Bering Sea ecosystem.  
 
Following accepted rules, we built a WBS 
ecosystem model for the 1980s.  During that 
decade TINRO-Centre carried out large-scale 
investigations of marine biota and collected 
numerous data on diverse species and groups of 
pelagic and demersal taxa.  Those data allowed 
tracing seasonal and interannual dynamics of 
species abundance, distribution, migrations, 
feeding etc.  This information became a base for 
our model.  
 
The entire Russian EEZ in the western Bering Sea 
was used as the model area.  It covers a total of 
702,200 km
2
 and encompasses a wide range of 
marine habitats including shelf, slope and deep 
basins, but it was treated as a single homogenous 
region in the model.  To describe the WBS 
ecosystem, we separated all taxa into 48 functional 
groups, composed of a single species or an 
aggregation of ecologically similar species, 
covering all trophic levels from phytoplankton to 
marine birds and mammals.  The model uses 
annual averages, i.e. all necessary data on 
abundance and feeding collected in various 
habitats were combined proportionally to the areas 
of those habitats and averaged seasonally and 
annually to provide year-round annual average 
characteristics, which were entered into the two 
main tables (basic input and diet composition).  
Commercial fishery catch was also included into 
the model.  Furthermore our model was balanced 
and we have compared the results obtained in the 
WBS and EBS (Trites et al. 1999).  Comparison 
was particularly interesting because both models 
are composed of a very similar list of functional 
groups and relate to the same time period.  Results 
are presented in Table 1. 
 
Total biomass in the WBS ecosystem was 1.75 
times higher than in the EBS, while other 
important ecological indices differed in even 
greater proportions.  For example, the sum of all 
biological production was 4 times higher, the sum 
of all consumption - 2.7 times, the sum of all flows 
into detritus - almost by order of magnitude 
greater and total system throughput - 4.5 times

higher in the WBS.  At the same time, the WBS 
ecosystem was exploited much less - gross 
efficiency was almost 20 times lower compared 
to the EBS.  Judging from these statistics in the 
1980s, the WBS ecosystem functioned much 
more intensively but less efficiently compare to 
the EBS.  However, it should be remembered 
that the EBS is generally warmer and shallower 
than the WBS, and therefore we might have 
expected the opposite situation.  What is the 
reason?  We assume that the main reason lies in 
higher average ecological characteristics, and 
first of all in the values of production/biomass 
(P/B) and consumption/biomass (Q/B) ratios, we 
have applied to describe some functional groups 
of species in the WBS ecosystem. 
 
As follows from Table 2, the annual Q/B values, 
which were defined for the WBS, are 
substantially higher in higher trophic level 
groups (pollock and herring are particularly 
indicative) and lower – in lower trophic level 
groups, compare to the EBS.  Another important 
difference is in P/B ratios of phytoplankton (see 
Table 2).  Apparently application of all these 
values caused the aforementioned differences 
between the models.  To test this assumption we 
have entered into the WBS ecosystem model 
P/B and Q/B ratios from the EBS one, keeping 
biomass and diet composition unchanged.  
Although the resulting model was found to be 
slightly unbalanced, the descriptive statistics, as 
we expected, had intermediate values between 
both original models (Table 1, last column). 
 
Thus, the values of the such important 
ecological parameters as P/B and Q/B ratios, 
entered into the model, are crucial for its  
Table 2 P/B and Q/B values applied in the WBS 
(above slash) and EBS (below slash) models.

resulted appearance, features, further simulation of 
commercial exploitation rate and final conclusion.  It 
is difficult to imagine that trophic and productive 
characteristics of the same taxa differ by several 
times in the same biogeographical area.  Of course, 
the some differences should take place due to 
various size-age composition of populations, food 
conditions, general temperature of environment, etc., 
however, we presume they are not so drastic. 
 
It is quite possible that the ECOPATH software will 
be accepted as a standard tool for modeling of 
ecosystems in diverse Pacific areas.  Pacific waters 
are inhabited by various fauna, but there are no 
doubt that almost everywhere predominating species 
and groups of species will coincide in high extent, 
especially for adjacent areas.  Thus, it would be very 
useful for future modeling efforts to compare and 
discuss methodical approaches for determining the 
most important ecological parameters of common 
species and groups in the northern Pacific.

ECOPATH is a trophic accounting model that is 
a practical way of studying the interactions of all 
species in an ecosystem.  We used ECOPATH to 
study the dynamics of the Strait of Georgia 
ecosystem (area: 6,900 km
2
), located between 
Vancouver Island and the British Columbia 
mainland.  The Strait of Georgia is probably the 
most important marine ecosystem on Canada’s west

coast, as much of the population of British 
Columbia lives within 10 km of its shores and it is 
a key rearing area for Pacific salmon, herring, and 
other species. 
 
Our ECOPATH model has 32 functional groups.  
We estimated the biomass, production/ biomass 
ratios, consumption/biomass rates, and diet 
compositions for each functional group.  We used 
a number of references and the unpublished results 
of our own studies over the past 26 years to 
estimate these data.  An important estimate for the 
lower trophic levels was the hydroacoustic 
estimate of euphausiids made in 1999 and 2000 
(Pearsall et al. 2001).  The two dominant fish 
species in the Strait of Georgia are Pacific hake 
and Pacific herring.  Reliable biomass estimates 
existed for both of these species (McFarlane et al. 
2000; Schweigert and Fort 2000).  Pacific salmon 
are both abundant as juveniles and important 
commercially, culturally, and politically.  In recent 
years, juvenile salmon have reared in the Strait of 
Georgia longer than in the past, but adult coho 
were virtually absent.  Chinook of larger sizes and 
ocean ages greater than age 0 remained in the 
Strait but their abundance was much lower in the 
late 1990s than in the 1970s and 1980s.

In this report, we model two ecosystem states:  one 
in 1998 and one in 2001.  We show that the 
increase in production that occurred in 2000 had a 
major impact on the dynamics of the trophic 
relationships in the Strait of Georgia in 2001.  The 
increase in productivity in 2000 probably resulted 
from a change in the climate and a corresponding 
change in the oceanography. 
 
The 1998 model (Table 3) assumed a biomass of 
phytoplankton of 36 t/km
2
 and a production/ 
biomass ratio of 130.  The model was balanced 
with 99.2% of the phytoplankton production being 
consumed by higher trophic levels.  On average, 
over 90% of the production of the four 
herbivorous zooplankton groups (euphausiids, P. 
minutus, N. plumchrus and other herbivorous 
zooplankton) was consumed by higher trophic 
levels.  Carnivorous zooplankton (amphipods) 
contributed 58.1% of its production to higher 
trophic levels.  The biomass of Pacific hake was 
10 t/km
2
.  The major items in the hake diet were 
euphausiids (70%) and carnivorous zooplankton 
(16%).  Diet composition for the models are 
summarized in Table 4.  Although adult hake fed 
on juvenile hake and herring in the past, we have 
not found fish remains in hake stomachs in the late 
1990s.  Pacific herring migrate out of the Strait of 
Georgia after about age 1, and return only to 
spawn in the winter in their third and subsequent 
years.  We estimated that euphausiids made up 
58% of their diet.  Euphausiids were also an 
important prey for juvenile salmon, accounting for 
22% to 30% of their diet.  Another major fish 
species in the model was spiny dogfish.  Dogfish 
are omnivorous, but grow only a few mm/year, 
thus their consumption is small relative to their 
biomass.  The model balanced for 1998 indicated 
that 75.5% of the euphausiids were consumed by 
higher trophic levels. 
 
The hydroacoustic study indicated that there was 
109.7 t/km
2
 and 227.5 t/km
2
 of euphausiids in the 
Strait of Georgia in September/October 1999 and 
2000, respectively.  The biomass estimates in 
Pearsall et al. (2001) were modified for our 
ECOPATH model to approximate our 
interpretation of their life history.  The maximum 
biomass of euphausiids in the Strait of Georgia 
occurs late in the year and the minimum biomass 
about June.  The life span exceeds one year thus 
the P/B will be lower than other groups of 
zooplankton.  Therefore, we estimated the annual 
biomass to be 80 t/km
2
 in 1998 and 160 t/km
2
 in 
2001.  A variety of scenarios would be possible to 
balance the 2001 model with the increased 
euphausiid production, but all scenarios would 
indicate a substantial increase in the biomass of a 
number of functional groups.  The addition of the 
biomass of euphausiids used in the 2001 model 
into the 1998 model resulted in 37.8% of the 
production being consumed by predators and an 
imbalance of 115.8% of the phytoplankton 
production.  Because euphausiids feed primarily 
on phytoplankton, the increase in euphausiid 
abundance most likely was associated with an 
increase primary productivity.  Such an increase 
would also benefit larval copepod survival.  We 
balanced the 2001 model by increasing the 
biomass of these and other functional groups that 
would benefit directly or indirectly from increases

groups from the 1998 model to 2001 model, scaled

in euphausiid biomass (Table 3).  We adjusted the 
biomass of species that might be directly affected 
by the increased productivity in the 2001 model 
(Table 3), but did not change the diets used in the 
1998 model.  
 
In our 2001 model, we assigned only 58.1% of the 
new euphausiid production to consumers, yet there 
were increases in biomass of 40% for herring and 
hake, 50% for shellfish, 100% for crab, chum, 
chinook and coho, 150% for miscellaneous 
demersal fish, and 267% for small pelagic fishes 
(Table 5).  It is possible that these increases might 
take longer to develop, however, the model 
increases would be indicative of the possible 
changes in biomass.  The changes in salmon 
abundance would be particularly important.  In 
another study we are testing the hypothesis that 
salmon survival or production is a function of both 
predation and summer growth.  If our hypothesis 
is correct, the improved summer growth in 2000 
will increase marine survival, and the returns of 
coho and pink salmon in 2001 will be larger than  
previous years.  We note that if the primary 
production remains at the 2000 level, there will be 
continued major changes in the ecosystem as 
higher trophic levels increase their biomass in 
response to the increases in prey.

The Strait of Georgia (SOG) ecosystem has been 
heavily exploited for the last 90 years and 
development in commercial fisheries has shifted 
the focus from top predators in the ecosystem to 
more abundant lower trophic level species 
(Wallace 1998).  This phenomenon is known as 
“fishing down food webs” (Pauly et al. 1998; 
Pauly et al. 2000).  Salmon fisheries were by far 
the most important fishery in the early years of 
fishing development, and by 1897, British 
Columbia was canning more than 1 million cases 
of salmon a year (Lichatowich 1999).  Both 
chinook and coho salmon have been heavily 
exploited in the SOG by the commercial net and 
troll fisheries, and by sports fisheries (DFO 1999a; 
DFO 1999b).  With almost all SOG coho stocks in 
jeopardy, a coastwide closure for all coho fisheries 
was implemented in 1998, with the exception of a 
sports fishery for hatchery fish at the mouth of the 
Capilano River. 
 
As fishing technologies improved, herring 
fisheries and groundfish fisheries grew rapidly in 
the 20
th
 century, with precipitous results.  By the 
early 1960s, herring stocks were being harvested 
at unsustainable rates and the fishery collapsed in 
1967 (Stocker 1993).  Since this time, however, 
herring stocks have recovered to near historically 
high levels (Schweigert et al. 1998).  Prior to 
1970, herring were mainly used for fishmeal, but 
after the collapse, a more valuable roe fishery was 
developed.  Groundfish such as lingcod and 
several rockfish species were also heavily 
exploited in the 1900s, and with the introduction 
of trawl fisheries to the SOG in 1943, exploitation 
rates rose dramatically (Cass et al. 1990; Martell 
9
  
1999).  Invertebrate fisheries have existed in the 
SOG for the last 100 years, however, until the 
1950s the f isheries were mainly focused on 
dungeness crabs and manilla clams (an exotic 
species).  Since the 1950s, there have been 
developments in shrimp fisheries, geoduck clams, 
sea urchin, sea cucumbers and octopus fisheries 
(Ketchen et al. 1983).  
 
Stock assessment reports have attributed the 
observed declines in abundance to factors other 
than overfishing.  In fact, more attention has been 
spent on trying to explain environmental processes 
that may have led to a reduction in marine survival 
rates in salmon (Beamish and Bouillon 1995), or 
changes in food availability associated with 
changes in physical properties (Robinson 1999).  
At this time, the occurrence of a “regime shift”, or 
long-term changes in primary productivity in the 
Pacific Ocean (Beamish et al. 1999), is postulated 
as the major factor leading to abundance declines 
in the SOG.  
 
An obvious, but often unresolved, issue is the role 
of trophic interactions in suppressing recruitment 
or indirectly changing natural mortality rates 
(generally assumed to be constant).  Among 
fisheries scientists and academia, there is a 
growing consensus that we can no longer forge 
ahead and exploit a resource without considering 
trophic interactions at an ecosystem scale (Walters 
et al. 1997).  The majority of data available, 
however, are usually restricted to species of 
commercial importance.  In the SOG alone for 
example, there are more than 250 different species 
of fish, but fisheries statistics are collected for less 
than 50 species coast-wide (vertebrate and 
invertebrate combined).  Moreover, we have even 
less knowledge about the specific interactions 
among members in an ecosystem, a problem we 
are now forced to face.  
 
The objective of this paper is to carry out a 
retrospective analysis of the Strait of Georgia 
ecosystem and use data from single species stock-
assessment programs to determine if the observed 
data suggest that changes in primary productivity 
have occurred in the last 50 years.  We address 
this issue by comparing reconstructed ecosystems 
from 1950 to 1998 using two scenarios:  1) assume  
that there has been no changes in relative primary 
productivity, and 2) estimate relative primary 
productivity regimes that would better explain the 
observed data.  Finally, we compare the estimated 
primary productivity regimes to environmental 
correlates, specifically wind speed squared (a 
measure of sheer stress), and the Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation.  
 
Predicting biomass dynamics using ECOPATH 
with ECOSIM  
 
The trophic mass-balance model used in 
ECOPATH uses a set of simultaneous linear 
equations that assumes the production of group i is 
equal to the consumption of group i by all 
predators j, plus export and non-predation losses 
(including fisheries landings) of group i, over a 
specified time period.  This function is generally 
expressed as:  
Equation 1 
( ) ( )
 
=
    + =    
n
j
ji j j i i i i
DC B Q B Y EE B P B

Where B
i
 is the biomass of group i, (P/B)
i
 is the 
production biomass ratio of group i, (Q/B)
j
 is the 
consumption biomass ratio of group j (predators of 
group i), and DCji is the average diet fraction of 
prey i for group j.  EE
i
 is the ecotrophic efficiency, 
or the fraction of production that is consumed 
within the system, including fisheries yields (Y
i
).  
 
The following differential equation is used to 
predict dynamic changes in biomass and is 
dependent on whether the group is a primary 
producer or a consumer in the system:

a function used to predict consumption of group i 
by predator j, conditional on the interactions and 
abundance of the two groups (see Eqn. 4).  For 
primary producers, a simple saturating function is 
used to predict biomass production:

Predicting consumption in ECOSIM stems from 
the "Foraging Arena" concepts proposed by 
Walters and Juanes (I993).  At equilibrium the 
consumption of i by j is:

In Equation 4, a

is the mass action consumption 
rate, and vij describes the exchange rate process 
from "available" to "unavailable" behavioural 
states.  Using ECOPATH estimates ( Q
ij
, B
i
, and 
B
j
) the mass action consumption rate can be 
estimated by re-arranging Equation 4.  Therefore, 
the only user specified parameter is the beha-
vioural exchange rate parameter (v
ij
).  Equation 4 
is structured such that consumption is dependent 
on both predator and prey biomass.  If predator 
biomass is low then consumption reduces to a 
mass-action flow, and if predator biomass is high 
then consumption approaches a "donor control" 
rate represented by the behavioural exchange rate 
process v
ij
 (Walters et al. 1997; Walters et al. 
2000).  As v

 approaches 1, the rate of predation is 
dependent on the biomass of the predator (top-
down control), and as v approaches 0, prey spend a 
larger fraction of their time budget hiding from 
predators and predation is limited by biomass of 
prey in the system (bottom-up or donor control).  
 
ECOSIM uses a Marquardt n on-linear search 
algorithm with a trust region modification for each 
of the Marquardt steps to estimate relative forcing 
inputs and v
ij
.  To evaluate the differences between 
predicted and observed data, ECOSIM uses a log- 
least-squares criterion, which we refer to as SS fit 
to the data.  We allow the search routine to 
estimate v
ij
 parameters and, when we assume there 
have been changes in relative primary production 
over time, a relative forcing time series that is 
applied to the primary production.  Estimating v
ij
 
is equivalent to estimating observation errors in a 
single species stock assessment approach, and the 
relative changes in primary production is 
equivalent to estimating process errors.  
 
Changes in primary productivity  
 
The observed time series data, shown as circles in 
Figures 1 and 2, are better explained when we 
assume that there have been substantial changes in 
primary productivity over the 50-year time series 
(also see Table 6).  Under the constant primary 
production hypothesis the log sum of squares fit to 
the data was 115.87, and under a fluctuating 
primary production hypothesis the fit to the data 
was 75.24 (roughly a 35% reduction).  The 
probability of this reduction in the SS by chance 
alone is 0.006, i.e. the observed data do suggest a 
change in primary productivity must have 
occurred.  Under the constant primary production 
hypothesis, model biomass predictions generally 
agree with the observed data.  However, it fails to 
capture recent observations in harbour seal 
abundance and southern r esident killer whales.  
Marine survival rates for coho and chinook salmon 
have also declined through the 1990s, and a more 
parsimonious explanation is that there has been a 
severe decline in primary production starting 
around 1990 (Fig. 2).  
 
The estimated changes in relative primary 
productivity are shown in Figure 3, and we 
compared this estimated index with other 
environmental correlates that are linked to primary 
production.  We were unable to find any 
significant correlations between primary 
production and Fraser River discharge, wind 
speed, sea surface temperature, upwelling, or the 
Pacific Decadal Oscillation.  However the overall 
downward trend in primary production is very 
similar to the downward trend observed in average 
wind speed squared (Fig. 4).  The square of the 
wind speed is a measure of sheer stress between 
air and the water surface, which results in vertical 
mixing of the water column allowing entrainment 
of nutrients used in photosynthesis (Blackett, 
1993).  A similar downward trend is also observed 
in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDO).

Discussion  
 
The observed time series for 11 of the 15 data 
types (Table 6) suggest that large fluctuations in 
primary production must have occurred in the 
Strait of Georgia over the last 50 years.  Declines 
in average wind speed, and the Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation index also support the decline in 
primary productivity hypothesis.  Ideally, this 
study should include direct estimates of primary 
productivity over the entire Strait of Georgia;  
unfortunately, we were unable to find these data, if 
they exist.  Nevertheless, it is clear, from our 
understanding of ecosystem dynamics that 
observed declines are better explained by 
assuming primary productivity has declined. 
 
The fisheries stock assessment data used here were 
not made for the purposes of studying the role of 
climate effects on ecosystem dynamics.  It is 
important to note that these data are limited in use, 
as predictors of relative changes in primary 
productivity.  Untangling the complicated trophic 
interactions, climate effects, and mortality patterns 
in ecosystem analysis is difficult;  and direct 
observations on each of these processes will be 
required to improve our understanding of 
ecosystem dynamics.  Many physical oceano-
graphic studies have been completed, and 
currently in progress, in the Strait of Georgia.  
Incorporating these data into the analysis will 
greatly improve our understanding of ecosystem 
responses to c hanging physical environments.  
Probably one of the more difficult tasks, however, 
will be to study small-scale processes of changing 
trophic interactions that are related to spatial and 
temporal abundance of animals.  Predator-prey 
interactions play a key role in determining optimal 
exploitation rates in that we need to understand 
how reducing the abundance of one species effects 
mortality rates for other species in an ecosystem 
with variable productivity.

Introduction 
 
The Bohai Sea (Fig. 5) is a semi-closed 
continental water of China, which is nearly 
encircled by land only with a mouth about 90 km 
at the eastern apex that connects it to the Yellow 
Sea.  The Bohai Sea is located in the temperate 
water region between 37°00’~ 41°00’N with 
77,000 km
2
 in area and the average depth of  
18.7 m and the maximum water depth of 70 m.  
Water temperature changes a lot resulting from the 
impact of the land climate.  The highest SST is 
26~30°C in September and the lowest one is 
1.2~4°C in February.  Much of the fresh waters 
run into the Bohai Sea from about 20 rivers, for 
example the Yellow River, Liao River, Raoyang 
River, Ling River, Luan River, and other rivers.  
The runoff of fresh water was 31.4 billion m
3
 per 
year in the 1970s and half of it came from the 
Yellow River.  The sea is an ocean space with 
distinct productivity, strong fishing activity and 
complicated relationship of food web, and is also 
polluted by industry and living sewage recently.

The Bohai Sea ecosystem depends on the amount 
of input of solar energy and the organisms 
imported from several rivers.  NO

are basic nutrients supporting the primary 
productivity in the Bohai Sea.  The production of 
organic carbon of the sea is 112 gC/m
2
/year.  The 
productivity, like other marine ecosystem, is 
characterized by seasonal and spatial variability 
with high levels in spring and fall and in the 
southern part of the sea, but not much change 
between years.  In the Bohai Sea, the dominant 
small zooplankton are neritic brackishwater 
species, such as Sagitta crassa Tokioka, 
Labidocera euchaeta Giesbrecht and Centropages 
mcmurrichi Willey.  The Bohai Sea small 
zooplankton biomass has two seasonal peaks, in 
June and September, and the biomass of other 
individual species has only one seasonal peak (Bai 
et al. 1991).  The fishing effort in the sea has been 
increasing more and more since 1962, and has led 
to a significant variation in the abundance and 
distribution of the most species in the area.  The 
intensive fishing resulted in the decrease of 
biomass of demersal species with high economic 
value (large predatory species), such as Pseudo-
sciaena polyactis and Trichiurus haumela, while 
harvesting more of smaller pelagic species, such as 
Setipinna taty and Engraulis japonicus.  
 
Methodology and the ECOPATH model 
 
The first ECOPATH model was developed to 
describe a coral reef ecosystem (Polovina 1984) 
and was further developed by Christensen and 
Pauly (1992) at ICLARM to make it widely 
available as a well-documented software running 
on a microcomputer.  Lately the ECOPATH model 
has been integrated with ECOSIM for d ynamic 
simulation modeling based on a mass-balanced 
model by Walter, Christensen and Pauly (1997).  
In an ECOPATH model it is assumed that the 
ecosystem modeled is in steady state for each of 
the living groups, which implies that input equals 
output, i.e. Q = P + R + U, where Q is 
consumption, P - production, R - respiration, and 
U - unassimilated food.  The above equation can 
be structured around a system of linear equations 
for expressing mass-balance with the simplest 
form.  It can be expressed for an arbitrary time 
period and for each element i of an ecosystem by 
Equation 1 (see Martell et al. this report).  It is the 
simultaneous linear equations used in ECOPATH 
to state that the production and consumption are 
balance within an ecosystem.  
 
The ECOPATH model allows rapid construction 
and verification of mass-balance model of 
ecosystem.  The mass-balance model not only 
verifies the previously published biomass 
estimates, but also identifies the biomass required 
for assessment of marine carrying capacity.  
Constructing an ECOPATH model includes the 
following steps: 
 
1. Identification of the area and period for which 
the ecosystem model will be constructed;  
2. Definition of all functional groups (boxes), 
from primary producers to top predators, in 
the ecosystem t o be included for the 
thermodynamic balance;  
3. Setting parameters of production/biomass ratio 
(P/B), consumption/biomass ratio (Q/B), 
biomass (B) and ecotrophic efficiency (EE) 
for each function group, but only three of them 
are necessary as the basic input parameters in 
the model, and also entry of the catches to 
every fishing species;  
4. Entry of a diet consumption matrix (DC) 
expressing the diet fraction of predator/prey 
relationship in the model;  
5. Modify the entries of P/B, Q/B, EE or the 
biomass, to balance the ECOPATH model 
(repeating steps (3) and (4) above) until the 
mass input equals output for each box.  
17
  
Structure of the Bohai Sea ECOPATH model 
 
The resources composition in the Bohai Sea 
changed a lot along with the fishing effort increase 
to multi-species fish communities after 1962.  The 
CPUE (catch per horse power) was 7.61 tons in 
1962, but it went down to 0.88 ton in 1983.  The 
traditional species fished in the area, such as small 
yellow croaker, slender shad, cutlasfish, were high 
valuable in the market, but the biomass of them 
declined then.  The small pelagic fish and small 
crustacean species appeared more in the landings 
and fluctuated much more annually.  The highest 
annual landing of Acetes (a sergestid shrimp) can 
be 100 hundred metric tons  
(1.3 t/km
2
) in the sea.  The highest catch of 
jellyfish reached 280 hundred tons during the 
1970s.  This reflects a gradual transition in catch 
from long-lived, high trophic level piscivorous 
bottom species toward short-lived, low trophic 
level invertebrates and planktivorous pelagic 
species.  The Bohai Sea is an example of an 
overfished marine ecosystem leading to smaller, 
high-turn-over species.  It is a peculiarity of the 
sea that small pelagic fish and jellyfish replace 
large table fish in an over-exploited ecosystem 
(Pitcher 1998).  
 
The mass-balance model of the Bohai Sea is aimed 
at constructing a quantitative description of trophic 
structure and the relationship among the different 
groups in the whole Bohai Sea.  The model is 
based on the data of the Bohai Sea ecosystem 
survey project completed during April 1982 to 
May 1983.  The project collected the data monthly 
by the bottom trawling and mainly made 
assessment of the commercial important species 
and their biological characteristics study.  As this 
is the first ECOPATH model of the Bohai Sea, it 
only presents a preliminary revelation of the 
trophic structure and flow in the sea between 
different functional groups.  The functional groups 
in the model covered the main trophic flows 
among the living marine species and detritus, but 
the group definition is very rough because of the 
limited type of survey data available in the region.  
The functional group determination is based on the 
species distribution in the water and their feeding 
behaviour after inspecting the stomach contents of 
54 species from 1863 samples.  Considering the  
limited data and no existing mass-balance model 
in the Bohai Sea, the model only has 13 function 
groups.   
 
One primary producer of phytoplankton was 
identified.  Zooplankton was split into two groups, 
microzooplankton and macrozooplankton.  The 
former includes small herbivorous and carnivorous 
zooplankton and the latter mainly consists of 
jellyfish and Acetes.  Benthic invertebrates were 
divided into small mollusca, large mollusca, small 
crustacean and large crustacean, most species of 
which were commercial harvest in the sea but the 
landing data were not readily available.  There 
were no biomass data for some species in the 
small invertebrate groups so their biomass were 
estimated by the model using the fixed ecotrophic 
efficiency (EE=0.95).  Biomass for the two large 
groups were obtained by summing up the biomass 
data from the survey.  Five fish function groups 
were identified in the model on the basis of 31 fish 
species which hold about 90% of total biomass for 
the fish community in the Bohai Sea.  The 
herbivorous feeders group includes mainly Mugil 
cephalus and Liza haematocheila.  The other four 
groups were small pelagic fish, demersal fish, 
benthic feeders and top pelagic feeders, which 
were important commercial fishing targets.  The 
details of 13 function groups (box) in the Bohai 
Sea ECOPATH model are summarized in Table 7.  
Many species are included in one box of the model 
so it is hard to find P/B and Q/B from one species 
for the whole group.  The P/B and Q/B parameters 
were based on the parameters from similar 
function groups in the models of the Strait of 
Georgia (Dalsgaard 1998), the Brunei Darussalam, 
South China Sea (Silvestre 1993) and the Georges 
Bank (Sissenwine 1984).  
 
The basic parameters of biomass (wet weight 
t/km

), P/B, Q/B, EE and harvest for the 1982-83 
ECOPATH model of the Bohai Sea ecosystem are 
presented in Table 8.  Detritus is estimated from 
primary production of carbon by equation A5 of 
the empirical relationship method (Pauly, D., 
M.L.Soriano-Bartz et al. 1993).  Phytoplankton

Results and discussion 
 
To balance import to and export out from every 
box, the EE values are leading check parameters 
for equilibration of a model when running the 
ECOPATH 3.0 software.  The EE value should be 
between 0 and 1.  Here, a value of 0 indicates that 
the group is not consumed by any other groups in 
the system, nor is it exported.  Conversely, a value 
near or equal to 1 indicates that the group is being 
heavily preyed or fished, leaving no individuals to 
die of old age.  Some of the original biomass 
inputs from the Bohai Sea trawling survey in 
1982-83 are considered too low, and as aresult  
equilibrium cannot be reached in the model with 
the high value of EE.  This is because the survey 
data connecting commercial species from bottom 
trawling and the function groups in the model 
cover a wide range of living marine species.  
According to the results obtained by different 
resource assessment methods (Fig. 7.5; Laevatsu  
and Alverson 1996), biomass value estimated by 
bottom trawling survey is much lower than the 
ones from other stock assessment methods.  It is 
necessary to modify the biomass data to 
equilibrate the model.  The biomass of small 
pelagic fish group is estimated from 1.2 to  
2.14 ton/km
2
, and the benthic fish group from 0.32 
to 0.68 ton/km
2
.  
 
The model estimated the biomass density of 
commercially utilized species to be at  
12.33 ton/km
2
 and the density of all fish species at 
only 4.4 ton/km
2
.  A flow chart showing trophic 
interactions and energy flow in the Bohai Sea is 
presented in Figure 6.  It shows the estimated 
trophic level of the 13 functional groups and the 
relative amounts of energy that flow in and out of 
each box.  The trophic flow to detritus, respiration 
and catch are also represented.  Two food paths, a 
plankton path and a benthic path, are shown, 
which are the food webs characteristic of the 
Bohai Sea.  The lower trophic level groups have a 
strong influence on the Bohai Sea ecosystem.  
High fishing effort leads to decline of high value 
living marine resources, which can be seen by the 
negative impacts to the ecosystem from fishery.  
 
No common information is available for the 
biomass comparison with other ECOPATH 
models in the Bohai Sea.  The values in our model 
are low compared with densities in other 
ecosystems, such as the Caribbean coral reef and

the southern B.C. shelf, but it is higher than that 
reported in other models of the Bohai Sea.  The 
output from the ECOPATH model looks more 
reasonable.  We conclude that the total biomass of 
commercially fished species in the sea is 950,000 t 
and 338,000 t are fish species of value. 
 
Ecosystem statistic and trophic flow of the Bohai 
Sea e cosystem model (1982-1983) could be 
considered as reasonable value, but some problem 
concerned with the input data have to be taken into 
account.  First the function groups should be split 
further to estimate more precisely input 
parameters, like P/B and Q/B, for each box.  Then 
the diet data for some species is also needed to be 
modified slightly to let all EEs be reasonable.  
Thirdly, it is better to consider the habitat for 
different species in the ECOPATH model 
developed in the future.

Current Japanese programs on ecosystem studies 
in the oceanic waters of the northern North Pacific 
have been carried out mainly by Hokkaido 
University (HU- Faculty of Fisheries) and 
Fisheries Research Institutes belonging to the 
Fisheries Agency of Japan (FAJ).  The Western 
Subarctic Gyre (WSAG) and the Kuroshio-
Oyashio Transition Zone (TZ) are of major 
interests to Japan because of the fisheries 
resources available there.  For example, Wada et 
al. (1998) adapted a trophodynamics model to 
sardine and walleye pollock populations in the 
Oyashio Current Region using STELLA-II 
software.  Modeling of the entire ecosystem for 
WSAG and TZ, however, has not been 
established. 
21
  
Aydin (this workshop) raised four discussion 
points on WSAG ecosystem study:  (1) the 
appropriate boundaries and species groupings of 
the model;  (2) the issues involves with scaling 
seasonal models of lower trophic levels up to a 
model with an annual time scale;  (3) sources for 
data and parameterization methods, and (4) the 
appropriate methods for the inclusion of highly 
migratory species, specifically Pacific salmon 
(Oncorhynchus spp.) and marine mammals.  These 
are also true for TZ.  
 
In this report I will briefly introduce ecosystem 
study projects, monitoring activities and major 
published reports relevant to this workshop.  
BIOCOSMOS results are summarized in Oozeki 
(2000). 
 
Recent ecosystem projects 
 
HUBEC (Hokkaido University SuBarctic Eco-
system dynamics and Climate) is a research 
program organized by oceanographers and 
fisheries scientists in the Faculty of Fisheries to 
address the question of how climate change and 
dynamics may affect the abundance and 
production of animals in the sea.  
 
ORI-GLOBEC i s a project established by the 
Ocean Research Institute, University of Tokyo, to 
study response of plankton, micronekton and fish 
population to climate regime-shift in the Kuroshio-
Oyashio region.  Progress of ORI-GLOBEC and 
HUBEC by 1998 was reported in T erasaki et al. 
(1999), where ecosystem-physical modeling of a 
warm-core ring was presented. 
 
VENFISH (Variation of the oceanic ENvironment 
and FISH populations in the northwestern Pacific) 
is a comprehensive study supported by the Tohoku 
National Fisheries Research Institute (TNFRI-
FAJ) and Hokkaido National Fisheries Research 
Institute (HNFRI-FAJ), etc. in 1997-2002.  Study 
components are: 
- Development of a forecasting method for the 
variation of phytoplankton biomass; 
- Development of a forecasting method for the 
variation of zooplankton biomass; 
- Observation and modelling of the variation of 
resources abundance of saury and Alaska 
pollock; 
- Clarification of response of saury and pollock 
to the oceanic environmental variation; and  
- Development of the forecasting ecosystem 
model for saury and Alaska pollock 
abundance (including population dynamics 
and trophodynamics models).  
 
Only bottom-up processes from physical forcing to 
saury and pollock populations are considered.  
Predations on saury and pollock and competition 
among each trophic level will be treated in the 
next stage of the project.  
 
High Trophic Ecosystem (1999-200?) is a 
consecutive project of VENFISH organized by the 
National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries 
(NRIFSF- FAJ).  Study components: 
- Monitoring distribution and abundance of 
species with driftnet and midwater trawl; 
- Stomach content analysis of small cetaceans, 
sea birds, albacore, skipjack, sharks and 
squids; 
- Trophic level analysis with stable isotope 
techniques; 
- Energetic demand estimation of large 
predators; 
- Input of results on dynamics of lower trophic 
level ecosystem from VENFISH project; and 
- Ecosystem modeling.  
 
Monitoring data 
 
- HU:  Oceanography and driftnet surveys along 
155  E, 170  E, 175  E, etc., from 1979-present; 
- TNFRI:  Oceanography, primary production, 
zooplankton, driftnet surveys, etc.; 
- HNFRI:  Oceanography and driftnet surveys 
along 165  E; 
- Other routine observations by FAJ, prefectural 
governments, etc. 
 
Discussion points 
 
Boundaries and species groupings of the model   
 
From oceanographic features, WSAG and TZ have 
been treated separately.  From biological point of 
view, however, the two ecosystems are 
interdependent.  Small pelagics, squids and 
predatory animals (sharks, salmons, tunas, birds, 
marine mammals) migrate across the Subarctic 
22
  
Front (the boundary between WSAG and TZ) 
although this front acts as a barrier or a selective 
filter for some species or species size.  Some 
species such as Pacific salmon migrate in an east-
west direction, e.g. between WSAG and the 
Okhotsk Sea.  Minor species components with 
similar ecological features may be grouped.  On 
the contrary, size (or biologically) segregated 
migration as in Pacific pomfret may be treated 
separately. 
 
Scaling seasonal models of lower trophic levels 
up to a model with an annual time scale 
 
Because of seasonality in primary production and 
migrations of zooplankton, nekton, mammals and 
seabirds, models must be constructed season by 
season at a first step, then to be combined to 
include interannual variability.  A general problem 
is the availability of data other than in summer.  
Seasonal and vertical variations in zooplankton 
biomass have been monitored in Kuroshio, 
Oyashio and TZ.  Modeling effort of Oyashio 
region including the effect o f the vertical 
migration of Calanus/Neocalanus spp. has been 
continued by the MODEL Task Team and 
Hokkaido University's group (see PICES Sci. 
Report 15: 1-77, 137-139; Kishi et al. 2000). 
 
Sources for data and parameterization methods  
 
Primary and secondary productions have been 
studied primarily by HUBEC and VENFISH.  
Biomass estimations are obtained from the routine 
stock assessment for commercially important 
species (sardine, mackerel, common squid, etc.).  
For other species, driftnet and midwater trawl 
surveys would be useful.  Russian surveys are of 
course important in this aspect (e.g., Shuntov et al. 
1996).  Estimations for production and 
consumption rates need to be thoroughly 
examined, since transfer efficiencies from primary 
production to zooplankton and from zooplankton 
to fishes in Oyashio were different from those in 
California Current (Wada et al. 1998). 
 
Methods for the inclusion of highly migratory 
species 
 
This is the notorious problem that needs 
monitoring for all seasons.  Monitoring activities 
have been concentrated in summer season, 
although some information on seasonal migration 
of predatory animals is available.

BASS Workshop recommendations 
 
As the PICES CCCC Program enters its synthesis 
phase, modelling will play a more prominent role 
in CCCC activity.  Participants recommended the 
BASS and MODEL Task Teams to convene a 
joint workshop to examine the feasibility of using 
the ECOPATH/ ECOSYSTEM modelling 
approach as a means to organize our 
understanding of the marine ecosystems of the 
subarctic gyres.  Specific objectives include to:   
(a) synthesize all trophic level data in a common 
format; (b) examine trophic relations in both gyres 
using ECOPATH/ ECOSIM/ECOSPAC; and  
(c) examine methods of incorporating the PICES 
NEMURO lower trophic level model into the 
analysis. 
 
Participants recommended that collaboration and 
synthesis of the data into a common format take 
place prior to the workshop.  G. McFarlane will 
co-ordinate this issue for North America and A. 
Krovnin and A. Yatsu for Asia.  K. Aydin will 
synthesize the data into the ECOPATH format.  If 
possible, the workshop should be held in 
conjunction with the PICES Census of Marine 
Life Workshop to be held March 7 -9, 2001, in 
Honolulu.  Locating the venue in Hawaii at this 
time is seen as a cost-effective way to involve 
workshop participants from both sides of the 
Pacific and would lead to a more balanced 
scientific representation from the nations of the 
North Pacific.

MODEL WORKSHOP ON STRATEGIES FOR COUPLING HIGHER AND 
LOWER TROPHIC LEVEL MARINE ECOSYSTEM MODELS  
(Co-convenors:  Michio J. Kishi and Bernard A. Megrey) 
 
 
Introduction 
 
A variety of models have been used to describe 
lower trophic level (LTL) and higher trophic 
level (HTL) components of North Pacific 
ecosystems.  In order to facilitate comparisons 
of model results among areas, the goal of the 
MODEL Task Team for the next few years is to 
adapt a prototype LTL model developed at the 
workshop held in Nemuro, J apan, in January 
2000, and to apply it to basin and regional scale 
ecosystems in the North Pacific.  These 
activities will require coordination with BASS, 
REX, and MONITOR Task Teams.  The 
Nemuro Workshop focused on the development 
and parameterization of a LTL model to PICES 
regional ecosystems, and began discussions 
about ways to link HTL models to LTL models.  
The follow-up Hakodate Workshop described in 
this report was intended to extend the initial 
discussion that began in Nemuro, and to develop 
viable strategies for this important linkage. 
 
The following summary of the Task Team 
discussions from the Hakodate Workshop 
outlines some important factors which determine 
how LTL production flows to HTL predators, 
and how much of this energy is transformed into 
HTL production.  Many of the factors and 
processes mentioned below should be included, 
either explicitly or implicitly, in an HTL model. 
The output of the coupled model should also be 
analyzed to ensure that it is able to reproduce 
reasonable production/biomass and 
consumption/biomass ratios, and ecotrophic 
efficiencies.  
 
Goals and objectives of the workshop 
 
The goals of the workshop were to: 
1. Collectively identify viable strategies for 
linking the NEMURO LTL (Fig. 1) model to 
HTL models of the North Pacific ecosystem 
at the regional and basin scales of interest to 
BASS and REX. 
2. Develop strategies for integrating different 
time/space scales and size spectra from various 
models. 
3. Find areas of mutual interest where MODEL 
could interact with other CCCC Task Teams, 
especially REX and BASS. 
4. Achieve broad synthesis through modeling 
which will lead to global understanding of the 
response of marine ecosystems to global climate 
change.  
5. Discuss strategies for simulating variability in 
populations of fish and zooplankton, to evaluate 
the cause of this variability, and to identify 
approaches that will ultimately permit the 
development of a predictive capability. 
6. Discuss how to best link LTL and HTL marine 
ecosystem models, regional circulation models, 
and how to best incorporate these unified models 
into JGOFS models and the CCCC Program. 
 
Participants, venue and schedule 
 
The workshop was held at the Future University in 
Hakodate, Japan, during the PICES Ninth Annual 
Meeting in October 2000.  Participants (MODEL 
Endnote 1) consisted of LTL and HTL modelers and 
individuals with knowledge about key data sets in 
each selected region and activity within that region. 
 
The workshop schedule (MODEL Endnote 2) 
consisted of a half-day CCCC plenary session held 
jointly with other CCCC Task Teams.  This was 
followed by a full-day MODEL Workshop.  The 
final afternoon consisted of a wrap-up CCCC 
plenary session.  During PICES X there were several 
impromptu meetings between MODEL and BASS, 
and between MODEL and REX. 
 
The following section contains abstracts, extended 
abstracts, and fully prepared reports presented at the 
workshop.  The reports are organized by author 
according to the workshop schedule.  The author in 
bold font made the presentation.  Model versions 
referenced in these reports are described in Megrey 
et al. (2000).

Strategies for coupling upper and lower trophic levels in ecosystem models 
 
Kenneth A. Rose

University, Baton Rouge, LA  70803, U.S.A.  E-mail: karose@lsu.edu  
 
Ecological issues have become complex, with 
increasing emphasis being placed on ecosystem 
considerations.  Anthropogenic stresses on the 
ecosystem, such as global climate change, require 
a whole-system approach to adequately account 
for both the direct and indirect effects.  Yet, 
despite great effort, we have had great difficulty in 
quantitatively understanding the relationships 
between habitat and fish population dynamics 
(Rose 2000).  Previous efforts of the PICES 
MODEL Task Team have involved development 
of a lower trophic level simulation model 
(NEMURO) that tracks nitrogen, phytoplankton, 
and zooplankton (NPZ).  In my presentation, I 
focus on the issues and strategies related to 
coupling upper trophic levels to lower trophic 
models, such as the NEMURO NPZ model.  I also 
present three examples that illustrate these issues 
and strategies.  I conclude with some general 
comments related to coupling upper and trophic 
levels in dynamic models. 
 
There are five general issues that must be 
considered when coupling upper and lower trophic 
levels.  These issues are:  (1) spatial and temporal 
scales, (2) biological scale, (3) site-specificity, (4) 
feedbacks, and (5) specification of the question.  
Good models are properly scaled to address the 
question of interest.   
 
The temporal scale is defined by the time step of 
the model and the duration of the simulations.  The 
spatial scale is defined by the grain (finest grid 
size) and extent (geographic area being modeled).  
The processes controlling nitrogen, phytoplankton 
and zooplankton operate on different time and 
space scales than those important to fish, birds and 
mammals. Most everyone would agree that a 90-
second timestep on cm-scale spatial grid is not 
appropriate to simulate long-term fish population 
dynamics.  The optimal temporal and spatial scales 
in a model are determined by the properties of the 
important processes, the availability of data, and 
the questions to be addressed.  Unfortunately, 
there are no general rules for knowing whether the 
optimal scales are being represented in a particular 
model.   
 
The second issue of specifying the biological scale 
is related to determining the optimal temporal and 
spatial scales.  When modeling upper trophic 
levels, a fundamental decision is whether the 
question can be addressed with partial or full life 
cycle predictions.  Partial life cycle predictions 
might be survival and growth during a particular 
life stage or period of time.  Full life cycle 
simulations allow for multiple generations to be 
simulated and for long-term predictions.  
Developing models that permit full life cycle 
simulations is a much more difficult and labor-
intensive effort.  New issues, such as long-term 
population stability, become important.  
Population models that do not include negative 
feedbacks (density-dependence) have only two 
possible solutions, either extinction or populations 
going to infinity.  Neither of these ultimate 
solutions is realistic for full life cycle situations; 
yet, the most difficult aspect of full life cycle 
modeling is specifying the density-dependent 
(negative feedback) relationships. 
 
The third issue of site-specificity also greatly 
influences the effort involved with model 
development and validation, and the appropriate 
way to interpret predictions.  Models can be 
developed that attempt to simulate the population 
in an actual geographic area for specific time 
periods.  Such models require extensive data to 
account for the nuances of the particular 
population and location and are more involved to 
develop, but result in higher confidence in site-
specific predictions and results that are easy to 
relate to resource management.  The alternative 
approach is to develop models that do not claim to 
simulate a particular location and time period, but 
rather, simulate a taxa like the species of interest 
in environments representative of the area of 
interest.  Such models are usually easier to 
27
configure because data can be borrowed from 
related species and from nearby or similar 
geographic areas.  The disadvantages to such 
representative models are that we have low 
confidence in their site-specific predictions and 
their interpretation focuses on patterns rather than 
magnitude.  The relative merits of the site-specific 
versus representative models depend on the 
resolution required to address the question of 
interest.  
 
The fourth issue is how to represent feedbacks in 
coupled lower and upper trophic level models. 
Model coupling is simplified if the effects between 
trophic levels can be assumed to be bottom-up.  
This allows the lower trophic model to be run 
separately from the upper trophic level model.  If 
the dynamics of the upper trophic levels affect the 
dynamics of the lower trophic levels, then 
simultaneous solution of both levels are required.  
Another type of important feedback is the negative 
feedbacks that act to stabilize population 
dynamics.  Accurate prediction of the dynamics of 
upper trophic levels requires understanding of the 
density-dependent feedbacks that operate to keep 
populations within certain numerical bounds.  
Representing these feedbacks in upper trophic 
models can be difficult and, at times, 
controversial.  The shape of spawner-recruit 
curves assumed in fish population dynamics 
models is a good example.  Such feedbacks 
determine the response of populations and 
communities to stressors, and ultimately determine 
the resilience of the population and the magnitude 
of harvest that is sustainable.   
 
The fifth, and perhaps most important, issue 
related to coupling upper and trophic level models 
is the specification of the question to be addressed.  
The question of interest must be clearly specified, 
preferably stated as an hypothesis or family of 
hypotheses.  Otherwise, one is assured of 
developing an improperly scaled model with the 
wrong structure, inputs, and outputs.  Treating the 
modeling effort as an experiment with hypotheses 
and experimental design can avoid many of the 
problems with inappropriate models.  A saying 
with some merit is that “there are no bad models, 
just bad model applications”. 
 
Two commonly used modeling approaches for 
upper trophic levels are matrix projection 
modeling and individual-based modeling.  Matrix 
projection modeling has the advantages of using 
readily available data on growth, mortality, and 
reproduction, and well-known mathematical 
solution (eigenvalue analysis) methods.  The 
disadvantages to the matrix approach are that 
adding stochasticity and density-dependence often 
limits the ability for mathematical analysis;  
density-dependence is represented with aggregate, 
difficult-to-measure, relationships;  all individuals 
in a life stage are treated as identical;  and only a 
few discrete spatial regions can be represented.  
 
Two general approaches to individual-based 
modeling are the p-state and i-state methods.  The 
p-state approach follows probability distributions 
of individuals with partial differential equations.  
The i-state approach simulates individuals as 
discrete units, following thousands of such 
individuals in simulations.  DeAngelis et al. 
(1993) showed that both approaches yield very 
similar predictions when formulated from the 
same information.  The p-state approach is 
mathematically elegant, while the i-state approach 
is more flexible allowing for greater biological 
realism.  I focus on the i-state approach in this 
presentation.  The i-state approach is conceptually 
appealing.  The individual is the evolutionary unit 
in nature, and summing over individuals yields 
population level behavior.  The i-state individual-
based approach addresses some of the 
disadvantages of the matrix projection approach. 
Representation of episodic effects, local 
interactions, and movement of individuals is 
relatively easy.  Also, the difficult-to-specify 
density-dependent relation-ships inherent in the 
matrix approach become emergent properties of 
the rules imposed on individuals.  The 
disadvantages to t he i-state individual-based 
approach are that it is data hungry, 
computationally intensive, sometimes difficult to 
validate at the individual level, and due to lack of 
data, individuals are often assigned the same 
average values. 
 
I use three examples of upper trophic levels being 
coupled to lower trophic level or physical models 
28
 to illustrate these five issues, and to also illustrate 
the use of matrix and individual-based modeling.  
These examples are:  walleye pollock, striped 
bass, and northern anchovy.  Hinckley (1999) 
embedded individual fish as particles into a 3 -D 
hydrodynamics model, and then allowed the 
individuals to encounter prey via a coupled NPZ 
model.  The model was site-specific, focused on 
young-of-the-year (YOY) life stages, and was 
designed to understand recruitment variability.  
Model results illustrated the benefits of a 
Lagrangian approach for modeling of upper 
trophic levels in spatially-explicit grids.  
 
The second example is a model of striped bass 
population dynamics (Rose et al. in prep.), and 
illustrates a hard-coupling between upper and 
lower trophic levels.  YOY striped bass were 
simulated using a detailed, individual-based 
model.  This process-based YOY model was 
coupled to an age-structured matrix projection 
model for ages 1 to 17 to permit multigenerational 
simulations.  For the YOY model, San Francisco 
Bay was divided in four coarse spatial boxes.  A 
spatially-detailed hydrodynamics model was used 
to simulate particle transport for typical low flow 
and average flow years.  Movement of individuals 
among the four coarse spatial boxes in the YOY 
model was based on probability transitions 
estimated from the hydrodynamic simulations.  
Predicted spatial distributions of YOY in the four 
boxes agreed with observed spatial distributions.  
A set of 30-year simulations showed that no single 
factor could explain the decline in striped bass, but 
that the combined effects of the multiple factors 
resulted in a realistic rate of population decline. 
One of the most controversial aspects of the entire 
modeling exercise was the density-dependent 
survival from age-1 to age-3 assumed in the adult 
matrix model.   
 
The third example is an individual-based, full life 
cycle model of northern anchovy in the California 
Bight (Wang et al. 1998).  This example illustrates 
a soft-coupling.  Individuals were followed from  
birth to death in a two box model.  Movement was 
simulated using a set of simple rules that were 
qualitatively based on measured distributions and 
transport considerations.  Typical zooplankton 
densities for normal and ENSO years were 
determined from long-term monitoring data, but 
could also be thought of spatially-averaged output 
of a NPZ model.  Climate change was simulated 
by increasing the intensity assumed for ENSO 
conditions, by increasing the frequency of ENSO 
years, and both combined.  While predicted 
northern anchovy population abundance in 200-
year simulations was generally lower under more 
intense and more frequent ENSO conditions, there 
were also periods of 10 or more years in which 
predicted abundances were similar to baseline 
conditions. 
 
In summary, I presented a brief (and biased) view 
of how to couple upper trophic levels to lower 
trophic levels in ecosystem models.  The lessons 
learned were: 
(1) Highly site-specific models allow easy 
interpretation of predictions but require a large 
effort and have questionable generality;  
(2) Avoid reliance on intuition, as responses are 
often not proportional to the magnitude of 
changes imposed and interactive effects 
among multiple, time-varying factors are the 
norm rather than the exception; 
(3) Maintain a keen awareness of the capabilities 
of the model to ensure the formulations are 
appropriate for addressing the specific 
questions of interest,  
(4) Be flexible and willing to use a suite of 
models, with each tailored to a particular 
problem and realize that the obvious way to 
couple trophic levels may not be the optimal 
approach; and  
(5) Clearly define the question of interest as a 
hypothesis and then tailor the model or models 
to the particular problem.

An ecosystem model with 11 compartments was 
developed in order to describe primary and 
secondary production in the Northern Pacific 
Ocean.  This model was made by the request of 
the PICES/GLOBEC CCCC Program.  Model 
equations describe the interactions of nitrate, 
ammonium, silicate, two phytoplankton size 
fractions (tentatively, these are diatoms and 
flagellates), three zooplankton size f ractions 
(tentatively, microzooplankton, copepods, and 
predatory zooplankton), as well as nutrient 
kinetics.  Formulations for the biological processes 
are based primarily upon process equations 
presented in Kawamiya et al. (1995).  A 1 -D 
physical-biological coupled model including a 
mixed layer closure model (1-D NPZ model) is 
used to simulate time dependent features of the 
ecosystem at three locations:  Ocean Station P, 
Station A7 of the Akkeshi line off Hokkaido 
Island, Japan, and a region in the southeast Bering 
Sea.  Time series of biological dynamics from the 
biological model as well as time-depth 
distributions of nutrient and plankton obtained 
from the 1-D NPZ model for three regions in the 
North Pacific are compared.  This presentation 
summarized the work and accomplishments of the 
PICES CCCC/MODEL Task Team Workshop, 
held in Nemuro, Japan, in January 2000 (see 
PICES Scientific Report No. 15, and Megrey et al. 
2000, and for details).

A sensitivity analysis was performed on the 
NEMURO/FORTRAN Box model using the 
Monte Carlo analysis.  The ecological parts of the 
model were run to calculate the nitrogen-based 
biomass of each compartment until steady state 
solutions were obtained.  Values of each 
compartment and ecological parameters were 
stored to be used as the baseline values around 
which random perturbations were generated and 
put into the Monte Carlo error analysis.  A Monte 
Carlo error analysis with 600 individual 
calculations was made with input parameters and 
initial values perturbed independently over 
random error distribution with limits of – 10% of 
base line values.  Principal component analysis 
(PCA) was used to reduce the 600 sets of output of 
biological parameters and initial values.  The PCA 
indicated four factors, which together, explained 
22% of the variance in the data space.  The first 
principal component, which was clearly related to 
photosynthesis of PL, accounted for 10% of the 
data space variance and included the variables

To the physical forcing and the ways of improvements in the NEMURO Model

Supposing we know the behavior of the biological 
part of an ecosystem with stationary physical 
conditions, the problem is to define the main 
physical parameters and the ways of their 
influence on the ecosystem behavior.  In the 
NEMURO model, the main physical parameter 
entering almost all equations is temperature, which 
is calculated with the use of a mixed layer model.  
Many observations (examples for the northwestern 
Pacific and Okhotsk Sea are given) show that 
small-scale fluctuations of the temperature 
gradient vertical structure (fine-structure FS and 
microstructure MS) are important as for vertical 
distribution of plankton, and for its integral 
biomass.  Mechanisms of FS and MS influence on 
phytoplankton and zooplankton production may be 
different, but as a first approximation we propose 
to use an additional coefficient proportional to rms 
of the vertical temperature fluctuations in the layer 
studied (0-330 m) in all temperature-dependent 
terms.  The values of rms can easily be obtained 
from observations (XBT, for example), and a 
model is proposed that helps to evaluate them. 
 
Some additional improvements in the model are 
discussed, including:  1) time-lag in the 
dependence between zooplankton and 
phytoplankton concentrations;  2) adjusting 
averaging scales to the intrinsic (biological) and 
forced (physical) time scales;  3) interdependence 
between input parameters; and  4) criteria for 
comparisons between models and observations.

Discussion and extensions to the NEMURO/ 
MATLAB Box model at the Hakodate Workshop 
and the months that followed included three main 
components:  development of diagnostics and 
comparison to observed and literature values, 
effect of vertical migration by large zooplankton, 
and the inclusion of an approximation to a 
microbial loop formulation.  Results of these 
experiments, which are summarized below, are 
presented for the Station P location. 
 
Diagnostics of NEMURO at Station P 
 
To quantify the results of the NEMURO/ 
MATLAB Box model at Station P, we developed 
a series of diagnostic measures including daily 
production/biomass ratios (P/B) for phytoplankton 
and zooplankton, and food consumption/biomass 
ratios (C/B) for small, large and predatory 
zooplankton and the ecotrophic efficiency (EE), a 
measure of how much primary production 
transfers to the zooplankton species.  A brief 
description of the procedures and results is given 
below. 
 
32
1. Output for the 8
th
 year from the model was 
post-processed to calculate a number of 
variables:  daily P/B ratios for phytoplankton 
and zooplankton, and C/B ratios for small, 
large and predatory zooplankton and the 
ecotrophic efficiency. 
2. The P/B, C/B and EE are calculated as 
follows:  
 
NPPS=GppPSn-ResPSn – Net Primary Production 
for small phytoplankton 
NPPL=GppPLn-ResPLn – Net Primary Production 
for large phytoplankton 
NCZS=GraPS2ZSn+GraPL2ZSn – Net

NCZL=GraPS2ZLn+GraPL2ZLn+GraZS2ZLn – 
Net Consumption for large zooplankton 
NCZP=GraPL2ZPn+GraZS2ZPn+GraZL2ZPn – 
Net Consumption for predatory zooplankton 
TNPP=NPPS+NPPL – Total Net Primary 
Production 
TGPP=GraPS2ZSn+GraPS2ZLn+GraPL2ZLn+Gr
aPL2ZPn – Total Gross Primary Production 
NPZS=NCZS-ExcZSn-EgeZSn – Net Production 
for small zooplankton 
NPZL=NCZL-ExcZLn-EgeZLn – Net Production

for predatory zooplankton 
P2BPS=NPPS/PS – Production/Biomass Ratio for 
small phytoplankton 
P2BPL=NPPL/PL – Production/Biomass Ratio for 
large phytoplankton 
P2BZS=NPZS/ZS – Production/Biomass Ratio for 
small zooplankton 
P2BZL=NPZL/ZL – Production/Biomass Ratio for 
large zooplankton 
P2BZP=NPZP/ZP – Production/Biomass Ratio for 
predatory zooplankton 
C2BZS=NCZS/ZS – Consumption/Biomass Ratio 
for small zooplankton 
C2BZL=NCZL/ZL – Consumption/Biomass Ratio 
for large zooplankton

Results  
 
Simulation results (Fig. 4) show that there is a 
small spring bloom of large phytoplankton (PL) 
(which peaked at a level of about 3· the average 
biomass around time year 8.2 (or day 73 or March 
13)).  This bloom is an artifact of the “box” nature 
of the model.  The addition of a process to 
“activate” grazing by the large zooplankton (ZL) 
when the large phytoplankton begin to bloom is 
discussed later in this report. 
 
Figure 5 shows the P/B, C/B, and P/C (production/ 
consumption) ratios.  Additional model result 
summaries are presented in Tables 1 and 2 from 
the model output for year 8.  In this case, the P/B 
ratio= specific growth rate (daily), the P/C ratio= 
growth efficiency, and B= annual mean biomass 
(mmolN/l). 
 
Recently, several methods have been used to 
estimate the annual primary production (Annual 
PP) around Station P.  The bold values in Table 3 
are based on direct measurements and therefore 
are probably more accurate.  Calculated values 
from NEMURO are given in Tables 4 and 5 using 
conversion factors from Table 6.  A comparison of 
model output and diagnostics to field 
measurements can be summarized as follows:  
 
1. The C/B and P/C ratios are reasonable (Tables 
1 and 2). 
2. The annual primary production in the model 
(128 gC/m
2
/yr) is only 8% lower than the best 
current estimate (Table 3 - 140 gC/m
2
/yr).  
3. The average chlorophyll concentration at 
Station P in the model (Table 5 - 0.36 mg/m
3
 
is only 10% lower than the long-term value 
(0.4 mg/m
3
) measured by Wong et al. (1995) 
(Table 7). 
4. An approximate f-ratio can be estimated from 
the annual productivity of PL / Total primary 
production (Table 7).  This estimate assumes 
that the production of the large phytoplankton 
(PL) is primarily fuelled by “new” nitrogen 
(NO
3
) with “f-ratio”=  29.5/128 = 0.23.  Wong 
et al. (1995) estimated an f-ratio of 0.25.  So 
the agreement is good.

Inclusion of microbial loop:  sensitivity studies 
to climate change 
 
Under certain scenarios, it is possible that changes 
in climate could lead to differences in the amount 
of primary production passing through the 
microbial loop.  For example, an increase in 
stratification – due to increased freshwater inputs 
or higher temperatures – may reduce the nutrient 
entrainment to the euphotic zone, shifting the 
pelagic foodweb toward smaller species.  We have 
modified the NEMURO/MATLAB Box model to 
include an approximation to a microbial loop as 
described in Megrey et al. (2000) and its possible 
effects on higher trophic levels.  Using the same 
variable names as in Megrey et al. (2000), our 
simplified paramaterization of the microbial food 
web, which is included in the variable BetaZS is: 
  
BetaZS = 0.3 
(1+ PhySn/(PhySn+PhyLn))
 
 
This means that the gross growth efficiency of the 
small zooplankton can vary between 0.3 and 0.09, 
and will probably average about 0.16 over the year 
at Station P.  For the base model run, a constant 
BetaZS=0.3 was used.  We found (Fig. 6) that the 
inclusion of a microbial loop has only a small 
impact on the standing stocks of small and large 
zooplankton, but reduces predatory zooplankton 
standing stocks by about one half.  These 
differences are due to the decreased net trophic 
efficiency of the system when a large portion of 
the primary production passes through a microbial 
community before entering the zooplankton 
community.  With the decreased predatory 
zooplankton biomass, there is only half as much 
biomass potentially available for fisheries 
production. 
 
Vertical migration by large zooplankton: 
sensitivity studies 
 
At Station P, during spring, the large zooplankton 
component (ZP) should be dominated by 
Calanus/Neocalanus spp.  These species exhibit a 
strong ontogenetic migration: they arrive in the 
upper layers in early spring at C1 (and older) 
copepodites and feed for about 60 days until 
descending from the surface layer as C5's.  
Therefore, the model population should increase in

(green line) the inclusion of a microbial loop.

biomass in the early spring independent of food 
availability/grazing.  Later in the year, the 
population should decrease by some amount to 
simulate the descent of the C5's.  To explore this 
effect, we modified the model as follows.  Over a 
certain time (between days-of-the-year 30 and 60), 
we increased the large zooplankton population 
five-fold.  The increased population would be 
available to graze on the diatoms.  Other dynamics 
occur as normal.  After 60 more days, we begin 
decreasing the large zooplankton population by 
one half over 30 days (between days 120 and 150).  
Again, other dynamics are unchanged.  Figure 7 
shows results with and without migration.  In the 
case of migration, the diatom (PL-large 
phytoplankton) bloom is much reduced.  The 
estimates of Ecotropic Efficiency (not shown) are 
not significantly affected.

The model presented is based on the NEMURO / 
1-D Yamanaka Model described in Megrey et al. 
(2000), but it is extended to 15 c ompartments 
including silica and carbon cycles.  The extended 
model is applied to Station A7 offshore of 
Hokkaido Island (41°30' N, 145°30' E), in the 
northwestern Pacific, which is one of the stations 
along the A -line where the Hokkaido National 
Fisheries Research Institute has been conducting 
surveys 5 -7 times each year from 1987 to 2000.  
The model successfully simulates the observed 
spring diatom blooms and large annual variation 
of chlorophyll-a.  A comparison between cases 
with/without silicate limitation shows that the 
silicate limitation causes the decease of primary 
production by diatoms in the summer and the 
transition of phytoplankton species between 
diatoms and others. 
 
Model description 
 
The model and boundary conditions in this study 
are exactly the same as the NEMURO/1-D 
Yamanaka model or that in Kishi et al. (2001), 
except the original 11 compartments describing 
the biological processes where changed into 15.  
Figure 8 shows interactions among the 15 com-
partments in the biological processes.  We divide 
phytoplankton and zooplankton into two cate-
gories, respectively:  large phytoplankton (PL) and 
small phytoplankton (PS), large zooplankton (ZL) 
and small zooplankton (ZS).  ZL represents cope-
pods with seasonal vertical migration, i.e., coming 
up to upper layer in spring, becoming adults and 
grazing on other plankton, and then returning to 
the deep layer in fall.  This treatment is similar to 
that in Kishi et al. (2001).  ZS represents the 
others.  PL is diatoms which make siliceous shells 
from silicate in the water.  Therefore, the nutrient 
limitations for photosynthesis by PL are not only 
nitrogen but also silicate in the water, which are 
not taken into account in Kishi et al. (2001).  PS 
represents the other phytoplankton, non-diatom 
and flagellate.  Some of PS and ZS are regarded as 
coccolith and foraminifera, which have calcarious 
shells, respectively.  Predatory zooplankton (ZP) 
represents something like euphausiids grazing on 
other plankton, which connect the lower trophic 
level food chain to the higher trophic levels such 
as fishes, following discussions at the PICES 
MODEL Workshop in Nemuro.  The model also 
has three nutrients, nitrate (NO
3
), ammonium 
(NH
4
), and silicate (Si(OH)
4
), particulate organic 
matter (POM), dissolved organic matter (DOM), 
Opal, calcium carbonate (CaCO
3
).  Calcium (Ca) 
in the sea water is taken into account, in order to 
calculate total alkalinity (TAlk) using the 
concentrations of NO
3
, Si(OH)
4
, Ca following the 
TAlk definition.  Total carbon (TCO
2
) is obtained 
with assumption that all plankton have the same 
C/N stoichiometry as classical Redfield ratio, 
106/16.

carbon dioxide (pCO
2
) in the ocean surface is 
obtained from the TAlk and TCO
2
 under the 
chemical equilibrium at each time step.  The silica 
cycle coupled with the nitrogen cycle accounted 
for in the photosynthesis process by PL affects the 
ecosystem dynamics.  On the other hand, carbon 
and calcium cycles do not affect ecosystem 
dynamics because carbon and calcium are plentiful 
in the water and do not limit primary production.  
Parameters used in this study are shown in  
Table 8.  Most parameters are based on Kishi et al. 
(2001) and NEMURO, although some parameters,

, K
SiL
, V

, are tuned to 
reproduce the observed data, as discussed in 
parameter studies (Yoshie et al. in preparation). 
 
We use the coupled ecosystem model mentioned 
above with physical model, vertical one-
dimensional model with mixed layer closure 
scheme, used in Kishi et al. (2001).  Boundary 
conditions, SST, SSS, wind stress, solar radiation, 
are the same as described in Kishi et al. (2001).  
Time integration is performed for ten years using 
data of 1991, and after that actual forcing from 
1991 to 1996.

Results 
 
Figure 9 shows vertical distributions of vertical 
diffusive coefficient A
HV
, nitrate concentration, 
and chlorophyll-a concentration from 1991 to 
1996.  Areas of high A
HV
 represent the mixed 
layer with seasonal changes.  Deep convections in 
winter penetrated deeper than 160 m depths in 
1992 and 1996.  The nitrate-laden waters of almost 
20 x10
-6
 mol/l are supplied to the ocean surface 
associated with winter convections and cause a 
strong spring bloom by diatoms after winter.  In 
1992, the maximum value of chlorophyll-a 
concentration reaches 4.6x10
-6
 mol/l, which 
compares well with observed values during the 
spring bloom period.  On the other hand, in 1993 
or 1994, winter convections penetrated to around 
70 m and the spring bloom was very weak.  In 
summer, nutrients in the surface are exhausted and 
the maximum layer of chlorophyll-a concentration 
is located around 30 m.  The model successfully 
reproduces the observed seasonal variations of 
nitrate, silicate, and chlorophyll-a, although the 
model cannot reproduce effects of horizontal 
advection/diffusion due to meso-scale eddy effects 
on nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations.

fall.  The spring bloom reaches 600 to 800 m g 
C/m
2
day in 1992, 1995, and 1996, which 
compares well with observed levels.  The spring 
bloom of diatoms has large annual variation, and 
the spring bloom in 1991 and 1994 is weak.  The 
cessation of the spring bloom of diatoms is 
associated with increasing grazing pressure by 
copepods, although both nitrate and silicate in the 
surface water still remain over 10 x10
-6
 mol/l at 
the end of bloom.  After the diatom bloom, 
primary production by PS increases, an often 
observed transition of species from diatoms t o 
flagellates, and nitrate in the surface water is 
exhausted at the end of summer.  Many frequent 
downward spikes of primary production's lines in 
Figure 10a can be seen.  These represent decreases 
of primary production due to decreasing solar 
radiation on rainy or cloudy days.  The partial 
pressure of carbon dioxide has a maximum 
associated with winter convection, rapidly 
decreases due to the spring bloom, and is kept 
almost constant, canceling out the temperature 
effect and biological production effect. 
 
A dark thick line in Figure 10c shows Si/N ratio 
obtained from downward fluxes of opal and POM 
at depth of 100 m.  The water supplied from the 
deep layer has a Si/N ratio of 1.7.  Si/N ratios have 
large seasonal variations:  about 3.0 in winter and 
spring, and about 1.0 in summer, although the total 
time average of the Si/N ratio in total settling 
particles is equal to 1.7.  It looks inconsistent that 
a Si/N ratio of 3.0 is greater than the stoichiometry 
42
of diatoms, i.e., Si/N ratio of 2.0.  However, when 
copepods (ZL) and euphausiids (ZP) graze on 
diatoms, shells of diatoms are quickly discarded as 
settling opal and exported out of the euphotic 
layer.  On the other hand, the soft tissue of diatoms 
become some of their bodies or DOM and nitrogen 
is recycled in the euphotic layer.  Therefore, Si/N 
ratio takes a higher value than the stoichiometry of 
diatoms. 
 
A light thin line in Figure 10c shows f-ratio, ratio 
of nitrate uptake to nitrogen uptake in the 
photosynthetic processes of PL and PS.  The  
f-ratio is highest, 0.8, at the start of spring bloom, 
which is due to nitrate supply from the deep water 
associated with the winter deep convection, then 
decreases rapidly due to increase of ammonium 
and a decrease of nitrate as a result of the spring 
bloom, and takes a minimum of 0.3 (see f-ratio in 
1996).  In the other season, the f -ratio is kept 
almost constant at about 0.5.  The e-ratio (a thin 
solid line), which is the ratio of downward flux 
due to POM to primary production, is smaller than 
0.3, except for spikes due to small primary 
productions on bad weather days.  The e -ratio is 
smaller by the factor of 2 -3 than f -ratio, because 
POM is dissolved in the euphotic layer, and 
because organic matters directly returns to 
ammonium and nitrate by extracellular excretion 
and is quickly recycled.  The rain ratio (a broken 
line in Fig. 10c), ratio of calcium carbonate flux to 
POC's at 100 m depths, is 0.01 to 0.11, which has 
the maximum in summer and minimum during the 
spring bloom. 
 
 
A new approach to the modeling of marine ecosystems

The existing approaches to mathematical modeling 
of marine ecosystems are undergoing a crisis.  
This situation was evident to some extent in all 
reports concerning descriptions of the ecosystem 
function.  At the MODEL Workshop in Nemuro 
this was also evident:  it has left unsolved 
problems such as the limitation by additional 
environmental factors into the primary link (except 
light, nitrogen, and silicon), in particular, by Fe; as 
well as including the microbial link into the 
ecosystem.  The problem of including higher 
trophic levels into the ecosystem has not been 
solved.  The practical workers have proposed new 
questions such as splitting some trophic links into 
age groups, the behavior of which differs greatly. 
 
The MODEL Task Team has done a lot of work.  
It has developed the Prototype Lower Trophic 
Level Ecosystem Model (NEMURO, Eslinger et 
al. 2000), which is a generalization of practically 
all of the most important developments on 
modeling marine ecosystems available in the 
published literature (Fasham et al. 1995; 
Kawamiya et al. 1997; Oguz et al. 1999).  Due to  
this, the NEMURO model possesses both 
advantages and deficiencies typical of such 
models.  That is why, in our opinion, the 
NEMURO model has significant difficulties in 
solving the problems described above. 
 
The main problem in modern modeling of marine 
ecosystems is related to the fact that the approach 
to modeling is based on empirical models of each 
biological process, and, consequently, the 
ecosystem as a whole.  The existing models do not 
involve the mechanisms of the biological 
processes. 
 
From a strictly mathematical point of view, it is 
not important by which functions, empirical or 
those based on mechanism, to describe different 
processes.  It is important that these functions 
reflect the real processes quite well.  Still it is 
known that the empirical approaches are not only 
limited in application, but they do not make it 
possible to understand real processes, and, 
consequently, they do not possess the perspectives 
for the development of modeling. 
 
43
The 20
th
 century, especially the second half, is 
marked by the greatest discoveries in biophysics, 
biochemistry and physiology of organisms in 
general, and plants in particular.  For example, in 
the field of primary production, being discovered 
were the carbon Calvin’s cycle, two photosystems 
of photosynthesis, the water splitting system, 
photosynthetic and respiration electron-transport 
chains, cyclic and non-cyclic photo-
phosphorylation, and photorespiration, (Edwards 
and Walker 1983; Goodwin and Mercer 1983).  
The peculiarities of carbon and nitrogen, 
phosphorus metabolism, and their interrelation 
were investigated; and the role of macro- and 
microelements in formation of primary production 
has been stated.  An important achievement is 
establishing the fact that the biological processes 
present themselves as the chains and nets of 
coupling cyclic (in particular, enzymatic) 
interactions (Goodwin and Mercer 1983).  These 
non-disputable facts are not presented in the most 
recent models of marine ecosystems. 
 
The difficulties of analysis of mass fluxes for 
modeling of ecosystems are conditioned by non-
homogeneity of the processes and structures 
forming the hierarchy of the ecosystem levels, 
starting from a cell up to the complicated 
assemblages of populations.  With this, the 
necessity arises to couple the phenomena different 
in nature and temporal scales - physical-chemical 
ones, biochemical, physiological, and those of 
population.  A unique approach to the description 
of such sort of systems is possible if the system is 
considered as the interaction of mass fluxes which 
is in accordance with the common laws of nature 
for the whole system. 
 
Below an attempt is made to develop an approach 
to modeling marine ecosystems, starting from 
descriptions of separate biological processes and 
ending with the ecosystem as a whole.  
 
Primary link of ecosystem 
 
Primary production, i.e. the creation of organic 
matter, is central in the turnover of substances of 
the ecosystem.  This link predetermines the 
volume of fluxes through all the other links.  
Understanding the processes of primary 
production and their adequate quantitative 
description is a determining one for the flow 
description in the ecosystem as a whole. 
 
The processes of matter transformation into 
various trophic links of the ecosystem are based on 
general biochemical (enzymatic) mechanisms.  
Along with this, the primary production link 
differs from heterotrophic links, at least, in two 
ways:  (1) the process rate depends on several 
substrate factors simultaneously, and (2) one of 
“substrates” of the process is the light energy.  
Matter flux through the heterotrophic link depends 
just on one substrate factor - food concentration, 
where the biogenous elements are relatively 
balanced. 
 
Just these two circumstances create serious 
difficulties with quantitative modeling of the 
dependence of the primary production rate on the 
environmental factors which have not been coped 
with yet. 
 
Photosynthesis scheme 
 
Photosynthesis is the basis of primary production.  
A large number of generalized schemes of the 
process can be found in scientific literature 
(Edwards and Walker 1983; Goodwin and Mercer 
1983).  Figure 11 presents a simplified variant of 
“Z-scheme” of photosynthesis after Goodwin and 
Mercer (1983) in accordance with the modern 
notions.  Even such a simplified scheme is a chain 
of 13 consecutive coupled cyclical reactions. 
 
Two of them are cyclical transformations of 
oxidation-reduction of reaction centers PSII and 
PSI, coupled by an electron-transport chain 
consisting of five electron carriers.  PSII receives 
an electron from water via a water-splitting system 
(Z) (cycle 1), and via an electron transport chain 
(cycles 3 -7) transfers it to PSI.  In its turn, PSI 
transfers an electron to acceptor (X), which via the 
carrier (cycle 10) reduces NADP to NADH
2
 (cycle 
11).  NADH
2
 is involved in poli-enzyme pentose-
phosphate reduction cycle (Calvin’s cycle), where 
CO
2
 reduces to hydrocarbon (cycles 11-13). 
 
An approach for the mathematical description of 
such kind of chains of cyclic coupled processes 
has been developed earlier (Zvalinsky and Litvin 
1986).  It has been shown that a linear chain of

We studied the kinetic characteristics of the chain

we do not consider oxidizing-reducing trans-
formations of the components of the reaction 
chain, but just describe the dependence of the 
process rate on the substrates concentration, then 
the conceptual m odel and the corresponding 
mathematical model can be significantly 
simplified without considerable damage to the 
quality of the quantitative description.  A five-
cycle scheme presents a conceptual model of a 
four-substrate process (Fig. 11b).  Mathematically, 
this model is described by:

 is the total equivalent 
resistance of all cyclical reactions beyond the 
bounds of substrate cycles, and the rest are as in 
Equation 1.  We see that in a simplified variant the 
dependence of rate on any substrate is described 
similarly, with no regard to its location in the 
chain of reactions (Fig. 11a):  mathematically, the 
equation is relatively symmetric to any substrate 
(Eqn. 2). 
 
In the case when the concentration of one of 
substrates is large (H

ﬁ 0) and the limiting one is one of the photo-
systems, the conceptual model of the process

The relationships (4) and (5) are non-rectangular

It is seen from Equation 7 that in coordinates 
{[I]*(1 - V)/V} and V, that the whole hyperbolic 
family, rectangular and non-rectangular ones, 
possesses the form of a straight line with slope 
equal to -r
PP
.  With this, the continuation of the 
straight line cuts off the segment V
0
 at the X-axis 
which is numerically equal to the reverse value of 
resistance V
0 
= 1/r
PP
, and at the Y -axis, the 
segment is equal to a substrate constant K
I
  
(Fig. 12).  The straight line parallel to the abscissa 
corresponds to the rectangular hyperbola of 
Michaelis-Menten.  Analysis of experimental 
kinetic curves in these coordinates enables us to 
ascertain the character of dependence and to solve 
the problem of adequacy of the proposed models 
to the real biological processes.  Moreover, such 
analysis allows to determine the values of 
parameters K
I
 and r
PP
 by modeling the process as a 
two-cyclical scheme (Fig. 11d-e, Fig. 12). 
 
It is noteworthy that the maximal simplification of 
the reaction chain in Figure 11a is possible up to a 
one-substrate two-cyclic coupled reaction  
(Fig. 11e).  In such ‘minimal’ two-cyclic model, 
the substrate incorporation and substrate 
processing take place in different systems of 
cyclical reactions.  Further simplification up to 
one-cycle model is quite coarse and non-adequate, 
and it is possible in the only particular case when

Comparison to the experiment   
 
We have carried out a great number of 
experiments to measure the light and CO
2
 
dependence of the rate of marine alga 
photosynthesis.  The data testify that the real 
dependencies are described by the equation of 
non-rectangular hyperbola (4) and (5) with a 
sufficiently high accuracy (Zvalinsky and Litvin 
1988a, 1988b).  The values r
PP
 @ 0.95, and r
I
 @ r
C
 @ 
0.05 have been determined experimentally both 
for the light and CO
2
 curves of photosynthesis.  
Non-rectangular hyperbola with such parameters 
is the most similar to the hyperbolic tangent (Platt 
et al. 1977).  It means that the rate of substrate 
incorporation (may) as a rule exceed the rate of 
substrate processing by not less than ~20 times.  
Also, the tests have shown high accuracy in 
describing photosynthesis rate by Equation 3 using 
two factors at a time (light intensity and CO
2
 
concentration, Fig. 12).

Michaelis-Menten equation or non-rectangular 
hyperbola   
 
In the NEMURO model, the dependence of the 
primary production rate on the concentration of 
nutrients is described by equations of rectangular 
hyperbola (Eqns. 1 and 2 in Eslinger et al. 2000).  
As it was noted above, all substrates are 
incorporated into the reaction chain via the 
corresponding enzymes (components, Fig. 11a) in 
the same manner, so conceptually and 
mathematically the process dependence on 
substrates should be described by a similar type of 
functions, non-rectangular hyperbola (Eqns. 2 and 
5).  Usage of Michaelis-Menten equation is not 
correct and can lead to quite low accuracy and 
non-adequacy of the description.

Inhibition or preference?   
 
In the NEMURO model the competitive ratios of 
ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen 
consumption and also the grazing rates of large-
phytoplankton and small-zooplankton to predator-
zooplankton are described by introducing the 
inhibition function (Eqns. 1 -2 and 13-14 in 
Eslinger et al. 2000).  With this, inhibition takes 
place at quite a low c oncentration of substrate 
(food) comparable to the value of the Michaelis 
constant.  Still, in physiology it is considered that 
inhibition takes place only at the highest values of 
substrate concentrations (many times exceeding 
the Michaelis constant, Edwards and Walker 
1983).  At low values, it is more expedient to 
speak not about the inhibition, but about the 
‘preference’.  So, for two forms of nitrogen the 
equation of non-rectangular hyperbola (4) looks 
like:

Analysis has shown that the equation with 
inhibition (Eqns. 1-2 in Eslinger et al. 2000) gives 
values that are significantly lower t han those 
calculated from to the equation of non-rectangular 
hyperbola with the light preference (Eqn. 8,  
Fig. 13).  This distinction is especially high in the 
region of low and moderate concentrations (up to 
60%), which is the most widespread situation i n 
nature.  As far as the tests confirm the adequacy of 
description of kinetics of the production process 
by the equation of non-rectangular hyperbola, the 
usage of Equation 8 with ‘preference’, from our 
point of view, should describe the process with 
higher precision than the function with inhibition. 
 
General model of primary production   
 
By analogy with the scheme of photosynthesis 
(Fig. 11a), a conceptual model of primary 
production of any complexity, incorporating any 
quantity of substrates (light, nutrients) can be 
made.  The model can be maximally simplified 
with the aim of describing the primary production 
rate in relation to the environmental factors.  For 
four factors - light intensity and concentration of 
main nutrients (two forms of nitrogen, phosphorus, 
and silicon) the model is given in Figure 11f. 
 
The production rate P will be described by a 
system of two equations:

 and 
r
S
 - relative coupling resistance of corresponding 
substrate cyclical process with the extra-substrate 
cyclic processes;  parameter r
PP
 is the relative 
resistance of an assemblage of the extra-substrate 
reactions. 
 
If the factor is not limiting (for instance, silicates;  
S ﬁ ¥, V/S ﬁ 0), then the denominator of the 
corresponding term (Eqn. 9) turns into 1.0 and this 
term can be incorporated into the last member of 
the right part.  Equation 9 is transformed into a 
three-substrate one with r
PP
’ = (r
PP
+ r
S
).  Similarly, 
it can be simplified until the level of two- and one-
substrate equation (Eqns. 3 and 4).  One of the 
terms of Equation 9 can be replaced by the other 
one, or a term can be included with the other 
limiting factor (for example, CO
2
 or iron). 
 
Thus, a system of equations (Eqn. 9) involves 
practically all possible variants of models for the 
primary production rate.  This model, in our 
opinion, possesses a series of advantages 
compared to models published elsewher, as well as 
to NEMURO (Eqns. 1-2 in Eslinger et al. 2000).  
First of all, and this is the most important thing, 
the model has been developed on the basis of 
modern notions of the mechanism of the primary 
50
production process.  It includes parameters with 
clear biological meaning, and has quite a simple 
mathematical presentation.  The model adequately 
describes the interrelationship of the factors, 
including competitive ones, the change of 
limitation from one factor to another without any 
additional conditions.  The model can be naturally 
simplified or extended, with regard to the needs of 
the experiment or new knowledge (for instance, 
incorporation of limitation by iron or some other 
elements).  It is naturally incorporated into the 
ecosystem model. 
 
Photo-inhibition and photo-adaptation   
 
The NEMURO model considers that the rate of 
primary production is inhibited by high light 
intensity (Steele 1962; Eqns. 1-2 in Eslinger et al. 
2000).  In plant physiology, it is usually assumed 
that instant light-saturation curves are measured in 
such a way that during the period of measurements 
the parameters of the production system do not 
change (i.e., when the processes of the light 
adaptation or inhibition do not manifest 
themselves).  Just for this case, the model of 
primary production has been obtained.  If a plant 
cell is in the light for a long time then the cell 
changes its parameters according to this light 
intensity, and an adaptation takes place.  Our 
approach considers this process and allows a light 
curve of any form (Zvalinsky and Litvin 1991). 
 
Heterotrophic links 
 
Microbial link 
 
Incorporation and metabolism of organic and 
mineral matters in a microbial cell is analogous to 
similar processes in a plant cell.  That is why our 
one-, two-, and more-substrate models (Eqns. 1-9) 
can also be used to describe even bacterial cell 
growth rates. 
 
Heterotrophic links of LTL 
 
Grazing is also a chain of coupled cyclical 
processes:  periodic food capture and the stomach 
filling in with its subsequent clearing due to the 
polyenzymatic food processing (Fasham 1995).  
Food processing needs one more substrate - 
oxygen.  Consequently, in the simplest case 
grazing can be presented by a two-substrate (food 
and oxygen) three-cycle model (Fig. 11c, Eqn. 3) 
or as a one-substrate two-cycle model with the 
dependence on food concentration (the process is 
not limited by oxygen) (Fig. 11e, Eqn. 6b).  
 
The grazing rate G for any trophic level and for 
any number of food types Fn with different 
preferences can be described by non-rectangular 
hyperbola:

‘preference’ factor.  Values of r
G
 and r
HP
 are the 
parameters of the non-rectangular hyperbola.  
Values of r
G
 and r
HP
 reflect the resistances of 
capture and processing, respectively.  The analysis 
of experimental data show that the ingestion rate 
of Calanus sinicus in relation to microplankton 
food supply describes well by Equation 10 with 
r
HP
 = 0.98 and r
G
 = 0.02 (Fig. 14). 
 
As the rate of food capture exceeds by many times 
the rate of its processing, then, as in case of 
primary production r
HP
 >> r
G
 (r
G
 » 0.02 - 0.05 and 
r

 » 0.95 – 0.98).  Non-rectangular hyperbola 
with such parameters is very similar to the 
hyperbolic tangent, i.e. it has longer initial 
segment and reaches the saturation sooner as 
compared to the exponent (Platt et al. 1977).  As 
with the case of several forms of nitrogen, using 
the current grazing function in NEMURO to 
describe grazing in the presence of several kinds 
of food is not sufficiently grounded (Eqns. 13-14 
in Eslinger et al. 2000).  It is difficult to imagine a 
mechanism of such ‘inhibition’, especially, if we 
take into account that it persists at low food 
concentration.  Non-rectangular hyperbola (Eqn. 
10) with different ‘preference’ to different kinds of 
food is closer to the real processes.

Higher trophic levels   
 
Grazing in the HTL and LTL do not differ 
considerably.  HTL animals must first capture then 
process the food (polycyclical polyenzymatic food 
processing).  Dependence of the HTL grazing rate 
in relation to the food supply can be described by 
the same function as for the LTL (Eqn. 10). 
 
Inputs and outputs of different trophic links 
 
The models described above refer to the input 
fluxes of different trophic links.  Besides the input 
fluxes there are several output fluxes in each link.  
Figure 15a presents a primary link with 1 input 
flux (incorporating inorganic matter C
0
 in the 
primary link) and 5 types of output fluxes:  
biosynthesis respiration, excretion, maintenance 
respiration expenses of phytoplankton biomass c
1
, 
mortality, and phytoplankton grazing to the next 
trophic link. 
 
Figure 15b presents fluxes for the secondary link - 
an input flux (grazing rate of phytomass to 
herbivore) and 5 output fluxes:  biosynthesis 
respiration, egestion, maintenance respiration 
expenses of herbivore biomass c
2
, mortality, and 
herbivorous zooplankton grazing to next trophic 
link.  Unlike in the NEMURO model, respiration 
in each line is divided into two parts - biosynthesis 
respiration and maintenance respiration.  They 
differ in the following.  Biosynthesis respiration 
occurs at the expense of the eaten food and is 
proportional to the biomass of this food, when 
there is no food, this type of respiration is absent.  
Maintenance respiration takes place at the expense 
of the individual’s biomass and does not depend 
on the volume of food eaten.  This type of 
respiration predetermines the threshold of an 
organism’s existence:  if the volume of food eaten 
does not compensate the expenses of maintenance 
respiration, the organism dies (Edwards and 
Walker 1983).  Just the maintenance respiration of 
the phytoplankton predetermines the boundary of 
the photic layer. 
 
Ecosystem modeling 
 
Conceptual model of any complicity ecosystem 
can be constructed by the consecutive and parallel 
linking of its different compartments (Fig. 15) 
with each other in accordance with direction of 
matter flows. 
 
Figure 16 presents one version of this type of 
model consisting of six compartments.  Four of 
these compartments are the biological ones 
(primary link, herbivores, carnivores and bacteria) 
 
Fig. 16 The conceptual model of six-compartment ecosystem.  The masses Ci of different trophic levels 
are drawn by circles.  The arrows show the direction of matter flow between compartments.  The kinetic 
parameters r
ij
 reflect types of interactions and determine the value of fluxes.  For explanation and 
designation see the relevant sections in the text and in the Tables. 
 
and two of them are non-living compartments 
(nutrients and detritus).  All ecosystem fluxes of 
matter are closed.  All fluxes and kinetic 
parameters are expressed in terms of main primary 
production flow P
1
m
, all matter concentrations – in 
terms of total e cosystem concentrations of 
corresponding elements.  Such ecosystem 
presentation is very convenient because it gives 
the possibility to write the equation system similar 
to graph method.  This model is described by a 
system of 26 algebraic and differential equations 
(Tables 9 and 11).  The parameters of the first 
three links are close to parameters of “average 
phytoplankton”, “average herbivorous 
zooplankton” and “average carnivorous 
zooplankton” of NEMURO model (Eslinger et al. 
2000).  It is seen that the value of total resistance 
of link is inversely related to its maximum grazing 
(uptake) rate. 
 
Figure 17 shows the time-dependence dynamics of 
ecosystem component concentrations that were 
calculated using equations of Table 9 and 
parameters of Table 11.  The calculations were 
carried out using a specially developed program in 
TURBO PASCAL 7.  The comparison of Figure 
17a-f shows high sensitivity to changes of 
parameters.  So, a relatively small increase of 
carnivore biomass spending (from 7% to 16% of 
maximum grazing) leads to a chain of changes: 
noticeable decreasing its own biomass, increasing 
of biomass of previous link and decreasing of 
primary link (compare Fig. 17a, b).  The drastic 
shifts in biomasses are observed when the 
substrate constants (the analogue of half-saturation 
constants) change (compare Fig. 17b with c and 
d).  The great decrease in herbivore substrate 
constant leads to drastic decreases in primary link 
biomass.  The bulk of total mass exists in non-
living forms (detritus and inorganic matter;  
compare Fig. 17d and e).  There is revealed the 
tendency toward oscillations in this case.  Using 
the Michaelis-Menten rectangular hyperbola for 
nutrient uptake instead of the non-rectangular 
hyperbola, is equivalent to decreasing the substrate 
constant which leads to corresponding declines in 
the primary link biomass (Fig. 17f).  The tendency 
toward oscillations increases.

Fig. 18 NEMURO Model 2000, PICES CCCC prototype LTL marine ecosystem model.  Ecosystem is 
represented as ecological cycle of limited nutrient.  It is seen that cyclical flows of matter are the main 
attribute of ecosystem.  Sedimentation and upwelling are the parts of the cyclical fluxes.  Designation see 
in the original (Eslinger et al. 2000).

Fig. 19 The complicated NEMURO Model 2000.  Model includes the microbial food web and higher 
trophic level (HTL).  Such a model consists of 15 compartments.  PON and DON are the food of bacteria 
with different preference;  ammonium and nitrate are the sources of nitrogen.  Bacteria in turn are the 
food to Flagellates (Fl).  This model is describing by about of 60 algebraic and differential simultaneous 
equations.  HTL can migrate in and off the ecosystem.  Designation the same as in Figure 18. 
 
Such relatively simple model as Figure 16 can be 
very convenient for investigation of ecosystem 
operation and its sensitivity to parameter changes.  
This model is the step to development and 
investigation of more complex ecosystem with 
including in it the bacterial and higher trophic 
levels (such as Fig. 19). 
 
Figure 18 presents the NEMURO Model.  This 
model can be complicated by way of including in 
it the bacterial food web and link of higher trophic 
level.  Figure 19 presents the simplified variance 
of such a 15-compartment model.  This model is 
described by a system of about 60 equations. 
 
So the main difficulties lie in constructing the 
correct (close to reality) conceptual and 
mathematical models and in understanding its 
behavior.  Which of the factors have a strong 
effect on ecosystem behavior and what other ones 
have a low influence on the system behavior needs 
to be established.  
 
The unique approach, the possibility of composing 
the quantitative description of the schemes of 
arbitrary complexity gives the opportunity to apply 
it to all the processes in which the biological 
systems play significant part.  We are sure that the 
proposed approach, based on the mechanism of 
biological processes, will allow us to describe and 
to understand both the functioning of each 
processes of the ecosystem, and the ecosystem as a 
whole.  The results of our preliminary studies 
confirm such possibilities.

The development of a coupled lower and higher 
trophic level model can be guided by asking five 
basic questions: 
 
How many key functional groups link the lower 
and higher trophic levels? 
 
Real food webs are very complex.  Diet 
information can be used to determine the number 
of significant pathways linking LTL organisms to 
HTL predators.  Seasonal changes in the diet also 
need to be considered.  The model should have at 
least two pathways linking the lower and higher 
trophic levels;  three is probably better and is 
certainly more realistic.  Alternate pathways are 
important because they allow LTL production to 
flow at different rates, to different HTL predators, 
under different environmental conditions.  Three 
globally important LTL linking groups are:  
copepods, euphausiids and predatory zooplankton.  
The order of importance of each of these groups 
can be expected to vary from place to place, and 
probably over time in response to climate regime 
shifts and anthropogenic impacts. 
 
• Copepods are eaten by the larvae and juveniles 
of most higher trophic level fish species, and 
by all sizes of small pelagic fishes like herring, 
anchovy, sardine and sand lance.  
• Euphausiids and predatory zooplankton are 
also eaten by a wide range of small and 
medium sized pelagic species (including 
mackerel and small hake). 
 
For these reasons, the Task Team noted that 
consideration should be given to dividing the large 
zooplankton (ZL) component in the PICES 
NEMURO Model into separate copepod and 
euphausiid components.  
 
What HTL response do we want to model and 
why?  
 
Typically, the objective is to model the time-
varying daily nutrient flux, and the biomass and 
production rates of key HTL predators, which are 
of commercial and societal importance, so the 
current state of these organisms and the resource 
management implications can be evaluated.  
Computationally, and also because of limited 
knowledge of some of the important biological 
processes, it is difficult to handle more than ten 
HTL species (or functional groups) in most 
dynamic models.  An important exception to this 
is ECOSIM, which, because of the way it is 
structured, has the capability of handling up to 
fifty species.  The number of species (or functional 
groups) that need to be included depends on the 
purpose of the model.  A number of models of 
different complexity may be required to answer a 
range of species-specific questions. 
 
How should each species or functional group of 
species be represented in the model?  
 
The simplest arrangement is to have a single 
aggregated group (for example “small 
zooplankton” or “small pelagic fish”).  In other 
cases, it may be more appropriate to structure the 
model so some of the key species are represented 
as a population of multiple size, or age groups.  In 
all likelihood, the model will be structured with a 
mixture of simple, pooled functional groups, and 
one or more size or age structured species groups.  
60
For example, the HTL model could contain a 
detailed age-specific sub-model of herring, with 
the other HTL predators aggregated into one or 
more functional groups, similar to the European 
Regional Sea Ecosystem Model (ERSEM). 
 
How do HTL predators consume LTL 
production, or, what is the most likely 
functional response? 
 
If predators and prey tend to be distributed 
uniformly in space then it is appropriate to use a 
simple prey-dependent type II functional response 
to model the feeding rate (I).  Numerous short-
term experiments have found that a type II 
functional response appears to characterize the 
feeding response of a variety of predators (e.g. 
Valiela 1995).  However, experimental research 
has also shown that turbulent mixing, temperature, 
predator behaviour, and predator density can 
modify the functional response. 
 
Mixing  The rate of food consumption by fish 
larvae increases with the amount of turbulent 
mixing, because it increases the rate of prey 
contact (e.g. Sundby and Fossum 1990).  
Theoretically feeding rate increases with 
increasing turbulence, achieves a maximum at 
some intermediate turbulent mixing rate, after 
which feeding tapers off with increasing 
turbulence (Rothschild and Osborne 1988).  This 
phenomenon is most important for small 
zooplankton and fish larvae, and p erhaps some 
juvenile fish.  
 
Temperature  The rate of prey consumption and 
hence the maximum daily ration are dome-shaped 
functions of temperature (e.g. Brett and Groves 
1979). 
 
Predator behaviour  Although rarer, there are 
examples of an S -shaped type III functional 
response (e.g. Valiela 1995).  It may arise from 
changes in predator behaviour, like prey 
switching, or searching image formation. 
 
Predator density  If predators form dense schools, 
the resulting functional response will depend on 
both the predator (P) and prey (N) densities, in a 
manner that reflects feeding interference between  
the predators (Cosner et al. 1999).  Accordingly, 
some of the more probable functional responses 
formulations include: 
 
Holling Type II:  Prey (N) dependent functional 
response (I is the ingestion rate) when the predator 
is uniformly distributed (Fig. 20). 
I =  eN / (1 + ehN)

ingestion rate using a Holling II type functional 
response.  Parameters used are e=15.0, h=0.3. 
 
Holling Type III:  S -shaped prey-dependent 
functional response (Fig. 21). 
I = k / [1+ a exp(-bN)]

ingestion rate using a Holling III type functional 
response.  Parameters used are k=3.0, a=70.0, and 
b=10.0. 
 
Hassell-Varley Type:  Functional response 
depends on both prey (N) and predator (P) 
61
densities.  For a school of predators foraging in 3 
dimensions (Fig. 22): 
I = ecN / (P
1/3 
+ ehcN)

density and ingestion rate using a Hassel-Varley 
type functional response.  Parameters used are

How much consumed energy is converted into 
HTL predator production?  
 
Three important factors affecting HTL predator 
growth rates are the size of the food ration, the 
metabolic rate, and water temperature. 
 
The master bioenergetics equation is: 
I = E + M + G 
where I = ingested energy,  E = excretion,  M = 
metabolism, and G = growth (and reproduction).  
For well-fed carnivorous fish in the laboratory 
Brett and Groves (1979) found: 
(100)I = (27)E + (44)M + (29)G 
In natural ecosystems, E will probably be similar, 
but M will be much higher because of the 
additional metabolic costs incurred by finding 
food and avoiding predators, and because natural 
foods are not as digestible as the man-made foods 
that were used in these experiments.  Hence G will 
be much lower, probably around 10% to 15% of 
the ingested ration. 
• The growth rate is usually a saturating 
function of ration size (Brett et al. 1969), but 
in some cases it may be weakly dome-shaped 
at very high rations. 
• The growth efficiency tends to be highest at 
intermediate sized rations (Brett et al. 1969). 
• For any given ration, the resulting growth rate 
is a dome-shaped function of temperature 
(Brett et al. 1969).  In Figure 24, note how the 
highest growth rate occurs at a lower 
temperature when the prey density, and hence 
the ration, are reduced.  This is an important 
phenomenon, which the HTL component of 
the model should be able to reproduce.

specific growth rate (± 2 S.E.) of young 
Orcorhynchus nerka when fed various rations as 
percentage of body dry weight.  Points marked (X) 
and (O) are separate experiments using excess 
ration (after Brett et al. 1969). 
62
Are seasonal migrations by HTL predators 
important? 
 
Large biomasses of fish, birds and marine 
mammals migrate into or through most subarctic 
marine ecosystems in the summer to feed. 
• The arrival time and the biomass of these 
migrants can have a significant impact on the 
biomass and production of LTL prey species. 
(e.g. Robinson and Ware 1994).  
• The largest fish tend to migrate further north 
(e.g. sardine and hake in the NE Pacific).  
• Presumably the movements of migrating 
species are also affected by other factors like:  
temperature, food supply, predators, 
reproductive state, etc.  Much more needs to 
be learned about this. 
 
Diagnostic analysis 
 
Once the coupled model has been constructed and 
the output has passed a “reasonableness” test the 
model can be used as a tool to diagnose the current 
productivity of the system.  Time series 
measurements of important physical variables, like 
radiation, temperature, and wind speeds, and the 
estimated biomass of important fish species (from 
stock assessment analyses), can be input to the 
model to estimate the current lower trophic level  
productivity of the system, and the productivity of 
some key HTL organisms.  The results will enable 
fisheries managers to determine if the target 
harvest rates are sustainable.  This information 
will be very useful, because it will enable the 
manager to adjust the harvest rate annually, in 
response to model estimates of the current 
productivity of the system. 
 
Prognostic analysis 
 
Prognostic analysis is very difficult because it 
involves predicting the future state of complex 
ecosystems.  For successful long-range forecasting 
we need to be able to estimate how the future 
growth, mortality and recruitment rates of each 
key species in the model will respond to both 
“bottom-up” forced and “top-down” forced 
changes in the state of the system.  These changes 
are caused by natural variations in the physical 
forcing variables and by anthropogenic forcing, 
through global warming, habitat destruction and 
over-fishing.  Given our current, limited 
knowledge about many of the complex processes 
involved here, long-range productivity forecasting 
cannot be done with any precision at this time.  
Accordingly, the production of most HTL species 
should not be forecast more than a few years 
ahead, until the models improve.

A demonstration was given of a custom software 
that assists visualizing ecosystem model output.  
The tool organizes output information by trophic 
level and plots fluxes as a ration of production to 
biomass.  Figure 25 shows an example screen shot 
from an eastern tropical Pacific tuna fishery.

MODEL Workshop Summary 
 
At the Hakodate Workshop, the MODEL Task 
Team discussed some of the processes that need to 
be considered for representing LTL coupled to 
HTL trophodynamics in marine ecosystems.  The 
Task Team noted that significant advances in 
modeling the dynamics of LTL in aquatic systems 
(i.e. the microbial food web, and large 
phytoplankton and zooplankton) have occurred in 
the last decade.  Progress has also been made in 
linking the production of HTL organisms (e.g. 
squid, fish, seabirds, and marine mammals) to 
LTL production models.  Problems still exist when 
scaling process information and data to the scales 
required for marine ecosystem models.  Figure 26 
(ICES Study Group 1993) summarizes the 
relationship between observed species 
composition, state variables in modeling 
approaches that build from the “bottom up” with 
increasing complexity (and numbers of species).  
The suggested approach is to focus on the target 
species with links to lower and higher trophic 
levels by aggregating/sub grid-scale representation 
rather than including the full complexity of the 
neighboring trophic components.

integration as they relate to modeling ecosystems.  After ICES Study Group on Spatial and Temporal 
Integration, Glasgow, 1993 (ICES C.M. 1993/L:9). 
 
Since LTL and HTL organisms function on 
different time and spatial scales within the 
ecosystem, successful coupling requires getting a 
number of things right -- or just about right.  In 
this context, information about the diet, the 
functional response, growth efficiencies, large-
scale seasonal movements of migratory species, 
and the impact of climate variability on these 
processes are required.  For some marine 
ecosystems in the PICES area, enough biological, 
ecological, and stock assessment knowledge exists 
to begin using coupled models as primitive 
diagnostic tools to assess the current productivity 
and impacts of climate change on the ecosystem, 
and the effects on the dynamics of the key 
organisms within it.  The development of a 
successful prognostic capability is a more 
challenging, longer-term problem, which requires 
getting a number of other things right, such as 
recruitment dynamics, dispersal and migratory 
behavior, and behavioral changes in predator-prey 
interactions.  
 
Recommendations 
 
• Convene a MODEL Workshop to implement 
improvements to the PICES NEMURO model. 
• Increase interaction with BASS and REX to 
support their modeling initiatives through 
cooperative modeling workshops. 
• The CCCC Co-Chairmen should present these 
workshop proposals to the Science Board as a 
coordinated package of integrated activity 
underscoring the cooperation and 
interdependencies. 
• Facilitate joint planning; time needs to be 
allocated at the next PICES Annual Meetings 
for joint CCCC inter-sessional meetings. 
• Encourage opportunities for more CCCC Task 
Team interaction, joint CCCC Task Team 
meetings are needed to coordinate and 
implement Task Team plans.  In Victoria, the 
Task Team meetings should be at non-
overlapping times and places. 
• Request that the PICES Secretariat provide 
assistance to help MODEL build a web page 
to present NEMURO code, data and results. 
• Issues related to model management need to 
be addressed so as to better c ontrol the 
increasing number of different versions of a 
model, including process equations, parameter 
files, physical forcing data files, and post 
processing programs.  We propose to examine 
the ICES/GLOBEC experience to obtain 
guidance as to how best to proceed.  
• Develop “NEMURO/Stella” Box Model using 
the Stella software package. 
• Make progress on preparing an executable 
version of the prototype model available on 
the WWW. 
65
• Develop a means of staying in contact to 
continue unfinished work.  
 
Achievements and future steps 
 
• Link with high trophic level model. 
• The LTL model needs to include fishes, 
marine mammal, marine birds, and also micro-
nekton.  
• Perform basic model validation studies. 
• Develop model validation protocols. 
• Compare physical factors with direct 
observations. 
• Compare model biomass predictions with 
direct observations at Stations A7 and the 
Bering Sea. 
• Identify scientific questions for comparison. 
• Communication and cooperation with the 
REX and BASS Task Teams is needed. 
• Perform listed experiments.  
• NEMURO extensions: 
- add Fe limitation to phytoplankton 
production; 
- add microbial food web; 
- split ZL into copepods and euphausiids; 
- add sinking rate of phytoplankton to 
detritus pool; 
- parameterize NEMURO to a coastal 
region. 
• NEMURO diagnostics: 
- code diagnostic and performance 
measures into NEMURO such as P/B, C/B 
ratios and ecotrophic efficiency 
calculations;  
- validate model output against data fro 
each regional location; 
- perform side-by-side comparison of 
NEMURO Box and NEMURO MATLAB 
models to same equations and data. 
• Spatially explicit approach: 
- extend 1-D coupled model per above; 
- work toward eventually embedding 
NEMURO into larger scale 3-D ocean 
model similar to Kawamiya et al. (2000a, 
2000b). 
• Linkages with other CCCC components: 
- modify NEMURO per needs of REX and 
convene joint workshop to achieve 
extension of NEMURO to include higher 
trophic levels; 
- devise scheme to link NEMURO with 
ECOPATH/ECOSIM with the aim 
towards meeting the objectives of BASS. 
• Establish links with other programs such as 
GODAE, WCRP, CLIVAR. 
• Modifications as required to accommodate 
BASS and REX needs.

MONITOR WORKSHOP ON PROGRESS IN MONITORING THE NORTH 
PACIFIC  
(Co-convenors:  Bruce A. Taft and Yasunori Sakurai) 
 
 
A 2 -day MONITOR Workshop on “Progress in 
monitoring the North Pacific” was convened prior 
to the Ninth Annual Meeting in Hakodate, Japan 
(October 20-21, 2000).  The workshop reviewed 
ongoing and/or planned monitoring programs in 
North Pacific, and the section below contains 
extended abstracts of papers given at the meeting.  
As a result of the workshop discussions, the 
following recommendations were made: 
 
Continuous plankton recorder field program 
PICES should strongly support the principal 
investigators in their efforts to find long-term 
funding support for this important monitoring 
program.  It was pointed out that interpretation of 
the zooplankton data would be enhanced if 
ancillary environmental data were collected.  
Specific suggestions were:  (a) the collection of 
sea-chest temperature data;  (b) collection of sea-
chest water samples for salinity determination;  
and (c) underway measurement of fluorescence. 
Ocean tracking network for the coastal ocean 
Participants recognize the potential scientific 
benefits of the acoustic monitoring array and urge 
that PICES promote the timely evaluation of this 
proposal within the community to establish proof 
of concept.  
Preservation of existing North Pacific monitoring 
programs 
a. A biophysical mooring (designated station #2) 
has been maintained for the last five years 
southwest of the Pribyloff Is.  This time series 
data set has been used extensively to describe 
the variability of environmental conditions in 
this region.  It is slated to be terminated this 
year.  The Workshop recommends that PICES 
lobby in the scientific community for the 
continuance of this valuable time series.  
b. The Japanese shipboard program in the North 
Pacific is in transition.  The R/V Oshoro-Maru 
will not continue to occupy the Bering Sea 
section at 180º, and the Japan Fishery Agency 
(JFA) will take over this section.  The 180º 
section is a key section with a long tradition of 
state-of-the-art observations.  The participants 
recommend that PICES urge that every effort 
is made by JFA to provide a data set 
comparable in quality to the R/V Oshoro-Maru 
measurements.  
c. For the last 40 years JFA has supported a 
prefectural monitoring program in the coastal 
seas of Japan.  Shipboard measurements are 
made from the coast out to 60 nautical miles.  
The data are used for forecasting of coastal 
fishing conditions, and in addition constitutess 
very valuable climate data set.  JFA has 
proposed a 50% cut in funds for this program.  
The Workshop recommends that PICES call 
for an assessment of the effects of this 
proposed action on climate studies in this 
critical region.  
PICES/GOOS interaction 
The Workshop recommends that PICES set up a 
Steering Group to define the direction that PICES 
should take in integrating their regional interests 
with GOOS.  This Group would consider issues 
such as the identification of existing observing 
systems in the North Pacific which could 
contribute toward a regional PICES GOOS, new 
observations required to complete the system, and 
possible eventual establishment of a Regional 
Analysis Center (RAC), along the lines suggested 
by LMR-GOOS.  The Steering Group would also 
comment on the possible benefits to PICES 
countries of providing an annual ecological 
assessment of the state of the North Pacific. 
NEAR-GOOS Planning Workshop 
A NEAR-GOOS Forecasting Workshop is planned 
to consider the future strategy for the program.  In 
order to better serve the climate community 
NEAR-GOOS need to expand the types of data 
that they collect and archive by including chemical 
and biological data.  It was recommended that 
PICES work with the workshop planners to ensure 
that they have the necessary expertise for a 
successful workshop.  
71
Gulf Ecological Monitoring (GEM) program 
It was recommended that the MONITOR Task 
Team always include a scientist representing 
GEM, as this program is a major contribution to 
monitoring in the PICES region. 
 
 
 
Continuous Plankton Recorder measurements in Subarctic Pacific

Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) tows in the 
North Pacific were begun in March 2000, and a 
series of seven tows were completed in the March-
August time period.  The data return was 
apparently high and it is expected that 450 samples 
will be analyzed for the year.  Processing of the 
March-May 2000 samples has been completed and 
preliminary analyses of these data have been 
carried out.   
 
Neocalanus plumchrus is one of the dominant 
copepods of the subarctic North Pacific.  It was 
present in the March samples from just outside 
Prince William Sound (PWS) south to about 41° N 
but with no obvious peaks.  The majority of the 
individuals were stage 2 copepodites.  April 
abundances were generally higher, with maximum 
densities between 44° - 54°N.  There was a clear 
gradient in the apparent duration of development 
with most of the northern individuals still present 
as stage 2 copepodites whilst over 60% had 
reached stage 5 in the southern samples.  Such a 
gradient might be expected, since the duration of 
development probably depends on temperature.  
These data are the first to show such a pattern in 
development.  Preliminary analyses of the 
zooplankton community structure reveal distinct 
differences along the length of these two tows.  
The more “coastal” samples off PWS and 
California showed some similarities to each other 
and were clearly distinct from the more oceanic 
samples, however, samples within the oceanic 
region also showed some clustering.  Further 
analyses will reveal the species contributing to 
these differences, but the fact that communities 
can already be identified demonstrates that the 
sampling resolution will be adequate to 
characterize regional community composition. 
 
 
Comparisons of zooplankton sampling gear

Zooplankton collection devices cannot be 
calibrated - there are no absolute standards to 
compare the in situ capture or counting efficiency 
of various collection devices.  However, 
comparisons of efficiency among samplers, for 
example total biomass or size frequency captured 
and retained, are useful.  There are at least four 
types of situations where sampling equipment 
have been compared: 
1. Multiple collection devices were used on the 
same project and there is a scientific need to 
combine the data to form indices (example - 
Georges Bank GLOBEC). 
2. Collection devices were changed during a time 
series and there is a need to compare the catch 
before and after the change (example - Ocean 
Station P). 
3. A collection device is being used which is 
based on new technology and it is important to 
know how it performs relative to a more 
traditional device (example - compare acoustic 
estimates with net sample collections). 
4. International cooperative monitoring is 
undertaken and a comparison of sampling 
procedures used by various countries must be 
carried out (example- PICES CCCC Program).   
72
Reports were presented at the workshop by S. 
McKinnell (Canada) and K. Nakata (Japan), 
dealing with problems associated with adjusting 
time series to account for changes in method of 
measurement.  At Station P early measurements 
were made with a NORPAC net and after 10 years 
of sampling, a SCOR net was used.  McKinnell 
reported the results of over 50 comparisons of the 
two types of gear.  These collections spanned the 
range of zooplankton biomass observed at Station 
P.  He concluded that the NORPAC biomass 
estimates must be multiplied by approximately 1.2 
to be comparable to the SCOR net when 
flowmeter estimates of volume filtered are 
unavailable (e.g. Station P 1956-1981).  Another 
aspect of the study was that more than 40 paired 
comparisons were needed for adequate precision 
of the intercalibration.  Similar problems were 
reported by Nakata who identified significant 
differences between collections made with the 
NORPAC, Marutoku and Long NORPAC nets - 
particularly at high biomass levels.  Biomass was 
lowest with the Long NorPac net and the 
interpretation is that greater clogging of the Long 
NorPac net produced a systematic error.   
 
The ICES Working Group on Zooplankton 
Ecology held a “Workshop at Sea” in 1993 to 
make comparisons among different zooplankton 
samplers.  Thirty-eight scientists from eight ICES 
countries used two ships (Johann Hjort and A.V. 
Humboldt) to make simultaneous collections in a 
Norwegian Fjord.  Net systems compared were:  
WP2 net, CALCOFI net, Gulf III net, Bongo net, 
Multi-net, LHPR, BIONESS, and MOCNESS.  
The data are being examined for relative 
efficiency for estimation of total zooplankton 
biomass, zooplankton size-frequency distribution 
and depth distribution.  Manuscripts (Skjodal et al. 
unpublished) and a data CD are in preparation to 
describe the workshop results.  Note that the 
workshop did not receive designated funding.  All 
investigators participated using their own research 
funds. 
 
Recommendations 
 
1. PICES scientists are strongly encouraged to 
make their zooplankton time series internally 
consistent.  If collection equipment changed 
during the time-series, then sufficient repeated 
paired collections should be made using the 
different devices so that there is a statistical 
basis for quantitative adjustment of the various 
estimates of zooplankton biomass and size 
frequency distribution. 
2. Institutions holding long time-series should 
develop a strategy for dealing with anticipated 
instrumental changes.  Changes should not be 
introduced until an adequate relative com-
parison of the sampling characteristics of the 
new and old instruments has been carried out.   
 
 
Monitoring zooplankton production in the Subarctic Pacific

Newport, OR  97365, U.S.A.  E-mail: bill.peterson@noaa.gov 
 
Most monitoring work on zooplankton involves 
the collection of zooplankton with a plankton net, 
then preserving the sample with formaldelhyde or 
alcohol for later analysis of biomass and/or species 
composition and abundance.  In this note, I 
suggest that such efforts could easily be 
supplemented with experimental work on living 
zooplankton and with a small amount of training, 
experimental work could become routine and 
could be included in any shipboard monitoring 
program.  By following the methods given below, 
one can easily estimate growth and production of 
adult copepods (very easy to do) and growth and 
production of juvenile copepods (possible but 
more difficult).  The suggested methods can also 
be adapted for measurement of growth of 
euphausiids.   
 
One good reason for including production 
measurements is as follows:  analyzing a long 
time-series of zooplankton biomass and 
production, we would be able to determine if the 
73
interannual and decadal scale changes in biomass 
are due to changes in growth rate (i.e., production) 
or to other factors.  For example, subarctic Pacific 
experienced a two-fold change in zooplankton 
biomass after 1977.  Was this due to an overall 
increase in production of the subarctic or a two-
fold decline in predation on zooplankton? 
 
Methods 
 
To estimate production, one must incubate animals 
for 24 hours in ambient seawater at some constant 
temperature.  Female copepods are maintained in 
clean bottles of 500 mL or 1-liter capacity, 1 or 2 
females per container for large species (such as 
Calanus) and 5 -10 for small species (such as 
Paracalanus) for 24 h, during which time they 
will produce eggs.  Adult female copepods in most 
cases do not grow, rather channel all energy for 
growth into egg production.  Therefore egg 
production is a measure of growth.  Juvenile 
copepods grow by moulting from one copepodite 
stage into another.  If you know the moulting rates 
of a given copepodite stage, you can calculate 
growth, using the equations given below.  
Moulting rates are measured by incubating a 
number of juveniles of a given stage (30 or more 
animals per experiment) in a 1-L or 2-L container.  
A small number of those individuals will moult 
during the 24 h incubation period and those are the 
data used to calculate moulting rate in the 
equations below.  If such measurements are made 
along with measurements of chlorophyll 
concentration, one will, in time, build up an 
understanding of relationships between secondary 
production that, with luck, will allow calculation 
of copepod production from knowledge solely of 
copepod biomass and chlorophyll concentration.   
 
The basic equation used to calculate production 
(P) is  
P = gB 
where g is growth rate and B the biomass.  The 
growth rate of juveniles is given by 
g
i
 = ln (W
i
+1 / W
i
) * MR 
where W is the weight of copepodite stages and 
MR the moulting rate.  The growth rate of adults is 
given by 
gf = W
eggs
 / W
female
 
and total production is the sum of the two 
P = (g
i
 B
i
 ) + gf Bf

Report on standardization of plankton sampling by the national institutes of 
the Japan Fisheries Agency

Since 1964, national institutes of the Japan 
Fisheries Agency and prefectural fisheries 
experimental stations have conducted cooperative 
surveys for forecasting fishing and ocean 
conditions.  These surveys were primarily 
designed to measure the distribution and 
abundance o f eggs and larvae of pelagic fish.  
Plankton biomass was also a variable of interest.  
The measurements were made with a variety of 
sampling nets (Marutoku, Marunaka, NORPAC 
nets) so there was concern about the possibility of 
systematic errors in the survey results.  The 
sampling nets differed in mesh shape and size, 
type of gauze material, and in the ratio of filtering 
area to mouth area.  A working group was formed 
in 1993 to consider implementation of procedures 
74
to standardize the survey measurements.  T he 
working group identified the primary target 
organism to be fish eggs.  A requirement in the 
standardization of the plankton sampling was that 
the data from the new net should be comparable to 
that collected in the past.  They chose the Long 
NORPAC net for the standard net to be used in the 
furure, which has a ratio of the filtering area to the 
mouth size of 5.12 and consists of monofilament 
and plain weave gauze.  Measurements of the 
collection efficiency for total biomass have shown 
that the Long NORPAC net values are lower 
compare to the Marutoku and NORPAC nets.  
Therefore the old measurements with the 
Marutoku net must be adjusted downward to be 
comparable to the Long NORPAC net data.  
Further work is needed to compare the Marunaka 
net with the Long NORPAC net.  Further inter-
comparisons for the biomass sampling efficiency 
of all the devices in the size range will allow a 
uniform time series to be constructed 
incorporating the old data with the new data.

In marine ecological studies, one of the critical 
needs is the development of an accurate and

distribution of zooplankton.  Present microscope 
techniques are very labor intensive and often 
impractical.  Optical plankton counters are a 
possible solution to this problem.  Zooplankton 
biomass, zooplankton abundance and zooplankton 
biomass density have been measured by three 
methods and compared with those made by 
manual measurement under a microscope.  The 
three automatic methods are: in situ optical (OPC) 
and electrical (EPC) plankton counters and a 
laboratory optical plankton counter (OPC-L).  
Both zooplankton abundance and biomass density 
measurements with OPC-L were highly correlated 
(P<0.001), when particle concentration was less 
than 5 counts/sec.  However, there is a significant 
difference between samples from the Oyashio and 
Kuroshio regions:  the relation was more variable 
in the Kuroshio than in the Oyashio.  The plankton 
counter is capable of accurately reflecting 
differences in zooplankton abundance and biomass 
density and can be used under these conditions in 
zooplankton monitoring.  Particle size 
distributions measured by the OPC-L are similar 
to those obtained by manual measurement in the 
size range larger than 0.5 mm under the conditions 
that the particle concentration passing through the 
OPC-L is less than 5 counts/sec, and the samples 
were stained.  Identical samples were provided to 
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) so 
that they could make analogous OPC-L 
measurements with their counter.  Below 0.5 mm 
the SIO counts are consistently lower than the 
75
Japan National Research Institute of Fisheries 
Science counts (Fig. 1).  The source of this 
discrepancy is not understood.  In the area of low 
abundance of gelatinous plankton and/or 
Noctiluca, abundance and biomass density of 
zooplankton measured with OPC and EPC are 
strongly correlated (P<0.01) with manual 
measurements, under the condition that 
concentrations are less than 100 particles per liter.   
 
 
Design and testing of an underwater microscope and image processing system 
for the study of zooplankton

Oceanic ecosystem research needs a method to 
monitor the density of zooplankton at appropriate 
space-time scales.  In order to address this need, a 
submersible microscope was equipped with a non-
interlacing CCD camera.  The target plankton for 
this method of measurement included Copepoda, 
Ploima, and Ciliata, which are the dominant 
species in the coastal waters around Japan.  The 
key issues investigated for their possible influence 
on system performance were lens selection, 
camera selection, and method of illumination.  
Higher order local autocorrelation (HLAC) masks 
are used to extract features from images.  
Combining these with multivariate analysis, which 
is a two-step feature extraction method, results in a 
powerful tool for deriving general information 
from images.  In our procedures a set of these 
features provides a 33-dimensional vector.  To 
identify and count zooplankton, canonical 
correlation and discrimination analysis are 
performed.  These procedures allow zooplankton 
to be counted and classified into taxonomic units.  
Another canonical correlation analysis is made for 
the sizing of the plankton.  Proof of the principle 
experiment was obtained by using images of both 
preserved and living Copepoda.  At this stage the 
limitations on the performance of the HLAC 
features are not clear because the number of 
images and the number of species is small.  In the 
near future, a large number of plankton images 
will be collected, which will lead to improved 
algorithms for identification and counting.  Future 
improvements in image processing may also 
increase the accuracy of identification because the 
quality of the obtained images is expected to be 
very high. 
 
 
Status of the Census of Marine Life Program

The Census of Marine Life is an international 
research program that seeks to assess and explain 
changes in diversity, distribution and abundance of 
life in the oceans.  Development of the program 
was fostered through a series of workshops and is 
currently guided by an international Scientific 
Steering Committee (SSC) and managed by a 
Secretariat.  The SSC is preparing a draft scientific 
strategy document for review by the scientific 
community:  the overall program will be 
developed in cooperation with marine scientists 
and funding agencies from around the world.  
Regional assessments of marine life will address 
specific questions related to ocean biogeography.  
Ecosystems supporting extensive fishing, mid-
ocean ridges, seamounts, and open-ocean pelagic 
environments are under consideration.  An Ocean 
Biogeographical Information System is being 
developed, with several exploratory projects 
supported through the National Ocean Partnership 
Program.  Other areas of interest include the 
History of Marine Animal Populations  (HMAP) 
and the application of novel sampling technologies 
for marine populations.

Plan to monitor migrations of key species in the North Pacific

welchd@pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca 
 
Many marine animals are confined to the 
continental shelf ecosystem for much or all of their 
life.  For example, after entering the ocean from 
freshwater, Pacific salmon smolts generally move 
along the west coast of North America following 
the continental shelf (Fig. 2).  Earlier work had 
suggested that juvenile salmon began to move off 
the shelf by early fall and move directly into the 
Gulf of Alaska (e.g. Hartt and Dell 1986).  
However, subsequent studies (Welch et al. 1998) 
involving an extensive sampling period, have 
shown that all juvenile salmon remained along the 
continental shelf until reaching the Aleutian 
archipelago (note the location of the head of the 
final arrow in Figure 2). 
 
Because the continental shelf is narrow along the 
west coast of North America (shown in light blue), 
the migration corridor is restricted to a long thin 
region that can be monitored at many locations at 
relatively low cost.  Marked juveniles captured 
during surveys indicate that most salmon swim 
rapidly along the continental shelf (Fig. 3).  Some 
coho and chinook smolts remain as year-round 
residents of the coastal zone, while others migrate 
at least as far as the Aleutians islands before 
moving offshore. 
 
There are some populations of Pacific salmon 
which move southward along the continental shelf, 
opposite to the general pattern of movement 
(Weitkamp et al. 1995); at present, it is not clear 
why they do so or which groups are involved.  
Identifying which groups do so is an important 
management issue because this may partially 
determine which groups experience poor marine 
survival.  Newly developed acoustic technology is 
the basis of the proposed tracking program.  The 
miniature pingers to be placed on the individual 
fish (body length in excess of 15 cm) are 24 mm 
long and have an operational life of about four 
months (Eveson and Welch 2000).  Field tests of 
the acoustic receivers to be mounted on the bottom 
indicate that pingers can be detected at distances 
of perhaps 0.6-1.0 km.  The receivers have a life-
time of one year.  Because the shelf is usually less 
than 20 km wide, 20-30 receivers strung across the 
shelf and down the slope to a depth of 0.5 km 
should be capable of detecting all tagged animals 
crossing the line (Fig. 4). 
 
 
Fig. 2 Migration path of juvenile Pacific 
salmon.  All species (excluding steelhead) were 
found to remain strictly over the continental shelf 
(depths<200 m, shown in light blue).  The only 
juveniles we have found off the shelf were at the 
far end of the Alaskan Peninsula on Dec 7
th
, at the 
start of the Aleutian Islands. 
 
 
Fig. 3 Release (squares) and recovery (circles) 
locations for tagged juveniles.  Many of these 
animals travelled continuously at 1 -2 BL/sec to 
reach the recapture points, and thus moved very 
rapidly out of the estuary or coastal zone around 
their rivers of origin. 
77
 
 
Fig. 4 Conceptual example of a cross-shelf 
acoustic monitoring system.  The dots indicate the 
location of a series of linearly aligned receivers 
placed on the seabed, each capable of detecting an 
acoustically tagged animal at a distance of r 
meters.  The receivers would be placed D meters 
apart, chosen so that an animal swimming 
perpendicular to the array would remain within the 
detection area long enough to ensure reliable 
detection of at least one signal.  For example, if 
the detection radius was 600 m and this minimum 
path length was chosen to be 150 m, the receivers 
could be spaced 1.2 kms apart. 
 
The approximate cost of a single acoustic 
monitoring line is on the order of $50 K so that for  
roughly $2 M a network of 20 acoustic listening 
lines could be deployed that would stretch from 
California to the Aleutian Is.  The acoustic array 
would provide the basis for reconstructing the 
movements of any animal that was tagged with a 
uniquely identifiable sonic tag.  If initial design 
phase studies indicate that a credible observational 
program can be developed, the scientific 
objectives that a full-scale research program could 
address are listed below: 
1. Determine the ocean migration pathways of 
multiple species of animals and their rates of 
migration; 
2. Establish which stocks of salmon move to the 
offshore open Pacific or remain as coastal 
residents; 
3. Establish the shelf feeding grounds of the 
shelf-resident animals; 
4. Determine the period of time animals remain 
as residents of various sections of the coastal 
regime which are expected to be significantly 
affected by climate change; and  
5. Establish movement patterns for mature and 
immature salmon by tagging these animals in 
the ocean one or more years prior to return to 
their natal rivers.  Their movements up-river 
could also be tracked by placing receivers at 
various points in the rivers. 
 
 
Seabird monitoring and North Pacific ecosystem dynamics 
 
William Sydeman 
Point Reyes Bird Observatory, Stinson Beach, CA 94970, U.S.A.  E-mail: wjsydeman@prbo.org 
 
Seabirds are important constituents of marine 
ecosystems.  Worldwide, nine families of marine 
birds, totaling over 300 species, are full-time 
participants in marine energy and nutrient cycles, 
deriving all their food from the sea, voiding feces 
in the sea, and dying at sea.  Some seabirds feed 
almost exclusively on macro-zooplankton (e.g., 
auklets), while others have diets based primarily 
on nektonic fishes and cephalopods (e.g., murres, 
shearwaters and albatross). 
 
Monitoring seabirds is important because they are 
sensitive biological indicators of ecosystem state, 
providing information on environmental change 
on multiple temporal and spatial scales.  In 
addition, seabirds enjoy tremendous public support 
and are relatively inexpensive to study.  Moreover, 
because marine birds are conspicuous, widespread 
and abundant, seabird monitoring studies yield 
powerful and robust numerical information to test 
hypotheses concerning climate change and 
ecosystem response.  Interactions with fisheries, 
some positive and others negative, also provide 
impetus to monitor seabird populations and trophic 
dynamics. 
 
There are many types of seabird monitoring 
strategies depending on the methodology (e.g., 
colony-based, wildlife telemetry, and vessel-

based) and the temporal/spatial scales under 
consideration (e.g., short-term and long-term). 
Colony-based studies provide information on 
distribution and abundance, reproductive 
chronology and performance, and food habits.  
Similarly, shipboard monitoring of seabirds at sea 
provides information on distribution and 
abundance, and prey and oceanic habitat selection.  
Remote (e.g., telemetric) monitoring of seabirds at 
sea is a developing field that promises to reveal 
more information about oceanic habitat selection 
and predator-prey relationships on large spatial 
scales (e.g., basin wide).  Short-term studies often 
provide a brief, intensive snapshot of marine bird 
ecology (e.g., duration / destination of a foraging 
trip, marine bird aggregation at a specific 
hydrographic feature) ideal to discern the 
mechanistic linkages between seabirds and their 
environment.   
 
Long-term seabird monitoring provides 
information useful to place these short-term 
intensive studies in perspective by interpreting 
their findings in a climatic context.  Studies 
spanning several decades are ideal to detect and 
understand climatic change, including the phasing, 
intensity, and periodicity of climate change events 
(Fig. 5).  Examples include ecosystem response to 
inter-annual variability, as exemplified by the El 
Niño/Southern Oscillation cycle, and ecosystem 
response to inter-decadal variability in climate, as 
demonstrated by changes in state of the Pacific 
Decadal Oscillation.  
 
As secondary and tertiary consumers in marine 
ecosystems, monitoring marine bird trophic 
relationships provides a means of assessing major 
shifts in food web composition, the relative 
abundance of food web components, inshore and 
offshore movements of prey species, and bio-
physical relationships for many midtrophic-level 
organisms.  Studies have demonstrated how 
seabird productivity is related to inter-annual 
variability in coastal pelagic fish biomass, and 
how changes in the timing and intensity of 
mesoscale oceanographic events affects the 
apparent availability of prey to seabirds and other 
predators.  Other important, yet difficult to obtain 
information concerning the age, size, and sexual 
characteristics of forage fishes, cephalopods, and 
macrozooplankton (particularly euphausiids and 
large copepods) may be provided by coupling 
studies of marine bird food habits with direct ship-
board studies of these mid-trophic level 
organisms.  Importantly, many marine birds and 
large predatory fishes (e.g., salmonids) occupy the 
same trophic positions, and may respond to 
changes in climate and local oceanographic factors 
similarly.  Like predatory fishes, birds are 
sensitive to gradients in water characteristics (e.g., 
SST, thermocline depth, etc.) which promote 
primary productivity and aggregate prey.

Seabird monitoring has important applications for 
the assessment of human interactions with marine 
ecosystems, for example, changes in chemical and 
petroleum pollutants.  Repeated measurements of 
contaminant levels in seabird tissues and eggs 
have revealed long-term changes in persistent 
organochlorine pesticides, trace metals, and 
petroleum products, and the introduction of new 
contaminants in marine ecosystems.  Monitoring 
contaminants has highlighted the need to 
investigate confounding factors (e.g., oil pollution, 
climate change, and fisheries interactions) in 
relation to goals of understanding and predicting 
the population dynamics of many marine 
organisms. 
 
As part of the Living Marine Resources (LMR) 
module of the Global Ocean Observing System 
(GOOS), one could envisage a Seabird 
Observation System (SOS) devised to complement 
other oceanographic monitoring systems and 
sources of information.  One approach would be to 
augment existing marine bird time-series in both 
the western and eastern North Pacific Ocean, 
especially those longer than a decade, or those 
using new technologies (e.g., remote monitoring 
via satellite telemetry).  Advantages of this 
approach would be the enhanced spatial and 
temporal coverage of well-defined large marine 
ecosystems at a reduced cost.  There are a number 
of pre-existing cooperative research teams and 
infrastructures that could be used to promote 
information exchange.  For example, the Seabird 
Monitoring Database of the Pacific Seabird Group 
has summarized seabird monitoring data from 
colonies for most of the past 30 years.  This 
database will soon be available to the 
oceanographic community via the World Wide 
Web.   
 
Potential new directions for seabird monitoring 
programs are also required.  In particular, while 
seabirds provide an integrated and inexpensive 
means of monitoring both physical and biological 
oceanographic attributes, research is needed to 
calibrate the information provided by marine bird 
monitoring of ecosystem state and food web 
dynamics.  We must assume that seabirds are not 
unbiased samplers of marine ecosystems.  
Research designed to couple colony, at-sea, and 
remote seabird monitoring with oceanographic 
information based on traditional shipboard 
sampling and remote sensing would provide 
information needed to calibrate marine bird 
datasets.  Seabird observations on new research 
programs are also necessary to provide 
complementary information.  For example, 
because seabirds forage o n sub-surface prey, 
marine bird observations in conjunction with the 
PICES/Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) 
project would serve to help identify oceanographic 
changes that might influence variability in the 
plankton data.  Finally, a system to monitor global 
contaminant levels through non-destructive 
predator tissue sampling would provide the 
oceanographic community with new information 
about anthropogenic impacts on marine 
ecosystems. 
 
 
Role of regional organizations in the design of GOOS 
 
Ned Cyr 
Global Ocean Observing System, IOC/UNESCO, Paris, France.  75015  E-mail: n.cyr@unesco.org 
 
Although the basic operational units for GOOS 
implementation are national observing systems, 
several regional GOOS activities have been 
initiated;  these include EuroGOOS, MedGOOS, 
Africa-GOOS, Pacific-GOOS, Near-GOOS, ICES-
GOOS, IOCARIBE-GOOS and Black Sea-GOOS.  
These regional activities have been created for 
various reasons:  conduct ecosystem assessments, 
existence of common economic interests, 
economies of scale in operating observing systems 
and decentralization of GOOS administration.  
Groups of countries can initiate regional GOOS 
activities as long as they adhere to the published 
GOOS principles. 
 
One model for a regional GOOS activity relevant 
to PICES is ICES, another intergovernmental 
marine science organization.  In 1997, ICES 
80
recognized the opportunity to establish a regional 
GOOS for the North Atlantic and accordingly set 
up an ICES-IOC Steering Group for GOOS with 
the following term of reference:  “prepare an 
action plan for how ICES should take an active 
role in the further development and implemen-
tation of GOOS at a North Atlantic regional level 
with special emphasis on fisheries oceanography”. 
 
After reviewing options for an ICES-GOOS, it 
was recommended that an observing system be 
developed with two elements:  (1) an Atlantic 
component focused on climate; and (2) a regional 
component focused on ecosystem dynamics of the 
North Sea with emphasis on the need to improve 
management of fish stocks.  ICES is moving 
toward the implementation of both components.   
 
Provisional terms of reference of a GOOS/PICES 
Scientific Steering Group (SSG) could be: 
1. Determine the ways in which PICES can assist 
in the implementation of GOOS and advance 
its own interests. 
2. GOOS (LMR module report) has proposed 
that ecosystem monitoring be designed and 
carried out by scientific groups familiar with 
particular ecosystems.  The SSG should 
consider the desirability of PICES assuming 
the responsibility for reporting on the state of 
the North Pacific ecosystem. 
3. In support of GOOS, a number of scientists in 
PICES have suggested setting up a Regional 
Analysis Center (RAC) for the North Pacific.  
The RAC would issue periodic assessments of 
the state of the North Pacific ecosystem.  The 
SSG s hould make a recommendation to the 
Science Board as to whether or not the design 
of a RAC should be undertaken.   
4. If the recommendation is made to proceed 
toward setting up a PICES RAC, the SSG 
should make specific recommendations on its 
structure, e.g. distributed (virtual) center or 
physical center with dedicated personnel, 
centers in the western and eastern Pacific or a 
single center, etc. 
5. The SSG should report to the Science Board at 
PICES X. 
6. Suggested membership of the SSG is David 
W. Welch (Canada), W arren S. Wooster 
(U.S.A.), Takashige Sugimoto (Japan) and 
Vyacheslav B. Lobanov (Russia), with Ned 
Cyr (GOOS) as a liaison member. 
 
 
Long-term plans of NEAR-GOOS 
 
Maarten Kuijper 
IOC/WESTPAC, c/o National Research Council, Bangkok, Thailand.  E-mail: westpac@samart.co.th 
 
NEAR-GOOS is one of the regional GOOS bodies 
focusing its efforts on the Northeast Asia region.  
Its member states are Japan, the People’s Republic 
of China, the Republic of Korea, and Russia.  
These countries have agreed to a common data 
exchange policy under the NEAR-GOOS 
framework.  During the last few years, the major 
emphasis of NEAR-GOOS has been on solving 
problems of data processing, archiving and 
creation of data products.  A limited set of 
physical parameters has been addressed: 
temperature, salinity, ocean currents, winds and 
ocean waves.  In the long term, it is expected that 
the NEAR-GOOS system will expand to better 
serve the overall goal of global ocean and climate 
monitoring and forecasting. 
 
The NEAR-GOOS system operates through two 
different modes:  a (near) real-time database and a 
delayed mode database.  Data are kept in the real-
time database for 30 days and then transferred to 
the delayed mode database and added to the long-
term records.  The databases are maintained b y 
different agencies.  The Japan Meteorological 
Agency (JMA) and the Japan Oceanographic Data 
Center (JODC) carry out the respective data 
aggregation at the regional level.  There are a 
number of future developments that are 
envisioned: 
1. At the present time other data sets are being 
considered for inclusion and archival:  sea 
level, dissolved oxygen and inorganic 
nutrients.  In addition, NEAR-GOOS will 
undertake to access remotely sensed variables 
81
such as satellite altimeter sea-height, ocean-
color and scatterometer wind measurements. 
2. Another concern is the application of data 
quality standards to the submitted data.  Up to 
the present time it has been understood that 
data quality has been the responsibility of the 
data provider.  NEAR-GOOS recognizes that 
they must be able to provide users a statement 
of data quality and will begin to address ways 
of doing this routinely. 
3. Potential users of the archived data set often 
have needs for specific data products.  NEAR-
GOOS will consider adding products based on 
assimilation of data into models (including 
forecasting models).  The choices will be 
made in such a way that they do not compete 
with existing specialized agencies that support 
similar or more advanced systems. 
4. Cooperation should not be limited to the 
NEAR-GOOS area.  Participation in global 
research programs (GODAE, CLIVAR, etc.) 
offers valuable opportunities for the 
development of data applications in the 
NEAR-GOOS system. 
 
NEAR-GOOS will hold a three-day workshop in 
August 2001, in conjunction with the Fifth 
IOC/WESTPAC Scientific Symposium in the 
Republic of Korea.  The focus of the workshop 
will be the current status and need of ocean 
forecasting capacity in the NEAR-GOOS area.  
PICES will be asked to participate. 
 
 
Argo:  Progress toward implementation

The Argo program proposes to deploy globally an 
array of 3,000 profiling floats to provide real-time 
observations of the temperature and salinity 
structure of the upper layer of the ocean.  The 
floats are designed to drift at a depth of 2,000 m 
and rise to the surface every 10-14 days to 
measure the vertical profiles of temperature and 
salinity.  After relaying the profile data to shore 
via satellite, the floats will descend to 2,000 m to 
begin another cycle.  The lifetime of a float is 
expected to be four years.  
 
Argo is being planned under the auspices of the 
World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission 
(IOC).  The February 7, 2000, joint IOC-WMO 
Circular Letter JCOMM No.00-2 states that “... it 
is an important component of the operational 
ocean observing system, as well as a major 
contribution to scientific research programs”.  
International support for Argo has increased 
greatly over the past year.  As of August 23, 2000, 
11 countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, 
India, Japan, New Zealand, Korea, Spain, U.K., 
U.S.A.) and the European Union have proposals 
 
on file to fund 2,324 floats.  Proposals for 425 
floats have already been funded.  In addition to 
these nations, China and Norway have expressed 
interest in providing floats.  
 
All Argo data - both real-time and delayed-mode - 
will be available to anyone, with no period of 
exclusive use.  Real-time data will be put on to the 
Global Telecommunications System within 12 
hours of collection for use by operational 
forecasting agencies.  Delayed-mode data, which 
have been scientifically quality controlled, will be 
accessible via the Internet within 90 days of 
collection.  Locations and functions of Argo data 
centers and data exchange formats are under 
discussion by an Argo data-system task team. 
 
Performance of Argo sensors has been under 
evaluation for several years.  Provisional standards 
for instrument accuracy are 0.005°C for 
temperature, 0.01 psu for salinity and 5 db for 
pressure.  Tests of deployment of floats from 
commercial vessels at full speed indicate no 
adverse problems, and the U.S. Navy is evaluating 
aircraft deployment of floats. 
 
82
Since Argo floats are untethered freely drifting 
objects, some floats may enter the EEZs of non-
participating countries.  This is a particular 
concern of Pacific island nations.  In order to 
address these concerns, IOC Resolution XX-6 was 
adopted that “...concerned coastal states must be 
informed in advance ….of all deployments of 
profiling (Argo) floats which might drift into 
waters under their jurisdiction (i.e. EEZs)”. 
 
The International Argo Science Team (IAST) was 
created to review national plans and commitments 
in order to formulate a strategy for global coverage 
for the benefit of all nations.  Current members of 
the Team are U.S.A., Japan, Canada, Korea, 
China, Australia, New Zealand, E.U., Germany, 
France, U.K. and India.  The third IAST meeting 
will take place at the Institute of Ocean Sciences, 
Sidney, Canada, in March 2001.   
 
Regional model of a long-term marine science program:  Gulf of Alaska 
Monitoring (GEM)

In 1999, the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council 
dedicated a fund, expected to be $120 M by 
October 2002, to support a program of research 
and monitoring in the northern Gulf of Alaska in 
perpetuity.  The goal of the program is to promote 
use of living marine resources through increased 
understanding of the ways in which natural and 
human factors cause changes in these resources.  
The Trustee Council invites the scientific 
community of PICES to participate in planning 
and implementing the program.   
 
The entry point for those who wish to participate 
is the draft GEM program document that describes 
the policies of the Trustee Council, and the 
scientific background for the northern Gulf of 
Alaska and related ecosystems (available on the 
web at www.oilspill.state.ak.us).  Drawing on the 
expertise of many concerned scientists and the 
scientific literature, the draft program provides the 
scientific basis for regional monitoring in terms of 
North Pacific and global climate and 
oceanographic processes.  The program document 
advances a conceptual foundation of how 
geophysical and human factors cause changes in 
the abundances of living marine resources through 
impacts on availability of food, amount of habitat 
and extent of removals by activities such as 
fishing.  Long-term monitoring is expected to be a 
large part of the program, based on experience and 
research on a large-scale ecological disaster - the 
1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.  Lessons learned 
during the decade following the oil spill point out 
that understanding the sources of changes in living 
marine resources, whether natural or influenced by 
human activities, requires a solid historical 
context.  Comments on the program document and 
suggestions for monitoring activities are open until 
October 2001, which is the target date for 
completion of the review now underway by the 
USA National Research Council’s Polar Research 
Board.  The NRC review and other peer-review 
comments will be used to produce the first call for 
proposals under GEM in late winter 2002.  Initial 
implementation is expected in October 2002, with 
further consideration of proposals for funding at 
regular intervals thereafter. 
 
It is emphasized that the process of developing the 
scientific basis for GEM is now ongoing.  For 
example, as part of the process of encouraging 
cross-disciplinary cooperation in the design of 
GEM, a workshop was held in Anchorage in 
October 2000, to exchange ideas on monitoring 
and research in the northern Gulf of Alaska.  
Teams of scientists from geophysical and 
biological sciences met with policymakers and 
stakeholders to develop responses to specific 
examples for monitoring and research in the 
region.  Results from the workshop indicate broad 
support among scientists for long-term monitoring 
of physical and biological processes in order to 
understand and evaluate change in living marine 
resources.  Specific recommendations from the 
83
workshop will be incorporated into the process of 
developing the first invitation for proposals in 
2002.  To receive a summary of the workshop 
sessions or to be put on the mailing list for future 
information and activities, please contact 
gem@oilspill.state.ak.us. 
 
The proper development of the regional GEM 
program has important consequences for PICES, 
and for other international marine scientific 
organizations.  An important lesson learned in the 
aftermath of the oil spill was that coordination 
among researchers, integration of data acquisition 
operations, and synthesis of results across 
disciplines are essential to make cost-effective 
progress in understanding change.  PICES has 
been established to promote international 
cooperation, integration and synthesis for the same 
purposes.  The Trustee Council has studied 
national and international scientific programs to 
find additional models essential to the 
development of a regional monitoring program.  
The approaches of the Global Ocean Observing 
System (GOOS) and the Global Ocean Ecosystem 
Dynamics (GLOBEC) have been found to be fully 
consistent with the policies established by the 
Trustee Council for GEM.  GOOS seeks to define 
a core set of physical and biological variables 
essential to understanding changes that can be 
adapted to local user needs.  GLOBEC has 
focused on understanding physical forcing of 
primary and secondary productivities in relation to 
production of higher trophic level organisms such 
as fish.  These aspects of GOOS and GLOBEC are 
to be incorporated into the development of the 
GEM program. 
 
 
Seasonal variability of temperature/salinity structure on repeated sections in 
the Okhotsk Sea

Far Eastern Regional Hydrometeorological Research Institute, Vladivostok, Russia.  690600 
 
Physical processes in the Okhotsk Sea have a 
strong influence on regional climate.  In order to 
understand the role of external factors on water 
mass structure, measurements of water 
characteristics on a variety of space and time 
scales are needed.  Seasonal variations of water 
properties on two quasi-zonal hydrographic 
sections (central and southern Okhotsk Sea) have 
been estimated for three periods: spring (May-
June), summer (July-September) and autumn 
(October-November).   
 
The temperature structure is characterized by a 
thermocline (strongest in summer and weakest in 
fall) in the surface layer, a temperature minimum 
layer at about 100 m (coolest in summer) and 
warmer temperatures at depth.  Seasonal tempera-
ture variability is strongest near the Sakhalin and  
Kamchatka coasts.  On the southern section, the 
depth of the core layer thermocline is 75-100 m, 
and deeper off Kamchatka than off Sakhalin.  
Negative temperatures at the core are confined to 
west of 151°E, 150°E and 148°E respectively, in 
spring, summer and fall.  Under the cold layer 
seasonal temperature variations are small. 
 
Salinity increases monotonically with depth.  On 
the sections the largest seasonal variation of 
salinity in both surface and subsurface waters 
occurs near the two boundaries.  On the northern 
section, the freshest water, due to Amur River 
runoff and melting, is found in the spring off 
Sakhalin (21-24 psu).  In summer, on the northern 
section the salinity off Sakhalin increases to  
23-24 psu and the low salinities spread to 150 m 
and to the east.  Off Kamchatka salinity varies 
from 31.6 to 32.0 psu over the three seasons.  In 
the southern Okhotsk Sea, close to the Sakhalin 
coast, the average surface salinity varies from 
32.0-32.3 psu in spring, to 31.1-31.9 psu in 
summer and to 30.0-30.5 psu in fall. 
 
These results might be considered as the first 
approximation to the seasonal variation of 
temperature and salinity in the central and 
southern Okhotsk Sea and could serve as a 
baseline for future monitoring in the region.

REX WORKSHOP ON TRENDS IN HERRING POPULATIONS AND 
TROPHODYNAMICS   
Co-convenors:  Douglas E. Hay, Tokimasa Kobayashi, William T. Peterson and Vladimir I. 
Radchenko  
 
 
A 2-day REX Workshop on “Trends in herring 
populations and trophodynamics” was convened 
prior to the Ninth Annual Meeting in Hakodate, 
Japan (October 20-21, 2000).  Papers were 
presented by 8 speakers from among 25-30 
participants.  At the workshop, we learned that 
there are long time series (80+ years) of data for 
herring populations related to catch, size-at-age, 
length and weight, spawning time, distribution 
and age composition.  Shorter time series are 
available for biomass estimates, age-structured 
abundances, survival index, production and 
instantaneous growth rates.  Process studies have 
examined food habits and energetics, vertical 
distribution, timing of migration, age-specific 
habitat requirements, larval survival and distri-
bution, juvenile abundance and distribution, 
genetic structure of populations, densities of 
herring aggregations, gonad weight and 
fecundity and key competitors and predators. 
 
As a result of the workshop discussions, the 
following generalizations, observations and 
hypotheses were generated: 
 
1. Herring populations are broadly distributed 
but geographically discrete. 
2. The effects of fish community dynamics on 
herring size at age merit further study. 
3. There are striking patterns in size-at-age 
including a pronounced decline since the 
1970's for recruited herring adults. 
4. There is some coherence in year-class 
strength among regions necessitating further 
analysis. 
5. The frequency of year-class strength varies 
along a latitudinal cline. 
6. There are recognizable types of herring.  
Lagoon herring are confined to Japan, 
Sakhalin Island and southeast Kamchatka.  
Coastal herring are small-sized and short-
distance migrators found ubiquitously but 
especially along the eastern Pacific Ocean.  
Oceanic herring are large, fast growing and 
long distance migrating fish confined to 
Hokkaido-Sakhalin, Okhotsk, Kamchatsky and 
the Bering Sea. 
7. Herring is an indicator species to investigate 
bottom-up response to climatic variability at 
various time scales. 
8. Where data exist, there are strong links between 
zooplankton biomass and herring dynamics. 
9. Numerical modeling suggests that 
environmental impacts o n herring and 
zooplankton dynamics exceed those imposed by 
herring predation. 
Those interested in more information and/or 
references to any of the above statements should 
contact William Peterson (bill.peterson@noaa.gov). 
 
Another topic of discussion was the need for REX 
herring scientists to work with the MODEL Task 
Team on incorporating “fish” into the NEMURO 
model.  At the present time, the NEMURO model is 
primarily an NPZ (Nutrients-Phytoplankton-
Zooplankton) model.  Both REX and MODEL 
scientists felt s trongly that the time is right for 
MODEL to explore the ways and means of adding F 
(fish) to the NPZ formulations, and that herring 
would be an excellent model organism.  We felt that 
herring would be a great choice because much is 
known about herring ecology, herring growth and 
feeding rates as well as trophodynamics in general.  
To facilitate this interaction, interested members of 
REX will work together to summarize herring 
population dynamics and trophodynamics 
parameters that are needed to model herring growth.  
Thus, as an inter-session topic, REX members will 
work (using e -mail) to complete a matrix of life 
history parameters, growth parameters in relation to 
environmental variables (seasonal cycles of 
temperature, nutrients, and biomass of 
phytoplankton and zooplankton) for one or two 
herring stocks.  Since such data will likely be 
variable among years and may be showing long-term 
trends, we may find it instructive to produce 
matrices for various decades (1970s, 1980s etc.). 
 
85
A final discussion topic concerned the nature of 
future REX sessions.  For PICES X we decided 
to focus on size-at-age for fish species other than 
herring within the PICES study region.  We will 
look for patterns in size-at-age among genera 
and relate these to climate variables where 
possible.  We will discuss environmental factors 
that may affect size-at-age and consider density-
dependence and zooplankton biomass where 
possible.  Fish species for which we expect to 
find considerable amounts of data include 
salmonids, whiting, halibut, mackerels, sardines 
and anchovies.  A proposal was also received to 
consider a topic session on “Phytoplankton, 
zooplankton and nekton synchrony in the use of the 
spring bloom event in the North Pacific”.  The idea 
stems from an observation of several PICES 
scientists that there have been shifts in the timing of 
the seasonal peaks in zooplankton biomass.  If a 
workshop focused on this topic, we would produce a 
review of the timing of spawning of herring stocks 
around the Pacific Rim in relation to the timing of 
the spring bloom and timing in peaks in zooplankton 
biomass.  The first steps would be to make an 
inventory of herring spawning times, phytoplantkon 
biomass and copepod biomass. 
 
 
Abundance, biology, and historical trends of Pacific herring, Clupea pallasi, in 
Alaskan waters

Introduction 
 
Alaska occupies the northeast corner of the 
range of Pacific herring, Clupea pallasi.  Within 
this range the growth and recruitment patterns of 
Pacific herring are quite plastic, yet spatial and 
temporal patterns on differing scales link the 
biology of Pacific herring to the underlying 
physical oceanography and the biological 
elements of the ecosystem.  The spatial and 
temporal patterns in growth and recruitment 
within Alaska provide linkages to herring 
biology at adjoining corners of the North 
Pacific.  Much of what we have learned about 
herring biology has been motivated by the long 
history of commercial exploitation of herring.  
This paper describes the biology of herring in 
Alaska, the history of Alaskan herring fisheries, 
a sampling of the rich amount of information 
that can be mined from commercial catch 
records, and notes some new remote sensing 
technologies that may further increase our 
understanding of herring biology. 
 
Biology of Pacific herring in Alaska 
 
Pacific herring spawn at discrete locations from 
Dixon Entrance in Southeast Alaska to Norton 
Sound (Fig. 1).  Spawning occurs on intertidal and 
subtidal vegetation in late spring.  The exact timing 
of spawning is closely related to temperature, and 
progresses around the Alaska coast from March in 
Southeast Alaska, to June in Norton Sound.  In 
warmer years, herring spawning occurs coherently 
earlier throughout Alaska.  However, there are some 
patterns in the time series of herring spawning that 
do not appear to be explained just by temperature 
variability.  For example, at Sitka Sound, herring 
spawning has occurred three weeks earlier than in 
recorded history since 1993.  The changes in spawn 
timing can be biologically significant, affecting

piscivores that are focused on herring spawning in 
the spring. 
 
The life history strategy of Pacific herring is 
distinctly different in the Gulf of Alaska compared 
to the Bering Sea.  Bering Sea herring attain large 
body size (to 500 g), whereas Gulf of Alaska herring 
are approximately half that size.  The eastern Bering 
Sea herring are long-distance migrators.  The largest 
population spawns along the north shore of Bristol 
Bay, near the village of Togiak.  Following 
spawning, these herring migrate in a clockwise 
direction down along the Alaska Peninsula, reaching 
the Unimak Pass area in early July (Funk 1990).

Fig. 1 Location of Alaska herring spawning populations, and timing of fisheries that targeted 
spawning herring in 1999, illustrating the south to north gradient in run timing, and the clockwise 
migration of Togiak-spawning herring around the eastern Bering Sea. 
They feed along the continental shelf edge, slowly 
moving northward to overwinter near the Pribilof 
Islands.  The Bering Sea herring life history 
strategy appears to be an adaptation to take 
advantage of the distant rich feeding grounds and 
benign overwintering areas on the continental 
shelf edge, while utilizing the protected inshore 
bays for summer larval nurseries.  In contrast, Gulf 
of Alaska herring are smaller, have shorter 
lifespans, more frequent recruitment events and do 
not undergo long-distance migrations.  In the Gulf 
of Alaska, recruitment events tend to occur 
synchronously over fairly broad areas which 
contain otherwise discrete spawning aggregations.  
Gulf of Alaska herring have some genetic 
distinction from Bering Sea herring (Grant and 
Utter 1984). 
 
In addition to the spatial plasticity in body size, 
Fig. 2, top), successive age classes of herring 
undergo very large and biologically significant (up 
to 30%) changes in body size.  These anomalies in 
growth are strongly autocorrelated, and appear 
almost cyclic in size-at-age time series that date 
back to the reduction fisheries of the early 1920s 
(Fig. 2, bottom).  The cause of these apparent 
cycles in body size is not known, but the 
anomalies have been correlated to a time series of 
zooplankton abundance measured at Prince 
William Sound salmon hatcheries, and also to the 
Pacific Decadal Oscillation (Evelyn Brown, 
University of Alaska Fairbanks, pers. comm.).  
There is only a mild effect of density dependence 
seen in adult herring at studied locations in 
Alaska, such as Prince William Sound (Fig. 3).  
However, density dependence could be an 
important mechanism affecting larval and juvenile 
herring growth, for which little time series data 
exists. 
 
Recruitment also shows signs of periodic 
autocorrelated anomalies.  In the Gulf of Alaska 
recruitment time series, a four-year cycle of strong

year classes is apparent, although that pattern has 
changed recently (Fig. 4).  Recruitment events 
occur more frequently in the Gulf of Alaska 
(typically averaging every fourth year), whereas in 
the Bering Sea, strong recruitment events occur 
much less frequently, typically averaging every 
tenth year.  Most areas experienced a positive 
response in recruitment associated with the 1977 
regime shift.  
 
These recruitment indices were derived from 
routine agency stock assessments in support of 
fishery management.  Year class abundance is 
quantified at a recruiting age of three in the Gulf 
of Alaska, and age four in the Bering Sea.  Adult 
survival rate is usually treated as constant for stock 
assessment purposes.  When this holds, the 
recruitment time series provide an excellent 
measure of abundance for comparison to long-
term climate indices, particularly because herring

can drastically alter adult survival rates.  When 
adult survival rate changes substantially, the 
recruitment time series will not provide a good 
measure of adult abundance.  Thus far, substantial 
changes in adult survival appear to be relatively 
rare, so that the recruitment indices typically 
provide a reliable index of abundance for both 
juveniles and adults. 
 
Based on patterns in size-at-age and recruitment, 
Williams (1999) grouped Alaska herring into three 
categories:  Bering Sea, Outer Gulf of Alaska, and 
Inner Gulf of Alaska.  The spatial scale of these 
groupings reflect the spatial scale of 
oceanographic processes underlying herring 
productivity, as well as the different Bering Sea 
and Gulf of Alaska life history strategies.  Fishery 
managers need to understand finer spatial scales of 
herring stock structure than these large groupings 
based on coherence in growth and recruitment 
anomalies.  Because herring milt can be readily 
observed from aircraft and precisely defines 
spawning locations, fishery managers use maps of 
herring milt locations to define discrete groups of 
herring appropriately sized for management units. 
 
Trends in herring abundance and historical 
catch in Alaska 
 
Pacific herring have been commercially harvested 
in Alaska for over a century, beginning with 
fisheries for salt-cured and reduction products in 
Southeast Alaska.  During the last two decades 
herring have been taken primarily for sac roe, with 
lesser amounts taken for bait.  Harvest policies 
have become more conservative, resulting in more 
stable stock levels and overall catches.  Herring 
fisheries provide an important contribution to the 
income of many Alaskan fishermen, with most of 
the harvest concentrated during the brief spring 
herring-spawning period. 
 
Fishery history   
 
Herring have supported some of Alaska’s oldest 
commercial fisheries, and subsistence fisheries for 
herring in Alaska predate recorded history.  The 
spring harvest of herring eggs on kelp has always 
been an important subsistence resource in coastal 
communities throughout Alaska.  Traditional dried 
herring remains a major staple of the diet in 
Bering Sea villages near Nelson Island (Pete 
1990), where salmon are not readily available. 
 
Alaska's commercial herring industry began in 
1878, when 30,000 pounds of salt-cured product 
were prepared for human consumption.  By 1882, 
a reduction plant at Killisnoo in Chatham Strait 
was producing 30,000 gallons of herring oil 
annually.  The herring reduction industry 
expanded slowly through the early 20
th
 century 
reaching a peak harvest of 142,000 mt in 1934 
(Fig. 5).  Exploitation rates were quite high during 
the reduction fishery era, with large fluctuations in 
stock levels and annual harvests.  As Peruvian 
anchovetta reduction fisheries developed, Alaska 
herring reduction fisheries declined, so that by 
1967, herring were no longer harvested for 
reduction products in Alaska.  
 
A Japanese and Russian trawl fishery for herring 
began in the central and eastern Bering Sea in the 
late 1950s, reaching a peak harvest of 146,000 mt 
in 1970.  Much of the herring taken in these 
fisheries were from western Alaska coastal 
spawning stocks.  These high harvests were likely 
not sustainable and the foreign fishery declined 
until it was eventually phased out with the passage 
of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act in 1976. 
89
Contemporary fisheries 
 
Substantial catches of herring for sac roe began in 
the 1970s as market demand increased in Japan, 
where herring harvests had declined dramatically.  
Presently, herring are harvested primarily for sac 
roe, still destined for Japanese markets.  Statewide 
herring harvests have averaged a pproximately 
45,000 mt in recent years, with a value of 
approximately $30 million. In addition, about  
400 mt of eggs on kelp, worth approximately  
3 million, are harvested annually by commercial 
fisheries. 
 
Approximately 25 distinct fisheries for Pacific 
herring occur in Alaskan waters (Table 1).  Almost 
all of these herring fisheries are closely linked to a 
specific spawning population of herring.  There 
are three general types of herring fisheries in 
Alaska, identified by season, product, gear and 
BOF regulations.   
 
Most of the herring harvest currently occurs 
during sac roe fisheries, which targets herring just 
before their spring spawning period.  Both males 
and females are harvested, although the sac roe 
fisheries target the much higher-valued roe-
bearing females.  Alaska statutes require that the 
males also be retained and processed and not 
discarded as bycatch.  Herring fisheries usually 
incorporate spotter aircraft and are extremely 
efficient.  On occasion the entire allowable harvest 
has been taken in less than one hour.  However, 
most sac roe fisheries occur during a series of 
short openings of a few hours each, spanning 
approximately one week.  Fishing is not allowed 
between these short openings to allow processors 
time to process the catch, and for managers to 
locate additional herring of marketable quality. 
 
Spawn-on-kelp fisheries harvest intertidal and 
subtidal macroalgae with freshly deposited herring 
eggs.  Both of these fisheries produce products for 
consumption primarily in Japanese domestic 
markets.  Smaller amounts of herring are harvested 
from late July through February in herring 
food/bait fisheries, largely to provide bait in 
Alaskan longline and pot fisheries for groundfish 
and shellfish.  Smaller amounts are used for bait in 
salmon troll fisheries, with occasional utilization 
for human or zoo food. 
Harvest policies used for herring in Alaska set the 
maximum exploitation rate at 20% of the 
exploitable or mature biomass, consistent with 
other herring fisheries on the west coast of North 
America.  The 20% exploitation rate is lower than 
commonly used biological reference points (Funk 
1991) for species with similar life history 
characteristics (Fig. 6).  In some areas, such as 
Southeast Alaska, a formal policy exists for 
reducing the exploitation rate as the biomass drops 
to low levels.  In other areas, managers similarly 
reduce the exploitation rate as abundance drops, 
without the more formal exploitation rate 
framework. In addition to exploitation rate 
constraints, minimum threshold biomass levels are 
set for most Alaskan herring fisheries.  If the 
spawning biomass is estimated to be below the 
threshold level, no commercial fishing is allowed.  
Threshold levels are generally set at 25% of the 
long-term average of unfished biomass (Funk and 
Rowell 1995).

provided the primary stock assessment 
observations since the beginning of the sac roe 
fisheries in the 1970s.  In most areas of Alaska, 
these observations are integrated with a time series 
of age composition and catch in stock assessment 
models for estimating abundance.  In recent years 
we have been exploring remote sensing tools to 
augment the existing programs and to provide 
more synoptic coverage of herring stocks and 
fisheries.   
 
A compact airborne spectrographic imager (CASI) 
has been successfully used to assess herring school 
surface areas when herring are in shallow coastal 
waters prior to spawning (Funk et al. 1995).  
Herring are color-adapted for a pelagic existence, 
so that they are readily discriminated from 
background water by multispectral methods using 
the green band of the reflected light spectrum.  
LIDAR, a scanning laser sensor, has also been 
successfully used to assess pelagic fish species 
(Churnside et al. 1997, Lo et al. 2000), including 
herring in Alaska.  LIDAR provided acoustic-like 
information down to 50 m in the Gulf of Alaska 
during the summer of 2000 Oscillation (Evelyn 
Brown, University of Alaska Fairbanks, personal 
communication).  LIDAR provides information 
about other light-reflecting targets in the water 
column in addition to fish, and may be particularly 
informative about the distribution of deeper 
scattering zooplankton layers near the limits of its 
attenuation.  LIDAR information is acquired from 
aircraft that can synoptically survey large areas of 
the continental shelf, thus capturing “snapshots” of 
processes that are too dynamic to sample using 
conventional tools.  Although the resolution of 
satellite multispectral sensors is getting 
sufficiently fine to discriminate herring schools, 
the frequent cloud cover over Alaskan coastal 
areas during the herring spring spawning p eriod 
severely limits their application.  Synthetic 
aperture radar (SAR) has been successfully used to 
describe the distribution of fishing fleets in 
Alaska, including Bering Sea crab and herring 
fisheries (Clemente-Colon et al. 1998).  SAR uses 
microwave radiation and is not affected by cloud 
cover.  In addition, SAR can discriminate ocean 
surface structures such as fronts and eddies, which 
provide meaningful augmentation to the 
distribution of fishing effort for determining the 
distribution of fishery target species. 
Conclusions 
 
Commercial fisheries provided motivation for 
collecting and archiving several long time series of 
basic biological information.  “Data mining” from 
these time series may help elucidate important 
basin-wide ocean productivity mechanisms and 
may be helpful for understanding climate change.  
In particular, Pacific herring in Alaska display 
patterns of biologically significant, autocorrelated 
anomalies in body size, recruitment, and time of 
spawning.  Examining these dramatic spatial a nd 
temporal patterns over broader geographical areas 
can help to generate hypotheses about productivity 
mechanisms to efficiently guide future research.

Three ecological forms of Pacific herring (Clupea 
pallasii) are found in the Far-Eastern Seas:  
marine, coastal, and lake-lagoon.  Marine herring 
spend their entire life in salt-water or the ocean 
and it undertakes extensive migrations.  When 
foraging, its natural habitat includes both shelf and 
bathypelagic waters.  Lake-lagoon herring spend 
most of their life cycle in freshwater reservoirs and 
move to the neighboring waters to forage.  Coastal 
herring inhabits the shelf zone of separate gulfs or 
big bays exclusively and does not migrate 
considerably.  Russian waters of the Northwest 
Pacific are inhabited by 6 populations of sea 
herring and 20 populations of coastal and lake-
lagoon forms (Fig. 7).  This ecological variety 
allows the species to obtain food resources of this 
area of water, and is responsible for its high 
abundance and wide distribution. 
 
Marine herring are characterized by a pulsing 
natural habitat.  During the growth of biomass it 
increases in abundance, but it also happens at the 
expense of bathypelagic waters and the 
populations in neighboring territories.  Reduced 
abundance is usually associated with warm water 
masses, and is accompanied by a gradual cessation 
of reproduction in the southern parts of the range 
and a shifting of reproduction centers to the north. 
 
Fig. 7 Distribution of marine herring in the Far 
Eastern Seas. 
A remarkable peculiarity of the Pacific herring is 
considerable change in abundance and biomass of 
populations in different years.  Fluctuations of the 
stock-size are conditioned by different producti-
vity of generations.  For the years of observation 
in large Far-Eastern populations of marine herring, 
generations have differed in number by one 
hundred times, and adjacent generations by 8 to 60 
times.  Often, year-class strength fluctuates with a 
definite periodicity, but in some intervals of time 
this cyclic pattern is broken. 
 
Distinctions in abundance are evident in both year-
classes and populations in the northern and the 
southern herring groups.  Southern populations

(Peter the Great Bay, Sakhalin-Hokkaido and 
Dekastri) have no stable high frequency cycles of 
strong and poor year-classes.  The difference in 
productivity between adjacent year-classes is 
relatively small.  A five-year cycle of abundance is 
usual in the northern group of populations 
(Okhotsk, Gizhiginsk-Kamchatka, Korf-
Karaginsk, Anadyrsk) and the distinction in 
productivity rate between year-classes is the 
highest.  The abundant offspring in the northern 
populations occurs more often than once in 5 
years, whereas in the southern populations it may 
be from 3-6 years, one after another.  For a long 
time, strong year-classes have coincided in two 
populations:  Okhotsk and Eastern-Bering Sea 
(Fig. 8) while Gizhiginsk-Kamchatka has 
experienced a long depression.  During the last 
years a number of the species in the Japan Sea 
have approached historical minima and are in need 
of various protection measures. 
 
The dynamics of the northern populations stock-
size was different.  The highest number of herring 
in the northern part of the Okhotsk Sea and the 
western part of Bering Sea was achieved in the 
1950s and early 1960s, i.e. at the epoch of the 
maximum solar activity of the last secular cycle 
(Fig. 9). 
 
The second half of the 1970s and the 1980s were 
characterized by a shift in the climate of the 
Northwest Pacific t hat badly influenced herring 
reproduction.  During this period, all the northern 
populations were at a low level and universally, 
fishery activities were limited to a sparing mode.  
In the 1990s, spawning stocks of the Okhotsk, 
Gizhigisk-Kamchatka and Korf-Karaginsk herring 
experienced a series of average and relatively 
strong year-classes and the number of spawners 
greatly increased.  These populations have now 
passed the crisis.  The sparing mode of fisheries 
has ended and renewed intensive exploitation o f 
the species occurs in the northern part of the 
Okhotsk Sea and western part of the Bering Sea. 
 
Russian herring catches in the Far-Eastern Seas 
have experienced considerable fluctuations in 
different years.  The catch peak occurred in the 
late 1920s to early 1930s (Fig. 10).

1928) and Dekatstri (25,000 t in 1926).  By the 
end of the 1930s the abundance of these two 
94
populations, and also the Sakhalin-Hokkaido 
population by the mid-1940s, were considerably 
depleted and the catches appreciably reduced.

and the western half of Bering Sea. 
 
The Gizhiginsk-Kamchatka and Korf-Karaginsk 
herring have been the object of intensive fisheries 
since the late 1930s, and the Okhotsk herring since 
the mid-1940s.  By the late 1950s to early 1960s, 
the catches of the first two populations had 
reached a historical maximum:  120,000-160,000 t 
and 100,000-260,000 t, respectively.  Starting in 
the 1960s, the Okhotsk population held a leading 
position in herring catch.  During some years 
(1963-1975) the whole volume of catch by the 
Soviet fishing companies exceeded 200,000 t.  At 
the end of the 1960s, a regular peak of catches of 
the Pacific herring was noticed – somewhat more 
than 500,000 t – which was achieved mainly by an 
intensive catch of the Okhotsk foraging herring. 
 
Since the mid-1970s, i.e. during last two decades, 
the herring catch in the Far East underwent a deep 
crisis.  The abundance of all large marine herring 
populations was depleted.  For each population 
they went to extremes in regulating the fishery – it 
was completely prohibited.  At the West Bering 
Sea (the Korf-Karaginsk herring) and the North-
East Okhotsk Sea (the Gizhiginsk-Kamchatka 
herring) the prohibition persisted for more than  
10 years, 1970-1986 and 1974-1990 respectively.  
Nevertheless, in spite of the extreme management 
actions undertaken, the abundance of these 
populations increased only slowly during the early 
1990s, and only during the last several years has a 
considerable increase in abundance been observed.  
In 1997-1999, Russian fishermen alone caught 
more than 300,000 t (in 1998 – over 400,000 t) of 
herring.  In the near future they expect the species 
resources to be satisfactory. 
 
The total catch of Pacific herring in Russia 
(USSR) since 1904 is 18,600,000 t, an average 
annual catch of 192,000 t.  By population, the 
catch is distributed as follows:  the Sakhalin-
Hokkaido population – 7,372,000 t, the Okhotsk 
population – 6,987,000 t, the Korf-Karaginsk 
population – 1,865,000 t, the Gizhiginsk-
Kamchatka population – 1,014,000 t, other (Peter 
the Great Bay, Dekastri, all coastal and lake-
lagoon population) – 1,407,000 t.

Introduction 
 
Herring have been one of the most important 
components of the British Columbia commercial 
fishery over the past century with catch records 
dating from 1877.  The fishery has evolved from a 
dry salted product in the early 1900s, to a 
reduction fishery in the 1930s that collapsed in the 
late 1960s.  After a four-year closure the current 
roe fishery began in 1972.  Roe fisheries occur just 
prior to spawning when the fish are highly 
aggregated and very vulnerable to exploitation.  
Since 1983, herring roe fisheries have been 
managed with a fixed quota system.  Under this 
system harvest levels are determined prior to the 
season based on a fixed percentage (20%) of 
forecast stock size.  In addition, threshold biomass 
or cutoff levels were introduced in 1985 to restrict 
harvest during periods of reduced abundance. 
 
In this report, long-term trends in several 
biological characteristics of British Columbia 
herring stocks are presented based on stock 
assessments from two analytical models.  An 
escapement model reconstructs population 
abundance from surveys of the spawning beds and 
egg deposition.  In addition, a catch-age or age-
structured model is used to reconstruct stock 
abundance for the period 1951-2000.  Trends in 
recruitment, harvest rate, total production, 
95
population growth rate, survival rate, size at age, 
and condition factor are also presented for each of 
the five major herring populations found within 
British Columbia. 
 
Methods 
 
Pacific herring abundance in most of North 
America is assessed annually through some form 
of spawn assessment survey since the eggs are 
adhesive to algae and remain attached intertidally 
until hatching.  Within British Columbia five 
major migratory herring populations are 
recognized and assessed annually (Queen 
Charlotte Islands, Prince Rupert District, Central 
Coast, Georgia Strait, west coast of Vancouver 
Island).  Annual estimates to total stock abundance 
and other biological characteristics for each 
herring stock were determined from the egg 
assessment surveys using the escapement model 
(Schweigert and Stocker 1988).  Annual harvest 
rate for each stock was determined as the 
proportion of the estimated mature or spawning 
population removed by the fishery.  Abundance of 
the year-classes in each stock was determined 
from the catch-age model and is the estimate of 
the number of 3 year old herring which recruit to 
the fishery. 
 
Population production was determined as the 
growth in total biomass from year to year summed 
across ages following (Chapman 1968):

P

B = average biomass at age a to

The estimated average biomass also includes a 
component due to the annual production and loss 
of gonadal products.  Weight of the gonad 
production was determined from the weight of 
individual fish at each age in each population 
using relationships developed by Ware (1985) for 
females.  Gonad production of males was assumed 
to follow the relationship for females. 
 
An annual survival index was also estimated for 
each stock based on the return of the spawning run 
in year t+1 relative to the escapement the previous 
season:

E

 = estimated number of spawning fish at age a 
in year t; 
C
a+1,t+1
 = estimated number of age a+1 fish caught 
in year t+1. 
 
To investigate any long-term trends in population 
fitness that may be linked to food supply and 
ocean productivity, the average size at age was 
determined for each stock in each year.  
Unfortunately, no herring were aged during the 
period of the population crash from 1965-1970, so 
no information is available during this period.  In 
addition, the average condition factor was 
calculated for each stock, each year, as:

Results and discussion 
 
Pacific herring were fished extensively for 
reduction from the early 1930s through the late 
1960s when the stocks collapsed.  During this 
period harvest rates frequently reached 70-80 % of 
the total available stock in each area.  Much more 
conservative harvest rates occurred during the roe 
fishery of the past 30 years.  Nevertheless, 
population abundance has fluctuated dramatically 
throughout both periods (Fig. 11) due to the 
recruitment of good or poor year-classes in each 
area (Fig. 12).  Population production has also 
fluctuated markedly throughout this period. 
Production had generally been high in the 1950s 
and early 1960s reaching a minimum in the late 
1960s as the stocks collapsed (Fig. 13).  In all 
areas production increased rapidly in the early 
1970s as stocks rebuilt, particularly in the south.

QCI, PRD, and WCVI has remained low whereas 
in the other two areas production has approached 
the levels of the 1950s.  Total production has 
varied markedly between stocks averaging 5000 t 
in QCI, 5-10,000 t in PRD, 10-15,000 t in CC, 25-
30,000 t in GS, and 15-20,000 t in WCVI.  
Population production of herring appears to be 
related largely to recruitment rather than changing 
growth patterns.  Estimates of instantaneous popu-
lation growth or the P/B ratio indicates higher 
levels of population turnover in the 1950s and 60s, 
when harvest rates were very high and the biomass 
was concentrated in the y ounger faster growing 
age classes.  Since the early 1970s, population 
growth has been stable in all areas but population 
production as a whole has continued to fluctuate. 
 
The survival index was variable particularly 
during the early part of the time series which may 
be due to poorer data quality.  There is no 
indication that survival was better or worse during

periods of good recruitment.  This suggests that 
factors affecting adult survival differ from those 
leading to enhanced survival and recruitment at 
juvenile stages.  Further support for this 
hypothesis comes from an examination of the 
long-term trend in both size-at-age and condition 
factor. 
 
The population characteristics investigated here do 
not indicate any long-term trends that might be 
associated with environmental effects on herring 
production.  There appears to be some support for 
density dependent changes in growth rate.  Size at 
age increased from the early 1960s through the 
mid-1970s, when coastwide herring abundance 
was greatly diminished (Fig. 14).  Subsequently, 
size at age has declined in all areas although there 
is some evidence of a recent increase in some 
areas. Interestingly there is no evidence of any 
coincident changes in condition factor for these 
stocks (Fig. 15).  The data suggest a slight increase 
in condition through the 1970s, but it has been 
stable over the past two decades.

The most important component of the total annual 
production of herring stocks is the recruitment of 
young fish into the adult population.  A better 
understanding of the effects of environmental 
conditions on the survival of juvenile herring is 
necessary to establish the links between herring 
production and the ocean environment.

Introduction 
 
Herring are zooplanktivorous fish and depend on 
seasonal availability of prey for growth and energy 
storage (Blaxter and Holliday 1963).  Herring are 
vertical migrators, so diel differences in spatial 
overlap with prey items are important for feeding 
(Blaxter and Holliday 1963).  The diets of juvenile 
herring in Prince William Sound (PWS) vary on 
multiple spatial and temporal scales (Foy and 
Norcross 1999a).  Feeding intensity is highest in 
May and June, when zooplankton biomass and 
energy density peaks (Foy and Norcross 1999a, b).  
Feeding in winter is below levels required for 
general maintenance (Foy and Paul 1999).  Near-
shore zooplankton abundance, diversity, and 
species composition in PWS have been linked to 
seasonal and annual trends in temperature and 
salinity (Foy 2000).  Environmental variables 
influence fish condition directly by affecting 
growth rates and indirectly by altering the 
community structure of the prey.  Juvenile herring 
growth rates in PWS were significantly correlated 
to average water temperatures in 1996 and 1997 
(Stokesbury et al. 1999).  Zooplankton species 
composition and abundance were significantly 
correlated to temperature and salinity in the same 
time period (Foy 2000).  The objective of this 
study was to examine the response of juvenile 
herring feeding behavior to zooplankton 
availability and environmental conditions in PWS.  
To accomplish this, we establish trends in the 
herring diet composition and prey preference.  
 
Methods 
 
PWS is a large, fjord-type estuarine system 
consisting of numerous shallow bays, fjords, and 
tidewater glaciers located on the southern coast of 
Alaska (Niebauer et al. 1994; Fig. 16).  We 
sampled fifteen times between March 1996 and  
 
Prince William Sound
Simpson Bay
Zaikof Bay
Whale Bay
Eaglek Bay
 
Fig. 16 Location of study sites in Prince 
William Sound, Alaska.  Simpson, Eaglek, Whale 
and Zaikof Bays were sampled from 1996 until 
1998. 
 
March 1998, in two fjords with depths >250 m 
(Eaglek and Whale Bays), and two estuaries with 
depths <100 m (Simpson and Zaikof Bays).  
Within 7 days, each bay was sampled during the 
day:  0800-1559h, evening:  1600-2359h, 
morning:  0000-0759h.  Data from the four bays 
were pooled for this study due to consistent 
interannual trends among bays. 
 
Multiple samples were collected and processed 
from each sample site.  Temperature loggers were 
deployed at a central location in each of the four 
bays at a depth of 5 m.  Vertical zooplankton tows 
were made with a 0.5 m 300 µm mesh ring net 
from multiple sites within the four bays. 
 
Juvenile herring (<250 mm) schools (n=194) 
caught using a purse seine vessel with a 250 m x 
34 m or 250 m x 20 m, 150 mm stretch mesh 
anchovy net or a trawl vessel with a 40 m x 28 m, 
150 mm mesh mid-water wing trawl net.  Depth of 
the tow was dependent on fish depth, determined 
by hydroacoustics.  Fish were blotted dry, weighed 
to the nearest 0.01 g, and standard length (SL) 
99
measured to the nearest 1.0 mm.  Stomach content 
was reported as % body weight (%BW) by 
dividing the stomach content weight by total fish 
weight.  Taxa from each stomach were enumerated 
and identified to the lowest possible taxonomic 
level.  Post-processing analyses included 
determining taxa richness (number of taxa) and 
prey selectivity using Chesson’s selectivity (a) 
index (Chesson 1978; 1983) (see Foy and 
Norcross 1999a and Foy 2000).  For selection 
information of particular prey species see Foy 
(2000).  Life history stages of prey were identified 
when possible and were limited mostly to egg, 
nauplius, larva, juvenile and adult male/female. 
 
Results 
 
Temperature in the nearshore surface waters 
ranged from 4.3 to 13.3° C in 1996, 3.5 to 14.8°C 
in 1997, and was 5.0°C in March 1998 (Fig. 17).  
Temperatures at 5 m were significantly different 
among months (F=155.4, df=14, P<0.01).  
Temperatures were coolest in March in 1997 and 
1998, and warmest in August in 1996 and 1997.  
The fall of 1997 and the spring of 1998 were 
significantly warmer than those of the previous 
year. 
 
The zooplankton density in the upper 30 meters 
was seasonally and interannually variable.  
Zooplankton density was highest in June 1996 at 
3166 zooplankters per m
3
 (Fig. 18, top).  
Zooplankton abundance decreased in the winter of 
1996-1997 to less than 90 zooplankters per m
3
.  
Zooplankton densities were significantly higher in 
May 1997 than May 1996 (F=27.2, df=94, 
P<0.01).  Zooplankton densities in July, August, 
and October 1997 were all significantly lower than 
in the same months in 1996 (P<0.01).  No 
sampling occurred in June 1997 to compare to 
1996.  The zooplankton species richness was 
highest in May of both 1996 (41 taxa) and 1997 
(34 taxa) and lowest in October 1996 (28 taxa) and 
1997 (23 taxa) (Fig. 19).  There was an overall 
decreasing trend in the number of zooplankton 
taxa between May of 1996 and October 1997. 
 
The number and diversity of prey taxa in the 
herring diets per fish varied among months and 
between 1996 and 1997.  The number of prey per 
herring stomach in 1996 increased from 91 in 
March to a peak of 1209 in July, and then declined 
to 3 in December (Fig. 18, bottom).  Zooplankton 
density significantly accounted for variation in the 
density of prey in juvenile herring diets (F = 
22.39, P = 0.0003, df = 15, R
2
 = 0.62; Fig. 20).  
Species composition consisted mostly of small 
calanoid copepods and Cirripedia from March to 
June, while Cladocera and Larvacea became 
important between June and October.  In 1997 the

Fig. 21 The number of prey taxa from juvenile 
herring diets collected from March 1996 to March 
1998, in four Prince William Sound bays.  Blank 
spaces represent months that were not sampled. 
average number of prey was larger in May (398 
prey per fish) than July (278 prey per fish).  The 
dominant species in the diets varied between small 
copepods, large copepods, Cirripedia, Euphau-
siacea and Larvacea in 1997. 
 
Juvenile herring had significantly more prey per 
fish in May 1997 than in 1996, corresponding to 
the increased availability of prey in May 1997 
(F=12.3, df=354, P<0.01).  The number of prey 
per fish for every other month in 1997 was 
significantly lower than in 1996 (P<0.01).  The 
number of taxa in the diets of the herring was 
highest in July 1996 (9 taxa) and May 1997 (7 
taxa) (Fig. 21).  The lowest number of taxa in the 
diets occurred in December 1996 (2 taxa) and 
October 1997 (1 taxon).  All 1997 months except 
May had fewer taxa in the diets than in 1996.  The 
number of empty stomachs was highest in winter 
(November to March) and lowest from June to 
August (Fig. 22, bottom).  The percentage of 
empty stomachs in October 1997 was three times 
greater than in October 1996. 
 
Juvenile herring were more selective during the 
winter months when prey was scarce than in the 
summer months when prey was abundant (F=4.79, 
df=13, P<0.01; Fig. 22, top).  Selectivity index 
values ranged from 0.17 to 0.65 in 1996 (monthly 
neutral value range = 0.06 to 0.14) and from 0.22 
to 0.77 in 1997 (monthly neutral value range was 
from 0.04 to 0.22).  Juvenile herring were signifi 
cantly more selective in October 1997 than in 
October 1996 (P<0.01). 
 
Diet taxa richness, evenness, composition and prey 
selectivity differed with time of day.  The number 
of taxa in the diets was significantly higher from 
1600 to 2359h than 0000 to 0759h or 0800 to 
1559h.  Evenness of prey taxa in herring diets was 
significantly higher from 0800 to 1559h 
(confidence interval:  0.64 ± 0.3), when diversity 
was low, than from 0000 to 0759h (confidence 
interval:  0.60 ± 0.3) or 1600 to 2359h (confidence 
interval: 0.60 ± 0.3).  The diel difference in diet 
composition was due to the presence of large 
calanoid copepods from 0000 to 0759h.  From 
0800 to 1559h, invertebrate eggs, Oikopleura sp., 
and small calanoids dominated the diets.  In the 
evening category (1600h to 2359h) small calanoid 
copepods and Cladocera were the most abundant 
101
in herring diets.  Juvenile herring were 
significantly more selective from 0000 to 0759h 
than from 0800 to 1559h or from 1600 to 2300h. 
 
Though similar times were sampled each year to 
avoid bias due to light levels, depth distribution of 
herring changed over the study.  The monthly 
average fish depth in 1996 decreased from 32 m in 
March to 10 m in August, and then increased from 
32 m to 38 m in the winter (Fig. 23).  The monthly 
average fish depths in 1997 were deeper than in 
the summer of 1996, increasing from an average 
of 48 m in March to 28 m in August.  Evenness of 
prey taxa in diets was higher for fish caught 
deeper in the water column than shallower 
suggesting that herring may be less selective in 
deeper water where light levels are lower. 
 
Discussion 
 
Zooplankton availability varies seasonally and 
annually among and within bays in PWS (Foy 
2000).  Zooplankton species composition and 
abundance are dependent on multiple biological 
and environmental factors.  The seasonal 
variability in zooplankton density encountered in 
this project was typical given the strong seasonal 
production cycles in PWS.  The decline in 
zooplankton density and number of taxa between 
1996 and the fall of 1997 was, however, not 
expected.  There was also a shift in species 
composition in the zooplankton community 
occurring particularly in the fall between 1996 and 
1997 (Foy 2000).  
 
The decline in zooplankton abundance observed in 
the summer of 1997 coincides with increased 
temperatures that occurred at the same time (Foy 
2000).  Temperatures were 2°C warmer in the fall 
and winter of 1997, and may have been 
instrumental in indirectly reducing zooplankton 
density and composition due t op predation and 
species succession.  Temperature has been found 
to affect the availability of zooplankton prey for 
Bering Sea larval herring (Maksimenkov 1982).  
Although higher temperatures may enhance 
zooplankton production, we speculate that the 
higher temperatures may have increased the 
herring demand on its prey population due to 
increased growth.  These events combined with 
factors affecting stratification in the water column 
such as increased temperatures and freshwater 
runoff, may have limited nutrient input to the 
euphotic zone in the fall, inhibiting productivity 
that could support secondary production.  Our 
zooplankton sampling did not continue into the 
winter of 1997-1998 to study the effects of a 
warmer than normal winter in PWS. 
 
Diel variability in the amount of feeding was 
encountered at multiple scales.  Increased feeding 
from 1600 to 2359h is consistent with other 
studies of juvenile herring (Raid 1985; Arrhenius 
and Hansson 1994).  Herring are visual feeders 
and they feed more in low light hours as they are 
vertically migrating to the surface (Blaxter et al. 
1982).  The increase in feeding on large calanoid 
copepods from 0000 to 0759h when there is most 
likely a large overlap of predator and prey 
distributions is suggestive of selective feeding due 
to the size of prey (Sandstrom 1980; Flinkman et 
al. 1991). 
 
Seasonal species composition of prey in the diets 
was closely related to the species composition of 
zooplankton found in the nearshore PWS in 1996 
and 1997 (Foy 2000) and in this region of the 
Northeast Pacific (Vogel and McMurray 1982; 
Cooney 1988).  More feeding during the summer 
months was expected as a response to increased

zooplankton availability (Foy and Norcross 1999b, 
Foy 2000) following increased primary production 
during the spring in PWS (Goering et al. 1973).  
The species succession of prey in 1996 juvenile 
herring diets from spring (small Calanoida and 
invertebrate eggs) through summer (small 
Calanoida and Cladocera) was similar to the Baltic 
Sea herring diets (Mehner 1993, Arrhenius 1996), 
suggesting that the zooplankton species 
composition is similar at upper taxonomic levels 
in the nearshore areas of these two systems.  In 
May 1997, species composition of prey found in 
the diets was similar to May 1996, but large 
changes in species abundance and composition 
occurred in July 1997 and subsequent months.  
Regression analyses suggest that increased 
temperature decreased the availability of prey and 
caused the fish to remain deeper in the fall, all of 
which may have influenced this change in diet 
composition.  Similar trends in species 
composition were noted in the zooplankton 
community and speculated to be due to the 
increased temperatures (Foy 2000).  The change in 
the depth of the fish (Fig. 23) may be due to either 
a direct response by the juvenile herring to the 
warmer temperatures or to the lack of available 
prey in the upper water column during the summer 
and fall of 1997. 
 
The reduced incidence of feeding and fewer prey 
taxa ingested by juvenile herring in 1997 may be a 
response to the lower zooplankton availability.  
Food composition changed from being dominated 
by Larvaceans and small calanoid copepods in the 
fall of 1996 to only small calanoids in 1997.  If the 
densities of prey had been higher in 1997, having 
only small copepods (with higher energy density) 
to eat may have been positive for the condition of 
herring prior to overwintering.  Studies estimating 
the assimilation rates given in situ prey 
compositions found that the smallest juvenile 
herring are liable to fall below basal metabolic 
demands in a year with temperatures similar to 
1996 (Foy and Norcross 1999a).  Warmer 
temperatures in the fall of 1997 increased growth 
rates of juvenile herring (Stokesbury et al. 1999).  
Consequently, herring predation pressure on the 
zooplankton community increased and led to 
lower prey concentrations in the fall.  Lower 
feeding occurrence in the fall caused the herring to 
have a lower fall weight at length than in previous 
years (Stokesbury et al. 1999).  Despite this, 
herring were in better energetic condition in the 
fall of 1997 than in 1996 (Paul and Paul 1998), 
and consequently, a larger number of smaller fish 
survived through the winter of 1997-1998 than in 
1996-1997.  The average length and weight of the 
fish that survived the 1997-1998 winter were 
smaller and lower than in previous years 
(Stokesbury pers. comm.), providing evidence that 
the smallest fish did not die from starvation during 
the winter as has been speculated in previous years 
(Paul et al. 1998; Foy and Paul 1999). 
 
In conclusion, important mechanisms in the 
trophic relationship between herring and 
zooplankton and the environment exist in PWS.  
On seasonal scales, juvenile herring relied heavily 
on prey availability, with greater feeding, diet 
diversity, and opportunistic feeding in the spring 
when zooplankton were abundant.  Seasonal and 
spatial fluctuations in temperature and its 
influence on zooplankton were important at this 
time.  On diel scales, juvenile herring relied on 
vertical migration for greater prey overlap and 
higher diet diversity from 1600 to 2359h when the 
light levels were decreased.  Juvenile herring 
switched to selective feeding from 0000 to 0759h 
when large calanoid copepods were present in the 
water column.  Furthermore, we suggest that lower 
prey availability affects the feeding dynamics of 
juvenile herring.  Evidence suggests that 
environmental conditions may have affected the 
prey resource base for herring in 1997.  
103
Consequently, herring growth rates increased and 
the energy density of herring was high by fall 
1997.  However, we hypothesize that a 
combination of lower feeding in the fall and warm 
winter temperatures meant that the average 
condition of surviving fish in the spring was lower 
than previous years.

Dynamics of Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring growth rate and zooplankton 
biomass (Sea of Japan)

The Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring population has 
been in low abundance for several decades  
(Fig. 24).  Fish growth rates, including herring, are 
closely connected with the state of population.  A 
negative relationship between fish size and 
population abundance has been observed for 
Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring (Kitahama 1955; 
Motoda and Hirano, 1963). 
 
On the whole, relatively low growth rates of 
Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring were recorded from 
1955-1970 and 1990-1998, and much higher 
growth rates from 1970-1990.  A comparison of 
the parameters of regression equations for linear 
growth of feeding herring during 1955-1959 and 
1991 did not show certain differences (at P=0.05).  
Such regularity was marked both for immature and 
adult fish.  The increase in growth rate during the 
1970-1980s seemed to be due to a great decrease 
in abundance, but in the 1990s, a decrease in mean 
length and a further reduction of herring 
abundance and their main food competitors 
(walleye pollock, sardine) were recorded. 
 
Fish growth is dependent on many factors 
including zooplankton abundance.  The mean 
length fluctuations for Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring 
during 1955-1998, appeared to correspond to 
fluctuations of total zooplankton biomass in the 
area of feeding along southwestern Sakhalin coast.  
Herring growth rate did not vary much with year-
class strength, but seemed to follow in parallel 
with fluctuations of total zooplankton biomass 
(Figs. 25 and 26).  A supply with food organisms 
is perhaps one of the factors limiting herring 
growth in periods of low abundance.

We have been sampling off Newport Oregon on a 
biweekly basis since 1996, at stations located 1 
and 5, 10 and 15 miles from shore.  At each 
station, a CTD profile is taken, surface seawater 
samples are collected with a bucket for later 
analysis of chlorophyll and nutrients, and a 
vertical plankton tow is taken with a 1/2 m 
diameter 202 mesh nets.  From these samples, we 
106
have counted all zooplankton including euphausiid 
larval stages.  In this brief paper, we discuss the 
data on euphausiid furcilia larvae from the station 
five miles (9 km) from shore.  This station is 
designated as NH05 on the figures shown below. 
 
Two species dominate the euphausiid assemblage 
off Oregon, Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa 
spinifera.  Under “normal” ocean conditions, E. 
pacifica dominates offshore waters and T. 
spinifera shelf waters.  We have found that this 
pattern of dominance varies depending upon 
physical conditions –T. spinifera dominates 
nearshore waters only during years of strong 
upwelling;  during summers of weak upwelling, E. 
pacifica moves into shelf waters in significant 
numbers.  Figure 27 illustrates this pattern for the 
May-September growth season.  Weak upwelling 
years were 1996, 1997 and 1998; strong upwelling 
years were 1999 and 2000.  During 1996, though 
T. spinifera dominated, there were significant 
numbers of E. pacifica furcilia present in shelf 
waters.  During 1997, abundances of furcilia 
larvae of T. spinifera and E. pacifica were equal 
but in 1998, during the El Niño, E. pacifica was 
the dominant species.

Oregon).  Note that Euphausia pacifica, an 
oceanic species, were abundant from 1996-1998, 
and were the dominant species during the 1997-98 
El Niño period.  From spring 1999 until present, 
the coastal species, Thysanoessa spinifera, is the 
dominant form. 
 
Also apparent in the data in Figure 27 is the long-
term trend in declining abundances of T. spinifera 
from 1996-1998, followed by a trend toward 
increasing numbers in 1999 and 2000.  E. pacifica 
showed the opposite pattern of increasing numbers 
from 1996-1998, then a decline to very low levels 
in 1999 and 2000.  The same data are shown as a 
time series in Figure 28.

Fig. 29 Changes in spawning season of euphau-
siids at a station five miles off Newport, Oregon.  
In 1996-1998, spawning occurred only in late 
summer.  Spawning times in 1999 and 2000 were 
greatly expanded and included major spawning in 
the spring and early summer months as well. 
 
107
Another feature of euphausiid ecology that has 
shown significant change in the past five years is 
the length of the spawning season.  We have found 
that the spawning season at NH05 in 1996-1998 
was very short, lasting only a few weeks in July 
and August (Fig. 29).  Beginning in 1999, the 
spawning season was extended from April through 
September.  Euphausiid egg densities averaged 
over the summer also increased greatly and by 
2000, numbers greater than 300 per cubic meter on 
average were seen.  This compared to 1996-1998, 
when average abundances were approximately 20, 
40 and 2 per cubic meter respectively.  We do not 
know which species of which euphausiid produced  
these eggs because we have only recently been 
able to identify the eggs to species.  We do know 
that the eggs in 2000 were T. spinifera but we will 
have to re-count the other samples to determine 
the relative abundances of T. spinifera and E. 
pacifica eggs.  Given the inter-annual variability in 
dominance, we expect to find a dominance of T. 
spinifera eggs in 1996 and 1999, and E. pacifica 
eggs in 1997 and 1998. 
 
 
Modeling environmental and predation-induced variability in euphausiid 
recruitment:  Its dependence and impact on herring trophodynamics

The interaction between predation and 
zooplankton recruitment processes in determining 
the availability of euphausiid prey for adult Pacific 
herring, Clupea pallasi, was investigated.  
Variability in euphausiid recruitment is influenced 
by the magnitude of spawning input, environ-
mentally induced variability in larval survivorship 
and development, as well as by predation on early 
life-history stages.  Previous life-history modelling 
of euphausiid larval development has underscored 
how heterogeneity in the developmental environ-
ment can have more pronounced effects during 
particular stages of the euphausiid larval ontogeny 
and disproportionately influence subsequent 
recruitment (Rumsey and Franks 1999).   
 
In this modelling work, however, I focus on the 
role of herring predation in determining variability 
in euphausiid abundances.  Herring predation can 
impact euphausiid demography directly through 
consumption.  Additionally, predation effects on 
euphausiids can be delayed, or indirect, by 
affecting adult abundance through predation on 
developing larvae, and by impacting larval 
euphausiids through predation on adults and 
subsequently diminishing the magnitude of 
spawning.  Furthermore, I investigate the potential 
feedback on juvenile and adult herring of changes 
in their zooplankton prey preferences.  Although 
copepods often dominate the diets of juvenile 
Pacific herring in the Eastern Pacific (Ivashina and 
Bragina 1999; Radchenko and Dulepova 1999), 
juvenile and larval euphausiids are often 
represented in stomach contents, and thus juvenile 
prey could potentially impact adult herring food 
availability. 
 
A simple ecosystem model was developed to 
evaluate the impact of herring prey preferences on 
zooplankton dynamics, as well as that of juvenile 
(0+ age class) and adult (>3+ age class) herring.  
Juvenile herring prey consisted of varying 
proportions of copepod larvae, copepod adults, 
and euphausiid larvae.  Adult herring prey were 
comprised of adult copepods and/or euphausiids 
(Fig. 30).  The effect of predation was investigated 
by manipulating juvenile and adult herring prey-
preference values, and monitoring the impact on 
the model state variables (e.g. the abundances of 
copepod, euphausiid and herring adults and 
larvae/juveniles).  Additionally, the impact on 
state variables of variations in the initial values of 
model parameters was determined, and compared 
with the manipulations of herring prey preference.  
This comparison provides insights into how 
predation mediated changes in state variables 
compare with environmentally forced changes.  
The results of these analyses are reported as 
108
elasticities, or proportional effect on a given state 
variable for a given proportional manipulation of a 
model parameter.  Elasticity values facilitate the 
comparison of parameters that differ in their units 
of measure and/or magnitude.  Additionally, 
elasticities provide a robust statistic for the 
analysis of model results in spite of poorly 
constrained parameter values. 
 
The response of zooplankton and herring 
abundances was most pronounced for 
manipulations of the initial values of model 
parameters (e.g. Bollens 1988).  This observation 
suggests a greater impact of varying 
environmental conditions (especially primary 
productivity) on herring-zooplankton population 
dynamics than that of herring predation and prey 
preferences (Fig. 31). 
 
Although not as pronounced as the initial value 
elasticities, elasticity values for varying herring 
prey preference produced as much as a 30% 
variation in the output of modeled zooplankton

populations.  The influence of herring predation on 
modeled adult euphausiid abundance was 
primarily the result of direct predation by adult 
herring.  The abundance of larval euphausiids, 
however, was controlled indirectly through 
predation on adult euphausiids and subsequent 
impacts on reproductive output  (Fig. 32).  Similar 
to the results for adult euphausiids, modelled 
copepod abundance was influenced directly by 
herring predation (Fig. 33).

Increased prey preference for copepod prey 
resulted in diminished adult herring abundance, 
indicating a cost associated with broader diet 
choice (Fig. 34, left).  No such cost, however, was  
associated with changing prey preferences for 
juvenile herring (Fig. 34, right).  Although 
juvenile herring benefited by increased predation 
on euphausiid larvae, there appears to be little 
indirect impact on adult herring through the 
reduction of their adult euphausiid prey (e.g. 
McGurk et al. 1993).

Judging from the fluctuation of the catch data, the 
stock condition of herring populations around 
Japan are in different phases.  Hokkaido-Sakhalin 
population spawn in high salinity shallow waters, 
the life span is longer than 15 years, and migration 
range is wide within these populations.  Annual 
catch had been maintained at more than three 
hundred thousand tons from the 1880s to the mid-
1930s, with a historical peak of about one million 
tons in 1897.  However the catch declined since 
the mid-1940s, and has been still at quite a low 
level since 1955, except the appearance of the 
1983 year-class which was caught totally about 
one hundred thousand tons.  The Mangoku-Ura 
110
population spawn in high salinity waters but 
migration range is smaller and life span is shorter 
than the Hokkaido-Sakhalin population.  Its annual 
catch increased gradually from 1977, and reached 
about six hundred tons in 1984.  But it decreased 
since 1987 due to the small recruitment relating to 
the rise of water temperature in the spawning 
season.  For the Lake-Furen population which 
spawn in brackish lake, the annual catch had 
fluctuated below ten tons before 1984.  Since 
1985, it gradually increased and reached about 
seven hundred tons in 1997, but it decreased 
below fifty tons in 1999 and 2000, due to the weak 
year-classes of 1997 and 1998.  Different phases 
of stock condition observed among each 
population may be deeply related to the inherent 
ecological and physiological abilities of adaptation 
to the number of oceanic condition factors. 
 
 
Oil, disease and fishing as factors in the multiple collapses of the Prince 
William Sound herring population

In 1993, the largest biomass of Pacific herring in 
history was predicted to return to Prince William 
Sound to spawn.  Instead, there was a record low 
return.  In the fall of 1993, we conducted an 
echointegration-purse seine assessment of the 
stock that confirmed the stock collapse to 20,000 
metric tons (MT).  After a fall 1993 fishery, 
acoustic surveys showed that the population 
further collapsed to 13,000 MT.  With a 
moratorium on fishing, the population rebuilt to 
23,000 MT and 38,000 MT in the falls of 1995 and 
1996, respectively.  However, the acoustic surveys 
in the springs of 1998 and 1999, after reopening 
the commercial fishery, showed the population to 
have collapsed again to about 17,000 MT.  After 
test fishing in the spring of 1999, management 
cancelled the fishery.  The spring survey 2000 
showed the population to have fallen to a new, all-
time low of 9,000 MT.  Co-occurring with the 
collapses of the herring population in 1993 and 
1997, were outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic 
septicemia.  This suggests that the herring have a 
low immunity to disease after handling by fishing 
operations.  Researchers have suggested the 
possibility of immune-system damage due to oil 
exposure in 1989.  We present infrared 
observations of herring surfacing at night to 
replace air in their gas bladder as a
