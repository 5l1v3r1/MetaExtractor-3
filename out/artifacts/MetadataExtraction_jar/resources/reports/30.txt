1. Introduction 
 
Micronekton are relatively small, but actively 
swimming, organisms ranging in size (2–10 cm) 
between plankton, which mostly drift with the 
currents, to the larger nekton, which have the 
ability to swim freely without being overly 
affected by currents.  Although many 
micronektonic species can be found close to shore 
or near the sea bottom, we consider only those that 
occur in the pelagic realm mainly at the edge of, or 
beyond, the continental shelves.  Many diverse 
taxonomic groups include micronektonic forms 
but the principal groups we examine in this report 
include cephalopods (small species and juvenile 
stages of large oceanic species), crustaceans 
(including large euphausiids, pelagic decapods, 
and mysids), and fishes (mainly mesopelagic 
species and juveniles of pelagic nekton).  
Although not generally fished commercially 
because of their relatively small size, micronekton 
represent a critical, but poorly understood, 
intermediate trophic link between the meso and 
macrozooplankton, and the higher trophic levels, 
including fishes, seabirds, and marine mammals.  
Many studies have shown that micronektonic 
species are a primary food source for a wide 
variety of harvested nektonic species. 
Unfortunately, micronekton are poorly sampled in 
most field studies due to their ability to avoid 
standard plankton sampling gear and their 
extrusion through the mesh of larger fish trawls. 
 
Diel vertical migration of micronekton has been 
shown to contribute significantly to the rapid 
vertical transport of organic material from 
epipelagic to mesopelagic zones, referred to as the 
biological pump (Hidaka et al., 2001 and 
references therein).  Through this biological pump, 
carbon fixed as living organic matter plus 
anthropogenic substances such as insecticides, 
butyltin and PCBs are transported to deep-sea 
ecosystems.  Myctophids have been suggested as 
particularly good monitors of deep-sea pollution 
because they encounter a variety of water masses 
(of different origin) during their substantial diel 
vertical migrations (Takahashi et al., 2000).   
1.1 Working Group History  
 
A need was identified within the PICES 
community, especially among the ecosystem 
modelers, for a synthesis of the available 
information on micronekton in the North Pacific.  
In response, a theme session was held during the 
1997 PICES Annual Meeting in Pusan, Korea, 
which brought together a large number of 
micronekton experts within the North Pacific 
region.  It was at that time that a proposal was put 
forth to the Biological Oceanography Committee 
(BIO) to establish a PICES working group to 
assimilate knowledge of micronekton and their 
sampling in the North Pacific.  This led to the 
formation of Working Group 14 (WG 14) on 
“Effective Sampling of Micronekton to Estimate 
Ecosystem Carrying Capacity” in 1998.  Although 
organizational meetings were held at PICES 
Annual Meetings in 1998 in Fairbanks, U.S.A. and 
1999 in Vladivostok, Russia, there were 
difficulties getting co-chairmen and members to 
attend these meetings.  Membership for the 
Working Group was finalized in 2000, and the 
Working Group met for the first time at PICES IX 
in Hakodate, Japan.  Subsequent Working Group 
meetings were held during PICES Annual 
Meetings in 2001, in Victoria, Canada, and 2002, 
in Qingdao, China, and an intersessional meeting 
was held in winter of 2002, in Honolulu, U.S.A.  
Initial summaries of the sampling conducted by 
each member nation were contained in a report 
presented at the PICES/CoML/IPRC workshop on 
“Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and 
Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes 
in the North Pacific” held in Honolulu in March 
2001 (Brodeur, 2001a) and have been included in 
this report as Appendix Tables.   
 
Prior to the 2000 Annual Meeting in Hakodate, the 
Working Group co-sponsored a symposium 
entitled “Advanced Techniques of Sampling Gear 
and Acoustic Surveys for Estimation of Fish 
Abundance and Behavior” which has since been 
published electronically (Iida, 2003).  During the 
2002 PICES Annual Meeting in Qingdao, three 
members of the Working Group (Drs. John  
 
2 
Dower, Richard Brodeur and Orio Yamamura) 
organized a special theme session on “The 
Importance of Biophysical Coupling in 
Concentrating Marine Organisms around Shallow 
Topographies”.  Many of these papers dealt 
primarily with micronekton and were useful in 
preparing this report.  Several of the papers 
presented during this symposium were 
subsequently submitted to a special volume of 
Journal of Marine Systems and were published in 
2004 (Dower and Brodeur, 2004). 
The following report synthesizes what is known 
about the distribution and trophic relationships of 
micronekton in the North Pacific Ocean and 
adjacent seas, with a summary of the present state 
of sampling of these organisms.  The report is not 
meant to be all-inclusive but merely to synthesize 
important aspects based on the literature and the 
knowledge of the Working Group, and to identify 
key knowledge gaps that should be filled in the 
coming years.

2. Species Composition and Distribution Patterns Related to Water Masses 
 
2.1 Mesopelagic Fishes 
 
2.1.1 Dominant families 
In the subarctic and transitional regions, fishes of 
the families Myctophidae and Microstomatidae are 
the most abundant in terms of number and 
biomass, accounting from 80% to more than 90% 
of total micronektonic fish catch, while in the 
subtropical waters, Myctophidae, Gonostomatidae, 
and Phosichthydae comprise most of the total 
catch (Gjøsaeter and Kawaguchi, 1980; Beamish 
et al., 1999).  Although occasionally found in deep 
fjords or inland seas (e.g., Mason and Phillips, 
1985; Abookire et al., 2002), the vast majority of 
micronektonic species are found along the 
continental or insular slope regions, and around 
the seamount areas of the North Pacific.  Slope 
water species are mainly myctophids and 
sternoptychids which occur adjacent to insular or 
continental shelves and seamounts in the 
transition, subtropical and tropical regions. 
Considering these family compositions, we 
reviewed the common species of these two 
families in the subarctic and transitional waters, 
three families in the subtropical waters, and two 
families in the slope waters of the North Pacific. 
Rare species of taxonomic interest were not 
treated in this report because of their low biomass. 
  
2.1.2 Large-scale feeding and/or spawning 
migration or expatriation? 
 
When examining the distribution of these families, 
the most remarkable feature is that, with the 
exception of a few species (see Table 2.1), most of 
the subarctic waters are not utilized as spawning 
grounds.  For example, all of the myctophids 
hitherto classified as subarctic species (based on 
adult distribution) spawn in warmer transitional 
waters including the Transition Domain and 
Transition Zone and Subtropical waters (see Fig. 
5.1).  In the case of Notoscopelus japonicus, a 
typical transitional water species found off Japan, 
its spawning ground is located in the upstream 
region of the Kuroshio Current off southern Japan, 
and the larvae are transported northward to the 
transitional waters off northern Japan (Sassa et al., 
2004a).  The larvae of Lipolagus ochotensis, the 
adults of which are common in the Bering Sea, 
also occur in the subtropical waters of the 
Kuroshio and in the warm waters of the California 
Current (Moser et al., 1993; Moser and Ahlstrom, 
1996; Sassa et al., 2004a).  Although it has never 
been studied in detail, scattered evidence suggests 
that some micronektonic mesopelagic fishes may 
undertake spawning and feeding migrations of up 
to 1000 km (Sassa et al., 2004a).  Balanov and 
Il’insky (1992) estimated that there were about 2.8 
million tons of myctophid and 0.31 million tons of 
Lipolagus ochotensis biomass in the Bering Sea. 
Their larvae are known to occur in the California 
Current region, the Transition Domain and Alaska 
Current waters in the eastern North Pacific, as well 
as in the transition and Kuroshio regions of the 
western North Pacific (Fig. 2.1; Abookire et al., 
2002; Moser and Ahlstrom, 1996; Funes-
Rodríguez et al., 2000; Zahuranec, 2000). 
However, it is not known whether this biomass 
represents a feeding migratory population in the 
Bering Sea or expatriation from elsewhere.  
Absence or very low density of their larvae in the 
Alaska Current and Alaskan Stream regions does 
not explain the abundance of adults in the Bering 
Sea.  Exact knowledge is essential on this type of 
large-scale migration, or expatriation, in order to 
understand the productivity and fluctuation of 
populations of each micronekton species since the 
significance of myctophids as food for salmonids 
and squids has been suggested (Nagasawa et al., 
1997). Considering these possibilities, we 
reviewed the distribution patterns of both larvae 
and juvenile–adult specimens after metamorphosis 
(hereafter cited as adults) to identify the spawning 
ground of each species in the North Pacific, and to 
discuss expatriation, since previous reviews were 
restricted only to adults. 
  
2.1.3 Definition of water masses  
 
As the distribution patterns of micronektonic 
mesopelagic fish are well correlated with physical 
oceanographic structures, species composition was 
described with respect to the different water 
masses defined here.  The distributions of adult 
specimens of common species are well known, 
based on the several comprehensive reviews and 
studies, as subsequently described.  However, 
4 
knowledge of larval micronekton distributions is 
very limited because of the difficulty in 
identifying many of the early life stages.  We 
selected typical areas (Tables 2.1–2.3) where both 
larval and adult distributions were fairly well 
described in the main water masses and current 
systems hitherto designated.  Oceanographic 
terminology (e.g., current systems, gyres, 
domains, and water masses) adopted in the 
following description of species distributions are 
based on Favorite et al. (1976) unless otherwise 
stated. Their definitions, and physical 
oceanographic features and relationships with 
mesopelagic fish zoogeography are described in 
the next section. 
 
(1)  Subarctic Waters (SAW)  
 
Bering and Okhotsk Seas  
These two geographically semi-enclosed areas  
(Table 2.1) correspond to the Bering Sea Gyre, the 
Bering Sea Current system, the Okhotsk Sea Gyre 
and the Okhotsk Kurile Current system, as defined 
by Favorite et al. (1976).  
Oyashio Waters (OyW) and Western Subarctic 
Waters (WSAW)   
The Oyashio Current is a southward branch of the 
outflow of the Okhotsk Kurile Current and is well 
distinguished from the western Transitional 
Domain waters by the Oyashio Front (OyF), which 
has been defined by the 5°C isotherm and 33.4 
isohaline at 100 m depth off Japan (Kawai, 1972). 
The OyF extends eastward along approximately 
40°N latitude before turning northward to join the 
Subarctic Current near 45°N and 155°E.  The 
WSAW in Table 2.1 includes the Western 
Subarctic Gyre with its related current systems and 
the Subarctic Current System west of 170°E. 
Favorite et al. (1976) proposed that the 4°C 
isotherm at 100 m depth serve as a boundary 
between waters of the Subarctic Current System 
and Transition Domain.  This boundary almost 
coincides with the OyF in the west, since the 4° 
and 5°C isotherms are almost identical in this 
region. 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig.  2.1 Large-scale near surface circulation of the subarctic North Pacific Ocean. (from Favorite et al., 
1976) 
5 
Eastern Subarctic Waters (ESAW)  
The ESAW correspond with the eastern parts of 
both the Subarctic Current System and the Ridge 
Domain.  Associated with the northward shift of 
the 4° and 5°C isotherms at 100 m depth east of 
140°W (Fig. 14 of Favorite et al., 1976), the 
southern limit of the ESAW shifts northward in 
the eastern North Pacific due to the effect of the 
warmer Alaska Current which flows northward 
along the west coast of North America and 
becomes the Alaskan Stream. 
 
(2) Transition Domain (TrD), Transition Zone 
(TrZ) and California Current System 
 
The TrD has been defined as the zone between the 
Subarctic Boundary (SAB) and the southern 
boundary of the Subarctic Current System 
(Fig. 2.1) characterized by 4–5°C isotherm at 100 
m depth. Pearcy (1991) recognized the “Transition 
Zone” as the zone between the SAB and the 
Subtropical Front and named the area, including 
both the Transition Zone and Transition Domain, 
the “transition region”.  Roden (1991) reviewed 
the dynamic aspects of the transition region 
(mainly in the Central Pacific), excluding the 
California Current and Oyashio–Kuroshio 
confluence regions, and defined the TrZ, a 
Subarctic Frontal Zone to the north, and a 
Subtropical Frontal Zone to the south, based on 
the frontal structures of salinity and temperature. 
He indicated that the southern limit of the 
Subarctic Frontal Zone is best defined by the 
surfacing of the 33.8 isohaline.  This means that 
his Subarctic Frontal Zone is not exactly the TrD 
previously designated, since the southern limit of 
the latter was defined by the surfacing of the 34.0 
isohaline (Favorite et al., 1976).  However, the 
two areas are almost identical since the positions 
of the 33.8 and 34.0 isohalines are usually quite 
close.  A recent study in the western North Pacific 
revealed that the SAB is the key front for defining 
the spawning grounds of mesopelagic fishes in 
transitional areas (Sassa, 2001; Sassa et al., 
2004b).  Considering the biological importance 
and the spatio-temporal stability of the SAB, as 
shown in Fig. 34 of Favorite et al. (1976), we 
hereafter adopt the terminology of Favorite et al. 
(1976) and Pearcy (1991). 
In the North Pacific west of 155°E longitude, the 
waters between the OyF and Kuroshio Front 
(KuF) have been called by various terms, such as 
transition waters, Transition Zone, or Ku-Oy 
mixing zone.  The problem is that the above terms 
often include the waters of both the TrD and TrZ, 
which are located on both sides of the SAB, since 
the SAB is always located between the OyF and 
KuF.  This ambiguous terminology, used to 
describe the transition water zoogeography, seems 
to have resulted in considerable confusion in 
scientific discussion.  Considering the significance 
of the SAB as the boundary of larval and adult 
distributions of mesopelagic and harvested fish 
(Mishima, 1981; Sassa et al., 2004b), descriptions 
based on the exact distinction of the above water 
masses are necessary in the western North Pacific. 
 
Transition Domain   
The TrD is continuous from Japan to North 
America (Fig. 2.1).  The southern boundary of the 
TrD is well denoted by the SAB and its location is 
both seasonally and annually stable, corresponding 
well with that of the 34 isohaline at both the 
surface and 100 m depth due to the vertical 
orientation of the 34 isohaline (Fig. 34 of Favorite 
et al., 1976). The SAB is located around 41°N in 
the western part of the TrD (extending eastward to 
160°W), and then gradually turns southward to 
join the offshore region of the California Current 
System. The northern boundary of the TrD is 
denoted by the OyF (determined by the 5°C
 
isotherm at 100 m depth) in the area west of 
approximately 155°E (Kawai, 1972; Susana and 
Sugimoto, 1998).  East of about 155 °E, the 4°C 
isotherm at 100 m depth denotes its northern 
boundary.  East of 160°W, however, the northern 
boundary is delimited by the “Dilute Domain”, 
denoted by the small salinity difference (<2 psu) in 
the upper 100 m depth from the surrounding water 
masses (Favorite et al., 1976).  As this salinity 
difference does not affect mesopelagic fish 
distribution (LeBrasseur, 1970), the Dilute 
Domain was included in the eastern TrD in the 
present description of mesopelagic fish 
zoogeography (Table 2.1).  The same is true for 
the Upwelling Domain from California to British 
Columbia, although upwelling is known to affect 
the offshore–inshore larval distributions off  
 
6 
Oregon (Richardson and Pearcy, 1977).  In other 
words, the TrD in this review expands northward 
into the Alaska Current, and also southward, to 
merge into the California Current regions where 
transitional and subarctic water mesopelagic fishes 
dominate (Table 2.1).  The obvious temperature 
difference between the cold Subarctic Waters 
(SAW) of the Subarctic Current and the warmer 
TrD waters of the Alaska Current was shown in 
the upper 1000-m layer by Favorite et al. (1976). 
The warm TrD nature of the Alaska Current 
gradually decreases northward toward the Alaskan 
Stream region since mesopelagic fish larvae, 
which are abundant in the California Current 
region, also decrease northward.  In the western 
Pacific off Japan, the TrD waters can be as narrow 
as 10–20 km, and sometimes indiscernible because 
of the strong southward intrusion of the Oyashio, 
but become more obvious east of 155°E. 
 
Transition Zone 
In the area west of approximately 170°E, the TrZ 
is located between the SAB and KuF and its 
eastward extension (Subtropical Front) as defined 
by the 15°C isotherm and 34.6 isohaline at 100 m 
near 37–38°N.  The Subtropical Front is deflected 
southward by current–topography interactions 
with the Emperor Seamount chain near 170°E 
(Roden, 1991), becoming diffuse southward to 
30°N.  No discernable front associated with the 
Kuroshio is observed in the central North Pacific 
east of the Emperor Seamount chain.  The 
Subtropical Convergence is located mainly around 
30°N, but is also recognizable around 25°N in the 
western North Pacific.  Therefore, the Subtropical 
Frontal Zone defined by Roden (1991) is used to 
define the southern TrZ boundary in the central 
North Pacific.  Near 160°W, the northern 
boundary of the TrZ (= SAB) is gradually 
deflected southeastward, reaching the area near 
30°N and 130°W where it merges into the offshore 
region of the California Current. 
 
California Current System 
As stated in the TrD section, the eastern TrD 
expands southeastward, together with one branch 
of the Subarctic Current, the upper 250 m of which 
turns southeast near 150°E to merge into the 
California Current System, although this is “an 
overly simplified description of flow in one of the 
most important regions” (Favorite et al., 1976). 
This current system borders the subtropical 
Eastern North Pacific Central Waters to the west 
and the eastern Pacific Tropical Waters to the 
south.  From the viewpoint of mesopelagic fish 
zoogeography, the California Current waters (at 
least its colder shoreward side) show no 
remarkable differences from the eastern TrD 
waters north of the SAB, although the subtropical 
central water and the eastern Tropical Pacific 
components also occur in its western offshore and 
southern boundary regions, respectively.  Both 
larvae and adults of most subarctic and transitional 
water microstomatids and myctophids are 
abundant off California (Moser and Smith, 1993b). 
 
(3) Subtropical Domain or Subtropical Waters 
(STD or STW) 
 
In the area west of approximately 170°E, the STW 
correspond to waters of the Kuroshio Current, the 
Kuroshio Extension and their related warm-core 
rings and streamers dispatched northward into the 
TrZ across the KuF.  The northern boundary 
corresponds with the KuF, and its eastward 
extension is denoted by the 15°C isotherm and 
34.6 isohaline at 100 m depth near 36–37°N.  In 
the central North Pacific, a northern border is 
denoted by the sharp subtropical salinity front 
around 32°N in which 34.6–35.0 isohalines are 
embedded (Roden, 1991).  These waters have been 
often called Eastern North Pacific Central Waters, 
and border the eastern TrZ to the north and the 
California Current System to the east.  
 
(4) Slope Waters 
 
Slope water species belonging to shelf-edge 
assemblages occur in transition and subtropical 
waters over continental and insular slopes (e.g., 
the Kuroshio Current and transition region off 
Japan, off Hawaii, the Emperor Seamount region, 
and off southern California) (Table 2.3).  They 
also occur in the tropical slope waters of the Indo-
Pacific region, but are absent in subarctic waters 
(except for its southernmost areas).

2.1.4 Species composition 
 
Typical species compositions of both larvae and 
adults are summarized by water mass in Tables 2.l 
to 2.3.  After metamorphosis, juveniles (especially 
Stenobrachius leucopsarus, Diaphus theta, 
Protomyctophum thompsoni and Lipolagus 
ochotensis) are considered adults.  The 
zoogeographic species groups listed in Tables 2.1 
and 2.2 are based on the adult distributions as 
presently known (Rass, 1954; Parin, 1961, 1988; 
Aron, 1962; Pearcy, 1964; Pearcy et al., 1979b; 
Ahlstrom, 1969; Parin and Fedorov, 1981; Bekker, 
1967, 1983; Willis, 1984; Willis et al., 1988; 
Balanov and Il’Insky, 1992; Beamish et al., 1999). 
Species identified in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 as 
“transpacific” are those that are distributed in both 
the western and eastern sides of the subarctic, 
transitional and subtropical waters.  Adult and 
larval distribution patterns in the transition region 
of the Central Pacific are restricted (Norcross et 
al., 2003).  The distribution patterns of each 
species group are as follows. 
 
(1) Subarctic–Transition Water species 
 
Transpacific Subarctic–Transition Water (SAW–
TrW) species   
Adults of this group are known to be widely 
distributed in the eastern, central and western 
subarctic and transition waters, including both the 
TrZ and TrD, and California Current waters, and 
partly extend their distribution into the Bering and 
Okhotsk Seas (Table 2.1).  However, their larval 
distributions are centered in the transition and 
California Current waters.  In the western Pacific, 
larval Stenobrachius leucopsarus, Diaphus theta 
and Nannobrachium regale are restricted mainly 
to the TrZ waters, while the larvae of 
Stenobrachius nannochir and Protomyctophum 
thompsoni occur in TrD waters, and are frequently 
found in the northern boundary area of the TrZ 
(Sassa, 2001; Sassa et al., 2004a). The larvae of 
Leuroglossus schmidti occur in the western and 
eastern SAW and Bering Sea (Sobolevsky and 
Sokolovskaya, 1996; Dunn, 1983) and the 
southern Okhotsk Sea (Savinykh, pers. observ.).  
Although L. schmidti larvae were sometimes 
recorded in the California Current north of 35°N 
(Moser et al., 1994), it has not been recorded near 
Oregon, indicating that spawning occurs mainly in 
subarctic waters north of 50°N. 
 
In the eastern Pacific, the greatest number of 
larvae in this group is distributed mainly in the 
TrD and the California Current region north or 
northeast of the SAB (Moser et al., 1993, 1994; 
Moser and Smith, 1993a,b; Norcross et al., 2003). 
However, the number of larval species decreases 
northward from Oregon (Richardson and Pearcy, 
1977; Richardson et al., 1980; Doyle et al., 2002) 
to the Alaskan Gyre systems (LeBrasseur, 1970; 
Dunn and Naplin, 1974; Frost and McCrone, 
1979).  Norcross et al. (2003) examined larval fish 
distributions from vertically stratified tows along a 
north–south transect at 158°W in winter and found 
four species of myctophids in the Subarctic 
Domain (we note that their Subarctic Domain 
south of 50°N (stations NH17-27) is identified as 
the TrD according to the definition in this review, 
and so their results agree with the findings of the 
present evaluation).  The larvae of four species, 
S. leucopsarus, P. thompsoni, L. schmidti, and 
Tarletonbeania crenularis, occur in the Alaskan 
Gyre systems including the Alaska Current, 
Alaska Stream, Ridge Domain, and Subarctic 
Current waters (Table 2.1).  Nishimura et al. 
(1999) reported juvenile S. leucopsarus of 22 mm 
SL (i.e., just after metamorphosis) in the 
southeastern Bering Sea, indicating that larval 
transport probably occurred from the south 
through the Alaska Stream.  In midwater trawling 
in the eastern Bering Sea, Sinclair and Stabeno 
(2002) caught high numbers of Microstomatidae 
(mainly L. schmidti, Bathylagus pacificus and 
Pseudobathylagus milleri) and Myctophidae 
(S. leucopsarus and S. nannochir).  The 
distribution patterns of these adults and larvae 
raise the question of whether most of the huge 
mesopelagic fish biomass in the SAW, especially 
in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas, represents 
expatriate or feeding/migratory populations, since 
Balanov and Il’Insky (1992) estimated the biomass 
of myctophids to be approximately 2.8 million 
tons in the Bering Sea.

Transpacific Transitional Water (TrW) species  
Two species, Symbolophorus californiensis and 
Protomyctophum crockeri, occur in both the 
eastern and western Pacific TrW, although their 
populations may be discontinuous.  Adults of this 
group show transpacific distribution in the 
transitional region including both the TrD and 
TrZ, and sometimes enter the southern edge of the 
SAW.  In the western Pacific, larvae of 
S. californiensis occur only in TrZ waters south of 
the SAB, while in the eastern Pacific, their larvae 
are common in both the TrD and California 
Current regions (Moser et al., 1993; 2001; Sassa, 
2001; Norcross et al., 2003; Sassa et al., 2004b).   
 
Western Subarctic–Transitional Water (SAW–
TrW) species 
Adults of this species group are distributed in the 
SAW, TrD and TrZ of the western Pacific west of 
about 175°E (Table 2.1, Sassa et al., 2002b). 
Occasional records from the eastern Pacific are 
likely due to infrequent transport by the Subarctic 
Current System.  Lampanyctus jordani extends its 
distribution into the Bering and Okhotsk Seas 
(Kulikova, 1960).  Of the five species in this 
group, the larvae of Tarletonbeania taylori and 
Lampanyctus jordani occur in the TrD waters and 
northern TrZ close to the SAB.  However, 
Notoscopelus japonicus larvae occur in the 
western STW of the Kuroshio region off southern 
Japan, which suggests a large-scale spawning 
migration of this species on the order of 1,000 
kilometers (Sassa et al., 2004b).  Larvae of 
Diaphus gigas and Melanolagus bericoides have 
not yet been described.  It has been pointed out 
that D. gigas might actually be oversized senile 
expatriates of the subtropical water species 
D. perspicillatus (Kawaguchi and Shimizu, 1978). 
 
Eastern Subarctic–Transitional Water (SAW–
TrW) species  
Adults of five species (T. crenularis, 
Nannobrachium ritteri, Melanolagus bericoides, 
Bathylagus wesethi, and Leuroglossus stilbius) 
occur in both the California Current and TrD 
waters off Oregon (Table 2.1) and several have 
extended distributions through the Alaska Current 
region into the Bering Sea.  Larvae of all but 
M. bericoides occur in the California Current

* Restricted to waters east of ca. 160°E;  ** south of 50°N along 158°E in the eastern Transitional Domain waters (sensu Favorite et al., 1976 after

region (Moser et al., 1993, 1994; Doyle et al., 
2002), while two occur off Oregon (Richardson 
and Pearcy, 1977; Richardson et al., 1980) up to 
the Alaskan Current (LeBrasseur, 1970).  Only 
one species (T. crenularis) occurs in the Alaskan 
Stream region off Kodiak Island (Dunn and 
Naplin, 1974; Norcross et al., 2003) and none 
have been reported from the Bering Sea.  Larvae 
of B. bericoides are abundant in the tropical and 
subtropical eastern Pacific but rare in the 
California Current sampling region (Moser and 
Ahlstrom, 1996). 
 
Variability in use of the Transition Zone (TrZ) and 
Transition Domain (TrD) as spawning grounds   
In the eastern North Pacific, the TrZ waters south 
or southwest of the SAB are mainly dominated by 
adults of the subtropical central water species 
(Willis, 1984), while the TrZ of the western 
Pacific is dominated by the subarctic and 
transitional water species (Sassa et al., 2004a). 
The larvae of transpacific SAW and TrW species 
which occur in the TrZ in the western Pacific are 
distributed in TrD and California Current regions 
in the eastern Pacific (Table 2.1), that is, the use of 
western Pacific TrZ waters as spawning grounds 
of both subarctic and transitional water species 
seems to be replaced by the use of TrD and 
California Current waters north or northeast of the 
SAB in the eastern Pacific (Table 2.1).  This 
northward shift of spawning grounds crossing the 
SAB is probably explained by the warmer 
temperature of the TrD in the upper 300 m layer.  
The long-term mean temperatures at 125 m and 
300 m depth are 2–3°C and 3–5°C higher, in 
summer and winter respectively, in the eastern 
TrD than in the western part (Fig. 35 of Favorite et 
al., 1976). 
 
(2) Tropical–Subtropical species  
 
Transpacific Subtropical–Tropical Water (STW–
TW) species 
Common species belonging to the three most 
abundant families (in terms of both biomass and 
abundance) are listed in Table 2.2.  Based on 
larval occurrence, all of these species are thought 
to spawn in the Subtropical Central Gyre (Clarke, 
1973, 1987; Loeb, 1979a,b, 1980, 1986; Norcross 
et al., 2003) and the Kuroshio waters (Ozawa, 
1986a,b; Sassa, 2001; Sassa et al., 2002a, 
2004b,c).  In the western North Pacific, both 
adults and larvae rarely occur in the TrD, although 
they are occasionally found in the TrZ south of the 
SAB where they are probably related to the 
dynamic interaction between Kuroshio and 
Oyashio waters (e.g., warm streamers and warm-
core rings).  In the North Pacific east of about 
150°W, the distribution of subtropical central 
water species extends eastward into the warmer 
offshore region of the California Current System 
where they have been collected in offshore 
California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries 
Investigations (CalCOFI) samples (Moser and 
Alhstrom, 1996; Moser et al., 1987, 1993, 1994, 
2001).  They do not, however, occur in the colder 
waters off Oregon (Richardson and Pearcy, 1977; 
Richardson et al., 1980).  In general, gonostomatid 
larvae are found more commonly in warmer 
waters than myctophid larvae, and both are absent 
from the colder TrD.  However, adults of non-
vertically migrating gonostomatids, such as 
Cyclothone spp., extend northward into SAW.  
The deepest dweller, Cyclothone atraria, is 
distributed in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas, while 
C. pallida and C. pseudopallida occur in the 
Bering Sea (Beamish et al., 1999; Sinclair and 
Stabeno, 2002). 
 
Western Tropical and Subtropical Water (WTW 
and WSTW) species  
Both the adults and larvae of three myctophid 
species (Diaphus kuroshio, D. garmani, and 
D. perspicillatus) and one gonostomidid (Sigmops 
gracile) are distributed in the Kuroshio and 
Western North Pacific Central Waters, and enter 
partly into the TrZ in association with warm core 
rings and warm streamers from the Kuroshio Front 
(Table 2.2).  Only adult S. gracile extend their 
distribution into the TrD, and farther north into the 
Bering and Okhotsk Seas (Beamish et al., 1999; 
Sinclair and Stabeno, 2002).

Eastern Tropical and Subtropical Water (ETW and

Both the adults and larvae of five species 
(Triphoturus mexicanus, Ceratoscopelus 
townsendi, Diogenichthys laternatus, Cyclothone 
signatha and Vinceguerria lucetia occur in the 
eastern Tropical Pacific and southern California 
Current region, but are absent in the Eastern North 
Pacific Central Waters (Table 2.2).  Adults of 
C. signatha extend their distribution into the 
Bering Sea and are distributed in both eastern and 
western subarctic waters with a sharp westward 
decrease in abundance (Beamish et al., 1999), 
which is probably due to transport by the Alaska 
Current and Alaska Stream. 
 
(3) Slope Water species 
 
Fishes of this group form local high-density 
schools and serve as important prey of higher 
trophic levels resident in slope regions.  Their 
productivity is believed to be very high, reflecting 
the generally high productivity of shelf-edge or 
slope waters.  No slope water species are found in 
the subarctic regions.  Common species are listed 
in Table 2.3.  Ten species occur from the Japanese 
slope waters, all of which have their distribution 
centers in the subtropical and tropical waters off 
central Japan to the Southeast Asian Seas in the 
Indo-Pacific regions (Kawaguchi, 1977; 
Kawaguchi and Shimizu, 1978; Gjøsaeter and 
Kawaguchi, 1980; Zhenran, 1983).  Of these ten 
species, six (Myctophum brachygnathos, 
Benthosema fibulatum, Diaphus chrysorhynchus, 
D. adenomus, Idiolychnus urolampus and 
Maurolicus japonicus) also occur in the Hawaiian 
slope waters (Wisner, 1976; Reid et al., 1991), and 
five species are known from the Emperor 
Seamount region (Kodolov and Gavrilov, 1980). 
Furthermore, Japanese and Hawaiian slope waters 
are inhabited by two sibling species (i.e., 
Myctophum orientale–M. selenops and Diaphus 
suborbitale–D. trachops) although the status of 
these as species remains controversial.  
Maurolicus had long been a monospecific genus 
represented only by M. muelleri, but has recently 
been divided into 15 species occupying mainly 
slope waters throughout the world (Parin and

separation are still controversial.  The biomass of 
M. imperatorius is substantial (Boehlert et al., 
1994; Sassa et al., 2002b).  The distribution of the 
same, or closely related, sibling species in the 
slope waters off Japan, Hawaii and the Emperor 
Seamount areas would be a result of transport by 
the Kuroshio Current and its extension. 
Benthosema panamense, off California, is closely 
related to B. pterotum, which occurs off Japan, and 
is one of the two slope water species presently 
known from the California Current region 
(Wisner, 1976).  No mesopelagic fishes have been 
recorded from the Yellow Sea (Yoon, unpubl. 
data).

shrimps and mysids rank next to the myctophids in 
terms of micronekton biomass in oceanic waters 
(Aizawa and Marumo, 1967; Blackburn, 1968; 
Blackburn et al., 1970; Omori, 1974a,b; Maynard 
et al., 1975; Pearcy, 1976; Pearcy et al., 1977; 
Hopkins and Lancraft, 1984; Nishikawa et al., 
2001).  Nicol (2003) believes that considering the 
juvenile and adult euphausiids (larvae fit well in 
the conventional definition of plankton) as part of 
the plankton is one of the major impediments to 
the more general understanding of the biology and 
ecology of all species. Although larger 
euphausiids behave as micronekton, historically 
they have been studied as zooplankton, using 
techniques developed for animals which are orders 
of magnitude smaller than them. 
 
2.2.1 Euphausiids  
 
Euphausiids comprise the bulk of the micronekton 
community at most Northeast Pacific continental 
shelf and upper continental slope locations.  The 
distribution and biology of Pacific euphausiids has 
been thoroughly described (Brinton, 1962; 
Ponomareva, 1963, 1990; Nemoto, 1966; 
Mauchline and Fisher, 1969; Gopalakrishnan, 
1974; Brinton, 1975; Mauchline, 1980; Nicol and 
Endo, 1997; Brinton et al., 2000; Everson, 2000).  
Fifty-six of the 86 known euphausiid species have 
been recorded in the North Pacific (20 to 60°N). 
About 48 of these species are found along the 
Asiatic coast and 53 of them along North 
American coast, but most have transpacific 
distributions (Table 2.4).  The neritic species 
restricted to the western North Pacific are 
Euphausia nana (endemic), Pseudeuphauisa 
sinica (endemic), and P. latifrons; the species 
restricted to the eastern North Pacific are the 
neritic Nyctiphanes simplex, the tropical species 
Euphausia distinguenda, E. eximia, E. lamelligera, 
and Nematoscelis gracilis (endemic in the eastern 
Tropical Pacific, but having a temporal northward 
intrusion up to California (31°N) during warming 
episodes) (Baker et al., 1990; Brinton et al., 2000). 
The overall distribution range for several rare 
species is difficult to determine because relatively 
little information has been obtained for meso and 
bathypelagic euphausiids. For example, 
Thysanopoda minyops was described in 1987 in 
the California and Central Pacific regions 
(Brinton, 1987), and only on two other occasions 
has it been recorded again, most recently south of 
Madagascar (Casanova, 1996).  Thysanoessa 
spinifera has most of its distribution in the eastern 
Pacific but has also been recorded in the north 
(50–60°N) as far as 170°E, perhaps as expatriates.  
Species of the genera Bentheuphausia and 
Thysanopoda are primarily mesopelagic and 
bathypelagic.  Some giant individuals (total length 
from 120–150 mm) are considered completely 
nektonic, and usually display cosmopolitan or 
circumglobal distributions due to the absence of 
physico–chemical barriers to their movements 
(Nemoto et al., 1977).  However, along the 
continental shelf of both continents only a few 
species (usually no more than three, and including 
at least one neritic species) dominate in the 
abundance and biomass of those ecosystems.  The 
maximum total length of epipelagic euphausiids in 
the North Pacific ranges from 7–65 mm, and 17 
species reach a maximum total length usually 
between 20–30 mm.  Most species of the genus 
Thysanopoda are usually larger than 32 mm 
(Baker et al., 1990).  However, the two species of 
Pseudeuphausia, most of the species in the genus 
Stylocheiron, and some species in the genera 
Euphausia, Thysanoessa, Nematoscelis, and 
Nyctiphanes (26 species) are all generally ≤18 mm 
and are, therefore, considered primarily 
planktonic.  It is interesting to note that smaller 
euphausiid species, like other pelagic crustaceans, 
tend to be distributed in lower latitudes.

recorded along the western or eastern North Pacific (Baker et al., 1990; Brinton et al., 2000). 
 
Note:  There are endemic species that are distributed only on one side of the North Pacific (absent), but
several rare species have been significantly undersampled.  Therefore, it is unclear whether these species
really have restricted longitudinal distribution or are mostly oceanic species (absent?).

The dominant micronektonic euphausiids along 
the North American continental margin include 
Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera 
(essentially the entire latitudinal range from the 
Aleutian Islands to the northern part of Baja 
California), T. inermis and T. raschi (mostly north 
of 50°N), and T. inspinata and T. longipes (north 
of 40°N).  Several species are largely confined to 
continental margin regions.  Nyctiphanes simplex 
usually occurs south of 30°N along Baja 
California and Gulf of California, where close to 
the coast this single species accounts about 95% of 
the euphausiid biomass (Gómez-Gutiérrez, 1995; 
Gómez-Gutiérrez et al., 1995; Lavaniegos, 1994, 
1995).  This species has been reported as far north 
as 46°N during 1982–83 (Brodeur, 1986) and in 
Canadian waters at 48°54′N during 1997–98 
(Tanasichuk and Cooper, 2002), which were both 
extreme warming episodes (El Niño).  Four 
additional species are either primarily (T. inermis 
and T. spinifera) or entirely (T. raschi and 
N. simplex) restricted to the continental shelf and 
closely adjoining deep oceans in more northern 
areas.  Although the remaining species have much 
broader distributions, extending westward long 
distances into or across the Pacific, their highest 
abundance and biomass are often found along the 
continental shelf break and slope.  
 
It is important to note that E. pacifica is, by far, 
the best studied euphausiid in the North Pacific, 
comparable with Meganyctiphanes norvegica in 
the Atlantic and Euphausia superba in the 
Antarctic. Euphausia pacifica has been 
extensively studied in most aspects of its biology 
and ecology, including morphology, ontogenesis, 
fecundity, egg and larval development, hatching 
mechanisms, feeding, growth, respiration, carbon 
utilization, excretion, swimming behavior, diel 
vertical migration, as prey of higher trophic 
predators, parasitism, population dynamics, 
distribution and abundance, secondary 
productivity, and evolution (Lasker, 1966; Smiles 
and Pearcy, 1971; Brinton, 1962, 1976; Johnson 
and Brinton, 1963; Ross, 1981; Ross et al., 1982; 
Suh et al., 1991; Iguchi and Ikeda, 1994, 1999; 
Iguchi et al., 1993; Tanasichuk 1998a; Yamamura 
et al., 1998; Croll et al., 1998; Ju and Harvey, 
2002; Taki et al., 2002; Feinberg et al., 2003; De 
Robertis, 2002a,b; De Robertis et al., 2003a,b; 
Gómez-Gutiérrez, 2003b).  This large information 
base, plus its ecological importance, makes 
E. pacifica an excellent species for modeling 
studies (De Robertis, 2002a; Goldthwait, 2004). 
 
Euphausiid species richness increases substantially 
from nearshore to oceanic areas along the western 
and eastern Pacific coasts, usually with an abrupt 
increase immediately seaward of the shelf break 
(Gómez-Gutiérrez et al., 2005).  Zoogeography, 
vertical distribution, and speciation of euphausiids 
in the Pacific Ocean are well summarized by 
Brinton (1962, 1967, 1975) and Gopalakhrisnan 
(1974). Brinton et al. (2000) summarized 
information concerning all 86 euphausiid species 
found worldwide and provided maps of their 
zoogeographic distributions, including eco-
phenotypes or “form” distributions.  Net tows 
(Brinton, 1962) and baleen whale gut contents 
(Kawamura, 1982) provide similar pictures of 
large-scale distributional zonation.  The latitudinal 
pattern generally follows the distribution of 
currents and water masses, while species richness 
decreases progressively with increasing latitude 
(Brinton, 1962; Johnson and Brinton, 1963).  For 
example, along the North American coast, the 
number of species decreases from 30–32 between 
28° and 36°N, to 17 species at 46°N, 10–12 
species between 52° and 56°N, and only two 
species at 77°N.  From north to south, the 
sequence of dominant oceanic species is 
Thysanoessa longipes and T. raschi (subarctic 
gyres, especially their northern portions), 
E. pacifica (subarctic gyres and TrZ, but most 
abundant along the boundary between the two), 
and Nematoscelis difficilis and T. gregaria 
(northern transitional, oceanic distribution 
centered along about 40°N).  Local population 
densities are usually lower, by a factor of 2 to 10, 
than along the continental margin (Brinton, 1962) 
but because of the much larger total area, the open 
ocean populations account for the majority of total 
euphausiid biomass (Brinton et al., 2000).  Siegel 
(2000b) reviewed values for abundance and 
biomass of euphausiids, including E. pacifica, 
N. difficilis, T. longipes, and T. spinifera in the 
North Pacific, estimated from net tows or 
acoustics. 
 
The TrZ is between subarctic and central 
populations in the mid-Pacific and between 
17 
subarctic and equatorial populations in the 
California Current System.  From the euphausiid 
zoogeography perspective, this is regarded as a 
biogeographical zone because it harbors: 
(1) endemic species like N. difficilis (35–45°N), 
(2) bi-subtropical species, which are limited by the 
North Pacific to the belt that occurs on each side 
of the tropics (but not within them), such as 
Thysanoessa gregaria or Thysanopoda acutifrons, 
and (3) maximum densities or regions of 
dominance of certain species having broader total 
ranges, like Euphausia gibboides.  This region 
changes in extension according to climatic 
variability at different ecological and geological 
time scales (Brinton, 1962).  The TrZ pattern does 
not fit well into a hypothetical water mass–
population species distribution scheme (Johnson 
and Brinton, 1963).  Features such as rings and 
recirculation cells near the western edge of these 
domains may act to maintain seed populations 
against the flow which can then supply the rest of 
the TrZ.  The system of fronts and eddies that 
characterize the TrZ is thought to be made up of 
zones of episodically enhanced productivity and 
might, therefore, represent an environment with 
high carrying capacity patches (Olson and Hood, 
1994). Those populations would then supply 
individuals upstream to the average flow in 
counter-rotating eddies.  
 
On the western side of the North Pacific, the same 
basic latitudinal pattern of species richness is 
observed, but the distribution of certain species 
(e.g., T. longipes and T. inermis) is displaced 
somewhat farther southward.  The main 
differences in species composition are that 
N. simplex is absent on the western side, 
T. spinifera is mostly distributed in the eastern 
side with a eastern distribution limit of 70°E 
restricted between 50° and 60°N, and Euphausia 
nana, E. similis, Pseudeuphausia latifrons and P. 
sinica occur within the North Pacific only in the 
Kuroshio Current and adjoining regions.  In the 
Okhotsk Sea, T. longipes and T. inermis are 
relatively abundant, followed by T. raschi.  
Euphausia pacifica is found only in the southern 
part of the Okhotsk Sea (Ponomareva, 1963).  In 
the Japan/East Sea, ten species of euphausiids 
have been recorded (Endo and Komaki, 1979), but 
most of these are transported into the southern part 
of the Japan/East Sea by the warm Tsushima 
Current.  The exceptions are E. pacifica (dominant 
over all areas), T. longipes (offshore waters), and 
T. inermis and T. raschi (neritic waters), which are 
all dominant species in the northern part of the 
Japan/East Sea.   
 
In the Kuroshio Current region, including the East 
China Sea, 49 species of euphausiids have been 
recorded.  Euphausia nana and P. latifrons are the 
major species on the continental shelf side in the 
East China Sea, while E. nana and E. similis 
dominate off southern Japan (Hirota, 1995).  Hong 
(1969) reported ten species of euphausiids in 
Korean waters, including E. pacifica, E. nana, 
P. latifrons, E. mutica, E. recurva, E. similis, 
E. tenera, T. longipes, Stylocheiron affine, and 
S. carinatum.  The first three of these were the 
dominant species, while the latter were associated 
mainly with the influx of the Tsushima Current 
and observed only sporadically.  
 
The NAGA Report of Brinton (1975) does not 
include information from Korea and the Yellow 
Sea, showing the distributions of all the 
euphausiids southward and off the east coast of 
Japan, due to lack of sampling in those areas.  
Further studies like Suh (1990) recorded 
Pseudeuphausia sinica for the first time in the 
coastal waters of southwestern Korea.  Cai (1986) 
collected 15 species in the southern Yellow Sea 
and the East China Sea, among which E. pacifica, 
E. nana, P. sinica, and P. latifrons were the most 
abundant species.  Euphausia pacifica and E. nana 
dominated during spring and summer, E. nana and 
P. latifrons in autumn, and E. pacifica and 
P. sinica dominated in winter.  In the central and 
eastern Yellow Sea, four species of euphausiids 
have been recorded, including E. pacifica, 
E. sanzoi, P. latifrons and S. affine (Yoon et al., 
2000). Euphausia pacifica dominated the 
euphausiid community throughout the year, 
representing in some locations within its 
distribution range more than 95% of the total. 
Pseudeuphausia latifrons was observed 
intermittently in the eastern coastal area along the 
Korean Peninsula, and in the southeastern area, 
E. sanzoi and S. affine were rarely collected, their 
temporal distribution seemingly related to the 
influx of the East China Sea water into the Yellow 
Sea.  The distribution of adult E. pacifica was 
determined exclusively by temperature while 
18 
larval distribution was affected by both 
temperature and chlorophyll a concentration.  The 
seasonal appearance of Yellow Sea Cold Bottom 
Water seemed to regulate the distribution of 
E. pacifica.  Interestingly, E. pacifica of the 
Yellow Sea showed genetic differences from its 
congeners of the East (Japan) Sea and the 
California Current (Yoon, unpubl. data).  
 
2.2.2 Mysids and decapods 
 
Among the non-euphausiid crustaceans, large-
scale distribution patterns have been analyzed for 
pelagic decapods (Krygier and Wasmer, 1988) and 
mysids (Mauchline, 1980; Krygier and Murano, 
1988).  Recent studies have compared species 
diversity, zoogeography, and vertical distribution 
of these groups in four geographic regions of the 
North Pacific (Nishikawa et al., 2001; Toczko et 
al., unpubl. MS).   
 
Mysids have been shown to be particularly 
abundant in neritic regions and commonly 
dominate estuaries and shallow regions where they 
play an important role as a key link between 
benthic and pelagic systems in neritic food chains 
(Mauchline, 1980; Wortham-Neal and Price, 
2002).  Thus, few species can be considered truly 
micronektonic.  Dominant species include 
Gnathophausia gigas, Boreomysis californica, and 
Eucopia girmaldii (Krygier and Wasmer, 1988; 
Toczko et al., MS).  Mysid biomass is highest (and 
diversity lowest) in the Bering Sea, while biomass 
and diversity are similar in both the western and 
eastern subarctic.  Dominant decapod crustaceans 
include Hymenodora frontalis, H. gracilis, 
Sergestes similis, and Bentheogennema borealis 
which comprise about 80% of the total biomass 
and number of nektonic pelagic decapods (Krygier 
and Wasmer, 1988; Toczko et al., unpubl. MS).  
Peak biomass of decapods occurs in the western 
subarctic Pacific, but is not significantly different 
from the eastern subarctic Pacific, and is 
associated with warm temperatures and high 
chlorophyll a concentrations.  Species diversity is 
highest in the eastern subarctic and lowest in the 
Bering Sea.  Wicksten (2002) provides 
zoogeographic distribution information for 43 
species of midwater shrimp in the Northeast 
Pacific Ocean.  She notes that the midwater 
shrimps generally have much broader distributions 
and a lower level of endemism than do demersal 
shrimp species.  Aizawa (1974) and Krygier and 
Wasmer (1988) described 27 and 31 species of 
pelagic decapods, respectively, from the western 
subarctic Pacific, most belonging to the families 
Sergestidae and Penaeidae.  Eight species were 
described as trans-subarctic.  In addition, Aizawa 
(1974) reported no distinct seasonal biomass 
fluctuations in his trawl samples, collected from 
1964 to 1968.  A literature review by Krygier and 
Murano (1988) reported the distribution of 31 
species of pelagic mysids in the subarctic North 
Pacific (from a total of 56 mysid species), 11 of 
which were described as cosmopolitan in 
distribution.  From all the mysids recorded in the 
North Pacific, 29 species are restricted to the 
Northeast Pacific, nine are cosmopolitan, eight are 
circumpolar, and six are common to the northern 
North Pacific.  Kikuchi and Nemoto (1986) 
collected 88 species of pelagic shrimps at just 
seven stations off the coast of Japan, which 
suggests a higher diversity in the western Pacific 
Ocean than elsewhere.  
  
In the southern part of the California Current 
System, the pelagic crab Pleuroncodes planipes 
(Galatheidae) forms very high concentrations (>30 
individuals m
–3
 and an estimated biomass of about 
7.8 × 10
5
 metric tons) along the Baja California 
peninsula, and extends its northward distribution 
during El Niño events (Smith, 1985; Aurioles-
Gamboa, 1992; Thompson et al., 1993; Gómez-
Gutiérrez et al., 2000).  During the strong El Niño 
of 1997–1998, several mass strandings of this 
crustacean were observed along central California 
(Gómez-Gutiérrez, unpubl. data).  This is perhaps 
the only benthopelagic galatheid species of 
sufficient abundance to be considered a key 
trophic species in upwelling regions, with the 
potential to support a commercial fishery in the 
North Pacific for biotechnological applications in 
aquaculture and human food additives.

2.3 Cephalopod Micronekton 
  
Zoogeographical patterns of pelagic micronektonic 
cephalopods in the North Pacific can be 
determined from a collection of regional studies. 
For the marginal seas around the basin rim (Nesis 
1973), cephalopod fauna have been reported for 
waters in the Northwest Pacific and around Japan 
(Okutani, 1968; Kubodera and Furuhashi, 1987; 
Okutani et al., 1987; Ivanov, 1997; Shevtsov and 
Mokrin, 1998), the Bering Sea (Jefferts, 1988; 
Radchenko, 1992; Sinclair et al., 1999), the 
Okhotsk Sea (Lapko, 1995), the subarctic (Okutani 
et al., 1988; Kubodera and Jefferts, 1984), the 
Northeast Pacific and Gulf of Alaska (Jefferts, 
1983, 1988), and the eastern Pacific, including the 
California Current System (Young, 1972; Okutani, 
1974; Savinykh, 1999).  In the central North 
Pacific Gyre, cephalopods occupying subtropical 
waters in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands 
(Berry, 1912; Young, 1978), and the subarctic–
subtropical TrZ and associated frontal systems 
have been documented (Seki, 2001).  For 
convenience, we present individual species 
distributions under the appropriate familial 
classification below. 
 
For most of the cephalopod families encountered 
in the micronekton, it is the juvenile and subadult 
forms that are typically represented in net 
sampling, and in the diets of higher-level 
predators.  For example, in boreal waters juvenile 
and subadult forms of the family Gonatidae 
dominate the cephalopod component of the 
micronekton (Jefferts, 1988) and represent key 
forage species for numerous fishes, seabirds, and 
marine mammals (Okutani et al., 1988; Pearcy et 
al., 1988).  Young squid of the family 
Ommastrephidae play a similar role in the pelagic 
subtropical central and eastern Pacific (Harrison 
and Seki, 1987; Seki, 1993; Young and Hirota, 
1998; Bower et al., 1999).  Alternatively, in all 
tropical, subtropical, and transitional waters of the 
North Pacific, squids of the families 
Enoploteuthidae and Pyroteuthidae are generally 
the most abundant and frequent components of the 
micronekton squid fauna.  With most adults 
attaining dorsal mantle lengths (DML) <60 mm, 
all stages of development, from paralarvae to 
adult, are common in the micronekton.    
 
2.3.1 Family Enoploteuthidae 
 
Seventeen enoploteuthid squid species from four 
genera inhabit the various regions of PICES 
interest; these include five species of 
Enoploteuthis, five species of Abralia, seven 
Abraliopsis, and one Watasenia.  The taxonomy 
and biogeography of the species in this diverse 
family are detailed by McGowan and Okutani 
(1968), Burgess (1982, 1991), Riddell (1985), 
Tsuchiya (1993), Tsuchiya and Okutani (1988, 
1990), Young (1972) and Young and Harman 
(1985).  In the case of Abraliopsis, we adopt the 
nomenclature and reference to the squid species 
reported in Young (1978). Two species, 
Abraliopsis felis and Watasenia scintillans are, in 
particular, key components of the respective 
ecosystems that they occupy.  
 
In the central North Pacific, A. felis is the most 
common and abundant micronektonic squid.  
Latitudinally, it occurs from the boreal waters of 
the Subarctic Domain to waters through the TrZ to 
the southern limits of the Subtropical Frontal Zone  
but is completely absent in the Subtropical 
Domain (Seki, 2001).  Zonally, A. felis is found in 
the Japan/East Sea and exhibits a continuous 
distribution across the basin to the California 
Current.  However, this species is uncommon in 
the western Pacific Ocean (Ivanov, 1997), whereas 
it is dominant (56% of the total cephalod biomass) 
in the California Current (Savinykh, 1999). 
Attaining a maximum size of about 60 mm DML, 
a general shift was observed in its size frequency 
distribution, from slightly larger squid being taken 
in the more northern provinces to smaller sizes 
taken in the south, particularly across the SAB 
(Seki, 2001).  Two other species of Abraliopsis, 
A. pacificus and Abraliopsis sp. A are principally 
subtropical species, but have distributions 
extending through the Subtropical Front into the 
southern TrZ.  The remaining species of 
Abraliopsis are restricted to subtropical waters. 
 
Enoploteuthis chunii is common in shelf waters 
between 23° and 40°N latitudes around Japan and 
in western Pacific waters west of 160°E longitude 
(Tsuchiya, 1993) and is also occasionally found in 
the central North Pacific within the nominal 
bounds of the TrZ.  The other Enoploteuthis 
species, E. higginsi, E. jonesi, and E. reticulata, 
20 
occur only in subtropical waters to the south of the 
Subtropical Frontal Zone.  Enoploteuthis higginsi 
is widely distributed in the tropical Indo-Pacific, 
but not in the eastern Pacific (Tsuchiya, 1993).  
Enoploteuthis reticulata is considered to be a pan-
tropical to subtropical Indo-Pacific species, and 
the most widespread species among the genus 
Enoploteuthis (Tsuchiya, 1993).  Enoploteuthis 
jonesi is distributed in the Central Pacific, 
Hawaiian waters, and equatorial regions (Burgess, 
1982), and is believed to be a mesopelagic 
boundary species (Bower et al., 1999; Seki, 2001).  
  
Several species of Abralia are thought to exhibit 
varying degrees of topographic fidelity.  Abralia 
multihamata and A. andamanica are occupants of 
the shelf waters of Japan north to Sagami Bay 
(Tsuchiya, 1993) and the adult A. trigonura is 
recognized as a member of the Hawaiian 
mesopelagic boundary community (Reid et al., 
1991; Bower et al., 1999).  Abralia similis is found 
in the western TrZ, while A. astrosticta occurs in 
the warm waters of the subtropical Northwest and 
Central Pacific.  Around Hawaii, evidence 
suggests that A. astrosticta is also associated with 
the ocean bottom. 
 
Watasenia scintillans is the most abundant 
enoploteuthid in the western TrZ and it undertakes 
feeding migrations into the northwestern 
Japan/East Sea (Shevtsov and Mokrin, 1998), the 
southern Okhotsk Sea, and Pacific waters off the 
Kuril Islands (Ivanov, 1997).  Recent Russian 
studies have shown that the proportion of the total 
nekton biomass in the western TrZ made up by 
W. scintillans can vary dramatically, from as high 
as approximately 40% in November 2001 to as 
low as about 1% in July 2002. 
 
2.3.2 Family Gonatidae 
 
Squids of the family Gonatidae are cold water 
species (Okutani et al., 1988) and account for the 
majority of cephalopods in the subarctic Pacific. 
Seventeen species of Gonatidae are found as 
juveniles and subadults in regions of PICES 
interest.  
  
Across the subarctic Pacific, species such as 
Gonatus onyx, G. madokai, Gonatus sp. A., 
Gonatopsis borealis, and Berryteuthis magister 
dominate the squid micronekton.  However, all 
members of the family Gonatidae do not occur 
uniformly across the subarctic Pacific.  Gonatus 
middendorffi, Eogonatus tinro, Gonatopsis makko, 
and G. okutanii are found principally in the 
western subarctic.  Restricted to the eastern 
subarctic are Gonatus berryi, G. pyros, 
G. californiensis, G. ursabrunae, G. oregonensis, 
and Berryteuthis anonychus (Okutani et al., 1988).  
In the Bering Sea, Eogonatus tinro, Gonatopsis 
borealis, and B. magister are the dominant species 
(Sinclair and Stabeno, 2002).  Gonatopsis borealis 
has the most extensive north–south distribution, 
extending well into the TrZ near the subtropics 
(Young, 1972; Seki, 2001).   
 
2.3.3 Family Onychoteuthidae 
 
Squids of the family Onychoteuthidae are taken 
throughout the subarctic through to the subtropical 
Pacific, with the most abundant, and frequently 
encountered, belonging to the genus 
Onychoteuthis.  Five species of Onychoteuthis are 
presently recognized in the North Pacific: 
O. borealijaponica, O. compacta, Onychoteuthis 
sp. B, sp. C, and sp. D (Kubodera et al., 1998; 
Seki, 2001).  With the exception of O. 
borealijaponica, which is commonly found in 
higher latitudes, and Onychoteuthis sp. D, a TrZ 
endemic, most Onychoteuthis species tend to be 
found in tropical and subtropical waters of the 
world oceans (Seki, 2001).  
  
Young O. borealijaponica have been caught in the 
temperate, northern TrZ waters, and southward 
along the California Current; adults tend to occupy 
waters farther to the north of the SAB.  
Onychoteuthis sp. D is found throughout the 
subarctic–subtropical TrZ but appears to be 
limited to the north by the SAB.  The length 
frequency distributions of the two transitional–
temperate Onychoteuthis species show clear 
latitudinal trends, with larger animals being 
collected at higher latitudes (Seki, 2001).  This 
trend for O. borealijaponica supports the south 
spawning–north feeding migration pattern 
proposed by Kubodera (1986).  Distribution trends 
observed for Onychoteuthis sp. D suggest a similar 
and spatially complementary pattern.  
    
21 
Onychoteuthis compacta and Walvisteuthis cf. 
rancureli are found throughout the region from 
waters adjacent to the Hawaiian Ridge into the 
TrZ.  Onychoteuthis sp. C was captured only at 
sampling stations positioned closest to the 
Hawaiian Archipelago Islands, and has been 
designated as an island-associated species (Bower 
et al., 1999).  Onychoteuthis sp. B, sp. C and 
Onykia carriboea have been reported only from 
the subtropics; all specimens have been paralarval 
and/or juvenile forms of the respective species.  
  
2.3.4 Family Pyroteuthidae 
 
Like the Enoploteuthidae, members of the 
Pyroteuthidae appear in the micronekton 
throughout their ontogenetic development from 
paralarvae to adult.  Four species (from two 
genera) of Pyroteuthidae are found in the North 
Pacific: Pyroteuthis addolux, Pterygioteuthis 
giardi, P. microlampas, and P. gemmata.  
Pyroteuthis addolux is the only species of the 
genus that occurs in the North Pacific, although its 
considerable meridianal range leads one to wonder 
whether more than one species is present.  
Pterygioteuthis giardi and P. microlampas are two 
of the three species of this genus occurring in the 
North Pacific, the other being P. gemmata which, 
in the North Pacific, occupies waters in the eastern 
Pacific off the southern coast of California.  
Detailed taxonomic descriptions for all three 
species are presented in Riddell (1985).    
  
The extensive distribution currently recognized for 
P. addolux stretches latitudinally from subtropical 
waters south of the Hawaiian Islands through the 
TrZ and bounded to the north by the Subarctic 
Boundary (Jefferts, 1988; Seki, 2001), and 
westward into the California Current.  Pyroteuthis 
addolux collected at more southerly stations have 
tended to be slightly smaller than those sampled 
farther north, however, there have been no obvious 
differences in systematic characters of individuals 
from extremes of the range. 
  
Pterygioteuthis giardi and P. microlampas are 
similar in size and both are frequently caught in 
small numbers throughout the Subtropical Domain 
although their distributions appear to be bounded 
to the north by the Subtropical Front in the 
California Current (Savinykh, 1999). 
 
2.3.5 Other cephalopods  
 
A number of other species warrant mention when 
discussing the cephalopod component of the North 
Pacific micronekton.  As adults, squids of the 
family Ommastrephidae, particularly 
Ommastrephes bartramii and Todarodes pacificus, 
are among (if not the most) commercially 
important North Pacific squid resources, and 
represent keystone species in the ecosystems that 
they inhabit (Murata, 1990).  However, the role of 
these species, as juveniles in the micronekton, is 
poorly understood.  On the other hand, 
Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis appears nearly 
ubiquitous in the subtropical open ocean waters 
and is a key ecosystem component as a predator of 
micronekton, and as the primary prey for seabirds, 
fishes, and cetaceans (Young and Hirota, 1998). 
 
During large-scale faunal surveys in the central 
North Pacific, Chiroteuthis calyx (family 
Chiroteuthidae), Mastigoteuthis pyrodes (family 
Mastigoteuthidae), Galiteuthis phyllura, Taonius 
borealis, and Megalocranchia abyssicola (family 
Cranchiidae) were among the most numerically 
abundant cephalopods in the TrZ to the subarctic; 
Cranchia scabra (family Cranchiidae) was most 
abundant in the subtropics (Seki, 2001).  Unlike 
the squid species mentioned thus far, these species 
are generally characterized by weak musculature, 
are neutrally buoyant, and are readily sampled in 
deeper water during the day.

3. Vertical Distribution Patterns
  
3.1 Mesopelagic Fishes 
 
3.1.1 Significance of diel vertical migration  
 
The most remarkable biological and ecological 
feature of mesopelagic fishes is their diel vertical 
migrations (DVM).  Despite this feature, there 
remain considerable gaps in our knowledge of 
species-specific patterns.  This information is 
needed in order to understand the feeding habits of 
these species, their impact on zooplankton 
biomass, their role as prey of other large nektonic 
animals, and their life history strategies.  DVM in 
this report is defined as a diel vertical migration 
between the mesopelagic and epipelagic zones. 
 
DVM has been regarded as an upward feeding 
migration from the mesopelagic zone into the 
productive epipelagic zone.  However, nighttime 
feeding in the epipelagic zone is also an adaptive 
response to escape from visual epipelagic predators 
such as larger fishes, squids, sea birds, and marine 
mammals (although the light organs of many 
micronektonic fishes might actually increase their 
vulnerability at night).  From the viewpoint of 
ecosystem research, the ecological importance of 
mesopelagic fishes in oceanic ecosystems is of 
interest because of the huge biomass of vertical 
migratory species.  Non-migrants such as genus 
Cyclothone (Gonostomatidae) and Stenobrachius 
nannochir (Myctophidae) can also represent 
considerable mesopelagic biomass.  Their 
ecological significance, however, may be lower 
than that of the vertical migrants since, based on 
their restricted daily ration, their productivity is 
believed to be extremely low (Moku et al., 2000). 
 
3.1.2 DVM patterns 
 
Most myctophids and some sternoptychids (genus 
Maurolicus) and phosichthyds (genus 
Vinceguerria) do not initiate DVM until after 
metamorphosis from larvae to juveniles.  Recently, 
the migration patterns of some common 
myctophids have been documented from the 
transitional waters of the western North Pacific 
(Watanabe et al., 1999).  According to their 
criteria, DVM patterns are categorized into five 
types (Fig. 3.1).  The first two types include the 
migrants in which day and night habitat depths are 
usually separated.  Slope water species show both 
vertical and horizontal migration to the shallow 
coastal waters at night (Reid et al., 1991). 
 
Type 1.  Surface migrant 
 
Fishes of this group are commonly collected at the 
surface by nighttime neuston net sampling 
(Ogawa, 1961; Kawaguchi et al., 1972; Watanabe 
and Kawaguchi, 2003b) or dip-netting from the 
side of a ship.  They are rarely collected in oblique 
tows or by neuston nets towed from the stern.  
Observations at sea suggest that they are good 
swimmers and sometimes jump into the air to 
escape predation by squids.  Their abundance has 
almost certainly been underestimated because of 
their ability to escape from the ship’s bow wave or 
wake.  Moreover, the lower limit of their nighttime 
depth range is not well known, making it even 
more difficult to estimate their biomass. 
 
Type 2.  Midwater migrant 
 
Members of this group rarely occur in neuston 
samples, but are common in samples taken at night 
in the epipelagic zone below 15–20 m depth.  
Their DVM patterns are not well depicted in 
relation to physical oceanographic structures at the 
species level.  It is possible that ecological factors, 
such as resource partitioning, may be a key factor 
controlling their DVM patterns. 
 
Type 3.  Semi-migrant  
 
In this group, part of the population often remains 
at depth at night, resulting in a bimodal vertical 
distribution.  This type of behavior is known only 
from Stenobrachius leucopsarus and Leuroglossus 
schmidti, which are most abundant in the SAW 
and TrW (Paxton, 1967a; Pearcy et al., 1977; 
Frost and McCrone, 1979; Watanabe et al., 1999). 
In the Bering Sea, both species are known to cease 
DMV during winter, suggesting a trade-off 
between prey abundance in the epipelagic zone 
and the energy cost for DVM. 
24 
 
Fig. 3.1 Diel vertical migration patterns of myctophid fishes in transitional waters of the western North 
Pacific off Japan. (taken from Watanabe et al., 1999)  The layers in which more than 75% of the total 
catch was recorded are indicated as the habitat depth;  * denotes surface migrants according to Ogawa 
(1961) and Kawamura and Fujii (1988). 
 
Type 4.  Passive-migrant  
 
The upper limit of distribution expands upward at 
night in this group, probably as a result of 
following vertically migrating prey, such as 
euphausiids.  There is no clear day–night habitat 
separation for this type. 
 
Type 5.  Non-migrant  
 
After metamorphosis from larva to juvenile, the 
fishes of this group stay in the same depth range 
both day and night, although juveniles tend to be 
distributed in shallower depths.  Off California, 
N. regalis of 31–118 mm SL are known to 
undertake DVM between the 50–100 m and 700–
750 m depth layers (Paxton, 1967b), while a non-
migratory population in the western Pacific is 
composed of the specimens larger than 140 mm 
SL, suggesting that the change in DVM pattern 
with growth is probably related to a shift in prey 
size (Watanabe et al., 1999). 
 
The vertical migratory myctophids include both 
eurythermal and stenothermal species.  Surface 
migrants are usually eurythermal, adapting to the 
wide range of temperatures from surface to the 
mesopelagic zone, while midwater-migrants, semi-
migrants, and non-migrants are restricted to the 
narrower temperature range (Fig. 3.2; Watanabe et 
al., 1999).  DVM patterns of the common species 
listed in Tables 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 are summarized in 
Table 3.1, based on present knowledge, although 
the patterns are often modified by physical factors, 
such as water temperature and light.  In the 
western TrZ, it is known that warm-core rings and 
streamers derived from the Kuroshio waters 
crossing the Kuroshio Front depress the nighttime 
migration depth of subarctic and TrW species 
(Watanabe et al., 1999).  These results suggest a 
possible seasonal change in the DVM patterns in 
those regions where marked seasonal temperature 
change is expected and/or ice covers the sea 
surface (e.g., the Bering and Okhotsk Seas).  No 
seasonal variations in vertical distributions and 
migrations have been detected for any species in 
the eastern Pacific TrW (Pearcy and Laurs, 1966). 
The distribution and DVM patterns in comparable 
water masses are known to be similar for SAW 
and TrW species between the eastern and western 
Pacific TrW (Paxton, 1967a; Pearcy et al., 1977; 
Watanabe et al., 1999).  Biological factors such as 
prey availability may also be important in defining 
DVM patterns, especially in highly productive 
areas (e.g., slope waters and over seamounts, such 
as those found in the Bering Sea) during winter, 
25 
when the most of the zooplankton biomass is 
concentrated in the layer deeper than 100 m depth. 
 
DVM within the lower mesopelagic zone below 
500 m depth has been suggested for some species 
that are considered non-migrants or passive 
migrants in Table 3.1 (Willis and Pearcy, 1980; 
Willis and Pearcy, 1982), but detailed analysis of 
this migration remains for future study.  
 
3.1.3 Ontogenetic change in DVM patterns 
 
In general, the depth range of DVM is known to 
shift deeper with age in species, such as S. 
leucopsarus, Diaphus theta and Protomyctophum 
thompsoni (Frost and McCrone, 1979).  Juveniles 
are known to occur at shallower depth layers, 
compared to adults, during the daytime (Clarke, 
1973).  For some species like Nannobrachium 
regale, Sigmops gracile, S. elongatum, and 
probably most species of Lampadena, the 
juveniles initially undergo active DVM.  As they 
get older, however, DVM behavior gradually 
ceases. All myctophid, gonostomatid and 
bathylagid larvae are distributed in the epipelagic 
zone prior to metamorphosis.  Most known species 
of myctophids (at least 15 species in the 
subtropical western Pacific and three species in the 
eastern North Atlantic) undergo metamorphosis in 
the mesopelagic zone between 300–900 m depth 
(Badcock and Merrett, l976; Loeb, 1979a; Clarke, 
1973; Sassa, 2001), with the exceptional of some 
species of myctophids in the genus Diaphus, 
which are reported to start DVM from the 
metamorphosis stage (Sassa, 2001).

Japan (Watanabe et al., 1999).  Surface migrants (Symolophorus californiensis and Tarletonbeania 
taylori) are very eurythermal and the temperature difference between the day and night habitats is 14–
17°C, while nonmigratory species such as Stenobrachius nannochir and L. regalis) are very stenothermal 
and found in water at 2–4°C throughout the day.

3.2 Crustacean Micronekton 
 
The massive pan-oceanic DVM of the zooplankton 
and micronekton community is one of the most 
prominent characteristics in the short-term 
biomass variability in the pelagic ecosystem. 
Considerable debate has taken place about the 
ultimate (long-term) and proximate (immediate) 
factors controlling this behavior.  The most 
generally accepted hypothesis is that DVM is a 
trade-off between food intake and risk of predation 
by planktivorous fish.  Euphausiids occupy poorly 
illuminated habitats during the day to reduce the 
probability of detection and attack by visual 
predators, but at the cost of decreased net energy 
gain.  Thus, smaller, less vulnerable euphausiids 
should ascend into food-rich surface waters earlier 
and descend later than larger, more conspicuous 
organisms (De Robertis, 2002a,b; De Robertis et 
al., 2003a).  However, daytime predation mortality 
may not be negligible.  Myctophids are 
mesopelagic low-light-adapted predators, and they 
may prey on euphausiids during the day when the 
euphausiids reach deeper waters.  Euphausiids are 
particularly exposed to top predators when they 
form surface swarms during the day, apparently 
associated with reproduction.  This is particularly 
noteworthy for Thysanoessa spinifera in central 
California (Smith and Adams, 1988) and 
Nyctiphanes simplex in the Gulf of California, 
although surface swarms also have been observed 
along the Pacific coast of Baja California 
(Gendron, 1992).  Surface swarms have been 
reported for Euphausia pacifica (Kotori, 1995) 
and E. nana (Hanamura et al., 2001) in Japan, 
however, Endo et al. (1985) did not associate 
reproduction with the surface swarms of E. 
pacifica in the Japan/East Sea. 
 
The early ontogenetic, vertical distribution is 
partially dependent on the euphausiid reproductive 
strategy.  In broadcast spawners, the initial 
locations (maximum spawning depth) of newly 
produced eggs should be identical to those of their 
mothers at the moment of spawning, but only for a 
short period (perhaps few hours) due to extensive 
female DVM.  The eggs behave as passive, 
sinking particles.  The overall result is an 
imperfect match between cross-shelf distributions 
of euphausiid eggs and mature females which, in 
coastal waters, may cause a cross-shelf age 
segregation with the bulk of larvae standing stock 
distributed near the coast, and most of the 
juveniles and adults distributed far offshore 
(Gómez-Gutiérrez et al., 2005).   For sac-
spawning species, the mismatch of larvae 
distribution versus juvenile and adult distribution 
occurs after hatching because the embryos develop 
inside the ovigerous sac (Gómez-Gutiérrez, 
2003a).  Currently, most juvenile and adult 
euphausiids are considered macrozooplankton or 
micronekton which drift with the currents; these 
crustaceans are capable of migrating hundreds of 
meters vertically during circadian cycles (Nicol, 
2003).  The DVM of euphausiids is regulated by 
complex behavioral patterns modulated by a suite 
of potential exogenous (e.g., light, temperature, 
gravity, oxygen, mixing layer, prey and predators, 
and inter- and intra-specific competition) and 
endogenous factors (e.g., sex, age, physiology, 
biological rhythms, and metabolism rates).  
Because different euphausiid life stages have 
different vertical distribution patterns and 
swimming capabilities, they are also expected to 
have distinct zonation patterns.  This is 
particularly evident in nearshore regions where 
coastal spawning areas and juvenile recruitment 
are significantly separated by intense larval drift 
and local current circulation (Gómez-Gutiérrez et 
al., 2005). 
 
Euphausiids are completely planktonic as larvae, 
but become micronektonic when they are juveniles 
and adults (Nicol, 2003).  Euphausiids undergo 
DVM as juveniles and adults, moving close to 
surface during the night to feed in the productive 
euphotic zone before migrating back down to 
deeper waters during the day (Ponomareva, 1963; 
Brinton, 1967; Brinton and Wyllie, 1976; 
Youngbluth, 1976).  The best studied euphausiid 
species is probably E. pacifica, the subject of a 
considerable number of publications on its 
distribution range, most of which were recently 
summarized by De Robertis (2002a,b), De 
Robertis et al. (2003a), and Nakagawa et al. 
(2003).  The vertical range of DVM in this species 
varies with size and water clarity, but is typically 
more than 100 m depth (Brinton, 1967).  Over 
continental shelves, daytime depth may be at or 
very near the seabed, which poses additional 
sampling problems.  This near bottom biomass 
concentration of E. pacifica and N. simplex along 
28 
the west coast of Baja California has also been 
recognized as an important food source for 
demersal predators (Robinson and Gómez-
Gutiérrez, 1998a), and may represent an important 
link between epibenthic and pelagic communities. 
Iguchi and Ikeda (2004) reported the vertical 
distribution, population structure, and life history 
of Thysanoessa longipes in the central Japan/East 
Sea. This species is present throughout a broad 
bathymetric layer (<1000 m depth) with peak 
abundance at 30–300 m during the night and 150–
500 m during the day.  This species shows a clear 
trend of larger specimens occurring at deeper 
depths.  In the western Pacific, long-distance 
vertical migrants, the Euphausia species, showed 
clear nocturnal feeding habits.  The non-migrant 
and short-distance vertical migrants, the 
Stylocheiron and Pseudeuphausia species, did not 
exhibit clear diurnal feeding rhythms.  Layers at 
which maximum stomach fullness of the 
Nematoscelis and Stylocheiron species occurred 
were both the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones, 
whereas maximum stomach fullness of the 
Euphausia species occurred only in the epipelagic 
zone.  In the Euphausia species, the depth of high 
stomach fullness corresponded to the maximum 
chlorophyll layer (Hirota and Nemoto, 1990). 
 
Horizontal spatial distribution is intensely patchy 
at a variety of scales.  At somewhat larger scales 
(1–10 km cross-shore, 10–100 km alongshore), 
there is a clear association of high euphausiid 
biomass with bathymetric edges, and with shelf-
edge currents and upwelling plumes.  Very dense 
swarms (abundances >10
3
 m
–3
), with a diameter 
about 10–100 m, are occasionally observed at the 
sea surface during daylight, providing highly 
aggregated feeding opportunities for predators that 
can visually detect them.  
  
Although there is no evidence that any euphausiid 
species consistently exhibits a reverse DVM 
pattern (i.e., up by day, down by night), several 
species do regularly form daytime surface 
aggregations for behavioral, feeding, and 
reproductive purposes.  For example, in the 
western Pacific (Japan/East Sea) E. pacifica 
commonly forms dense daytime surface swarms 
that facilitate the commercial exploitation of this 
species, while daytime surface swarms of 
E. pacifica are less common along the North 
American coast (Nicol and Endo, 1997).  
However, daytime surface swarms have been 
commonly observed in highly abundant neritic 
euphausiids like T. spinifera, Pseudeuphausia 
latifrons and N. simplex (Smith and Adams, 1988; 
Gendron, 1992; Wilson et al., 2001, 2003).  
Euphausiids can swim at speeds ranging from 1 to 
4 cm s
–1
 (Lasker, 1966), but dense scattering 
layers of E. pacifica and N. simplex migrate at 
speeds ranging between only 0.3 and 0.7 cm s
–1
 
(Robinson and Gómez-Gutiérrez, 1998a).  The 
swimming behavior of euphausiids (either as 
individuals or as swarms) makes them particularly 
difficult to sample, and to understand the ultimate 
driving forces of the DVM in a given location 
(Brinton, 1967; Nicol, 2003).  
  
Like myctophids, mesopelagic shrimps and mysids 
are categorized into migratory and non-migratory 
groups based on their DVM patterns (Foxton, 
1970a,b; Aizawa, 1974; Omori, 1974a; Heffernan 
and Hopkins, 1981; Krygier and Pearcy, 1981; 
Kikuchi and Omori, 1985; Krygier and Murano, 
1988; Toczko et al., unpubl. MS).  With the 
exception of the epipelagic penaeid decapod 
Sergestes similis, the dominant decapod and mysid 
species are mesopelagic and are only rarely found 
above 400 m during the day or night.  The biology 
and ecology of shrimps of the genus Sergestes, 
including growth, morphology, feeding, larval and 
postlarval development, DVM, and population 
dynamics (Pearcy and Forss, 1969; Nemoto, 1970; 
Judkins and Fleminger, 1972; Walters, 1976; Frost 
and McCrone, 1979; Omori, 1979; Omori and 
Gluck, 1979; Cowles, 2001) are among the most 
well known and studied.  Much less is known 
about the biology of other pelagic decapod species 
in the North Pacific.  Maynard et al. (1975), in a 
study of micronektonic standing stock in the upper 
1200 m off Hawaii, showed that total penaeids 
(mostly sergestids), caridean shrimps, and 
myctophid fishes have abundances of 1.3, 0.3, and 
0.8 m
–2
, respectively, confirming their importance 
as micronekton.  Although some species occupy 
the entire mesopelagic zone down to 1500 m 
depth, others are restricted to the upper 500 m of 
the water column (Wicksten, 2002).  In the eastern 
North Pacific, two major components of the 
micronekton are euphausiids and decapod shrimps, 
chiefly E. pacifica and Sergestes similis; both 
species are conspicuous diel vertical migrators 
29 
(Frost and McCrone, 1979).  Samples collected in 
horizontal hauls immediately following sunset 
showed that three migratory species, the two 
migratory myctophids, and E. pacifica, were 
closely associated with the single migratory 
sound-scattering layer (12 kHz); S. similis lagged 
the ascent of the migratory scattering layer.  
  
In the southern part of the California Current 
System, the pelagic red crab Pleuroncodes 
planipes has three main life phases: (1) a 
planktonic phase during its zoea-through-galathea 
stage (analogous to the megalop stage for 
brachyuran), (2) an obligate pelagic phase during 
the first year of life as a juvenile and adult, and 
(3) a flexible pelagic–benthic phase for animals 
older than 2 years (Boyd, 1967; Aurioles-Gamboa, 
1992; Gómez-Gutiérrez and Sánchez-Ortíz, 1997). 
However, the diel vertical distribution of the red 
crab seems to be quite adaptive and flexible, with 
their DVM patterns being associated with daily 
food availability, allowing them to move suddenly 
(< 1 h) from the seafloor to rich food layers near 
the surface (Robinson and Gómez-Gutiérrez, 
1998b), or with local currents, where they must 
actively swim vertically in the column layer to 
maintain themselves for long diurnal periods close 
to large concentrations of food (Robinson and 
Gómez-Aguirre, 2004). 
 
3.3 Cephalopod Micronekton 
 
Many oceanic cephalopods appear to undergo 
DVM which enable them to maximize the 
  
breadth of their trophic niche while simultaneously 
minimizing risks from predation in the upper 
photic layers of the water column.  Like most 
vertical migrators, squid ascend towards the ocean 
surface at dusk and return to deeper waters at 
dawn.  In subtropical waters around Hawaii, 
Young (1978) reported that about 60% of 
cephalopod species underwent DVM. 
 
For species in the PICES region, Roper and Young 
(1975) reported that Abraliopsis felis undergoes a 
DVM of more than 300 m off the coast of 
California, ascending from a mean daytime depth 
of 450 m to a mean nighttime depth of 100 m.  
Similarly, other enoploteuthids and pyroteuthids in 
the subtropics appear to vertically migrate (Roper 
and Young, 1975).  However, no evidence of any 
diel movement for Watasenia scintillans has been 
observed off Japan (Yamamura et al., 1993a).  To 
the north, most of the eurybathic gonatids 
(including most Gonatus species, Gonatopsis 
borealis and Berryteuthis anonychus) exhibit 
DVM from daytime depths of 400–800 m to 
nighttime depths of generally shallower than 
400 m, e.g., G. borealis (Roper and Young, 1975), 
B. anonychus (Pearcy and Voss, 1963), 
G. californiensis, G. madokai, G. ursabrunae, and 
G. oregonensis (Jefferts, 1983).

4. Biomass Patterns 
 
4.1 Micronektonic Fish 
 
In the western subarctic Pacific waters, the 
biomass of micronektonic fish ranges from 4.5 to 
6.5 g m
–2
 wet weight as measured by bridle-free 
micronekton nets such as Isaacs-Kidd Midwater 
Trawl (IKMT) and Rectangular Midwater Trawl 
(RMT) nets (Table 4.1).  Ocean Research Institute 
(ORI)-net sampling usually results in a smaller 
biomass, possibly due to the avoidance effect 
generated by the bridles.  Commercial-sized trawls 
usually yield biomass estimates that are up to an 
order of magnitude higher because of their 
increased efficiency for sampling larger 
micronekton, such as Lampadena, Nanno-
brachium, Lampanyctus, and other large 
mesopelagic fishes.   
 
Biomass levels in the Okhotsk and Bering Seas are 
about the same as in the subarctic waters, but the 
composition is quite different at the family level, 
with bathylagids being dominant in these marginal 
seas, and myctophids dominating in the open 
subarctic.  Biomass in the eastern subarctic and 
transitional areas tends to be lower than in the 
western regions although, at present, the only 
comparable sampling by similar gear types in the 
same season has been that of Nishikawa et al. 
(2001), based on RMT-8 sampling from each gyre. 
 
In the Kuroshio region, biomass is higher along 
the shoreward side of the current axis (2.4 ± 0.8 
vs. 1.6 ± 0.4 g m
–2
 wet weight), likely reflecting 
higher productivity as a result of interactions with 
coastal shelf waters (Table 4.1).  Biomass 
estimates from different sized gears (e.g., ORI net 
vs. IKMT) do not show substantial differences as 
observed in the subarctic, probably because of the 
smaller size spectrum of subtropical species, and 
due to the increase in proportion of gonostomatids, 
which are less active swimmers than myctophids. 
Clarke (1973) reported 0.3 g m
–2
 wet weight for 
myctophids in the Eastern North Pacific Central 
Waters, which would be comparable to roughly 
the 1.6 ± 0.4 g m
–2
 (wet weight) present in 
offshore areas of the Kuroshio Current, when this 
dominance of gonostomatids is considered.  No 
reliable estimates of mesopelagic fishes made by 
commercial trawls are currently available for the 
subtropical North Pacific, although Hidaka et al. 
(2003) report biomass and taxonomic composition 
of diel migratory myctophids, together with other 
micronektonic animals, such as squids, shrimps 
and euphausiids, based on commercial-size trawl 
sampling. 
 
In the case of shelf-edge or slope water species, 
dense aggregations are often formed at night along 
the shelf edge which could perhaps be best 
estimated by acoustics.  At present, there are no 
biomass estimates available, with the exception of 
those for Maurolicus japonicus, in the Japan/East 
Sea.  Ohshimo (1998) acoustically estimated the 
biomass of M. japonicus at the shelf edge of the 
Japan/East Sea to be 3.0 g m
–2
 wet weight. 
   
Decadal changes in the relative abundance of 
surface migratory myctophid fishes in the 
Kuroshio region, in relation to fluctuations of 
Kuroshio transport volume, were studied from 
1957 to 1994 (Watanabe and Kawaguchi, 2003b).  
These studies show substantial interannual 
variability and decadal-scale trends in some 
species (Fig. 4.1).

5. Life History
5.1 Fish Micronekton 
 
5.1.1 Age and growth 
Life history information (i.e., age, growth and 
fecundity) on mesopelagic fishes accumulated 
until the mid-1990s has been reviewed by 
Gjøsaeter and Kawaguchi (1980) and Beamish et 
al. (1999).  Since then, with the exception of some 
new information on the growth of Diaphus theta 
and early growth rates based on daily increments 
of otoliths, no remarkable advances have been 
made in the northern North Pacific.  Therefore, we 
summarize here the available knowledge 
accumulated over the past 25 years, mainly in 
subarctic and subtropical regions, and include the 
Antarctic waters. 
 
Validations of daily growth otolith increments of 
myctophids have been conducted for six species: 
Benthosema suborbitale, Diaphus dumerilii, 
D. theta, D. kapalae, Lepidophanes guentheri, and 
Myctophum asperum (Table 5.1), suggesting the 
possibility that these daily increments would be 
universally observed, at least among vertically 
migrating myctophids.  In general (as seems to be 
the case for most fish species), the otolith 
increments of myctophids are clearly discernible 
during larval and juvenile stages, but become 
harder to read following metamorphosis. 
Linkowski (1991) also cautions that the otoliths of 
many myctophids are characterized by multiple 
primordia, further complicating the ability to 
obtain accurate age estimates in young specimens.  
 
Based on the validated daily increments, together 
with traditional reading of annual otolith rings, 
growth rates were studied for both early and adult 
stages (Table 5.1).  Based on increment width in 
the larval zone, larval growth rates are known to 
increase with age prior to metamorphosis in the 
subarctic Stenobrachius leucopsarus and three 
subtropical myctophid species (Gartner, 1991b; 
Methot, 1981), although growth is linear for both 
larval and juvenile stages in D. theta (Moku et al., 
2001).  As expected, the larval periods of subarctic 
species are much longer than those of tropical and 
  
subtropical species (Table 5.1).  In most cases, 
growth rates are highest during the early juvenile 
stage (i.e., just after metamorphosis), when DVM 
is initiated, and rates subsequently decrease as the 
fish get older.  Sexual differences in growth rates 
have been reported for Electrona antarctica, with 
a higher rate for females than for males (Table 
5.1). 
 
Lunar periodicity in daily otolith increment 
formation has been reported for surface migratory 
Myctophum asperum and M. nitidulum, in which 
growth rate is slower at full moon, probably due to 
depression of the upper limit of the migration 
depth during a full moon (Giragosov and 
Ovcharov, 1992; Hayashi et al., 2001a).  However, 
in the case of four species of Hygophum, growth 
rates are highest during the full moon (Linkowski, 
1996), probably because these species migrate up 
to the productive warm surface layers only during 
a full moon night. 
 
Gjøsaeter and Kawaguchi (1980) and Beamish et 
al. (1999) reviewed the age of maturity and 
lifespan of myctophids.  Generally, in tropical and 
subtropical waters, small-sized myctophids (less 
than ~ 40 mm SL) mature one year after hatching, 
while medium-sized species can take 2–4 years to 
mature.  As expected, maturity usually occurs 1–2 
years later in subarctic waters than in subtropical 
and tropical waters.  Deeper dwelling species, and 
those found farther north, also tend to have older 
age of maturity.  In the Bering Sea and Okhotsk 
Sea, myctophids such as S. leucopsarus and 
D. theta grow to an extraordinary size, probably 
due to expatriation or feeding migrations.  
 
In general, spawning frequency usually ranges 
from 1 to approximately 4 years, with an increase 
in fecundity with body size.  An acute decrease in 
catch is observed in the larger size range after 
spawning; lifespan is, therefore, thought to 
coincide with the age of the largest spawners.  The 
lifespan of larger-sized myctophids in the 
subarctic, subtropical and transitional waters is 
presently unknown, and remains a topic for future 
study.

Studies of the three vertically non-migrant species 
of Cyclothone that co-occur in Sagami Bay, on the 
east coast of Japan (C. alba, C. pseudopallida, and 
C. atraria), reveal some interesting life history 
differences.  Miya and Nemoto (1991) showed that 
adult size, age-at-maturity, age-at-reproduction, 
number of spawning cycles, and fecundity all 
increased with depth.  Thus, C. alba (which occurs 
from 300–500 m depth) reaches maturity at age 1–
2 years (at length 16–20 mm) and spawns only 
once, with mature females producing about 250 
eggs.  In contrast, C. pseudopallida (at depths of 
400–600 m) matures at age 2–3 years (at length 
20–30 mm), spawns at least two times, with 
mature females producing about 600 eggs.  The 
deepest species, C. atraria (which occurs from 
400 to >1000 m), matures at age 3–4 years (at 
length 22–40 mm) and spawns at least twice, with 
mature females producing about 1000 eggs.  Miya 
and Nemoto (1991) suggest that this vertical 
gradient in life history characteristics reflects the 
decrease in food supply with depth, and that the 
larvae of the deeper species experience higher 
mortality rates than those in shallower waters.  
Interestingly, similar vertical gradients in life 
history characteristics have been shown to exist 
among Cyclothone assemblages elsewhere in the 
North Pacific, including the Hawaiian Islands 
(Maynard et al., 1975; Maynard, 1982) and off the 
coast of southern California (DeWitt, 1972). 
  
5.1.2 Production 
 
As a considerable amount of knowledge on growth 
rate and age has been previously obtained, 
estimates of productivity, including the P/B 
(annual production to mean annual biomass) ratio 
should be possible for the dominant subarctic 
species, and much easier to estimate for 
subtropical and tropical species with a 1-year 
lifespan.  Despite this, such studies are presently 
lacking. 
 
5.1.3 Reproduction 
 
Information on the spawning season of 
mesopelagic fishes has recently been estimated 
from the seasonal occurrence of larvae for 
subarctic, transitional and subtropical species in 
the California Current region (Moser et al., 
1993a,b, 1994, 2001), and the western North 
Pacific (Sassa, 2001; Sassa et al., 2004a,b; Moku 
et al., 2003), which supplements the previous 
reviews by Gjøsaeter and Kawaguchi (1980) and 
Beamish et al. (1999).  In the eastern Gulf of 
Mexico, reproductive patterns (including sex ratio, 
oocyte development, sizes at sexual maturity, 
spawning season, fecundity related to size, and 
spawning strategies) were determined for the 
seven numerically dominant myctophid species 
(Gartner, 1993).  Myctophum nitidulum, M. affine, 
and M. asperum are known to spawn all year 
round, with their peak spawning periods 
segregated.  Their fecundities have also been 
reported, based on the histological observation of 
gonads (Oven, 1985). Similar year-round 
spawning is also reported for Diaphus suborbitalis 
in the tropical Indian Ocean (Lisovenko and 
Prut’ko, 1986). 
  
Spawning migrations of myctophid and 
microstomatid fishes are reported for the subarctic 
and transitional species such as Notoscopelus 
japonicus, Symbolophorus californiensis, D. theta 
and Lipolagus ochotensis, based on their larval 
distribution patterns (Fig. 5.1; Moku et al., 2003; 
Sassa et al., 2004a,b). 
 
Fecundities have been reported for subtropical and 
tropical Benthosema fibulatum, B. pterotum, and 
B. suborbitale (Gjøsaeter, 1981; Hussain and Ali-
Khan, 1987), for subarctic Atlantic B. glaciale, 
Protomyctophum arcticum, and Lampanyctus 
macdonaldi (Kawaguchi and Mauchline, 1982), 
and for Lampanyctodes hectoris and Maurolicus 
muelleri in the southern South Pacific (Young et 
al., 1987).  It seems remarkable that fecundities 
are known for only a handful of species from a 
few genera or species belonging to shelf-edge 
(slope water) species.  Generally, mature female 
myctophids are rarely collected, which has 
resulted in a restricted knowledge of their 
fecundity.  Spawning behaviors in the field, 
including the possible formation of dense 
spawning aggregation at depths, remain for future 
studies, since inactive spermatozoa have been 
reported in L. hectoris and Diaphus danae in the 
southern Pacific off Tasmania (Young et al., 
1987).

5.1.4 Mortality 
 
Available information concerning the mortality of 
mesopelagic fishes has been restricted to only a 
few studies, due largely to an insufficient number 
of aged specimens. Annual mortality of 
Benthosema glaciale has been estimated to be 
83% in the northwestern Atlantic (Halliday, 1970), 
but only 52% (z = 0.74) in Norwegian waters 
(Gjøsaeter, 1973), indicating a highly variable 
mortality rate within the same species inhabiting 
different zoogeographical regions.  Young et al. 
(1988) estimated the annual mortality rate of 
Lampanyctodes hectoris to be 79%.  Gjøsaeter 
(1981) reported the instantaneous mortality rate (z) 
of 0.8 for Notoscopelus kroeyeri.  All the above 
estimates should be considered tentative, however, 
since they are based mainly on the age 
composition of samples collected by gears with 
considerable sampling bias related with fish size. 
In this regard, the establishment of a set of 
standard sampling gears capable of collecting a 
wide size range (~15–150 mm SL) of mesopelagic 
fishes is recommended as a subject for future 
study.

North Pacific functions as spawning or nursery grounds for not only commercial epipelagic fishes, but 
also for various subarctic, transitional, and subtropical myctophid fishes.

5.2 Crustacean Micronekton 
 
Most euphausiid taxa (approximately 71%, 7 genera 
and 61 species out of a total of 11 genera and 86 
species) are broadcast spawners (Brinton et al., 
2000).  Epipelagic euphausiid life cycles from the 
North Pacific range from 1 to 3 years (compared 
with 4 to 7 years for the Antarctic krill, Euphausia 
superba); the subtropical species usually have a 
shorter lifespan (<1 year) than temperate species, 
but Arctic species, and meso and bathypelagic 
euphausiids, may have longer lifespans than 
epipelagic euphausiids, and with relatively little 
latitudinal variation in the lifespan (Nemoto et al., 
1977; Ross et al., 1982; Lavaniegos, 1992; Ross 
and Quetin, 2000; Iguchi and Ikeda, 2004).  Ross 
and Quetin (2000) reviewed the reproduction of 
euphausiids, with emphasis on species of 
commercial value, all of which exhibit a broadcast 
spawning strategy.  They did not include estimates 
of the fecundity of sac-spawning species in their 
review, some of which, like Pseudeuphausia 
latifrons (southwestern Pacific <40°N) and 
Nyctiphanes simplex (southern section of the 
California Current System and Gulf of California), 
or Nematoscelis difficilis (North Pacific TrZ) 
(Brinton, 1962), are dominant in several 
ecosystems.  However, several other sac-spawning 
species, like Nematoscelis spp. and Stylocheiron 
spp. seem to be significantly less abundant in the 
North Pacific.  Nematoscelis difficilis produces 
egg sacs containing up to 560 eggs fem
–1
 (Nemoto 
et al., 1972), similar to other North Pacific 
broadcast spawning species, but N. simplex usually 
produces ovigerous sacs smaller than 61 eggs 
fem
–1
 (Gendron, 1992; Lavaniegos, 1995).  
Euphausiids show latitudinal gradients in both 
duration and timing of reproduction (Feinberg and 
Peterson, 2003).  Generally, earlier and longer 
spawning seasons occur at lower latitudes, with 
the timing and duration of spawning of coastal 
species often synchronized to the period of 
elevated food production (Ross and Quetin, 2000).  
At the highest latitudes, and in the coldest waters, 
first maturation may require two growing seasons, 
for example, Thysanoessa longipes becomes 
mature at the age of 2 years and spawns at 20–28 
mm total length, and individuals who have 
spawned might survive for a third year (Nemoto, 
1957; Iguchi and Ikeda, 2004).  In Arctic latitudes, 
T. inermis and T. raschi have a short spawning 
season (<2 months) in spring or early summer, 
whereas in subarctic latitudes these same species 
(in addition to Euphasia pacifica) typically have 
spawn over 3 to 6 months between March and 
September.  In temperate regions reproduction of 
E. pacifica and N. simplex seems to occur 
throughout the year, with periods of higher 
spawning activity during summer or fall (Brinton, 
1976; Lavaniegos, 1995; Ross and Quetin, 2000).  
For most species, reproduction is generally 
concentrated in spring, and it is recognized that 
most euphausiids spawn several times during each 
reproductive season.  Thysanoessa longipes, in the 
central Japan/East Sea, reproduces over only a 
limited period during the year, between April and 
May, and although this species has a relatively 
long lifespan for the North Pacific (~3 years), 
females reach maturity in 2 years (Iguchi and 
Ikeda, 2004).  At mid-latitudes (approximately 35–
55°N), reproductive maturity is usually at several 
months (6 months for N. simplex and 9 months for 
E. pacifica), but some older and larger individuals 
are often present in the population (Lavaniegos, 
1992, 1995; Feinberg et al., 2003; Gómez-
Gutiérrez, 2003b).  These larger individuals are 
the most “micronektonic” in size (>20 mm) and 
avoidance capability (Brinton, 1967; Hovekamp, 
1989).  Reproduction remains concentrated in 
spring and early summer, but additional summer 
cohorts are often detectable in size-frequency 
histograms (e.g., Brinton, 1976, Lavaniegos, 1995; 
Gómez-Gutiérrez et al., 1996). Individual growth 
slows or ceases during the winter, then resumes 
the following spring.  Most studies suggest a 
maximum population biomass in early autumn, 
following the summer growing season.  At lower 
latitudes (<35°N), growth and reproduction are 
less clearly seasonal, and appear to be more 
closely tied to upwelling events and the resulting 
shorter-term variation in food supply (Ross and 
Quetin, 2000; Feinberg and Peterson, 2003).  
Siegel (2000a) and Siegel and Nicol (2000) 
summarized information on krill population 
parameters in the world oceans, including lifespan, 
growth, mortality, and production.  Drawing on 
these data sources, the life history (growth and 
age, production, reproduction, and mortality) of 
euphausiids in the North Pacific is depicted below. 
 
Feinberg and Peterson (2003), and references 
therein, summarized several studies about the 
40 
timing of the spawning season for the euphausiids, 
primarily E. pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera, in 
the North Pacific.  The spawning period of these 
species, and probably of most temperate species, is 
seasonally limited.  This implies that there is one 
cycle of ovarian maturation and regression per 
year, though it is possible to have several broods 
of eggs during the reproductive season (Ross and 
Quetin, 2000).  Durations of spawning season 
greatly vary regionally and temporally; even for 
the same population there is considerable year-to-
year variability both in spawning season duration 
and intensity of reproduction.  Euphausia pacifica, 
in the coastal waters off California and Oregon, 
reproduces from March to around mid-October, 
but the main reproductive peak is between May 
and August (Smiles and Pearcy, 1971; Brinton 
1976).  In Toyama Bay, Japan, however, the 
spawn of E. pacifica grows actively only for the 
first half of the year due to the high thermal 
regime in the upper layers, and low food supply in 
the latter half of the year (Iguchi and Ikeda, 1994, 
1999).  
 
The average brood size of E. pacifica populations 
from Puget Sound, Washington (Ross et al., 
1982), Toyama Bay (Iguchi and Ikeda, 1994; 
1999) and from the Oregon coast (Gómez-
Gutiérrez, 2003b), are not significantly different. 
However, the maximum brood sizes are 
significantly larger for the Oregon population (599 
eggs fem
–1
) in comparison with Toyama Bay (296 
eggs fem
–1
) and Puget Sound (258 eggs fem
–1
).  
Along the Oregon coast the maximum brood size 
recorded for T. spinifera is considerably larger 
(859 eggs fem
–1
) than for E. pacifica, but the 
average brood size is not significantly different. 
Thysanoessa spinifera spawns primarily in spring 
and early summer during upwelling events and at 
depths between 50 and 150 m depth (Feinberg and 
Peterson, 2003; Gómez-Gutiérrez, 2003b).  The 
average interbrood period of E. pacifica under 
laboratory conditions is 6.5 days, but there is a 
large female-to-female variability (1 to 27 days), 
reflecting the difficulty in estimating fecundity in 
this species (Feinberg et al., 2003; Gómez-
Gutiérrez, 2003b). The estimation of the 
interbrood period to calculate the fecundity of 
T. spinifera has been unsuccessful because mature 
females collected in the field and incubated in the 
laboratory spawn only once even if they are 
provided the same experimental conditions as 
those for E. pacifica, which may spawn several 
times after collection.  In addition, it has been 
difficult to estimate the interbrood period of T. 
spinifera using the proportion of ripe females, by 
the method reported by Ross et al. (1982), because 
most of the specimens analyzed were associated 
with degenerate gonads, although the cause of this 
is still unknown (Gómez-Gutiérrez, 2003b). 
 
In the southern part of the California Current 
System, N. simplex spawns during spring and 
summer, with a second spawning of lower 
intensity occurring in fall.  This species has 
multiple brood production within a reproductive 
season (~ 3 spawning events with brood sizes < 61 
eggs fem
–1
), averaging about 2% of the total 
secondary production (body growth, exuvia) 
(Gendron, 1992; Lavaniegos, 1995; Gómez-
Gutiérrez, 1995; Gómez-Gutiérrez et al., 1996). 
However, Gómez-Gutiérrez and Robinson (2005) 
reported the interbrood period of N. simplex 
ranged
 
between 7 and 15 days at 16–18°C.  This 
interbrood period is about
 
one-fourth to half of 
what was previously assumed for this species, 
suggesting a significant underestimation of the 
fecundity of
 
this species.  In the western Pacific, 
Pseudeuphasia latifrons reproduces throughout the 
year and histological studies show continuous 
oogenesis and spermatogenesis, suggesting 
multiple spawnings with average brood sizes of 83 
eggs fem
–1
 (Wilson et al., 2003).  In the South 
China Sea, P. latifrons peak reproduction, 
indicated by larvae, takes place during, and 
immediately following, the northeast monsoon 
season when adults are also at their maximum 
abundance (Brinton, 1975). 
 
Spawning of the deep sea Thysanopoda species is 
poorly known but may occur repeatedly at certain 
intervals.  These species produce large eggs, 
possibly an adaptation to a deep-sea environment 
where food is scarce (Nemoto et al., 1977).  The 
fecundity (even brood size) for most of the species 
from oceanic populations is completely unknown. 
The same is true for most vital rates, such as 
growth, molting, and feeding. 
 
Walters (1976) described the ecology of 20 
species of sergestid shrimps off the coast of 
Hawaii.  He found that spawning occurs mainly in 
41 
the spring, but may also occur year round, during 
an average lifespan of 1 year, and similar to 
lifespans reported off Oregon (Pearcy and Forss, 
1969).  Fecundity is difficult to measure since 
sergestids spawn their eggs directly into the water, 
rather than carry them on appendages like 
Caridean shrimp or mysids. 
 
Wittmann (1984) summarized the reproduction 
and duration of marsupial development for more 
than 40 species of mysids from different latitudes. 
Temperature was the most important factor 
responsible for variations in development times; 
egg size had a much smaller effect.  Incubation 
times were inversely related to temperature and 
ranged from 8 days at 30°C to 180 days at 3°C. 
Because the larvae hatch has a completely formed 
juvenile stage, the number of eggs that can be 
accommodated in the oostegite is relatively lower 
(usually < 30 embryos) than that seen in sac-
spawning euphausiids (Gómez-Gutiérrez, 2003a; 
Gómez-Gutiérrez and Robinson, 2005).  The 
mysid larvae are regularly oriented, with the 
anterior ends pointing posteriorly and dorsal 
surfaces facing the ventral surface of the female, 
as an adaptation to package the greatest number of 
larvae in the least amount of space, as well as to 
prevent premature displacement of young from the 
brood pouch (Wortham-Neal and Price, 2002). 
 
5.2.1 Age and growth 
 
Embryonic development of the eggs of broadcast 
spawners is, on average, 35 hours (11°C) for 
E. pacifica and T. spinifera, 40 hours for the sac-
spawning species N. difficilis along the Oregon 
coast  (Gómez-Gutiérrez, 2002, 2003a,b), and 72 
hours (16°C) for N. simplex from the waters 
around the southwestern part of the Baja 
California peninsula (Gómez-Gutiérrez and 
Robinson, 2005).  Results have shown that larval 
development time (larvae to juveniles), measured 
under laboratory conditions for E. pacifica (Ross, 
1981; Feinberg et al., 2003), is delayed about 45 
days at 12°C and 68 days at 8°C, and for 
Nyctiphanes simplex, about 58 days at 14°C 
(Lavaniegos, 1992).  Euphausiids grow throughout 
their lifespan and molt every 3 to 8 days; the 
molting process depends mostly on the 
temperature, but not on the amount of food eaten 
(Lasker, 1966).  Several laboratory and field 
studies indicate that body shrinkage is common, 
and in Antarctic krill, could possibly be an over-
wintering mechanism for reducing metabolic 
demand when food is scarce (Hosie and Ritz, 
1989; Dalpadado and Ikeda, 1989; Nicol, 2000; 
Shin and Nicol, 2002).  In the North Pacific, the 
only species that has been observed for shrinkage 
is E. pacifica (along the California coast), which 
can survive periods of abnormally high 
temperatures (such as El Niño events) by 
shrinking between molts, even if food is plentiful 
(Marinovic and Mangel, 1999).  The authors also 
note a high degree of individual variability in 
growth rates.  This complicates the accurate 
estimation of age and growth rates, using 
conventional cohort analysis.  However, even with 
its inherent limitations, cohort analysis remains the 
most practical way to estimate field growth rates 
in recent publications (Lavaniegos, 1995; Gómez-
Gutiérrez et al., 1996; De Silva-Davila and 
Palomares-García, 1998; Iguchi and Ikeda, 2004). 
Concentration of lipofuscin, a metabolic by-
product that accumulates with age, shows a linear 
association with age (from specimens spawned 
and reared under laboratory conditions), but not 
with total length, in which there is a high 
individual variability in E. pacifica and T. 
spinifera (Ju and Harvey, 2002).  Maximum age 
and growth patterns of E. pacifica have been 
investigated for some local populations in the 
North Pacific and have been shown to vary 
regionally.  The maximum age ranges from 6–8 
months (southern California) to 2+ years 
(northwestern Pacific) (Brinton, 1976; Siegel, 
2000a), and mean daily growth rates range from 
0.000 (no growth) to 0.096 mm d
–1
, with large 
seasonal and interannual differences (Siegel and 
Nicol, 2000).  The prolonged maximum age and 
low growth rate are believed to be due to low 
water temperatures in the winter and depletion of 
their food supply (mainly phytoplankton).   
 
The growth pattern of T. longipes was studied off 
Kamchatka Peninsula (Nemoto, 1957), the west 
coast of British Columbia, Canada (Fulton and 
LeBrasseur, 1984), and on Yamoto Rise, central 
Japan/East Sea (Iguchi and Ikeda, 2004).  For the 
Kamchatka population (group A in Nemoto, 
1957), sexual differences in growth rate (higher in 
females) were observed, and spawning occurred at 
the age of 2+ years.  The daily growth rates of the 
42 
population off the west coast of Canada were 
0.015 mm, or 0.28% of wet weight.  Samples from 
the central Japan/East Sea included at least three 
cohorts consisting of individuals aged 0+, 1+, and 
2+.  Fitting a von Bertalanffy growth equation to 
mean body length-at-age indicated that maximum 
body length is reached 3 years after hatching 
(Iguchi and Ikeda, 2004).  The maximum ages of 
T. inermis around the Aleutian Islands and T. 
spinifera off British Columbia were 2 to 3+ years 
(Siegel, 2000a).  In the southeastern Bering Sea, 
the daily growth rate of the populations of T. 
inermis and T. raschi was estimated to be about 
2% of dry weight (Smith, 1991). 
 
Measurements of euphausiid growth rates are 
lacking for all bathypelagic and mesopelagic 
species, and for most of the euphausiids in the 
Central Pacific.  Most growth rates are calculated 
from cohort analysis of juveniles and adult stages 
because development times of larvae from 
nauplius-to-furcilia stages (<1 month), estimated 
under laboratory conditions, are typically much 
shorter than the frequency of zooplankton 
sampling.  Even relatively high frequency 
sampling programs (e.g., biweekly) are not 
suitable for tracking cohorts in order to estimate 
larval growth rates of E. pacifica and T. spinifera 
(Feinberg and Peterson, 2003).  Thus, growth rate 
estimation of euphausiid larvae must be made 
from laboratory incubations (Ross, 1981; 
Lavaniegos, 1992). 
 
5.2.2 Production 
 
Production of crustaceans is defined as the sum of 
growth increments of the individuals pertaining to 
one population, eggs and molts included, during a 
period of time (Ritz and Hosie, 1982; Lavaniegos, 
1995; Iguchi and Ikeda, 1999).  Most estimates of 
euphausiid production are derived using body 
growth from cohort analysis, but eggs and molts 
are much less frequently studied (Hosie and Ritz, 
1983).  Lasker (1966) estimated that the egg 
production from a broadcast spawner (E. pacifica) 
accounts for 15% of the total secondary 
productivity, and Lavaniegos (1995) reported that 
the total secondary production for a sac spawner 
(N. simplex), is partitioned as 75% for body 
growth, 23% for molts, and 2% for egg 
production.  The annual P/B ratio derived from the 
growth of E. pacifica was investigated in the 
waters off southern California (Lasker, 1966), in 
Saanich Inlet, British Columbia (Heath, 1977), off 
Oregon (Mauchline, 1977), off British Columbia 
(Tanasichuk 1998a), and in Toyama Bay, southern 
Japan/East Sea (Iguchi and Ikeda, 1999).  The 
annual P/B ratio is highly variable among these 
regional populations: 2.6 for Saanich Inlet (re-
calculated), 8.7 off Oregon, 11.0 (range 6.4–16.7) 
off British Columbia (calculated from Table 4 in 
Tanasichuk, 1998a), and 3.8 for Toyama Bay.   
 
Such regional variations within the same species 
are due to differences in growth rates and patterns 
during their 1-year life cycle, and have also been 
reported for N. simplex living in western (P/B ratio 
= 12.7, Lavaniegos, 1995) and southwestern 
waters of Baja California peninsula (7.0, Gómez-
Gutiérrez et al., 1996).  De Silva-Dávila et al. 
(2002) reported that variability of P/B ratios of 
N. simplex along Baja California during February 
1994 does not exhibit a simple latitudinal trend as 
would be expected (15.3 at Bahía Vizcaíno 
(28.5°N), 21.2 at Punta Abreojos (26°N), and 16.1 
at Bahía Magdalena (24.5°N)), but higher 
productions are typically found in upwelling 
regions associated with topographic prominences. 
The P/B ratios of this species could be strongly 
biased if the population is not completely sampled 
(for example, by including mostly daytime 
samples that are biased for larvae and juveniles), 
leading to unusually high P/B values (De Silva-
Dávila and Palomares-García, 1998). 
 
The annual P/B ratio of T. spinifera off British 
Columbia was reported to be 19.5 (range 11.1–
35.0, Tanasichuk, 1998b).  However, P/B ratios 
are highly dependent on the method of sampling 
(size-bias), preservation (preserved versus dry 
weight from fresh animals), the size frequency 
distribution of the samples (number of euphausiids 
measured), and frequency of the sampling to 
estimate growth rates.  High P/B ratios (>20) are 
usually reported in studies where larvae and 
juveniles dominate the population composition, 
perhaps resulting in overestimates of the overall 
population P/B ratio.  Because relatively recent 
experimental estimations of instantaneous growth 
rates have reflected the in situ nutritional history 
of the previous intermolt period (Ross et al., 
2000), the development of new and better egg 
43 
production incubation techniques (Ross and 
Quetin, 2000), and the physiological capability of 
the euphausiid to shrink under a relatively wide 
range of environmental conditions, it is expected 
that future studies will use more carefully the 
information from cohort analysis and avoid 
assuming a priori the euphausiid’s vital rates to 
estimate euphausiid secondary productivity. 
 
5.2.3 Reproduction and early life history 
 
The reproductive patterns and population 
fecundity of euphausiids has been thoroughly 
described by Ross and Quetin (2000).  However, 
this review includes mostly broadcast spawning 
species subject to fishery activity.  Siegel (2000a) 
has reviewed the development of euphausiid 
larvae.  In the North Pacific, however, the bulk of 
information on reproduction is restricted to 
E. pacifica (Feinberg and Peterson, 2003).  The 
timing and duration of spawning in E. pacifica is 
flexible, and a link between the spring bloom, or 
period of upwelling, and the length and intensity 
of spawning has been suggested (Ross and Quetin, 
2000).  Hatching success of E. pacifica is high 
(>96%) in the temperature range of 1–20°C, but 
falls to 70% at 22°C, and only to 1.1% at 25°C 
(Iguchi and Ikeda, 1994).  Comparison of three 
broadcast spawning species (E. pacifica, T. 
spinifera, and T. inspinata) and one sac spawning 
species (N. difficilis) indicates that all have similar 
egg developmental rates and hatching times 
(<40 hours) at the same temperature (11°C) 
(Gómez-Gutiérrez, 2002, 2003a,b).  The 
assumption that the developmental time of eggs 
for N. simplex is 30 days (Lavaniegos, 1995) is 
perhaps an overestimation, particularly in regions 
with higher temperatures (15–21°C).  Thus, the 
total fecundity of this species (33 mg m
–2
 yr
-1
) may 
be substantially underestimated.  Gómez-Gutiérrez 
and Robinson (2005) observed an interbrood 
period of N. simplex, ranging between 7 and 16 
days under shipboard incubations (16°C), in the 
southern part of Baja California, and found that it 
was significantly smaller than the interbrood 
period assumed by Lavaniegos (1995).  This 
indicates that the fecundity of this species was 
underestimated by between ¼ and ½ of the 
expected value obtained from direct observation of 
the interbrood period.  Thus, whereas Lavaniegos 
(1995) calculated that egg production contributed 
about 2% of the total secondary productivity, 
using the recently observed interbrood periods, 
egg production would be expected to contribute 
about 7% of the total secondary productivity of 
this species. 
 
The hatching success of species inhabiting the 
North Pacific has been studied in E. pacifica, and 
most recently in T. spinifera, and may be 
attributed not only to high female-to-female 
variability, but may also be partly due to 
temperature (Iguchi and Ikeda, 1994; Gómez-
Gutiérrez, 2002).  Gómez-Gutiérrez (2002, 2003b) 
observed hatching mechanisms of three broadcast 
spawning euphausiids (E. pacifica, T. spinifera, 
and T. inspinata) and a sac spawning species 
(N. difficilis) off Oregon.  Delayed egg hatching 
schedules in broadcast spawning species were 
promoted by low temperatures (<8°C), and both 
early and delayed egg hatching times were 
associated with relatively lower hatching success 
and brood size compared to eggs that hatched at a 
normal larvae stage (first nauplius stage (N1) for 
broadcast and metanauplius (MN) for sac 
spawning species).  
 
5.2.4 Mortality 
 
Euphausiid mortality rates estimated from field 
samples are scarce.  For E. pacifica in the North 
Pacific, mortality ranges from z = 0.4 to 8.7, 
depending on developmental stage and region 
(Siegel 2000a).  In southern California waters, 
Brinton (1976) reported an average survivorship of 
16% during the 1-month furcilia larval phase, 67% 
for juveniles (6–9 mm), and 60–64% for young 
adults (9–18 mm).  Egg mortality is expected to be 
higher for broadcast spawners than for sac 
spawners due post-spawning predation, losses to 
the seabed (caused by egg sinking), and transport 
by currents to unfavorable areas.  There are no 
quantitative estimates of egg mortality in the field. 
However, the mortality of E. pacifica embryos has 
been associated with malformation during the 
development of the embryo (15% of individuals), 
protozoan parasitism (5%), and failure of embryos 
to hatch (2%) (Gómez-Gutiérrez, unpubl. data). 
Only recently has it become recognized that 
euphausiids have a considerable flexibility in their 
hatching mechanism.  Gómez-Gutiérrez (2002, 
2003a,b) and Gómez-Gutiérrez and Robinson 
44 
(2005) reported that broadcast spawner 
(E. pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera and T. 
inspinata) and sac spawner (Nematoscelis difficilis 
and Nyctiphanes simplex) species have different 
hatching mechanisms and different patterns of 
hatching success.  
 
Gómez-Gutiérrez et al. (2003) reported a mass 
mortality of E. pacifica by an apostome parasitoid 
ciliate in the California Current System in the 
summer of 2001.  The epizootic character of the 
observed euphausiid mortality challenges the 
widely held notion that mortality in pelagic 
organisms can be attributed primarily to predation 
and starvation.  Because these parasitoid ciliates 
have been recorded in other euphausiids in the 
Bering Sea (T. inermis) and off the Oregon–
Washington coasts (T. spinifera, T. gregaria), and 
because of the difficulty in detecting the infected 
euphausiids in preserved samples, it is therefore 
suspected that this kind of infection may occur in 
other euphausiids from the North Pacific as well.  
In March 2004, an apostome parasitoid ciliate that 
infected and killed the most abundant euphausiid 
(Nyctiphanes simplex) of the southern part of the 
California Current System and the Gulf of 
California was discovered (Gómez-Gutiérrez and 
Robinson, 2004).  This is the first observation of a 
ciliate parasitoid infection in a sac-spawning 
euphausiid species. Preliminary observations 
suggest those parasitoid ciliates may compete for 
the same resource (euphausiids) with more 
conventional stenophagous euphausiid predators 
like the blue whale Balaenoptera musculus, whale 
shark Rhincodon typus, mantas Mobula japonica 
and Mobula thurstoni), and juvenile stages of 
squids (Dosidicus gigas).  Other parasites, 
although they do not kill euphausiids, may 
significantly affect their health.  For example, the 
helminth Anasakis simplex, which infects T. raschi 
(Hays et al., 1998), has also been observed in E. 
pacifica and N. simplex (Gómez-Gutiérrez, pers. 
observ.) occupying most of the carapace and 
abdomen space, and it is believed that euphausiids 
are the intermediate host of this kind of parasite.  
The Dajidae parasites that infect Stylocheiron and 
Nematoscelis species in the California Current 
System and South China Sea have also been noted; 
they apparently castrate their host and can infect 
euphausiids even in juvenile stages (Shields and 
Gómez-Gutiérrez, 1996; Gómez-Gutiérrez and 
Shields, 1998). 
 
5.3 Cephalopod Micronekton 
   
Life history characteristics common to pelagic 
squids include early and/or semelparous breeding, 
rapid growth, a short lifespan, little overlap of 
generations, and vulnerability to environmental 
variables (Boyle and Boletsky, 1996).   
 
5.3.1 Age and growth 
   
It is generally held that cephalopods are fast 
growing animals which reproduce once and then 
die (semelparous).  Usually, most species do not 
live longer than one year.  Few studies have been 
conducted on age and growth for species in the 
PICES region.  The lifespan of Watasenia 
scintillans has been estimated to be between 12–
13 months for females and 11–12 months for 
males (Hayashi, 1993).  Onychoteuthis 
borealijaponica has been reported to have a 
lifespan of 1 year (Murata and Ishii, 1977), but 
only a fraction of this occurs in the micronekton.  
Insight into the growth of enoploteuthin squids 
might be extracted from statolith-based age and 
growth studies on pelagic young (paralarvae) 
Abralia trigonura in Hawaiian waters, where they 
grew exponentially at a rate of 5.9% mantle length 
(ML) d
–1
 for approxiamtely 40 days post-hatching, 
while post-paralarvae exhibited slower growth 
(Bigelow, 1992).  Statolith microstructural 
analysis and exponential growth models suggest 
that growth in length was similar (0.80% ML d
–1
) 
for male and female Onychoteuthis 
borealijaponica, while increase in weight was 
higher for females (1.9% WT d
–1
) than for males 
(1.4% WT d
–1
) (Bigelow, 1994).  Yatsu (2000) 
presented estimates of age and growth for the 
ommastrephid species O. bartramii, 
Symplectoteuthis oualaniensis, and Dosidicus 
gigas, based on statolith microstructure.  
Relationships between ML and age were 
exponential during early life stages, and almost 
linear for subadults and adults. 
   
5.3.2 Production 
 
No production estimates for cephalopod 
micronekton are available.  
45 
5.3.3 Reproduction and early life history 
 
Reproduction in cephalopods has been 
comprehensively reviewed in Mangold (1987).  
Pelagic squids that dominate the micronektonic 
cephalopods are “semelparous” but there also 
appears to be a very high degree of flexibility in 
“semelparity”, ranging from one exhaustive 
spawning followed by death, to repeated egg-
laying episodes that resemble “iteroparity”.  Lack 
of nidamental glands (which help to produce egg 
masses) in enoploteuthins suggests that these 
squids release eggs singly (surrounded only by 
oviducal jelly) rather than in clumped masses 
(Young and Harman, 1985; Young et al., 1985).  
Oceanic squid generally have planktonic young 
(paralarvae) which are typically confined to the 
near-surface waters (0–200 m); paralarval squid 
spend an unknown length of time in the plankton 
and then typically descend to an adult habitat in 
the mesopelagic (400–1200 m) or bathypelagic 
(>1200 m) zone.  
  
5.3.4 Mortality 
  
Natural mortality, which includes catastrophic and 
post-spawning mortality, predator-prey related 
deaths, and cannibalism is difficult to quantify in 
the field.  For short-lived animals, such as pelagic 
cephalopods, estimations of natural mortality 
become even more subjective and, at present, are 
nonexistent for micronektonic cephalopods.

6. Ecological Relations 
 
Much of the following section on feeding is based 
on the review by Moku and Hidaka (2002).  Since 
the term “micronekton” was proposed to express 
the animal groups between plankton and nekton in 
terms of swimming ability (Marshall, 1954), their 
ecological roles in the oceanic ecosystems have 
been stressed and recognized as important to 
trophically connect zooplankton with carnivorous 
nekton, mainly because of their potential huge 
biomass.  Micronekton includes larger-sized 
crustaceans, such as euphausiids, shrimps, and 
mysids, small fishes and squids, most of which 
dwell in the mesopelagic zone and are diel vertical 
migrants.  
 
All large oceanic fishes and squids of substantial 
commercial value also pass through a 
micronektonic stage during their early life history 
stages.  In this regard, scientific interests have 
been raised regarding the potential for competition 
between “true” micronekton and the juveniles or 
adults of commercial fishes.  As competitors, 
vertically migrating micronekton are considered to 
merit future study because of their high abundance 
and productivity depending on diel feeding 
migration to the euphotic zone.  Knowledge of the 
dynamic aspects of their feeding habits, however, 
has been restricted due to lack of quantitative 
sampling methods.  Here, we review the existing 
literature for North Pacific populations, as well as 
for populations in other oceans, in order to extract 
the key points directing future studies. 
 
6.1  Feeding Habits  
 
There are several methodological difficulties in 
quantitatively assessing the food habits of 
mesopelagic organisms.  A recurring problem is 
that of post-capture ingestion in the codend of 
most nets (Hopkins and Baird, 1975; Lancraft and 
Robison, 1980).  In a comparison of the feeding 
habits of net-caught Sergestes similis with those 
collected in albacore stomachs, Judkins and 
Fleminger (1972) found strong evidence for 
codend feeding on fish scales, copepods, and 
euphausiids.  Thus, caution must be exercised 
when considering the diets of these midwater 
species collected in lengthy trawls.  Another 
problem is the potential for regurgitation of 
stomach contents, especially for fish with swim 
bladders, brought up from the deep ocean.  This is 
likely to lead to underestimates of daily ration and 
potential bias in diet composition. 
 
6.1.1 Fish micronekton 
 
Considerable knowledge has accumulated on the 
feeding habits of micronekton, but in many cases 
these analyses have been qualitative rather than 
quantitative.  Myctophid fishes are always one of 
the most abundant groups of micronektonic 
animals in the world oceans (Maynard et al., 1975; 
Hopkins and Lancraft, 1984).  As expected (given 
their propensity for DVM behavior), studies of 
myctophid feeding patterns suggest increased 
feeding at night.  Up to 40 prey species have been 
found in stomachs of the abundant planktivorous 
mesopelagic fishes in the North Pacific Ocean. 
Copepods show the highest species diversity 
among prey organisms (Paxton, 1968; Pearcy et 
al., 1979a; Adams, 1979; Gordon et al., 1985; 
Balanov et al., 1994, 1995a).  Owing to their large 
mouths, relatively scarce and serrated gill rakers, 
well-developed stomach, and short intestine, 
myctophids consume predominantly actively-
moving prey (copepods, euphausiids, etc.), 
whereas deep-sea smelts (bathylagids) which have 
a small mouth, dense and flat gill rakers, weakly-
developed stomach, and long digestive tract are 
generally adapted to consume slow-moving 
animals such as jellyfish, larvaceans, ctenophores, 
and pteropods (Gorelova and Kobylanskiy, 1985; 
Ebeling and Cailliet, 1990; Balanov et al., 1994). 
 
The main prey taxa of myctophids are crustacean 
zooplankton, such as copepods, euphausiids, 
amphipods, and ostracods (Hopkins and Gartner, 
1992; Gartner et al., 1997; Moku et al., 2000). 
Some specialized genera or species, however, are 
known to select their prey or broaden their prey 
animal groups.  For example, species of the genus 
Centrobranchus are specialists that feed on 
gelatinous plankton such as pteropods and 
appendicularians (Gorelova, 1977; Hopkins and 
Gartner, 1992), while fishes in the genus 
Ceratoscopelus feed not only on crustaceans but 
also on appendicularians, salps and 
ichthyoplankton, and occasionally even on large 
48 
diatoms (Duka, 1987; Kinzer and Schulz, 1985; 
Robison, 1984).  
 
In the family Myctophidae, feeding habits have 
been extensively studied for Stenobrachius 
leucopsarus, one of the most common 
mesopelagic fishes in the North Pacific.  In all 
areas, this species consumes mainly copepods, 
amphipods, and euphausiids.  In the Bering Sea, 
the most important prey species are the euphausiid 
Thysanoessa longipes, and the copepods 
Neocalanus cristatus, Eucalanus bungii, and 
Paraeuchaeta elongata (Balanov, 1994; Balanov 
et al., 1994).  In the Pacific waters off North 
America, Euphausia pacifica, Calanus spp., 
Neocalanus plumchrus, Metridia lucens, Themisto 
pacifica, and Hyperia galba are their main prey 
(Tyler and Pearcy, 1975; Pearcy et al., 1979a; 
Ebeling and Cailliet, 1990).  In the Pacific waters 
off northern Japan, the major prey are E. pacifica, 
T. longipes, M. pacifica, and N. plumchrus 
(Gordon et al., 1985; Moku et al., 2000). 
 
In the stomachs of Stenobrachius nannochir, 
calanoid copepods predominate.  The most 
frequently consumed copepod species are 
N. cristatus, P. elongata, Gaidius variabilis, and 
P. pacifica (Gordon et al., 1985; Balanov et al., 
1994; Moku et al., 2000).  This species consumes 
euphausiids, amphipods, and small decapods in 
considerable quantities (up to 10–20% of the total 
ration) only in the mesopelagic zone of the 
Okhotsk Sea (Il’insky and Gorbatenko, 1994).  
 
In the North Pacific waters off Kamchatka, off 
North America, and off northern Japan, the bulk of 
the diet of Diaphus theta consists of euphausiids, 
copepods, and amphipods; the predominant prey 
items are E. pacifica, Metridia lucens, M. 
okhotensis, and Themisto pacifica (Tyler and 
Pearcy, 1975; Gordon et al., 1985; Moku et al., 
2000). In the stomachs of Tarletonbeania 
crenularis in the same areas, the predominant 
species are the euphausiid E. pacifica, and the 
copepods M. lucens, N. plumchrus, N. cristatus, 
and Candacia columbiae (Tyler and Pearcy, 1975; 
Kawamura and Fujii, 1988). 
 
Among fishes of the family Microstomatidae, the 
most abundant species in the North Pacific are 
Leuroglossus schmidti and Lipolagus ochotensis. 
These species are found throughout the entire 
North Pacific, and in the mesopelagic zone of the 
Okhotsk Sea, they occupy the dominant position 
among the mesopelagic fishes (Balanov and 
Il’insky, 1992; Il’insky and Gorbatenko, 1994).  
Medusae, ctenophores, and larvaceans are 
dominant components in the diet of both species in 
the Bering Sea and the Pacific waters off northern 
Japan.  For L. schmidti, euphausiids and copepods 
constitute the greater part of the ration 
(Gorbatenko and Il’insky, 1992; Balanov, 1994; 
Balanov et al., 1994).  In the Okhotsk Sea, 
L. schmidti consumes predominantly euphausiids 
and amphipods.  Gelatinous zooplankton are most 
prevalent in the diet of L. ochotensis (Il’insky and 
Gorbatenko, 1994).  Leuroglossus schmidti 
actively feeds on euphausiids, amphipods, or 
copepods at night in the epipelagic zone (0–
200 m), whereas jellyfish and other soft-bodied 
animals prevail in stomachs of this species in the 
upper mesopelagic zone (200–500 m) (Balanov et 
al., 1994, 1995a).  Thus, it appears that L. schmidti 
feeds as a typical myctophid in the epipelagic 
region and as a typical deep-sea smelt in the upper 
mesopelagic region. Apparently, the concentration 
of prey organisms in the epipelagic area of the 
Bering Sea is sufficient for L. schmidti (which is 
adapted to feed on slow-moving organisms) to 
consume them in large numbers (Balanov et al., 
1994).  The same is true for the mesopelagic zone 
of the Okhotsk Sea where euphausiids and 
amphipods are abundant enough to contribute 
substantially to the diet of L. schmidti (Il’insky 
and Gorbatenko, 1994). 
 
In early studies, most myctophids were usually 
characterized as “opportunistic” feeders that 
filtered water with well-developed gill rakers 
(Marshall, 1979).  However, more recent studies 
have revealed evidence of resource partitioning 
(by both species and by size) for many species, 
together with habitat segregation by species and 
size (Merrett and Roe, 1974; Clarke, 1980; 
Hopkins and Gartner, 1992; Moku et al., 2000; 
Watanabe et al., 2002).  This difference in results 
is due mainly to the recent development of 
discrete-depth sampling methods and the 
collection of sufficiently large sample sizes at 
higher spatial and temporal resolution.  Recently, 
resource partitioning has also been recognized for 
49 
larval myctophid fish communities (Sabates and 
Saiz, 2000; Sassa and Kawaguchi, 2004). 
 
In the subarctic and transitional regions, seasonal 
changes in species composition and biomass of the 
epipelagic zooplankton are due to the vertical 
migrations of crustaceans, especially copepods 
such as Neocalanus, related to their ontogenetic 
vertical migration and diapause in summer (Miller 
et al., 1984; Batchelder, 1985; Odate, 1994; 
Kobari and Ikeda, 1999). This change in 
zooplankton assemblage is reflected in prey 
species composition of the subarctic and TrZ 
myctophids.  For example, the occurrence ratios of 
euphausiids in myctophid stomachs are known to 
vary with the seasonal change in euphausiid 
abundance (Collard, 1970; Cailliet and Ebeling, 
1990; Balanov et al., 1995a). There is a seasonal 
change in the general pattern of dominant prey 
species in stomachs of the most abundant 
mesopelagic fishes in the North Pacific. Copepods 
predominate in winter, later spring, and summer, 
whereas euphausiids are the dominant group in 
late summer and autumn (Adams, 1979; Pearcy et 
al., 1979; Gordon et al., 1985; Cailliet and 
Ebeling, 1990).  In the Bering Sea in spring and 
summer, copepods (primarily N. cristatus) are 
dominant in the diet of myctophids both in the 
epipelagic (0–200 m) and in the upper 
mesopelagic (200–500 m) zones.  In autumn and 
winter, N. cristatus is predominantly found in the 
stomachs of fish from the upper and lower (500–
1000 m) mesopelagic zones (Balanov, 1994; 
Balanov et al., 1995a). 
 
However, tropical and subtropical myctophids 
seem to show no clear seasonal change in their 
prey composition, presumably reflecting the low 
seasonality in zooplankton community and 
biomass at lower latitudes (Dalpadado and 
Gjøsaeter, 1988).  The knowledge of seasonal and 
regional changes in prey species related with 
change of zooplankton community is restricted 
and spatio-temporally fragmental (North Pacific: 
Collard, 1970; Cailliet and Ebeling, 1990; Bering 
Sea: Balanov et al., 1995a,b; Atlantic: Gjøsaeter, 
1973; Indian Ocean: Dalpadado and Gjøsaeter, 
1988).  
Ontogenetic changes in feeding habits and prey 
size are readily apparent in most mesopelagic 
fishes.  Generally, copepods dominate as prey 
(with a size shift from nauplii to copepodite stages 
with growth from larvae to adults), and later are 
partly replaced with larger crustaceans, such as 
euphausiids.  However, most myctophids continue 
to consume copepods of various sizes throughout 
their life, although their relative importance 
decreases among the larger-sized myctophids (e.g., 
those reaching 10 cm or more) that begin feeding 
on small squids and fishes (Gjøsaeter, 1973; 
Hopkins and Baird, 1985; Kinzer, 1977; Clarke, 
1980; Hopkins and Gartner, 1992).  Recently, the 
feeding habits of two dominant myctophid larvae, 
Diaphus garmani and Myctophum asperum, were 
studied in the transition region of the western 
North Pacific.  The former depends mainly on 
appendicularian houses and copepod nauplii, while 
the latter feeds mainly on ostracods and 
polychaetes.  It was concluded that competition for 
prey among these myctophid larvae and co-
existing Japanese anchovy larvae is unlikely 
because of diet and habitat depth segregation 
(Sassa and Kawaguchi, 2004). 
 
The diel feeding habits of myctophids are closely 
related with their vertical migration patterns.  In 
the tropical and subtropical waters, they show 
clear feeding periodicity, feeding mainly at night 
in the epipelagic zone (Baird et al., 1975; Clarke, 
1978; Kinzer and Schulz, 1985; Watanabe et al., 
2002; Fig. 6.1).  In the subarctic, transitional, 
upwelling and slope water areas (where 
considerable zooplankton biomass is distributed in 
the mesopelagic zone), many myctophids feed 
both at night and during the daytime (Paxton, 
1967a; Samyshev and Schetinkin, 1971; Young 
and Blaber, 1986; Moku et al., 2000).  The few 
studies on the feeding periodicity of 
S. leucopsarus in the North Pacific have revealed 
no pronounced rhythms in food consumption. 
Based on the diel distribution of different stages of 
food digestion and stomach fullness, it has been 
reported that this species feeds mainly in the 
morning and at night, although the possibility of 
feeding during the daytime cannot totally be ruled 
out (Tyler and Pearcy, 1975; Ebeling and Cailliet, 
1990).  Most of the common mesopelagic fishes of 
the Bering Sea exhibit well-defined feeding 
rhythms related to the vertical migrations of both 
fish and zooplankton.

Fig. 6.1 Relationship among the main prey categories, their sizes, and feeding peaks for four juvenile 
surface migratory myctophid fishes, Myctophum asperum, Symbolophorus evermanni, Myctophum 
nitidulum, and Centrobranchus brevirostris in the Kuroshio region of the western North Pacific. 
 
Many species show two peaks of stomach fullness: 
one at night between 2200 and 0400 h in the 
epipelagic zone (0–200 m) and another during the 
day between 1000 and 1600 h in the upper 
mesopelagic zone (200–500 m).  High stomach 
fullness, maximal content of fresh food, and 
minimal proportion of empty stomachs were found 
during these consumption periods.  In the 500–
1000 m layer, no distinct rhythm of food 
consumption was found, although digested food 
prevailed in the stomachs of fish in this layer and 
the proportion of empty stomachs was highest 
(Balanov, 1994; Balanov et al., 1994; Balanov et 
al., 1995a,b).  Pronounced feeding periodicity has 
been reported for S. leucopsarus and D. theta off 
northern Japan (Moku et al., 2000).  Existing 
knowledge on the feeding habits of non-migratory 
mesopelagic stomiatoid fishes is currently 
restricted to those occurring in Hawaiian waters 
(Clarke, 1982). 
Recently, an interdecadal change (between 1964–
1999) in the diet of a surface-migrating myctophid 
(Myctophum nitidulum) was reported in the 
Kuroshio region (Watanabe and Kawaguchi, 
2003a).  These authors pointed out that predation 
on Japanese sardine larvae by M. nitidulum 
occurred during the peak period of the sardine 
stock from 1976–1990, and they estimated that 
0.24 (± 0.14) to 0.52 (± 0.31) sardine larvae per 
meter cubed were consumed by M. nitidulum 
every night in January and February during these 
years.  
 
6.1.2 Crustacean micronekton 
 
Many studies using a variety of methods have tried 
to quantify the diets of euphausiids.  Since the 
food entering the euphausiid stomach has already 
been thoroughly masticated by the mandibles, 
identification of gut contents is extremely difficult, 
51 
with the exception of copepod mandibles.  
Mauchline (1967) reviewed the morphology of 
feeding appendages of all the genera of 
euphausiids, separating genera typically 
carnivorous (Nematoscelis, Nematobrachion), 
with larger space among setae of the feeding 
appendages, to genera that are mostly herbivores, 
with dense setae along the periopods 
(Nyctiphanes).  More specifically, Mauchline and 
Fisher (1969) have reviewed early studies of food 
items of euphausiids, which included some 
common North Pacific euphausiid species 
E. pacifica, T. longipes, T. inermis, and T. raschi 
and divided their feeding modes into three classes:  
(1) those which eat diatoms, dinoflagellates and 
tintinnids filtered from the water by mouthparts, 
(2) those which feed on zooplankton, and (3) those 
which feed on detrital material obtained from 
bottom sediments.  The stomach contents of three 
bathypelagic giant Thysanopoda are usually 
dominated by copepods, chaetognaths, and in less 
proportion, by euphausiids, amphipods, mysids, 
and pelagic shrimps (Nemoto, 1977).  He 
considered that Thysanopoda egregia is the most 
voracious euphausiid, preying on micronektonic 
fishes, and even oceanic squid larva.  Strong 
solitary spines and setae that are typical of 
carnivorous euphausiids are found along the inner 
side of the stomach wall.  There are no clusters of 
spines, such as those found in the stomach walls of 
typically herbivorous euphausiids.  Hamner (1988) 
reviewed the filtering mechanisms of the genus 
Euphausia, describing that the thoracic 
appendages of particle-feeding euphausiids bear 
long, anteriorly-directed setae forming a filter 
basket (closed basket).  This fills from the front, 
beneath the antennae, when the legs are opened. 
During opening, the filter surface is covered by the 
exopods (outer legs) to keep water from moving in 
through the screen. 
 
In the North Pacific, knowledge on the feeding 
habits of euphausiids is restricted mainly to 
E. pacifica because this species has received 
considerable attention in order to understand its 
role in organic matter transfer in marine 
ecosystems.  Examination of the gut contents of 
E. pacifica larvae (calyptopis stage), using 
scanning electron microscopy, revealed a diet 
composed entirely of amorphous organic detritus, 
crustacean remains, and inorganic particles (Suh et 
al., 1991).  As for the adults, comparative 
morphology of the feeding basket and gut of five 
species in the North Pacific suggested that E. 
pacifica is more adapted to herbivorous feeding 
(Mauchline, 1967; Suh and Choi, 1998).  
However, Ohman (1984) reported that E. pacifica 
is omnivorous, based on laboratory experiments in 
which they were fed different prey types (diatoms 
and copepods), and found that copepods seemed to 
be the less preferred prey item.  He also noted, 
however, that this species switched easily from 
herbivory to carnivory, according to the relative 
food availability.  Off eastern Japan, copepods 
proved to be the most important food item in terms 
of carbon, suggesting that E. pacifica does, indeed, 
switch its feeding behavior (suspension feeding on 
phytoplankton and raptorial feeding on small 
copepods) according to the ambient phytoplankton 
abundance (Nakagawa et al., 2001; Taki et al., 
2002).  
 
In addition to these traditionally well known main 
food items, it is known that E. pacifica can also 
feed on marine snow (particles > 0.5 mm 
diameter) with relatively high efficiency, even 
when other sources of food are provided (Dilling 
et al., 1998; Dilling and Brzezinski, 2004), and 
probably also feeds on protozoans (Stoecker and 
Capuzzo, 1990).  Dilling and Brzezinski (2004) 
developed a new ingenious method to track food
 
sources by labeling the frustules of aggregated 
Nitzschia angularis cells with different
 
naturally 
occurring, but rare, stable isotopes of silicon (
30
Si
 
and 
29
Si).  Euphausia pacifica consumed both 
aggregates and dispersed
 
cells, even when more 
cells were made available in dispersed
 
form than 
in aggregated form.  This suggests that aggregates
 
may, indeed, be a food source for euphausiids in 
the field, even when dispersed
 
cells are relatively 
abundant.  Marine snow is a significant sinking 
source of carbon, from the pelagic realm to deeper 
layers of the ocean, and euphausiids are capable of 
fragmenting a single aggregate of marine snow 
into multiple, smaller aggregates by fluid stress 
created around the appendages during swimming, 
thus significantly reducing marine snow sinking 
rates and decreasing the carbon loss from the 
highly productive epipelagic layer (Dilling and 
Alldredge, 2000; Goldthwait et al., 2004).  
However, Ponomareva et al. (1974) was perhaps 
the first to develop experiments for the 
52 
determination of the assimilability of algae and 
bacteria (n = 7) in euphausiids (tropical species 
Euphausia diomedeae, Thysanopoda tricuspidata 
and E. brevis), recording that feeding rates of 
euphausiids on phytoplankton and bacteria were 
very low.  According to the authors, E. diomedae 
consumes bacteria aggregated on particles in 
larger amounts than single cells, and its rates of 
assimilation of phytoplankton and bacteria are 
fairly high.  
 
Finally, E. pacifica, and several other euphausiid 
species from the region, may also be one of the 
most important predators on the early stages of 
anchovy (eggs and yolk-sac larvae) off southern 
California (Theilacker and Lasker, 1973; 
Theilacker et al., 1986; Theilacker et al., 1993).  
Similarly, T. spinifera and T. inermis have been 
shown to be important predators on the early 
stages of walleye pollock in the Gulf of Alaska 
(Bailey et al., 1993; Brodeur and Merati, 1993).  
 
Bargu et al. (2003) reviewed the effect of toxic 
phytoplankton on euphausiids, reporting that the 
smaller E. pacifica has bigger weight-specific 
ingestion and higher filtration rates than the larger 
T. spinifera, but both feed at similar rates from 
toxic and non-toxic Pseudo-nitzschia 
phytoplankton.  They did not observe an 
immediate effect by toxic Pseudo-nitzschia on 
both species.  However, like in copepods, it is 
expected that toxic phytoplankton should affect 
primarily the brood size and/or hatching success of 
euphausiid embryos rather than cause mortality of 
the juveniles or adults.  
 
The daytime feeding activity of E. pacifica in 
northeastern Japan is low even when food 
organisms are abundant in the top 50 m of the 
ocean.  Thus, the feeding rhythm of this species is 
explained by decreased feeding activity during the 
day, rather than by reduced food availability 
(Nakagawa et al., 2003).  Hu (1978) reported a 
strong relationship between vertical migration 
patterns and diet in four species of mesopelagic 
euphausiids in Oahu, Hawaii. Thysanopoda 
aequalis and T. monocantha, which are strong diel 
vertical migrators, showed a marked increase in 
stomach weight at night when exposed to a 
relatively large diel change in prey density. 
Thysanopoda pectinata, a moderate vertical 
migrator, showed constant stomach weight 
throughout day and night, while Nematobrachion 
sexspinous, a weak or non-migrator, showed 
increased stomach weight during the day, 
presumably with small change in prey density.  
The most abundant prey in the stomach of these 
euphausiids were copepods, microplankton, 
euphausiids, decapods, chaetognaths and, rarely, 
fish larvae.  Similar patterns have been observed 
for other mesopelagic and epipelagic euphausiids 
in the California Current System (Brinton, 1967). 
 
Micronektonic shrimp masticate their prey into 
pieces with mandibular teeth, which has presented 
a barrier to attempts to conduct quantitative 
studies of their feeding habits.  This feeding 
behavior is also common with squids. 
Micronektonic shrimp consume a wide variety of 
prey compared to pelagic mysids or euphausiids 
(Table 6.1).  Although they feed mainly on 
crustaceans (such as copepods), migratory shrimp 
species have also been found to consume diatoms, 
protozoans, chaetognaths, and even small fish 
(Foxton and Roe, 1974; Heffernan and Hopkins, 
1981; Nishida et al., 1988; Flock and Hopkins, 
1992; Toczko, unpubl. data).  Non-migrant 
micronektonic shrimps generally feed on 
amorphous particulate organic material derived 
from living organisms in the water column 
(Walters, 1976; Nishida et al., 1988; Flock and 
Hopkins, 1992).  As stated for myctophids, only 
the migratory species actively consume 
zooplankton in the epipelagic zone (Omori, 1969; 
Foxton and Roe, 1974; Donaldson, 1975 Walters, 
1976; Heffernan and Hopkins, 1981) and are 
thought to contribute to the dynamics of the 
oceanic ecosystems because of their high 
abundance and productivity.   
 
The diets of pelagic mysids are poorly known 
compared to other pelagic crustaceans (Table 6.1), 
but they are believed not only to feed mainly on 
crustaceans (euphausiids and copepods), but are 
also known to feed on coelenterates (Toczko et al., 
unpubl. data).

6.1.3 Cephalopod micronekton 
 
In general, cephalopods are active, fast-moving 
predators.  To support this life-history strategy, 
i.e., fast growth, short lifespan, and semelparous 
reproduction, cephalopods are voracious predators 
and feed on a wide range of prey which enables 
them to maintain both high growth and metabolic 
rates (Boucher-Rodoni and Boucaud-Camou, 
1987).  Morphologically, cephalopods possess an 
extraordinary set of adaptations to facilitate prey 
handling and enable opportunistic feeding 
(Rodhouse and Nigmatullin, 1996).      
 
6.2 Estimating the Impact of Micronekton 
Predation on Zooplankton 
 
Estimating the impact of micronekton predation on 
zooplankton is essential to understanding the 
dynamics of energy flow from mesozooplankton 
to higher trophic levels in oceanic ecosystems 
because of the huge amount of micronekton 
biomass and their intermediate size range.  As 
stated above, quantitative studies on the feeding 
habits of micronektonic squids and shrimps are 
difficult due to mastication of prey, and species-
specific feeding behaviors.  For example, some 
squid, such as Todarodes pacificus, sever the head 
of fish prey and feed only on the body.  Some 
deep-sea squid have been shown to feed only on 
fish viscera (K. Kawaguchi, pers. observ.).  
 
Among the micronekton, myctophids are believed 
to be the most important consumers of crustacean 
zooplankters, and act as competitors for prey with 
small pelagic fishes (such as sardine, anchovy, and 
saury) and the juveniles of various larger-sized 
oceanic fishes, such as tuna and salmon.  
 
6.2.1 Predation by micronektonic fish 
 
Estimates of daily rations have been compiled for 
several species, based on analyses of diel changes 
in their stomach contents (Baird et al., 1975; 
Clarke, 1978; Hopkins and Baird, 1985; 
Dalpadado and Gjøsaeter, 1988; Gorbatenko and 
Il’inskii, 1992; Pakhomov et al., 1996; Moku et 
al., 2000; Watanabe et al., 2002).  As the 
estimation methods differed between studies, 
direct comparison among species is difficult.  In 
general, however, the values obtained ranged from 
about 0.1 to 4.5% of body weight per day, in dry 
weight (Table 6.2).  All of the early studies dealt 
with the tropical and subtropical species since they 
feed mainly in the upper productive layer at night 
(which makes estimating evacuation time easier 
than for subarctic and transitional species). For the 
subarctic and transitional species (Table 2.1), 
feeding behaviors have been actively studied in 
the eastern North Pacific since the late 1960s 
(Paxton, 1967a; Collard, 1970; Borodulina, 1972; 
Tyler and Pearcy, 1975; Pearcy et al., 1979a; 
Moku et al., 2000). 
 
Some subarctic myctophid species are active 
feeders both day and night, which hinders the 
estimation of their daily ration (because of the lack 
of a diel feeding rhythm).  However, in the early 
1990s, Gorbatenko and Il’inskii (1992) estimated 
the rations of two Stenobrachius species in the 
subarctic waters of the Bering Sea (Table 6.2).  In 
the western North Pacific, prey species analyses 
were made for the SAW and TrW species in the 
1980s (Gordon et al., 1985; Kawamura and Fujii, 
1988).  Moku et al. (2000) examined the feeding 
habits and diel feeding chronology of the most 
abundant subarctic myctophids: Stenobrachius 
leucopsarus (typical Type 3 semi-migrant 
swimming up to the 20–200 m layer at night; for 
the migration pattern, see subsection 3.1.2), 
Diaphus theta (typical Type 2 midwater migrant 
swimming up to the 20–100 m layer), and 
S. nannochir (typical Type 5 non-migrant) during 
summer in the transitional waters of the western 
North Pacific.  They estimated daily rations to be 
3.3, 1.8, and 0.14% of dry body weight, 
respectively.  The value for the typical diel vertical 
migrant is the highest, followed by the semi-
migrant, and then the non-migrant, suggesting that 
the strongest feeding impact on epipelagic 
zooplankton would be from vertical migrants.  
 
Once daily rations have been obtained, the feeding 
impact of micronektonic fish on zooplankton can 
be calculated using the estimated zooplankton and 
myctophid biomass.  In this regard, it is urgent to 
develop a set of reliable sampling methods that 
allow the above estimates to be calculated.  In the 
eastern Gulf of Mexico, Hopkins and Gartner 
(1992) estimated that myctophids consume about 
2% of the mesozooplankton biomass in the upper 
200 m every night.  In the Southern Ocean,

a
dry weight basis;  
b
ash-free dry weight basis;  
c
wet weight basis 
 
myctophids are estimated to feed on 5 to 20% of 
zooplankton biomass standing stock in the upper 
300-m layer every day (Pakhomov et al., 1999).  
In the Kuroshio region, Watanabe et al. (2002) 
estimated that the four species of surface-
migratory myctophids (Fig. 6.1) consumed 0.9–
10.1% (usually 1–4%) of the zooplankton biomass 
in the upper 150 m each night during 1971–1984 
(although they likely underestimated the biomass 
of active zooplankters, like euphausiids and 
amphipods, since their data were collected with 
vertical North Pacific standard plankton 
(NORPAC) net tows). 
 
Assuming a P/B ratio of 7% per day for copepods 
in the Southern Ocean, Pakhomov et al. (1999) 
estimated that the most dominant myctophid 
species, Electrona carlsbergi, would consume 1.3 
to 16.8% of daily copepod production per day.  If 
the maximum biomass for E. carlsbergi observed 
by Filin et al. (1991) is adopted, the daily 
consumption ratios calculated would be 54 to 77% 
of the daily copepod production.  The above 
estimates in the Southern Ocean would be low 
since they were based on the assumption that 
sampling efficiency of myctophids by the trawl 
was 100%. 
 
Using the biomass of the diel migrant myctophid 
estimated by Watanabe et al. (1999) for the 
western transitional region, Moku and Hidaka 
(2002) estimated a daily feeding rate of the 
myctophids in the upper 200 m to be 32 mg C m
–2
 
day
–1
.  This feeding impact accounts for 110–
290% of the zooplankton production (or 1.9–5.1% 
of the zooplankton biomass) reported in the study 
area by Ikeda and Motoda (1978) and Odate 
(1994).  However, these values should probably be 
considered underestimates since many of the 
surface-migratory myctophids, especially those in 
the genera Symbolophorus and Tarletonbeania, 
were not effectively collected by the stern trawl 
used.  Estimates of zooplankton biomass were 
based upon vertical NORPAC net tows, and 
should also be considered an underestimate for the 
larger crustaceans, such as euphausiids and 
amphipods (due to their ability to avoid smaller 
nets) that may be important prey items. 
 
6.3 Predators  
 
Euphausiids, mesopelagic fishes, and other 
micronekton are pivotal components of marine 
ecosystems.  They play important roles due to 
their substantial biomass, widespread and 
ubiquitous occurrence, and intermediate body 
sizes between mesozooplankton and larger 
nektonic organisms.  In addition, their unique 
DVM behavior means that they also play an 
indispensable role in transporting organic material 
between the productive euphotic, and less 
productive, mesopelagic zones.  The diets of many 
important predators in the North Pacific have been 
effectively analyzed by morphology of otoliths for 
fishes (Ohizumi et al., 2001) and beaks for squids 
(Kubodera and Furuhashi, 1987).  Endo et al.

(2000) summarized the role of euphausiids, mainly

the demersal and pelagic environments.  A 
summary of the diets of major predators is 
presented by area in Table 6.3.  The following 
sections are organized by major predator 
groupings. 
 
6.3.1 Cephalopods  
Limited data are available on cephalopods in the 
PICES area. Watanabe et al. (2004) found 
substantial numbers of myctophid otoliths in the 
stomachs of the flying squid Ommastrephes 
bartramii caught in the transitional zone of the 
northwestern North Pacific (NWP) (35–39°N, 
155–175°30′E), and they were identified as 
Symbolophorus californiensis, Protomyctophum 
thompsoni, Ceratoscopelus warmingii, and 
Electrona rissoi.  The authors also found other 
micronekton, such as euphausiids and small squids 
of both subarctic and TrD origin.  Yamamura 
(unpubl. data) examined stomachs of the Japanese 
common squid Todarodes pacificus and found this 
species preyed on Euphausia pacifica, unidentified 
myctophids, and firefly squid Watasenia 
scintillans.  
 
6.3.2 Elasmobranchs   
The ingestion of euphausiids and micronekton has 
been recorded only from relatively small-sized 
shark species.  Baba et al. (1987) examined diets 
of the three species of dogfish sharks (family 
Squalidae) from central Japan waters and found 
firefly squids W. scintillans and Enoploteuthis 
chunii in all three.  Tanasichuk et al. (1991) 
identified the euphausiids T. spinifera and 
E. pacifica from the stomachs of spiny dogfish 
caught near Vancouver Island, British Columbia, 
whereas Yamamura and Kubodera (unpubl. data) 
found three common species of myctophids from 
dogfish caught in the Oyashio–Kuroshio 
Transition area.  The blue shark Prionace glauca 
also ingests euphausiids, along with myctophids, 
in the Gulf of Alaska and NWP, in spite of its 
relatively large body size (LeBrasseur, 1966; 
Kono, 1983).  In the central North Pacific, Seki 
(1993) reported that small micronektonic 
myctophids and gonatid squids dominated the diet 
of young blue sharks (<65 cm precaudal length).  
Watanabe and Kubodera (unpubl. data) identified 
beaks of Gonatus onyx and Taonius pavo, ingested 
by blue sharks in the NWP.  Rhincodon typus and 
Mobula japonica and M. thurstoni feed almost 
exclusively on swarms of the subtropical 
euphausiid N. simplex in the southern part of the 
California Current System. 
 
6.3.3 Osteichthyes  
The salmonids, especially in their adult phase in 
the open North Pacific, can be considered 
primarily as micronektonic feeders on euphausiids, 
fishes, and squids (Brodeur, 1990).  Steelhead 
trout, which migrate to the ocean from fresh water, 
depend chiefly on micronekton and euphausiids.  
Pearcy et al. (1988) identified three species of 
euphausiids, fishes, and squids from the stomachs 
of steelhead collected in the Gulf of Alaska, 
whereas Kono (1983) found two species of squids 
in steelhead from the NWP.  They pointed out that 
euphausiids were more important as prey when 
primary productivity was locally high due to 
upwelling and cyclonic circulation near the center 
of the Alaskan Gyre and Ridge Domain.  
 
Chum salmon have unique food habits among the 
Pacific salmon in that they depend more upon 
gelatinous plankton and pteropods.  Despite this, 
Pearcy et al. (1988) identified two myctophids, 
Protomyctophum thompsoni and Stenobrachius 
leucopsarus (which do not undertake diurnal 
vertical migration), suggesting that chum salmon 
feed at depths > 200 m during the day.  
 
Masou salmon, endemic to the eastern Pacific, are 
known to persist over the continental shelf during 
its oceanic migration, where they feed chiefly on 
micronekton.  Yamamura (unpubl. data) found that 
masou salmon off southeastern Hokkaido Island 
ingest euphausiids Diaphus theta and 
W. scintillans. Andrievskaya (1958) found that 
euphausiids T. longipes, T. inermis, T. spinifera, 
and E. pacifica were the most important prey item 
(~ 25%) for sockeye salmon in three out of six 
areas in the NWP, whereas no micronekton were 
found in their guts.  Euphausiids were also 
important for juvenile sockeye salmon off Oregon 
and Washington, accounting for >15% in weight 
of the total diet (Brodeur and Pearcy, 1990). 
57 
Pink salmon have diverse diets, including both 
euphausiids and micronekton.  Gorbatenko and 
Chuchukalo (1989) found that pink salmon from 
the Okhotsk Sea ingested T. longipes and 
T. spinifera, but that they constituted only 8.2% in 
wet weight (WW) of the total diet.  
 
In the coastal area of the California Current, 
Brodeur and Pearcy (1990) found that euphausiids 
(mainly E. pacifica) represented >50% WW of the 
total diet of juvenile coho salmon.  Pearcy et al. 
(1988) found that the major prey of coho salmon 
were gonatid squids in the Subarctic Current 
region, whereas euphausiids and myctophids were 
also important in the Alaskan Current and the 
Ridge Domain of the Gulf of Alaska.  Juvenile 
coho in the California Current area fed chiefly 
(>70%) on fishes, but due to the shallow coastal 
distribution, myctophids constituted only trace 
amounts (<0.1%), whereas euphausiids 
(E. pacifica and T. spinifera) accounted for about 
10% of the diet (Brodeur and Pearcy, 1990).  
Chinook salmon are piscivorous in their coastal 
phase, depending less on mesozooplankton, 
compared with other Oncorhynchus spp.  Brodeur 
and Pearcy (1990) reported that juvenile coho in 
the California Current coastal area fed mainly 
(88%) on fishes, whereas euphausiids accounted 
for <5%.  In their oceanic phase, chinook salmon 
depend mainly upon squids such as Gonatus and 
Berrytheuthis (Pearcy et al., 1988). 
 
Gadiform fishes are the most important predators 
of euphausiids and micronekton in continental 
shelf and slope areas.  Brown hakeling, Physiculus 
maximowiczi, and threadfin hakeling, Laemonema 
longipes, are dominant species over the upper 
shelf and upper slope, respectively.  Both depend 
primarily on euphausiids and micronekton in the 
Oyashio and Oyashio–Kuroshio Transition.  
Yamamura and Inada (2001) identified at least 
two, seven, and three species of micronektonic 
shrimp, fish and squids, respectively, from the 
stomachs of threadfin hakeling in the Oyashio–
Kuroshio Transition.  
 
The diet of walleye pollock has been studied 
extensively throughout the North Pacific Ocean, 
however, most studies are seasonal and cover only 
limited ontogenetic stages of the pollock life 
history.  The exceptions are the studies by Dwyer 
et al. (1987) and Mito et al. (1999) in the eastern 
Bering Sea, which were exceptionally 
comprehensive, covering entire ontogenetic stages 
and seasons.  Euphausiids were more important as 
prey during spring and summer, and for small-
sized fishes.  Mito et al. (1999) revealed a 
geographic variation in pollock diet in which 
euphausiids were more important in the 
southeastern Bering Sea than in the northeastern 
and southern Aleutian Basin.  Yoshida (1994) 
studied the diet of pelagic pollock caught 
commercially in the central Bering Sea, although 
only three species of Thysanoessa and no 
E. pacifica were found.  A recent study of walleye 
pollock diets by Yamamura et al. (2002) in the 
Oyashio is noteworthy in terms of both sample 
size and fidelity in prey identification.  They found 
that euphausiids were important prey throughout 
the year for juvenile (<200 mm SL) pollock, 
except during spring, when they fed chiefly on the 
copepod, Neocalanus cristatus.  Euphausia 
pacifica was the predominant species consumed, 
accounting for >80% of euphausiids ingested. 
Although >20 species of micronekton were 
identified, D. theta and W. scintillans were most 
important, with two Lampanyctus spp. being of 
secondary importance.  In the Japan/East Sea, 
pollock dependence on euphausiids (mainly T. 
longipes) was low during April and October 1993 
(<16%), but generally high (>70%) during April 
1994 (Kooka et al., 1997).  In the Gulf of Alaska, 
the only feeding data available are for age-0 
pollock. Brodeur (1998) found age-0 pollock 
ingested four species of Thysanoessa and 
Euphasia.  This study also examined prey 
selection and revealed that age-0 pollock showed 
an extensive preference for euphausiids.  The 
importance of micronektonic organisms as a food 
source for demersal fishes that live on the 
continental slope has been well known; Yamamura 
et al. (1993a) reported predation on the 
micronektonic squid Watasenia scintillans by 13 
species off the coast of Japan.

Diets of five rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) studied by 
Brodeur and Pearcy (1984) at the shelf break off 
Oregon showed that all depended primarily on 
euphausiids, especially E. pacifica.  The heavy 
ingestion of euphausiids was attributed to fact that 
the migration of euphausiids to daytime depths 
typically found in the open ocean was restricted by 
the shelf at their study sites, and thus euphausiids 
were trapped in close proximity to near-bottom 
predators.  Of the five species examined, 
yellowtail rockfish exhibited relatively high 
dependence (>15% by weight) on micronektonic 
fishes.  Pereyra et al. (1969) and Bosley et al. 
(2004) found that yellowtail rockfish in Astoria 
Canyon consumed mainly euphausiids and 
mesopelagic prey (S. leucopsarus and Pasiphae) 
advected into the canyon from deep water.  Yang 
and Livingston (1986, 1988) examined diets of 
two species of Atheresthes flounders and Pacific 
halibut.  All three were primarily piscivorous, but 
also ingested euphausiids to some extent.  Halibut 
also consumed S. leucopsarus and L. schmidti.  
 
Simplified food webs that include micronekton 
have been constructed by Brodeur (1988), Pearcy 
(1991) and Brodeur et al. (1999), based on reviews 
of dietary studies for both the Subarctic and 
Transition Zone of the open North Pacific 
(Fig. 6.2).  Food habits of pelagic fishes migrating 
across the Subarctic Boundary, such as Pacific 
pomfret (Brama japonica), skipjack tuna 
(Katsuwonus pelamis) and albacore tuna (Thunnus 
alalunga), were studied extensively by Kono 
(1983).  He found that euphausiids and gonatid 
squids were important prey, along with pelagic 
forage fishes, such as Pacific sardine and anchovy. 
Myctophids, however, were far less important in 
their diets.  The diets of Pacific pomfret in the 
Gulf of Alaska consisted of many micronektonic 
squid (mostly Gonatidae), euphausiids, and some 
myctophids such as Tarletonbeania crenularis 
(Pearcy et al., 1993). 
 
6.3.4 Seabirds   
This topic has been reviewed extensively for the 
subarctic Pacific region by PICES Working Group 
11 on Consumption of Marine Resources by 
Marine Birds and Mammals (Hunt et al., 2000) 
and will, therefore, be only briefly considered in 
 
this review.  In Hawaiian waters, Harrison et al. 
(1983) examined the diets of Bonin and Bluwer’s 
petrels and found that both species depend 
primarily on fish, including sternoptychids and 
myctophids.  Although shearwaters are one of the 
most abundant oceanic birds, information on their 
food habits is very limited.  Shiomi and Ogi 
(1992) examined diets of sooty shearwaters in the 
North Pacific and reported that they are primarily 
piscivorous and rarely ingest euphausiids (<1% 
WW).  Off northern California, midwater squids 
(Gonatus sp. and Onychoteuthis boreali-
japonicus) were important prey for sooty 
shearwaters, along with anchovy and rockfishes, 
(Chu, 1984).  Ogi (1980a) examined stomachs of 
short-tailed shearwaters in the Okhotsk and Bering 
Seas, and the North Pacific, and found that 
euphausiids, (especially T. raschii) were important 
only in the eastern Bering Sea.  Storm petrels and 
auklets are primarily planktivorous, reflecting their 
relatively small body size.  Hunt et al. (1998) 
compared least, crested, and parakeet auklets 
along with the biophysical sampling near the 
Aleutian Islands, and found a well-partitioned 
foraging pattern in which only the crested auklet 
foraged upon euphausiids upwelled on the 
upstream side of a pass.  Murrelets show mixed 
diets of mesozooplankton and fishes, but no 
midwater fishes and squids were reported as prey.  
In California during the pre-breeding season, and 
after the onset of upwelling, euphausiids 
(E. pacifica and T. spinifera) and juvenile rockfish 
(Sebastes spp.) became prevalent in the diet of 
murres.  Diets were least diverse during the 
breeding season because of the dominance of 
rockfish, especially among murres foraging in 
mid- and outer-shelf habitats.  Other important 
prey were also significant for commercial or sport 
fishing: Engraulis mordax and Clupea harengus in 
coastal waters, Merluccius productus and Loligo 
opalescens in mid- and outer-shelf waters.  These 
results support a hypothesis that diet varies as a 
function of where murres forage.  Hence, if the 
most characteristic prey of one habitat disappears, 
murres switch foraging areas, bringing a switch in 
diet.  Owing to environmental changes in the 
region, murres may be losing the option of prey 
switching as a strategy to maintain an adequate 
intake of food (Ainley et al., 1996b).

Fig. 6.2 Structure of North Pacific Ocean food webs.  (from Brodeur et al., 1999)
65 
The diet of a planktivore, the Cassin’s auklet 
Ptychoramphus aleuticus, in the Gulf of the 
Farallones, California, is strongly associated with 
the local climate and food availability.  During the 
non-upwelling period, auklets fed on the small, 
energetically inferior, oceanic euphausiid 
E. pacifica, but following the spring transition, the 
auklets switched to small, juvenile fish (mostly 
Sebastes spp.) until these had grown too large for 
capture (Ainley et al., 1996a).  Thereafter, the 
auklets switched to the larger and energetically 
more valuable euphausiid, T. spinifera, which had 
become available upon the onset of upwelling. 
This general pattern was repeated each year, 
although some between-year variability among 
ancillary prey was evident.  The decrease in the 
prevalence of T. spinifera in the diet fed to chicks 
from 1971 to 1991 is consistent with decreased 
intensity of upwelling in the region, as is the 
reduction in numbers of auklets in the region over 
the same period (Ainley et al., 1996a). 
 
6.3.5 Pinnipeds  
Among the pinnipeds, the diets of northern fur 
seals have been studied most extensively.  Perez 
and Bigg (1986) organized a data set on a 
substantial number (n = 18,404) of fur seal 
stomachs and revealed that they are primarily 
piscivorous and feed opportunistically.  In their 
data set, myctophids occurred only in the northern 
California Current, and gonatiid squids were 
relatively important (30%) in the eastern Bering 
Sea.  Northern fur seals in the Oyashio–Kuroshio 
Transition fed primarily on Notoscopelus 
japonicus, Diaphus spp. (probably D. theta and 
D. kuroshio) (Wada, 1971) and W. scintillans, 
along with threadfin hakeling, schooling pelagic 
fishes, and Japanese common squid.  
 
Among the Pacific phocid seals, ringed seals 
depend on relatively small-sized animals including 
amphipods, euphausiids, and fishes (King, 1983). 
Lowry et al. (1980) found that euphausiids 
account for <3% of the diet, whereas saffron cod 
and shrimp were more important.  Other seals feed 
primarily on fish on an opportunistic basis. Goto 
(1999) examined the stomach contents of spotted 
and ribbon seals along the Okhotsk Sea coast of 
Hokkaido Island and found T. inermis and 
Lampanyctus jordani, respectively.  Elephant seals 
and Steller sea lions also prey mainly on relatively 
large-sized fish and cephalopods, so the ingestion 
of micronekton is very limited. 
 
6.3.6 Cetaceans 
 
Baleen whales 
 
Only studies from the period of pelagic whaling 
have been available for reconstructing the diets of 
baleen whales.  In the North Pacific a few species, 
including the blue whale Balaenoptera musculus 
depend primarily on euphausiids (Kawamura, 
1982; Smith and Adams, 1988; Croll et al., 1998). 
Other species such as fin, humpback, sei, and 
minke whales are basically piscivorous, and prey 
opportunistically upon abundant fish and squid 
(T. Tamura, pers. comm.).  The available literature 
deals mostly with euphausiids ingested by whales, 
and includes E. pacifica and four species of 
Thysanoessa that were commonly consumed in the 
Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, Okhotsk Sea, and 
Oyashio Current area.  Kawamura (1973, 1982) 
reported diets of sei and Bryde’s whales, and 
identified Maurolicus muelleri, Vinciguerria 
nimbaria, and Tarletonbeania taylori as prey 
items.  Recently, Tamura and Fujise (unpubl. data) 
studied minke whale diets in the North Pacific 
Ocean and found that the bulk (81%) of the diet 
was composed of saury Cololabis saira.  Although 
E. pacifica, T. inermis, T. inspinata, and 
T. longipes were also identified, their total 
contribution was only around 5% of the diet. 
 
Acevedo-Gutiérrez et al. (2002) concluded that the 
blue whale forages in relatively small areas 
(<1 km
2
) and foraging lasts for more than one 
dive, indicating that euphausiids do not disperse.  
The high energetic cost of lunge-feeding confine 
them to short durations of submergence, and to 
areas with dense euphausiid aggregations, like the 
hot spots in frontal zones described by Etnoyer et 
al. (2004).  Thus, because of their limited foraging 
time under water, these whales may be particularly 
vulnerable to perturbations in prey abundance. 
 
According to Croll et al. (1998), the diving 
behavior of foraging blue whales is correlated to 
the distribution and density of euphausiid 
aggregations. These whales showed a stereotypical 
pattern, diving consistently and directly down to 
66 
150–200 m in the water column and performing a 
series of 1–4 min, 20–30 m vertical excursions on 
each dive, feeding exclusively upon euphausiids in 
proportions significantly different from the 
composition of euphausiids in net samples.  Thus, 
blue whales concentrate their foraging activity on 
deeper layers of euphausiids during the day. 
Analysis of whale fecal samples revealed that blue 
whales in Monterey Bay, California, fed primarily 
upon T. spinifera (80% ± 22.6%) and E. pacifica 
(13% ± 26.4%); other euphausiids accounted for 
only 7% (±4.7%) of their diet.  Euphausiid species 
composition within net samples collected during 
the same period consisted of 30.17% (±34.95%) 
T. spinifera, 68.32% (±34.75%) E. pacifica, and 
1.51% (±2.56%) other species.  They reported for 
the first time, an estimate of the magnitude of prey 
densities for large rorquals feeding on euphausiid 
patches having densities up to 4,400 individuals 
m
–3
 on the shelf-break of Monterey Canyon  (Croll 
et al., 1998).  Thus, blue whales appear to be 
seeking out extremely dense aggregations of 
zooplankton to meet their metabolic needs 
(minimum required approximately 50 individuals 
m
–3
).  The annual migratory movements of 
California blue whales likely reflect seasonal 
patterns in productivity in other foraging areas 
(Etnoyer et al., 2004).  The authors recognized 
particularly the relevance of persistent thermal 
oceanic fronts in the North Pacific in the blue 
whale distribution and residence time; specifically, 
they showed how blue whales migrate from 
central California waters to the oceanic thermal 
front southwest of the Baja California peninsula 
(~23°N), considered a critical hot spot habitat for 
this species.  This frontal zone, with persistence of 
more than 9 months, is considered a hot spot for 
the entire Northeast Pacific (Malakoff, 2004), but 
Etnoyer et al. (2004) reported such thermal fronts 
are rare, located in only 1% of the total area of the 
North Pacific Ocean.  Regions with different 
seasonal upwelling patterns, and euphausiid 
species with different life history traits, will show 
temporal differences in peak euphausiid 
abundance.  Due to their high total prey 
requirements, California blue whales likely 
migrate seasonally between dense, ephemeral 
euphausiid patches that appear in southern/central 
California waters in the summer and fall, the Gulf 
of California in the winter, and the central Baja 
California Pacific coast in the spring. 
Toothed whales 
 
Diets of toothed cetaceans are characterized by a 
diverse spectrum of prey items, with a typical 
individual containing >5 prey categories in its 
stomach. Recently, Japanese scientists have 
conducted extensive studies of the food habits of 
toothed whales, revealing the diversity and 
significance of micronektonic animals in diets.  
For instance, Ohizumi (1998) and Ohizumi et al. 
(2003) examined the stomach contents of Dall’s 
porpoise from many areas of the North Pacific 
Ocean and presented geographical variation in 
species composition of micronektonic fishes.  In 
the Oyashio Current, N. japonicus, D. theta, 
L. jordani, and P. thompsoni were predominant. 
Although D. theta was important throughout the 
North Pacific Ocean, other predominant species 
changed by subarea.  Finally, the importance of 
D. theta was replaced by S. leucopsarus in the 
Bering Sea.  They also identified >15 species of 
cephalopods from the stomach contents.  Robison 
and Craddock (1983) found that Fraser’s dolphins 
feed on micronektonic mesopelagic fishes.  Sperm 
whales have been known for their preference for 
squids, and more than 20 species of midwater 
squids have been identified from the stomachs of 
sperm whales.  Interestingly, no euphausiids have 
been found in the stomachs of toothed whales to 
date. 
 
6.3.7 Human consumption 
Some fisheries on myctophids have been carried 
out in the past and some restricted local 
consumption of myctophid fishes have also been 
reported (Gjøsaeter and Kawaguchi, 1980). 
Although the qualities of lipids and protein of 
myctophid fishes have been shown not to differ 
much from those of commercial fishes, the non-
migratory species have wax and are therefore, not 
suitable for human consumption (Seo et al., 1996, 
1998; Saito and Murata, 1996).  Euphausiids, 
mostly Euphausia pacifica, are currently 
consumed by people in Russia and Japan.  Japan 
alone had an average annual catch of around 
60,000 t between 1986 and 2000; about 6–7% was 
used for human consumption and for bait in sport 
fishing (Ichii, 2000).  The euphausiid fishery is 
also developed in Canada and United States for 
aquaculture and the aquarium pet food industry 
67 
(human consumption, negligible), with catches 
ranging from 40 to 580 t between 1983 and 1995. 
 
6.4 Predation Rate 
 
Only a few attempts have been made to estimate 
the consumption of euphausiids and micronekton 
by any particular group of fishes.  Brodeur et al. 
(1992) estimated food consumption of juvenile 
coho and chinook salmon in the California Current 
area during the summers of 1981 to 1984, using 
both field data and bioenergetic modeling 
methods.  Since juveniles of both species fed 
primarily on fishes, the estimated daily 
consumption of euphausiids was only about 
0.13 kg km
–2
.  By calculating fractions of prey 
consumed daily by predators, they concluded that 
“food limitation” is unlikely for salmon during 
normal years.  Of the 87 species examined for 
stomach contents, Yamamura et al. (1998) found 
that 24 species, representing >90% of the fish 
biomass, were highly dependent on E. pacifica, 
and the maximum consumption rate by the entire 
fish assemblage was estimated to be 7.52 kg km
–2
 
d
–1
. Although no estimates of euphausiid 
abundance were available, they noted that the 
annual estimate of consumption by the demersal 
fish community represented 15–64% of the 
commercial catch of E. pacifica, and concluded 
that euphausiid fisheries would have a 
considerable impact on demersal fish assemblages. 
 
Robinson (2000) estimated euphausiid 
consumption by the seven most abundant fish 
species on the continental shelf off southwestern 
Vancouver Island for the month of August, from 
1985 to 1997.  The fish community during August 
was estimated to consume an average of 124 t 
km
–2
, and Pacific hake and herring accounted for 
60% and 30%, respectively, of the euphausiid 
consumption.  
 
Yamamura and Inada (2001) evaluated the 
contribution of micronekton to the total diet of 
demersal fish assemblages in Oyashio–Kuroshio 
Transition.  From 1989 to 1992, the average 
contribution of micronekton during May and 
November was estimated to be 35.7% and 35.5%, 
respectively.  Although no consumption estimate 
was available directly from Yamamura and Inada 
(2001), the demersal fish assemblage in the deep 
layer (300–500 m) was estimated to consume 
22.8 kg km
–2 
daily during May 1991, applying the 
parameters used in Yamamura et al. (1998).  
 
Recently, Yamamura (2004) estimated the prey 
consumption rates of walleye pollock in the 
coastal Oyashio Current area using an age-
structured trophodynamic model. The average 
annual consumption of euphausiids (mainly 
E. pacifica), fish micronekton, and small squid 
(mainly W. scintillans) by adult walleye pollock 
was estimated to be 22.2 ± 5.3 g m
–2
 yr
–1
, 6.3 ± 1.6 
g m
–2
 yr
–1
 and 3.0 ± 0.6 g m
–2 
yr
–1
, respectively. 
Remarkably, all of these consumption estimates 
outstripped standing stock and annual production.  
He concluded that these prey are supplemented by 
active migration and passive transport from more 
oceanic areas. 
 
Although no attempt has been made to estimate 
euphausiid/micronekton consumption by specific 
seabirds or marine mammals, total prey 
consumption during summer has been estimated 
for some regions of North Pacific (Hunt et al., 
2000).  Zooplankton consumption rates by 
seabirds during the summer (92 days) in the 
eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska were high 
(55 and 44 t km
–2
, respectively).  Of these, more 
than half would be represented by euphausiids. 
Consumption estimates for marine mammals are 
shown in Table 6.4.  It should be noted that 13.7 t 
of micronekton were consumed daily in the 
Kamchatka and Kuril Islands area.  The greatest 
portion of the consumption was attributed to 
Dall’s porpoise, northern right whales, and Pacific 
white-sided dolphins.  Other areas of heavy 
summer consumption of micronekton (exceeding 
20 t km
–2
) included the western transition region, 
the Okhotsk Sea, and the Kuroshio/Oyashio 
Current regions.  Based on substantial sampling 
throughout the North Pacific and the Bering Sea, 
Ohizumi et al. (2003) estimated that Dall’s 
porpoises, alone, would consume approximately 
4.7% to 6.5% of the biomass of mesopelagic fishes 
in the subarctic Pacific Ocean, and may account 
for almost a third of the mortality of micronekton 
in the region.  They suggested that myctophids are 
a major energy pathway leading to Dall’s 
porpoises in the subarctic Pacific.

6.5 Ecosystem Perspectives 
 
The food webs leading to and from micronekton in 
the open North Pacific regions, including the 
subarctic, transition, and subtropical regions, have 
been summarized by Brodeur et al. (1999) and 
Seki and Polovina (2001) (see Figure 6.2).  The 
aforementioned studies have revealed (usually 
qualitatively rather than quantitatively) that prey–
predator relationships between micronekton and 
mesozooplankton, especially crustaceans, are one 
of the key processes in oceanic food webs.  To 
further understand this process, the feeding 
behaviors of micronekton (including feeding 
chronology, prey selectivity, and daily ration) 
should be studied not only in fish but also in 
squids, euphausiids, and shrimps.  In particular, 
the feeding ecology of micronektonic squid should 
be stressed in order to understand rate processes of 
the oceanic marine food web, since squid are 
known to grow substantially faster than fish (due 
to their shorter life cycles and higher secondary 
productivity rates).   
 
In the transition and subarctic waters, the 
mesozooplankton community is dominated by 
copepods of the genera Neocalanus and 
Eucalanus, both of which undergo extended 
ontogenetic vertical migrations (Miller et al., 
1984; Miller and Clemons, 1988; Tsuda et al., 
1999; Kobari and Ikeda, 1999).  Due to their 
seasonal vertical migration, during which most of 
the year is spent overwintering at depth, the 
vertical structure of the prey environment 
experienced by micronektonic animals would 
change spatio-temporally, probably also causing 
changes in micronekton feeding behaviors. 
However, knowledge on the seasonality of 
micronekton feeding is extremely limited for all 
taxonomic groups.  Interestingly, the extent to 
which diel migratory micronekton in the subarctic 
Pacific utilize (or rely on) overwintering layers of 
these large calanoids (e.g., Neocalanus spp.) as a 
food source is also unknown.  The depth range 
occupied by these overwintering layers 
(approximately 400–1200 m) overlaps the vertical 
distribution of both migrant and non-migrant 
myctophids species.  This topic certainly warrants 
future study, as these deep overwintering layers 
occur throughout the subarctic Pacific and 
represent a large portion of the annual secondary 
production in the region.   
 
6.6 Interactions between Micronekton and 
Shallow Topographies 
 
Micronekton often show concentrations well 
above the background levels in several types of 
pelagic hot spot environments that are associated 
with abrupt topographies (Dower and Brodeur, 
2004; Genin, 2004).  Boehlert and Mundy (1993) 
reported that the ichthyofauna of seamounts and 
oceanic islands are typically dominated by 
myctophid larvae.  Despite this, only a very few 
species of micronekton (e.g., Maurolicus muelleri) 
are known to spawn over shallow topographies.  
The apparent enrichment of myctophid (and other) 
larvae over such topographies likely occurs via 
physical concentration in Taylor cones, through 
bottom-trapping during DVM behavior (e.g., 
Genin et al., 1994; Genin, 2004; Wilson and 
Boehlert, 2004), or via other topographically 
generated flows (see Roden, 1987; Rodgers, 
1994). 
 
There is evidence that micronektonic species 
occasionally form a mesopelagic boundary 
69 
community that interacts with the slope regions of 
shallow topographies (e.g., seamounts, oceanic 
islands, and continental slopes) and are often 
called a “slope water community” or “shelf-edge 
community”.  Reid et al. (1991) documented one 
such mesopelagic boundary community around 
Hawaii in which six micronektonic fish species 
(which together comprised 90% of the 
micronekton community) occurred at depths of 
400–700 m on the island slope.  These same 
species, however, were virtually absent at the 
same depths even a few kilometers offshore.  The 
species in question were also reported to undergo 
diel horizontal migrations upslope to depths as 
shallow as 50–250 m.  These communities may be 
represented by patches with a horizontal extent of 
several kilometers (Benoit-Bird and Au, 2003).  
Reid et al. (1991) state that similar mesopelagic 
boundary communities have been reported 
occasionally from continental slopes and may, in 
fact, be a global phenomenon.  Similar 
mesopelagic boundary communities (slope water 
communities) have been commonly observed from 
continental or insular slopes in tropical and 
subtropical waters of the Indo-West Pacific region 
(Kawaguchi, 1976; Reid et al., 1991). 
 
There is also reason to suspect that seamounts and 
oceanic islands may represent local hot spots for 
the feeding and growth of non-boundary 
community micronekton, particularly in 
oligotrophic regions.  Rissik and Suthers (2000) 
and Suthers (1996) reported that, relative to 
background conditions, post-larvae and late 
juveniles of Diaphus kapalae and various 
Myctophum spp. exhibited significantly higher 
levels of gut fullness, recent growth rates (based 
on otolith microstructure), and better condition 
(based on RNA:DNA ratios) in the flow-disturbed 
region downstream of an island in the South 
Pacific.  Such behavior may also be expected to 
occur in the oligotrophic North Pacific, which is 
replete with shallow seamounts. 
 
Submarine canyons are another environment 
where micronekton may be aggregated due to 
convergent flows on steep topography (Genin, 
2004).  Canyons along the west coast of North 
America show enhanced concentrations of 
micronekton, especially euphausiids, relative to 
other shelf or slope environments, and frequently 
contain elevated biomass of higher trophic level 
predators feeding on these abundant and 
predictable food sources (Pereyra et al., 1969; 
Schoenherr, 1991; Mackas et al., 1997; Brodeur, 
2001b).  Based on an analysis of currents and 
stable isotope composition of plankton and fish, 
Bosley et al. (2004) determined that rockfishes in 
Astoria Canyon off the Columbia River, Oregon 
were feeding on primarily mesopelagic prey of 
offshore origin, which was confirmed by diet 
analysis.

7. Sampling Considerations 
7.1 Net Trawling  
 
The merits and shortcomings of many different 
gear types for sampling micronekton have been 
discussed at length in reports and publications 
arising from the SCOR Working Group on 
Methods of Sampling Micronekton (Pearcy, 1975; 
1981).  We will briefly review some of the major 
findings of that Working Group and discuss new 
developments in the intervening period.  Wiebe 
and Benfield (2003) have recently traced the 
history, and summarized the state of the art, with 
respect to sampling both zooplankton and 
micronekton, and discuss at length some 
alternatives to net sampling, including optical and 
acoustic methodologies.  Net gear can be classified 
into either non-closing nets or opening/closing 
nets of various sizes and designs.  Watkins et al. 
(2000) summarized the most usual sampling 
methods used to collect euphausiids, and Nicol 
(2003) reported the need to develop new methods 
for those organisms, such as euphausiids that are 
in between macrozooplankton and micronekton. 
 
7.1.1 Sampling gears  
 
Biomass estimates of micronektonic or 
mesopelagic fishes have been attempted with 
various sampling gears, such as an ORI-net (a 
large conical plankton net of 2 m
2
 mouth opening), 
6 ft-IKMT (Isaacs-Kidd midwater trawl, 3.5 m
2
 
mouth opening), 10 ft-IKMT (~10 m
2
), large 
Tucker Trawl (4 m
2
), Methot Trawl (5 m
2
), 
RMT-8 (8 m
2
), Cobb Trawl (~100 m
2
), and, more 
recently, commercial-sized midwater trawls with 
mouth openings of 400–3500 m
2
 (Table 4.1).  The 
depth coverage of the sampling varies greatly in 
the literature, so in most cases biomass is 
expressed as weight per unit sea surface area in the 
0–1000 m layer at night or the 200–1000 m layer 
(mesopelagic zone) during the daytime. 
 
Although estimates made with micronekton nets, 
such as the ORI-net, 6 ft-IKMT, 10 ft-IKMT and 
RMT-8 tend to increase with the mouth area, the 
differences between them are within a factor of 2 
to 3.  As shown in Table 4.1, however, biomass 
estimates from commercial trawls are significantly 
larger (usually an order of magnitude larger) than 
those from so-called “micronekton nets” with 
mouth areas less than 10 m
2
.  It has been shown 
that larger myctophids, ranging from 10 to 20 cm 
SL (such as Lampadena, Lampanyctus and 
Nannobrachium), are very common in commercial 
trawl catches.  These large “nektonic myctophids” 
are rarely collected by normal micronekton nets 
and, even when they are collected, they are not 
usually categorized as micronekton, but rather as 
an accidental catch since they tend to bias the 
biomass estimate of typical “micronektonic 
fishes”.  
 
The filtering volume of a large commercial trawl 
is several hundred times larger than that of a 
micronekton net due to both its large mouth and 
higher towing speed, 2–2.5 m s
–1
 (4–5 knots).  
This high catchability of large trawl nets has 
revealed the presence of large micronektonic 
animals, including fishes and squids, which span 
the gap both in size and swimming ability between 
“micronekton” and “nekton”, as conventionally 
recognized.  Thus, sampling targets are different 
between these two types of sampling gears, with 
one covering typical micronektonic animals less 
than 10 cm in total body length while the other 
targets micronekton in the 10–20 cm range.  
 
It should also be noted that micronektonic fish 
biomass is different from mesopelagic fish 
biomass.  In most Russian literature based on 
commercial-sized trawls, biomasses were 
estimated for mesopelagic fishes, including the 
above-mentioned larger-sized micronekton, 
including large myctophids, bathylagids, stomiids, 
and paralepidids (Beamish et al., 1999).  The 
difference in estimates between the above 
mentioned two different sized types of gears 
would be larger in the subarctic and transition 
regions than in the tropical and subtropical waters, 
since larger-sized mesopelagic fishes are more 
common in cold waters (e.g., the mean size of 
mesopelagic animals is smaller and the range is 
narrower in warmer waters than in cold waters). 
 
 
72 
7.1.2 Sampling of surface migratory 
myctophids   
 
It is known that surface migrant myctophids 
(Table 3.1) are not collected effectively with 
sampling gears deployed from the stern of the 
vessel due to the disturbance from the ship’s wake. 
To avoid the ship’s wake, neuston net sampling 
should be conducted from the side of the ship, but 
the effects of the bow wave, and bridles and 
towing wire from the side beam, are also potential 
problems.  Effects of bridles and towing wire on 
net avoidance of surface migrant myctophids were 
studied, based on the comparison between the 
catches of a conical plankton net and bridle-free 
neuston net.  These studies revealed that 
Myctophum asperum, a typical surface migrant (of 
28–29.9 mm size range) in the Kuroshio Current, 
avoided a bridle-towed net (mouth size, 2 m
2
) 
around 20 times more effectively compared with 
the bridle-free neuston net of much smaller mouth 
size (0.24 m
2
) (Watanabe, 1998; Watanabe and 
Kawagwuchi, 1999).  They also showed that M. 
asperum > 30 mm SL were rarely collected by the 
bridle-towed net, but larger specimens up to 
42 mm SL were collected by the bridle-free 
neuston net.  The neuston net is designed to be 
towed from its side otter board, so no bridle, 
towing wire, or ropes are present in front of the net 
mouth, and thus, it is capable of sampling outside 
of the ship’s wake.  However, its handling in 
rough seas is compromised due to the instability of 
the otter board, which responds to the rough sea 
surface.  At present, there are no suitable sampling 
gears to estimate densities of surface migrant 
myctophids, in spite of their considerable biomass, 
and their importance as prey in the oceanic surface 
ecosystem at night.  Towing commercial-sized 
trawls in their daytime habitat would be promising 
but visual avoidance of the net is likely, since their 
daytime habitat is in the upper mesopelagic zone. 
 
7.1.3 Commercial-sized trawl sampling  
The merits of commercial-sized trawls are their 
high catch rate and high towing speed, although 
small mesh cannot be adopted for an entire trawl 
net because of its high resistance.  The use of fine 
mesh cod-end (5–12 mm mesh) makes commercial 
trawls effective for determining qualitative 
characters or relative abundance of micronekton, 
in spite of the disadvantage owing to escape 
through the larger mesh near the net mouth.  The 
visual threat by the large mesh would be effective 
for good swimmers to prevent extrusion through 
the mesh.  Recent studies based on large trawls 
revealed a large amount of “nektonic 
micronekton” biomass in the mesopelagic zone 
(Beamish et al., 1999; Watanabe et al., 1999).  It 
should be noted that commercial-sized midwater 
trawl catches have shown a remarkably different 
picture from that of the traditionally adopted 
micronekton nets, like IKMT and RMT, in terms 
of size spectrum and species composition.  
Although the previous studies adopted 10–15% as 
a catch rate, based on empirical knowledge, 
critical studies of their sampling efficiency are 
limited, but will be required in order to know the 
absolute standing stock of micronekton.  
 
7.1.4 Sampling of euphausiids and pelagic 
decapods  
 
Brinton (1967) demonstrated that adult 
euphausiids exhibit active net avoidance, 
particularly to nets with bridles, and during 
daytime sampling.  Euphausia pacifica seems to 
have different regional DVM patterns that may 
affect its catchability.  In Japan, surface daytime 
aggregations facilitate the catch of relatively high 
densities, whereas in the eastern Pacific, those 
daytime surface aggregations seem to be less 
frequent (Nicol and Endo, 1997).  Nets with large 
mouth areas and black mesh nets, like the 
BIONESS or the MOCNESS, substantially 
increase the efficiency of catches in regions with 
moderate and high densities of euphausiids. 
However, in tropical and suptropical 
environments, and perhaps in the oligotrophic 
Central Pacific, where euphausiids typically have 
lower densities than in high productive coastal 
environments, daytime net avoidance may be 
increased, leading to underestimates of the 
populational abundance.  Wilson et al. (2003) used 
light traps to attract and collect the neritic 
euphausiid Pseudeuphasia latifrons in Western 
Australia, collecting densities several orders of 
magnitude larger than with conventional nets.  
Wiebe et al. (2004) have recently suggested that 
the escape avoidance of euphausiids can be partly 
overcome by equipping MOCNESS systems with 
large strobe lights. Working in the Southern 
73 
Ocean, they found that strobing increased the total 
euphausiid biomass captured by a factor of about 
1.5.  Moreover, the increased biomass resulted 
mainly from having captured about twice as many 
adult euphausiids (15–60 mm length) as compared 
to a MOCNESS without strobing.  Differences in 
abundance of euphausiids also are common when 
net samples are compared with abundance 
estimated from acoustic data.  Omori (1983) 
compared various methods (small and large net 
trawling, underwater photography, larval 
abundance, and predator consumption) to estimate 
the abundance of micronekton sergestid shrimp.  
Gómez-Gutiérrez and Robinson (2005) used a 1-m 
ring with black mesh net with a codend 70 cm 
long and 25 cm wide, equipped with a commercial 
underwater video camera (Ikelite), a commercial 
diver underwater light, and a microcat Seabird 
CTD to collect epibenthic swarms of the 
subtropical euphausiid Nyctiphanes simplex in the 
southern part of Baja California.  The catch 
efficiency was high enough to collect up to 80 kg 
of N. simplex adults in a 15-minute trawl.  The 
simultaneous in situ observations of swarming 
behavior and sampling of the specimens is a 
promising method to study euphausiids in the 
field.  Sampling method is critical to estimate 
euphausiid abundance.  Nicol (1986) compared 
densities of the North Atlantic euphausiid 
Meganyctiphanes norvegica surface swarms using 
three different methods: bag-sampler estimating 
densities up to 41,000 euphausiids m
–3
; 
photographic methods estimating densities up to 
770,000 euphausiids m
–3
, and plankton net which 
gave numbers that never exceeded 6 euphausiids 
m
–3
.  The same is true for significant differences in 
the abundance, including comparisons of several 
orders of magnitude, when euphausiid abundance 
is estimated acoustically and by standard 
zooplankton nets (Watkins et al., 2000).  This is 
particularly interesting because E. pacifica, 
Thysanoessa spinifera, P. latifrons and N. simplex 
in the North Pacific commonly form daytime 
surface swarms that usually are out of acoustic 
detection (by the near-field effect) and net 
avoidance makes it particularly difficult to 
estimate reliable in situ standing stock. 
7.2 Acoustic Sampling 
 
7.2.1 Acoustic theory and usage  
The local intensities of trophic interactions within 
the micronekton community, and of trophic 
interactions between the micronekton and either 
fish or plankton, are, in general, proportional to 
the products of their local concentrations.  These 
concentrations are very patchy, varying by several 
orders of magnitude.  The development and 
application of remote sensing for examination of 
biological and physical variables at a variety of 
scales is critical to the identification and 
quantification of specific biological oceanographic 
processes influencing populations and species 
composition in marine ecosystems.  Quantitative 
acoustics is one such remote sensing technology.  
Although applied mainly for the purposes of 
fisheries management and stock assessment, its 
ability to estimate the biomass of planktonic, 
micronektonic and nektonic organisms at fine 
scales makes it an important research tool in 
modern biological oceanography.  The basic 
principles of sound scattering by zooplankton and 
nekton have been described (Holliday, 1980; 
Greene and Wiebe, 1990; Smith et al., 1992; 
MacLennan and Simmonds, 1992; Watkins et al., 
2000; Foote and Stanton, 2000).  Much of the 
information presented here can be found in the 
above references. The application of acoustic 
techniques to biological oceanography involves 
three primary tasks:  
 
1.  Collection and standardization of the acoustic 
measurements (obtaining an accurate 
measurement of acoustic backscatter from a 
volume of water or an individual target),  
2. Target identification (knowing what type of 
target(s) produced the backscatter), and  
3. Based on the above knowledge, scaling of the 
acoustic measurements to abundance or 
biomass of the target population(s) present in 
each acoustically-sampled volume. 
 
74 
The first step (acoustic calibration) is essentially 
an engineering problem of quantifying the 
electrical response of a particular system 
(oscillator, transducer, receiver, and data logger) 
for a known acoustic target strength at a known 
range. Although commercial echo sounder 
suppliers can carry out thorough calibrations of 
system components before delivery, regular 
follow-up field calibrations with a standard target 
are recommended, and are essential if components 
are interchanged.  Soule et al. (1995) showed that 
evidence of bias in estimates of target strength 
obtained with a split-beam echo sounder were due 
to problems in the software algorithms detected 
during tank-tested calibration experiments.  Once 
the data have been collected, the detailed 
information they provide on the spatial distribution 
of sound scattering intensity must be converted to 
some measure of abundance or biomass to be of 
use in biological research.  This is done in the 
second and third steps (target identification and 
calculation of biomass estimates from acoustic 
backscatter intensity).  The two are inter-related. 
Different biological targets have different target-
strength characteristics that are functions of their 
body type (density and compressibility contrast 
relative to the surrounding seawater, presence or 
absence of “hard” parts, presence or absence of 
gas bubbles), their size, their orientation (if body 
shape is not isotropic), the acoustic frequencies 
used, and the position of the target relative to the 
axis of the acoustic beam, and the abundance and 
neighbor-to-neighbor distance of the organisms 
that sometimes make it difficult to discriminate 
single targets. The problems of target 
identification and conversion from target strength 
to animal abundance or biomass density also 
differ, depending on whether one or multiple 
targets are present in the resolved range interval 
along the acoustic beam.  
 
In general, a wide range of target types is present 
in a given survey domain.  The conversion factors 
are, therefore, highly sensitive to misinterpretation 
if the size, shape, orientation, and composition of 
the targets is unknown or incorrect (Stanton et al., 
1996).  Using a dual-beam acoustical system, 
Wiebe et al. (1990) measured the target strengths 
of a variety of zooplankton and micronekton 
ranging in size from large copepods to shrimp, and 
found target strengths ranging from –93 to –43 db 
animal
–1
, a range equivalent to five orders of 
magnitude.  Such a broad range of possible sound 
scattering intensity by potential targets necessarily 
implies the potential for large errors in the 
conversion of acoustic data to estimates of 
abundance and biomass.  Therefore, much effort 
has been devoted to the development of techniques 
to accurately scale acoustic data to the abundance 
or biomass of the target species.  For example, the 
development of multiple-beam technology has 
improved substantially the measurement of 
individual target strengths of the organisms.  Dual- 
beam and split-beam systems can determine the 
target strength of the sound scattering organisms 
by measuring the position of the target in the 
sound cone relative to the acoustic axis.  If the 
position of the target is known, then the beam 
pattern can be used to normalize the return for 
each target relative to the reflected intensity at the 
acoustic axis. If a sufficient number of 
measurements are made on targets over a broad 
size category, an empirical model of target 
strength against target size can be generated using 
regression analysis (e.g., Foote and Traynor, 1988; 
Traynor, 1996).  The results of the empirical 
model may then provide backscatter values for 
each size category in the study area.  However, a 
limitation of this approach is that each target must 
be resolved individually, which requires very fine 
spatial resolution of the ensonified volumes in 
some cases.   
 
An alternative approach is to measure the total 
return from all targets within the resolved 
sampling volume, and solve for a biomass versus 
target spectrum, assuming a matrix of average 
target strength for each target type at each acoustic 
frequency.  The fundamental assumption 
governing quantitative acoustics is that the total 
scattering intensity from a given volume of water 
is equal to the sum of the scattering by each 
individual randomly-distributed target within the 
volume.  However, the target strength of an 
individual target is a function of its physical aspect 
relative to the direction of the incident sound 
wave, density, and reflection characteristics of the 
organisms.  When converting relative signal 
intensity to absolute abundance or biomass, it is 
assumed that the animals are randomly distributed 
within the insonified volume, and that a sufficient 
number of measurements will produce an unbiased 
75 
mean value of volume backscatter.  In this case, 
the acoustic return is measured as backscatter 
intensity per unit volume of water, rather than per 
unit target, and the calculation of return per unit 
biomass density is usually based on empirical or 
theoretical models of target strength versus 
acoustic frequency.   
 
Sound scattering models use the characteristics of 
the target to compute backscatter for any user-
selected frequency.  The development of analytical 
sound scattering models is a complex problem in 
applied physics, and beyond the scope of this 
discussion.  However, once an adequate model has 
been developed, it can be used to predict the 
backscatter intensity for any target that conforms 
to the limitations of the model.  A variety of 
models has been developed for fluid-filled spheres 
and prolate spheroids, straight and bent cylinders, 
and even for fish (Anderson, 1950; Stanton, 1989; 
Horne and Clay, 1998).  Fluid-filled organisms 
include taxa such as copepods and euphausiids 
(and, by analogy, mysids and pelagic decapods).  
They are weak sound scatterers and often 
contribute only a minor component of the total 
sound scattering intensity.  Elastic scatterers have 
a reflectivity value roughly 100 times higher than 
the fluid-filled targets (Stanton et al., 1994), and 
include shelled organisms such as thecate 
pteropods.  Although fish and siphonophores with 
gas bladders have the highest reflection 
coefficient, it is important to note their 
morphological features vary with species.  For 
example, some myctophid species have a well-
inflated swimbladder and strong backscatter, 
others have atrophied (or fat-filled) swimbladders 
and weak backscatter (Butler and Pearcy, 1972; 
Neighbors, 1992; Yasuma et al., 2003).  
Mesopelagic fishes are known to have various 
types of gas bladders, from completely absent to 
lipid or gas-filled types, not only by species, but 
also by growth stages, suggesting specific and 
ontogenetic changes in target strength (Butler and 
Pearcy, 1972; Neighbors and Nafpaktitis, 1982).  
Analytical sound scattering models are continually 
undergoing refinement as experimental data 
accumulate and the technology improves (Stanton 
et al., 1998; Stanton and Chu, 2000; Horne and 
Clay, 1998).   
 
Sound scattering models have been used with 
multiple frequencies to estimate the size 
distribution of acoustic targets (Holliday and 
Pieper, 1980; Pieper and Holliday, 1984; 
Greenlaw and Johnson, 1983; Costello et al., 
1989; Pieper et al., 1990; Ressler et al., 2005).  
The multifrequency technique is based on the 
relationship between backscatter and frequency. 
This technique exploits the difference in target 
strength relative to frequency in order to estimate 
the size distribution of targets from volume 
scattering data.  A fundamental condition of the 
multifrequency inverse method is that the ratio of 
the target size to the acoustic frequencies must 
span the transition from Rayleigh to geometric 
scattering (Holliday and Pieper, 1995).  
Unfortunately, the Rayleigh–geometric transition 
zone for many large targets falls below the 
frequency of most commercial transducers (Horne 
and Jech, 1999).  In addition, the number of size 
categories in the acoustic record can often exceed 
the number of frequencies available for the survey.  
In such cases, the inversion algorithm may not 
converge to a unique or reliable solution. 
 
Back-scattering models, with up to 21 frequencies, 
have been used to estimate zooplankton size 
distribution (Costello et al., 1989; Pieper et al., 
1990).  The equipment required to simultaneously 
collect data at 21 frequencies is complex and cost-
prohibitive for most studies.  In addition, such 
equipment has a short effective detection range 
due to the high absorption of sound at high 
frequencies.  It cannot be towed beside the vessel 
but must be lowered on a hydrographic wire with 
the vessel stationary, or towed on an undulating 
vehicle in order to obtain the depth distribution of 
the targets.  It therefore lacks the sampling density 
possible with a towed transducer array.  
Nevertheless, when the size composition of the 
targets is very diverse, multiple high frequency 
sampling may be the only way to obtain reliable 
acoustic density estimates.   
 
In practice, few acoustic studies have a sufficient 
number of frequencies to completely characterize 
the size distribution and species composition of 
the sound scattering targets.  Nevertheless, if the 
micronektonic community is dominated by only a 
few species and size categories, as usually happens  
76 
in nearshore pelagic environments, acoustic 
systems with one or two frequencies may be 
sufficient to characterize the abundance and 
distribution of the target animals.  In the western 
North Pacific, for example, a two-frequency (38 
and 120 kHz) method is available for 
distinguishing E. pacifica from other crustaceans 
(Miyashita and Aoki, 1999).  In such cases, 
backscatter can be scaled with concurrently 
collected net samples (using regression analysis) 
or by applying target strength corrections from the 
literature, or from model calculations (Coyle, 
1998; Coyle et al., 1992; Coyle and Cooney, 1993; 
Macaulay et al., 1995).  With multiple frequencies 
and target types, canonical correlation may help 
identify and scale acoustic data to net data (Coyle 
and Hunt, 2000).  
 
The above approach assumes that net samples are 
a reliable measure of the density of organisms 
detected by the sounder, in other words, that net 
avoidance is negligible.  However, since sound 
scattering can also result from a number of sources 
other than animals retained by a net, correlation 
analysis with net samples will not always produce 
statistically usable results.  Fish, for example, may 
completely mask the weaker acoustic signals from 
crustaceans, resulting in an underestimation of 
crustacean biomass where the fish and crustaceans 
overlap (Coyle and Pinchuk, 2002).  If scattering 
from fish is mistaken for scattering from 
crustaceans, a large overestimate of crustacean 
abundance or biomass will result.  In general, 
correlation cannot help in scaling acoustic data in 
cases where the net sampling tools are assumed to 
be non-quantitative.  Even in those cases where 
significant results are observed, the correlations 
may not be the direct result of sound scattering by 
taxa from the nets.  Thus, using a combination of 
hydroacoustic techniques, underwater video 
camera, and several types of nets during survey 
could provide enough evidence to identify the 
main organisms responsible for most of the 
backscattering recorded by the echo sounder. 
Comparison of the correlating frequencies, as 
identified by canonical loadings, with measured 
and model predictions of volume scattering at 
those frequencies, can help expose such 
correlations.  Even where correlations are 
considered genuine, the researcher must ultimately 
use experience and judgement to decide the degree 
of correlation required to usefully describe the 
distribution and biomass of a given target taxa.  
While a given set of correlation coefficients may 
adequately scale the data on some transects, they 
may produce unacceptable results on other 
transects where the species composition or 
sampling conditions are different. 
 
A substantial number of studies have applied 
acoustics to survey the distribution and estimate 
the abundance of micronektonic organisms in the 
North Pacific, and a complete review of these is 
beyond the scope of this report.  Many of the 
earlier studies were aimed at examining the diel 
distribution and migration patterns of the 
ubiquitous sound scattering layers in the North 
Pacific.  Some of these early studies are presented 
in Farquhar (1970) and Andersen and Zahuranec 
(1977).  Regional observations of mesopelagic fish 
in Oregon waters (Pearcy et al., 1977; Kalish et 
al., 1986), in the Central Pacific (Benoit-Bird and 
Au, 2003), western North Pacific (Yasuma, 2004), 
Bering Sea (Yasuma, 2004), Japan/East Sea 
(Hamano and Uchida, 1992; Hamano et al., 1992; 
Noda and Moriwaki, 1996; Ohshimo, 1998), as 
well as elsewhere in the Pacific Ocean (Koslow et 
al., 1997) are provided.   
 
Numerous studies of pelagic crustacean (mainly 
euphausiid) distributions determined with higher 
frequencies are also available from throughout the 
North Pacific Ocean (Pieper, 1979; Pieper et al., 
1990; Coyle and Cooney, 1993; Mackas et al., 
1997; Miyashita et al., 1997, 1998; Swartzman et 
al., 1999; Gómez-Gutiérrez et al., 2000; Ressler et 
al., 2005). 
 
7.3 Video Observations (Submersible and 
ROV) 
 
Our ability to directly observe the distribution, 
ecology, and behavior of mesopelagic organisms 
has progressed greatly since the first observations 
of myctophid fishes during bathysphere dives off 
Bermuda (Beebe, 1935).  Barham (1963, 1972) 
described the composition and behavior of a 
mesopelagic community in a sound scattering 
layer off southern California, based on 
observations from 50 dives in a variety of 
submersibles.  He noted that different mesopelagic 
fishes showed different types of behavior which he 
77 
was able to classify as “active” (residing in 
shallower waters) and “inactive” (residing in 
deeper waters).  Backus et al. (1968) examined 
scattering layers using the ALVIN submersible in 
the North Atlantic and found them to be composed 
of dense aggregations of a single species of 
myctophid (Ceratoscopelus madrensis).  Dense 
aggregations of myctophids, cephalopods, and 
sergestids were observed off Cape Hatteras, 
U.S.A. in the Atlantic by Milliman and Manheim 
(1968).  Robison (1983) examined associations of 
myctophids with other mesopelagic organisms in 
Monterey Bay, California.  More recently, Auster 
et al. (1992) made underwater observations in 
canyons south of New England, U.S.A. using the 
Johnson Sea-Link submersible, and described 
multispecies associations of myctophids, other 
fishes, euphausiids, sergestids, and ctenophores.  
The authors suggest that this behavior reduces 
predation on these myctophids and helps them 
locate common prey.  Another type of anti-
predator behavior has been described by Robison 
(1999) who noted that elongate fish and other 
midwater organisms assume a circular shape to 
mimic medusae and other unpalatable prey.  
Finally, Hunt and Lindsay (1999) observed 
midwater fauna off Japan, using both submersibles 
and unmanned Remotely Operated Vehicles 
(ROVs) and observed 11 species of midwater 
fishes, although their emphasis in this study was 
primarily on gelatinous zooplankton.  
 
The use of scientific submarine and ROV 
technology has substantially improved our ability 
to learn about micronekton behavior, feeding 
habits, and predation–prey interactions that are 
impossible to obtain using nets, optic and/or 
acoustic devices (Wiebe and Benfield, 2003). 
Using these technologies has also enabled 
researchers to collect specimens virtually intact for 
physiological and taxonomic studies.  Submarine 
and ROV technology can be also applied to 
acoustic systems as well as video systems (Sawada 
et al., 2004; Takahashi et al., 2004), and 
observations of deep-sea organisms will be able to 
provide more quantitative information by 
combining these systems.  Relatively inexpensive 
video camera systems that can be deployed as any 
regular CTD or plankton/nekton net can 
significantly increase our understanding of 
schooling of fish and swarming behavior of 
pelagic crustaceans.

8. Summary of Present State of Knowledge
8.1 Fish Micronekton 
 
The present knowledge of micronektonic 
mesopelagic fishes in the North Pacific can be 
summarized as follows: 
 
1. Taxonomic problems are mostly resolved, 
particularly for the common species that are 
regarded as being ecologically important 
because of their high abundance. 
2. Larval taxonomy is almost established for the 
common species in the subarctic, transitional 
and subtropical waters, with the exception of 
the genera Diaphus and Lampanyctus, but 
there are relatively few scientists familiar 
with their identification. 
3. Egg taxonomy is not established for most of 
the mesopelagic fishes.  Myctophid eggs 
have been described for only 3 of about 230 
species in the world oceans, which has 
limited our understanding of myctophid 
spawning seasons and grounds.  
Development of a new sampling gear is 
necessary since plankton nets have not been 
effective at collecting their fragile eggs. 
4. Using a genetic approach would contribute to 
the confirmation of not only both established 
and ambiguous larval and adult taxonomy, 
but would also help to differentiate between 
different populations of this widely 
distributed fish group. 
5. Zoogeographic distribution patterns are 
mostly depicted for adults, but are not yet 
determined for many larvae, which cause 
difficulties in separating expatriate 
populations from feeding populations that 
migrate into subarctic waters, including the 
Bering and Okhotsk Seas.   
6. Diel vertical migration patterns have been 
studied for the subarctic and transitional 
water species. Ontogenetic changes in 
migration depth, especially from juveniles to 
adults, have been reported, but this subject 
needs to be examined further. 
7. Knowledge of spawning behaviors, including 
spawning depth, timing, and schooling 
behaviors within spawning aggregations is 
almost totally lacking at present.  
8. Life history studies are restricted to several 
dominant species.  Parameters for production, 
mortality, and reproduction are needed but 
are hard to obtain due to the lack of suitable 
sampling methodology and seasonal data, 
especially during winter in subarctic waters. 
9. Knowledge of the ecological roles of these 
fishes in oceanic ecosystems is restricted to 
feeding habits of several dominant species in 
the North Pacific.  Daily rations, feeding 
impact on zooplankton biomass, predators 
and predation rates have been studied for 
several transitional and subarctic species. 
Generally, spatio-temporal habitat 
segregation, through different DVM patterns 
and resource partitioning, appears to be very 
common in the micronektonic fish 
community. 
10. Marine mammals (such as fur seals and 
porpoises), seabirds, large pelagic and 
benthic fishes, and squids are all known to be 
predators of mesopelagic micronekton, but 
this information is scattered in the literature 
on stomach content analysis of various 
predatory animals.  The relatively soft fragile 
body of most mesopelagic fishes may have 
caused an underestimate of the importance of 
micronektonic fishes in many predator diets. 
11. The nutritional values of myctophid fishes 
have been studied in terms of their protein 
and lipid quality, and most species have been 
found to be not so different from those of 
other epipelagic fishes, including 
commercially exploited species.  Wax ester is 
contained in several vertically non-migratory 
or semi-migratory species. 
12. Quantitative biomass estimates are restricted 
to only a few species because an effective 
quantitative sampling technique has not yet 
been established. It is known that 
commercial-sized trawl nets are more 
effective than traditional micronekton nets, 
but quantitative evaluation of these larger 
trawls is needed.  We suggest that once this 
80 
evaluation method, including the use of 
acoustics, has been established, biomass 
estimates at species level would be possible, 
based upon the discrete depth sampling in the 
habitat of each species. 
 
8.2 Crustacean Micronekton 
 
The present knowledge of micronektonic 
mesopelagic crustaceans in the North Pacific can 
be summarized as follows: 
 
1. In terms of body size and sampling 
considerations, more of the euphausiid and 
mysid species fall between the range of 
macrozooplankton and micronekton than the 
other, more stereotypic, micronektonic taxa 
(e.g., myctophids, small squids, and pelagic 
decapod shrimps). Epipelagic adult 
euphausiid total length is usually 1–3 cm, but 
mesopelagic species range between 3–12 cm 
total length.   Both juveniles and adults can 
be caught with conventional meso-
zooplankton nets, but capture efficiency can 
be low (especially in daylight).  Recent 
studies recommend that fast trawls and larger 
net mouths should replace conventional 
plankton nets when the main goal is to catch 
euphausiids.  
2. Trophic niche is often species- and location- 
specific, but the most abundant North Pacific 
euphausiids are omnivorous (on large-celled 
phytoplankton) and carnivorous (on juvenile 
and adult mesozooplankton).  However, it 
was recently discovered that euphausiids feed 
actively on marine snow (> 0.5 mm) even 
when other sources of food are available, and 
that they can also actively fragment marine 
snow, perhaps playing a significant biological 
agent in the biogeochemical cycle of 
particulate organic carbon.  
3. Taxonomy and identification of late juveniles 
and adults of euphausiids, mysids, and 
pelagic decapods are well established at the 
genus and species level, as are the large-scale 
zoogeographic patterns.  
4. Taxonomy and identification of eggs and 
larvae for broadcast spawning species, 
required to estimate spawning areas, 
intensity, and duration, as well as larval 
recruitment, are needed.  Species-level 
identification of earlier larval stages is 
possible for some of the most abundant and 
ecologically-important North Pacific 
euphausiid species, but expertise in taxonomy 
and published identification guides for about 
half of the euphausiid species is critically 
lacking.  Of the 56 euphausiid species 
distributed in the North Pacific, the biometry 
of the eggs of only 20 species has been 
measured.  Because all mysid species are sac-
spawning, the spawning areas, intensity, and 
duration are theoretically easier to study but 
there is relatively little information about 
their spawning in the North Pacific. 
5. Life history strategies (maturation rate, 
seasonal timing and frequency of 
reproduction, and feeding type) and larval 
developmental sequences can be quite 
variable within a species (even in the same 
population), and may be cued by local 
environmental conditions. The variability of 
age structure dynamics, multiple spawning 
with overlap of generations, and body 
shrinkage during unfavorable conditions 
complicates traditional models for the 
interpretation of growth, mortality, and 
secondary production rates. 
6. Most detailed time series observations of 
feeding, growth, development, and metabolic 
rates have been from nearshore sub-
populations, even for species with trans-
pacific ranges.  The reproductive strategy 
(broadcast or sac-spawning) for species of the 
genera Nematobrachion and Tessarabrachion 
is still unknown. 
7. Spatial distributions are extremely patchy in 
the three-dimensional scale.  Most of the 
North Pacific euphausiid species undergo 
significant DVM as juveniles and adults 
(range 50–300 m, variable with age, species, 
location, season, and year-to-year).  Typical 
layer thickness is 5–20 m.  At least in 
continental margin regions, the locations of 
strong horizontal aggregations are correlated 
with bathymetric slopes and with current 
patterns, and daytime scattering layers may 
interact with the benthic boundary layer, or 
 
81 
remain occasionally as daytime surface 
aggregations for feeding and reproductive 
purposes. 
8. Because of their patchy spatial distribution 
and their relatively substantial swimming 
capabilities, spatially-intensive and high-
resolution sampling methods are needed to 
quantify distributions and total stock size. 
The most common method is a combination 
of acoustic-backscatter mapping of scattering 
layer extent and intensity, supplemented by 
targeted net sampling.  Considerable work 
has been done on the development of 
euphausiid target strength models. Most 
models agree to about a factor of 2 to 3 in 
their biomass estimates.  However, there 
remains significant uncertainty due to effects 
of body orientation and interference from 
strong acoustic targets with similar depth 
distribution (e.g., pteropods and 
siphonophores). Optical and acoustic 
information can extract behavioral 
information not easily obtained with 
conventional net sampling, such as the 
velocity of DVM, size, compactness, and 
density of the euphausiid aggregations. 
Swimming and swarming behavior of 
euphausiids and mysids can be studied using 
underwater video cameras to better 
understand the social association among 
members of the same aggregation. 
9. Euphausiids are the primary and preferred 
prey for a large number of North Pacific 
finfish, squid, pelagic decapods, seabirds, and 
marine mammal species.  
10. Spawning areas and duration of the spawning 
seasons are relatively well known for only a 
few of the dominant euphausiid species 
(Euphasia pacifica, Nyctiphanes simplex, 
Thysanoessa inermis, T. spinifera, and T. 
raschi) but more research is needed for other 
species particularly in the Transitional Zone 
and Transitional Domain areas. 
11. Although Euphausia pacifica, E. nana, 
Thysanoessa longipes, T. raschi, and 
T. spinifera are part of a relatively small-scale 
fishery in Japan, United States, and Canada 
using dip or trawl nets, there is a lack of 
reliable estimates of the standing stock and 
vital rates of these euphausiids in the North 
Pacific.  It is necessary to study the dynamics 
of their populations, secondary productivity, 
and the ecological impact of this pelagic 
component to set precautionary catch limits 
in order to avoid short-term, or permanent 
damage, to natural population levels of their 
predators as has been the situation for the 
Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba (Hewitt et 
al., 2002). 
 
8.3 Cephalopod Micronekton 
   
The present knowledge of micronektonic 
cephalopods in the North Pacific can be 
summarized as follows: 
 
1. As with most micronekton, much of what we 
know about cephalopods in the North Pacific 
centers on the common, generally coastal, 
species that have been identified as 
ecologically important and/or are highly 
abundant, thereby facilitating obtaining 
samples.  Away from coastal waters (i.e., 
open oceans), our knowledge of virtually all 
aspects of this group diminishes considerably. 
2. For many of the cephalopod families 
encountered in the micronekton, it is the 
juvenile and subadult forms that are typically 
represented in net sampling and which are 
found in the diets of higher-level predators.  
As expected, species-specific life history and 
ecological information for these 
developmental stages are even more difficult 
to come by than what is available for the 
adults.  
3. Particularly lacking are data on the life 
history and ecological relationships of the 
neutrally buoyant cephalopods (e.g., 
Histioteuthidae and Cranchiidae). 

 
83 
9. Recommendations
On the whole, a large amount of data on the 
biological features of micronekton has been 
accumulated over the last few decades and it 
should not be too difficult to fill the remaining 
gaps in the near future from the standpoint of 
fisheries oceanography.  We are only now 
beginning to understand how micronekton 
populations vary over longer time scales that may 
relate to climate change (Brodeur et al., 2003; 
Watanabe and Kawaguchi, 2003b). These 
preliminary results strongly suggest close dynamic 
interactions among climate change, physical 
oceanographic variability, and epipelagic-
mesopelagic marine ecosystems.  
 
The next step towards developing our knowledge 
of this huge biomass in the oceanic ecosystems 
should be the establishment of quantitative 
sampling techniques to accurately assess their 
distribution and abundance patterns.  This will also 
greatly contribute to quantitative sampling of 
juvenile fishes of the commercially important 
species, which is essential for predicting their 
stock fluctuations.  Based on the consideration 
mentioned above, we would, therefore, 
recommend that the following studies be 
conducted toward gear development: 
 
1. Quantification of the extrusion rate through 
the mesh of commercial-sized trawl related 
by various sized micronekton using 
underwater cameras, videos, or by fine mesh 
nets attached to the outside of the trawl to 
catch the extruded animals; 
2. Development of a reliable neuston net (A 
bridle-free neuston net is preferable.) that 
could be towed simultaneously with the trawl 
along the side of a ship;  
3. Development of a micronekton net for 
discrete depth sampling of smaller-sized 
micronekton (<5–7 cm), such as RMT-8, 
MOCNESS, and Tucker Trawl, which should 
be towed in combination with the 
quantitatively established large trawl; 
4. Development of opening/closing bridleless 
pop-up nets to sample in deep water or from 
ships without the ability to deploy large 
trawls; 
5. Expansion of visual techniques using towed 
or mobile cameras systems and comparison 
of the species composition and densities 
obtained from these methods to those from 
net systems presently being used. 
 
As a result of the recommendations of this 
working group, PICES formed an Advisory Panel 
of the Micronekton Sampling Intercalibration 
Experiment in 2002 to plan a cruise (or several 
cruises) to compare micronekton sampling gears 
and other quantifying technologies, such as 
acoustics and visual sampling methods, similar to 
that done in the Atlantic Ocean utilizing mainly 
plankton gears (Wiebe et al., 2002).  The Advisory 
Panel will oversee planning and implementation of 
the field program and dissemination of the results 
to the scientific community.
