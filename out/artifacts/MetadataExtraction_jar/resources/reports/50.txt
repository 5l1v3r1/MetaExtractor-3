PICES Scientific Report No. 50 vii 
Summary 
There are many applications and uses of spatial distributional data on marine birds and mammals in the 
North Pacific, including the design of pelagic marine protected areas, assessments of ecosystem health, 
modeling top-down effects of marine predators on food web dynamics, and projected future distributions 
of rare or threatened populations and species under climate change.  Distributional data come in many 
different flavors, including ship-based observations of density and remotely-sensed tracking and 
movement data.  These data provide complementary perspectives on species distributions but should not 
be combined for a variety of reasons including different spatial and temporal scales and resolution.  There 
are many high quality datasets on marine birds and mammals in the North Pacific available for analyses, 
including the North Pacific Pelagic Seabird Database and the Seabird Tracking Database.  More 
information is becoming available all the time. 
Because ship-based and tracking observations are not spatially and temporally comprehensive, species–
habitat models (i.e., coupling of apparent spatial distributions with biophysical factors that predict species 
distributions) are necessary.  There are many different and highly technical approaches to habitat 
modeling or species distribution modeling; composite model output may provide optimal information, but 
this depends on the goals of study.  
 
 
 
Section 1  Introduction 
PICES Scientific Report No. 50 1 
1 Introduction 
Marine birds and mammals (MBMs) are important marine top predators that consume substantial 
amounts of zooplankton and micronekton in the North Pacific (Hunt et al., 2000).  These taxa are of 
considerable conservation and management interest, yet are vulnerable to changes in marine food web 
structure and function as well as a variety of anthropogenic impacts, from contaminants to competition 
from fisheries.  Marine birds and mammals are resilient, in part because they are highly mobile. 
Importantly, this feature of their life history can be relatively easily observed and tracked to determine 
their spatial distribution and abundance.  Owing to their conspicuousness, MBMs can be spontaneous 
sentinels of ecosystem change, a feature that makes them of critical importance to monitoring and 
assessing the “health” of the North Pacific. 
MBMs are not distributed evenly across the seascape but tend to aggregate at various temporal and spatial 
scales due to physical forces, biochemical factors, prey distribution, and behavioral and social factors.  
The coupling (i.e., spatio-temporal associations) of their distributions at sea with biological and physical 
factors (hereafter referred to as biophysical factors) is a subject of great interest and importance (Coyle et 
al., 1992; Hunt et al., 1993, and many others).  Habitat models are a specific form of spatial ecological 
modeling that couples observed locations of organisms with biophysical factors that co-occur in space 
and time.  These models have been variously referred to as bioclimatic models, climate envelopes, 
ecological niche models (ENMs), species distribution models (SDMs), and resource selection functions 
(RSFs) (Elith and Leathwick, 2009).   
MBMs are relatively large and conspicuous marine organisms, making data collection on their 
distribution and movement relatively easy to accomplish, and providing useful information for marine 
spatial planning and management (Hyrenback et al., 2000; Louzao et al., 2006; Worm et al., 2003; 
Hooker, 2008).  Additionally, the identification of biological hot spots (i.e., regions where abundance 
and/or biodiversity are relatively high) based on distribution and movement patterns, and elucidating the 
underlying biophysical mechanisms that drive these hot spots, is critical for fisheries management and the 
conservation of MBMs.  
Over the past several decades, a wide variety of research programs have collected ship-based 
observational and individual-based tracking data of MBMs throughout the North Pacific.  Observational 
survey data are essentially bird counts, controlling for area covered, and these data are collected from 
ships or aircraft.  Tracking involves monitoring the movement birds using devices or “tags” attached to 
individual birds which are deployed then recovered (data stored internally, using GPS or position of the 
sun), or they are devices that send out signals which can be used to derive position (radio telemetry), or 
signals that are picked up by satellite systems.  Tracking data is typically composed of locations at 
specific times.  Portions of these data have been compiled into large databases.  The U.S. Geological

exist, however, and need to be integrated for more complete coverage of all PICES regions.  Although 
comprehensive, these databases are not complete as there remains a large number datasets in the PICES 
region that have yet not been integrated into these two databases, and therefore, these data are largely 
unavailable to PICES marine scientists.

Section 1  Introduction 
PICES Scientific Report No. 50 3 
Over the last decade, the Advisory Panel on Marine Birds and Mammals (AP-MBM) has organized 
sessions and workshops on spatial ecology of marine birds and mammals.  At the 2004 PICES Annual 
Meeting (Honolulu, USA), AP-MBM convened a Topic Session on “Hot spots and their use by migratory 
species and top predators in the North Pacific”.  Selected papers from the session were subsequently 
published in Deep-Sea Research II (Sydeman et al., 2006).  AP-MBM also convened a Topic Session on 
“Mechanisms of physical-biological coupling forcing biological hotspots” at PICES-2011 (Khabarovsk, 
Russia), and selected papers from the session were published in Marine Ecology Progress Series (Hazen 
et al., 2013b). 
To further incorporate MBMs into the objectives of PICES’ integrative science program, FUTURE 
(Forecasting and Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific Marine 
Ecosystems)
3
, AP-MBM proposed to concentrate efforts on MBM spatial ecology and conservation as a 
priority topic for 2012–2014 activities; three goals or primary objectives were proposed.  These goals can 
also be linked to other components of PICES (Fig. 1.3).  The primary objectives are to:   
1) synthesize distribution data on MBMs and their temporal change in the North Pacific based on ship-
based surveys and remote tracking, 2) examine the biophysical factors associated with the distribution 
and abundance of MBMs and their ecological/economic (fisheries) hot spots, and 3) provide information 
on important ecological areas throughout the North Pacific to increase understanding of MBM spatial 
ecology and to provide information on the sustainable use of marine resources within the organization.  
Recent AP-MBM activities were focused mainly on the first and second objectives.  There are extensive 
datasets for marine bird and mammal distribution in the North Pacific, especially from recent decades, 
with increased ship-based bird and mammal surveys and the proliferation of individual-based electronic 
tracking studies.  These two methodologies, however, provide different aspects of animal distribution and 
while complementary, are not easily integrated.

 (1) understand how marine ecosystems in the North Pacific respond to climate change and human activities, 
(2)  forecast ecosystem status based on a contemporary understanding of how nature functions, and (3) communicate 
new insights to its members, governments, stakeholders and the public. 
Introduction Section 1 
4 PICES Scientific Report No. 50 
Here, we review methodologies and identify the most promising approaches for integrating ship- and 
individual-based species distribution data.  We also discuss how habitat modeling can be a powerful tool 
to facilitate the integration of datasets and to examine the factors affecting the distribution of MBMs.  
Although AP-MBM did not fully accomplish objective 3, the results provide a foundation by which these 
objectives can be addressed in the future.  To achieve the three objectives described above, AP-MBM 
organized and convened a series of topic sessions and a workshop on spatial ecology of marine birds and 
mammals between 2012 and 2014 (see Appendix).  At PICES-2012 (Hiroshima, Japan), AP-MBM 
organized and convened a BIO/MEQ Topic Session (S6) entitled “Environmental contaminants in marine 
ecosystems: Seabirds and marine mammals as sentinels of ecosystem health”.  In this session AP-MBM 
tried to identify spatial patterns and geographic areas of concern for pollutants or other stressors using 
bio-indicator species, and explored mechanisms of transport and fate of contaminants in marine 
ecosystems.  The AP also discussed health risks for certain predators and human consumers.  At PICES-
2013 (Nanaimo, Canada), AP-MBM held a BIO Workshop (W3) on “Marine bird and mammal spatial 
ecology” in which 29 participants representing data holders, analysts and data users attended.  Topics 
discussed were:  1) existing datasets and gaps, 2) applications, and 3) data integration.  A primary goal of 
the workshop was to assess techniques to compile and integrate ship-based marine bird and mammal 
surveys with individual tracking datasets and to determine how best to model species distribution and 
habitat use.  Furthermore, AP-MBM convened a BIO Topic Session (S2), entitled “Strengths and 
limitations of habitat modeling: Techniques, data sources, and predictive capabilities” at PICES-2014 
(Yeosu, Korea).  A wide variety of taxa were represented in the presentations, including deep-sea sponges 
and corals, zooplankton, krill, squids, seabirds and marine mammals.  A primary objective of the session 
was to examine factors causing biases, identify the direction of biases, discuss techniques for mitigating 
or accounting for biases, and create a best practices guide for using habitat modeling approaches to 
predict the distribution of marine organisms in dynamic marine environments. 
In Section 2, the outcomes of the workshop held at PICES-2013 are summarized, and we discuss 
challenges and limitations that are particular for ship-based survey and tracking data using two case 
studies as illustration.  In Section 3, we introduce habitat modeling and discuss the strengths and 
weaknesses of this approach, and review the types of data that most marine habitat models are based on.

2 Integrating Tracking and Ship-based Survey Data 
2.1 Introduction 
Individual tracking and ship-based surveys provide valuable insight into the distribution of free-ranging 
MBMs.  These two data types provide different but complementary perspectives on questions regarding 
spatial ecology (Camphuysen et al., 2012).  The benefit of using individual tracking data most relevant to 
spatial ecology is that they are unrestricted by study area boundary, season, time of day, or weather 
conditions.  With individual tracking one can also determine how movements vary with age and sex of 
the individuals being tracked (Table 2.1).  The benefits of ship-based surveys, on the other hand, include 
collecting data with larger sample sizes, on multiple species from a single sampling platform (enabling 
community analyses based on these data), data on individuals of all life stages, including non-breeding 
birds, and simultaneous in situ sampling of biophysical variables (often concurrent with MBM 
observations), permitting fine-scale habitat analyses (Table 2.1).

Tracking and Ship-based Survey Data Section 2 
6 PICES Scientific Report No. 50 
There are many opportunities for tracking and ship-based survey data to be integrated.  However, to date 
there are few published examples, and most have focused on seabirds.  The combination of tracking and 
ship-based survey data can initially provide a more robust estimate of at-sea distributions of single 
species (Priddel et al., 2014; Perrow et al., 2015) or communities (Ballard et al., 2012).  Likewise, 
tracking studies combined with fisheries bycatch data allow for a similar combination of tracking and in 
situ observational data (Hyrenbach and Dotson 2003; Zydelis et al., 2011).  In some cases, tracking data 
and ship-based survey data have been used in synergy to identify marine hot spots (Hyrenbach et al., 
2006; Hughes et al., 2015; Bennison and Jessopp, 2015; Yamamoto et al., 2015) or to test the accuracy of 
distribution models based on the other types of data such as projecting foraging range from the colonies 
(Grecian et al., 2012).  
Given these complementary strengths, it is clear how advantageous it would be to integrate the two data 
types to provide a more holistic view of animal distribution.  There are, however, important limitations 
within each data type that complicate efforts to combine these inherently different data categories. 
2.2 Biases 
Being fundamentally different, tracking data and ship-based survey data types also require different 
assumptions, face different constraints, and present different analytical challenges (Camphuysen et al., 
2012).  Models can be biased differently depending on whether they are based on ship-based observational 
survey or tracking of individual animals.  With some exceptions (e.g., Block et al., 2011), individual 
tracking data are often limited to relatively small sample sizes of individuals.  However, these few 
individuals can produce tens to hundreds of thousands of locations each.  Additionally these individuals are 
generally not randomly selected for tagging, and neither is the distribution of the start of tracks and 
subsequent locations.  A colony effect where at-sea densities of individuals are exaggerated due to transit to 
or from an onshore attraction (e.g., seabird colonies, pinniped rookeries or haul-outs) is not only a common 
bias with tracking data, but can also impact ship-based survey data.  Likewise, non-representative sampling 
of a population or a region is an important concern for both data types.  Fortunately, plausible analytical 
methods exist to accommodate some of these biases (e.g., Renner et al., 2013; Whitehead and Jonsen, 
2013).  Ultimately, these potential biases need to be identified and addressed in the respective models before 
attempts can be made to quantitatively combine distribution surfaces produced by models based on survey 
and tracking data. 
2.3 Case studies 
The effect of different tagging locations vs. ship-based surveys  
In the California Current System (CCS) off North America, multiple studies have been conducted using 
different approaches to determine the distribution and abundance of black-footed albatrosses (Phoebastria 
albatrus).  During an initial satellite tracking study, birds were tagged at their breeding colony on Tern 
Island in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (outside the U.S. exclusive economic zone; EEZ) and 12 
birds were tracked.  They entered and moved throughout the central and northern CCS (Fernández et al., 
2001; Hyrenbach et al., 2006; Kappes et al., 2010).  In a second satellite tracking study, 36 albatrosses 
were captured and tagged at Cordell Bank in the central CCS (inside the EEZ) and were tracked 
throughout the CCS (Guy et al., 2013, Hyrenbach and Hester, unpubl. data; Fig 2.1).  Comparison of 
Section 2  Tracking and Ship-based Survey Data 
PICES Scientific Report No. 50 7 
these two tracking studies show different patterns of albatross distribution with the bias of tagging 
location evident for birds tagged within the CCS (cf., Fig. 2.1A and 2.1B).  Most albatrosses tagged in the 
central CCS (the second study) remained within it for a while and then left; the remaining few moved 
north through the CCS.  In contrast, albatrosses that were tagged outside of the CCS (the first study) 
entered it at different locations but primarily used continental shelf break habitat in the central and 
northern CCS (Fig. 2.1B).  Overall, the distribution of birds tagged outside of the CCS (Fig. 2.1B) 
showed more similarity to the distribution determined by ship-based surveys (Fig. 2.1C).  This example 
highlights differential habitat use based on tagging locations that need to be accounted for either through 
sampling design with deployment strategies or quantitatively in the analyses (Whitehead and Jonsen, 
2013).

Spatial extent of tracking vs. ship-based surveys   
Eighty-seven sooty shearwaters (Puffinus griseus) were tracked over 6 years (Adams et al., 2012) and 
compared to sooty shearwaters observed during 22 years of ship-based surveys in the central CCS 
(Santora et al., 2011).  Density distribution surfaces were created using a Brownian bridge movement

model (weighted by the number of uplinks per cell and bird) to show a spatial intensity of satellite-
tracked individuals (Fig. 2.2A) and a kernel density from ship-based surveys (Fig. 2.2B).  Where the 
spatial extent of the two approaches overlapped, there was reasonable agreement in core areas of high 
use.  Discrepancies between the two data types resulted from non-contiguous sampling of the ship 
transects (i.e., gaps between survey lines).  Tagged birds showed higher concentrations nearshore where 
larger survey vessels were unable to survey because of shallow water depth.  Additionally, there was a 
much larger overall spatial extent from unrestricted movements of individually tracked birds compared to 
fixed vessel transects.

density distribution from 22 years of vessel-based surveys.  Both datasets were collected primarily during spring and 
summer of each year.  Data from J. Santora, J. Adams, B. Henry and W. Sydeman. 
Similarly in the Bering Sea, tracking data from black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla; 73 individuals, 
over 200,000 locations) during the breeding season on the Pribilof Islands (Paredes et al., 2014) can be 
compared to 30 years of ship-based surveys around this colony (over 100,000 records; North Pacific 
Pelagic Seabird Database).  Comparison of these datasets highlights typical biases in both approaches.  
The tracking data are biased by 1) location of the colony where birds are tagged since breeding birds are 
conducting foraging trips to and from the colony (Fig 2.3A) and by 2) breeding stages of birds since 
chick-rearing birds should make more trips than incubating and non-breeding birds.  Ship-based surveys, 
on the other hand, include all age classes and breeding and non-breeding individuals and thus provide a 
more uniform sampling of the entire region (Fig 2.3B).  A fundamental shortcoming of fixed transect 
surveys, however, is also highlighted in this comparison because in some years breeding birds are found

to extend their foraging range well beyond the continental shelf break, where very few ship transects 
occur, and especially at night (Paredes et al., 2012),.  For a more standardized comparison between data 
types, kernel densities of tracking data can be scaled to breeding colony size and compared to surface 
distributions from ship-based surveys (Fig. 2.3C, D).  Surface distributions from both data types show 
high use areas near the colonies and the continental shelf break to the south, but also show differences in 
higher use of off-shelf for tracking (Fig. 2.3C) and inner shelf for ship-based surveys (Fig. 2.3D); 
highlighting how well the two data types complement each other.

Significant environmental factors derived from tracking vs. ship-based surveys  
Short-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris) were tracked using geolocators in the Bering, Chukchi, 
and Beaufort seas (19–27 birds per year for 2 years; Fig. 2.4A, B, E, F).  In the subsequent two years, 
ship-based surveys were conducted through this same region in July and September (Fig. 2.4C, G) where 
16,000–18,000 short-tailed shearwaters were observed each year.  To find important environmental 
factors explaining the density of short-tailed shearwaters, Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were 
created using remotely-sensed explanatory environmental variables of sea floor depth, bottom slope, sea 
surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a).  Environmental factors associated with the bird 
density, based on tracking data and ship-based surveys, were then compared qualitatively (statistical 
significance level and the sign of the parameter estimates) within and between seasons (July or September). 
 
 
Fig. 2.4  Kernel density surfaces (50 × 50 km) and habitat modeling (GLM) results of short-tailed shearwater 
distribution from individual tracking (geolocation) and ship-based surveys in the Bering Sea during July (A–C) and

between time periods.  Data from Y. Watanuki, B. Nishizawa, Y. Yamamoto, E. Labunski, K. Kuletz, C. Meathrel 
and R.A. Phillips. 
Section 2  Tracking and Ship-based Survey Data 
PICES Scientific Report No. 50 11 
Despite some differences in the significance of explanatory variables between tracking and ship-based 
models (for example, positive relationship between density and depth based on ship-based survey data 
collected but negative relationship based on tracking data collected, in July), relationships between 
densities and explanatory variables generally showed more similarity between types of data within 
seasons rather than between seasons (for example, positive relationship between density and bottom slope 
in July, and negative in September; Fig. 2.4D, H).   
Therefore, this basic modeling comparison of a relatively small dataset shows promise in a likely 
preferred direction for integration of initially creating habitat use models independently, then combining 
models to produce a unified distribution surface. 
2.4 Data integration 
Many studies have used both ship-based and individual tracking data where species and spatial coverage 
overlap, and although data are typically modeled independently, there have been various levels of 
integration of model output (Table 2.2).  Tools such as OBIS–SEAMAP provide a dynamic way to 
visualize multiple datasets and thus provide the initial steps towards integrating modeling efforts (Fujioka 
et al., 2014) or a combined tracking and survey model.   
Table 2.2 Examples of studies using both individual tracking and ship-based survey data to model species 
distribution.  Two of the studies, Louzao et al. (2009) and Thiers et al. (2014), produced separate “side-by-side” 
models for tracking and survey, not integrated surfaces.  The two other studies combined outputs to produce a 
distribution showing where kernel densities from tracking differed from modeled distribution from surveys (Benoit-
Bird et al., 2013).

12 PICES Scientific Report No. 50 
In some cases, investigators have taken the approach of building distinct models based on the two 
datasets and then interpreting the resulting model outputs separately (Hyrenbach et al., 2006; Louzao et 
al., 2009; Thiers et al., 2014).  For instance, Louzao et al. (2009) used ship-based survey data to identify 
large-scale habitat and then tracking data to identify small-scale feeding habitat of Cory’s shearwater 
(Calonectris diomedea).  Both datasets were modeled separately, and a comparison of the model results 
showed differences in the scale of habitat use and highlighted different spatial areas.  Similarly, Thiers et 
al. (2014) built separate predictive spatial models based on tracking and ship-based survey of frigatebird 
distributions using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) and suggested that the differences in the 
resulting distributions reflect breeders and non-breeders.  These studies, however, produced separate 
“side-by-side” predictive models and did not quantitatively integrate individual tracking and ship-based 
survey model outputs to produce a single density surface (Table 2.2).   
Benoit-Bird et al. (2013a) provide examples where density surfaces based on tracking and survey data 
were merged.  In their study, ship-based survey data for fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus), thick-billed murres 
(Uria lomvia), and black-legged kittiwakes were modeled using multiple linear regression models with the 
distribution and density of prey measured with acoustics and hydrographic data collected concurrently to 
create predicted density surfaces for each species.  Density surfaces based on individual global positioning 
system (GPS) tracking data were created using Kernel Density Estimators for each species.  Then the 
density surfaces based on tracking data were subtracted from the predicted density surfaces created by the 
ship-based survey data regression models to produce a single “difference” layer showing where densities 
of tracked birds were different from those predicted from the ship-based model.  This comparison also 
highlights the strong colony/rookery effect of breeding birds and fur seals from colony/rookery-based 
tracking studies.  Another approach to quantitatively integrating the two data types is to use detailed 
information from one data source to inform the other.  For example, Yamamoto et al. (2015) used tracking 
data to model the relative density of groups (e.g., sex, colony, and breeders vs. non-breeders) in the form of 
Generalized Additive Model (GAM) response curves to weight habitat models from ship-based surveys 
where group identity was cryptic.  This technique is described in detail in Section 3. 
2.5 Conclusions 
Animal distribution determined by ship-based surveys and individual tracking provide different analytical 
challenges, but ultimately can be highly complementary.  At this point, there is limited possibility for 
integrating ship-based survey and tracking data prior to modeling efforts because of inherent constraints 
and biases that vary between the two types of data collection.  Combining output density surfaces is 
promising.  However, creating a combined density surface requires more complex data-specific 
treatments prior to integration.  After data-specific treatments are applied, there are considerably more 
options for quantitative integration of the two data types.  For example, information on area use by 
tracked individuals of different age, sex, or breeding status can be used to inform age- or stage-specific 
predictive surfaces from ship-based surveys.  To produce a combined density distribution surface, habitat 
use models should be first created independently for individual tracking and ship-based surveys, then 
combined through ensemble or other model averaging approaches to create a single predicted distribution 
layer from the two datasets.  With the continued use of ships of opportunity for conducting at-sea bird and 
mammal surveys along with miniaturization and economical production of tracking devices, spatial data 
for these organisms are accumulating at a rapid pace.  While extensive analyses of distribution, 
abundance, and habitat use from ship-based surveys and individual tracking have been published 
independently, integration of these large-scale, complementary datasets will be a major step in developing 
a more complete understanding of bottom-up processes from local to ocean basin scales.

3 Strengths and Limitations of Habitat Modeling 
3.1 Introduction 
Models for exploring spatial pattern  
Habitat modeling is a tool used to explore the statistical relationships between the distribution of organisms 
(presence/absence or the number of organisms in unit area; “response variable”) and biophysical 
characteristics of their environments (“explanatory variables”) (e.g., Guisan and Zimmermann, 2000; 
Redfern et al., 2006).  Innate characteristics (age, sex, etc.) of organisms can be explanatory variables.  
There are two other general approaches for exploring and predicting the spatio-temporal distributions of 
marine organisms: ecosystem modeling and individual-based models.  Ecosystem modeling involves the 
parameterization of physical, chemical and biological processes (feeding, growth and reproduction rates) 
and their interactions in ecosystems, and calculates the densities of producers and primary and secondary 
consumers at small spatial scales (grid cells usually greater than 4 × 4 km) over the ocean (e.g., Franks, 
2002; Kishi et al., 2007).  Ecosystem modeling requires information regarding trophic relationships and 
time series data on density and distribution of organisms to parameterize and evaluate the model 
performance (Fulton, 2010).  Individual-based modeling, on the other hand, assumes some simple rules to 
describe the movement of individual organisms (e.g., speed and direction), and estimates the positions of a 
large number of individuals under given or modelled biophysical conditions (Dorman et al., 2011).  This 
approach requires knowledge about the rules describing the movement of individuals, which is often unclear 
for most species.  The latter two approaches can be computationally intensive and require significant 
knowledge about animal behavior, physiology and/or trophic relationships.  The ecosystem modeling and 
individual-based model approaches have been rarely applied to MBMs because of the considerable 
requirements of ecological information, including life history, foraging and prey data.  Furthermore, 
physiological requirements such as the direct and indirect response to temperature, often used as factors for 
deciding recruitment and movement of poiko-thermic zooplankton and fish, are uncertain for MBMs.   
Habitat modeling makes use of integrating multiple empirical datasets and is a simple and useful approach 
for predicting species habitat preference and response to environmental variability without requiring 
significant ecological data on organisms and their prey (Fig. 3.1).  The spatial distribution of organisms is 
easier to record than measuring the consumption/production efficiency, growth rate, reproduction and 
movement rules.  Habitat modeling is less computational to construct using desktop computers and can be a 
good starting point to understand the effects of environmental biophysical factors.  However, habitat 
modeling is a non-deterministic statistical approach based on statistical correlations and spatio-temporal 
associations, so it is difficult to draw conclusions about the mechanisms driving the distribution.

Operating Characteristic, AUC = Area Under the ROC Curve.  See Table 3.3 for other acronym definitions. 
Applications and pitfalls of habitat modeling  
Habitat modeling is a powerful tool to make inference and predictions on the distribution of marine 
organisms.  Applications include, but are not limited to: 1) finding key factors affecting the distribution of 
marine organisms (e.g., Guisan and Zimmermann, 2000; Redfern et al., 2006), 2) predicting optimal fishing 
grounds for efficient and sustainable fisheries (e.g., Santos, 2000; Klemas, 2013), 3) evaluating the impacts 
of  human activities on individual species or communities (Renner et al., 2013; Bombosch et al., 2014) for 
marine spatial planning (Humphries and Huettmann, 2014) or for species conservation (Chivers et al., 
2013), and 4) identifying or projecting shifts in distribution or future potential habitat in the face of climate 
change (Hazen et al., 2013a; Chust et al., 2014).  
Habitat models, however, are never perfect, and can often over-fit the data or have poor predictive 
capabilities (even though they explain most of the deviance).  Habitat modeling predicts the expected 
distribution of a population based on a limited amount of environmental data collected concurrently with 
ship-based surveys, remotely sensed data, or modeled oceanographic data to characterize the species’ habitat 
requirements (Becker et al., 2010; Alabia et al., 2015).  Difficulties with habitat models can arise from 
Section 3  Strengths and Limitations of Habitat Modeling 
PICES Scientific Report No. 50 15 
numerous sources that are not accounted for in the model, such as biases in the underlying surveys (tracking 
vs. ship-based survey), the sampling time and regions, the lack of key explanatory variables, inappropriate 
spatial scales, inappropriate extrapolations, behavioral responses, and limits of the modeling algorithms 
(Elith and Graham, 2009).  Thus evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of habitat modeling approaches 
is increasingly important particularly for MBMs, as they live in highly dynamic environments.  
In this section, we will review the factors that may introduce bias, limit effective inference, and/or reduce 
performance of habitat modeling, and discuss techniques for mitigating or accounting for these factors. 
More specifically, we will: 1) review types of response and explanatory variables, 2) clarify the assumptions 
(biological, statistical, and environmental) that limit the predictive power and bias the outcome of habitat 
modeling, and 3) discuss how we can mitigate against the biases of model selection by averaging several 
models (ensemble models). 
3.2 Innate limitation: Biology of organisms 
Response that may change across time and space  
Habitat modeling assumes that species distribution patterns are the direct result of their preference for a 
specific combination of environmental conditions (Barry and Elith, 2006; Elith and Leathwick, 2009). 
However, species habitat may be restricted by geographical barriers, inter-specific competition, or the 
moving ability of a given species that are usually not taken into account in habitat modeling.  Hence, 
“occupied distributional area” is only a subset of the full “potential geographic distributional area” of a 
species (Peterson et al., 2011), harkening back to the concepts of realized vs. fundamental niches (Connell, 
1961).  Failure to occupy such potential areas may also arise from previous extirpation or vagaries of 
biogeographic history, or simply from the lack of population expansions.  These factors should be 
considered as a stochastic element for the prediction of species distribution.  Such phenomena are 
commonly referred to as contingent historical factors in biogeography (Patterson, 1999). 
Habitat modeling relies heavily on environmental variables to predict species distribution, which makes 
them vulnerable to behavioral responses of organisms to variation in these environmental conditions 
particularly when these responses vary across regions, seasons and years.  For example, this is particularly 
problematic for migratory species which may depart a summer area earlier than a habitat model may predict 
if it were based on local environmental conditions as explanatory variables alone.  Over larger spatial and 
time scales, adaptive changes may take place, which are usually not taken into account.  However, 
increasing evidence suggests that the organisms can respond to ongoing climate change, adapting to new 
environment by means of phenotypic plasticity without altering their genetic constitution, or by means of 
genetic changes through the process of evolution (e.g., Bearhop et al., 2005; Parmesan, 2006; Gienapp et al., 
2008; Visser, 2008; Weimerskirch et al., 2012).  Therefore, the potential adaptive responses (i.e., flexibility 
of behavioral and physiological responses) of species also should be considered during evaluation of habitat 
modeling exercises. 
  
Strengths and Limitations of Habitat Modeling Section 3 
16 PICES Scientific Report No. 50 
Inherent factors: Age, sex, body condition and breeding status  
Sex-, age-, and condition-related habitat differences have been reported extensively in many species of 
seabirds (e.g., Forero et al., 2005; Lewis et al., 2005), marine mammals (e.g., Breed et al., 2006; Crawford 
et al., 2012) and fish (e.g., Sims, 2005; Farley et al., 2007; Wearmouth and Sims, 2008).  These differences 
in the habitat preference likely relate to physical and biological differences such as body size (Lewis et al., 
2005; Weimerskirch et al., 2012), competitive exclusion (González-Solís et al., 2000; Forero et al., 2005), 
energy or nutrient requirements (Ruckstuhl and Neuhaus, 2005), and breeding constraints (Phillips et al., 
2004; Yamamoto et al., 2011; Crawford et al., 2012; Catry et al., 2013).  However, habitat models often do 
not include information on sex, age, and condition or breeding status.  With fisheries information, only data 
for fishable age and sex classes of targeted species may be available.  Individual tracking data may be biased 
as data typically come from individuals that are most easily tagged (e.g., incubating parents of seabirds, 
female adult sea turtles on nesting beaches) leading to potentially significant gaps in our understanding of a 
species’ habitat use (Hazen et al., 2012).  With ship-based surveys of seabirds and marine mammals, age, 
sex, and condition or breeding status of observed individuals is usually unknown.  
In some cases age, sex and condition or breeding status can be determined.  For example, age and sex of fish 
can be identified in fishery logbook or observer data.  Also, information on the spatio-temporal movement 
of individuals can be obtained in concert with biological data (i.e., sex, age, and condition/breeding status) 
using recent animal-borne tracking techniques (see review by Burger and Shaffer, 2008; Rutz and Hays, 
2009).  Sex and age can be treated as fixed explanatory variables.  If the identity of observed individuals is 
available, it can be treated as a random factor in the habitat model, where modeling algorithms allow.  In 
this way, the integration of tracking and ship-based data could help resolve this issue (see below). 
During the breeding season, seabirds and seals have to commute between their colony or rookery and 
foraging areas.  The position of the colony is therefore a constraint to the distribution for these central place 
foragers (see Section 3.4).  This constraint can be addressed by adding a colony-effect explanatory variable, 
comprised of the sum of the inverse distances from all colonies, scaled by the size of colonies (see Renner et 
al., 2013 for details).  Complicating factors could exist in relation to changes in attendance patterns at the 
colony over the course of a breeding cycle.  In seabirds, both adults typically attend the colony prior to egg 
laying, alternate brooding and foraging duties during incubation and early chick rearing, and then both 
spend most of their time at sea as the chick approaches maturity. 
3.3 Response variables 
Sampling techniques  
Distribution data of marine species are collected using a variety of sampling techniques.  Sampling 
techniques can be categorized into three types: 1) ship-based and aerial line-transect surveys (we discuss 
ship-based surveys only), 2) fisheries-dependent data (i.e., log data, observer data, satellite-based detections 
of fishing light distributions), and 3) animal tracking (Table 3.1).  These techniques likely contain different 
biases such as the selection of the survey line and season, tagging location of tracked animals, traits of the 
sample animals, type of fishing activities, and biased sampling of the population.

Raymond et al., 2015 
Animals are tracked by telemetry or biologging 
techniques. Information on place that animals do 
not use cannot be used.  
  
* Density data indicate the number of animals per unit area or CPUE (catch per unit effort) or SPUE (sighting per unit effort).  Effort includes the number of net tows, the 
number of hooks, filtered water volume, observation time, and the distance of each transect line.  Count data are often used as dependent variables. For this case, the effort is 
treated as an offset term in habitat models.

1.  The ship-based line transect surveys are often used to study the distribution of marine mammals and 
seabirds (by sighting), fish (by acoustic survey and trawl samples), phytoplankton (by continuous sampler 
and automated analyzer) and zooplankton (by the Continuous Plankton Recorder or CPR: Batten et al., 
2003).  Thus data are limited within a survey area, along survey lines or within surveys swaths (i.e., area of 
coverage along survey lines).  Given a fixed width of ship-transects (e.g., 300 m from the boat for seabird 
surveys), and estimates of detectability and flux (Tasker et al., 1984; Spear et al., 1992; Buckland et al., 
2001), the number of animals observed can be converted into an estimate of density.  The survey line can be 
systematically determined according to program objectives and surveys.  However, surveys can also be 
based on ships of opportunity and clustered in space and seasonal coverage.  
2.  Fisheries logbook data and observer data are used to study the distribution of commercial fishes and 
squids, benthic marine invertebrates, and bycatch of top predators.  Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) is 
typically used as the response variable.  In many cases, effort with zero catch goes undocumented.  This is 
considered a challenge for researchers who study the distribution of these commercial species, as this 
undocumented effort makes it difficult to define a total study area represented by the catch data.  
3.  Animal tracking based on a satellite-linked platform terminal transmitter (PTT) or global positioning 
system (GPS) data-logger attached to animals has been used often for studying the distribution and 
movement of a small portion of the population of large seabird species and marine mammals.  Tracking data 
can be examined using mixed models on a track-by-track basis, or after aggregating data, e.g., into density 
per grid cell (Block et al., 2011; Yamamoto et al., 2015).   
Spatial resolution varies among data collection techniques (Table 3.2).  For line transect data, spatial and 
temporal resolution can be relatively fine (e.g., as fine as 300 m) and from seconds to 10 minutes.  For point 
sampling, spatial resolution is usually 0.1–1°.  Fishing log data is usually aggregated over 0.25° ~ 1° × 1° 
cells and month by fisheries investigations where data collected during a month or so is summarized 
(Syamsuddin et al., 2013; Robinson et al., 2015).  GPS tracking gives the finest spatio-temporal resolution 
(1 s, ~10 m) while spatial resolution of PTT-based tracking is broader (day, ~10 km).  Geolocators 
determine positions based on the timing of sunset and sunrise, providing at most one fix per day with an 
error of ~100 km, depending on the season and location.   
Data type  
Data collected by each of the above techniques can be categorized as one of three types: presence-only, 
presence/absence, or density/count data.  
1.  Presence-only data contain sighting information of any number of animals in a cell, but have no 
information of where a species was not detected or where no survey effort was made.  Thus presence-only 
data have the least stringent requirements for data quality, and can be acquired from numerous sources 
including museum records, casual observations, and tracking data.  For example, fishing-lights detected 
using satellite imagery as an index of squid distributions can be treated as presence-only data as this index of 
squid location would only be effective inside squid fishing grounds.  
2.  Presence/absence data contain information where a species was not detected, which does not necessarily 
imply that it was actually absent.  For example, cetaceans and seals make long dives so often that density 
cannot be estimated without making assumptions about time spent underwater.  The likelihood of any 
detection also decreases with distance from the observer, so a recorded absence is somewhat dependent on 
the local density of the studied organism.  Thus cetacean sightings data are sometimes treated as presence-

PICES Scientific Report No. 50 19 
only or presence/absence data.  Logically, tracking techniques provide only presence-only data, as the entire 
population is not sampled.  However, techniques for creating pseudo-absences for tagging data (i.e., random 
walk generation techniques, for example) may outperform presence-only approaches, but additional studies 
are needed to ensure this is the case (VanDerWal et al., 2009; Wingfield et al., 2011; Willis-Norton et al., 
2015). 
3.  Density/count data is the number or biomass of animals caught or observed per unit effort, i.e., CPUE. 
Effort includes the area of net tows for the otter bottom-trawl, the number of hooks for long-line (Mugo et 
al., 2010; Howell and Kobayashi, 2006), time by the number of hooks for squid jigging, filtered water 
volume for plankton net sampling, transect line distance by swath width (as area) for marine bird and 
mammal surveys.  In some cases, CPUE data are treated as presence-only or presence/absence data, such as 
for bigeye tuna long-line fishing log data (fish per 100 hooks was converted to presence/absence data; 
Syamsuddin et al., 2013) and for squid jigging data (mass of catch was converted to presence-only data; 
Alabia et al., 2015).   
In habitat modeling, presence-only data and presence/absence data are assumed to follow a binomial 
distribution, while density data tend to follow a highly skewed non-Gaussian distribution such as Poisson, 
Tweedie or negative binomial (over-dispersed).  These data can also be zero-inflated.  
The quality of response variable will dictate what kind of predictions can be made.  Presence-only data have 
the least stringent requirements regarding data quality, and accordingly the interpretation of the predicted 
distribution may be difficult.  Presence/absence and presence-only models can provide a probability of 
occurrence, or a simple yes/no of reaching a pre-defined probability threshold.  Models based on density 
data, on the other hand, provide a density surface that could allow estimates of regional population sizes, 
population trends over time, and distribution shifts within a species’ range (e.g., Renner et al., 2013).  
Data type and modeling approaches  
Depending on the data type, four categories of model approaches are available (Hirzel et al., 2002; Elith and 
Graham, 2009; Phillips et al., 2006; Panigada et al., 2008; Stockwell and Peters, 1999).  1) Presence-only 
approach uses environmental data at locations where animals are present.  2) Presence/background 
approach uses presence-only data and the environmental variables at the locations of species occurrence are 
compared to the entire survey area.  3) Presence/absence approach uses presence/absence data and assesses 
the potential ranges using differences in environments between the location of presence and absence 
(Breiman, 2001; Peterson et al., 2011).  We can make pseudo-absence data through random sampling of 
absence cells, then use the presence/absence approach for presence-only data (Wisz and Guisan, 2009).   
4) Density/count approach uses density/count data to assess gradients and non-linear changes in species 
density across the environmental seascape.  A problem associated with converting count to the density or 
CPUE is that information on sampling effort variability is lost and probability distributions may not 
accurately reflect true animal distributions as a result.  To resolve this, sampling effort can be treated as an 
“offset” term in habitat models (Zuur et al., 2009a).

3.4 Explanatory variables 
Environmental variables  
Environmental variables can be dynamic (vary with time) or fixed.  Dynamic environmental variables may 
vary spatially, temporally, or both.  Sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (SSS), height (SSH), and 
Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) are dynamic environmental variables that can be collected during ship-based surveys. 
As well, these variables can be derived from satellite remote sensing or from hydrodynamic and simulated 
oceanographic models (Table 3.2).  Temporal and spatial variations of these environmental factors are used 
as an explanatory variable since variability across time (or predictability) and space can be an important 
proxy for mesoscale processes.  As an example, spatial gradients in SST may indicate hydrographic features 
such as convergent fronts (Cayula and Cornillon, 1992, 1995, 1996), and marine organism are known to 
associate with fronts (Scales et al., 2014).  The upwelling index can be calculated by strength and direction 
of the wind and alongshore wind stress (Bakun, 1973).  The stratification index is calculated as a function of 
density, salinity and temperature (Ladd and Stabeno, 2012).  
The resolution of these dynamic environmental variables depends on the sampling tools.  For satellite-
derived data, the finest spatial resolution is 500 m (e.g., SST and Chl-a) and ranges through 0.25° (slope of 
SSHa and geostrophic current) to 1° (SSS; Table 3.2).  However, we can scale up (i.e., reduce spatial 
resolution) using GIS software (e.g., ArcGIS and SeaDAS) to ensure appropriate spatial resolution is used. 
Temporal scales of satellite data products range from daily to long-term climatology (e.g., SST and Chl-a, 
Table 3.2).  Data collected during ship-based surveys, such as the density of prey, water turbidity, and 
salinity, have high spatial and temporal resolution but have the major drawback that predictions over the 
entire study area tend to be impractical, as data collection is constrained to survey lines.  These explanatory 
variables can also be aggregated to potentially more suitable larger temporal and spatial scales (see Section 
3.6). 
Bathymetry or bottom substrates are examples of static environmental variables which can be derived from 
bathymetry or other features such as landmarks (seamounts, estuaries or coastlines) (Amante and Eakins, 
2009).  There are numerous examples of derived static environmental variables such as bottom slope, 
bottom rugosity (variability in depth or roughness), shelf-break location, distance from shelf-break, distance 
from seamount, distance from coast, or distance from estuary.  
Prey  
Prey is an important environmental factor affecting the distribution of predators, although it is relatively 
unexplored because prey distribution data are not easy to collect.  Acoustic volume backscatter data can 
provide a metric of prey density which can be used for habitat modeling (Murase et al., 2002; Hazen et al., 
2009; Hazen and Johnston, 2010; Benoit-Bird et al., 2011; Hazen et al., 2011).  Murase et al. (2002) found a 
simple correlation between concentration of cetacean and large aggregation of euphausiids determined by 
acoustics.  Several studies used acoustic volume backscatter data as input in habitat models and showed 
non-linear relationships between cetacean abundance and prey density (Friedlaender et al., 2009; Laidre et 
al., 2010).  Also, volumetric backscatter often is less important than prey patch structure (e.g., density, patch 
size, patch separation distance) as predators rely on dense aggregations of prey for efficient foraging (Hazen 
et al., 2007; Benoit-Bird et al., 2013a,b).  Even when prey data are available, the lack of broad spatial 
coverage severely limits the potential applications of models incorporating prey densities.

Spatial CPUE and fishing log data can be also used as explanatory variables although these are often 
collected at a resolution that is too low to be useful (Torres et al., 2008).  Indeed, dedicated field sampling 
may be the only way to collect sufficiently high-resolution information on prey.  However, it is often 
difficult to sample the entire study area.  An alternative technique is to use the modeled spatial pattern of 
density of prey species that is derived from individual-based models or ecosystem models.  To use modeled 
prey density surfaces, the model predictions should be evaluated using reference data.  Further, collinearity 
(some variables are highly correlated) between the predicted density of prey species and other explanatory 
variables (i.e., variables that were likely used to model prey species) must be checked and accounted for in 
the final habitat model (see below). 
Competitor/predator  
The presence of other species (competitors/predators) can be an important environmental factor affecting 
species distribution (Franklin, 2010), but is usually not included in the habitat models (Wisz et al., 2013) 
simply because of a lack of data.  If there is information on biotic interactions between species (e.g., 
predator–prey, competition, and facilitation), presence/absence or density of the other species can be an 
explanatory factor.  One approach is to integrate pairwise dependencies using surrogates for biotic 
interaction gradients and another is to hybridize models with dynamic models (e.g., Sebastian-Gonzelaz et 
al., 2010).  However, as mentioned in Wisz et al. (2013), biotic interactions are not constant in time and 
space, and species interact across complex networks.  
Innate factors  
As described in Section 3.2, many innate factors influence habitat utilization.  For this reason, age, sex, and 
condition and breeding status should be used as explanatory variables in habitat models.  Location of the 
colonies constrains the choice of feeding area in breeding seabirds.  Therefore, distance to the colony should 
be included as an explanatory variable.  
Collinearity  
Environmental variables (SST, SSH, etc.) are often correlated each other.  If so, it is necessary to check for 
collinearity (highly correlated variables) and eliminate explanatory variables, as necessary, or combine 
several variables into a single index using Principal Component Analysis (PCA, see Section 3.7). 
Approaches to test and account for collinearity are discussed in detail in Zuur et al. (2007).  
3.5 Selection of the models 
Groups of models  
The choice of the model depends largely on the type of response variables.  Above, we have summarized the 
different types of response data.  We will briefly discuss suitable models and model selection for practical 
usage (see Oppel et al. (2012); Praca et al. (2009); Austin (2007); Araújo and New (2007); Araújo and 
Guisan (2006) for details).  We also will discuss the biases introduced by the scale of analyses, year and 
regions, and validation techniques. 
Habitat models are categorized into four groups, depending on statistical model types: profile methods, 
regression methods, machine learning methods, and geographic methods (Busby, 1986, 1991; Hastie and

Model selection and evaluation  
The best-performing model (or models) is (are) selected using a number of suitable algorithms.  There are 
numerous techniques to select models.  To choose the best performing model, predictive performance is 
often used (Peterson, 2005; Peterson et al., 2011).  Although frequently used today, step-wise model 
selection should not be guided by statistical tests of significance, as this has been widely discredited, 
producing spurious results (e.g., Mundry and Nunn, 2009).  Alternatively, selecting suitable potential 
models that fit hypotheses to be tested a priori is a better approach.

Section 3  Strengths and Limitations of Habitat Modeling 
PICES Scientific Report No. 50 25 
There are several statistics that can be used to measure model and/or predictive performance and these 
include simple correlation, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Area 
Under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve (AUC), Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation 
(LOOCV) or K-fold Cross-Validation (k-fold CV), and the True Skill Statistic (TSS) (Johnson and Omland, 
2004; Allouche et al., 2006; Elith and Graham, 2009; Elith et al., 2010; James et al., 2013).  To evaluate the 
predictive performance, first, the model is constructed by using a subset of data (“training”).  Then 
evaluation (“calibration” or “test”) of the selected model is carried out by using the remaining data that were 
not used for training (Huberty, 1994; Guisan and Zimmerman, 2000; Franklin, 2010).  For presence-only 
models, the goal is to test if the model predicts positive value (localities of presence for species) better than a 
random prediction.  For presence/absence models, the AUC (Redfern et al., 2006) of ROC plot represents an 
overall measure of the model performance.  AUC ranges from 0 to 1, and 0.5 corresponds to the expected 
performance of random classifier.  If there is no single model supported by the data, model averaging can be 
used (Johnson and Omland, 2004). 
Ensemble prediction  
Modeling techniques vary in terms of robustness and performance (e.g., Yen et al., 2004; Oppel et al., 2012; 
Renner et al., 2013), and to address this, ensemble modeling techniques have been developed.  Ensemble 
models are composed of more than one habitat model, and ensemble predictions are calculated as weighted 
averages of predictions from each constituent model, with weights assigned to each modeling technique 
based on its discriminatory power as measured by the evaluation statistic (e.g., AUC).  Predictions by the 
ensemble model are often more robust than predictions derived from a single model (Araújo and New, 
2007; Marmion et al., 2009; Thuiller et al., 2009; Oppel et al., 2012).  However, predictions can also suffer 
as results from good models may be diluted by results from poor models (Peterson et al., 2011).  This could 
be solved by including only robust models, based on the evaluation statistics, or combination of model 
outputs via some objective weighting scheme such as weighting based on evaluation statistics (Marmion et 
al., 2009), or spatial weighting if one model has better performance in specific areas than others.  A second 
risk is that mixing the results of different methods may create difficult problems of interpretation although it 
may be not matter much if one is interested primarily in predictive ability.  
An example for streaked shearwaters (Calonectris leucomelas) is shown in Table 3.3.  The models were 
based on the position data of tracked individuals using light-based geolocators and included four techniques, 
Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Random Forest (RF), and 
ensemble model (Yamamoto et al., 2015).  AUC (i.e., assessing the performance of models) and Cross-
Validation techniques were used to rank the models (Potts and Elith, 2006; Oppel et al., 2012).  
Furthermore, the Pearson correlation coefficient, and the slope and intercept of a linear regression of the 
observed vs. predicted values were used to evaluate the bias and consistency of model predictions.  The 
slope and the intercept of this regression indicate the calibration and the bias of the model, respectively 
(Phillips and Elith, 2010). 
In the above analysis, the RF had the highest AUC and highest correlation in the prediction followed by 
ensemble model, but showed larger calibration error and bias.  The machine learning methods, including 
RF, usually provide excellent discrimination between areas of presence and absence.  However, when used 
on spatially independent data, these methods likely suffer proportionally more (e.g., larger biases) from 
over-fitting than parametric models such as GLM and GAM.  GLM was not applicable in this case, 
probably because the responses of streaked shearwater to environmental variables are non-linear (i.e., they 
appear to exhibit a preference for particular ranges of SST; Yamamoto et al., 2011).

3.6 Scales and seasonal and regional variations 
Choice of scale  
Spatial resolution of response variables may be from 100 to 1,000 m (density or presence/absence of 
seabirds and whales based on tracking and ship-based survey) and 1° × 1° (density or CPUE of tuna species 
based on logbook or observer data) (Table 3.1) while spatial resolution of explanatory variables may be 
100 m (re-analyzed temperature and salinity) and 4 km (satellite-based Chl-a) (Table 3.2).  The relative 
importance of explanatory variables explaining a species’ distribution and abundance can be highly scale 
dependent (Soberón, 2007).  The appropriate scale may depend on the biology of target organisms, 
including movement scales, longevity, and sensing ability since all these influence the scale of habitat 
selection by individual organisms.  
There are many studies showing that the association between the density of prey and predator depends on 
the scales of analyses.  For example, the spatial association of murre density with the density of prey 
(capelin, krill) is weak at the 0.2 to 1 km scale and strong at the 2 to 10 km scale (Schneider and Piatt, 1986; 
Mehlum et al., 1999).  This indicates that the distribution of murres and prey overlap at a 10 km scale where 
density of the prey patch is high on average but murres are unable to detect each prey patch at a 0.1 km scale 
efficiently, presumably because of their sensory constraint and moving ability.  Alternatively, sampling at a 
larger scale may sometimes significantly reduce the power of inference as important features may be 
overlooked.  If a fine-scale process such as prey distribution is measured at a large scale, it may not have 
explanatory power in the model (Torres et al., 2008).  The scales where strong positive associations between 
prey and predator are observed may depend on the scales of the searching behavior of predators (scales of 
Area Restricted Search: ARS) and the scales of the spatial organization of prey patches.  Scales of ARS are 
80–100 km for albatross species (Weimerskirch et al., 2007; Pinaud and Weimerskirch, 2005) and 2–5 km 
for murres and rhinoceros auklets (Y. Watanuki, unpublished).  Usually, we do not know the scale of prey 
searching behavior for each species of predators a priori, so analyses should be carried out at various scales 
to find the one where explanatory power is strongest.  Nishizawa et al. (2016) modeled the distribution of 
Laysan (Phoebastria immutabilis) and black-footed albatrosses (P. nigripes) at 4 to 80 km scales in the 
Northwestern Pacific and found a greater coefficient of determination at the 80 km scale than at the 4 km 
scale.  
Seasonal and inter-annual variability  
Organisms may have different responses to environmental variables in different seasons, different years, or 
under different climate phases (Grebmeier et al., 2006; Moore and Huntington, 2008).  As well, they may 
respond differently to their environments, depending on their innate life cycle (breeding/foraging season), 
interactions with other species, and food availability (Hazen et al., 2012).  For example, in the North Pacific, 
Alabia et al. (2015) found that preferred SST (derived from the models) of neon flying squid 
(Ommastrephes bartramii) differed between January and February (Northwestern Pacific fishing ground) 
and June to July (Central Pacific fishing ground).  These sources of temporal variability can be treated as 
fixed or random effects in a habitat model.  It is often difficult to separate the effects of season, breeding 
status, and food availability because these factors are often correlated.  Furthermore, the range of 
environmental factors or explanatory factors (e.g., SST) can change seasonally or over the years.  Fish 
respond to SST, for example, during the spring when SST may vary between 5 and 15°C, while the response 
may disappear during the summer when SST is more homogeneous.  So, SST may be included in the best 
performing model in the spring but not in summer.  
Section 3  Strengths and Limitations of Habitat Modeling 
PICES Scientific Report No. 50 27 
When we are not interested explicitly in the effects of season or year, they can be included as random effects. 
To construct a model with random effects, there are three general approaches: random intercept, slope or 
including both (Zuur et al., 2009b).  The random intercept model assumes that the baseline varies among 
years and seasons.  If the response variables vary with time, a random slope model can be used.  The random 
intercept and slope models are used when variability occurs in both parameters.  Kanaji et al. (2015) 
constructed habitat models for short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) in the Northwestern to Central 
Pacific separately during the summer from 1983–2006.  The predicted distribution looks similar among years, 
although the inter-annual changes of the Kuroshio might have influenced the whales’ habitat.  Their paper 
does not describe the differences in the model and those in the explanatory variables in detail among years. 
Regional variability  
Organisms show different responses in different regions.  Organisms may adapt to regional or local 
environments.  Stability (repeatability or persistence) of environmental factors may differ among regions. 
For example, Torres et al. (2015) constructed habitat models of grey petrels (Procellaria cinerea) using 
tracking data and oceanographic data from different colonies separately.  Their results indicate that the 
performance of the model constructed using tracking data collected from birds breeding in the subantarctic 
at Antipodes Island was high when the model was applied to data collected from birds breeding at 
Kerguelen Island but the performance of this model was worse when the model was applied to data 
collected from birds breeding at Marion Island.  The authors argued that the models constructed from birds 
breeding at the Antipodes and Kerguelen islands might be over-fitted since habitat usage of these 
populations might be similar.  The potential environment for birds breeding at Marion Island was different 
from that for birds breeding at the other two  islands, so the accuracy of prediction was poor when the model 
derived from birds breeding at Antipodes–Kerguelen islands was applied to birds breeding at Marion Island.  
Another example is the study by Sundblad et al. (2009) who explored environmental factors (Secchi depth, 
salinity and wave exposure) to explain the distribution of larval northern pike (Esox lucius L.) and roach 
(Rutilus rutilus L.) in the Baltic Sea.  They constructed a model using data from one area and year, then 
tested the performance of this model by predicting data collected in a separate area and year, and followed 
the same procedure in reverse.  They found that model performances were high for both directions for roach 
larval presence despite an almost opposite relationship between larval presence and wave exposure, 
suggesting that wave exposure explained minimal variation in larval presence.  For pike larvae, however, the 
model was less successful when tested with data collected in the other area and year.  Sundblad et al. (2009) 
speculated that the species-specific difference in model performances is likely due to differences in terms of 
species ranges along the predictor variables, and emphasize the need to validate model predictions properly.  
These regional and seasonal differences can be included in species distribution models (SDMs) as fixed or 
random effects. If researchers are interested in the magnitude of either regional or seasonal effects, these effects 
must be included as fixed effects in SDMs or separate models must be built for each region and/or season.  
3.7 Case studies in the North Pacific and adjacent seas 
Copepods in the Chukchi Sea  
Temperature, salinity and density of water and the water current are often correlated with each other.  In 
statistical models, these correlated variables cannot be used together in GLM and GAM.  Several studies 
Strengths and Limitations of Habitat Modeling  Section 3 
28 PICES Scientific Report No. 50 
constructed models after one (or more) of these correlated explanatory variables were removed from the 
analyses.  Habitat models for zooplankton are good examples (e.g., surface salinity, temperature and Chl-a) 
(Zarauz et al., 2007, 2008; Silva et al., 2014).  However, when we remove some variables, we may fail to 
recognize important oceanographic features such as water mass defined by the combination of water 
properties (e.g., temperature and salinity).  Further specific combinations of water masses in upper and 
bottom layers cannot be treated as explanatory variables.  To reduce these weaknesses and to catch 
important features of water masses, we can summarize the variable into a few indices prior to conducting 
statistical models (see Section 3.4).  
Sasaki et al. (2016) constructed habitat models using GAM for Arctic copepods collected in the Chukchi 
Sea during the summer seasons of 2007, 2008 and 2013.  The abundance of copepods, sampled using 
plankton nets, was the response variable.  To quantify the marine environmental factors affecting copepod 
distributions, Sasaki et al. (2016) used the depth of the pycnocline (Stockwell and Peters, 1999) and the 
vertically averaged temperature, salinity, and log-transformed Chl-a concentration above (upper layer) and 
below (bottom layer) the depth of the pycnocline.  They then compared the performance of two approaches. 
In the first approach (conventional technique), one of the variables that was correlated with the other was 
removed to mitigate the collinearity.  In the second approach, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was 
used to integrate several physical variables (Fig. 3.2) to produce a composite quantitative index.  The water 
mass index was scored along the first Principal Component axis that was derived using the depth of the 
pycnocline and averaged physical factor in upper and bottom layers.  In addition, vertically averaged Chl-a 
in the upper and bottom layers and the bottom depth were used as environmental variables.  The year was 
included as a random effect.  All best-fit models explaining abundance of copepods included water mass 
indices, Chl-a concentration in both layers and bottom depth.  Sasaki et al. (2016) found that the 
performance (evaluated by R
2
 and RMSE) of the best model (ΔAIC > 2.00) based on the water mass index 
was higher than that of the best model based on conventional methods.

Bryde’s and sei whales  
To explore the differences in habitats between the two species of whales and to identify the boundary of the 
distribution of these two species, different types of response variables were used.  To investigate the 
relationship between the occurrence of closely related Bryde’s and sei whales and their environments, 
Sasaki et al. (2013) used a GLM with binary response based on their occurrence in the Northwestern 
Pacific.  The data were provided by sighting surveys of the Japanese Whale Research Program during May–
August in 2004 and 2005.  As the response variables, they used “(binary) rank” (presence of sei whale equal 
to 1 and presence of Bryde’s whale equal to 0) derived from the occurrence data.  Royle and Dorazio (2008) 
suggested that detection probability can be related to the “power” of the survey method.  In case of 
imperfect sightings, detection probability should be calculated prior to categorizing species to rank.  In 
Sasaki et al.’s (2013) study, perfect detection (all animals are sighted) and identification of Bryde’s or sei 
whale was required.  Since the data of the species’ absence were not used in their study, the model could not 
show the condition of the species absence.  Thus prediction in their study shows only the boundary of 
habitats between both species and does not show the potential habitats of each species.  As the explanatory 
variables, satellite-derived oceanographic features were used, including SST (°C), sea surface Chl-a (mg  
m
–3
) and sea surface height anomalies (SSHAs; cm) during the survey period, and water depth (m).  The 
spatial and temporal scales were 4 km and monthly, respectively.  The presence of sei whales was defined as 
[P(Y = 1)] and that of Bryde’s whales was defined as [P(Y = 0)].  Formulae for the model were as follows: 
P(Y = 1) = α + β1(SST) +β2(Chl-a) +β3(SSHAs) +β3(water depth), 
P(Y = 0) = 1 – P(Y = 1). 
The result of the best-fit model based on AIC, included SST and Chl-a.  The predicted distribution showed a 
clear separation of potential habitats of the two species and the boundary of habitats moved northward as the 
season progressed.  Mainly SST contributed to the patterns of habitat use between the two whale species 
(Fig. 3.3).

Currently, the field of habitat modeling is rapidly evolving.  Although much progress has been made, 
especially on the side of machine learning techniques, much work remains to be done.  For example, we do 
not have an appropriate method for extracting the distributional information contained in tracking studies 
and combining them with the density data sampled by the ship-based surveys.  Likewise, combining the 
properties of tree-based and generalized linear models is a field in which we hope to see much progress in 
the near future.  Bayesian approaches are not discussed here, but often add flexibility in incorporating 
multiple processes and data types (Ward et al., 2015; Thorson et al., 2015a, b).

4 Applications 
Intensifying impacts in marine ecosystems worldwide from regional (e.g., fishing, pollution, mineral 
extraction, and maritime transportation) and global (e.g., climate change) anthropogenic stressors is causing 
increased public concern for the health of North Pacific marine ecosystems.  These stressors can interact and 
impacts can be cumulative.  For example, increases in sea surface temperature via global warming can result 
in changes in primary production via enrichment of waters and fundamentally change food web dynamics. 
Fundamental changes such as these that stem from global anthropogenic stressors can make marine 
ecosystems vulnerable to regional-scale human impacts.  The distribution and abundance of MBMs provide 
valuable insight into how natural and anthropogenic stressors are impacting marine food webs and upper 
trophic level species.  In this report, we reviewed the type of available data and the potential approaches to 
model the distribution and abundance MBMs in the North Pacific.  Once reliable and robust models have 
been developed, they can be used for: 1) understanding and predicting the effects of climatic (“bottom-up” 
impacts) and anthropogenic impacts on marine ecosystems, and 2) understanding how changes in the 
distribution and abundance of marine bird and mammal populations influence marine ecosystems through 
“top-down” (predation and competition) mechanisms.  Moreover, observed and predicted (via models) 
distribution of seabirds and marine mammals can be used to define ecologically and biologically important 
areas (EBSAs) and help inform appropriate management of the areas highly vulnerable to anthropogenic 
impacts.  Thus understanding how and why MBMs distribute themselves as they do should help inform:  
1) the conservation of populations and species of concern (endangered and threated species), and 2) the 
design of marine protected areas under the threats of oil and gas developments, pollutants, aquaculture, 
fisheries, and other anthropogenic threats or stressors. 
To complement and contribute to the FUTURE program, AP-MBM should continue to work in the field of 
spatial ecology relative to climate variability and change, and other human impacts.  Continuing to host 
workshops and topic sessions at PICES Annual Meetings and produce special issues in the primary literature 
will be one way AP-MBM can continue to contribute in meaningful ways to FUTURE.

ecosystem health

Background 
 
Urban and industrial developments in the world’s coastal regions have led to the release of a large number 
of pollutants (heavy metals, POPs, plastics, oils, radioactive substances) into the marine environment.  In 
some cases, these have detrimental effects on variety of marine resources in coastal and offshore areas. It 
is increasingly important to identify sources, subsequent transport through marine physical systems and 
resulting spatial patterns of these anthropogenic stressors.  Compared to river-lake systems, knowledge of 
anthropogenic stressors in marine systems is less understood due to difficulties with detection over wide 
areas and in offshore regions.  As top predators, such as many marine mammals and seabirds, bio-
magnify some of these pollutants, these organisms can be used as bio-indicators of coastal, marine and/or 
food web contamination.  The utility of these ‘sentinels’ was discussed at the PICES-2011 MEQ 
Workshop. This session:  1) identified spatial patterns and geographic areas of concern (high 
concentrations) of pollutants or other stressors in the PICES region using bio-indicator species,  
2) examined mechanisms of transport, and ultimate disposition, of contaminants in marine ecosystems, 
and 3) discussed health risks for certain predators and human consumers.  Review papers, case studies, 
and innovative methods papers on anthropogenic stressors in marine predators were invited, as well as 
papers that distinguished between the effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors.  In particular, studies 
linking predator habitat use with spatial aspects of stressors in the environment and in predators were 
encouraged.  
 
Summary of presentations 
 
Ten talks (5 from Japan, 2 from Canada, 1 from Korea, 1 from Russia, and 1 from UK,) and 4 posters (all 
from Russia) were given.  Spatial patterns and interannual changes in POPs (Persistent Organic 
Pollutants), including PCBs, DDTs, HCHs, and PBDs in marine birds and some terrestrial birds were 
presented, and their usefulness as bio-indicators was discussed.  A common theme among many of the 
presentations was the need to consider age and the trophic level as important factors when evaluating and 
comparing contaminants levels among species or populations.  Case studies of monitoring marine debris 
ashore and POPs in plastic pellets were also presented.  Forty to 50 people, including bird and mammal 
researchers, geochemists, and biochemists attended the session and gave useful discussion.  The co-
convenors discussed the potential for a review paper on the usefulness and limitation of marine birds and 
mammals as indicators of marine pollutants, and the spatial patterns of POPs shown by them in the 
PICES region.

Background  
 
Marine birds and mammals (MBMs) are highly mobile, yet relatively easily observed and tracked to 
determine their spatial distribution throughout the North Pacific Ocean. They are important marine top 
predators that consume substantial amounts of zooplankton and fish, and are susceptible to changes in 
marine food web structure, productivity, and a variety of anthropogenic impacts.  Therefore, MBMs are 
highly visible sentinels of ecosystem health and its change.  To incorporate MBMs into ecosystem based 
management and meet objectives of FUTURE, the PICES Advisory Panel on MBM (AP-MBM) proposed 
to focus on MBM spatial ecology and conservation as a priority topic for their 2012–2014 activities. 
 
Over the past several decades, a wide variety of research programs have collected observational and 
tracking data of MBMs throughout the North Pacific.  Portions of these data have been compiled into 
large databases, such as the North Pacific Pelagic Seabird Database (NPPSD).  Other data sets, however, 
still need to be integrated for more complete coverage of the PICES regions.  Holding the proposed 
workshop is an important first step to compiling and integrating these massive datasets.  In February 2012, 
we held discussions with several of the main data holders/contributors and they expressed broad support 
for this effort. Workshop invitees were contacted over the past year which included data holders, spatial 
analysis experts, and end product users.     
 
Summary of the workshop 
 
There were 29 attendees at the workshop (Table 1).  The structure of the workshop was organized to 
address three main objectives: 1) Datasets, 2) Applications, and 3) Integration. 
   
1. Datasets  
The first four presentations highlighted examples of existing databases that include data representing 
large spatial scales (100,000s km
2
) spanning multiple decades.  Examples of these large databases include 
the NPPSD that contains over 370,571 records (3 km transect segments) covering 282,035 km
2 
spanning 
1974–2012.  Total counts of organisms include over 17 million seabirds and 241 thousand marine 
mammals.  Spatial coverage from this dataset is best within or adjacent to the Exclusive Economic Zones 
of Pacific Rim countries where the majority of cruises have occurred.  Other datasets include additional 
regions such as the Eastern Tropical Pacific.  Regions of limited vessel survey coverage include the low 
to mid latitude central and Western Pacific.  Individual tracking data from marine birds and mammals 
will help to fill some of these gaps, as well as provide greater temporal coverage in some instances, for 
example during winter.

2. Applications  
Three presentations provided examples of individual studies describing how distributional patterns of 
birds (Cassin’s auklets) and whales (minke, sei, and Bryde’s) can change over time, affecting the types of 
prey that they consume or in response to changing prey distribution and abundance.  A fourth 
presentation used a larger animal tracking dataset from the Tagging of Pacific Predators (TOPP) program 
and a cumulative human impact assessment to identify areas of highest cumulative impact.  Interestingly, 
they found that marine sanctuaries were hotspots for use and risk.  It was also discussed that birds and 
mammals do not always co-occur in the areas of greatest prey abundance since their relationship with 
prey is typically non-linear, only requiring enough to satisfy their immediate needs.   
 
3. Integration 
Three of the four presentations described regional studies in the Western Pacific, Bering Sea, and 
California Current where both vessel-based survey data and individual tracking data exist for a model 
species.  One study where only a single vessel cruise through a region in a given year showed how 
restrictive vessel survey data can be relative to individual tracking.  At the broad scale, there was some 
coherence in distribution where the ship and bird tracks overlapped.  However, habitat models from 
vessel- and tracking-based data were quite different.  In other regions, longer time series of repeated 
vessel-based surveys demonstrate how powerful these datasets are relative to the often shorter-duration 
tacking datasets.  Presenters agreed that survey and tracking data are very different, yet highly 
complementary, especially for filling data gaps in perceived species habitat use and seasonal occurrence.  
A fourth presentation described an approach using tracking and environmental data to model habitat use,  
producing a density grid that shows similar patterns to density estimates from vessel surveys in regions 
where vessel and tracking data overlap. 
 
Decisions from the workshop 
1. Datasets  
Compiling all available vessel survey and tracking data into single databases for each data type is much 
needed.  This is, however, an enormous undertaking.  The NPPSD represents one such effort occurring 
over many years, yet does not include tracking data.  Although there are still many datasets that have yet 
to be included in this database, the database is extremely comprehensive and represents the best single 
data source for many species of marine birds and mammals in the North Pacific.  The most 
comprehensive database for individual tracking data is the Tagging of Pacific Predators, but this database 
does not include data from multiple independent programs over many years, like the NPPSD.  It was 
agreed that our group’s effort moving forward should be focused on compiling a list of existing datasets, 
their temporal and spatial extent, and contact information for the data holder.  This could be used in future 
efforts to secure much needed funding for integrating these data into central databases and proposing 
additional studies to fill the spatial or temporal gaps in the data.  
 
2. Applications  
Comprehensive distribution and abundance maps for the North Pacific are extremely valuable for many 
scientific and conservation efforts.  In addition, it was noted that such accurate and comprehensive 
species abundance and distribution maps for marine birds and mammals are unique among marine 
organisms owing to the relative ease of collecting these data.  Furthermore, because broad scale 
distribution of micronekton is poorly understood, the distribution and intensity of MBM aggregations 
may be valuable indicators of key micronekton.  From the AP-MBM perspective, the first application of 
these data layers is to revisit prey consumption estimates for North Pacific marine birds and mammals 
(e.g., Hunt et al.)  With more comprehensive distribution and diet information, the spatially explicit prey 
consumption estimates will be greatly improved over previous efforts, which have received wide usage to 
date, indicating the value and demand for these efforts. 
   
PICES-2013 Appendix – PICES Annual Meeting Topic Session and Workshop Summaries  
50 PICES Scientific Report No. 50 
Additional uses for comprehensive marine bird and mammal distribution data include calibrating outputs 
from regional and basin scale ocean models and projecting future impacts of changing marine ecosystems.  
This is particularly relevant for identifying conservation hotspots and spatial distribution of contaminants 
in upper trophic level consumers (e.g., Ross, Watanuki et al.).  
 
An important consideration is to produce distribution data layers in metrics that are most relevant to 
modelers and other end product users, especially within the PICES community (e.g., FUTURE).  
 
3. Integration 
The group was unanimous in the conclusion that the two types of data are highly complementary, but for 
various sampling and empirical reasons it is not prudent to integrate vessel survey and tracking data 
outright, either quantitatively or qualitatively.  Instead, the two types of data should first be used 
independently to create habitat use models, then secondarily combined in habitat use models to create a 
single predicted distribution (or density) layer from the two datasets.

Background 
 
Habitat modeling is a powerful tool used to identify key factors affecting the distribution of marine 
organisms and underlying mechanisms, to predict optimal fishing grounds, to evaluate human impacts on 
ecosystems, and to project distribution shifts in the face of climate change. Given their broad application 
and utility, evaluation of the strengths and weakness of various modeling approaches is becoming 
increasingly important. Environmental data primarily come from satellite-based SST, SST gradient, SSH, 
Chl-a and their variation across time, and geographic features such as shelf breaks. Distribution data are 
collected from various sources, including ship-based line transect surveys, animal tracking, fisheries 
activities (log data, satellite-based fishing light distribution) and hence contain inevitable biases, including 
the selection of the survey line and season, tagging location of tracked animals, sample sizes, and type of 
the fishing activities. Biases are also inherent in the models being used – Generalized linear and additive 
models (GLMs and GAMs), Random Forests, boosted regression approaches, and Maximum Entropy 
modeling (MaxEnt). The intention of the session was to examine factors causing biases, identify the 
direction of biases, discuss techniques for mitigating or accounting for biases, and create a best-
practices guide for using habitat modeling approaches to predict the distribution of marine organisms in 
dynamic marine environments. 
 
Summary of presentations 
 
This session was a welcome addition to common themes explored in PICES meetings and focused on 
mechanisms of habitat modeling analysis rather than focusing on a specific type of study organism. It was 
well-attended and there was a variety of topics in the presentations, focusing on different ecosystems, 
trophic levels (coral to whales) and at many different scales – from fine-scale predictions to basin-wide. 
 
In his invited lecture, Dr. Hiroto Murase discussed many of the pros and cons between habitat and 
mechanistic models. The former is good for understanding static pictures while the latter is better for 
understanding processes. He used an ensemble of statistical models to predict sei whale abundance in the 
western Pacific and found a range of both predictive accuracy and overall predicted spatial scales. The 
take-home message was that for sei-whale sightings data, Machine-learning models (Random Forests and 
Boosted Regression Trees) and generalized additive models (GAMs) performed best (sequentially). 
However, satellite tracks from sei whales did not seem to match well with the modeled habitat, 
highlighting the need for examining both datasets.  
 
The second invited lecture by Dr. Martin Renner focused on the North Pacific seabird database using 
climatological sightings data. He, like Dr. Murase, used a suite of models, and found that model success 
varied quite a bit. In fact, the ensemble model performed more poorly than some of the individual models. 
In addition, Martin presented that kriging may outperform kernel density for filling the gaps between 
observations.

Dr. Chris Rooper gave a presentation on the habitat modeling of deep sea corals in the Gulf of Alaska and 
Bering Strait. Given the zero-inflated nature of the data, he modeled presence/absence and abundance 
separately in what is termed a hurdle model. He also used a camera sled to groundtruth the trawl catches 
of corals, finding that the camera sled did a better job sampling corals than the benthic trawls. 
 
Dr. Bill Sydeman gave a talk for Jarrod Santora on mechanistically modeling krill hotspots in the 
California Current. He showed that ROMS-model based predictions of krill patch size, intensity and 
persistence were centered at 37° latitude, and intensity and persistence both related well to seabird 
densities that foraged in the California Current. The contrast between mechanistic, individual based 
models presented by Bill and the statistical models presented by the other speakers highlighted the need 
to look at both approaches in concert. 
 
Dr. Hiroko Sasaki gave a talk on predicting zooplankton abundance as a function of the environment. She 
focused specifically on arctic and Pacific copepods and used GAMMs to predict their distribution relative 
to environmental variables with year as a random covariate. Interestingly, the habitat envelopes of the two 
groups of copepods were quite similar, with Pacific copepods having a slightly stronger relationship with 
temperature. 
 
Dr. Irene Alabia gave a talk on habitat suitability models for neon flying squid in the western Pacific. 
Rather than using a single model, she used a model ensemble and like Dr. Murase, compared the results 
from each of the models. The ensemble models were chosen and weighted based on the prediction-based 
validation. There was also quite a bit of variability among years in model success, potentially because of 
the nature of the resource (less vs. more densely aggregated). 
 
Dr. Yoon-Kyung Lee presented on a GIS based habitat map for common squid. Her research used a more 
qualitative method with strong predictive success to sum up the correlations among environmental 
variables and common squid CPUE on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The weighting of each parameter was 
decided based on the frequency of catch and each environmental variable and ultimately the habitat 
envelope data were summed into a habitat probability index. 
 
Dr. Yukiko Inoue presented bycatch models of wandering and black-browed albatross using tag-based 
and fisheries bycatch data. As bycatch is a function of species distribution and fishing effort, multiple 
models were used sequentially. Distribution was predicted as a function of environmental variables and 
predicted for islands without tracking data. Bycatch was predicted in two models: as a function of 
environmental variables and gear type. Unfortunately, the models showed that bycatch mitigation 
techniques did not show an across the board reduction in bycatch but more data are likely needed to make 
a conclusive decision. 
 
Dr. Patrick O’Hara gave a talk on predicting Cassin’s Auklet habitat relative to environmental stressors of 
microplastics and oil. His models were very robust in predicting both survey and tracking-based 
distribution of birds. When overlaying the modeled habitat with microplastics, there was little overlap but 
vessel traffic was directed through important areas. Cassin’s Auklets are of conservation concern for 
Canada and there are ongoing efforts for spatial management around Triangle Island to protect this 
important population. 
 
The final talk was given by Dr. Hiromichi Igarashi who created a near-real time model of neon flying 
squid using ROMS model output. He used a suite of modeling techniques, and created a complex super-
ensemble, regressing the suite of models against CPUE rather than the common approach of weighted 
averaging. Using an EOF on the super-ensemble output he was able to decompose the results based on 
spatio-temporal scale into fine, medium, and large scale. He then was able to highlight how the various 
scales improved in their predictive capacity, in addition to the single vs. super-ensemble, as a function of 
good and bad fishing years.

Conclusions 
 
The suite of modeling techniques presented, with some authors using up to 10 different models, 
highlights the importance of comparing model results. As technological capability continues to increase, 
more complex multi-model ensembles can improve our predictive capacity. In addition, the talks 
examined multiple trophic levels from copepods up to marine mammals, highlighting the need for 
statistical habitat modeling. Finally, the difference between mechanistic (individual-based models) vs. 
statistical (many presented here) was highlighted by a number of speakers. In fact, the possibility of 
combining these approaches, e.g., using the habitat model output as an input for mechanistic models was 
suggested by one of the speakers. This has the potential to greatly improve our capabilities in predicting 
habitat, including for use in near-real time management of fisheries resources. 
 
This session shows the successes of the Spatial Ecology plan by AP-MBM and will contribute to the 3-
year project report.
