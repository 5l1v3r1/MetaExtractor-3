Executive Summary 
 
Request for Advice 
 
The North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES) received a formal request for advice from the 
United States government in October 2003.  The request asked for scientific advice on the implications of 
the 1998 regime shift for North Pacific fisheries.  Following the strong 1997-1998 El Niño, the North 
Pacific climate underwent a rapid and striking transition, the persistence of which suggests that a regime 
shift had occurred.  Previous regime shifts have had serious implications for ecosystems, and 
consequently for fish populations and the fishing industry.  As such, the National Marine Fisheries 
Service requested scientific advice from PICES that addresses six specific questions: 
 
1. Has the North Pacific shifted to a different state or regime since the late 1980s? 
2. What is the nature of the new state? 
3. What are the ecosystem responses? 
4. How long can the shift be expected to last? 
5. Is it possible to predict when the regime will shift back, and what indicators should be used to 
determine when it happens? 
6. What are the implications for the management of marine resources? 
 
This is the first such formal request for scientific advice made to PICES and represents a new direction 
for the Organization.  PICES was formed in 1992 to provide a forum for scientists from throughout the 
North Pacific to compare observations and ideas.  During these years, PICES has focused on 
environmental variation and impacts on marine ecosystems and has organized symposia addressing 
ocean–climate regimes and regime shift impacts on marine resources.  At its first annual meeting in 1992, 
in Victoria, Canada, PICES sponsored an international symposium on climate variability and fish 
production (R.J. Beamish (Editor). 1995.  Climate Change and Northern Fish Populations.  Canadian 
Special Publication of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 121: 739 pp.).  In a 1999 symposium held in 
Vladivostok, Russia, numerous papers identified a strong possibility that a regime shift had occurred in 
1989 (S.R. Hare, S. Minobe, and W.S. Wooster (Editors). 2000. The Nature and Impacts of North Pacific 
Climate Regime Shifts.  Progress in Oceanography 47: 99–408).  A conference held in La Jolla, United 
States, in 2000, focused specifically on climate regimes, ecosystem consequences and impacts on 
fisheries (S.M. McKinnell, R.D. Brodeur, K. Hanawa, A.B. Hollowed, J.J. Polovina, and C. Zhang 
(Editors). 2001.  Pacific Climate Variability and Marine Ecosystem Impacts from the Tropics to the 
Arctic.  Progress in Oceanography 49: 1–639).  Most recently, at a workshop in Victoria, Canada, in 
2003, a PICES Working Group recognized that a simple two-state system was not a sufficient 
representation of regime variability.  Thus, the scientists of PICES have considerable expertise on ocean–
climate regimes, and this topic is of current active research within the Organization and its member 
nations. 
 
Study Group on Fisheries and Ecosystem Responses to Recent Regime Shifts 
 
The PICES Science Board established a 20-member Study Group on Fisheries and Ecosystem Responses 
to Recent Regime Shifts (FERRRS) to provide a response to the United States government’s request for 
advice.  The Study Group was chaired by Jacquelynne King (Canada) and was comprised of PICES 
scientists from Canada (William Crawford, David Mackas, Gordon McFarlane, Jacob Schweigert), 
People’s Republic of China (Qi-Sheng Tang, Jin-Ping Zhao), Japan (Akihiko Yatsu), Republic of Korea 
(Suam Kim), Russian Federation (Victor Lapko), the United States of America (Harold Batchelder, 
Jennifer Boldt, Anne Hollowed, Alec MacCall, Nathan Mantua, James Overland, Jeffrey Polovina, 
Franklin Schwing) and PICES ex-officio members (Alexander Bychkov, Stewart McKinnell, Ian Perry). 
2 
Provision of Advice 
 
The Study Group met February 9–10, 2004, in Victoria, Canada, to organize activities and to outline a 
report which would provide the background material necessary to prepare responses to the six questions 
posed in the request for advice.  At a three-day workshop held June 14–16, 2004 in Seattle, U.S.A, the 
background material was reviewed by the Study Group and answers to the six questions were formulated.   
 
This report is the result of the collaborative effort of the Study Group to collate scientific information in 
support of its responses to the above questions.  In addition to the Executive Summary, the report is 
organized by sections which contain the scientific information that was reviewed by the Study Group and 
used to prepare its advice.  Section 1 (Decadal-scale Climate Events) provides information on climate–
ocean indices and basin-scale events related to questions 1, 2, 4 and 5.  Section 2 (Coherent Regional 
Responses) summarizes the ecosystem responses to recent regime shifts in support of answers to 
questions 2 and 3 and discusses potential indicators (question 5).  Detailed descriptions of the observed 
regional responses to the 1998 basin-wide shift are provided in Appendices 1–5.  Section 3 (Implications 
for the Management of Marine Resources) outlines the conceptual framework for the provision of 
scientific advice and the development of resource management policy, given impacts of regime shifts on 
ecosystems and fish productivity (question 6).   
 
Regimes and Regime Shifts 
 
Around 1977, several zooplankton, invertebrate and fish populations throughout the North Pacific 
underwent a rapid (within a couple of years) change in distribution, productivity (particularly year class 
success) and abundance.  For many species the change was substantial and unexpected.  Most noteworthy 
was the fact that the changes, or shifts, observed in marine ecosystems were evident on such a large 
geographic scale, mainly the whole North Pacific, and that the changes were not short-lived, but in fact, 
persisted for a decade.  The post-1977 period is broadly characterized as a period of good fish 
productivity.  The co-occurrence of these shifts in ecosystems (across all trophic levels and including non-
exploited fish species) around the North Pacific suggested that the ecosystems were responding to a 
common factor, namely changes in climate or ocean conditions.  In fact, rapid and substantial shifts in 
climate and ocean systems, such as the Aleutian Low pressure system and sea surface temperatures and 
salinities, did occur around 1977.   
 
It was in the 1990s that this issue of rapid and substantial shifts in climate, ocean conditions and 
ecosystems became a hot topic of interest to marine scientists.  As a result, there has been much research 
on this topic, and climatologists, oceanographers, marine ecologists and fishery scientists have all 
contributed to the development of the concept of what are now commonly referred to as regimes and 
regime shifts.  A list of suggested reading on regime shift research is provided in Section 4. 
 
Though the concept of regimes and regime shifts is now a widely accepted paradigm in the marine 
sciences, a rigid definition of the term “regime” or “regime shift” has not yet been adopted.  A regime is a 
period of several sequential years (often a decade or more) in which the state, or characteristic behavior, 
of the climate, the ocean conditions or an ecosystem is steady.  It does not preclude year-to-year 
differences, but overall, the state of the system over the decades (i.e., decadal-scale) can be described as 
persistent, steady, or “locked in”.  A regime shift refers to a relatively rapid change (ocurring within a 
year or two) from one decadal-scale period of a persistent state (regime) to another decadal-scale period 
of a persistent state (regime).  As noted above, 1977 is a year in which the climate, ocean conditions and 
ecosystems of the North Pacific underwent a rapid and substantial shift which resulted in changes that 
persisted for a decade.  As such, 1977 is referred to as a regime shift year. The period from 1977–1988 is 
referred to as a regime.  In 1989, another regime shift occurred and a new regime period began. 
 
3 
Since ecosystems respond to changes in climate and ocean conditions (and not vice versa) and long-term 
data sets are available for climate and ocean factors, several climate and ocean indices have been 
developed and used to identify years in which regime shifts have occurred.  It should be noted that this 
had led many scientists to use the terms “climate regime” or “climate–ocean regime” when referring to 
regimes.  A widely used oceanographic index for the North Pacific is the Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
index (PDO) which tracks the dominant spatial pattern of twentieth century sea surface temperature 
variation across the North Pacific.  For example, one phase of the PDO represents an overall cooling in 
the central subarctic Pacific and a warming along the northeastern coastal areas, while the alternate phase 
characterizes an overall warming in the central region and a cooling in the northeastern region.  This east–
west pattern in PDO is referred to as the classic PDO mode.  Since 1989, a different pattern has emerged 
which is a north–south pattern.  This pattern is being referred to as the Victoria Mode since it was first 
characterized at a workshop in Victoria, Canada.  Other commonly used indices include the Aleutian Low 
Pressure Index (ALPI) and the North Pacific Index (NPI), both of which measure the intensity of the 
winter Aleutian Low pressure system, and the Arctic Oscillation index (AO) which is a measure of sea 
level pressure in the Arctic. 
 
Scientific literature reports that regime shifts occurred in 1925, 1947, 1977 and 1989.  Regime shifts are 
not confined to the last 100 years.  Paleo-ecological records show that regime shifts have occurred 
throughout the centuries but that the durations of detectable regimes have diminished from lengths of 50–
100 years to 20–30 years and even to 10 years in most recent history.  The identification of years in which 
a regime shift has occurred is often a topic of debate, since there are seasonal components to climate and 
ocean conditions, and the time it takes for biota to respond to changes in their environment is often lagged 
by a few years.  Another factor impeding the definitive identification of regime shift years is the lack of 
long-term data sets that span several decades or more.  Different studies employ different criteria for 
identifying regime shifts, but some common aspects include: 
 
• a synchronous and substantial change in the state of the climate and ocean conditions across a large 
geographic area, such as the whole basin of the North Pacific; as a result, changes would be evident in 
most climate and ocean indices; 
• synchronous changes in ocean conditions and biota at regional scales; as such, changes would be 
evident in most ecosystems; 
• changes in species’ productivity, abundance, or distribution evident in a large number of species, 
across all trophic levels.

Major Regions of the North Pacific 
 
The North Pacific can be divided into five major regions, or ecosystems: the central North Pacific which 
includes the transition zone and the Hawaiian Islands;  the California Current System from California up 
to northern Vancouver Island;  the Gulf of Alaska from northern Vancouver Island to the start of the 
Aleutian Islands, including the central Gulf region;  the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands;  the western 
North Pacific which includes the Sea of Okhotsk, the Tsushima Current region, Kuroshio/Oyashio 
Current region, the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea.

Response to the Request for Advice 
 
Q1. Has the North Pacific shifted to a different state or regime since the late 1980s? 
 
Yes, based on North Pacific climate and ocean indices, there were regime shifts in 1989 and in 1998.  
Not all North Pacific ecosystems have responded to the 1998 regime shift, however, there is growing 
evidence that most regional ecosystems have responded in varying degrees to this shift.  The 1998 regime 
shift had the greatest impact in the most southerly regions (i.e., the central North Pacific and the 
California Current System), less of an impact in the Gulf of Alaska, and little impact in the Bering Sea.  
 
 
Q2. What is the nature of the new state? 
 
Overall, the new regime since 1998 has a north–south pattern in variability.  For example, in the 
eastern North Pacific, surface waters have cooled in the southern regions, but this effect diminishes 
northward, and surface waters have continued to warm in the northernmost regions.  The dominant 
atmospheric pressure systems over the North Pacific (the Aleutian Low and the North Pacific High) 
have intensified which has resulted in greater upwelling-favorable winds along much of the western 
United States, and greater downwelling-favorable winds off Canada and southeast Alaska.  The 
opposite gradient has occurred in the western North Pacific.   
 
It is important to note that regimes are defined as decadal-scale (at least 10-year) periods, yet there are 
only 5 years of data available since 1998 with which to assess the new state.  In addition, an El Niño 
event in 2002–03 has complicated the characterization of the new state.  Some of the notable 
oceanographic responses to the 1998 regime shift include: 
 
Central North Pacific – warmer, thicker upper water layer 
• abrupt warming of surface waters 
• increased sea surface heights 
• deepening of the thermocline 
 
California Current System – return to less stratified, cooler conditions 
• cooling of coastal waters 
• enhanced southward transport of water and organisms 
• decreased stratification 
• deepening of the thermocline 
 
Gulf of Alaska – return to cooler, stormier conditions 
• increased storm intensity 
• deepening of mixed layer depth 
 
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands – no apparent regional response 
• continued increase in surface water temperatures 
• sea ice extent has continued to diminish 
 
Western North Pacific – pattern of responses opposite to the eastern North Pacific 
• harsher winter conditions in the Sea of Okhotsk 
• more sea ice in the Sea of Okhotsk 
• continued warming of surface waters in southern regions  
 
6 
Q3. What are the ecosystem responses? 
 
Not all North Pacific ecosystems have responded to the 1998 regime shift, however, there is growing 
evidence that most ecosystems are responding to this shift.  The 1998 regime shift had the greatest impact 
in the California Current System, less of an impact in the Gulf of Alaska, and virtually no impact in the 
Bering Sea.  In the southern region of the eastern North Pacific and in the northern region of the 
western North Pacific, biological production has improved.   
 
Ecosystem responses to regime shifts are most quickly detectable in lower trophic levels, such as 
phytoplankton, zooplankton and invertebrates because they reproduce quickly, which makes changes in 
their population abundance apparent shortly after a regime shift has occurred (usually within a year).  
However, because these species also respond to year-to-year environmental changes, several years are 
required in order to distinguish regime changes from interannual variation.  In fish populations, the 
response to regime shifts may not be immediately apparent since any changes in egg, larval or juvenile 
survival that affect population abundance will often not be measured until that year class is old enough to 
be caught in surveys or in fisheries.  This lag time can range from 2–3 years for fish such as Pacific 
herring or Pacific sardine, and up to 15 years for some rockfish species.  Surveys directed to larval or 
juvenile fish can be used to detect changes in fish populations sooner, but these types of surveys are not 
conducted in most regions. 
 
As with regional oceanographic conditions, the biota, or ecosystem communities, of different regions 
have different responses to regime shifts.  Specific ecosystem responses to the 1998 shift include: 
 
Central North Pacific – decreased productivity throughout the food web 
• northward shift in the low chlorophyll surface waters (Transition Zone Chlorophyll Front) 
• decrease in the survival of monk seal pups in the northern atolls of the Northwestern 
Hawaiian Islands   
• eastward shift in the summer albacore tuna troll fishing grounds from predominately oceanic 
waters to coastal waters, indicating a shift in tuna distribution   
 
California Current System – increased productivity  
• increase of phytoplankton biomass in both amount and seaward extent  
• increase in zooplankton biomass throughout the California Current System and a return of 
community composition to mid-1980 patterns 
• improved groundfish reproductive success since 1999 
• improved Pacific salmon marine survival since 1999   
• largest observed, since 1984, year class of Pacific hake in 1999 
 
Gulf of Alaska – increased productivity in some areas 
• increased primary production in British Columbia 
• increased Pacific salmon marine survival in British Columbia  
• increase in shrimp abundance in northern Gulf of Alaska in 1998–2001 
• strong year class of pollock, Pacific cod and sablefish in 1999 
 
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands – unchanged productivity conditions  
• no detected ecosystem response to the 1998 regime shift 
 
 
 
7 
Western North Pacific – variable productivity changes, with some increases in northern regions and no 
apparent responses in southern regions 
• increase in Sea of Okhotsk zooplankton biomass  
• evidence of changes in the near-surface fish community with Japanese sardine, previously a 
dominant species, being replaced by herring, capelin and Japanese anchovy   
• marked decrease in walleye pollock biomass in the Sea of Ohkotsk, but still remaining the 
most abundant species 
• no detected ecosystem response to the 1998 regime shift in the southern regions. 
 
 
Q4. How long can the shift be expected to last? 
 
Earlier regimes have lasted 20 or 30 years, but most recent regimes have lasted only about 10 years.  
Although one might reasonably expect the current regime to last a decade or more, it is currently not 
possible to reliably predict when a regime will end because we currently lack a good understanding of 
the mechanisms involved in regime shifts.     
 
 
Q5. Is it possible to predict when the regime will shift back, and what indicators should be used to 
determine when it happens? 
 
The phrase “shift back” implies that for climate, ocean systems and ecosystems there are only two 
possible states.  It is important to note that regimes are not characterized by only two possible states.  As 
such, a regime shift will not necessarily imply a shift back to a previously observed state.  It is currently 
not possible to reliably predict when a regime shift will occur because the multiple physical and 
ecological processes that cause regime shifts are presently not understood.  Research must continue to 
investigate the mechanisms and triggers for regime shifts.  However, it is possible to detect regime shifts 
soon (ca. 5 years) after they have occurred.   
 
Because they have proven to be reasonable indicators of past regime shifts, existing climate and ocean 
indices should continue to be used as indicators of changes in climate and North Pacific Ocean 
conditions.  Research must continue to develop and test new indicators such as sea surface height and 
ocean color from satellites.  These may be very reliable indicators because they integrate many processes 
of ecological importance (thermal structure, circulation, primary production), and satellite technology 
makes these fields consistently and regularly available.   
 
Monitoring programs to develop indices that are more directly related to the productivity of fish 
populations should be a high priority.  Research should continue on identifying the mechanisms by 
which climate change produces an ecosystem response.  This research is critical if we are to efficiently 
and quickly recognize the climate signals that cause shifts in marine populations that are of interest to 
resource managers.   
 
 
Q6. What are the implications for the management of marine resources? 
 
Including the effects of regime shifts in the management of marine resources is critical to sustaining their 
productivity.  There are numerous examples globally of the undesirable consequences of failing to detect 
or acknowledge climate impacts on fish populations.  Agencies need to develop policies with explicit 
decision rules and the subsequent actions to be taken when there are preliminary indications that a 
regime shift has occurred.  These decision rules need to be included in long-range policies and plans.  
8 
Stock assessment advice should indicate the potential consequences to stock viability of alternate 
management strategies under different levels of recruitment that would be expected in different regime 
periods.   
 
Ecosystem changes in response to natural disturbances provide opportunities for some species to persist 
when there is competition for limited resources.  In managed systems, where harvest is controlled, 
ecosystems will continue to shift and evolve in response to environmental disturbances.  The key 
responsibility for managers is to recognize that human exploitation may exacerbate the effects of these 
natural disturbances.  Managers should also recognize that the lifespan of species may have evolved in 
response to decadal patterns of variability.  Short-lived species are able to rapidly expand and re-colonize 
regions when favorable environmental conditions occur.  In contrast, long-lived species may rely on 
having several years to produce young, which allows their populations to endure long (decadal) periods of 
poor ocean conditions.  These survival strategies require different management responses.  
 
In the case of short-lived species that exhibit a short lag time in their recruitment responses to climate 
shifts, stock assessment scientists have a high probability of detecting the processes that influence 
production.  Assessment scientists must incorporate these processes into their assessment advice.  Stock 
projections can be conducted using best estimates of 5- to 10-year climate regimes to directly incorporate 
environmental forcing in advice to managers. Minimum stock size thresholds may be the best protection 
for short-lived species.  It might mean that there are prolonged periods when no directed harvest is 
possible. 
 
In the case of long-lived species, the response of the spawning stock biomass to regime shifts will be 
slower.  For these species, annual recruitment is only a fraction of the spawning stock biomass, and 
longevity ensures a relatively long reproductive cycle, enabling populations to endure prolonged periods 
of unfavorable environmental conditions.  In addition to minimum stock size thresholds, maintaining a 
diverse age-structure in spawning stock biomass should be a paramount management goal for long-lived, 
late-maturing species.  
 
 
Overall Recommendations 
 
Given the importance of regimes to ecological systems, we provide four recommendations for 
incorporating regime shift concepts into fishery management activities: 
 
1. accept the regime concept for marine ecosystems – a wealth of historical evidence suggests regime 
shifts are a natural and recurring part of marine ecosystems; 
2. develop and maintain a comprehensive observational program to monitor state changes in climate, 
ocean systems and ecosystems;  
3. develop climate indices to aid ecosystem monitoring efforts, and support research efforts into 
linking those climate indices to predictable parts of the climate system (e.g., variability in the El 
Niño Southern Oscillation);  
4. make use of integrated stock assessments, wherein various future regime scenarios can be evaluated 
to assess the vulnerabilities of fisheries and ecosystems, and to conduct risk analyses for different 
management strategies.

Summary 
 
Statistical analyses of Pacific Ocean and atmosphere fields for the twentieth century have revealed 
spatial patterns that remain steady for 10 or more years (regimes), then shift to another pattern within a 
few years (regime shifts).  The new pattern could be the “reverse” of the previous one (a phase change, 
where anomalously cool regions turn warm, warm regions become cool, etc.), or a totally new spatial 
pattern.  Thus North Pacific regime shifts project onto multiple spatial patterns, and in some cases are 
manifested as phase changes in these patterns. 
 
Around 1989, the atmospheric forcing of the North Pacific underwent a sharp change indicative of a shift 
to a new spatial pattern (not simply a phase change in a spatial pattern) from that which had dominated 
since 1977.  Anomalies in sea surface temperature evolved rapidly to a state with a spatial pattern that 
did not reflect the classic two-phase mode of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.  The new spatial pattern 
had a north–south distinction with sea surface temperatures remaining warm in the California Current 
System, but cooling in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea.  In 1998, this pattern changed phase and since 
then the dominant temperature pattern has featured moderately warm anomalies in the central and 
western regions, substantially cooler anomalies in the California Current, slightly warmer anomalies in 
the eastern Gulf of Alaska and extremely warm anomalies in the Bering Sea.  
 
The decadal-scale variability documented by ecosystem and climate observations is also found in paleo-
records, suggesting that regime shifts are a natural feature of North Pacific climate and marine ecology.  
Mechanisms for regime shifts are not known, and the statistical properties of observed climate indices 
can be reproduced by different models, each with different mechanistic assumptions.  Sudden shifts in 
atmospheric forcing are linked to rapid changes in upper ocean conditions.  The North Pacific climate 
forcing interacts with the dominant physical processes in each region, which leads to different regional 
responses in both ocean state and ecosystem structure.  
 
Forecasts of interdecadal North Pacific climate and associated ecosystem shifts are now impractical 
because we lack well-validated models and a mechanistic understanding for interdecadal climate 
variations.  However, given the importance of regimes to ecological systems, we provide four 
recommendations for incorporating regime shift concepts into fishery management activities: 
 
1. accept the regime concept for marine ecosystems – a wealth of historical evidence suggests 
regime shifts are a natural and recurring part of marine ecosystems; 
2. develop and maintain a comprehensive observational program to monitor state changes in 
climate, ocean systems and ecosystems;  
3. develop climate indices to aid ecosystem monitoring efforts, and support research efforts into 
linking those climate indices to predictable parts of the climate system (e.g., El Niño–La Niña 
Southern Oscillation);  
4. make use of integrated stock assessments, wherein various future regime scenarios can be 
evaluated to assess the vulnerabilities of fisheries and ecosystems, and to conduct risk analyses 
for different management strategies.

1.1 Introduction 
 
This section is organized as follows.  First, the 
recent physical conditions of the North Pacific are 
described.  We consider this to be the atmospheric 
forcing and ocean conditions since 1998, when a 
broad-scale climate regime shift in the North 
Pacific appears to have occurred (Schwing and 
Moore 2000; Bograd et al. 2000; Peterson and 
Schwing 2003; Bond et al. 2003).  Next, we 
describe changes over the past several decades 
(the reasonable course of available observational 
data), to place the recent state of the North Pacific 
in the context of historical temporal and spatial 
patterns related with their characteristic time 
scales.  A brief discussion of longer-term proxy 
climate records (e.g., sediment cores and tree 
rings) is also included.  From this large-scale 
description of decadal climate variability, we 
describe distinct aspects of decadal change in its 
major coastal ecosystem regions.  Finally, a 
discussion of potential mechanisms by which 
climate variability and regime shifts may occur is 
offered, both as a status report of our current level 
of understanding and to set the stage for future 
projections of the region’s climate state.  These are 
based on the body of climate research that includes 
a broad range of data analyses and a spectrum of 
simple to complex models. 
 
1.2 Basin-scale Patterns 
 
Present state of the North Pacific 
Because climate variability, including regime 
shifts, is due to global processes, the signals of this 
variability often have a coherent basin-wide 
pattern in the North Pacific.  In turn, regional and 
local coastal processes modulate larger-scale 
changes.  Regionally distinct surface (wind and 
heat fluxes) and buoyancy (freshwater inflow) 
forcing interact with topography to create regional 
differences in seasonal conditions, and in the 
timing, location, and strength of characteristic 
regional-scale processes and features such as 
fronts, upwelling plumes, and eddies.  Climate 
forcing interacts with each process differently, 
leading to unique regional responses in both ocean 
state and ecosystem structure.  We initially 
describe recent conditions in the greater North 
Pacific, and subsequently place regional 
differences in this context.  
 
In the mid-1970s, the Pacific climate shifted 
rapidly and dramatically, with the North Pacific 
becoming dominated by anomalously low sea 
level pressures (SLPs) (Fig. 1.1, top left panel).  
Changes in atmospheric conditions – principally 
surface fluxes of heat and momentum associated 
with the changes in the atmosphere – contributed 
to a pattern of unusually warm, upper-ocean 
temperatures throughout the northeastern Pacific, a 
pattern now recognized as the positive phase of the 
Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (Mantua et al. 
1997).  Around 1988, the atmospheric forcing of 
the North Pacific underwent another sharp change.  
The winter Aleutian Low pressure system 
switched to a weaker-than-normal state (positive 
anomaly).  However, atmospheric forcing 
maintained anomalously weak upwelling along the 
North American west coast.  Sea surface 
temperature (SST) anomalies evolved rapidly to a 
state that did not resemble the PDO SST pattern.  
SSTs remained warm along the west coast, but 
switched to cool anomalies in the Gulf of Alaska 
(GOA) and Bering Sea.  The Northwest Pacific 
reversed from a negative to positive SST anomaly.  
 
From 1999–2002, the dominant SST anomaly 
pattern in the North Pacific featured moderately 
warm anomalies in the central and western 
regions, extremely warm anomalies in the Bering 
Sea, and cooler than normal ocean conditions east 
of the dateline and north of about 40°N (Fig. 1.1, 
bottom panels).  SST anomalies in the eastern 
GOA were weakly positive during this period.  
This pattern of ocean temperature anomalies has 
been consistent throughout the upper 200 m of the 
water column.  Climate changes in 2002–03 
(likely linked to the 2002–03 tropical El Niño 
event) disrupted the SST anomaly pattern seen in 
the previous 4 years, yet this pattern remained 
relatively robust below the mixed layer (Fig. 1.2).  
As will be discussed later, the dominant pattern of 
SST variability in 1990–2002 was fundamentally 
different from the PDO pattern that captured much 
of the interdecadal SST variance from the 1950s 
through to the 1980s.

surface temperature (right side) for:  1972–76 (top panels), 1977–81 (second panels), 1990–97 (third 
panels), and 1999–2002 (bottom panels).  After the 1977 regime shift (second panels), the whole North 
Pacific was dominated by low sea level pressures (intense Aleutian Low) and warm surface temperatures 
throughout the Northeast Pacific.  The 1998 regime shift (bottom panels) has resulted in a 
reintensification of the Aleutian Low and the North Pacific High pressure systems and cooler waters in 
the eastern North Pacific.

bottom).  This subsurface temperature pattern has persisted into 2004 despite the disruption of similar 
surface temperature patterns due to the 2002–03 El Niño event. 
13 
Previous studies indicate that the upper ocean in 
the North Pacific is strongly coupled with 
atmospheric forcing (Polovina et al. 1994, 1995; 
Miller et al. 1994; Miller and Schneider 2000; 
Parrish et al. 2000; Huang and Liu 2001).  Thus it 
is no surprise that the atmosphere also has 
exhibited a distinct pattern since 1998 that differs 
dramatically from prior years (Peterson and 
Schwing 2003; Bond et al. 2003).  The dominant 
atmospheric forcing features over the North 
Pacific – the Aleutian Low and North Pacific High 
– were both intensified from the long-term mean 
(Fig. 1.1).  The surface wind stress pattern 
included intensified cyclonic (counter-clockwise) 
winds about the Low as well as anti-cyclonic 
winds about the High, and stronger-than-normal 
eastward stress across much of the central North 
Pacific.  From a coastal perspective, this resulted 
in greater upwelling-favorable winds along much 
of the western United States, and greater 
downwelling off western Canada and southeastern 
Alaska.  In addition to the local, direct influences 
on coastal conditions by wind-driven ocean 
processes like upwelling, this shift in large-scale 
atmospheric forcing contributes to changes in the 
magnitude and nature of the boundary currents 
(e.g., the California and Alaska Currents), 
including source water mass characteristics, the 
biological effectiveness of coastal upwelling, and 
the formation of biologically-important ocean 
features such as eddies. 
 
Sea surface height (SSH) 
From a basin-scale perspective, it appears that the 
dominant climate mode of the North Pacific 
changed in the late 1980s, leading to new ocean 
temperature and circulation anomaly patterns.  The 
physical organization of the upper ocean since 
1998 has had a relatively distinct character from 
the long-term mean.  This may be a first criterion 
for defining this period as a distinct climate 
regime.  Later in this section we will compare this 
pattern to conditions in the available observational 
record (50–100 years), and to the objectively 
determined modes of the North Pacific system 
over that historical time frame.  The relatively 
short duration of the instrumented record – relative 
to the multi-decade time scale of regime shifts – 
along with the present lack of a mechanistic 
understanding for decadal climate variations, will 
be shown below to be a limitation. 
 
Sea surface height (SSH) estimated with satellite 
altimetry is a useful indicator of temporal and 
spatial changes in large-scale ocean transport and 
vertical structure, especially changes in the depth 
of the thermocline, which may have important 
ecosystem implications.  While these satellite-
based series are short (1992 to the present), they 
provide a useful integration of the North Pacific 
variability.  In particular, the mid-latitudes 
experienced an abrupt warming, and deeper 
thermocline from 1999 through 2002 that appeared 
to be reversing in early 2004.  However, in the 
eastern and northern North Pacific a drop in SSH 
in 1999 has persisted through the present, 
suggesting a regime shift, although conditions may 
be returning to baseline levels in the eastern North 
Pacific.  Furthermore, regional differences show 
that while the 2002–03 El Niño was weak in the 
equatorial region, it was relatively strong in the 
eastern North Pacific.   
 
The leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) 
mode of SSH for the entire basin highlights the 
North Pacific clockwise circulation, and accounts 
for about 11% of the total variance.  This indicator 
identifies an abrupt increase in SSH in the central 
North Pacific in 1999 (Fig. 1.3).  This represents 
an increase in heat content, stratification, and 
depth of the top of the thermocline, and a likely 
increase in Kuroshio Extension transport and in 
the clockwise basin flow.  The change persisted 
for several years, but by 2004 conditions returned 
to baseline levels, perhaps reflecting the impact of 
the strong 1999 La Niña rather than a regime shift 
(Fig. 1.3). 
 
To capture important regional dynamics in SSH, 
the first SSH EOF is shown for four regions of the 
North Pacific (Fig. 1.4).  In the equatorial region, 
the first
 
SSH EOF captures 36% of the monthly 
SSH variation with a spatial dipole pattern where 
the eastern and western Pacific vary in an opposite 
manner (Fig. 1.4a).  This SSH EOF is basically an 
El Niño indicator but, because it is based on SSH 
rather than SST or atmospheric pressure, it better 
describes changes in vertical structure and 
geostrophic transport than the more traditional  
 
14 
indices.  During the strong 1997–98 El Niño, the 
SSH in the western tropical Pacific dropped by as 
much as 28 cm and in the eastern tropical Pacific, 
rose by 28 cm.  However, the 2002–03 El Niño 
had a much weaker impact on equatorial SSH. 
 
The next regional indicator, the first
 
SSH EOF 
from the mid-latitude region, defined as 20°–45°N 
latitude, captures 11% of the monthly SSH 
variation (Fig. 1.4b).  It is virtually identical to the 
first EOF for the entire basin (Fig. 1.3).   
 
The third regional indicator is the first
 
SSH EOF 
from the eastern North Pacific (20°–60°N latitude) 
and explains 28% of the monthly SSH variation 
(Fig. 1.4c).  This indicator shows a sharp and more 
persistent change in SSH in 1999, interrupted by 
the relatively strong mid-latitude 2002–03 El 
Niño. The drop in SSH in the California Current 
indicates a shoaling of the top of the thermocline.   
 
The fourth regional indicator is the first SSH EOF 
for the GOA and Bering Sea (north of 45°N 
latitude) and explains 21% of the monthly SSH 
variation (Fig. 1.4d).  SSH in this region declined 
more gradually than in the eastern North Pacific, 
beginning in 1999.  This was minimally impacted 
by the 2002–03 El Niño and persists through 2004. 
 
 
Fig. 1.3 First sea surface height (SSH) empirical orthogonal function (EOF) time series and spatial 
pattern for the North Pacific.  An abrupt change is evident in 1999 and characterizes a rise in SSH in the 
central North Pacific.  This rise represents an increase in heat content, an intensification in stratification 
and a deepening of the thermocline. 
15 
 
Fig. 1.4 First sea surface height (SSH) empirical orthogonal function (EOF) time series and spatial 
patterns for the North Pacific regions:  (a) equatorial, (b) mid-latitude, (c) eastern and California Current, 
and (d) northern, including the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea.  Following the 1998 regime shift, all 
regions exhibited a sharp change in SSH: the central and western mid-latitude North Pacific underwent a 
sharp rise; the eastern and northern North Pacific underwent a sharp decline.  The 2002–03 El Niño event 
disrupted these patterns in each of the four regions shown here, but only the mid-latitude North Pacific 
(panel b) has not returned to pre-El Niño conditions.  
 
16 
Comparing the first two EOF modes of SSH for 
the Northeast Pacific (25°–60°N, east of 160°W) 
details the recent evolution of the California and 
Alaska Currents (Fig. 1.5).  The first EOF shows 
the North Pacific and Alaska gyres changing out 
of phase over time.  In 1998, the northward Alaska 
Current and southward California Current both 
strengthened rapidly.  This reversed again during 
the 2002–03 El Niño.  The second SSH EOF 
indicates the entire coastal sea level rising rapidly 
during the 1997–98 El Niño, then declining 
steadily.  The implication of this indicator is that 
the California Current has been gradually 
increasing from 1999 until at least late 2002, while 
the Alaska Current declined during this period. 
Individual years since 1998 display significant 
interannual differences.  The most notable is the 
impact of the 2002–03 El Niño, which created 
warm anomalies in the upper mixed layer along 
most of the North American west coast.  However, 
this degree of interannual variability is typical for 
the instrumented record of the North Pacific, and 
is apparent within previously defined climate 
regimes.  There is some evidence that aspects of 
ecosystem structure are relatively insensitive to 
these year-to-year physical perturbations, 
compared to the apparent dramatic shifts 
associated with interdecadal regime shifts, 
although this remains an important interaction for 
further study.

Impact of atmospheric pressure systems on 
temperatures in the Northeast Pacific 
Much of the decadal variability in North Pacific 
Ocean conditions is explained by overlying wind 
patterns;  persistent winds over many years set up 
an ocean state that can shift within a year should 
the winds change.  The shift can be sudden, as 
observed in 1998–99, partly due to release of wind 
energy stored in the ocean and held in place by 
persistent winds.  The thermal and momentum 
inertia of the ocean can store energy from 
atmospheric shifts, in essence retaining a long 
memory of past climate changes.  In these ways, 
the extratropical North Pacific is coupled with, and 
shares, the features of the El Niño response of the 
equatorial Pacific Ocean.  
 
Figure 1.1 explains some of the recent unusual 
features of the North Pacific.  The left panels show 
persistent SLP anomalies in winter for a series of 
years, which represent the large-scale atmospheric 
forcing of the upper ocean; the right panels show 
the SST anomalies for the same periods.  The 
winds of 1972–76 represent the cold phase of the 
PDO, with cool winds blowing from the northwest 
or, more likely, weaker winds blowing from the 
southeast along the west coast of North America.  
These conditions cooled the waters along Line-P 
(a line of regularly occupied oceanographic 
stations from Juan de Fuca Strait to 50°N, 145°W, 
Figs. 1.6–1.7).  Stronger upwelling-favorable 
winds in summer contributed to cooler coastal 
temperatures (Fig. 1.1, top panels).  In addition, 
the effect of the 1972–73 El Niño did not extend 
far northward along the west coast, so this El Niño 
created barely a blip in Line-P temperatures.  
 
Following the 1976–77 El Niño, the winter 
Aleutian Low shifted to the warm phase of the 
PDO, which lasted almost to the end of the 1980s 
(Fig. 1.1, second panels).  The pressures of 1977–
81 winters display this pattern, almost the reverse 
of the cool phase that preceded it.  During this 
period the warm winter storm winds from the 
south were accelerated, warming waters along 
Line-P.  Tropical El Niño events often deepen the 
Aleutian Low further, increasing the winds even 
more.  For this reason, the warm phase of the PDO 
enhances El Niño warming in the GOA.  Weaker 
upwelling led to warm SST anomalies along the 
west coast. 
In the 1990s, a new atmospheric pattern 
developed, referred to here as the “Victoria” 
pattern.  SLP anomalies identify simultaneously a 
weak Aleutian Low and a weak North Pacific 
High, rather than the PDO pattern of a single SLP 
anomaly over the entire North Pacific.  The SST 
anomaly pattern was also different from the PDO 
pattern.  Weak upwelling winds resulted in warm 
coastal SSTs off the mainland United States.  
Upper ocean temperatures along Line-P were 
elevated while SSTs in the Bering Sea and GOA 
were slightly cooler than normal, possibly because 
of stronger northerly winds from the Arctic. 
 
Following the strong 1997–98 El Niño, North 
Pacific SLP anomalies reversed again.  The 
winters of 1999–2002 experienced higher than 
normal pressure in the North Pacific High (Fig. 1.1 
bottom panels).  Much of the GOA saw a deeper 
Aleutian Low, centered closer to the Aleutian 
Islands than in the previous cool phase.  This 
mode of circulation has been observed previously, 
but it was unusually strong in this period, and 
represents the positive phase of the Victoria 
pattern. 
 
The anomalous winds from the south and the 
effects of the 1997–98 El Niño contributed to 
warmer waters far to the north.  Along the North 
American west coast, sea level heights in this 
winter were at record levels, exceeding those of 
the 1982–83 El Niño.  Sea levels dropped within a 
few days at the end of February 1998 all along the 
Canadian and United States west coast, and did 
not return to the highs of the previous winter.  This 
quick response indicates that persistent winds 
build up pressure gradients in the ocean that can 
be quickly released as the anomalous winds die 
out. 
 
The west coast waters of North America shifted 
rapidly in late 1998, cooling dramatically as 
northerly winds led to extremely strong upwelling 
(Schwing and Moore 2000).  Open ocean 
upwelling during winter cooled waters in the 
GOA.  The waters likely flowed out, away from 
the center, and eventually sank below warmer 
waters in summer.  Crawford et al. (in press) have 
shown that in the winter and spring of 2002 the 
anomalously cold waters at 120 m depth between 
the North Pacific High and Aleutian Low flowed 
18 
almost due east, creating the record cold 
temperatures on deep coastal waters noted earlier.  
The large-scale impacts of this atmospheric pattern 
may have included a stronger North Pacific 
Current flowing toward the coast, suggested by 
SSH anomalies (Fig. 1.4b,c), which brought more 
subarctic water into the California and Alaska 
Currents. 
 
SST anomalies of the Victoria mode faded in 
2002–03, possibly in conjunction with the tropical 
El Niño, and North Pacific SLPs featured an 
anomalously intense Aleutian Low, a pattern that 
is associated with both El Niño winters and the 
warm phase of the PDO.  Anomalously strong 
winds from the south along the North American 
coast created warmer near-surface coastal waters, 
but this warming failed to penetrate below 100 m 
depth, leaving cold anomalies along Line-P at 100 
to 150 m below the surface. 
 
Climate indices 
Large-scale climate indices are useful integrators 
or proxies of environmental variability important 
to ecological conditions.  There are several climate 
indices that help identify the historical 
interdecadal variability of the North Pacific, and 
support the idea of abrupt climate shifts toward 
different states.  A fundamental conclusion from 
these indices is that no single index can adequately 
relate the complexities of climate variability in the 
diverse physical and ecological regions of the 
North Pacific.  This is particularly true when 
relating climate to marine populations and 
ecosystem structure, since physical–biological 
coupling is likely to be non-linear, and the 
biological response integrates many physical 
signals from a number of time and space scales 
and sources. 
 
The leading pattern of twentieth century North 
Pacific SST variability, the PDO, has exhibited 
significant interdecadal variations over the past 
century.  Minobe (1999) used wavelet analysis of 
the PDO index and an index for the Aleutian Low 
to identify enhanced spectral power at periods 
around 15–25 (~bidecadal) and 50–70 
(~pentadecadal) years.  The pentadecadal time 
scale was evident in both spring and winter PDO 
and Aleutian Low indices, and was suggested to 
provide the basic time scale for proposed PDO-
related regime shifts in North Pacific climate in 
the 1920s, 1940s, and 1970s. 
 
Figures 1.6 and 1.7 show how subsurface 
temperature anomalies at depth vary over time 
compared to three climate indices: the PDO, the 
Multivariate El Niño–Southern Oscillation 
(ENSO) Index (MEI) by Wolter and Timlin (1998) 
that describes El Niño and La Niña activity in the 
tropical Pacific, and the Northern Oscillation 
Index (NOI) by Schwing et al. (2002a) that 
captures aspects of both interannual and decadal 
variability in the extratropical Northeast Pacific.  
Figures 1.6a–c all reveal a shift in the late 1970s 
from a cold to warm regime.  The warm regime 
lasted until the late 1980s, with warming at depth 
beginning in the early 1970s, prior to the abrupt 
shift in SST.  The cold episode of the late 1980s is 
La Niña (Fig. 1.6c), and is followed about 2 years 
later by cold waters at 100–150 m depth along 
Line-P.  The PDO was cold throughout most of 
these 3 years.  Both the PDO and MEI shift to 
their cold phase after 1998, but the cold 
temperature anomalies along Line-P, which appear 
near the surface in 2001, take a few years to reach 
subsurface regions.  
 
Figure 1.7 illustrates temperature anomalies in the 
same manner along line-P, but for winter 
temperatures in the upper 100 m, and without the 
NOI.  In this case the MEI and PDO climate 
indices align in time with changes in Line-P 
temperatures.  Interestingly, the El Niño events of 
the 1970s had little impact on Line-P 
temperatures, likely due to the presence of a cold 
phase of the PDO.  The cold anomaly has persisted 
at 120 m in the 2003–04 winter. 
 
In summary, Figures 1.6 and 1.7 show that the 
upper 50 to 100 m of the ocean west of southern 
Vancouver Island respond quickly to El Niño and 
decadal changes, but cooling of subsurface water 
at 100–150 m follows La Niña events by 1 to 3 
years.  The mechanisms linking upper ocean 
temperature variability at Line-P with ENSO and 
PDO variability are presented later in this report.

Fig. 1.8 Principal component analysis of North Pacific winter (November–March) sea surface 
temperature (SST) fields north of 20°N, for 1950–2003.  The first empirical orthogonal function (EOF1) 
(top panel) corresponds to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) pattern and its time evolution is given 
by principal component 1 (PC1).  The evolution of the second empirical orthogonal function (EOF2) 
pattern shows large magnitudes since the 1990s, with a shift to large positive values for 1999–2002 (PC2)  
(from Bond et al. 2003).  The classic mode of the PDO (EOF1 and PC1) has two phases (positive and 
negative) of its east–west spatial pattern and has been the dominant classification of regimes until 1989.  
The second pattern (EOF2 and PC2) is a north–south spatial pattern that is referred to as the Victoria 
mode.  The 1989 regime shift was a shift to this spatial pattern, and the 1998 regime shift was a shift in 
the phase of this pattern. 
 
While atmosphere and ocean conditions in the 
California Current System (CCS) region since 
1998 have been similar to the cool, high biological 
productive state influenced by an anomalously 
strong North Pacific High prior to the mid-1970s 
(Peterson and Schwing 2003), physical conditions 
in the GOA, Bering Sea, and Sea of Okhotsk have 
remained in a state associated with the period after 
1977, dominated by an unusually strong Aleutian 
Low.  Bond et al. (2003) conducted a further 
analysis of winter North Pacific SST anomalies 
since 1950 and found the leading mode of SST to 
21 
have a spatial pattern agreeing with the PDO, and 
explaining the regime shift in the 1970s (Fig. 1.8).  
The second spatial pattern – referred to as the 
Victoria mode – captures much of the SST 
variability between 1990 and 2002, with a distinct 
phase shift in 1998–99 (Fig. 1.8).  The conclusion 
of this analysis is that abrupt climate shifts occur 
in the North Pacific, but they display more than 
one alternating spatial pattern (Figs. 1.8 and 1.9) 
and are too complex to be explained by a single 
climate index.  At a minimum, we should evaluate 
the PDO and Victoria modes of long-term SST 
variability in the North Pacific as independent 
sources of regime shifts.  They may have distinct 
mechanisms for their development, and different 
ecosystem impacts. 
 
1.3 Long Time Series in the North Pacific 
 
A limited number of locations in the North Pacific 
feature persistent and repeated sampling that allow 
multi-decadal time series of observations to be 
created.  These are vital in providing a long-term 
context of recent conditions. 
 
California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries 
Investigations (CalCOFI) 
The CalCOFI surveys of the CCS have been 
conducted since 1949, making it the longest and 
most complete multi-disciplinary ocean 
observational program in the world.  The CalCOFI 
data base is vital for documenting decadal changes 
in the physics, chemistry and biology of the CCS.  
Bograd and Lynn (2003) identified abrupt changes 
in water property and circulation patterns around 
1976 and 1998.  For example, the upper water 
column became sharply more stratified after the 
1976 regime shift, which reflected both an upper-
ocean warming and a deepening of the 
thermocline.
 
 
Fig. 1.9 Trajectory of the state of the North Pacific sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) in the 
phase space of the first two principal components, PC1 (abscissa) and PC2 (ordinate) from Figure 1.8.  
Labels showing years represent 5-year running means except at endpoints, which represent 3-year running 
means (from Bond et al. 2003).  Previous to 1988, the major shifts in the spatial patterns of SST were 
captured by PC1 (of Figure 1.8), but have since been best represented by PC2 (of Figure 1.8). 
22 
Water mass properties are influenced by seasonal, 
interannual, and episodic circulation events.  After 
1989, the upper water column off southern 
California experienced an enhanced stratification, 
reflecting a greater warming of near-surface 
waters (Fig. 1.10).  Stratification in 1999–2001 
was anomalously weak in the core of the 
California Current, and the Southern California 
Bight’s stratification weakened relative to the prior 
decade.  The upper water column has also been 
cool and fresh relative to the long-term mean for 
the California Current.  One explanation for this is 
a reduction in the transport of the Undercurrent 
beginning in 1998, resulting in more subarctic 
water in the Bight (Schwing et al. 2002b).  These 
regime shifts have also been noted in ecosystem 
organization and productivity (Roemmich and 
McGowan 1995; McGowan et al. 2003; 
Lavaniegos and Ohman 2003; Rau et al. 2003). 
 
Line-P 
Line-P is a set of oceanographic stations extending 
westward from the mouth of Juan de Fuca Strait to 
Ocean Station Papa in the mid-GOA at 50°N, 
145°W.  Regular oceanographic sampling began in 
1950 from Canadian Weatherships during their 
transits to and from Ocean Station Papa, and have 
been continued by Fisheries and Oceans Canada 
since the 1980s, following the termination of the 
Weathership program.  Three cruises per year take 
temperature, salinity, nutrient and biological 
samples along this line, from surface to at least 
1500 m depth.  The data set provides a unique 
opportunity to examine changes in water 
properties between ocean surface and deep waters 
over 1400 km of ocean in the eastern GOA.  It is 
the only such section in the entire Northeast 
Pacific Ocean north of California.  High-quality, 
frequent samples extend back to 1968.  Refer to 
Figures 1.6 and 1.7 for the variability along this 
line. 
 
GAK Line 
Long-term data on ocean hydrography are sparse 
in the northern GOA.  Only the GAK1 site (the 
innermost station on the Seward Line), located 
near the mouth of Resurrection Bay at 60°N, 
149°W and in the core of the Alaska Coastal 
Current (ACC) has good coverage, both 
interseasonally and long-term (1970 to the 
present).  Water column temperature and salinity 
in the northern GOA respond to seasonal changes 
in heat flux, freshwater input and winds. 
 
Substantial long-term variability in hydrography 
(both temperature and salinity) is present in the 
30-year GAK1 record (Figs. 3 and 4, Royer, in 
press).  Before the 1977 regime shift, temperatures 
were anomalously colder than normal at all depths 
(0–250 m) at GAK1 (Fig. 1.11).  After 1977, 
alternating periods of warm and cold temperature 
anomalies occurred, with warm events most 
evident at intermediate depths (50–150 m) in 
1977, the early and mid-1980s, 1987 and 1992.  
The largest warm event occurred in 1998, 
presumably a high-latitude manifestation of the 
strong 1997–98 El Niño.  The warming for all of 
these events, except the 1998 event, appeared to 
occur simultaneously at all depths.  The 1998 
warming was preceded by surface warming in 
1997.  The lack of sloping isotherms with time 
suggests that the warm or cool conditions are 
advected into the region, rather than locally forced 
by winds, runoff, heating and cooling (Royer, in 
press).  Sea surface temperatures were average or 
below average at GAK1 and along Line-P during 
1999–2002.  However, summer 2002 and winter 
2003 temperatures were above normal at GAK1 
and below average on Line-P (PICES, 2004).  A 
small, but significant, amount of the variance in 
the upper layer temperature signal occurred at the 
5-year period;  more of the deeper water variance 
occurred at this period.  Temperature at most 
depths was positively correlated with the PDO, 
which suggests that the PDO may be a useful 
index of GAK1 temperature throughout the water 
column, not just the SST (Royer, in press).  Deep 
(150 m) water temperature anomalies at GAK1 
reflect each of the ENSO events between 1977 and 
2000.  These responses to the El Niño are likely an 
alongshore (northward) displacement of the 
normal coastal temperature gradient.  GAK1 
temperatures at all depths were positively and 
significantly correlated with freshwater discharge 
1–3 months earlier (Royer, in press).

Fig. 1.10 Winter ocean stratification anomalies for the Southern Califorinia Bight region for 1990–97 
(top) and 1999–2001 (bottom).  Stratification is defined as the difference in temperature at 10 m and 
150 m.  Reference period is 1950–97.  After 1989, the upper water column experienced enhanced 
stratification due, in part, to greater warming in the near-surface layers.  Stratification in 1999–2001 was 
weak relative to the prior regime due to a cooler and fresher near-surface layer. 
Prior to 1977, surface salinity at GAK1 was high 
(Fig. 1.11).  This, coupled with lower surface 
water  temperatures, suggests that the waters of the 
ACC, and perhaps a larger region of the North 
Pacific subarctic were different from those 
observed after 1977.  After 1977, there were 
periods of alternating salty and fresh anomalies, 
with the most significant being more saline 
deepwater in 1985, and to a lesser extent in 1989–
90 and 1995.  As with temperature, salinity at 0–
100 m depth was significantly negatively 
correlated with freshwater discharge one month 
earlier (Royer, in press).  A trend towards a 
shallower mixed layer depth has been observed at 
Ocean Station Papa (Fig. 1.12), but not in the 
northern GOA at GAK1.

typically observed throughout the water column at GAK1.  The greatest changes in temperature and 
salinity occurred in 1977.

Paleoclimate reconstructions for the North 
Pacific 
Several studies have used environmental proxies 
to reconstruct pre-instrumental values for the PDO 
index.  One clear lesson from recent PDO 
reconstruction studies is that different proxy 
reconstructions yield different perspectives on past 
PDO behavior.  For example, five different PDO 
reconstructions – three based on tree rings from 
different sites in North and South America, and 
two based on corals from different sites in the 
tropical Pacific – have generally low cross-
correlations for the period 1840–1990 (see 
Gedalof et al. 2002).  Gedalof et al. (2002) used 
principal components analysis to identify the 
common signal in these five different proxies, and 
developed a new PDO reconstruction for 1840–
1990 that exhibited relatively large amplitude at 
periods close to 80 years, yet variable amplitude in 
periods of approximately 20 and 23 years.  A key 
result from this analysis suggests that the strength 
of PDO variations was weak throughout much of 
the nineteenth century, yet relatively strong 
(comparable to its twentieth century prominence) 
in the period from approxiamtely 1600–1750.  
 
Fluctuations in the biomass of the California 
sardine and northern anchovy off southern 
California have been estimated by scale deposition 
rates in sediments (Baumgartner et al. 1992). 
These paleorecords indicate these populations 
have varied on 50- to 100-year periods for the past 
1700 years.  The roughly 100-year oscillations of 
anchovy correspond with global climate cycles 
(Jiang et al. 2002), so they give a reasonable proxy 
of prehistoric regime shifts in the CCS.  
 
A relatively new perspective on the warm season 
SST history of the Northeast Pacific has been 
offered by Strom et al.’s (2004) analysis of 
geoduck growth increments from a collection site 
in Juan de Fuca Strait.  They demonstrate that 
annual growth rings in geoduck clam shells are 
well-correlated with observed annually averaged 
March–October SSTs in Juan de Fuca Strait over 
1921–98, and over much of the North Pacific in a 
pattern quite similar to the PDO pattern.  The 
geoduck-based SST reconstruction extends back to 
1840, and suggests that the 1990s were the 
warmest decade during that time.  
Finney et al. (2000) showed that the enrichment of 
15
N in Alaska lakebed sediments is a proxy for the 
abundance of spawning sockeye salmon in lake 
systems.  The 300-year 
15
N record showed 
substantial interdecadal variability, which 
corresponded relatively well with tree-ring based 
GOA SST reconstructions for 1700–1850, but 
poorly from 1850–1900.  These paleo-
reconstructions suggest that the relationship 
between interdecadal changes in Pacific Ocean 
SSTs and Alaska sockeye salmon production have 
been variable since about 1700.  
 
Finney et al. (2002) extended the lakebed 
15
N 
records and found both interdecadal and centennial 
scale variations from 300 BC to the present.  
Specifically, the sediment records had relatively 
high 
15
N concentrations from 300 BC to 100 BC, 
then very low 
15
N from 100 BC to 600 AD, with 
near-modern era 
15
N ranges of values from 1000 
AD to the present.  A comparison between this 
paleo-salmon record and the California sardine 
and anchovy reconstructions of Baumgartner et al. 
(1992) showed a relative lack of correspondence 
in variations over the past 2 millennia.  This 
situation contrasts with the historical record that 
has a relatively good correspondence between 
warm periods in the Northeast Pacific and high 
abundances of Alaska sockeye salmon and 
California sardines. 
 
1.4 Decadal Climate Variability in Ecological 
Regions of the North Pacific 
 
When applicable, we collectively describe regions 
whose recent conditions have been similar.  This 
may infer that these regions are dominated by 
similar physical processes, which may be a key in 
identifying regime shifts.  On the other hand, it is 
recognized that the large ecosystems described 
here may have strong regional differences in 
physical condition, which is reflected in distinctly 
different responses to long-term climate variability 
(Parrish et al. 1983; Schwing and Mendelssohn 
1997; Mendelssohn and Schwing 2002; 
Mendelssohn et al. 2003).  Thus, regime shifts 
may be more evident, and have greater ecological 
impacts, in certain North Pacific ecosystems, or 
even within certain areas within these ecosystems. 
 
26 
Central North Pacific 
The Transition Zone Chlorophyll Front (TZCF) 
which stretches zonally across the central North 
Pacific, separating subarctic and subtropical 
waters, is a biologically dynamic and productive 
region (Polovina et al. 2000, 2001, 2004).  
Cyclonic wind stress around the Aleutian Low 
creates a large region of open ocean upwelling 
(Ekman pumping) north of this zone, while North 
Pacific High winds lead to a downwelling-
favorable region to the south.  Southward Ekman 
surface transport results in the convergence of 
nutrient-rich subarctic water from the north, 
creating a distinct physical and biological front.  
The area north of about 40°N has been 
anomalously cool since 1998.  This is probably 
related to a deeper Aleutian Low, with stronger 
cyclonic winds and greater Ekman pumping and 
surface layer mixing, and much stronger westerly 
winds in the vicinity of the North Pacific Current.  
The winter TZCF has been situated farther north 
than usual since 1998 (Bograd et al. 2004).  
 
In contrast, the intensification of the North Pacific 
High and large-scale shifts in wind forcing in 
1998, which contributed to the shift toward cooler 
conditions along the North American west coast, 
also led to a warming of the central North Pacific 
due to reduced mixing of the upper ocean 
combined with enhanced downward displacement 
of the thermocline.  These have been identified as 
the main processes controlling mixed layer 
temperatures in the central North Pacific (Polovina 
et al. 1994, 1995; Miller et al. 1994; Parrish et al. 
2000; Huang and Liu 2001). 
 
California Current System 
The state of the CCS region is examined here with 
a brief review of SST, SSH, and Pacific Fisheries 
Environmental Laboratory upwelling indices.  The 
recent history of the CCS showed exceptionally 
warm SSTs, high SSHs, and anomalously weak 
upwelling (southward) winds in the southern half 
of the CCS from about 1992–98.  The 
anomalously warm coastal zone conditions were 
especially evident during the strong tropical El 
Niño episodes of 1991–92 and 1997–98.  A rapid 
shift to cooler-than-average SSTs in mid-1998 
initiated a 4-year period of cooler-than-average 
SSTs, and lowered nearshore and raised offshore 
SSHs.  From 1998 to the present, upwelling winds 
have been mostly above average for the region 
between 33°N and 42°N. Beginning in 2003, SSTs 
in the nearshore California Current have returned 
to levels typical of the 1980s and early 1990s, and 
the leading pattern of SSHs in the CCS region 
switched phases during the fall/winter period of 
2002–03, and switched phases again in mid-2003 
to the high onshore/low offshore SSH pattern.  
Because of the strong year-to-year variability in 
the CCS region, and the clear tendency for tropical 
ENSO events to influence conditions in the CCS, 
it is difficult to provide a near real-time separation 
of the interannual and decadal time-scale 
influences that are present. 
 
For the entire CCS, a period of especially warm 
SSTs began in the early 1990s and ended in 1998, 
while a period of relatively cool surface 
temperatures that began in 1998 was interrupted, 
or may have ended, in 2002 (Fig. 1.13).   
 
Upwelling winds were anomalously strong from 
the mid-1960s to mid-1970s from 33°–48°N, 
anomalously weak from the late 1970s to late 
1980s from 42°–48°N, anomalously weak in the 
early to mid-1990s at 36°–38°N, and then mostly 
very strong in the period from 1998–2004 from 
36°–42°N.  In contrast, upwelling winds were 
weaker than average during the winters of 2003 
and 2004 at 45°N and 48°N, indicating enhanced 
winter downwelling at those latitudes (Fig. 1.14). 
 
Gulf of Alaska 
Figure 1.15 shows maps of normal (or neutral) 
temperatures at the ocean surface and 100 m depth 
in summer and winter.  The warmest waters in this 
region lie beyond the continental shelf west of 
Vancouver Island, and the coldest waters are 
typically southeast of the Aleutian Islands of 
Alaska, near the middle of the Alaska Gyre.  In 
summer, the band of cooler water on the 
continental shelf adjacent to the west coast of 
Vancouver Island is part of the process of coastal 
upwelling, which brings deep cool water to the 
ocean surface nearshore when winds blow from 
the north or northwest.  Such winds are typical in 
summer all along the Canadian west coast, as well 
as the U.S. coast to the south.  Summers with 
stronger winds from the north will see cooler-than-
27 
normal surface, and even subsurface waters along 
the Canadian and U.S. west coasts. 
 
Cool waters in the northwest GOA are found in 
the center of the Alaskan Gyre, near 52°N, 152°W, 
which lies inside the Aleutian Low.  The cyclonic 
winter winds around the Low push ocean surface 
water away from mid-gyre and colder water 
upwells to take its place, lowering water 
temperatures even at depths of 100 m (Fig. 1.15).  
Winters with a stronger Aleutian Low will see 
even cooler temperatures in this region.  
 
Anomalies of ocean temperature at 10 and 120 m 
below surface (Fig. 1.16) are based on 
measurements by a conductivity-temperature-
depth (CTD) profiler on a research vessel, an 
autonomous Argo profiler, or by an expendable 
bathythermograph (XBT) deployed from ships.  
Near-surface (10-m depth) waters were cooler than 
normal in 2001 in the southeast Gulf, and 
somewhat warmer in the northeast. These 
anomalies weakened in summer 2002, and then 
reversed in summer 2003.  Conditions in the 
northwest in 2002 are not clear, due to lack of 
observations.  The warming of the southeast GOA 
supports the observations noted previously, that 
currents near the west coast carried more 
California Current waters at the ocean surface into 
Canadian waters in 2002 and early 2003.

subregions of the California Current System (CCS) (left panel).  Anomalies are in °C and are calculated 
with respect to 1982–2001 climatology.  Data are from 1° × 1° resolution using optimum interpolation 
(OI) of SST (Reynolds and Smith 1994).  A period of especially warm SSTs began in the early 1990s and 
ended in 1998.  In 1998, a period of relatively cool surface temperatures began.  The El Niño event of 
2002–03 interrupted this cool period, and SSTs have remained warmer since 2002.

Fig. 1.14 Observed anomalous coastal upwelling indices from 48°N to 33°N.  Left panel shows 6-year 
low-pass filtered monthly anomalies for 1946–2004, while the right panel shows the 9-month running 
mean values from 1990–2004.  Positive anomalies are associated with southward wind anomalies.  
Reference period is 1982–2001.  At all latitudes of the California Current, upwelling winds were strong 
from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s.  The 1977 regime shift corresponded to a shift of weak upwelling 
winds at the more northern latitudes (42°–48°N), but this shift was delayed at the more southern latitudes.  
At 36°–42°N latitudes upwelling winds have been very strong since 1998. 
 
Temperatures at 120 m depth show significant 
cooling in the southeast GOA from summer 2001 
to summer 2002, as noted along Line-P and off 
Oregon, earlier in this report.  The cold anomaly 
weakened somewhat but was still present in the 
summer of 2003.  The winter winds of 1999 to 
2002 are suspected to have formed this cold 
anomaly near the middle of the Alaskan Gyre, and 
the anomaly slowly deepened as it drifted 
southeastward, reducing temperatures along its 
path.  The waters from 100–150 m below surface 
are only weakly influenced by winter storm winds, 
so once a cold anomaly reaches this depth it may 
persist and spread out for several years.  During 
the winters of 2002–03 and 2003–04, this deep 
mixing was much reduced.  Currents at 10 m depth 
are more readily altered by changing wind 
patterns, and the ocean surface currents pattern of 
2002 to early 2003 likely warmed the surface 
waters of the southeast GOA during this period. 
 
The cold anomaly noted in the summer maps in 
Fig. 1.16 is still present through the following 
winter, the most recent season of observations 
available.  This layer of water at 120 m depth 
(actually from about 75–175 m depth, depending 
on location) was the coldest ever observed to hit 
the continental shelf of Vancouver Island to 
Oregon in 2002, and it is not surprising it has 
persisted almost another 2 years, and through the 
weak El Niño of 2002–03.

The warmest waters occur on the continental shelf off Vancouver Island (48°–50°N) and the Queen 
Charlotte Islands (52°–54°N).  The coldest waters are typically southeast of the Aleutian Islands, near the 
center of the Alaskan Gyre. 
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands 
Bering Sea climate is determined by the 
percentage of time that the cold, dry Arctic air 
mass to the north, or the moist, warm maritime air 
mass to the south are dominant in the region.  
Thus the physical and ecological properties of the 
Bering Sea are sensitive indicators for north–south 
shifts in climate properties (Hunt et al. 2002).  The 
region was strongly influenced by the 1977 regime 
shift in the North Pacific, as indicated by a 
deepening and strengthening of the Aleutian Low, 
which resulted in a transition from generally cold 
to warm conditions.  In the 1990s, there was an 
influence from the Arctic Oscillation (AO) which 
resulted in warmer springs and early ice retreat 
(Overland et al. 1999). 
 
With the exception of 1999, the southeast Bering 
Sea has been especially warm over the last 5 years.  
The warm air temperature anomalies often 
encountered in spring are now extending earlier 
into winter.  Sea ice is nearly non-existent south of 
58°N, the region of interest for Bering Sea 
fisheries.  Depth-averaged sea temperatures in 
summer, from a mooring at 70 m depth on the 
southeast shelf, were 1.5°C warmer in 2002 and 
2003 than during the mid-1990s.  What is 
particularly unusual about this recent period is that 
the warmer Bering Sea shows considerable year-
to-year persistence in many properties compared 
to earlier periods, and appears less coupled to 
large-scale teleconnection patterns such as the 
PDO and AO.  Bering Sea indicators should be 
watched closely over the next 5 years to confirm 
this shift.

size of the diamond represents the magnitude of the warm (red) or cold (blue) anomaly, according to the 
inset scale on each map.  The near-surface waters were cooler than normal in 2001 in the southeast region 
and warmer in the northeast region.  These anomalies weakened in the summer of 2002, and then reversed 
in 2003.  Temperatures at 120 m depth show significant cooling in the southeast Gulf of Alaska in 2001 
and 2002, with a weakening of this anomaly in 2003.

The Aleutian Islands are influenced by the 
Aleutian Low pressure system, but because they 
are co-located, the local response is very sensitive 
to the details in the Low’s position and magnitude.  
In particular, the climate of the western Aleutian 
Islands has a different character than the climate of 
the eastern part, with low correlations in surface 
air temperature (SAT) between the regions 
bounded by 170°W (Rodionov et al., in press).  
SAT variations in the eastern Aleutians are more 
closely associated with regime-like changes in the 
PDO phase similar to that in the GOA and the 
southeast Bering Sea.  The western Aleutians 
show more of a long-term linear trend toward 
colder winters and greater intraseasonal 
variability.  While it is not always the case, cold 
periods in the western Aleutians are largely 
associated with an increase in cyclonic activity 
over the Bering Sea (lower Aleutian Low 
pressures) and with southward advection of cold 
Siberian air behind the cold fronts of passing 
cyclones.  Thus 1998–2003 was a cold period, as 
the mean winter SLP averaged over the Bering Sea 
area was at its lowest since 1900.  However, the 
winters in 1996 and 1997 were anomalously 
warm.  In response to a decrease from a positive 
PDO phase in 1998, SAT in the eastern Aleutians 
decreased sharply.  This cold period lasted only 3 
years, 1998–2000, after which time temperatures 
returned to the values characteristic of the warm 
climate regime established since 1977. 
 
Western North Pacific 
EOF analysis of monthly-averaged air 
temperatures in the western North Pacific (25°–
50°N; 130°–160°E) identifies two dominant 
spatial patterns (Fig. 1.17).  The first pattern is 
represented by the first mode of the EOF1 
(explaining 38.6% of the variance) and is a spatial 
pattern with no distinct east–west or north–south 
oscillation.  However, the second mode of the 
EOF2 analysis (explaining 26.1% of the variance) 
has a distinct north–south spatial pattern.  Both 
sets of spatial patterns are important throughout 
the Northwest Pacific Ocean.  The first mode has a 
positive phase until 1955 when it switches to a 
negative phase, and in the late 1980s it switches 
back to an overall positive phase (Fig. 1.17).  The 
first mode also exhibits a close relationship with 
the PDO index pre-1955, and again after the late 
1980s (Fig. 1.18).  The second mode has no 
decadal-scale pattern over time (Fig. 1.17), but 
since the late 1990s has been in a positive phase 
corresponding to a north–south spatial pattern 
observed in the western North Pacific, with a 
continued warming trend in southern regions and a 
cooling trend in northern regions. 
 
1.5 Mechanisms  
 
It is essential to identify the sources and 
mechanisms of regime shifts if we are to truly 
understand their evolution and predictability, and 
eventually forecast their future impacts.  The exact 
mechanisms that control decadal variability in the 
North Pacific are not well understood. Miller and 
Schneider (2000) provide a comprehensive review 
of these mechanisms.  One difficulty is that only 
about 37% of the winter interannual variance of 
the Aleutian Low is on time scales greater than 5 
years (Overland et al. 1999), thus it is difficult to 
sort signal from noise in an analysis.  Yet shifts 
like the 1976–77 PDO phase change and other 
climate modes are often associated with large re-
organizations of regional ecosystems.  The main 
forcing for the entire North Pacific is the 
seasonally varying difference in heating near the 
equator and the pole.  As cold polar air flows 
south, it becomes unstable because of the rotating 
Earth, which creates major variations over a broad 
range of time and space scales.  The atmospheric 
flow is considered generally chaotic, in that 
weather predictions based on similar, but slightly 
different initial states, will rapidly diverge. 
 
At the simplest level, atmospheric variability can 
be modeled as a random process with energy at all 
time scales, so-called white noise.  The ocean is an 
integrator of the atmospheric signal so that the 
many atmospheric storms contribute to deepening 
the oceanic mixed layer.  The ocean also stores 
heat much more effectively than the atmosphere.  
This integration, or smoothing, of the high 
frequency signal, while not impacting the forcing 
by low frequencies, is referred to as red noise.  A 
red noise process – where the ocean integrates 
atmospheric forcing into regime-like patterns of 
variability – can result in time series that randomly 
produce features similar to decadal trends or 
regime-like behavior in the North Pacific (Pierce 
2001).

Even though a red noise model may explain North 
Pacific variability, it does not include the known 
complexity of the climate system.  There are many 
processes on different time scales that affect the 
North Pacific.  These include influences from the 
equator (ENSO), snow cover in Asia, changes in 
the Arctic, subsurface oceanographic temperature 
anomalies that advect around the Pacific basin 
with decadal time scales, and internal dynamics 
(e.g., Rossby waves).  An equally simple statistical 
model such as red noise is the “long-memory” 
model; this model is the equivalent of a 
combination of many red noise processes with 
different time scales (Percival et al. 2001).  A long 
memory process – wherein the ocean maintains 
information from many past atmospheric events – 
also produces records very similar to the regime-
like North Pacific variability.  
 
North Pacific variability can also be modeled as a 
true oscillation with a decadal (PDO) time scale.  
A series of papers by Minobe (1997, 1999, 2000) 
has identified a 50- to 70-year climate oscillation 
in observational records that interacts with 
bidecadal variability to explain the observed 
regime shifts in the 1920s, 1940s, and 1970s, and 
projected a new shift roughly around 1999.  Ware 
and Thomson (2000) have found that these 
oscillatory modes have occurred in the Northeast 
Pacific climate for at least the past 400 years.  
There is also observational and model evidence 
that internal ocean modes may set the time scale of 
regime shifts.  Latif and Barnett (1994, 1996) and 
Barnett et al. (1999) have modeled a 20-year 
coupled atmosphere–ocean oscillation that may be 
the driving force for the PDO.  This bidecadal 
oscillation has been identified in ocean 
observations (Schneider et al. 1999a, 1999b; 
Zhang and Liu 1999).  A shortcoming of these 
methods is the assumption that the properties of 
the PDO and other climate time series are 
consistent over time, while the reality is that 
climate signals appear to be non-stationary 
(Percival et al. 2001; Gedalof et al. 2002; Schwing 
et al. 2003). 
 
A recent study by Newman et al. (2003) 
demonstrates that the one-dimensional “re-
emergence” mechanism – whereby deep 
wintertime mixed layers can yield substantial 
memory in mid-latitude SSTs from one winter-
spring to the next – combined with random white 
noise and interannually energetic ENSO 
teleconnections, serves as a useful null hypothesis 
for the observed twentieth century behavior of the 
PDO.  This explanation for the PDO suggests that 
the mechanisms giving rise to the PDO are 
intimately tied to the mechanisms causing ENSO 
variability.  Furthermore, this model suggests that 
PDO predictability is limited to the combined 
predictability of ENSO and re-emergence physics.  
In this scenario, PDO predictability (and the 
ability to predict regime shifts) is limited to lead 
times of about 2 years.  
 
Alternative explanations for the observed 
twentieth century variability in the North Pacific 
have focused on deterministic coupled ocean–
atmosphere physics involving tropical-only, 
extratropical-only, and tropical-extratropical 
interactions; stochastic resonance, wherein random 
white noise forcing from the atmosphere, coupled 
with preferred modes of oceanographic variability, 
leads to enhanced oceanographic responses at 
preferred time scales; or externally forced 
excitation of ocean–atmosphere climate variations 
(solar forcing, lunar nodal tidal cycles, etc.).  It is 
impossible, based simply on the limited record of 
physical oceanographic data, to say which model – 
red noise, long memory, or oscillation – is better.  
They all can explain the North Pacific variability 
over the century of observational records; it would 
require almost 300 years of data to choose one 
over the other (Percival et al. 2002). 
 
What we learn from this review of mechanisms is 
that the regime shift concept – rapid shifts between 
regimes on decadal scales – is a reasonable 
conceptual model for the North Pacific.  The 
nature of regimes is due to a combination of 
intrinsic variability of the atmosphere and ocean, 
and forcing influences from other geographical 
areas (teleconnections).  Since the climate system 
is complex, occasionally chaotic, with untested 
mechanisms, and dominated by abrupt changes, 
prediction of the future state of the North Pacific is 
currently impractical.  However, given the 
importance of regimes to ecological systems, four 
approaches are suggested.  The first is the 
acceptance of the regime concept over a steady 
state view of ecosystems.  The second is the 
development and maintenance of a comprehensive 
34 
observational program to monitor and rapidly 
recognize state changes in ecosystems and the 
environment.  The third is the development of 
operationally useful indices which characterize 
climate signals that impact fishery populations and 
ecosystems, and the support of research efforts to 
link climate indices to predictable parts of the 
climate system (e.g., ENSO).  The fourth is the use 
of integrated assessments.  Here, various long-
memory climate and ecosystem scenarios can be 
projected into the future to assess the 
vulnerabilities of different ecosystems, risk 
assessments can be undertaken, and management 
strategies can be developed accordingly.

2.1 Introduction 
 
The Pacific basin-wide changes in climate and 
ocean parameters are reported in Section 1.  To 
describe specific regional responses to the basin-
wide changes, we divided the North Pacific into 
five major regions (Fig. 2.1):  the central North 
Pacific, which includes the transition zone and the 
Hawaiian Islands; the California Current System 
from California up to northern Vancouver Island; 
the Gulf of Alaska system from northern 
Vancouver Island to the start of the Aleutian 
Islands, including the central Gulf region;  the 
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands;  the western 
North Pacific, which includes the Sea of Okhotsk, 
the Tsushima Current region, the Kuroshio/ 
Oyashio Current region, the Yellow Sea and the 
East China Sea.  Regional responses were detected 
in physical oceanographic parameters such as 
temperature and salinity, and in organisms at both 
lower trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton, 
and invertebrates) and at higher trophic levels, 
including fishes and marine mammals.  Detailed 
descriptions of the observed regional responses to 
the 1998 basin-wide shift are provided in 
Appendices 1–5.

2.2 Central North Pacific (CNP) 
 
The central North Pacific experienced an abrupt 
change, beginning in 1999, characterized by a rise 
in sea surface height (SSH), indicating an increase 
in the depth of the top of the thermocline.  At the 
same time the eastern and northern boundaries of 
the North Pacific experienced a drop in SSH, 
indicating a shoaling of the depth of the top of the 
thermocline.  In the central North Pacific, the SSH 
rise was accompanied by a northward shift of low 
surface chlorophyll water.  At higher trophic 
levels, Hawaiian monk seal pup survival at 
northern atolls in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands 
dropped since 1999. Also, since 1999 the albacore 
fishing grounds for the U.S. troll fleet shifted 
eastward.  By 2003, the high SSH anomaly in the 
central North Pacific had dissipated, suggesting it 
was a response to the 1999 La Niña rather than a 
decadal shift.  
 
2.3 California Current System (CCS) 
 
Conditions in the California Current System are 
subject to decade-scale regime behavior with an 
overlay of episodic warm El Niño and cold La 
Niña events that last a year or two.  In the CCS, 
there have been strong ecosystem responses to the 
1977 and 1989 regime shifts.  The 1977 regime 
shift led to a protracted period of warm surface 
waters, with a deepening of the thermocline and 
the implication of lower productivity.  However, 
available zooplankton time series suggest that salp 
biomass declined after 1977, while euphausiid 
biomass remained unchanged and copepod 
biomass actually increased.  Following the 1977 
regime shift, overall recruitment improved for 
species such as Pacific sardine, and other species 
experienced intermittent very strong year classes 
(Pacific hake and Pacific cod).  After the 1989 
regime shift, the warm surface waters intensified 
and became unproductive for many coastal 
species.  In coastal waters, zooplankton shelf 
species were replaced by more southerly and 
oceanic species.  Many fish species (Pacific 
salmon, Pacific hake, Pacific cod, and rockfish 
species) experienced almost a decade of poor 
recruitment.  Southern migratory pelagics (Pacific 
sardines and Pacific hake) extended the northern 
limit of their distribution to northern British 
Columbia, and in some years, the Gulf of Alaska 
(GOA). 
 
After an intense El Niño in 1998, the CCS 
experienced a very cold La Niña in 1999.  Since 
1999, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have tended 
to return gradually toward warm conditions similar 
to those in the 1980s and early 1990s, but 
thermocline depths are now much shallower and 
nutrient levels are higher, generating higher 
primary and secondary production.  Beginning in 
1999, coastal waters saw a return of shelf 
zooplankton, and many coastal fish stocks 
experienced substantial improvements in year 
class success.  Some stocks produced good year 
classes in 1999 (e.g., Pacific hake), and recent 
returns of several salmon stocks have improved; 
Columbia River salmon runs have been 
extraordinary.  In addition, the distribution of 
migratory pelagic fishes (Pacific sardine and 
Pacific hake) contracted to a more southerly 
distribution.  There is growing evidence, based on 
a strong and diverse biological response, that a 
regime shift favoring coastal organisms occurred 
in 1998. 
 
2.4 Gulf of Alaska (GOA) 
 
Ecosystem responses to regime shifts in the GOA 
were strong after the 1977 shift, but weaker after 
the 1989 and 1998 shifts.  Variation in the strength 
of responses to climate shifts may be due to the 
geographical location of the GOA in relation to the 
spatial pattern of climate variability in the North 
Pacific.  Prior to 1989, climate forcing varied in an 
east–west pattern, and the GOA was exposed to 
extremes in this forcing.  After 1989, climate 
forcing varied in a north–south pattern, with the 
GOA acting as a transition zone between the 
extremes in this forcing.  The 1989 and 1998 
regime shifts did not, therefore, result in strong 
signals in the GOA. 
 
There were both physical and biological responses 
to all regime shifts in the GOA.  However, the 
primary reorganization of the GOA ecosystem 
occurred after the 1977 shift.  After 1977, the 
Aleutian Low intensified, resulting in a stronger 
Alaska current, warmer water temperatures, 
increased coastal rain and, therefore, increased 
water column stability.  The optimal stability 
39 
window hypothesis suggests that water column 
stability is the limiting factor for primary 
production in the GOA (Gargett 1997).  A 
doubling of zooplankton biomass between the 
1950s and 1960s, and in the 1980s, indicates that 
production was positively affected after the 1977 
regime shift (Brodeur and Ware 1992).  
Recruitment and survival of salmon and demersal 
fish species also improved after 1977.  Catches of 
Pacific salmon, recruitment of rockfish (Pacific 
ocean perch), and flatfish (arrowtooth flounder, 
halibut, and flathead sole) recruitment and 
biomass all increased.  There are indications that 
shrimp and forage fish, such as capelin, were 
negatively affected by the 1977 shift, as survey 
catches declined dramatically in the early 1980s 
(Anderson 2003).  The reduced availability of 
forage fish may have been related to the decline in 
marine mammal and seabird populations observed 
after the 1977 shift (Piatt and Anderson 1996).   
 
After 1989, water temperatures were cooler and 
more variable in the coastal GOA, suggesting that 
production may have been lower and more 
variable.  After 1989, British Columbia salmon 
catches and survival were low and herring 
declined in Queen Charlotte Islands (northern 
British Columbia).  However, salmon catches in 
Alaska remained high.  Groundfish biomass trends 
that began in the early 1980s continued, with 
increases in flatfish biomass.  By the late 1980s, 
arrowtooth flounder, rather than walleye pollock, 
were dominant.  Large groundfish biomass 
estimates resulted in negative recruit per spawning 
biomass anomalies of demersal fish. 
 
There is some indication that the GOA ecosystem 
may have responded weakly to the 1998 regime 
shift.  Increased storm intensity from 1999 to 2001 
resulted in a deeper mixed layer depth in the 
central GOA, and coastal temperatures were 
average or slightly below average.  After 1998, 
coho survival increased in British Columbia, 
shrimp catches increased in the northern GOA, 
and the 1999 year class of both walleye pollock 
and Pacific cod was strong in the northern GOA.  
Recruitment information from longer-lived species 
will be available in the near future, enabling 
scientists to determine if there were other 
responses to the 1998 climate shift.   
It is apparent that many components of the GOA 
ecosystem respond to decadal-scale variability in 
climate and ocean dynamics.  It is unknown if 
changes observed after the 1998 shift will persist 
in the GOA or how long the current conditions in 
the GOA will last.  Predicting regime shifts will be 
difficult until the mechanisms that cause the shifts 
are understood.  Monitoring indicator species is 
one method to improve our knowledge of the 
mechanisms that cause the shifts.  Potential 
indicator species of regime shifts would include 
those that have a short life-span, are sensitive to 
changes, are key trophic groups, and/or are 
targeted by fisheries which produce data that are 
readily available.  Examples of potential indicator 
species in the GOA that fit some of these criteria 
include sockeye and pink salmon, Pacific herring, 
juvenile fish abundance, ichthyoplankton, as well 
as zooplankton biomass and composition.   
 
2.5 Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands 
 
Bering Sea (BS) 
There is no evidence of a shift in the Bering Sea 
system since 1977.  The Bering Sea was subject to 
a change in the physical environment and an 
ecosystem response after 1977, a minor influence 
from shifts in Arctic atmospheric circulation in the 
early 1990s, and persistent warm conditions.  
 
A major transformation, or regime shift, of the 
Bering Sea occurred in atmospheric conditions 
around 1977, changing from a predominantly cold 
Arctic climate to a warmer subarctic maritime 
climate as part of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
(PDO).  This shift in physical forcing was 
accompanied by a major re-organization of the 
marine ecosystem on the Bering Sea shelf over the 
following decade.  Fisheries surveys and model 
calculations show a shift in the importance of 
pollock to the ecosystem, from near 10% of the 
energy flow at mid-trophic levels in the 1950s–
60s, to over 50% in the 1980s, although biological 
information for the earlier period is limited and 
often speculative.  Weather data beginning in the 
1910s, and proxy data (e.g., tree rings) back to 
1800, suggest that, except for a period in the 
1930s, the Bering Sea was generally cool before 
1977, with sufficient time for slow-growing, long-
lived, cold-adapted species to adjust.  Thus the last 
40 
few decades appear to be a transition period for 
the Bering Sea ecosystem.  
 
A specific Arctic influence on the Bering Sea 
began in the early 1990s, as a shift in polar vortex 
winds (the Arctic Oscillation – AO) reinforced the 
warm Bering Sea conditions, especially promoting 
an earlier timing of spring meltback of sea ice.  
Flatfish increased in the mid-1980s due to changes 
in larval advection, but the AO shift to weaker 
winds in the early 1990s reduced these favorable 
conditions for flatfish larval advection.  Warm 
conditions tend to favor pelagic over benthic 
components of the ecosystem.  Cold water species, 
i.e., Greenland turbot, Arctic cod, snow crab and a 
cold water amphipod, are no longer found in 
abundance in the southeast Bering Sea, and the 
range of Pacific walrus is moving northward.  
While it is difficult to show direct causality, the 
timing of the reduction in marine mammals 
suggests some loss of their traditional Arctic 
habitat.  Although ecological conditions appear to 
be mostly stable over the last decade, the warmest 
water column temperatures have occurred in 
2001–03 on the southeast Bering Sea shelf, despite 
considerable year-to-year variability in the AO and 
PDO.  
 
Overall climate change occurring in the Arctic, as 
indicated by warmer atmospheric and oceanic 
temperatures and loss of 15% of sea ice and tundra 
area over the previous two decades, is making the 
Bering Sea less sensitive to the intrinsic climate 
variability of the North Pacific.  Indeed, when the 
waters off the west coast of the continental United 
States shifted to cooler conditions after 1998, the 
subarctic did not change (Victoria pattern), in 
contrast to three earlier PDO shifts in the twentieth 
century.  Thus the Bering Sea will likely continue 
on its current warm trajectory, with biomes 
transitioning northward, allowing pollock a larger 
domain at the expense of cold- and ice-adapted 
species, rather than transitioning back to a cold 
regime. 
 
Aleutian Islands (AI) 
Climatic conditions vary between the east and 
west Aleutian Islands around 170°W:  to the west 
there is a long-term cooling trend in winter, while 
to the east, conditions change with the PDO.  This 
is also near the first major pass between the 
Pacific and Bering Seas for currents coming from 
the east.  Biological conditions in the Aleutian 
Islands have changed since the 1980s, and it is too 
soon to discern if there was a change associated 
with the 1998 shift.  Pollock and Atka mackerel do 
not appear to vary on a decadal scale.  However, 
the biomass of pollock appears to be higher now 
than it was in the 1980s.  Pacific ocean perch 
population dynamics vary on a decadal scale;  for 
example, Pacific ocean perch survival changed at 
approximate times of regime shifts, 1977 and 
1989.  There is not enough information on the 
early life history of Pacific ocean perch to define a 
mechanism for the observed variations.   
 
2.6 Western North Pacific (WNP) 
 
Physical and biological data were summarized by 
three main regions:  the Sea of Okhotsk; the 
Tsushima Current region and Kuroshio/Oyashio 
Current region; and the Yellow and East China 
Seas.  The response to the 1989 regime shift was 
strong in all regions of the western North Pacific, 
from the East China Sea through to the Sea of 
Okhotsk, including the Kuroshio/Oyashio Current 
region.  Winter air temperatures increased, which 
corresponded to warmer SSTs.  These conditions 
have persisted to 2003 and appear to be connected 
to the east–west dipole pattern observed in basin-
wide SST variability.  A strong response to the 
1998 regime shift was observed only in the Sea of 
Okhotsk, with an intensification of colder 
conditions and sea ice extent.  This intensification 
corresponded to a persistent increase in Sea of 
Okhotsk zooplankton biomass in 1999, 
particularly in the spring, for large-sized plankton 
such as euphausiids, amphipods, copepods, and 
arrow worms.  Changes in the epipelagic fish 
community were also evident, with Japanese 
sardine, previously a dominant species, replaced 
by herring, capelin and Japanese anchovy.  
Walleye pollock remained the most abundant 
species in the Sea of Ohkotsk, but the 
intensification of colder conditions in 1998 
corresponded to a decrease in walleye pollock 
biomass.  Consistent biological responses to the 
1998 shift were not evident in the other western 
North Pacific regions.  The biomass of warm 
water macro-algae in the Tsushima Current region 
increased when water temperatures increased in 
41 
the late 1990s.  Zooplankton biomass in the 
Kuroshio Current region has varied since 1978, 
but has remained at low levels.  Conversely, 
zooplankton biomass in the eastern Yellow Sea 
has remained at high levels since the late 1990s.  
Phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass has 
declined in the Bohai Sea, the western Yellow Sea, 
and the East China Sea since the early 1980s.  In 
both the Kuroshio and Tsushima Current areas, 
Japanese sardine began to decline in abundance 
around 1988.  In contrast, Japanese anchovy, jack 
mackerel and Japanese common squid have 
increased in abundance since the mid-1980s.  Most 
fish abundance and recruitment were normal in 
1998, but recruitment of Japanese common squid 
and Pacific saury were extremely poor. 
Groundfish species in the Yellow Sea have 
declined in abundance from the 1960s to 1990s.  
Japanese common squid have increased and 
maintained high levels since the 1990s. 
 
2.7 Coherence in Regional Responses to the 
1998 Regime Shift 
 
Although each region does not respond in the 
same manner to a regime shift, it is clear that 
regions do respond in some manner to most shifts.  
The 1998 regime shift had the greatest impact in 
the most southerly regions (i.e., the central North 
Pacific and the California Current System) and 
had virtually no impact in the Bering Sea.  It is 
important to note that the El Niño event in 2002–
03 has produced a signal that may have 
confounded characterization of the new state.  
Table 2.1 provides a summary of the basin-wide 
climate–ocean indices (Section 1), and the 
physical and biological components of each 
region, which are reported in detail in Appendices 
1–5.  The table is intended to provide a single 
source of summary information of all of the 
indices and time series that were reviewed by the 
Study Group.  For each data series, the overall 
state was characterized for regime periods to 
provide an indication of the nature of that climate, 
ocean or ecosystem component during previous 
regimes (1947–76; 1977–88; 1989–97).  In a 
similar manner, each year subsequent to 1998 was 
also categorized to provide an indication of which 
components changed, when those components 
changed, and the impact of the 2002–03 El Niño 
event. 
2.8 Climate Indicators for Detecting Regime 
Shifts 
 
A number of indices and indicators are used 
operationally to quantify climate state and 
variability.  These are derived principally from 
available long-term data and easy-to-monitor 
physical fields.  Some of the indices relevant to 
identifying decadal climate variability are 
described in Section 1.  For ecosystem variability, 
fishery-based and other biologically-based 
indicators should be used as well, although these 
are less developed.  Because they are proven 
reasonable indicators of past regime shifts, the 
existing climate indices (e.g., PDO, Victoria, 
Northern Oscillation Index) should continue to be 
tracked and used as indicators of changes in 
climate and North Pacific Ocean conditions.  
However, research should also continue on 
developing and testing the utility of new 
indicators.  
 
Decadal climate variability in the North Pacific is 
not a two-state system represented by a single 
mode (e.g., alternating cool/warm states), but is a 
result of more than one climate mode.  It is not 
plausible to predict when the system will go back 
to the previous phase of a mode such as the PDO, 
because it may switch to a different mode.  
Furthermore, it is not possible to say when the 
next change will occur, but only to detect if a 
change has occurred in accordance to some criteria 
of a regime shift.  The observational record is 
short relative to the time scale of regime shifts, so 
it is not certain if the modes observed this century 
are regular in timing and intensity.  Furthermore, it 
is possible that additional modes of climate 
variability have existed in the past, prior to 
instrumented monitoring, but within the 
evolutionary scope of fish populations, and 
perhaps new patterns will become dominant as a 
result of future natural and anthropogenic climate 
change. 
 
Existing indicators generally characterize basin-
scale patterns.  It is important to monitor physical 
changes at regional scales, and to use indices 
which represent fields or processes that directly 
affect fishery populations (e.g., coastal upwelling, 
circulation, stratification) rather than a broad-scale 
index that may be integrating a number of 
42 
different signals in different regions.  On the other 
hand, while the historical sequence of regime 
shifts requires multiple indicators to fully explain 
basin-scale variability, it is more likely that a 
single indicator will consistently describe regional 
climate shifts. 
 
Sea surface height and ocean color observed from 
satellites may be reliable regime indicators 
because they integrate many processes of 
ecological importance (thermal structure, 
circulation, primary production), and satellite 
technology makes these fields consistently and 
regularly available.  Monitoring to develop and 
maintain indices that are more directly and 
intimately related to the productivity of a fishery 
population or ecosystem should be a high priority 
because these types of indices will be consistent in 
explaining biological variability – as opposed to 
the common indicators currently available which 
are merely proxies of the biological changes we 
seek to track.  Finally, research should continue on 
identifying the mechanisms by which climate 
change leads to ecosystem response.  Such efforts 
are critical if we are to efficiently recognize the 
signals that will produce the shifts in marine 
populations of importance to managers.

3. Implications for the Management of Marine Resources

3.1 Introduction 
 
There has been much discussion recently on the 
need for ecosystem assessment and ecosystem-
based fisheries management (ESA 1998; FRCC 
1998; NMFS 1999; Brodziak and Link 2002; FAO 
2003; Garcia et al. 2003).  Often these two terms 
have been used interchangeably.  However, they 
do reflect different approaches.  Ecosystem 
assessment is relatively well defined and includes 
monitoring climate–ocean indices and indicator 
species to detect ecosystem changes, i.e., assessing 
the state of the environment.  It is important to 
note that fisheries agencies currently do not 
manage ecosystems, rather they manage the 
human impacts on ecosystems.  As such, 
ecosystem-based fisheries management reflects the 
incorporation of knowledge of the state of the 
ecosystem (i.e., the ecosystem assessment) into 
single species assessments when making 
management decisions.  This approach has 
recently been referred to as Ecosystem 
Approaches to Fisheries (FAO 2003; Browman 
and Stergiou 2004).  It is an approach that 
explicitly accounts for ecosystem processes when 
formulating management actions which may still 
encompass traditional management tools, such as 
total allowable catch, but which will likely be 
different quantitatively as a result of taking 
account of more factors (Sissenwine and 
Murawski 2004). Ecosystem-based fisheries 
management provides a framework for managing 
marine resources that can consider climate regimes 
and regime shift impacts on marine ecosystems.   
 
Agencies charged with fisheries management 
should develop policies immediately which will 
explicitly specify decision rules and subsequent 
actions to be taken in response to preliminary 
indications that a regime shift has occurred.  These 
decision rules need to be included in long-range 
policies and plans.  Management actions should 
consider the life history of the species of interest, 
and can encompass varying response times, 
depending on the species’ lifespan and rate of 
production.  The provision of stock assessment 
advice needs to indicate explicitly the likely 
consequences of alternate harvest strategies to 
stock viability, under various recruitment 
assumptions.   
 
3.2 Response Time of Biota to Regime Shifts 
 
Marine organisms have evolved life history 
strategies to cope with variability in their 
environment.  These life history strategies range 
from short-lived, highly variable stock dynamics, 
which respond immediately to changes in their 
environment, to extremely long-lived species 
whose population dynamics are mainly stable 
(King and McFarlane 2003). 
   
Short-lived species have a shorter generation time 
which helps to maximize their intrinsic rate of 
population growth, despite typically having 
relatively low fecundity.  Longevity allows a 
species to persist through prolonged periods of 
poor productivity (Leaman and Beamish 1984; 
McFarlane and Beamish 1986).  Long-lived 
species are typically highly fecund, which allows 
them to take immediate advantage of changes to 
more productive regimes, through increased year 
class success.  It is important to note that the 
intrinsic rate of population growth in long-lived 
species is lower than in short-lived species, so 
improved year class success translates into delayed 
increases in population productivity. 
 
3.3 Response Time of Management to 
Regime Shifts 
 
Since most fisheries are conducted on mature fish, 
the age of recruitment to the fishery typically 
corresponds to the age of maturity.  It is possible 
to use the age of maturity as an indication of how 
long fisheries managers have to respond to a shift 
52 
in productivity.  For example, Pacific cod matures 
and recruits to the fishery at age 2+.  A shift in 
productivity, reflected in year class success, would 
have impacts on the available biomass within 3 
years, i.e., this is when a strong year class will 
appear as a large increase in biomass for the 
fishery.  Conversely, a large year class in a 
rockfish species would not appear as an increase in 
biomass to the fishery for 8–10 years (depending 
on the species).  The response time of 
management actions to regime shifts may be 
lagged by a correspondence to the age of 
recruitment of the species of interest. 
 
3.4 Provision of Stock Assessment Advice 
 
Fisheries agencies need to direct fisheries 
scientists to provide harvest recommendations that 
reflect a range of risk (low to high) to the stock 
under different assumptions of productivity or 
recruitment (e.g., low, medium and high year class 
success).  Different levels of productivity appear 
to be decadal in nature, corresponding to different 
regimes, with changes in productivity 
corresponding to regime shifts (Beamish and 
Bouillon 1993; Francis and Hare 1994; McFarlane 
et al. 2000; Hare and Mantua 2000; Hollowed et 
al. 2001).  Stock assessment scientists should also 
provide managers with an indication of the most 
probable productivity level for that particular 
regime.  Managers can make decisions on harvest 
levels using ancillary information (ecosystem 
assessments, climate–ocean indices, indicator 
species) to select the most likely productivity 
assumption.  It is important to note that scientific 
advice will remain only one of the myriad of 
factors that managers use to make decisions.  
Managers will need to consider economic, 
political and social factors when selecting the 
appropriate level of risk to the stock that they are 
willing to accept, and select harvest rates 
accordingly.   
 
Polovina (2004) reviewed numerous studies that 
investigate optimum harvest rates for fisheries that 
are impacted by regime shifts.  In some studies, a 
constant harvest rate strategy generally performed 
well (Walters and Parma 1996; DiNardo and 
Wetherall 1999).  Polovina (2004) suggested that a 
constant harvest rate strategy, when applicable, 
should employ a rate well below traditional 
benchmarks.  However, the preferred strategy is a 
regime-specific harvest rate (Spencer 1997; 
Peterman et al. 2000; MacCall 2002).  For 
example, a population simulation model of Pacific 
sardine (Sardinops sagax), using a regime-specific 
harvest rate strategy, produced higher average 
annual yields and lower variability in spawning 
biomass than a constant harvest rate strategy 
(MacCall 2002; Polovina 2004).  Improved results 
could still be achieved even if the switch in 
harvest rates was delayed some years after the 
regime shift.  However, it should be noted that the 
simulation assumed regime periods of a known 
duration, which is not applicable for the current 
state of knowledge.   
 
In the case of short-lived species that exhibit 
highly autocorrelated recruitment responses to 
climate shifts, stock assessment scientists have a 
high probability of detecting the processes or 
indices that influence production.  Assessment 
scientists should be directed to incorporate these 
processes into their assessment advice.  When 
providing advice to managers, stock projections 
can be conducted, using best estimates of 5- to 10-
year climate regimes, to directly incorporate 
environmental forcing.  It should be noted that 
preservation of spawning stock biomass at levels 
consistent with maximum sustainable yield (MSY) 
for a productive period will probably be 
impossible when the stock shifts to a less 
productive regime.  Minimum stock size 
thresholds may be the best protection for species 
with this type of life history strategy.  Imposing 
this type of stock protection will likely result in 
prolonged periods of no directed harvest during 
unfavorable regimes.  
 
In the case of long-lived species, the response of 
the spawning stock biomass to regime shifts will 
be slower or lagged by the age of recruitment to 
the regime shift year.  For these species, annual 
recruitment is only a fraction of the spawning 
stock biomass, and longevity ensures a relatively 
long reproductive cycle, enabling populations to 
endure prolonged periods of unfavorable 
environmental conditions.  Maintaining an 
appropriate age-structure in spawning stock 
biomass should be a paramount management goal 
for long-lived, late-maturing species. 
 
53 
In all cases, it is important to maintain a critical 
spawning biomass.  This is a level which ensures 
that the population is able to withstand long 
periods of poor environmental conditions.  It does 
imply that exploitation levels may be severely 
reduced, or in some cases, that no fishing could 
occur during prolonged periods of poor 
recruitment. 
 
3.5 Decision Rules 
 
Agencies need to develop policies which explicitly 
specify decision rules and subsequent actions to be 
taken in response to preliminary indications that a 
regime shift has occurred.  These decision rules 
need to be included in long-range policies and 
plans.  Stock assessment advice should provide an 
indication of the likely consequences of alternate 
harvest strategies, under various recruitment 
assumptions, to stock viability.  Decision rules 
must reflect the need to always maintain a critical 
spawning biomass and a robust age composition.  
The most appropriate approach to managing 
fisheries, given regime shift impacts, is to apply 
regime-specific harvest rates.  These harvest rates 
should be part of the decision rule framework, and 
should be associated with timeframes for 
management response triggered when there are 
indications that a regime shift has occurred.  As 
discussed above, the response time (i.e., changes 
in harvest rates) can be lagged to correspond to the 
species-specific biological rates (i.e., age of 
recruitment) and still enable higher average annual 
yields and lower variability in spawning biomass.  
If the regime shift corresponds to an increase in 
productivity, then delaying the change in harvest 
rate (from low to high) would allow the population 
to rapidly increase, resulting in increased recruits 
under the spawner-recruit relationship of the more 
productive regime (Polovina 2004).  If the regime 
shift corresponds to a decrease in productivity, 
then delaying the change in harvest rate (from high 
to low) and the fishing down of the population will 
not reduce recruitment under the spawner-recruit 
relationship of a less productive regime (Polovina 
2004).  The caveat for delaying a switch from high 
to low harvest rates in less productive regimes is 
that aggressive harvest rates could result in a 
population level that is at, or near, the critical 
spawning biomass, which could translate into a 
prolonged period of no fishing.  To address this, 
managers could also consider a provisional step-
wise approach to changing harvest rates with 
regime shifts until the productivity level of a new 
regime has been verified.

Appendix 1:  Recent Ecosystem Changes in the Central North Pacific  
 
Lead Author:  Jeffrey Polovina 
 
Contributing Author:  Evan Howell  
 
 
Summary 
 
The central North Pacific experienced an abrupt change beginning in 1999, characterized by a rise in sea 
surface height (SSH), indicating an increase in the depth of the top of the thermocline.  At the same time, 
the eastern and northern boundaries of the North Pacific experienced a drop in SSH, indicating a 
shoaling of the depth of the top of the thermocline.  In the central North Pacific, the SSH rise was 
accompanied by a northward shift of low surface chlorophyll water.  At higher trophic levels, Hawaiian 
monk seal pup survival at northern atolls in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands has dropped since 1999.  
Also, since 1999 the albacore fishing grounds for the U.S. troll fleet has shifted eastward.  By 2003, the 
high SSH in the central North Pacific dissipated, suggesting it was a response to the 1999 La Niña rather 
than a decadal shift. 
 
 
A1.1 Introduction 
 
In this section we will examine changes in the 
central North Pacific ecosystem primarily since 
1999, based on a range of data, including satellite 
altimetry and satellite ocean color, Northwestern 
Hawaiian Islands monk seal pup survival, and 
spatial distribution of the troll fishing grounds for 
albacore.  However, it should be noted as 
background that earlier changes have been 
documented.  Physical and biological changes 
have been described in the central North Pacific 
over the period 1960 to the early 1990s.  The 
winter and spring mixed layer depth in the central 
Transition Zone and northern Subtropical Gyre 
was 30–80% greater during 1977–88 than during 
1960–76, based on vertical temperature records 
(Polovina et al. 1995).  A simulation model 
indicated that the deeper mixed layer would bring 
deep nutrients into the euphotic zone and increase 
phytoplanton biomass in this region (Polovina et 
al. 1995).  Since the late 1980s, coincident with 
the 1989 regime shift noticed elsewhere in the 
North Pacific, there has been a drop in 
productivity, perhaps a return to pre-1977 levels, 
of a number of marine ecosystem components of 
the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, including 
spiny lobster, sea birds, and monk seals (Polovina 
et al. 1994; Polovina and Haight 1999). 
 
A1.2 Physical Oceanography 
 
Sea surface height 
Time series of empirical orthogonal functions 
(EOFs) derived from sea surface height (SSH) 
estimated with satellite altimetry provide 
indicators which describe temporal and spatial 
changes in geostrophic transport and the ocean 
vertical structure, especially changes in the depth 
of the top of thermocline, which may have 
important ecosystem implications.  In order to 
capture important regional dynamics in SSH 
changes, we partition the North Pacific into four 
regions and compute the first SSH EOF for each 
region (Figs. A1.1a–d; Polovina and Howell, in 
press).  In the equatorial regions, the first
 
SSH 
EOF captures 36% of the monthly SSH variation, 
with a spatial dipole pattern where the eastern and 
western Pacific vary in an opposite manner (Fig. 
A1.1a).  During the strong 1997–98 El Niño, the 
SSH in the western Pacific dropped by as much as 
28 cm and in the eastern North Pacific rose by 28 
cm (Fig. A1.1a).  This indicator shows the 2002–
03 El Niño had a much weaker impact on 
equatorial SSH than the 1997–98 event (Fig. 
A1.1a).  This SSH EOF is basically an El Niño 
indicator, but because it is based on SSH rather 
than SST or atmospheric pressure, it better 
describes changes in vertical structure and 
geostrophic transport than the more traditional 
indices.  
60

equatorial Pacific, (b) the central North Pacific, (c) the eastern Pacific, and (d) the Alaskan Gyre.  The 
weighting functions are presented as time series in the left panels and the corresponding spatial patterns 
are in the right panels, with the annotation on the time series representing the variance explained for the 
mode of each region. 
 
61
The next regional indicator is the first SSH EOF 
from the mid-latitude region, defined as 20°–45°N 
latitude, and it captures 11% of the monthly SSH 
variation.  This indicator identifies an abrupt 
change in SSH which occurred in 1999, 
characterized by SSH rising in the central North 
Pacific (Fig. A1.1b).  This increase in SSH 
represents an increase in heat content, 
stratification, and depth of the top of the 
thermocline.  The change persisted for several 
years, but by 2004, conditions returned back to 
baseline levels, thus probably reflecting the impact 
of the strong 1999 La Niña rather than a regime 
shift (Fig. A1.1b).   
 
The third regional indicator is the first
 
SSH EOF 
from the eastern North Pacific, 20°–60°N latitude, 
and explains 28% of the monthly SSH variation.  
This indicator shows a sharp and more persistent 
drop in SSH in 1999, interrupted by the relatively 
strong mid-latitude 2002–03 El Niño (Fig. A1.1c).  
The drop in SSH indicates a shoaling of the top of 
the thermocline.   
 
The fourth regional indicator is the first SSH EOF 
for the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea, north of 
45°N latitude, and explains 20% of the monthly 
SSH variation.  This indicator finds that a drop in 
SSH developed more gradually than in the eastern 
North Pacific, beginning in 1999, and persists 
through 2004 with minimal impact from the 2002–
03 El Niño (Fig. A1.1d).   
 
These four regional EOFs distill over a decade of 
SSH data in the North Pacific to identify some 
major spatial and temporal patterns of ocean 
dynamics in the North Pacific.  In particular, the 
mid-latitudes experienced an abrupt warming and 
deeper thermocline from 1999 through 2002 and 
now, in early 2004, conditions appear to be 
reversing.  However, in the eastern and northern 
North Pacific a drop is SSH was experienced in 
1999 which persists through the present, although 
conditions may be returning to baseline levels in 
the eastern North Pacific.  Furthermore, these 
regional indicators show that while the 2002–03 El 
Niño was weak in the equatorial region, it was 
relatively strong in the eastern North Pacific.  
A1.3 Lower Trophic Levels 
 
Surface chlorophyll  
Satellite imagery of surface chlorophyll a in the 
North Pacific shows two distinct regions: a region 
of relatively low surface chlorophyll representing 
the warm, vertically stratified subtropical gyre, 
and to the north, a region of relatively high surface 
chlorophyll representing the Transition Zone and 
subarctic gyre.  The boundary between these two 
regions is termed the Transition Zone Chlorophyll 
Front (TZCF) and is an important migration and 
forage habitat for large pelagic species (Polovina 
et al. 2001; Fig. A1.2a).  Contouring the 
0.2 mg m
–3
 surface chlorophyll a level from 
SeaWiFS ocean color satellite imagery provides an 
excellent indicator of the position of the TZCF 
(Polovina et al. 2001). Satellite ocean color data 
have shown that the position of TZCF migrates 
seasonally north and south about 1,000 km.  In the 
summer, as the central North Pacific warms and 
becomes more stratified, the TZCF typically shifts 
northward to the 40°–45°N latitude region, while 
in the winter, as storm tracks shift southward and 
vertically mix the central North Pacific, the TZCF 
moves southward to about 28°–32°N latitude 
(Polovina et al. 2001).  However, there is 
considerable interannual variability in the winter 
position of the TZCF.  In years when SSH in the 
central North Pacific was anomalously high, 
indicating anomalously warm and vertically 
stratified conditions (1999–2002, Fig. A1.1b), the 
winter position of the TZCF between 150°–180°W 
longitude is shifted northward (Fig. A1.2b).  The 
winter position of the TZCF gives one measure of 
the northern boundary of the subtropical gyre, so 
that tracking this feature over time provides an 
indicator of large-scale atmosphere and ocean 
changes.  The winter position of the TZCF also 
has regional impacts.  In years when the TZCF is 
shifted southward (1997, 1998, 2003), it impinges 
on the northern atolls of the Northwestern 
Hawaiian Islands, while in other years its winter 
position lies hundreds of kilometers north of these 
atolls (Fig. A1.2b).  The monthly time series of 
surface chlorophyll for the region around the 
northern atolls shows high values in 1997, 1998, 
and 2003, as a result of a southward-shifted TZCF 
 
62

Front for January and February plotted by year for the central North Pacific.  
 
(Fig. A1.3a).  In winters when the TZCF impinges 
on the northern atolls, the monk seal habitat is 
characterized by higher chlorophyll, vertically 
mixed cooler water, and a convergent front which 
appears to support a variety of large pelagics 
including squids, tunas, and turtles.  However, in 
winters when the TZCF is well north of the atolls, 
their habitat consists of strong, vertically stratified, 
low chlorophyll warm water and no productive 
front.  These different oceanographic conditions 
may have higher trophic level impacts.  For 
example, Hawaiian monk seal survival rates for 
pups born on Pearl and Hermes Atoll, and Midway 
Atoll, appear to respond to these different 
oceanographic conditions.  During 1999–2002 
when the TZCF is north of the atolls, indicated by 
low chlorophyll values, pup survival declined, 
with some time lag, and since 2003 when the 
TZCF shifted southward, an increase in survival is 
suggested (Fig. A1.3).  Preliminary evidence 
suggests that in winters when the TZCF impinges 
on the northern atolls, the monk seals at these 
atolls are fatter and likely have higher survival 
rates than in winters when the TZCF is shifted 
north of the atolls (Antonelis et al. 2003). 
 
A1.4 Invertebrates 
 
A preliminary stock assessment for spiny lobster 
(Panulirus marginatus) in the Northwestern 
Hawaiian Islands, based on the Mulitfan CL 
model, has found that recruitment dropped in the 
late 1980s, and remained at lower levels through 
to the present (G. Dinardo, PIFSC pers. comm.).  
This finding is consistent with earlier evidence of 
a drop in ecosystem productivity in the 
Northwestern Hawaiian Islands since 1989 
(Polovina et al. 1994; Polovina and Haight 1999).

seal pups at Pearl and Hermes, Kure, and Midway Atolls (red).  Monk seal survival data for 2003 are 
preliminary.
A1.5 Fishes 
 
Albacore tuna (Thunnus abalunga) 
Juvenile albacore tuna migrate across the North 
Pacific Transition Zone (Laurs and Lynn 1991).  
The U.S. troll fishery, based in California, has a 
season roughly spanning the months April to 
October.  The troll fleet begins in the central North 
Pacific in April and moves eastward, following the 
albacore during their eastward migration.  In some 
years a productive fishing ground develops in the 
region between 140°–150°W longitude and 35°–
45°N latitude which persists through August, 
while in other years the fleet quickly moves across 
the Transition Zone to fishing grounds along the 
coast of North America.  A plot of the monthly 
percent catch of albacore in the troll fishery east of 
140°W shows that in the years 1995–97, a 
relatively small percentage of the total annual 
albacore catch was taken east of 140°W (Fig. 
A1.4).  However, since 1999 this pattern has 
changed with over 50% of the albacore landed east 
of 140°W, beginning in July (Fig. A1.4).  The shift 
in the fishing ground from the central Pacific to 
eastern North Pacific may be a response of the 
albacore to the more productive oceanographic 
conditions in the eastern North Pacific since 1999 
that persisted through 2003.  Not only is the shift 
in the albacore fishing ground an indication of 
oceanographic changes, the earlier arrival of an 
abundant population of albacore in the eastern 
North Pacific may have ecosystem impacts on the 
albacore prey population.

Summary 
 
The California Current System (CCS) extends from British Columbia, Canada, to northern Baja 
California, Mexico.  It is a well-studied area and benefits from a comparatively long history of physical 
and biological observations.  Conditions in the CCS are subject to decade-scale regime behavior, with an 
overlay of episodic warm El Niño and cold La Niña events that last a year or two. 
 
In the CCS, there have been strong ecosystem responses to the 1977 and 1989 regime shifts.  The 1977 
regime shift led to a protracted period of warm surface waters, with a deepening of the thermocline and 
the implication of lower productivity.  However, available zooplankton time series suggest that salp 
biomass declined after 1977, while euphausiid biomass remained unchanged, and copepod biomass 
actually increased.  Following the 1977 regime shift, overall recruitment improved for species such as 
Pacific sardine, and other species experienced intermittent very strong year classes (Pacific hake and 
Pacific cod).  After the 1989 regime shift, the warm surface waters intensified and became unproductive 
for many coastal species.  In coastal waters, zooplankton shelf species were replaced by more southerly 
and oceanic species.  Many fish species (Pacific salmon, Pacific hake, Pacific cod, rockfish species) 
experienced almost a decade of poor recruitment.  Southern migratory pelagics (Pacific sardines and 
Pacific hake) extended the northern limit of their distribution to northern British Columbia, and in some 
years, to the Gulf of Alaska. 
 
After an intense El Niño in 1998, the CCS experienced a very cold La Niña in 1999.  Since 1999, sea 
surface temperatures have tended to return gradually toward warm conditions similar to those in the 
1980s and early 1990s, but thermocline depths are now much shallower and nutrient levels are higher, 
generating higher primary and secondary production.  Beginning in 1999, coastal waters saw a return of 
shelf zooplankton, and many coastal fish stocks experienced substantial improvements in year class 
success.  Some stocks produced good year classes in 1999 (e.g., Pacific hake), and recent returns of 
several salmon stocks have improved; Columbia River salmon runs have been extraordinary.  In addition, 
the distribution of migratory pelagics (Pacific sardine and Pacific hake) contracted to a more southerly 
distribution.  There is growing evidence, based on a strong and diverse biological response, that a regime 
shift favoring coastal organisms occurred in 1998. 
 
 
A2.1 Introduction 
 
The California Current System (CCS) extends 
along the west coast of North America from 
British Columbia, Canada, to northern Baja 
California, Mexico.  Although this is one of the 
most thoroughly studied portions of the world’s 
ocean, its properties and dynamics are still not 
well understood.  During the decade of the 1990s, 
patterns of low frequency (periodicity greater than 
10 years) and large-scale (extent greater than 1000 
km) fluctuations in the ocean and atmosphere that 
appear to have a strong influence on biological 
productivity of the system, were identified.  The 
CCS exhibits these regimes and regime shifts 
especially strongly. 
66 
A2.2 Physical Oceanography 
 
The oceanography of the CCS has been relatively 
well studied, principally because of the long 
history of the California Cooperative Oceanic 
Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) field survey 
program (Bograd et al. 2003) and a long sampling 
record off Oregon (Smith et al. 2001).  The 
interaction of large-scale circulation of the North 
Pacific with regional and local forces and factors 
of the coastal continental boundary controls the 
circulation and water mass properties of the CCS.  
The surface flow, the California Current, is the 
southward-flowing, eastern segment of the 
clockwise North Pacific Gyre, receiving cool, low-
salinity, nutrient-rich water from the North Pacific 
Current off Oregon, Washington, and southern 
British Columbia (about 45°–50°N).  It terminates 
off Baja California where it feeds the offshore-
flowing component of the Gyre.  
 
Most of the large-scale southward flow occurs in 
the upper 200 m of the ocean.  The California 
Undercurrent is a warm, high-salinity, low-oxygen 
poleward flow that lies along the continental slope 
centered at about 250–300 m depth.  Hickey 
(1979, 1998) and Huyer (1983) provide detailed 
reviews of the CCS circulation and physical state. 
 
The CCS features a strong annual signal that is 
predominantly a result of seasonal shifts in large-
scale atmospheric forcing.  In spring, winds from 
the northwest establish persistent strong coastal 
upwelling, which continues into the fall (Fig. 
A2.1).  As a result, an equatorward coastal jet 
develops in spring, which moves offshore and 
develops meanders (Strub and James 2000).  The 
greatest seasonal eddy kinetic energy, and most 
complex physical environment in terms of fronts 
and eddies, occurs in late summer and fall.  The 
California Undercurrent shoals in late fall – at the 
time that upwelling-favorable winds slacken or 
become predominantly northward – and appears as 
a surface current, called the Inshore 
Countercurrent, or Davidson Current, in winter 
(Lynn and Simpson 1987).  However, nearshore 
poleward flows can be found locally off central 
California most of the year (Yoklavich et al. 1997; 
Steger et al. 2000). 
 
While the general transport of the CCS is 
southward, local variability in the flow is strongly 
influenced by coastal processes.  These include 
coastal topography and submarine bathymetry, 
local heterogeneity in wind forcing, and local 
freshwater inputs.  The most notable, and well 
studied, interruption in the generally southward 
flow is the Southern California Bight which 
features a predominant clockwise circulation and a 
distinct coastal countercurrent.  On a more local 
scale, headlands and capes determine sites of 
strong upwelling and upwelling filaments (Kelly 
1985; Brink and Cowles 1991; Rosenfeld et al. 
1994). 
 
The seasonal cycle is superimposed on significant 
interannual and longer variability.  One of the 
most important sources of interannual variability is 
the El Niño–La Niña forcing that originates in the 
equatorial Pacific (Enfield and Allen 1980; 
Chelton et al. 1982; Strub and James 2002).  The 
earliest recognition of their extratropical impacts 
was identified in the CCS following the 1957–58 
El Niño event (Sette and Isaacs 1960).  However, 
the signal of individual El Niños in the CCS varies 
(Schwing et al. 2002; Mendelssohn et al. 2003).  
Some events have a strong subsurface signal 
indicative of an equatorial origin that is 
transmitted via coastal ocean waves.  Others are 
predominantly a near-surface signal, suggesting 
that these El Niños affect the CCS primarily via 
atmospheric teleconnections and alterations of the 
CCS by local atmospheric forcing.  These patterns 
of spatial separation could affect populations 
differently, depending on their preferred habitat. 
 
The upper ocean response to climate forcing in the 
CCS is also partitioned laterally and vertically 
(Fig. A2.2).  Based on its physical character, the 
CCS can be separated into three distinct regions, 
which correspond to biogeographic provinces 
separated by Cape Mendocino and Point 
Conception (Parrish et al. 1983).  These regions 
feature distinctly differing climatologies.  The 
long-term climate shifts also are reflected 
differently in these regions, presumably because 
the dominant physics of each region interacts with 
large-scale climate signals (Schwing et al. 1998).  
For example, the central CCS region, which is 
dominated by coastal upwelling, has shown a 
tendency for increased spring–summer upwelling 
over the past 50 years that is not evident to the

north or south (Schwing and Mendelssohn 1997).  
Ocean temperatures to the north, and within the 
thermocline, began warming several years prior to 
the often-cited 1976 regime shift (Fig. A2.2). 
 
The CCS has displayed a long-term warming 
tendency throughout its extent (Roemmich and 
McGowan 1995; Mendelssohn et al. 2003). In 
addition, long-term increases in stratification and a 
deepening of the thermocline in the coastal CCS 
over the past 50 years (Palacios et al. 2004) imply 
that nutrient input to the photic layer and overall 
productivity has declined over time (Roemmich 
and McGowan 1995).  The magnitude and timing 
of the seasonal cycle of upper ocean temperature, 
thermocline strength and depth vary as well 
(Mendelssohn et al. 2004; Palacios et al. 2004), 
potentially affecting the ambient conditions for 
seasonal upwelling and the timing of biological 
cycles.  
 
Decadal-scale sea surface temperature (SST) 
variations in the CCS are strongly coupled with 
basin- to global-scale atmospheric fields, rather 
than to local wind forcing (Parrish et al. 2000).  
Interannual, decadal and longer-term fluctuations 
in the CCS are approximately synchronous with 
other eastern boundary current systems, 
demonstrating that global processes interacting 
with local dynamics are responsible for much of 
the long-term variability in the CCS – including 
regime shifts.  For example, the CCS and 
Humboldt Current regions, with similar dynamics 
(e.g., strong coastal upwelling zones), display 
corresponding long-term wind and SST trends, 
indicating that global climate variability 
contributes to geographically distinct regime shift 
responses (Mendelssohn and Schwing 2002). 
 
The spatially distinct responses to regime shifts 
and long-term climate change are likely to lead to 
different impacts on marine populations, 
depending on the CCS regions and depths they 
exploit.  For organisms that inhabit different 
regions at different life stages (larval versus adult), 
or during key life strategies (migration, 
reproduction), this may provide a clue about which 
of these biological aspects are most sensitive to 
climate variability. 
A2.3 Lower Trophic Levels 
 
Phytoplankton and pigment concentration 
For various reasons, there is less information 
available about possible phytoplankton regime 
shifts in the CCS.  Part of the problem is difficulty 
of sampling – phytoplankton populations can 
bloom very rapidly and locally in the CCS, so data 
series must be very densely spaced to avoid the 
aliasing of high frequency variability.  In more 
slowly varying offshore populations, Venrick et al. 
(1987) showed a strong upward trend in Central 
Gyre chlorophyll concentration from 1964–85, 
with the strongest change near 1975.  Within the 
CCS, the best hope for time series is from 
sequential satellite mapping of ocean color.  Two 
non-overlapping time series are now available: 
 
1. CZCS (Coastal Zone Color Scanner) 1978–86, 
and 
2. SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view 
Sensor) 1997–present. 
 
Neither period captures the hypothesized 1977 and 
1989–90 regime shifts, and the two data sets are 
not fully intercomparable.  However, the recent 
1998–99 period was resolved extremely well.  
Average pigment concentration 0–100 km from 
the coast increased after 1998 throughout the CCS 
(Fig. A2.3), and the margin of the zone of high 
pigment concentration also moved farther offshore 
(Thomas et al. 2001). 
 
Information about changes in phytoplankton 
species composition within the CCS is potentially 
available for some taxa (mostly larger species with 
hard cell walls).  A long time series of 
phytoplankton cell counts has been collected from 
the Scripps Pier, but has not been fully analyzed 
and interpreted.  Varved sediment columns from 
anoxic basins in, and near, the CCS provide a 
potentially very long time record, but must be 
interpreted with care due to selective and time-
cumulative dissolution of microfossils.  Sancetta 
(1995) reports records from the Gulf of California, 
and McQuoid and Hobson (2001) from Saanich 
Inlet, British Columbia.

temperature, based on 110 time series.  The first trend is the system tendency for warming, with El Niño–
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and regime shifts superimposed.  The second trend is a cross-shore mode, 
with coastal locations having a stronger impact from ENSO and decadal events.  The third trend is an 
alongshore mode, showing ENSO events with a greater northern extent.  The fourth trend is a depth 
mode, showing trends in stratification.  Blue vertical bars highlight 1970 and 1976 to contrast differences 
in the 1970s regime shift in different geographical domains of the CCS (adapted from Mendelssohn et al.

Chlorophyll estimates are averaged within each month and across the 0–100 km zone extending seaward

high pigment concentration became more prolonged and extensive (updated and extended from Thomas 
et al. 2001; courtesy, A. Thomas). 
 
71
Zooplankton 
Long-term  (>20 years) records of zooplankton 
biomass and community composition in the CCS 
are available from central–southern California 
(CalCOFI 1950–present), southern Vancouver 
Island (1979–present), and central Oregon (1969–
73, 1983, and 1996–2001).  Collectively, they 
provide strong evidence that zooplankton 
variability at decadal time scales is: 
 
• intense (order of magnitude typical range);  
• coherent in form over the full width of the 
CCS and over alongshore distances >400 km; 
• sometimes abrupt, with major transitions 
between high and low abundance matching 
within ±1 year the “regime shift” dates 
identified from climate and fisheries indices; 
• coherent in the timing of transitions, perhaps 
extending the full alongshore length of the 
CCS, and poleward into the Alaska Current 
system. 
 
Data from the CalCOFI region are summarized in 
Figures A2.4 and A2.5, and from British Columbia 
and Oregon in Figure A2.6.  In all three regions, 
the zooplankton time series show large and 
persistent deviations from local average annual 
cycles.  Runs of higher-than-average or lower-
than-average abundance typically persist for 5–10 
years or longer (vs. the 1- to 2-year duration of 
individual ENSO events).  
 
For the CalCOFI region, the earliest analyses (Fig. 
A2.4) were by Bernal (1979, 1981), Bernal and 
McGowan (1981), Chelton et al. (1982), and 
Roessler and Chelton (1987).  These covered data 
from 1951–82, and were mostly confined to 
zooplankton biomass.  (Roessler and Chelton 
(1987) added a brief discussion of 1958 anomalies 
in alongshore species distributions.)  In each of the 
four alongshore sub-regions extending from San 
Francisco Bay to southern Baja California, 
zooplankton biomass from 1950–57 was very 
high, and from 1958–62, very low.  From 1962–
82, biomass was initially high but became 
anomalously low part way through the 1970s 
(earlier off southern Baja California; later off 
central California).  Higher biomass was 
significantly correlated with various indices of 
stronger equatorward flow in the California 
Current (low coastal sea level, cross-shore 
dynamic height gradient, low temperature, low 
salinity).  However, much of the total variance 
(especially in the physical data) was associated 
with the start of the 1958 El Niño event.  
 
Fig. A2.4 1951–82 time series of zooplankton 
biomass anomalies in four regions of the CCS.  
Regions are arranged from north to south:  (I) San 
Francisco to Point Conception, (II) Point 
Conception to San Diego, (III) Baja California 
(San Diego to Puenta Eugenia), (IV) Baja 
California Sur (Puenta Eugenia to Isla 
Magdalena).  Note the strong alongshore 
covariance over an alongshore distance of nearly 
1500 km (from Roessler and Chelton 1987). 
72 
Subsequent CalCOFI sampling and analyses have 
been restricted to the alongshore zone between 
Point Conception and San Diego (30°–35°N).  
Results are summarized in Figure A2.5.  
Roemmich and McGowan (1995) and McGowan 
et al. (2003) showed that a prolonged downward 
trend in total zooplankton biomass began in the 
mid-1970s (perhaps in 1976) and continued 
through to 1998.  This decline affected the full 
width of the California Current (Fig. A2.5) but 
was more strongly correlated with sea surface 
warming and an increase in vertical stratification, 
rather than with either upwelling intensity or 
transport variability.  However, taxonomically-
resolved time series for the CalCOFI region (side 
bars in Fig. A2.5) have been produced for pelagic 
tunicates (Lavaniegos and Ohman 2003), 
copepods (Rebstock 2001, 2002, 2003) and 
euphausiids (Brinton and Townsend 2003), and 
these time series indicate that the overall decline in 
total zooplankton biomass was driven by long-
term declines in the biomass of pelagic tunicates.  
Lavaniegos and Ohman (2003) documented a 
major decline in abundance of some (but not all) 
salp species after the mid-1970s, and a subsequent 
increase in abundance since 1999.  Rebstock 
(2001, 2002, 2003) found that the copepod 
dominance hierarchy was stable (nearly always 
dominated by Calanus pacificus and Metridia 
pacifica).  Strong El Niño conditions during the 
late 1950s and early 1980s affected copepod 
abundance (Rebstock 2002).  The 1977 regime 
shift resulted in an increase in abundance of 
calanoid copepods, and the 1989 regime shift 
corresponded to a decrease in copepod abundance 
around 1990 (Rebstock 2002).  Subsequent 
observations support an additional large increase 
in copepod abundance in 1998–99.  Large changes 
in euphausiid community composition have been 
observed, with subtropical species increasing in 
dominance since the late 1970s, but from 1999 to 
at least 2002, there has been a return to dominance 
of subarctic euphausiid species (Brinton and 
Townsend 2003).  Unlike pelagic tunicates and 
calanoid copepods, there does not appear to be any 
significant changes in euphausiid abundance 
across regime periods (Brinton and Townsend 
2003).  
 
Data from the British Columbia and Oregon 
 
continental margins (Fig. A2.6, plus far right 
sidebar in Figure A2.5) show very strong spatial 
and temporal covariance within groups of 
ecologically similar species.  The most striking 
result was a partial to near-complete replacement, 
during the 1990s, of the resident continental shelf 
copepod community (dominated by Calanus 
marshallae, Pseudocalanus mimus, and Acartia 
longiremis) by species “normally” abundant off 
central and southern California (Clausocalanus 
spp., Paracalanus parvus, and Ctenocalanus 
vanus).  This trend abruptly reversed during the 
1997–99 El Niño–La Niña, and since 1999 the 
zooplankton community has resembled the 
average for the 1970s–80s. 
 
A2.4 Invertebrates  
 
Significant changes in species composition have 
been observed when large-scale ecosystem re-
organizations have occurred.  Globally, Caddy and 
Rodhouse (1998) noted that as groundfish stocks 
have declined, they appear to have been replaced 
by increases in cephalopod populations.  In the 
coastal Gulf of Alaska, a switch from a 
crustacean- to a groundfish-dominated system was 
observed, following the regime shift of the late 
1970s (Anderson and Piatt 1999).  In the 
Northwest Atlantic, there was a significant change 
in species composition following the collapse of 
the northern cod stock, but in contrast to that in the 
Gulf of Alaska, the shift in the Northwest Atlantic 
was from a groundfish- to a crustacean-dominated 
system.  
 
In California, the top three most valuable fisheries 
(as landed value) have recently been market squid 
(Loligo opalescens), sea urchin (Strongy-
locentrotus fransicanus) and Pacific Ocean shrimp 
(Pandalus jordanii) (Rogers-Bennett 2002). 
Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) has long been a 
commercially important invertebrate in 
Washington and Oregon.  Landings of market 
squid, Dungeness crab, and Pacific Ocean shrimp 
in California, Oregon and Washington since 1981 
show marked declines in 1983 and 1998, 
corresponding to the strong El Niño events of 
those years; they also illustrate the increasing 
trend in landings over time for squid as the fishery 
developed (Fig. A2.6).

2002, 2003; red) and updated data (Ohman, pers. comm.), CCS salps from Lavaniegos and Ohman 
(2003), British Columbia/Oregon zooplankton from Mackas et al. (2004).  Arrows with a question mark 
denote transitions that are uncertain, either due to changes in sampling protocol (CCS copepods) or lack 
of data (British Columbia/Oregon zooplankton) (from Mackas 2004). 
74 
The recent decline in landings of squid (dominated 
by California) and the increases in landings of 
Dungeness crab (dominated by Washington and 
Oregon) suggest a possible change in the fisheries 
since 2001.  It should be noted that these crab 
populations appear to cycle in abundance, with 
peaks and troughs every 8–10 years (Otto and 
Jamieson 2001).  Landings of shrimp (dominated 
by Washington and Oregon) have been increasing 
since the 1998 El Niño and the return of cool 
water in 1999.  This recovery of ocean shrimp 
populations in the CCS is corroborated by fishery-
independent shrimp surveys conducted off 
southern Vancouver Island at the northern end of 
the California Current (Fig. A2.7).  The population 
biomass estimated from these surveys was highest 
in the mid-1970s prior to the 1977 regime shift, 
with a local maximum in 2002 after increasing 
since 2000, consistent with an expectation that this 
shrimp species does better with cooler conditions.  
Note there was a decrease in the population 
biomass off Vancouver Island (Fig. A2.7) and in 
Washington–Oregon landings (Fig. A2.6) in 2003, 
coinciding with warmer conditions of a mild 
ENSO event in late 2002.

A2.5 Fishes 
 
Pelagics 
Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) 
Coho salmon are one of seven species of the genus 
Oncorhynchus native to North America and are 
distributed from the Bering Sea as far south as the 
Sacramento River system in California (see 
Sandercock (1991) for a review).  Coho salmon 
are anadromous, migrating to the marine 
environment in the spring as smolts, and returning 
to freshwater in the fall and early winter of their 
third year to spawn and die.  Fry emerge from the 
gravel in the following spring and usually reside in 
freshwater for a year before migrating to sea as 
smolts.  Almost all coho spend 18 months at sea 
before returning to freshwater and therefore have a 
3-year life cycle.  Jacks (precocious males), which 
spend only 6 months in the ocean, are found in 
some populations.  Adult coho usually weigh from 
2–5 kg (45–70 cm in length) and only rarely 
exceed 9 kg.  Coho favor smaller streams and are 
widely dispersed within the northern portion of the 
California Current ecosystem.  The Fraser River is 
the largest river in British Columbia, and the 
interior Fraser (i.e., upstream of the Fraser canyon) 
constitutes most of the drainage basin.  Interior 
Fraser coho occupy a significant proportion 
(~25%) of the range of coho salmon within 
Canada.  Estimates of coho abundance for this 
region indicate a substantial decline in abundance 
from the early 1980s to the present (Fig. A2.8,  
 
from Simpson et al. 2004).  It is believed that 
reduced survival in the marine environment has 
been the main determinant of recent reduced 
population abundance.  Overfishing, changing 
marine conditions, and habitat perturbations all 
contributed to declines (Bradford and Irvine 2000; 
Bradford 1999).  Excessive fishing resulted when 
harvest rates were not reduced quickly enough in 
response to climate-driven declines in marine 
productivity.  In addition, coho declines were 
often related to the intensity of human disturbance 
in freshwater, whereby extensive urbanization has 
impacted available spawning habitats through 
stream destruction or watershed impacts from 
upstream logging operations.  Comparable 
declines in coho marine survival have been noted 
in the Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound and in the 
Oregon coho production index (Beamish et al. 
2001a).  All three indices suggest a long-term 
decline in coho survival, beginning in the mid-
1970s.  However, recent improvement in the 
Oregon coho production index implies that 
conditions have changed since 1999 (Fig. A2.9).  
Beamish et al. (1999, 2001a) suggest that the 
reduction in survival is related to a number of 
changes in the oceanic environment, particularly 
the Aleutian Low Pressure Index (ALPI) which 
may have reduced the available food supply of 
coho smolts, leading to increased overwinter 
mortality.  In addition, in the Strait of Georgia 
there may have been increased competition for 
food with Pacific herring during the first year in 
the ocean, again impacting coho survival 
(Beamish et al. 2001b).

Adult Recruitment (thousands)
 
Fig. A2.9 Adult recruitment estimates for Oregon Production Index coho salmon.  Data were provided 
by the Oregon Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Oregon Production Index Technical Team. 
 
Columbia River salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) 
The Columbia River experienced very low returns 
for many salmon species or stocks during the 
1990s, while relatively high values were recorded 
for spring and fall chinook (O. tshawytscha), coho, 
sockeye (O. nerka), and summer steelhead (O. 
mykiss) in the mid-1980s and again in 1999, 2000, 
and 2001 (Fig. A2.10).  Data for 2002 and 2003 
(not shown) include continued high returns for 
spring, summer, and fall chinook, and summer 
steelhead.  Spring chinook returns for 2004 were 
about 190,000 fish, well above the 10-year 
average and comparable to returns typically 
observed in the 1980s.  From 1940 to the mid-
1990s, there was an inverse relationship between 
Alaskan catches of sockeye and pink salmon (O. 
gorbuscha) and Columbia River spring chinook 
returns (Fig. A2.11).  Since the late 1990s, values 
have been high for both groups. 
 
Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) 
Pacific herring are distributed around the 
perimeter of the North Pacific, from the Yellow 
Sea in Asia, to southern California (Haegele and 
Schweigert 1985).  They are intertidal spring 
spawners throughout the range, laying adhesive 
eggs on any available algal substrates, and so 
depend on suitable inshore habitat at the beginning 
of their life cycle.  The eggs hatch into free- 
floating larvae within 2–3 weeks, depending on 
ambient water temperature.  Juveniles spend their 
first summer in inshore waters feeding on 
copepods, then migrate offshore to join immature 
and adult stocks during the fall of their first year or 
late spring of their second summer.  In general, 
herring migrate back to their spawning areas for 
the first time at age 3 in the south and age 4 in the 
north.  Herring in the eastern Pacific normally live 
to ages less than 10 years, although fish as old as 
age 15 have been taken historically in some areas.  
 
The California Current ecosystem supports a 
substantial number of herring stocks.  Numerous 
minor herring stocks exist between San Diego and 
Vancouver Island, including Puget Sound.  The 
major stocks in this ecosystem are found in San 
Francisco Bay, on the west coast of Vancouver 
Island (WCVI), and within the Strait of Georgia.  
Herring abundance within the San Francisco Bay 
area has fluctuated dramatically from very high 
levels, exceeding 100,000 tons in the early 1980s, 
to less than 20,000 tons in recent years (Watters, 
pers. comm.; Fig. A2.12).  No clear explanations 
for the decline are evident but negative impacts of 
the strong 1982–83 El Niño on herring growth and 
survival have been noted (Spratt 1987).  Within 
the northern part of this current system, a number 
of small stocks occur within Puget Sound, and 
these have remained at relatively stable levels, 
with the exception of Cherry Point, which has 
 
77
declined dramatically since the early 1980s when 
it was impacted by a significant roe fishery.  
Despite fishery closures, the stock has not 
recovered.  The other two major herring stocks at 
the northern edge of this ecosystem spawn on the 
WCVI and in the Strait of Georgia (Schweigert 
2001).  After being decimated by a reduction 
fishery in the late 1960s, both stocks recovered to 
high levels of abundance in the early 1970s, 
approaching 200,000 tons combined (Fig. A2.12).  
Abundance declined markedly in both areas in the 
mid-1980s, approaching 50,000 tons, and then 
increased again.  The Strait of Georgia stock has 
increased almost exponentially, reaching a 
historical high of over 150,000 tons in recent 
years, while the WCVI stock increased to about 
50,000 tons in the late 1980s, and has 
subsequently declined to about 20,000 tons in 
recent years.  Factors affecting the survival and 
productivity of these stocks are only partially 
understood.  Herring on the WCVI are impacted 
by hake on the offshore feeding grounds and have 
shown lower recruitment in years of higher SSTs 
when it is expected that more hake migrate farther 
north to feed on immature herring (Ware and 
McFarlane 1986).  However, herring in the Strait 
of Georgia continue to show good survival rates, 
and it is suggested that the reduced growth rate of 
hake has mitigated herring predation by hake in 
this area (McFarlane et al. 2001).

A number of authors have also noted an inverse 
relationship between herring survival and SST in 
the northern California Current ecosystem (Ware 
1991; Schweigert 1993; Zebdi and Collie 1995; 
Williams and Quinn II 2000).  It appears that this 
effect occurs primarily in the outer coastal areas 
and is associated with increased predation, 
possibly in conjunction with negative impacts on 
the food supply.  Environmental impacts on 
herring in the more southerly stocks appear to be 
associated with major El Niño events which affect 
the food supply, adversely impacting growth rate, 
and ultimately the survival of herring in San 
Francisco Bay (Spratt 1987). 
 
Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) 
During the twentieth century, Pacific sardine 
abundance fluctuated from a high of 3 million tons 
ca. 1930, to undetectably low levels in the 1960s 
and 70s, and back to 1 million tons at the end of 
the century (Murphy 1966; MacCall 1979; Conser 
et al. 2002).  Patterns of sardine scales preserved 
in laminated anaerobic sediments, representing 
nearly 2000 years of history, indicate that 
California’s sardines have always been subject to 
very large fluctuations in abundance (Baumgartner 
et al. 1992).  The recent increase in sardine 
abundance appears to have been associated with 
post-1976 environmental conditions.  Jacobson 
and MacCall (1995) describe the relationship 
between sardine recruitment, parental abundance 
and multi-year average SSTs measured at the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography Pier (Fig. 
A2.13).  At an average temperature of 16.5°C 
(typical of the 1945–1975 period), the sardine 
stock has almost no surplus production and cannot 
sustain a fishery.  At a temperature of 17.3°C 
(typical of pre-1945 and post-1975 years), 
sustainable yield can potentially exceed 1 million 
tons annually, provided the parental abundance is 
at a biomass of about 2 million tons, a level that 
has not yet been achieved in the recent recovery.  
Except for a brief cooling period in 1999, Scripps 
Pier temperature continued to be warm through 
2003 (Fig. A2.13). 
 
Pacific sardine are a migratory species.  When the 
northern sardine stock is large and ocean 
conditions are favorable, sardines migrate to 
British Columbia waters in the summer to feed.  In 
1947, the fishery on these summer migrants 
collapsed due to the complete absence of sardines 
in Canadian waters.  After a 45-year absence from 
Canadian waters, sardines reappeared throughout 
the continental shelf waters off the WCVI in 1992.  
Research surveys indicated that their distribution 
from 1992–96 was limited to the southern part of 
Vancouver Island.  In 1997, their distribution 
expanded northward and by 1998, sardines 
inhabited the waters throughout Hecate Strait 
(northern coast of British Columbia), located east 
of the Queen Charlotte Islands, and up to Dixon 
Entrance (southeast Alaska).  Spawning was 
reported off the WCVI in 1997 and 1998.  In 1999, 
following the El Niño, research surveys indicated 
that sardine distribution in Canadian waters 
contracted southward.  By 2003, sardines did not 
appear in Canadian waters until late July and were 
confined to coastal inlets along Vancouver Island.  
The 2003 survey off Vancouver Island found 
virtually no sardines in the offshore waters, except 
in the south, and some concentrations at the mouth 
of the inlets. 
 
Gadids 
Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) 
Pacific cod are distributed throughout the coastal 
North Pacific, from Santa Monica, California, up 
through the Bering Sea and to the Sea of Japan.  
Growth is rapid within the first year, with Pacific 
cod reaching lengths of approximately 30 cm.  
Maximum recorded sizes exceed 100 cm, and 
estimated maximum age is 11 years (Westrheim 
1996).  Pacific cod recruit to the fishery at age 2 
and a length of approximately 40 cm, and are fully 
mature at age 3, corresponding to approximately 
50 cm (Westrheim 1996). 
 
In British Columbia, there are four stocks defined 
for management purposes:  Strait of Georgia, 
WCVI, Queen Charlotte Sound, and Hecate Strait.  
Though there are currently no genetic analyses to 
verify stock delineation, tagging studies indicate 
that there is very little movement of Pacific cod 
between these four areas (Westrheim 1996).  The 
WCVI and the Hecate Strait stocks have 
historically supported commercial fisheries, and 
are the two stocks for which stock assessment 
information is available.  Assessments on both 
stocks indicated a dramatic decline in biomass in 
80 
the 1990s, from historic high levels of abundance 
in the 1980s (Sinclair 2000; Sinclair et al. 2001; 
Starr et al. 2002).  These declines were attributed 
to nine poor consecutive year classes, beginning in 
1990 (DFO 1999).  The WCVI stock is part of the 
CCS.  A delay-difference assessment model (Starr 
et al. 2002), which incorporates Pacific cod 
bycatch rates in a shrimp trawl survey, provides 
estimates of the number of recruits, which has 
remained at low levels since 1990 (Fig. A2.14).

Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) 
Pacific hake range throughout the CCS, from Baja 
California to the Gulf of Alaska.  Their 
distribution and abundance are closely linked to 
oceanographic conditions in the Northeast Pacific.  
The biomass, which is typically over 1 million 
tons, supports large domestic fisheries in both 
Canada and the United States.   
 
Unusual juvenile and adult distribution patterns 
have been seen in the Pacific hake population 
since 1990.  Juvenile distribution expanded 
northward from 1994–99.  This was evident in the 
increased numbers of juveniles (ages 2 and 3) 
present in the Canadian fishery catches.  In 
addition, an acoustic survey in 1998 off the Queen 
Charlotte Islands (northern British Columbia) 
observed numerous age-1 juveniles (1997 year 
class).  During the 1990s, a greater proportion of 
the total mature population migrated into Canadian 
waters, and in some years were present in the Gulf 
of Alaska.  Equally dramatic was the contraction 
of Pacific hake distribution in 2000 and 2001, with 
a low occurrence of Pacific hake off Canada.  
Information from a 2003 survey indicates a return 
to distribution patterns observed in the 1980s, with 
the northern limit of Pacific hake distribution at 
northern Vancouver Island (central British 
Columbia). 
 
During the 1970s and 1980s, strong year classes in 
Pacific hake occurred every 3–4 years (1973, 
1977, 1980, 1984, 1987, 1988).  From 1989–98, 
there was only one strong year class of Pacific 
hake.  Reflecting this, acoustic estimates of Pacific 
hake biomass declined steadily from the early 
1990s, with the lowest observed biomass 
occurring in 2001 (738 thousand tons).  In 
contrast, the 2003 biomass estimate (1.8 million 
tons) increased 120% over the 2001 survey 
estimate.  The strong 1999 year class appeared as 
age-2 fish in the 2001 survey, and entered the 
mature population as age-4 fish in 2003.  This 
isolated large year class is principally responsible 
for the increase in biomass estimated for 2003, and 
abundance is projected to decline over the next 
few years (Helser et al. 2004).  This is the first 
above-average year class since the late 1980s. 
Rockfish 
Juvenile rockfish  (Sebastes spp.) 
The abundance of juvenile rockfish has been 
monitored off the central California coast since 
1983.  In May and June of each year, the National 
Marine Fisheries Service Santa Cruz Laboratory 
conducts a month-long midwater trawl survey at 
standard stations (Ralston and Howard 1995), and 
annual abundance indices are derived by a delta-
GLM (generalized linear model) approach using 
main effects of year, location and calendar date 
(Stefansson 1996).  About ten species of rockfish 
are regularly encountered, three of which are not 
significantly exploited.  The fish are sampled at an 
average age of about 100 days, near the end of 
their pelagic stage, and immediately prior to 
settlement.  It is assumed that the principal life 
history events determining recruitment strength 
have been experienced by that age.  Stock 
assessments of exploited species have confirmed 
that these juvenile abundances are well correlated 
with estimated recruitment strength.  Because 
conventional fishery stock assessments are unable 
to estimate recruitment strength until a cohort is 
several years old and has entered the fishery, this 
juvenile rockfish survey provides information on 
recent recruitment patterns that would not 
otherwise be available for many years.  
 
The poor recruitment experienced by many eastern 
Pacific groundfish species during the 1990s is 
shown clearly by the coherent decline of all ten 
rockfish species in the survey (Fig. A2.15).  Catch 
rates of juvenile rockfish declined 1000-fold from 
1988–98, a period of warming ocean temperatures.  
The pattern was shared by every species in the 
survey, including unexploited species.  Several 
species were not encountered at all by the survey 
from 1996–98, and those zero values of catch rate 
cannot be plotted on the log scale of Figure A2.15.  
Abundance of juvenile rockfish did not recover 
immediately with the shift to cooler ocean 
temperatures in 1999 and 2000, although recent 
stock assessments show that some groundfish 
species, such as bocaccio (S. paucispinis) and 
lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), produced unusually 
strong recruitment in 1999 (MacCall 2003; Jagielo 
et al. 2004).  Abundance of juvenile rockfish  
 
82 
increased somewhat in 2001, and in 2002–04, has 
returned to levels similar to those seen in the 
1980s.  Survey results in the El Niño year of 2003 
were lower than adjacent years, which is 
consistent with observations from previous El 
Niño years.

Summary 
 
Evidence suggests that there were climate regime shifts in 1977, 1989, and 1998 in the North Pacific.  
Ecosystem responses to these shifts in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) were strong after the 1977 shift, but 
weaker after the 1989 and 1998 shifts.  Variation in the strength of responses to climate shifts may be due 
to the geographical location of the GOA in relation to the spatial pattern of climate variability in the 
North Pacific.  Prior to 1989, climate forcing varied in an east–west pattern, and the GOA was exposed 
to extremes in this forcing.  After 1989, climate forcing varied in a north–south pattern, with the GOA 
acting as a transition zone between the extremes in this forcing.  The 1989 and 1998 regime shifts did not, 
therefore, result in strong signals in the GOA. 
 
There were both physical and biological responses to all regime shifts in the GOA.  However, the primary 
re-organization of the GOA ecosystem occurred after the 1977 shift.  After 1977, the Aleutian Low 
intensified, resulting in a stronger Alaska Current, warmer water temperatures, increased coastal rain, 
and, therefore, increased water column stability.  The optimal stability window hypothesis suggests that 
water column stability is the limiting factor for primary production in the GOA (Gargett 1997).  A 
doubling of zooplankton biomass between the 1950s–60s and in the 1980s indicates that production was 
positively affected after the 1977 regime shift (Brodeur and Ware 1992).  Recruitment and survival of 
salmon and demersal fish species also improved after 1977.  Catches of Pacific salmon, recruitment of 
rockfish (Pacific ocean perch), and flatfish (arrowtooth flounder, halibut, and flathead sole) recruitment 
and biomass all increased.  There are indications that shrimp and forage fish, such as capelin, were 
negatively affected by the 1977 shift, as survey catches declined dramatically in the early 1980s 
(Anderson 2003).  Availability of forage fish may have been related to the decline in marine mammal and 
seabird populations observed after the 1977 shift (Piatt and Anderson 1996).   
 
After 1989, water temperatures were cooler and more variable in the coastal GOA, suggesting that 
production may have been lower and more variable.  After 1989, British Columbia (B.C.) salmon catches 
and survival were low and Queen Charlotte Island (northern B.C.) herring declined.  Salmon catches in 
Alaska, however, remained high.  Groundfish biomass trends which began in the early 1980s continued, 
with increases in flatfish biomass.  By the late 1980s, arrowtooth flounder, rather than walleye pollock, 
were dominant.  Large groundfish biomass estimates resulted in negative recruit per spawning biomass 
anomalies of demersal fish. 
 
There is some indication that the GOA ecosystem may have weakly responded to the 1998 regime shift.  
Increased storm intensity from 1999 to 2001 resulted in a deeper mixed layer depth in the central GOA, 
and coastal temperatures were average or slightly below average.  After 1998, coho survival increased in 
southern B.C., shrimp catches increased in the northern GOA, and the 1999 year class of both walleye 
pollock and Pacific cod was strong in the northern GOA.  Recruitment information from longer-lived 
species will be available in the near future, enabling scientists to determine if there were other responses 
to the 1998 climate shift. 
  
88 
It is apparent that many components of the GOA ecosystem respond to decadal-scale variability in 
climate and ocean dynamics.  It is unknown if changes observed after the 1998 shift will persist in the 
GOA and how long the current conditions in the GOA will last.  Predicting regime shifts will be difficult 
until the mechanisms that cause the shifts are understood (Minobe 2000).  Monitoring indicator species is 
one method to improve our knowledge of the mechanisms that cause the shifts.  Potential indicator 
species of regime shifts would include those which have a short life-span, are sensitive to changes, are 
key trophic groups, and/or are targeted by fisheries which produce data that are readily available.  
Examples of potential indicator species in the GOA that fit some of these criteria include sockeye and 
pink salmon, juvenile fish abundance, ichthyoplankton, as well as zooplankton biomass and composition.   
 
A3.1 Introduction 
 
In this section we examine biological changes in 
the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) system, which is here 
defined to include coastal waters of northern 
British Columbia (B.C.), southeast Alaska, central 
Alaska and the central GOA.  Atmospheric 
processes that influence the central GOA, 
particularly seawater temperatures as measured 
along Line-P, are reported in Section 1 
(Subsections 1.2 and 1.3).  Also reported in 
Section 1 are recent oceanographic changes in the 
Alaskan Coastal Current, the Alaska Current and 
Alaskan Stream, the central and northern GOA 
and northern B.C.  Though data are limited, some 
recent nutrient and chlorophyll a concentration 
data were available and presented in this section.  
We provide zooplankton biomass data for the 
Alaskan Shelf and in the Alaskan Gyre.  Survey 
catch per unit effort (CPUE) of pandalid shrimp is 
given.  Where available, data are presented for 
catch, CPUE, recruitment, biomass, recruit per 
spawning biomass, and/or growth for pelagic 
fishes (Pacific herring, capelin, and eulachon), 
gadids (walleye pollock and Pacific cod), 
sablefish, flatfish (arrowtooth flounder, flathead 
sole, and Pacific halibut), and rockfish (Pacific 
ocean perch and yellowtail rockfish).  In stocks 
that are abundant, the relationship between recruits 
and spawners may not be linear, i.e., density-
dependent factors may limit recruitment.  Under 
these circumstances, the pattern of recruits per 
spawner will appear as an inverse of the spawning 
biomass because annual rates of production have 
leveled off.  For this reason, we present both 
recruitment and recruits per spawner.  Marine 
mammal and seabird information is also included. 
 
A3.2 Physical Oceanography 
 
Long-term hydrographic conditions in the GOA 
are based primarily on sampling at the GAK1 
station near the mouth of Resurrection Bay, along 
Line-P extending west from the mouth of Juan de 
Fuca Strait, and at British Columbia coastal 
lighthouses.  These are detailed in Section 1 
(Decadal-scale Climate Events). 
  
Water column temperature and salinity in the 
northern GOA respond to seasonal changes in heat 
flux, freshwater input and winds, but substantial 
long-term variability is evident over the past 
several decades.  A significant amount of 
temperature variance is at the 5-year period.  
Before 1977, the upper water column was 
anomalously cool and near-surface waters were 
anomalously saline.  Conditions after 1977 
alternated between warm fresh and cold saline 
waters.  The largest warm event occurred in 
association with the strong 1997–98 El Niño.  
These anomalies are advected into the region, 
rather than locally forced by winds, runoff, heating 
and cooling (Royer, in press).  Sea surface 
temperatures (SSTs) were average or below 
average at GAK1, and along Line-P during 1999–
2002.  However, summer 2002 and winter 2003 
temperatures were above normal at GAK1 and 
below average on Line-P (PICES 2004).  
Temperature at most depths is positively 
correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
(PDO).  A shallowing mixed layer depth trend has 
been observed at Ocean Station Papa, Line-P, but 
not in the northern GOA. 
 
Coastal temperatures also shifted to colder water 
after 1998, but this regime was interrupted by a 
warming in 2003, possibly a response to the 2002–
03 El Niño.  It is, so far, uncertain if this shift to 
warmer waters has continued into 2004.  Coastal 
salinities do not reveal an El Niño impact, nor a 
1998 regime shift, but do reveal a multi-decadal 
decline in salinity at Langara Island, (northern 
 
89
Queen Charlotte Islands).  The impact of this trend 
on nearby southeast Alaskan waters is not known. 
 
A3.3 Lower Trophic Levels 
 
Despite the long-recognized high fish productivity 
of the northern GOA shelf, there have been few 
studies of the nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll 
(phytoplankton biomass), and primary production 
which support this high fish production.  
Production in both the oceanic and neritic regions 
is highly seasonal, with very low production 
during winter and moderate to high production 
during the summer.  Light levels and the mixed 
layer depth are limiting factors of phytoplankton 
blooms in the winter and spring.  There is an 
increase in phytoplankton production in the spring; 
the bloom is not large in oceanic regions, but it is 
in neritic regions.  In coastal regions, the spring 
bloom of phytoplankton depletes surface waters of 
essential nutrients (primarily nitrate), therefore, 
spring bloom conditions are short-lived.  Mixed 
layer depth, light levels and nutrients may vary 
interannually, thereby affecting production. 
 
Nutrients 
Interannual variability in nutrient concentration in 
the coastal GOA can be large (Childers et al., in 
press).  This is illustrated with data from GAK1 
(core of the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC)) and 
GAK4 (located at mid-shelf) for 1998–2000 (Figs. 
A3.1 and A3.2).  In the northern GOA, March 
stratification was stronger in 1998 and 2000 than 
in 1999, with a well mixed, saltier and cooler 
upper 100 m.  Integrated over the entire water 
column, nitrate was lowest in 1998 and highest in 
2000 (almost double that of 1998) at both GAK1 
and GAK4.  This “initial” March condition is 
important because it sets an upper limit on total 
nitrate availability for the spring bloom, since 
there is little (or no) replenishment of shelf 
nutrients in the spring, or until late fall–winter.  
The higher concentration of nutrients in 2000 
resulted in larger phytoplankton blooms for that 
year (Figs. A3.1 and A3.2).  Nutrient 
concentrations at the surface (0–10 m depth) 
became completely depleted in each of the 3 years, 
but the timing and duration of the period of 
depletion varied interannually and spatially (across 
the shelf).  At GAK1, surface nutrients were 
depleted by July 1998 and August 1999.  
However, in 2000, a year with the highest 
beginning nutrient levels, nutrients were depleted 
by April, and remained depleted through October.  
At GAK4, there was less interannual variability in 
the timing of nitrate depletion, and surface nutrient 
depletion was apparent in July–August.  Nitrate 
depletion and the phytoplankton bloom occur first 
on the inner shelf, within the ACC and later on the 
middle and outer shelf.  This is likely due to the 
early water column stabilization on the inner shelf 
provided by the fresher water of the ACC.  At 
Ocean Station Papa, winter nutrient levels were 
low during most of the 1990s, but have increased 
in recent years. 
 
Phytoplankton 
Chlorophyll a concentrations are indicative of 
phytoplankton biomass, and vary seasonally and 
interannually (Childers et al., in press).  For 
example, March chlorophyll concentrations at 
GAK1 were low in 1999 relative to 1998 and 
2000.  However, May chlorophyll concentrations 
were highest in 1999 relative to 1998 and 2000 
(Childers et al., in press, Fig. A3.3).  The analysis 
by Childers et al. (in press) at GAK1 and an 
Empirical Orthoganal Function (EOF) analysis of 
SeaWiFS data for the entire GOA (Brickley and 
Thomas 2004) indicate that, overall, 1998 had the 
lowest concentrations of chlorophyll (Fig. A3.4).  
Also, the chlorophyll maximum was strongest in 
1999 and 2000, and somewhat weaker in 2001 
(Childers et al., in press; Brickley and Thomas 
2004).  Perhaps this “interannual” difference was a 
reflection of a seasonal difference in which the 
conditions in 1999 were such that the spring 
bloom was delayed substantially early in spring, 
but later was manifested as an abnormally intense 
spring bloom in May.  Unfortunately, we have so 
little data that defining “normal” is difficult, 
especially when one also considers the spatially 
patchy distributions.   
 
The community composition of phytoplankton 
may also vary interannually.  For example, 
phytoplankton at Ocean Station Papa shifted from 
an autotrophic flagellate-dominated community to 
one consisting of over 50% coccolithophores in 
2000, which were also observed in SeaWiFS data.

Zooplankton 
Zooplankton time series data are sparse for the 
GOA.  There is some evidence which suggests that 
the magnitude and timing of blooms respond to 
interannual and decadal-scale variability.  A 
doubling of zooplankton biomass was observed in 
the subarctic Pacific between 1956–62 and 1980–
89 (Brodeur and Ware 1992).  Also, data from a 
continuous plankton recorder suggest that 
mesozooplankton biomass increased during 2000–
02 (Fig. A3.5; PICES 2004).  Observations at 
Ocean Station Papa indicate that zooplankton 
population development timing has changed on a 
decadal scale:  development was late in the 1970s, 
early in the 1990s, and average from 1999–2001 
(Mackas et al. 1998; PICES 2004).  In southern 
B.C. waters, the community composition of 
zooplankton also appears to vary on a decadal 
scale and may be related to changes in the ocean 
and climate conditions (Mackas et al. 2001).  
From 1990–98, the zooplankton assemblage was 
comprised of species from areas to the south 
(California Current) (Mackas et al. 2001).  
Changes in primary and secondary production, as 
well as community composition, may influence 
the survival of larval, juvenile, and forage fish.

A3.4 Invertebrates 
 
Shrimp 
Abundance of pandalid shrimp, as sampled in 
small mesh surveys in the GOA, appears to vary 
on a decadal scale (Anderson 2003).  Abundance 
decreased after the mid-1970s, and increased after 
1998 (Fig. A3.6).  Average catch per tow for all 
pandalids combined increased to over 75 kg km
–1
 
in 2001, and was 38.5 kg km
–1
 in 2002.  Relative 
pandalid shrimp abundance at this level last 
occurred in survey results nearly 20 years ago, in 
the early 1980s.  The most significant recovery, 
among pandalid species, has occurred with 
Pandalus goniurus.  This species had become 
almost functionally extinct in GOA shallow 
nearshore locations where, formerly, it was locally 
abundant during the 1970s, but in 2002, CPUE 
was the highest on record since 1984.  The CPUE 
for all shrimp species approaches the abundance of 
the early 1980s for the survey series.  Therefore, 
recent survey results support the notion that 
pandalid shrimp, as a group, are showing signs of 
regaining importance in the community structure 
of the GOA.  Recent increases in shrimp 
populations are directly linked to colder conditions 
as indicated by the PDO (http://tao.atmos. 
washington.edu/pdo) since 1998.  Sustained high 
population abundance of pandalid shrimp, as a 
group, would require a continued shift to colder 
ocean conditions (Anderson 2000).  Along with 
favorable oceanographic conditions to allow 
strong recruitment of shrimp, there will also need 
to be declines in predation pressure.  These 
principle factors are important in determining 
future pandalid population trends and possibly 
trends in other species abundance, as well 
(Anderson 2003). 
 
Crabs 
Hecate Strait, British Columbia, is at the southern 
end of the Alaska downwelling system (Ware and 
McFarlane 1989) and the GOA, and has the largest 
B.C. population of Dungeness crab (Cancer 
magister).  In contrast to the Dungeness crab 
populations in the California Current System, this 
B.C. population does not appear to have 8- to 10- 
year cycles in abundance, but depends on sporadic 
recruitment events such as occurred in the early 
1990s (Fig. A3.7).  Landings per unit of effort 
(t vessel-day
–1
) declined to a minimum in 1998, 
coincident with the warm conditions of the large 
El Niño Southern Oscillation event, but have been 
increasing with the cooler conditions since 2000.  
This fishery has no catch quota limits, but is 
managed using a combination of size, sex (males 
only), and season restrictions.  The unit of effort 
used here (vessel days) does not account for 
potential increases in fishing power which may 
have occurred due to the rise in the number of 
traps per vessel.

A3.5 Fishes 
 
Pelagics 
Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) 
Pacific herring are distributed generally around the 
perimeter of the North Pacific, from the Yellow 
Sea in Asia, to southern California in North 
America (Haegele and Schweigert 1985).  Since 
herring are intertidal spawners, they are dependent 
on suitable inshore habitat for at least a part of 
their life cycle.  Pacific herring are spring 
spawners throughout the range, laying adhesive 
eggs on available substrata and hatching free-
floating larvae within 2–3 weeks, depending on 
ambient water temperature.  Juveniles spend their 
first summer in inshore waters feeding on 
copepods, then migrate offshore to join immature 
and adult stocks during the fall of their first year or 
late spring of their second summer, at which time 
they become more dependent on euphausiids.  In 
general, herring migrate back to their spawning 
areas for the first time at age 3 in the south and age 
4, or older, in the north.  Herring in the eastern 
Pacific normally live to ages less than 10 although 
fish up to age 15, or more, have been taken 
historically in some areas.  
 
The Alaska Gyre ecosystem supports a number of 
herring stocks.  In the GOA, herring range from 
the Aleutians to Prince William Sound, with the 
latter area supporting the largest stock.  In 
southeast Alaska, several stocks are fished on a 
routine basis, with the most important stocks 
occurring at Sitka.  In British Columbia, there are 
three major northern migratory stocks (Prince 
Rupert, Queen Charlotte Islands, and the Central 
Coast), all of similar relative abundance.  The 
major stock in the GOA occurs in Prince William 
Sound, with an estimated spawning biomass 
approaching 170,000 tonnes in the late 1980s 
(Johnson 2002).  The fishery has been conducted 
with purse seines, drift gillnets, or trawls for fall 
food and bait.  The spring fishery for roe consists 
of both seine and drift gillnet gear sectors, as well 
as a wild and pound spawn-on-kelp fishery.  As in 
British Columbia, an extensive reduction fishery 
occurred throughout southeast Alaska from the 
1930s through the mid-1960s when stocks 
collapsed.  The fishery was closed and re-opened 
as the current roe fishery in 1971. 
 
Since 1974, the fishery catch has averaged 6,000 
tonnes annually, with numerous closures since 
1994 (Johnson 2002).  Survival of young-of-the- 
 
 
97
year herring is determined by the amount of 
energy they store before their first winter (Foy and 
Paul 1999).  There is also evidence of high levels 
of viral hemorrhagic septicemia, Ichthyofonus 
hoferi, in some years, which has been suggested as 
the limiting factor in the slow recovery of this 
stock (Marty et al. 1998).   
 
Within southeast Alaska, the major herring stock 
spawns at Sitka, with abundance fluctuating 
between 25,000 and 50,000 tonnes, roughly half 
the entire abundance in southeast Alaska (Fig. 
A3.8).  Other significant runs occur at Kah 
Shakes, Craig, and W. Behm Canal.  Overall, total 
abundance in the area has remained relatively 
stable since 1980, with an increasing trend since 
1994.  The largest fishery occurs at Sitka, using 
purse seines. 
 
In B.C., abundance of the three major herring 
stocks has fluctuated since 1980, with no clear 
trends in Prince Rupert or the Central Coast (Fig. 
A3.8; Schweigert 2001).  The population in the 
Queen Charlotte Islands increased to a recent high 
level in the early 1980s, and has subsequently 
declined to a near-historic low level with no 
evidence of recent rebuilding despite the absence 
of all but the spawn-on-kelp fishery.  Overall, 
combined abundance of these stocks has averaged 
about 87,000 tonnes since 1951, but has declined 
from over 100,000 tonnes in the early 1980s to 
about 60,000 tonnes in recent years.  
 
It has been noted by Williams and Quinn II 
(2000b), Zebdi and Collie (1995), and others that 
herring populations in the GOA are closely linked 
to environmental fluctuations, particularly SST.  
Herring stocks in southeast Alaska and B.C. were 
found to respond in opposite directions to 
temperature inputs although the mechanisms 
involved remain unclear.

Capelin (Mallotus villosus)  
Capelin are distributed along the coastlines of 
southern British Columbia to Alaska (Nelson 
2003), in cool slope waters (Hollowed et al., in 
review).  Capelin spawn in spring in intertidal 
areas at the age of 3–4 (11–17 cm) and most die 
after spawning (Pahlke 1985).  Fast-growing 
capelin mature earlier than slow-growing capelin.  
Capelin catches in the Alaska Department of Fish 
and Game (ADF&G) small mesh survey in the 
northern GOA decreased in the 1980s (Fig. A3.9; 
Piatt and Anderson 1996; Anderson and Piatt 
1999).  Capelin have remained at relatively low 
levels of less than 0.1 kg km
–1
, well below their 
historic peak abundance of 16.8 kg km
–1
 in 1980 
(Anderson 2003).  The decline in capelin 
abundance has been attributed to an increase in 
water temperature (Piatt and Anderson 1996; 
Anderson et al. 1997).  Capelin are also captured 
incidentally in the National Marine Fisheries 
Service (NMFS) Resource Assessment and 
Conservation Engineering (RACE) bottom trawl 
survey of the shelf, which may provide an index of 
abundance (Fig. A3.9).  Catches were high in the 
central and eastern GOA in 1996.  However, this 
survey is not designed to assess capelin, and 
increases in abundance were influenced by a very 
few and unusually large catches (Brown 2003).   
 
Eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus)  
Eulachon are distributed from northern California 
to the Bering Sea.  They are anadromous fish that 
spawn in coastal rivers.  Eulachon spawn primarily 
at the age of 3 and most do not survive after 
spawning.  Very little is known about eulachon, 
but observer and fishery data suggest that their 
abundance decreased in the 1980s (Fritz et al. 
1993).  Average eulachon catch in the north GOA 
ADF&G small mesh survey was 1.9 and 
6.7 kg km
–1
 during the 2001 and 2002 surveys, 
respectively (Fig. A3.9).  This is the highest level 
observed for eulachon in the last 30 years.  Recent 
ocean conditions have been optimal for juvenile 
survival.  A major recruitment event of juvenile 
eulachon was evident in the size frequency data 
collected in 2002.  A strong size mode at around 
8 cm fork length was evident in many sampling 
locations (Jackson 2003).  This size mode of 
eulachon in small-mesh trawl survey catches is 
seldom observed.  High catches were also 
recorded in the NMFS RACE bottom trawl survey 
in 2001, although this survey was not designed to 
sample these fish (Fig. A3.9). 
 
Salmonidae 
Pacific salmon rear in the GOA and central Bering 
Sea and are managed in four regions of Alaska:  
southeast Alaska, central (Prince William Sound, 
Cook Inlet, and Bristol Bay), AYK (Arctic, 
Yukon, Kuskokwim), and westward (Kodiak, 
Chignik, and Alaska Peninsula).  Salmon 
distribution throughout the GOA and Bering Sea 
varies by species and stocks, some of which 
migrate between the two areas (K.W. Myers, 
University of Washington, pers. comm.).  Pink, 
sockeye, and coho salmon generally spend the 
majority of their ocean lives in offshore pelagic 
waters, bounded by brief periods of migration 
through coastal areas as juveniles and returning 
adults.   
 
Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) are 
distributed from California to Russia and Korea.  
They have a 2-year life cycle that genetically 
separates odd and even year pink salmon.  Pink 
salmon spawn between June and October in 
intertidal zones or in streams, within a few miles 
of the coast.  Eggs hatch in winter or spring, and 
fry migrate from streams to the ocean.  Sockeye 
salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) are distributed from 
California to the Bering Sea and Japan.  They 
spawn in late summer to fall, depending on 
temperature, in streams and tributaries.  Eggs 
hatch in the spring, and fry migrate downstream to 
lakes where they spend 1 to 3 years before 
migrating to sea.  Sockeye spend 1 to 4 years at 
sea before returning to their natal streams to spawn 
and die.  Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) is 
one of seven species of the genus Oncorhynchus 
native to North America.  Coho salmon are 
anadromous, migrating to the marine environment 
in the spring as smolts and returning to freshwater 
in the fall and early winter of their third year to 
spawn and die.  Fry emerge from the gravel in the 
following spring and usually reside in freshwater 
for a year before migrating to sea as smolts.  
Almost all coho spend 18 months at sea before 
returning to freshwater and therefore, have a 3-
year life cycle.  Jacks (precocious males), which 
spend only 6 months in the ocean, are found in 
 
99
some populations.  Adult coho usually weigh from 
2–5 kg (45–70 cm in length) and only rarely 
exceed 9 kg.  Coho favor smaller streams and are 
widely dispersed throughout the GOA ecosystem.  
 
Catches of salmon are used as an index of salmon 
abundance because estimates of total runs are 
difficult to attain.  Generally, Alaskan salmon 
stocks have been stable and at high levels of 
abundance for the last 20 years (Fig. A3.10; 
Eggers 2003).  Asian stocks have shown similar 
trends, while Pacific Northwest and British 
Columbia stocks have been at lower levels.  
During the last decade, there have been some 
weak runs observed, particularly in certain areas of 
western Alaska, due to weak recruitment events.  
Notable examples include Yukon River fall chum, 
Yukon River summer chum, Yukon River 
chinook, and Kvichak River sockeye salmon.  
Observed weak year class strengths, however, 
have not been observed for most other Alaskan 
salmon stocks.  Abundance of sockeye salmon in 
all areas increased from the mid-1970s to the 
1980s (Fig. A3.10).  Since then the increased 
abundance has been stable and at high levels.  Pink 
salmon catches have generally been high in all 
regions in the last decade, and appeared to begin 
increasing in the late 1970s (Fig. A3.10).  Marine 
survival of Prince William Sound hatchery pink 
salmon appeared to increase after 1977, but does 
not appear to have shifted after the 1989 or the 
1998 regime shifts (Fig. A3.11).  Coho catches 
have been moderate to high in all regions.  Coho 
fisheries in central and western Alaska are not 
fully developed due to the late run and lack of 
processor interest.    The coho catch in AYK from 
1998 to 2002 has been lower than in the previous 
decade, but still above catches in the 1960s and 
1970s (Fig. A3.10).  In northern B.C., the Skeena 
and Nass River systems support some of the

largest coho runs in this ecosystem.  Indices of 
coho abundance for this region indicate a 
moderate decline in abundance from the early 
1980s to the mid-1990s (Fig. A3.12), but a 
dramatic increase in abundance in recent years (J. 
Sawada, unpub. data).  It is believed that reduced 
survival in the marine environment has been the 
main determinant of the coho population decline, 
which has recently ameliorated.  Overfishing, 
changing marine conditions, and habitat 
perturbations all contributed to coho declines 
(Bradford and Irvine 2000).  Excessive fishing 
resulted when harvest rates were not reduced 
quickly enough in response to climate-driven 
declines in marine productivity.  Bradford (1999) 
also notes that coho survival was highly correlated 
among geographically adjacent stocks, suggesting 
that local environmental conditions have a greater 
influence on coho production than global 
conditions.  However, factors determining larger-
scale coho survival are unclear, although Beamish 
et al. (1999) suggest there are evident climatic 
links. 
 
General trends in salmon production have been 
attributed to PDO-scale variability (Hare and 
Francis 1995), ocean temperature (Downton and 
Miller 1998), and regional-scale SSTs (Mueter et 
al. 2002).  A period of high Alaskan salmon 
production, from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s, 
has been attributed to changes in ocean and 
atmospheric conditions which increased survival, 
as well as enhanced hatchery releases (Beamish 
and Bouillon 1993; Coronado and Hilborn 1998; 
Mantua et al. 1997).  The increased production 
was accompanied by a decrease in average salmon 
weight at maturity, from 1975–93, which has been 
attributed to density dependence (Fig. A3.10; 
Bigler et al. 1996; Ishida et al. 1993), SST (Pyper 
and Peterman 1999; Hinch et al. 1995; Ishida et al. 
1995), and sea surface salinity (Morita et al. 
2001).   
 
Catch by species data were provided by Doug 
Eggers (ADF&G).  A full report (Eggers 2003) of 
run forecasts and a review of the 2002 season is 
available at http://www.cf.adfg.state.ak.us/geninfo 
/finfish/salmon/salmhome.htm#forecasts. 
Gadids and groundfish 
Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma)  
Walleye pollock are semi-pelagic and distributed 
throughout temperate and subarctic waters of the 
North Pacific (Wolotira et al. 1993).  They 
represent the second most abundant groundfish in 
the GOA and are exploited in the western/central 
GOA.  Major spawning concentrations occur in 
Shelikof Strait and near the Shumagin Islands 
(Kendall et al. 1996; DiCosimo and Kimball 
2001).  Fifty percent of females mature at age 5, or 
at about 43 cm length.  Juvenile pollock are 
pelagic zooplanktivores and are prey to many fish 
(Carlson 1995).  As pollock age, they become 
increasingly demersal, piscivorous, and potentially 
cannibalistic. 
 
Pollock biomass increased from 1969, peaked in 
1982, and has since decreased through to 2001 
(Fig. A3.13).  There was a significant linear 
decrease in survival (median recruit per spawning 
biomass anomalies) from 1969–2001.  Survival 
was significantly higher prior to the 1977 regime 
shift than after the shift (Fig. A3.13).  Pollock 
recruitment is variable, with strong year classes 
occurring every 4 to 6 years (Dorn et al. 2003).  
Rather than responding to decadal-scale 
variability, a higher incidence of strong year 
classes is associated with El Niño north conditions 
(Hollowed et al. 2001).   
 
Density-dependent processes may, in part, 
determine growth, or length-at-age, of pollock in 
the GOA.  Age 4 pollock tend to weigh less and 
are shorter when there is a strong year class, such 
as the 1988, 1994, and 1999 year classes (Dorn et 
al. 2003).  Pollock lengths at older ages, such as 
ages 7 and 10, increased from the early 1980s to 
the present (Fig. A3.13).  This increase in length-
at-age coincided with a decrease in total biomass 
of pollock in the GOA, suggesting density-
dependent growth.  The growth time series does 
not include estimates prior to the 1977 regime 
shift, and pollock growth did not appear to 
respond to the 1989 or 1998 regime shifts.  It is, 
therefore, unclear if the changes in pollock growth 
in the GOA were responses to decadal-scale 
climate variations.

Hecate Strait Pacific cod 
Fig. A3.13 Gulf of Alaska (GOA) gadid (walleye pollock and Pacific cod) recruits (millions of fish), 
biomass and catch (100,000 tonnes) in the left panels and median recruit per spawning biomass anomalies 
(middle panels).  The pollock length-at-age data (right panel) was taken from the echointegration trawl 
survey conducted annually in Shelikof Strait, Gulf of Alaska.  Hecate Strait Pacific cod stock recruits 
(1000s of fish) were estimated by a catch-at-length model (adapted from Sinclair et al. 2001). 
 
Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus)  
Pacific cod can be found at all depths up to 500 m 
on the upper slope and continental shelf of the 
North Pacific, from California to Norton Sound 
(Bakkala 1984).  Pacific cod are demersal fish that 
spend the winter and spring in deep waters, and 
migrate to shallower waters in the summer.  Fifty 
percent of females mature at about 6.7 years of age 
or 67 cm (Thompson and Dorn 2003).  Spawning 
occurs in late winter in relatively small areas near 
the bottom.  Eggs sink to the bottom and are 
adhesive (Hirschberger and Smith 1983), and after 
hatching, larvae occur in the upper 45 m of the 
water column.  Larvae migrate to deeper water as 
they grow.  Growth is rapid within the first year, 
with Pacific cod reaching lengths of approximately 
30 cm.  Juvenile Pacific cod consume 
invertebrates, and become omnivorous as they get 
larger.  Cod move over large areas, resulting in 
genetically indistinct stocks in the GOA, Aleutian 
Islands, and Bering Sea (Shimada and Kimura 
1994; Grant et al. 1987).   
  
104 
The biomass of Pacific cod increased during 
1978–90, remained high in the early 1990s, and 
then decreased to 2001 (Fig. A3.13).  There has 
been a decreasing trend in recruitment since 1990 
as well.  Median recruit per spawning biomass 
anomalies indicate that survival linearly decreased 
significantly from 1977 to 2001.  Pacific cod 
survival appears to vary on the same temporal 
scale as that of pollock in the GOA.  Median 
recruit per spawning biomass anomalies of GOA 
Pacific cod and pollock follow similar trends, 
suggesting that both species are responding to 
similar large-scale processes.  As with pollock, 
cod have a higher incidence of strong year classes 
and are associated with El Niño northern 
conditions (Hollowed et al. 2001).   
 
In British Columbia, there are four stocks defined 
for management purposes:  Strait of Georgia, west 
coast of Vancouver Island, Queen Charlotte Sound 
and Hecate Strait (adjacent to the GOA).  Though 
there are currently no genetic analyses to verify 
stock delineation, tagging studies indicate that 
there is very little movement of Pacific cod 
between these four areas (Westrheim 1996).  The 
west coast of Vancouver Island and the Hecate 
Strait stocks have historically supported 
commercial fisheries and are the two stocks for 
which stock assessment information is available.  
Assessments on both stocks indicated a dramatic 
decline in biomass (tonnes) in the 1990s from 
historic high levels in the 1980s (Sinclair 2000; 
Sinclair et al. 2001; Starr et al. 2002).  These 
declines contributed to nine poor consecutive year 
classes, beginning in 1990 (DFO 1999).  
Recruitment estimates are produced by a delay-
difference stock production analysis which 
incorporates research survey data (Sinclair et al. 
2001; Fig. A3.13).  
  
Recruitment in the Hecate Strait stock has been 
linked to sea level height, a proxy variable for 
relative water movement through Hecate Strait 
(Tyler and Crawford 1991).  In the 1990s, this 
environmental variable suggested that oceanic 
conditions were unfavorable for recruitment.  
However, since 1999, this variable has indicated 
that Pacific cod recruitment may be improving 
(Sinclair et al. 2001). 
Sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) 
Sablefish are distributed from northern Mexico to 
the GOA, Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea, and to the 
coasts of Siberia, Kamchatka, and northern Japan 
(Wolotira et al. 1993).  They are found at depths 
greater than 200 m along the edge of the 
continental slope, shelf gullies, and deep fjords 
(Sigler et al. 2003).  Tagging studies suggest that 
there are two populations:  a northern population 
that is distributed from Alaska to northern B.C., 
and a southern population that extends from 
southern B.C. to California (McDevitt 1990; 
Saunders et al. 1996; Kimura et al. 1998).  The 
two populations mix in waters off southern B.C. 
and northern Washington (Sigler et al. 2003).  
Sablefish spawn in the winter at the edge of the 
continental slope in depths between 300–500 m 
(McFarlane and Beamish 1983; McFarlane and 
Nagata 1988).  The northern population spawns 
approximately one month later than the southern 
population (Sigler et al. 2001).  Larval fish hatch 
at about 300–400 m depth, then descend to 1000 m 
within 18 days after spawning.  Within a few days 
of their descent, larval sablefish begin to ascend 
and feed on copepod larvae.  Juvenile sablefish 
inhabit shallow inshore shelf waters (< 200 m), 
and by ages 2–5, move to deeper offshore slope 
waters.   
 
Recruitment strength appears to be determined at 
the larval stage (McFarlane and Beamish 1992).  
Growth of sablefish is rapid in the first few years, 
then slows appreciably in this long-lived species 
(Sigler et al. 2001; Kimura et al. 1998).  Males 
tend to undergo a reduction in growth rate earlier 
than females.  The majority of fish in the fishery 
are between the ages of 4 and 35, but the oldest 
sablefish aged to date is 113 years (Beamish and 
McFarlane 2000). 
 
In Alaska, sablefish are assessed in the combined 
area of the GOA and Bering Sea with an age-
structured model that incorporates both fishery and 
survey catch data (Sigler et al. 2003).  Sablefish 
biomass peaked in 1968 and 1985, and was at a 
minimum in 1963, 1980, and 1997 (Fig. A3.14).  
Recruitment and survival have been variable but 
may be related to winter environmental conditions.  
Strong recruitment tends to occur when there is a  
 
 
105
northerly current drift or above-average SSTs 
(Sigler et al. 2001).  Strong year classes occurred 
in 1960, 1977, and 1984, which coincided with 
strong year classes of other groundfish in Alaska 
(Hollowed and Wooster 1992).  Recent strong year 
classes include 1995, 1997, and 1998 (Sigler et al. 
2003).    
 
In Canadian waters, sablefish are caught 
commercially by trap, longline and trawl fishing 
gear.  Over the last two decades, the commercial 
catch has ranged from 2,000 tonnes to 5,400 
tonnes, and has averaged approximately 4,500 
tonnes (Haist et al. 2004).  The stock is 
characterized by periods of strong and weak year 
class success (King et al. 2000).  Periods with 
above-average year classes are characterized by 
intense Aleutian Lows, above-average frequency 
of south-westerly winds, relatively weak winter 
downwelling, strong summer upwelling, and 
above-average abundances of subarctic and boreal 
copepods (King et al. 2001).  From 1977–88, the 
sablefish population had eight strong year classes, 
and four below-average year classes (King et al. 
2000).  From 1989–98, there were only two above- 
average year classes.  There is an indication that 
year class success has improved since 1998 (King 
et al. 2001; Haist et al. 2004). 
 
Productivity of the Canadian sablefish stock 
reflects the trends in recruitment.  Estimates of 
surplus production (Haist et al. 2004) exhibit a 
distinct decadal-scale pattern (Fig. A3.14).  From 
1980–93, estimates of sablefish productivity are 
above average.  From 1994–2002, these estimates 
are greatly reduced to average and below-average 
values.  In 2003, the estimate of productivity 
increases dramatically.  Sablefish recruit to the 
fishery at ages 4 and 5, so the changes in 
productivity described above correspond to the 
dynamics of the 1977–89; 1990–98 and the 1999 
year classes, respectively.

106 
Flatfish 
Arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias)  
Arrowtooth flounder are distributed from 
California to the Bering Sea, and can be found on 
the continental shelf at the ages of 1 to 4, after 
which they are found at depths of 100–200 m in 
shelf and slope waters (Allen and Smith 1988; 
Martin and Clausen 1995).  They are the most 
abundant groundfish in the GOA.  Spawning 
occurs offshore between September and March, 
and 50% of females are mature at the age of 5 
(Zimmermann 1997; Wilderbuer and Sample 
2003), or 47 cm in length (Zimmermann 1997).  
Juveniles initially consume zooplankton and, as 
they grow, begin to consume shrimp and small 
fishes (Wilderbuer and Sample 2003).  After 
arrowtooth flounder exceed 30 cm in length, they 
are primarily piscivorous, with their main prey 
consisting of walleye pollock (Wilderbuer and 
Sample 2003). 
 
Arrowtooth flounder biomass and recruitment 
were relatively stable during 1961–71, after which 
they increased to record high levels in 1997 (Fig. 
A3.15).  Median recruit per spawning biomass 
anomalies, an index of survival, were negative 
during 1961–69, and strongly positive from 1970–
79 (Fig. A3.15).  Change point analyses indicate 
that there was a significant step-change to higher 
survival after 1968, a significant linear decrease in 
survival during 1968–97, and minor, but 
significant, step-changes in 1979 and 1989.  This 
suggests that arrowtooth flounder survival 
responds to decadal-scale variability.  Recruitment 
success has been linked to improved transport to 
nurseries in El Niño years (Bailey and Picquelle 
2002).  Arrowtooth flounder length-at-ages 3–7 
did not appear to change between the 1980s and 
the 1990s, although sample size in the 1990s was 
small (Fig. A3.15; Turnock et al. 2003).   
 
Flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) 
Flathead sole and Bering flounder (Hippo-
glossoides robustus) are similar and managed as a 
single stock (Wolotira et al. 1993).  Flathead sole 
are distributed from northern California to Alaska.  
Adults are benthic, and overwinter near the 
continental shelf margin and migrate onto the 
outer shelf in spring.  Age and size at maturity are 
unknown, but spawning occurs in spring near the 
continental margin (Walters and Wilderbuer 
1997).  Eggs are pelagic and larvae are planktonic, 
occupying shallow waters where they consume 
zooplankton.  Flathead sole recruit to the fishery at 
age 3.  Adult flathead sole consume primarily 
benthic invertebrates.   
 
The time series of flathead sole in the GOA is 
short, beginning in 1981.  Therefore, it is difficult 
to determine if flathead sole respond to decadal-
scale climate variability.  Their biomass increased 
from 1984–96, and has declined in recent years 
(Fig. A3.15).  Median recruit per spawning 
biomass anomalies, indicative of survival, were 
higher prior to 1988 than in following years, 
however, the difference was insignificant (Fig. 
A3.15).  Strong recruitment of flathead sole in the 
Bering Sea may be linked to wind direction that 
advects larvae to nearshore nursery areas during 
spring (Wilderbuer et al. 2002).  However, it is 
unknown if a similar mechanism is responsible for 
flathead sole recruitment variability in the GOA.   
 
Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis)  
Pacific halibut are distributed in coastal waters 
from California to the northern Bering Sea to 
Hokkaido, Japan.  Halibut spawn off the 
continental shelf in December through February.  
They attain sizes of 96 cm at 50% maturity, 
corresponding to ages 10–12 (Clark et al. 1999).  
Eggs and larvae are pelagic for approximately 6 
months, after which the juvenile halibut, at 
approximately 35 mm length, settle in shallow 
waters for 5 to 7 years.  Halibut are highly 
migratory for up to 10 years of age, after which 
time they are less migratory.  The maximum 
recorded age for a halibut is 55 (IPHC 1998).  
Female halibut grow faster than male halibut 
(beginning around age 6) and attain much larger 
sizes.  The largest recorded size for a female is 
2.67 m, while males rarely exceed 1.5 m.  
Recruitment to the fishery begins around age 6, 
with full recruitment occurring around age 8–10 
for females and somewhat later for males.  Stock 
assessment of Pacific halibut is based on an age- 
and sex-structured model, with length-specific 
gear selectivity for commercial and survey data, 
and fit-to-age compositions for both commercial 
and survey catches (Clark and Hare 2004).  
 
107
The population dynamics of Pacific halibut 
appears to respond to decadal-scale climate 
variability.  Halibut biomass in the GOA generally 
increased after the 1977 regime shift through to 
the 1990s (Fig. A3.15).  In the central GOA (from 
southeast Alaska to the southwest end of Kodiak 
Island), halibut biomass peaked in 1994, and has 
since decreased to a biomass similar to that in 
1989.  Halibut biomass in southeast Alaska has 
continued to increase to the present, whereas 
halibut biomass in B.C. leveled off in 1999.  
Recruitment appears to have responded to the 
1977 regime shift, since it also increased after 
1977 in all areas of the GOA (Clark et al. 1999).  
Halibut length-at-age (growth) decreased 
significantly in the central GOA and decreased 
slightly in B.C. during this time (Fig. A3.15; Clark 
et al. 1999).  The decrease in halibut growth may 
be density dependent, rather than due to the 
environment.  Both intra- and inter-specific 
competition may be important since both halibut 
and other flatfish (arrowtooth flounder and 
flathead sole) increased in abundance during the 
same approximate time period (Clark et al. 1999). 
 
Rockfish 
Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus)  
Pacific ocean perch occupy depths from 40–650 m 
on the outer continental shelf and upper slope, 
from southern California to the GOA and Bering 
Sea (Allen and Smith 1988).  Fifty percent of 
females are mature by the age of 7 years, or at 
approximately 29 cm in length.  Pacific ocean 
perch are viviparous; they spawn in the fall and 
females release larvae in the spring (Love et al. 
2002).  Larvae are found in surface waters and 
juveniles settle in nearshore rocky habitats, then 
progressively move to deeper waters on the shelf.  
They are long-lived fish that are fully recruited at 
age 8 and can live as long as 98 years (Heifetz et 
al. 2002).  Pacific ocean perch begin recruiting to 
the fishery at age 7 and are fully recruited to the 
fishery by age 16.  They consume primarily 
zooplankton throughout their life cycle but also 
consume myctophids in increasing proportions as 
they grow larger (Yang 2003). 
Pacific ocean perch catches in the GOA declined 
in the late 1960s to the early 1980s, apparently due 
to overfishing, and began to increase after 1996 
(Fig. A3.16; Hanselman et al. 2003).  Current 
stock assessments indicate that biomass decreased 
to the late 1970s, after which it increased through 
to the 1990s (Fig. A3.16).  Survival of Pacific 
ocean perch appears to vary on a decadal scale and 
may be related to changes which occurred during 
regime shifts.  Median recruit per spawning 
biomass anomalies, indicative of survival, were 
negative prior to the 1977 regime shift, positive in 
the 1980s after the 1977 shift, and negative in the 
1990s after the 1989 shift (Fig. A3.16).  High 
autocorrelation between catch and recruitment 
time series also suggests that rockfish in the GOA 
respond to long-term influences (Hollowed et al. 
2001).  Pacific ocean perch growth, however, does 
not appear to have changed during the time period 
of 1984–96; there was a decrease in length-at-age 
in 1999 relative to other years (Fig. A3.16). 
 
Pacific ocean perch is the most important rockfish 
species by landed value in catch for British 
Columbia rockfish fisheries.  In Canadian waters, 
the primary fisheries for Pacific ocean perch occur 
in three gullies in Queen Charlotte Sound:  Goose 
Island Gully, Mitchell’s Gully and Moresby Gully.  
Other smaller fisheries occur off the west coasts of 
Vancouver Island and Queen Charlotte Islands.  
Based on parasite analyses, these five fishery areas 
are considered to be discrete stocks (Leaman and 
Kabata 1987).  Stock assessments indicate that 
population dynamics are similar between these 
stocks (Richards and Olsen 1996; Schnute et al. 
2001).  A catch-at-age model for the Goose Island 
Gully stock (Schnute et al. 2001) indicates a 
decline in biomass from 1994 through to 2000.  
This decline has been attributed to relatively low 
productivity (Fig. A3.16) for year classes since the 
late 1980s (Schnute et al. 2001).  If a new regime 
in 1998 results in improved recruitment for Pacific 
ocean perch, the resulting age 7 fish will not begin 
to appear in the fishery until 2005.

Pacific ocean perch productivity was estimated from a catch-at-age model by year class  (Schnute et al. 
2001).  Productivity approximates relative year class success lagged by approximately 8 years (age of 
recruitment). 
 
Yellowtail rockfish (Sebastes flavidus) 
Yellowtail rockfish are found throughout the 
Northeast Pacific Ocean, from southern California 
through to Admiralty Island, Alaska.  The center 
of abundance is from Oregon to British Columbia.  
Commercial concentrations are fished from about 
100–200 m depth (Lai et al. 2003).  Yellowtail 
rockfish attain a maximum size of 70 cm.  The 
oldest recorded age is 64 years.  Generally, the 
size at 50% maturity for females is 37–45 cm (6–
11 years old) and for males is 34–41 cm (5–9 
years).  Yellowtail rockfish begin recruiting to the 
fishery at age 4 (Lai et al. 2003).   
 
In B.C., yellowtail rockfish comprise two stocks:  
(1) the southern boundary stock, which is off the 
west coast of Vancouver Island and is considered 
to be an extension of the northern Washington 
stock (California Current System), and (2) the 
coastal stock, which ranges from northwestern 
Vancouver Island to Alaska (Gulf of Alaska 
system).  Data for the coastal stock are limited, but 
the population dynamics are considered to be 
similar to those observed for the southern 
boundary stock (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 
1999).  Poor recruitment in the early 1990s 
resulted in a severe decline in yellowtail biomass 
in the mid-1990s.  This trend has continued 
through 2002.  
 
A3.6 Higher Trophic Levels 
 
Marine birds  
Seabirds are distributed throughout the North 
Pacific and include albatrosses, shearwaters, 
petrels, cormorants, gulls, murres, murrelets, 
auklets, puffins, and sea ducks.  The diet of 
seabirds varies spatially, temporally, and among 
species, but includes zooplankton, squid, and 
forage fish, such as juvenile Pacific herring, smelt, 
sandlance, walleye pollock, salmon, rockfish, and 
flatfish.  
110 
Populations of many marine birds in Prince 
William Sound declined between the early 1970s 
and the early 1990s (Piatt and Anderson 1996; 
Lance et al. 2001).  This decline has been 
attributed to a shift in climate which affected the 
availability of forage fish to marine birds (Piatt 
and Anderson 1996; Agler et al. 1999).  For 
example, in Prince William Sound, sandlance 
comprised the majority of seabird diets in the 
1970s, whereas gadids were the main prey item in 
the late 1980s (Kuletz et al. 1997).  No discernable 
shifts have been observed in marine bird 
populations after the regime shifts of 1989 or 
1998.  However, marine birds are long-lived and 
population-level responses may lag behind regime 
shifts.  In general, throughout 2001 surface 
plankton feeding populations (fulmars and petrels) 
have been stable or increasing, diving piscivorous 
cormorants appear to have declined, Kittlitz’ 
murrelets are declining throughout the GOA 
(Kuletz et al. 2003), and trends of other marine 
bird populations vary among areas and species 
(Dragoo et al. 2003).  In the northern GOA, 
marine bird populations are generally declining, 
while those in southeast Alaska appear to be stable 
or increasing (Fitzgerald et al. 2003).  
 
There is a trend toward earlier breeding times 
throughout the North Pacific (Dragoo et al. 2003).  
The trend in breeding time could be due to climate 
changes and timing of spring plankton blooms 
(Root et al. 2003; Dragoo et al. 2003).  In 2001, 
marine bird hatch timing was average or early in 
most areas, except for Storm-petrels in southeast 
Alaska (Dragoo et al. 2003).  Also in 2001, the 
reproductive success of most plankton feeders was 
generally average to below average, whereas the 
reproductive success of surface-feeding piscivores 
(kittiwakes) and diving piscivores (cormorants, 
murres, murrelets, rhinoceros auklets, and puffins) 
was average to above average (Dragoo et al. 
2003).  
 
Marine mammals 
Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) 
Steller sea lions are distributed from California to 
Alaska and Japan (Loughlin et al. 1984).  There 
are two distinct populations:  the endangered 
western stock (from east of Prince William Sound 
to Russia and Japan) and the threatened eastern 
stock (from southeast Alaska to California) 
(Sinclair 2003).  The population assessment for 
Steller sea lions included a number of techniques 
in the past and is currently accomplished by aerial 
surveys of non-pups and on-land pup counts 
(Sinclair 2003).   
 
The western stock declined by about 70% from 
1960–89 (Loughlin et al. 1992).  Since then, the 
western stock has declined about 3.9% per year, 
from 1991–2001 (Strick et al. 1997; Sease et al. 
1999; Sease and Loughlin 1999; Sease and 
Gudmundson 2002).  An increase of 5.5% over a 
large geographic area (eastern GOA to the central 
Aleutian Islands) was observed in the population 
in 2002.  The western stock population size in 
2002, however, is still smaller than it was in 1998 
(Sinclair 2003). 
 
Overall, the eastern stock abundance is stable or 
increasing slowly, although in central and southern 
California numbers have declined by up to 10% 
per year (NMFS 1995; Calkins et al. 1999; Ferrero 
et al. 2000; Angliss and Lodge 2002).  The 
population in southeast Alaska increased by an 
average of 5.9% per year from 1979–97 (Sinclair 
2003).  Within the last decade, the abundance of 
Steller sea lions in southeast Alaska and British 
Columbia have increased annually by 2–6% 
(Sease et al. 2001).   
 
Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) 
Harbor seals are distributed from California to the 
GOA, Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands.  They are 
generally non-migratory, and feed in marine, 
estuarine, and freshwater (Scheffer and Slipp 
1944).  Currently the number of stocks in Alaska 
is a matter of huge debate, however, most 
scientists believe the previous number (three) is 
without merit.  Recent genetic data and analyses 
are presently undergoing independent review.  The 
overall harbor seal population in the GOA is much 
lower than it was in the 1970s and 1980s, but 
shows some signs of improvement.  The number 
of harbor seals in southeast Alaska is at least 
steady, if not still increasing (D. Withrow, 
National Marine Mammal Laboratory, pers. 
comm.). 
 
 
111
A3.7 Coherence in Gulf of Alaska Fish  
 
Patterns of variation in recruitment and survival of 
marine and anadromous fishes show synchronicity 
among stocks, ranging from regional to broad 
geographical scales.  Synchronous strong year 
classes occur in numerous groundfish populations 
from California to the Bering Sea (Hollowed and 
Wooster 1992), with fewer strong year classes in 
the GOA and Bering Sea than off the United 
States west coast (Hollowed and Wooster 1995).  
Strong year classes tend to occur more frequently, 
and recruitment tends to be larger during the 
positive phase of the PDO when the Aleutian Low 
is more intense, and SSTs are above average along 
the coast (Hollowed and Wooster 1995; Hare and 
Mantua 2000).  Recruitment is moderately to 
strongly correlated among herring populations 
within the GOA, while herring in the Bering Sea 
are distinct from other Northeast Pacific 
populations (Williams and Quinn II 2000a).  
Similar to groundfish, recruitment of most herring 
populations in the GOA and Bering Sea, with the 
exception of B.C. herring, is enhanced during 
periods with warm coastal air and SSTs (Williams 
and Quinn II 2000b).  Catches of most salmon 
species in Alaska tend to show synchronous long-
term variations and have generally been high 
during the recent warm phase of the PDO (Hare 
and Francis 1995).  In contrast, catches along the 
United States west coast have been low during the 
same period (Hare et al. 1999).  Survival rates 
among different salmon stocks in the GOA and 
Bering Sea display synchrony at regional spatial 
scales on the order of hundreds of kilometers, but 
are mainly independent at larger spatial scales 
(Peterman et al. 1998; Pyper et al. 2001; Pyper et 
al. 2002).  Survival rates of salmon stocks in 
Alaska are enhanced when coastal SSTs are warm, 
while survival rates of B.C. and Washington 
stocks tend to be reduced during warm periods 
(Mueter et al. 2002). 
 
Cluster analysis and ordination techniques indicate  
that recruitment patterns of fish stocks in the GOA 
did not cluster into very cohesive groups (Table 
A3.1 and Fig. A3.17a), and were characterized by 
a more continuous distribution in ordination space 
(not shown).  However, recruitment of Pacific 
ocean perch, thornyhead, and sockeye salmon was 
well correlated (average correlation: ρ = 0.61), 
while recruitment of halibut, chum salmon, herring 
and pollock was moderately correlated ( ρ = 0.23).  
Clustering of survival rate series for GOA stocks 
resulted in at least two cohesive groups of species 
(Table A3.1 and Fig. A3.17b).  The first group 
included three slope species (Pacific ocean perch, 
northern rockfish, and shortspine thornyhead) 
whose survival was relatively strongly correlated 
( ρ = 0.51).  Another relatively cohesive group was 
comprised of the two gadids (Pacific cod and 
pollock), two flatfish species (Pacific halibut and 
arrowtooth flounder), and two salmon species 
(pink and chum salmon).  The average correlation 
among survival rates of these species was 0.38, 
and their survival rates were uncorrelated or 
negatively correlated with those of the first group.  
In particular, arrowtooth flounder survival was 
negatively correlated with survival of all three 
species in the first group. 
 
There is evidence for strong positive covariation 
among certain groups of stocks within the GOA.  
Most notably, survival rates of pollock and cod 
were strongly correlated within the GOA.  If 
survival rates (residuals from stock-recruitment 
models) are indicative of environmental 
influences, strong covariation in survival is likely 
to reflect common environmental forcing.  Hence 
a common forcing mechanism appears to drive the 
survival of cod and pollock within the GOA.  
Recruitment and survival rates for a number of 
species in the GOA were positively correlated 
with gadid recruitment and survival, suggesting 
common environmental forcing across these 
species. 
 
A3.8 Combined Standardized Indices of 
Recruitment and Survival Rate 
 
This section provides indices of overall 
recruitment and survival rate (adjusted for spawner 
abundance) across the major commercial 
groundfish species and across major pelagic stocks 
in the GOA.  Time series of recruitment and 
spawning biomass for demersal fish stocks were 
obtained from 2002 North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council (NPFMC) Stock Assessment 
and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) reports (2002a and 
2002b).  Recruitment and spawner abundances for 
salmon stocks, grouped by region, are based on 
Peterman et al. (1998), Pyper et al. (2001, 2002), 
112 
and Mueter et al. (2002).  Herring recruitment 
series are from Williams and Quinn II (2000b). 
Survival rate (SR) indices for each stock were 
computed as residuals from a Ricker spawner-
recruit model.  A Ricker model with first-order 
autocorrelated errors was fit to each spawner-
recruit series using a generalized least-squares 
regression of log (recruits-per-spawner) on 
spawner abundance.  Each time series of 
recruitment or SR indices was standardized to 
have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 
(hence giving equal weight to each stock in the 
combined index).  Recruitment or SR series were 
lined up by year class (ocean-entry year for 
salmon), resulting in matrices of recruitment (or 
SR indices) by year, with missing values at the 
beginning and end of many series.  A combined 
standardized index of recruitment (CSI
R
) and 
survival (CSI
SR
) was then computed, following 
Boyd and Murray (2001). Briefly, all pairwise 
correlations between time series in a given data 
matrix (e.g., recruitment series for all demersal 
stocks in the GOA) are computed based on those 
years with data for all stocks.  The resulting 
correlation matrix is used to estimate annual 
means of standardized recruitment across all 
stocks.  This approach allows estimation of annual 
average indices even for years that have missing 
data for some (or most) stocks.  However, indices 
based on data for only a few stocks are highly 
uncertain.  Uncertainty in the annual estimated 
means decreases if the component series are 
highly correlated (Boyd and Murray 2001).

and standardized series of positive (filled circles) and negative (open circle) (a) recruitment and 
(b) survival anomalies for each species, 1970–2000.  For species codes see Table A3.1. 
 
The CSI
R
 suggests that recruitment of demersal 
species in the GOA have above-average 
recruitments from 1977–89, and below-average 
recruitments in the early 1970s and most of the 
1990s (Fig. A3.17).  These changes correspond to 
the regime shifts of 1977 and 1989–90.  The CSI
R
 
for pelagic stocks reflects a strong increase in 
recruitment around the 1977 ocean-entry year but 
no apparent change after 1989. 
The CSI
SR
 is more variable but shows similar 
patterns (Fig. A3.18).  A marked increase in 
survival is apparent in GOA groundfish and 
pelagic fishes in 1976 or 1977.  Survival of 
demersal stocks was relatively low in the 1990s in 
the GOA, with the exception of 1999.  However, 
the CSI is based on few stocks in the late 1990s.

two graphs;  residuals from Ricker spawner-recruit model) across demersal (graphs on left) and pelagic 
(graphs on right) stocks or stock groups in the Gulf of Alaska.  Solid bars represent years with data for all 
stocks.  Lighter shading corresponds to years with more missing stocks.  Series were truncated in 1970 
and only years with data for at least two stocks were included (figure adapted from Mueter 2003).

Summary 
 
Bering Sea 
 
The Bering Sea was subject to a change in the physical environment and an ecosystem response after 
1977, a minor influence from shifts in Arctic atmospheric circulation in the early 1990s, and persistent 
warm conditions. 
 
A major transformation, or regime shift, of the Bering Sea occurred in atmospheric conditions around 
1977, changing from a predominantly cold Arctic climate to a warmer subarctic maritime climate as part 
of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).  This shift in physical forcing was accompanied by a major re-
organization of the marine ecosystem on the Bering Sea shelf over the following decade.  Fisheries 
surveys and model calculations show a shift in the importance of pollock to the ecosystem, to over 50% of 
the energy flow at mid-trophic levels in the 1980s from near 10% in the 1950s and 1960s (Trites et al. 
1999), although biological information for the earlier period is limited and often speculative.  Weather 
data, beginning in the 1910s, and proxy data (e.g., tree rings) back to 1800 suggest that, except for a 
period in the 1930s, the Bering Sea was generally cool before 1977, with sufficient time for slow growing, 
long-lived, cold-adapted species to adjust.  Thus the last few decades appear to be a transition period for 
the Bering Sea ecosystem.  
 
A comprehensive report (NAS 1996) attributes the ecosystem re-organization toward pollock to the 
combination of fishing and the 1976 regime shift.  The report states that fishing of large whales increased 
the availability of planktonic prey, fishing on herring reduced competition, and fishing on flatfish reduced 
predation.  The modeling study of Trites et al. (1999) noted that the 400% increase in pollock biomass 
could not be explained solely by trophic interaction from these removals, and favored environmental 
shifts as an explanation.  The model showed that, once established, pollock could become a major factor 
in structuring the ecosystem. While the physical shift after 1976 was abrupt and pollock biomass 
increased rapidly, the ecosystem adjustment probably took a prolonged period, as relative biomass 
shifted within the ecosystem.  Biodiversity measures (richness and evenness) of groundfish, excluding 
pollock, decreased throughout the 1980s, and were stable in the 1990s (Hoff 2003).  Jellyfish, which 
share a common trophic level with juvenile pollock and herring, may have played a role in the ecosystem 
adjustment as their biomass increased exponentially, beginning in the early 1980s, but have crashed 
recently in 2001–03. 
 
A specific Arctic influence on the Bering Sea began in the early 1990s, as a shift in polar vortex winds 
(the Arctic Oscillation – AO) reinforced the warm Bering Sea conditions, especially promoting an earlier 
timing of spring meltback of sea ice.  Flatfish increased in the mid-1980s due to changes in larval 
advection (Wilderbuer et al. 2002), but the AO shift to weaker winds reduced these favorable conditions 
(Overland et al. 1999). 
 
Warm conditions tend to favor pelagic over benthic components of the ecosystem (Hunt et al. 2002; 
Palmer 2003).  Cold water species, i.e., Greenland turbot, Arctic cod, snow crab and a cold water 
124 
amphipod, are no longer found in abundance in the southeast Bering Sea, and the range of Pacific walrus 
is moving northward.  While it is difficult to show direct causality, the timing of the reduction in marine 
mammals suggests some loss of their traditional Arctic habitat.  Although ecological conditions appear 
mostly stable over the last decade, the warmest water column temperatures have occurred in 2001–03 on 
the southeast Bering Sea shelf, despite considerable year-to-year variability in the AO and PDO.  
 
We hypothesize that the overall climate change occurring in the Arctic, as indicated by warmer 
atmospheric and oceanic temperatures and loss of 15% of sea ice and tundra area over the previous two 
decades, is making the Bering Sea less sensitive to the intrinsic climate variability of the North Pacific.  
Indeed, when the waters off the west coast of 
the continental United States shifted to cooler 
conditions after 1998, the subarctic did not 
change (Victoria pattern), in contrast to three 
earlier PDO shifts in the twentieth century.  
Thus we project that the Bering Sea will more 
likely continue on its current warm trajectory, 
with biomes transitioning northward, allowing 
pollock a larger domain at the expense of cold- 
and ice-adapted species (Fig. A4.1), rather 
than transitioning back to a cold regime.  
Bering Sea indicators (climate and fisheries 
data) should be watched closely over the next 5 
years to confirm or reject this hypothesis. 
 
Aleutian Islands 
 
Climatic conditions vary between the east and 
west Aleutian Islands around 170°W:  to the 
west there is a long-term cooling trend in 
winter, while to the east, conditions change 
with the PDO.  This is also near the first major 
pass between the Pacific and the Bering Sea 
for currents coming from the east.  Biological 
conditions in the Aleutian Islands have 
changed since the 1980s, and it is too soon to 
discern if there was a change associated with 
the 1998 shift.  Pollock and Atka mackerel do 
not appear to vary on a decadal-scale, 
however, the biomass of pollock appears to be 
higher than it was in the 1980s.  Pacific ocean 
perch population dynamics vary on a decadal-
scale.  For example, Pacific ocean perch 
survival changed at approximate times of 
regime shifts, 1975 and 1989.  There is not 
enough information on the early life history of 
Pacific ocean perch to define a mechanism for 
the observed variations.

A4.1 Introduction 
 
In this Section we report on recent changes in the 
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands ecosystems.  Data 
on air and seawater temperatures were available 
for interpretation for the Bering Sea, and oceanic 
flow for the Aleutian Islands.  We report on 
nutrient levels, phytoplankton composition and 
zooplankton productivity for the Bering Sea.  
Information on Bering Sea invertebrates, such as 
jellyfish and crabs, is provided.  We present catch 
data for Bristol Bay sockeye salmon, and where 
available, recruitment and biomass estimates and 
growth data for the semi-pelagic Atka mackerel, 
gadids (walleye pollock and Pacific cod), flatfish 
(yellowfin sole, Greenland turbot, arrowtooth 
flounder, flathead sole, and rock sole), and the 
rockfish, Pacific ocean perch.  Where available, 
these data are presented separately for each 
ecosystem, however, some fish stocks are assessed 
as a single unit for these two combined systems.  
Also available are data on fur seals in the Pribolf 
Islands. 
 
A4.2 Bering Sea Environmental Variables 
and Physical Oceanography 
 
There is an extended climate record for the Bering 
Sea shelf based on air temperature from St. Paul 
Island (Fig. A4.2, left panel) and from sea-ice 
observations.  Monthly temperature anomalies, 
beginning in 1950, are shown relative to a 1961–
90 base period.  The primary pattern is a sharp 
transition, following 1976, from cold (blue) 
anomalies (-6°) for February–September, followed 
by warm anomalies (+4°) from January through 
April.  After 1995, spring comes early (warm 
April) although this is anticipated in earlier years: 
1989, 1990, 1993.  Starting in 2000, warm 
anomalies extend from February through 
November.  Ice concentration (percent areal 
coverage) is shown for a 1° rectangle (57°–58°N).  
The 1976 shift is clearly seen (Fig. A4.2, right 
panel);  the second dramatic reduction is the 
almost complete lack of sea ice at this latitude 
after 2000.  Nine years of depth-averaged water 
temperatures from a mooring located at a depth of 
70 m in the southeast Bering Sea (M2) show 
temperatures warmer by approximately 1.5°C for 
summers of 1998 and 2001–03 compared to earlier 
in the record (Fig. A4. 3). 
A4.3 Bering Sea Lower Trophic Levels 
 
The total production of phytoplankton is difficult 
to estimate because of its variability in time and 
space.  Observations of nutrients over the previous 
two decades show that a steady amount is 
available for production, and a steady drawdown 
by phytoplankton for the years following the 1976 
regime shift.  What has appeared to change is the 
timing and species composition due to the 
variability of the ice edge.  With greater ice 
extents, the bloom occurred in early spring, 
associated with ocean stratification due to ice melt.  
More commonly since the 1980s, is that the 
blooms are not tied spatially to the location of the 
ice, and production begins in May from 
stratification due to solar insolation.  In the last 
decade, there have been only 3 years (1995, 1997 
and 1999) over the southeastern shelf that have 
had ice associated blooms.  Particularly since 
2000, the ice extent has been relatively minimal, 
resulting in later spring phytoplankton blooms.  
 
In addition to the typical phytoplankton bloom, 
since 1997, the Bering Sea has had a series of 
large coccolithophorid blooms.  The role these 
blooms play in the food web is not well 
understood, but they have occurred in all but two 
of eight summers and are thought to be associated 
with low nutrient levels. 
 
It is hypothesized that during early ice edge 
blooms there is a miss-match with the developing 
zooplankton, so primary production sinks to the 
benthic community, while later blooms favor 
retention in the pelagic system (Hunt and Stabeno 
2002).  The inverse relation of the growth of 
pollock and yellow fin sole suggests an inverse 
relation between benthic and pelagic productivity 
on a yearly basis (Palmer 2003).  In the 
southeastern Bering Sea, physics and plankton 
production interact to determine prey levels for 
larval walleye pollock.  Some zooplankton are 
predators, however, and these have the potential to 
influence the recruitment of commercially 
harvested species by preying on the larvae or other 
early life history stages (e.g., euphausiids, 
amphipods, and jellyfish preying on the larvae and 
juveniles of pollock).

(56.8°N, 164°W) for spring and summer in different years.  From 2001–03, there were consistently warm 
temperatures compared to 9 years of record.  See Figure A4.2 for location map. 
 
 
Based on limited sampling of zooplankton from 
1954–99 from the Japanese training vessel Oshoru 
Maru, there has been no apparent long-term trend 
in zooplankton biomass on the Bering Sea shelf 
(Sugimoto and Tadokoro 1997; Napp et al. 2002).  
Research evidence does suggest, however, that 
spring biomass of shelf copepods is several times 
higher in warm years (Coyle and Pinchuk 2002).  
Temperature also appears to be a more important 
factor for zooplankton variability than 
phytoplankton availability.  
 
A4.4 Bering Sea Invertebrates 
 
Jellyfish 
The increase in abundance of jellyfish (Fig. A4.4) 
that began in the 1980s, caught as bycatch in the 
annual Bering Sea trawl survey (Brodeur et al. 
1999), did not continue in 2001–03.  The 2001–03 
levels were close to those seen in the 1980s. 
 
Benthic invertebrates 
The catch per unit effort (CPUE) of invertebrates 
(Fig. A4.5) in selected bottom trawl surveys for 
the 1980s–90s (Conners et al. 2002) shows a 
decrease from 1975–77 values.  While this decline 
is made up of a decrease in crabs, presumably due 
to fishing, and an increase in other species, one 
cannot say that there is an overall increase in 
benthic invertebrate productivity in recent 
decades.  
 
Crabs 
Crabs in the Bering Sea share similar life histories.  
After mating, female crabs carry eggs for 
approximately 1 year before they hatch, generally 
in April.  Juveniles are pelagic for approximately 
2–3 months before settling to their preferred 
benthic habitat.  Juveniles molt several times each 
year, whereas adults molt once annually or 
sometimes less frequently.   
 
A trawl survey is conducted annually in the 
eastern Bering Sea to determine the distribution 
and abundance of crab and groundfish.  Precision 
of crab abundance indices is low because crabs 
have a patchy distribution, females often prefer 
rocky, untrawlable areas, and small crabs are not 
well represented in the samples.  Crab abundance 
is generally low (Fig. A4.6), and of the seven crab 
128 
fisheries, two are open, five are closed, and four 
are considered overfished.  Rebuilding plans have 
been developed, or are under development, for the 
overfished stocks.  Total biomass of seven crab 
groups was high in 1980 and 1990, but has since 
decreased and remained low to 2002.  The trends 
in crab biomass have been attributed to fishing 
pressure, competition, predation (predators, such 
as Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), pollock 
(Theragra chalcogramma), and arrowtooth 
flounder (Atheresthes stomias), increased in the 
1980s), and environmental variables (Loher et al. 
1998).

Fig. A4.6 Total mature biomass of eastern Bering Sea crab populations.
Red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) 
Red king crabs are distributed widely in the Bering 
Sea/Aleutian Islands and the Gulf of Alaska, and 
occupy shelf waters up to 250 m depth.  Fifty 
percent of crabs mature at 120 mm (males) and 90 
mm (females).   
 
Bristol Bay red king crabs move to shallow water 
to spawn from January to June.  Females carry 
eggs for 11 months, eggs hatch in April, and 
larvae are pelagic for 2 to 3 months before settling 
to shallow, high relief habitat, and gradually 
migrating to deeper water. 
 
The mature biomass of Bristol Bay red king crab 
was highest in 1980, then declined, and has 
remained relatively low since 1983 (Fig. A4.6) 
(Stevens et al. 2002).  The total mature biomass of 
crabs has remained above 50% of the maximum 
sustainable yield (MSY) biomass and, therefore, 
the stock is not considered overfished.  The 
abundance of both legal and pre-recruit males 
increased considerably in 2002, whereas the 
number of mature females decreased slightly 
(Stevens et al. 2002).   
 
Mature biomass of Pribilof Island red king crab 
(Fig. A4.6) was well below 50% MSY in the 
1980s (Stevens et al. 2002).  Since 1991, the 
mature biomass has been higher than the 50% 
MSY, with peaks in 1993 and 2001, and is not 
considered overfished.  No change in abundance 
of large male crabs was observed, and estimates of 
both pre-recruit males and mature females are too 
imprecise to detect trends.  The fishery for Pribilof 
Island red king crab is closed because there is no 
apparent recruitment to the population, and due to 
concerns of unacceptable levels of incidental catch 
of blue king crab (Stevens et al. 2002).   
 
Blue king crab (Paralithodes platypus) 
Blue king crab populations occupy areas around 
the Pribilof Islands, St. Matthew Island, and St. 
Lawrence Island, as well as other areas in the 
North Pacific, from southeast Alaska to Japan.  
Fifty percent maturity occurs when males reach 
108 mm and females reach 96 mm.  Females have 
a biennial ovarian cycle, eggs are retained for 14 
months before they hatch, and larvae are pelagic 
for 3–4 months.   
 
Blue king crab in the Pribilof Islands area are 
considered overfished since the reproductive 
population estimate (Fig. A4.6) fell below the 50% 
MSY in 2002 (Stevens et al. 2002).  The 
abundance of legal and pre-recruit males and 
mature females decreased in 2002.  Little or no 
recruitment is apparent in the population, which 
has been at low levels since the early 1980s 
(Stevens et al. 2002). 
130 
Blue king crab in the area of St. Matthew Island 
are also considered overfished (Stevens et al. 
2002).  The population has declined steeply since 
1998 (Fig. A4.6).  Both legal and pre-recruit male 
abundance decreased.  Indices of female crab 
abundance are affected by their preference for 
inshore, rocky, and untrawlable habitat (Stevens et 
al. 2002).   
 
Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) 
Tanner crabs occupy shelf waters from Oregon to 
Kamchatka, including the eastern Bering Sea.  
Fifty percent of crabs mature when they are 110–
115 mm (males) and 80–110 mm (females) (Tyler 
and Kruse 1997).  Females carry eggs for about 1 
year after they have been fertilized, and eggs hatch 
in the spring.  Larvae are pelagic for the summer 
before settling to their preferred benthic habitat.   
 
The eastern Bering Sea tanner crab population 
(Fig. A4.6) was high in the early 1980s and from 
1988–92 (Stevens et al. 2002).  The population has 
been low since then, and currently continues to 
decrease due to low recruitment.  The mature 
biomass is below 50% MSY, therefore the stock is 
considered overfished, and the fishery has been 
closed since 1996 (Stevens et al. 2002). 
 
Snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) 
The mature biomass of eastern Bering Sea snow 
crab (Fig. A4.6) was moderate to high in the early 
1980s and from 1987–97 (Stevens et al. 2002).  
Recently, the biomass has declined and is 
currently below 50% MSY, and is considered 
overfished.  The abundance of mature females has 
declined and there has been a lack of recruitment 
to the female reproductive stock, substantiated by 
the increasing prevalence of old shelled crab.  
Small male and female crabs are also decreasing in 
abundance (Stevens et al. 2002).   
 
Hair crab (Erimacrus isenbeckii) 
The population of hair crabs in all districts has 
been declining for several years, and the fishery 
has been closed since 2000 (Stevens et al. 2002).  
Recruitment trends are unclear due to poor 
representation of small crabs in survey tows.  
A4.5 Bering Sea Fishes 
 
Pelagics 
Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka)  
Sockeye salmon are distributed throughout the 
North Pacific, from California to the Bering and 
Chukchi Seas to northern Hokkaido.  Bristol Bay, 
in the southeast Bering Sea, is a major spawning 
area of sockeye salmon.  Spawning occurs in late 
summer and fall in stream gravel.  Eggs hatch after 
5–8 months, and fry swim downstream to lakes 
where they spend one or more years growing 
before migrating to the ocean.  Sockeye salmon 
spend 1–4 years in the ocean before returning to 
their natal stream to spawn.   
 
Catch and escapement of Bristol Bay sockeye 
salmon are correlated and the sum provides a 
reasonable index of salmon abundance.  
Abundance of sockeye salmon in all areas 
increased from the mid-1970s to the 1980s (Fig. 
A4.7).  Since then, the increased abundance has 
been stable and at high levels.  Recruitment for 
most Bristol Bay sockeye salmon stocks, other 
than Kvichak, has been moderate to strong in the 
last decade.  Abundance was lower after 1996, 
however, the levels of recruitment observed for 
weak stocks during the recent period are not 
unprecedented.  Similar levels of returns per 
spawner were observed for Bristol Bay sockeye 
during the 1960s to early 1970s.  Beginning with 
the 1973 brood year (>1979 return year) of Bristol 
Bay sockeye salmon, the number of returning 
adults produced from each spawner showed a 
dramatic increase across most stocks (Fair 2003). 
However, poor returns in 1996–98 suggested a 
return to a level of productivity similar to the pre-
1978 period.  Fish from the 1996–98 return years 
reared in the ocean when temperatures were above 
average, whereas cooler than average ocean 
temperatures characterized the pre-1978 period.  
Recent ocean temperatures and returns to Bristol 
Bay in 1999 and 2000 suggest that returns in 2003 
may be more characteristic of the 1978–95 period 
(Fair 2003).

Gadids 
Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) 
Walleye pollock are semi-pelagic species and 
distributed throughout temperate and subarctic 
waters of the North Pacific (Wolotira et al. 1993).  
They represent the dominant biomass of 
groundfish in the eastern Bering Sea.  There are 
three stocks in the Bering Sea, the most abundant 
of which is the eastern Bering Sea stock (Ianelli et 
al. 2003a,b).  This stock is found on the shelf from 
Unimak Pass to the United States–Russia 
Convention line.  Pollock overwinter along the 
outer shelf and migrate to shallow waters to spawn 
in early spring in large concentrations north of 
Unimak Pass (Witherell 2000; Ianelli et al. 
2003a).  Walleye pollock in the Aleutian Islands 
region spawn in February to April (Barbeaux et al. 
2003).  When the cold pool is reduced or absent 
from the shelf, as it was in 2000–03, pollock 
distribution expands further onto the shelf (Ianelli 
et al. 2003a).  Fifty percent of females mature at 
age 4, or at about 40 cm length.  Juvenile pollock 
are pelagic zooplanktivores and are prey to many 
fish (Carlson 1995).  As pollock age, they become 
increasingly demersal and piscivorous, and can be 
cannibalistic. 
 
Recruit per spawning biomass anomalies, an 
indicator of survival, were generally positive from 
1964–82, and negative from 1983–2002 (Fig. 
A4.8).  Non-parametric Kruskal and Wallis tests 
and change-point analyses indicate that pollock 
survival did not respond to identified regime shifts 
(for example, 1977, 1989, or 1997–98), but did 
show some bi-decadal variation, with a linearly 
decreasing trend from 1964–2002.  Average 
recruit per spawner anomalies were significantly 
higher prior to 1977 than after 1998.  The major 
increase in biomass of walleye pollock is 
illustrated in Figure A4.9, following strong 
recruitment in the late 1970s.  Except for 1991–92, 
biomass has been rather stable at about 4 million 
tonnes.  
 
Increased survival has been linked to warmer 
temperatures (Quinn and Niebauer 1995; Hunt et 
al. 2002; Hunt and Stabeno 2002).  The 
“Oscillating Control Hypothesis” proposes that 
during warm regimes, the ice retreats early and 
warmer waters lead to increased zooplankton 
production resulting in increased recruitment and 
survival of pollock (Hunt et al. 2002).  
Furthermore, after several warm years and high 
recruitment, piscivorous fish abundance would 
increase and exert top-down control on forage fish, 
including juvenile pollock.  Negative average 
survival anomalies after 1998 and continued high 
relative pollock biomass may provide evidence of 
this top-down control (Fig. A4.8).

Length at age (mm)
There is an apparent 10-year periodic trend in 
pollock lengths at ages 7 and 8 years that is 
inversely related to abundance (Fig. A4.8), 
indicating that density-dependent processes may 
be important (Ianelli et al. 2003a).  Lengths-at-
ages 7 and 8 years decreased slightly during 1983–
89, and increased in the early 1990s.  The length at 
ages 4, 5, and 6 generally remained stable from 
1982–96.  The 1992 year class (dashed line in 
Figure A4.8), which had anomalously high 
recruitment, exhibited anomalously lower mean-
lengths-at-age compared to adjacent ages from 
1996–2000. 
 
Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) 
Pacific cod can be found at all depths up to 500 m 
on the upper slope and continental shelf of the 
North Pacific, from California to Norton Sound 
(Bakkala 1984).  Pacific cod are demersal fish 
which spend the winter and spring in deep waters, 
and migrate to shallower waters in the summer.  
Spawning occurs in late winter, and 50% of 
females mature at about 6.7 years of age or 67 cm 
(Thompson and Dorn 2003).  Eggs sink to the 
bottom where they are adhesive.  Juvenile Pacific 
cod consume invertebrates, and become 
piscivorous as they get larger. 
 
Pacific cod biomass peaked during 1985–88, and 
declined continually to 2001 (Fig. A4.8), with an 
upward trend in 2002 (Thompson and Dorn 2003).  
Median recruit per spawning biomass anomalies of 
Pacific cod, an index of survival, were generally 
positive from 1977–82, negative or neutral from 
1983–95, and positive from 1996–2002 (Fig. 
A4.8).  There was an insignificant step-change in 
Pacific cod survival after 1982, and there were no 
shifts associated with the 1989, or 1997/98 regime 
shifts.  The shift in survival in 1982 was associated 
with an increase in biomass but it is unknown if 
this is in response to the 1977 regime shift.  
Interestingly, Pacific cod and walleye pollock 
have similar trends in survival, suggesting they are 
influenced by similar large-scale processes.

Flatfish 
Yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera) 
Yellowfin sole are found in the North Pacific from 
British Columbia to the Chukchi Sea (Hart 1973).  
They are one of the most abundant flatfish in the 
Bering Sea and represent the largest flatfish 
fishery in U.S. waters (Wilderbuer and Nichol 
2003).  Overwintering occurs near the shelf-slope 
break, and summer feeding and spawning occur in 
shallow nearshore waters (Wilderbuer et al. 1992).  
Fifty percent of females mature at the age of 10.5 
years, or 29 cm length (Nichol 1994).  The pelagic 
eggs, larvae, and juveniles are found in shallow 
areas.  Benthic invertebrates comprise the diet of 
yellowfin sole (Livingston 1993). 
 
Yellowfin sole had an increase in spawning 
biomass following the 1976 regime shift, a stable 
population from 1985–95, and a decrease similar 
to other flatfish after this time.  Median recruit per 
spawning biomass anomalies, an index of survival, 
were positive from 1964–81 and negative from 
1982–98 (Fig. A4.9).  Change-point analyses 
indicate that there has been a significant linear 
decrease in survival from 1964 to 1998 due to the 
relatively high biomass, and a lower level of 
recruitment after 1982 relative to previous years.  
With the exception of the 1987, 1988, and 1991 
year classes, recruitment has been below average 
since 1983, resulting in a decline in the population 
(Fig. A4.9), although biomass is still high relative 
to the 1960s (Wilderbuer and Nichol 2003).  The 
structure of recruitment and biomass until the 
previous decade for yellowfin sole is different 
from other flatfishes discussed below. 
 
The lengths of 4- to 14-year-old yellowfin sole 
varied little from 1987–2002 (Fig. A4.9; 
Wilderbuer and Nichol 2003).  One of the largest 
differences in weight-at-age was between a cold 
year (1999) and a warm year (2001), which may 
indicate temperature-related metabolic differences 
rather than a difference in the population growth 
(Wilderbuer and Nichol 2003).  Growth 
differences have been attributed to interspecific 
competition rather than environmental variables 
(Williams 2003).   
Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides)  
Greenland turbot can be found from southern 
California to Alaska, but primarily in the eastern 
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (Hubbs and 
Wilimovsky 1964).  These demersal or semi-
pelagic fish occupy slope waters and migrate to 
shallower waters in the spring.  They spawn in 
winter on the slope, larvae are planktonic for 2–3 
months, and juveniles, up to the age of 4, are 
found on the continental shelf (Bulatov 1983).  
Fifty percent of females mature at the age of 9 
years, or 60 cm in length.  Greenland turbot 
flourished in the cold years of 1971–76, but 
declined steadily, since the regime shift, to a level 
of 15% (up to 1999) of its peak biomass values. 
There appears to be long-term variability in the 
population of Greenland turbot biomass, 
recruitment, and survival (Fig. A4.9).  Recruitment 
has followed a trend similar to the biomass.  
Median recruit per spawning biomass anomalies, 
an index of survival, were positive from 1972–79, 
and generally negative after 1979, with the 
exception of 6 years (Fig. A4.9).  The cause of the 
decreased recruitment may be due to predation by 
other groundfish, which increased in abundance in 
the 1980s, or due to differences in ocean 
conditions owing to the 1977 regime shift (Ianelli 
et al. 2003b). 
 
Arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias)  
Arrowtooth flounder are distributed from 
California to the Bering Sea, and can be found on 
the continental shelf at the ages of 1 to 4, after 
which they are found at depths of 100–200 m in 
shelf and slope waters (Allen and Smith 1988; 
Martin and Clausen 1995).  Spawning may occur 
between September and March, and 50% of 
females off the coast of Washington are mature at 
the age of 5, or 42 cm in length (Zimmermann 
1997; Wilderbuer and Sample 2003).  Larvae are 
planktonic for 2–3 months, and juveniles occupy 
shallow waters where they initially consume 
zooplankton and, as they grow, begin to consume 
benthic invertebrates (Wilderbuer and Sample 
2003).  After arrowtooth flounder exceed 30 cm in 
length, they are primarily piscivorous, with their 
main prey consisting of walleye pollock 
(Wilderbuer and Sample 2003).

Median R/S anomalies
 
 
 
135
The biomass of arrowtooth flounder increased 
from 1978–95, after which there was a downturn 
from 1996–98 (Fig. A4.9).  Abundance increased 
from 1983–95 due to five strong year classes: 
1980, 1983, and 1986–88 (Wilderbuer and Sample 
2003).  The survival of arrowtooth flounder 
appears to vary on a decadal scale.  Median recruit 
per spawning biomass anomalies, an index of 
survival, were positive from 1976–88, and 
negative from 1989–98 (Fig. A4.9).  Survival 
decreased significantly after the 1989 regime shift.  
Recruitment strength may be linked to wind 
direction during spring (Wilderbuer et al. 2002).  
Years of consecutive strong recruitment for 
arrowtooth flounder, as well as for other winter-
spawning flatfish (rock sole and flathead sole) in 
the 1980s, correspond to years when wind-driven 
advection of larvae to favorable inshore nursery 
grounds in Bristol Bay prevailed.  The springtime 
pattern of winds changed to an offshore direction 
during the 1990s, which coincided with below-
average recruitment (Wilderbuer et al. 2002). 
 
Flathead sole (Hippoglossus elassodon) 
Flathead sole and Bering flounder 
(Hippoglossoides robustus) are similar and 
managed as a single stock (Wolotira et al. 1993).  
Flathead sole are distributed from northern 
California to Alaska.  Adults overwinter near the 
continental shelf margin and migrate onto the 
outer shelf in spring.  Age and size at maturity are 
unknown, but spawning occurs in spring, near the 
continental margin (Walters and Wilderbuer 
1997).  Eggs are pelagic and larvae occupy 
shallow waters where they consume zooplankton.  
Adult flathead sole eat primarily benthic 
invertebrates.   
 
The biomass of flathead sole had a similar trend as 
arrowtooth flounder;  it increased from 1977–93, 
and decreased until 2000 (Fig. A4.9).  Survival of 
flathead sole appears to vary on a decadal scale.  
Median recruit per spawning biomass anomalies 
were strongly positive from 1977–87, after which 
they were negative (Fig. A4.9).  There was a 
significant decreasing linear trend in survival from 
1977–2000.  Strong recruitment of this and other 
winter-spawning flatfish species (arrowtooth 
flounder and rock sole) may be linked to wind 
direction that advects larvae to nearshore nursery 
areas during spring (Wilderbuer et al. 2002). 
Rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxstra and L. bilineata) 
Two species of rock sole are distributed from 
California to the Bering Sea in the North Pacific 
and managed as a single stock (Wolotira et al. 
1993).  These are winter-spawning demersal fish 
that overwinter at the edge of the continental shelf 
and migrate to separate summer feeding grounds 
on the shelf.  At the age of 7, 50% of female 
northern rock sole are mature (Stark and Somerton 
2002).  Eggs sink to the bottom where they are 
adhesive and, after hatching, larvae are planktonic 
for 2–3 months.  Juveniles inhabit shallow waters 
where they consume zooplankton initially, and as 
they grow, consume benthic invertebrates 
(Wilderbuer and Walters 2003). 
 
The biomass of rock sole followed a pattern 
similar to that of arrowtooth flounder and flathead 
sole (Fig. A4.9).  Rock sole biomass increased 
from 1975–95, and then decreased in 1996 and 
1997.  Median recruit per spawning anomalies 
(index of survival) were significantly higher 
(positive) during 1975–87 than during 1988–97 
(Fig. A4.9).  There was a step-change in survival 
after 1987, indicating that rock sole survival varies 
on a decadal scale.  Strong recruitment of this and 
other winter-spawning flatfish species (arrowtooth 
flounder and flathead sole) may be linked to wind 
direction that advects larvae to nearshore nursery 
areas during spring (Wilderbuer et al. 2002).   
 
In the 1980s, length-at-age of both male and 
female rock sole decreased (Fig. A4.9).  This was 
accompanied by an increased stock size, decreased 
weight-at-age for both male and female fish, and a 
westward expansion in their distribution (Walters 
and Wilderbuer 2000).  The decrease in length- 
and weight-at-age may be due to density-
dependent competition for food (Walters and 
Wilderbuer 2000; Williams 2003).  Yellowfin sole 
and Alaska plaice comprise a large proportion of 
the groundfish biomass and consume similar prey 
as that of rock sole (Walters and Wilderbuer 2000; 
Lang et al. 1995).  Competition among these fish 
species, or within the increasing stock size of rock 
sole, may have resulted in food limitation and the 
reduced size-at-age of rock sole (Walters and 
Wilderbuer 2000).

A4.6 Bering Sea Higher Trophic Levels 
 
Much has been discussed elsewhere about the 
possible causes for marine mammal declines.  For 
this report we note the coincidence of the declines 
to the 1976 regime shift and a more stable 
population at lower levels from the late 1980s 
through the 1990s, e.g., for Pribilof fur seals (Fig. 
A4.10).  The 2002 values are below the 1990s 
level.  Pacific walrus, which were often found near 
the ice edge well south of St. Lawrence Island, are 
now found more frequently in the vicinity of the 
Island.  These animals, which were certainly 
adapted to Arctic conditions over the previous 
century, may now be less adapted to current ice, 
temperature and ecological conditions.  
 
A4.7 Coherence in Bering Sea Fish Responses  
 
Based on time series of recruitment with different 
periods of overlap, cluster analysis and ordination 
techniques indicate Bering Sea stocks clustered 
into four well separated groups (Table A4.1 and 
Fig. A4.11a).  Walleye pollock and Pacific cod 
shared a similar pattern of recruitment and had the 
highest observed correlation among all pairwise 
correlations (Spearman’s rank correlation: ρ = 
0.77).  Flathead sole, arrowtooth flounder, and 
rock sole formed a second group with strong 
positive covariation (average pairwise rank 
correlation: ρ = 0.66).  A third group consisted of 
Greenland turbot, yellowfin sole, and Alaska 
plaice, whose recruitment had a rank correlation of 
0.41 on average.  Finally, the pelagic stocks 
(sockeye salmon, Pacific herring, and chum 
salmon) comprised a fourth, less cohesive group 
with an average rank correlation of 0.02.  
Recruitment was typically uncorrelated, or 
negatively correlated, among stocks in the 
different groups.

A cluster analysis of survival rate series resulted in 
three less well defined groups (Fig. A4.11b) that 
differed from those based on recruitment (Fig. 
A4.11a).  Walleye pollock and Pacific cod formed 
a relatively cohesive group with Greenland turbot, 
due to a strong correlation between cod and 
pollock survival ( ρ = 0.61), as well as a positive 
correlation between the survival of turbot and cod 
( ρ = 0.37).  A second group consisted of 
arrowtooth flounder, yellowfin sole, and rock sole,

whose survival rates had an average correlation of 
0.37, while flathead sole, Alaska plaice, and 
sockeye salmon comprised a third, moderately 
correlated group ( ρ = 0.32).  Survival rates of 
species in the first group were negatively 
correlated with those in the second group. In 
particular, there was a strong negative correlation 
between yellowfin sole survival on the one hand, 
and survival rates of pollock and cod on the other 
hand ( ρ = −0.64 and ρ = −0.61, respectively). 
 
There is evidence for strong positive covariation 
among certain groups of stocks within the Bering 
Sea.  Most notably, survival rates of pollock and 
cod were strongly correlated.  If survival rates 
(residuals from stock-recruitment models) are 
indicative of environmental influences, strong 
covariation in survival is likely to reflect common 
environmental forcing.  Hence a common forcing 
mechanism appears to drive the survival of cod 
and pollock.  In contrast to widespread positive 
covariation, there were few cases where 
recruitment or survival rates showed strong 
negative correlations.  A notable exception is the 
strong negative correlation between survival of 
yellowfin sole and survival of Pacific cod and 
walleye pollock, which may suggest that 
environmental forcing in the Bering Sea has 
opposite effects on the survival of yellowfin sole 
and gadids. 
 
A4.8 Combined Standardized Indices of Bering 
Fish Recruitment and Survival Rate 
 
This section provides indices of overall 
recruitment and survival rate (adjusted for spawner 
abundance) across the major commercial 
groundfish species, and across major pelagic 
stocks in the Bering Sea (Fig. A4.12).  Time series 
of recruitment and spawning biomass for demersal 
fish stocks were obtained from North Pacific 
Fishery Management Council (NPFMC) Stock 
Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) 
reports (2002a and 2002b). Recruitment and 
spawner abundances for salmon stocks, grouped 
by region, are based on Peterman et al. (1998), 
Pyper et al. (2001, 2002), and Mueter et al. 
(2002).  Herring recruitment series are from 
Williams and Quinn II (2000).  Survival rate (SR) 
indices for each stock were computed as residuals 
from a Ricker spawner-recruit model.  A Ricker 
model with first-order autocorrelated errors was fit 
to each spawner-recruit series using a generalized 
least-squares regression of log (recruits-per-
spawner) on spawner abundance.  Each time series 
of recruitment or SR indices was standardized to 
have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 
(hence giving equal weight to each stock in the 
combined index).  Recruitment or SR series were 
lined up by year class (ocean-entry year for 
salmon), resulting in matrices of recruitment (or 
SR indices) by year with missing values at the 
beginning and end of many series.  A combined 
standardized index of recruitment (CSI
R
) and 
survival (CSI
SR
) was then computed following 
Boyd and Murray (2001).  Briefly, all pairwise 
correlations between time series in a given data 
matrix (e.g., recruitment series for all demersal 
stocks in the Bering Sea) are computed based on 
those years with data for all stocks.  The resulting 
correlation matrix is used to estimate annual 
means of standardized recruitment across all 
stocks.  This approach allows estimation of annual 
average indices even for years that have missing 
data for some (or most) stocks.  However, indices 
based on data for only a few stocks are highly 
uncertain.  Uncertainty in the annual estimated 
means decreases if the component series are 
highly correlated (Boyd and Murray 2001).  
 
The CSI
R
 suggests that recruitment of demersal 
species in the Bering Sea was above average from 
1977–89 and below average in the early 1970s and 
most of the 1990s.  These changes correspond to 
the regime shifts of 1977 and 1989–90.  The CSI
R
 
for pelagic stocks reflects a strong increase in 
recruitment around the 1977 ocean-entry year, but 
no apparent change after 1989. 
 
The CSI
SR
 is more variable but shows similar 
patterns.  A marked increase in survival is 
apparent in Bristol Bay sockeye in 1976 or 1977.  
However, in Bering Sea groundfish stocks, no 
similar increase in survival is apparent in the late 
1970s, suggesting that the observed increase in 
recruitment was due to increases in spawner 
abundance rather than improved survival of 
recruits.  Survival of demersal stocks in the Bering 
Sea was relatively low in the 1990s, with the 
exception of the year 2000. However, the CSI is 
based on few stocks in the late 1990s.

A4.9 Aleutian Islands  
 
Physical oceanography 
The Aleutian Arc stretches approximately 3000 
km from the tip of the Alaskan Peninsula to the 
Kamchatka Peninsula.  The passes east of 170°W 
are shallow (sill depth <100 m) and narrow 
(<20 km).  West of Samalga Pass (170°), deeper 
(>400 m) passes, such as Amukta Pass and 
Amchitka Pass, occur.  West beyond the date line, 
the deepest passes (Near Strait and Kamchatka 
Strait) can be found.  In addition to variation in 
depth, the north–south width the Aleutian Arc 
narrows from east to west, with the greatest north–
south extent (>80 km) occurring east of Samalga 
Pass.  Samalga Pass also appears to be a boundary 
between water properties, temperature, and types 
of zooplankton, whales, and fish stocks.  These 
passes form a porous boundary between the North 
Pacific and the Bering Sea.  As the currents 
interact with the topography of the Aleutian Arc, 
there is an exchange of water between the North 
Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea.  The Alaskan 
Coastal Current flows through the shallow eastern 
passes (Samalga and eastward), while the Alaskan 
Stream is the source of the northward flow in the 
passes between Samalga and Near Strait.  Only at 
Kamchatka Strait is there a net southward flow.  
Strong mixing occurs in all of the passes, but 
particularly in passes of depth <200 m.  This 
introduces nutrients into the euphotic zone, thus 
supporting high productivity.  The northward flow 
through the passes provides water to the Bering 
Sea, which is an important source of nutrients, 
heat and salt for the Bering Sea ecosystem 
(Favorite 1974; Stabeno et al. 1999).  The 
magnitude of flow varies depending upon the size 
140 
of the passes, with greatest northward transport 
occurring in Near Strait, Amchitka Pass and 
Amukta Pass.  There is very little historical 
oceanographic information on this region.  Recent 
studies show that climate signals from the Pacific, 
especially changes in the Alaska Stream, can 
influence the Bering Sea as well as have a local 
response.  Slight shifts in the position of the 
Aleutian Low sea level pressure system can have 
large local impacts.  To the east of 170°W, climate 
follows the PDO, while to the west there is a long-
term trend toward colder conditions in winter. 
 
Fishes 
Gadids 
Trends in Aleutain Islands pollock are difficult to 
discern due to uncertainty in biomass estimates in 
the 1980s and recruitment estimates prior to 1990 
(Barbeaux et al. 2003).  The biomass of Aleutian 
Islands pollock increased during 1990–95 (Fig. 
A4.13).  Strong year classes of Aleutian Islands 
walleye pollock occurred in 1989 (also a strong 
year class in eastern Bering Sea pollock) and 1993 
(not a strong year class in the eastern Bering Sea).  
Although, decadal-scale patterns in recruitment are 
difficult to discern, recruitment of Aleutian Islands 
pollock is significantly correlated with that of 
Aleutian Island Atka mackerel (Barbeaux et al. 
2003).  This suggests that both species are affected 
by the same large-scale processes. 
 
Hexagrammids 
Atka mackerel are distributed from southeast 
Alaska to the eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian 
Islands, and to the east coast of the Kamchatka 
Peninsula (Wolotira et al. 1993).  These semi-
pelagic schooling fish are the most abundant 
groundfish in the Aleutian Islands.  They are 
distributed over the continental shelf, and migrate 
to shallower waters to spawn over the summer and 
fall (McDermott and Lowe 1997).  Fifty percent of 
female Atka mackerel reach maturity by the age of 
3.6 years, or 33–38 cm (McDermott and Lowe 
1997).  Females deposit eggs in nests which the 
males guard until hatching (Zolotov 1993).  
Larvae are planktonic, and juveniles recruit by the 
age of 2.  Atka mackerel consume zooplankton, 
but fish also comprise a small percentage of their 
diet.  
Atka mackerel biomass and recruitment is highly 
variable (Fig. A4.13).  The top four year classes of 
Atka mackerel occurred in 1977, 1988, 1992, and 
1998 (Lowe et al. 2003).  Atka mackerel survival, 
as measured by recruit per spawning biomass 
anomalies, does not appear to vary on a decadal 
scale.  Survival was anomalously high in 1977 and 
1988, two years that are recognized as the 
end/beginning of a new climate regime in the 
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands.  Survival indices 
within those climate regimes, however, were not 
consistently positive or negative.  Atka mackerel 
length- and weight-at-age have been found to vary 
among regions in the GOA and Aleutian Islands 
(Kimura and Ronholt 1988).  Kimura and Ronholt 
(1988) found that the weight- and length-at-age of 
Atka mackerel did not vary among years.  No 
discernable difference in length-at-age among 
years has been detected in recent data (S. Lowe, 
Alaska Fisheries Science Center, pers. comm.). 
 
Rockfishes 
Pacific ocean perch are distributed on the outer 
continental shelf and upper slope, from southern 
California to the Bering Sea (Allen and Smith 
1988).  Fifty percent of females are mature by the 
age of 7 years, or at 29 cm in length.  Pacific 
ocean perch are viviparous;  they spawn in the fall 
and females release larvae in the spring (Love et 
al. 2002).  Larvae are found in surface waters; 
juveniles settle in nearshore rocky habitats then 
move to progressively deeper waters on the shelf.  
Pacific ocean perch are long-lived fish that are 
fully recruited at age 8, and can live as long as 98 
years (Heifetz et al. 2002).  They consume 
primarily zooplankton throughout their life cycle 
but also consume myctophids in increasing 
proportions as they grow larger (Yang 2003).   
 
Pacific ocean perch biomass decreased from the 
1960s to the mid-1970s, and increased from 1978–
93, possibly due to catch rates (Fig. A4.13).  
Recruitment and survival of Pacific ocean perch 
appear to vary on decadal time scales.  Median 
recruit per spawning biomass anomalies (index of 
survival) were negative during 1960–74 (except in 
1961 and 1962), positive during 1975–88, and 
negative again during 1989–93 (Fig. A4.13).  
Recruitment followed the same temporal pattern as 
survival.  Mechanisms for this decadal-scale 
 
141
variability in recruitment and survival have not 
been identified.  Survey data from 1986–2002 
indicate that there is no apparent trend in the mean 
lengths-at-age of Aleutian Islands Pacific ocean 
perch (Fig. A4.13).  Also, little difference was 
found in Pacific ocean perch growth curves among 
years within a single area (Spencer and Ianelli 
2003), but some differences in growth parameters 
exist between areas (D. Hanselman, Auke Bay 
Laboratory, NMFS, pers. comm.).

Summary 
 
Physical and biological data were summarized for three main regions:  Sea of Okhotsk, Tsushima 
Current and Kuroshio/Oyashio Current regions, and the Yellow and East China Seas.  The response to 
the 1989 regime shift was strong for all regions of the western North Pacific, from the East China Sea 
through to the Sea of Okhotsk, including the Kuroshio/Oyashio Current region.  Winter air temperatures 
increased, which corresponded to warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs).  These conditions have 
persisted to 2003 and appear to be connected to the east–west dipole pattern observed in basin-wide SST 
variability.  A strong response to the 1998 regime shift was observed only in the Sea of Okhotsk, with an 
intensification of colder conditions and sea ice extent.  This intensification corresponded to a persistent 
increase in Sea of Okhotsk zooplankton biomass in 1999, particularly in the spring, for large-sized 
plankton such as euphausiids, amphipods, copepods and saggitas.  Changes in the epipelagic fish 
community were also evident, with Japanese sardine, previously a dominant species, being replaced by 
herring, capelin and Japanese anchovy.  Walleye pollock remained the most abundant species in the Sea 
of Ohkotsk, but the intensification of colder conditions in 1998 corresponded to a decrease in walleye 
pollock biomass.  Consistent biological responses to the 1998 shift were not evident in the other regions.  
The biomass of warmwater macro-algae in the Tsushima Current region increased when water 
temperatures increased in the late 1990s.   Zooplankton biomass in the Kuroshio Current region has 
varied since 1978, but has remained at low levels.  Conversely, zooplankton biomass in the eastern 
Yellow Sea has remained at high levels since the late 1990s.  Phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass has 
declined in the Bohai Sea, the western Yellow Sea, and the East China Sea since the early 1980s.  In both 
the Kuroshio and Tsushima Current areas, Japanese sardine began to decline in abundance around 
1988.  In contrast, Japanese anchovy, jack mackerel and Japanese common squid increased in 
abundance after 1988.  Most fish abundance and recruitment were normal in 1998, but recruitment of 
Japanese common squid and Pacific saury were extremely poor.  Groundfish species in the Yellow Sea 
have declined in abundance from the 1960s to the 1990s.  Japanese common squid have increased and 
maintained high levels since 1990s. 
 
 
A5.1 Introduction 
 
As a review of recent climate and ecosystem 
changes that have occurred in the western North 
Pacific, we present a brief report on changes in 
atmospheric processes, physical oceanography, 
lower trophic levels, and fishes in three regions: 
the Sea of Okhotsk; the Tsushima Current and the 
Kuroshio/Oyashio Current region;  and the Yellow 
and East China Seas. 
 
A5.2 Sea of Okhotsk 
 
Atmospheric influences 
As reported by Shuntov et al. (2002, 2003), the 
last part of the twentieth century can be 
characterized as a relatively cold period over the 
Far East.  Cyclic changes in atmospheric processes 
and ice conditions in the far eastern seas indicate a 
pronounced increasing trend in cold atmospheric 
circulation and in ice conditions in the Sea of 
Okhotsk (Fig. A5.1; Glebova 2002).

et al. 2002). 
Physical oceanography 
The increase in the occurrence of cold atmospheric 
conditions in 1997 decreased water temperature 
(Table A5.1), improved ice conditions (Fig. A5.2; 
Ustinova et al. 2002), and impacted areas of 
subsurface cold seawater distribution with 
temperature less than 1°C in the cold intermediate 
layer (Khen et al. 2002).  For example, the long-
term mean area of subsurface cold waters in 
spring, with temperature less than 1°C in the cold 
intermediate layer, averages 379,000 km
2
.  In 
1997, it amounted to 285,000 km
2
 but in 1999, it 
was 565,000 km
2
, and in 2002, it was 582,000 
km
2
.  The corresponding summer long-term mean 
area is 172,000 km
2
, and from 1997–2002, the area 
increased from 91,000 km
2 
(in 1997) to 228,000 
km
2
 (in 1999), and to 274,000 km
2
 (in 2002). 
 
It should be noted that such obvious trends in 
water temperature dynamics and water circulation 
were not observed in adjacent Kurile waters.  
Moreover, in some cold years typical for the Sea 
of Okhotsk, positive anomalies of water 
temperature were observed near the Kurile Islands 
(Samko and Novikov 2002).  
 
Lower trophic levels 
A time series (1984–2002) of zooplankton 
abundance indicates a decrease in biomass from 
the mid-1980s till the mid-1990s, with 
insignificant interannual fluctuations.  In 1997–98, 
zooplankton abundance was at a minimum but in 
1999, it returned to high levels (Table A5.2; 
Shuntov et al. 1998; Shuntov et al. 2002) which 
was typical for the 1980s when both fish 
productivity and total catch were very high in the 
Sea of Okhotsk.  The considerable decrease in 
nekton biomass, coupled with the increase in large 
zooplankton biomass (Table A5.2), suggests that 
fishes and squids are underexploiting plankton 
resources (Shuntov 2001; Dulepova 2002).

Fishes 
Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and 
Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) 
dominated the epipelagic fish community from the 
late 1970s to the mid-1990s.  Since the late 1990s, 
the biomass of both these species has drastically 
decreased, and fishes such as herring (Clupea 
harengus), capelin (Mallotus villosus), and 
Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) have 
increased in abundance.  Despite dramatic declines 
(Fig. A5.3), walleye pollock remain the most 
abundant epipelagic fish in the Sea of Okhotsk 
(Table A5.3; Shuntov et al. 1993; Dulepova 2002; 
Shuntov et al. 2003).  Total fish biomass remains 
below levels of the 1970s to the 1990s. 
 
There has been a significant decrease of the 
biomass of all major demersal fish species, 
excluding sculpins (cod, large and small flatfishes, 
and skates) in the Sea of Okhotsk.  The total 
demersal fishes biomass declined by 50% between 
1997 and 2000 (Shuntov et al. 2003).  Biomass of 
benthic invertebrates also decreased (to 
approximately one third), due mainly to the 
decline in crabs, shrimps, and gastropods.  
However, groups such as sea urchins and squids 
have slightly increased in abundance. 
 
A5.3 Tsushima Current Region and Kuroshio 
/Oyashio Current Region 
 
Atmospheric influences 
Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses of 
seasonal air temperature time series from 
meteorological stations distributed around the 
Tsushima Current region for winter and spring 
(Fig. A5.4) indicated that in winter, a persistent 
shift to warmer conditions was evident in the late 
1980s, and air temperature has remained at a high 
level.  There were no shifts in average winter air 
temperatures around 1976 and 1998.  In spring, 
however, a longer-term warming trend (with 
perhaps some evidence of a step-like character) 
appears, with 1998 as the first year of the most 
recent warmer stanza.

Physical oceanography 
Temperatures in the deeper parts of the Tsushima 
Current region have been increasing steadily since 
the 1930s to 1995.  The mean sea surface 
temperature (SST) has been increasing off the 
Korean Peninsula during the last 35 years (1968–
2002), at a rate of 0.2°C per decade.  Conversely, 
the temperature at 100 m depth has decreased at a 
similar rate.  In the Tsushima Current region, 
winter temperature anomalies at 50 m depth were 
generally negative from 1968–87, but have shifted 
to a positive phase since 1988.  These positive 
anomalies have continued through to 2004, 
without any remarkable change in the late 1990s 
(Ohshimo 2004).  Time series of SST and sea level 
height at three locations (43°N, 37°N, and 35°N) 
along the Japanese coast indicated a decadal 
pattern, but no apparent changes around 1998 
(Senjyu 2004).  Salinity changes seem to be 
negligible off the Korean Peninsula. 
 
Seasonal and interannual dynamics of the Oyashio 
Current, which are closely linked to climate 
change, influence the migrations and fluctuations 
of pelagic and demersal fishes in the northwestern 
Pacific. The spatial extent of the Oyashio Current 
has increased since the mid-1970s, and has 
remained in a positive phase until the present.  The 
southern tip of the Oyashio coastal intrusion 
moved north during the mid-1960s, and shifted 
south from the late 1970s to 1980s, and then 
moved north again from the mid-1990s.  The 
annual mean SST anomaly in the Oyashio Current 
area (37°–42°N, 141°–144°E) showed a similar 
change, from a positive phase to a negative phase 
in the late 1970s, and has been about zero after the 
late 1990s.  SSTs along 40°N from 130°E to 
180°E indicated a decadal pattern, with cooling 
during the late 1970s, warming in the late 1980s, 
and cooling detected during 1998–2002 
(Watanabe 2004). 
 
The Kuroshio Current often took the large 
meandering (LM) path in 1975–91, and kept the 
non-LM path from 1964–74 and 1991–2002, with 
a quasi-LM path in 1999–2001.  Time series of 
SST anomalies in the Kuroshio Current region 
south of Japan indicated a remarkable warming 
trend from 1982–99, and after (Watanabe 2004).  
The Kuroshio Current may play an important role 
in varying heat transport, which subsequently 
affects the atmosphere–ocean climate system 
(Yasuda et al. 2000).  
 
Lower trophic levels 
In the Tsushima Current region, a particularly 
early spring algal bloom occurred in 1998 when 
winds were weaker and insolation higher than in 
other years.  Delay and extended periods in spring 
algal blooms since 2002 may imply an arrival of a 
new regime since 1998, if there is a lag of several 
years.  However, it is premature to conclude this 
because 2002 and 2003 were El Niño years 
(Yamada et al. 2004). 
 
Meso-zooplankton biomass in the Oyashio Current 
region was low from the early 1950s to the mid-
1960s, increased in the late 1960s, and sustained 
high values until the late 1970s, decreasing in the 
early 1980s, and thereafter sustained low values.  
In 1999, the net primary production increased to 
the level observed in the early 1970s (Tadokoro et 
al. 2004), though there was no evidence for an 
increase in the meso-zooplankton biomass. 
 
In the Kuroshio Current region, winter biomass of 
large copepods was relatively high before the mid-
1970s, became low during 1980s and early 1990s, 
then increased from 1999 to the level observed in 
the early 1970s (Hidaka 2004).  However, 
copepod biomass in the inshore waters did not 
increase; this difference may be related to 
Kuroshio Current meandering. 
 
Invertebrates 
Although there was a significant increase in 
zooplankton abundance along the Korean 
Peninsula after 1988, it suddenly decreased from 
1997–98.  It was also a year with extremely poor 
catch per unit effort (CPUE) and catch of the 
Japanese common squid (Todarodes pacificus), 
which is the most dominant species, occupied 
around 45% of the Korean catch during the 1990s.  
However, squid had recovered to an average level 
since the late 1990s, and reached a maximum in 
1998–2000 for the winter and autumn cohorts 
(Kidokoro et al. 2004).  In general, the increase in 
squid catch has been accompanied by an increase 
in SST, as well as zooplankton biomass, since the 
late 1980s. 
152 
Fishes 
While Japanese anchovy stock in the Tsushima 
Current region increased in 1998 and declined 
after a few years, no drastic changes were 
observed for other small pelagic fishes, including 
jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus), chub 
mackerel (Scomber japonicus), spotted mackerel 
(Scomberomorus munroi), Japanese sardine and 
round herring (Etrumeus teres) (Ohshimo 2004).  
The mean trophic level of the fish community 
decreased continuously from 3.6 in the mid-1980s 
to 3.5 in the late 1990s. 
 
The reproductive success rate (recruit per 
spawners) of sardine, mackerel and Pacific saury 
(Cololabis saira) in the Kuroshio/Oyashio Current 
area decreased in the late 1990s, and recovered in 
2000, except for Pacific saury, whose CPUE 
remained below average (Yatsu and Ueno 2004).  
The Japanese common squid CPUE and catch 
were at high levels from the early 1990s, but 
suddenly dropped in 1998, with a moderate 
recovery after that (Kidokoro et al. 2004).  It was 
unclear if any changes occurred in 1998 for 
demersal fishes (Nihira 2004; Nishimura et al. 
2004). 
 
Higher trophic levels 
There were no significant changes in the diet 
composition of seabird populations on Teuri Island 
(Hokkaido) in the late 1990s, which have been 
observed since 1984. 
 
A5.4 Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China 
Sea 
 
The Bohai, Yellow, and East China Seas are 
marginal seas of the Pacific Ocean, bounded by 
the Korean Pennisula and China.  The Yellow Sea 
is a semi-enclosed shelf sea with distinct 
bathymetry, hydrography, productivity, and 
trophically-dependent populations.  Shallow, but 
rich in nutrients and resources, the Yellow Sea is 
the most favorable for coastal and offshore 
fisheries, and has well-developed multi-species 
and multi-national fisheries.  However, over the 
past several decades, many changes in 
productivity, yield biomass, species composition, 
and shift in dominance have been found.  Over-
exploitation is the principal source of changes in 
the state of the ecosystem, but natural 
environmental perturbation should be considered 
an important driving force causing changes in 
species composition and biomass yields, at least 
for pelagic species and shellfish. 
 
Atmospheric influences 
The climate system of the Yellow Sea and East 
China Sea region is strongly affected by processes 
in the Northwest Pacific Subtropical High system, 
Equatorial Current system, and the land climate 
system.  The Asian monsoon is dominant in 
summer, and the northern cold air system is 
important in winter.  Therefore, the long-term 
variation in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea is 
very complex, and we provide a brief review of 
the decadal characteristics of climate change in 
this area. 
 
Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses of 
the North Central Eastern Pacific (NCEP) monthly 
averaged sea surface air temperature (SSAT), 
available as gridded data (Fig. A5.5), characterizes 
the temporal and spatial processes in the East 
China Sea.  The first and second modes of the 
EOF explain 68.5% and 15% of variance, 
respectively.  The first mode (EOF1) shows the 
dominant variation in air temperature (Fig. A5.6). 
 
The spatial pattern of EOF1 is a simple cycle and 
illustrates that the East China Sea and Yellow Sea 
share the same climate system (Fig. A5.6).  An 
obvious low frequency variation is present in the 
EOF1 coefficients: a negative temperature 
anomaly period occurred from 1956–87;  since 
1988, a positive anomaly period has dominanted.  
A maximum anomaly was observed around 1998.  
Since then, the trend has been decreasing, and it 
appears a negative period has begun.  It is 
important to note that there has been an overall 
long-term warming trend since 1956 (Fig. A5.6). 
 
Though the monthly air temperature in Qingdao 
represents a single station, there is a high 
correlation (r = 0.69) with EOF analyses results, 
reported above, for the gridded air temperature 
dataset over the East China Sea and Yellow Sea 
region (Fig. A5.7).  This correlation is helpful 
since the meteorological record in Qingdao is 
longer than 100 years and is a more reliable 
dataset. 
 
153
A Butterworth low-pass filter was used to assess 
correlation in low frequency bands.  The improved 
correlation (r = 0.85), illustrates that the air 
temperature in Qingdao shares the same climate 
system with the whole Yellow Sea and East China 
Sea region (Fig. A5.8). 
 
The monthly SSAT in Qingdao (36°04 ′N; 
120°18 ′E) is correlated (r = 0.66) with SST in 
Qianliyan (36°16 ′N; 121°23 ′E).  A Butterworth 
low-pass filter improves the correlation to 0.89.  
The good correlation (Fig. A5.9) implies that the 
SST in the Yellow Sea is dominated by the local 
climate system.  Overall, the long-term trend of 
SST at Qianliyan Station suggests an increase in 
temperature since the late 1980s.  This positive 
trend has continued through 2003. 
 
The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index 
(available from the Japan Meteorology 
Administration), and the Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation (PDO) index (available from the 
Climate Diagnostic Center; Zhang et al. 1997), 
show patterns similar to the Qingdao air 
temperature series (Fig. A5.10).  However, the 
correlation between either ENSO or PDO with 
SSAT in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea 
region are not strong (r < 0.15).  Given the 
correlations between Qingdao air temperature, 
Qingdao SST, and EOF1 temporal coefficient of 
the SSAT in this region, the long-term change in 
the Yellow Sea and East China Sea must be 
determined by a locally dominant system.  Wang 
et al. (1998) pointed out that the air temperature 
change in China is obviously different than that of 
the global system.  The main reason is that 
temperatures around China are caused not only by 
ocean processes, but also by a land climate system.

Physical oceanography 
SST in the Yellow Sea 
There is strong evidence of a gradual increase in 
SST in the Yellow Sea since the early 1900s, with 
a recent cooling period.  Warming in the surface 
layer has been conspicuous in the Yellow Sea 
since 1989, but seawater temperature anomalies 
switched to negative values in 2000 (PICES 2004).  
For the last 35 years (1968–2002), the increase in 
temperature for surface waters and at 50 m depth 
in the Yellow Sea were 0.27°C per decade and 
0.12°C per decade, respectively (H.D. Jung, 
NFRDI, pers. comm.).   
 
SST and salinity in the East China Sea 
Sea surface temperatures in the coastal areas of the 
East China Sea have exhibited decadal-scale 
patterns:  cooler periods during the 1960s and 
1980s;  warmer periods during the 1970s and 
1990s.  A rapid increase in SST occurred in 1993, 
and temperature reached a maximum around 1998.  
The temperature increase in coastal areas was 
much higher than that in offshore areas.  
 
On the Korean side of the East China Sea, the SST 
has increased (0.23°C per decade), while 
temperature at 50 m depth has decreased (0.10°C 
per decade).  Salinity at the surface seemed to 
decrease, however, changes at 50 and 100 m depth 
were negligible.  Recently, the frequency of 
typhoons has increased over the Korean Peninsula.  
Increased typhoons, with heavy rain, and the 
construction of the Three Gorges Dam, may affect 
the regional salinity and alter the ecosystems in the 
Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. 
 
Lower trophic levels 
Phytoplankton 
Annual variation of primary productivity in the 
Bohai Sea has been observed and overall, it has 
decreased noticeably from 1982–98 (Table A5.4).  
Over the past 40 years, a declining trend in 
phytoplankton biomass has been observed, and it 
appears to be correlated with the changes in 
nutrient concentrations (Fig. A5.11).  
 
Harmful algal blooms (HABs) used to be 
uncommon in the Yellow Sea.  However, the 
frequency and extent of outbreaks have increased, 
and the bloom season of red tide organisms has 
been prolonged from summer only (prior to 1995) 
to spring through fall (since 1995).  Of particular 
note is the occurrence of the fish-killing 
dinoflagellate, Cochlodinium polykrikoides, which 
was present in October of 1998 and 1999.   
 
Increased water temperatures in the late 1990s 
may have had a severe impact on the distribution 
and composition of large algal communities in the 
eastern portion of the East China Sea.  Kiriyama et 
al. (2004) reported that large brown algae 
decreased in biomass, and warmwater species 
increased in biomass along the coast of 
northwestern Kyushu Island when temperatures 
increased, especially in the late 1990s.  They also 
demonstrated that the feeding pressure of 
herbivorous fishes increased with increasing 
temperature.

Zooplankton 
In the Bohai Sea, the dominant zooplankton 
species include Calanus sinicus, Euphausia 
pacifica, Sagitta crassa, and Themisto gracilipes, 
all of which are important food for pelagic and 
demersal fish and invertebrates.  The biomass of 
zooplankton in the Bohai Sea is lower than that of 
adjacent areas because of the influence of the 
warm current, and ranges from 5–50 mg m
–3
 in the 
north to 25–100 mg m
–3
 in the south.  The annual 
biomass of zooplankton in the Bohai Sea has 
decreased noticeably since 1959;  this is similar to 
the trend found in the East China Sea (Chen et al. 
1991).  However, there was a large increase in 
zooplankton biomass in the Bohai Sea in 1998 
(Fig. A5.12; Tang et al. 2003), possibly due to a 
decline in the anchovy stock. 
 
In the Yellow Sea, copepods (Calanus sinicus, 
Paracalanus sp., Oithona atlantica, Corycaeus 
affinis, etc.) were the major group comprising 
70.1% of the total zooplankton biomass during the 
1997–99 period.  In 1997 and 1998, the biomass 
peaked in June, but in 1999, it peaked in October.

Fishes 
The Yellow Sea is one of the most intensively 
exploited areas in the world.  With a remarkable 
increase in fishing effort and fisheries’ expansion 
in the entire Yellow Sea, large declines in biomass 
and yields of resource populations in the 
ecosystem have been demonstrated (Xia 1978; Liu 
1979; Chikuni 1985; Tang 1989, 1993; Zhang and 
Kim 1999). 
 
Hairtail (Trichiurus lepturus) and small yellow 
croaker (Pseudosciaena polyactis) were 
historically the major commercial groundfish 
species in the Yellow Sea, with catches in 1957 
reaching a maximum of about 200,000 and 64,000 
tonnes, respectively.  However, heavy exploitation 
caused the biomass of these two species to decline 
sharply since the mid-1960s.  The biomass of the 
Yellow Sea hairtail was estimated to be only 1/30 
of previous levels (Lin 1985), and this decline was 
accompanied by a substantial reduction in its 
distribution, and increase in growth rate, earlier 
maturation, and a decrease in the mean age and 
body length of adults (Mio and Shinohara 1975; 
Lee 1977; Zhao et al. 1990).   After the resources 
of small yellow croaker (P. crocea) off the Jiangsu 
coast were depleted, the biomass yield of large 
yellow croaker increased, with the annual catches 
ranging from 40,000 to 50,000 tonnes, from 1965–
75.  Due to heavy exploitation of overwintering 
stocks, the biomass decreased sharply in the early 
1980s, and spawning stock size declined to about 
1/6 of that in the 1960s.  
 
Concomittant with the decline in dominant Yellow 
Sea groundfish species, trawl surveys and 
commercial fishery information have indicated 
that the biomass of surface pelagic fish (Japanese 
anchovy, chub mackerel, Spanish mackerel 
(Scomberomorus niphonius) and horse mackerel 
(Carangoides malabaricus) increased 
continuously since the 1950s.  It appears as though 
groundfish species have been replaced by small, 
surface pelagic fishes and invertebrates within 2–3 
decades.  Recent surveys indicate that the 
abundance of Japanese anchovy is declining (Zhao 
et al. 2003), while the biomass of sandlance 
(Ammodytes hexapterus) is increasing, and the 
stock of small yellow croaker is showing signs of 
recovery. 
 
Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), chub mackerel, 
Spanish mackerel, and butterfish (Stromateidae) 
are the major, larger-sized pelagic stocks in the 
Yellow Sea.  The annual catch fluctuated widely 
from 1953–88, ranging from 30,000 to 300,000 
tonnes per year, with Pacific herring and chub 
mackerel stocks fluctuating greatly, but with 
Spanish mackerel and butterfish stocks appearing 
to be relatively constant.  Commercial use of 
Spanish mackerel stock began in the early 1960s 
when both the catch and abundance of small 
yellow croaker and hairtail decreased.  In 1964, 
the catch was 20,000 tonnes, and has peaked at 
200,000 tonnes in recent years, reflecting a steady 
increase in biomass.  The mechanisms for the 
increase are unclear.  However, Spanish mackerel 
feed on anchovy, which, as mentioned above, have 
increased in abundance.  
160 
Species shift in dominance and mechanisms 
Mean trophic levels in both the Yellow Sea and 
the East China Sea showed an overall decrease.  
The mean trophic level was approximately 4.2 in 
1959, 3.6 during the 1970s (corresponding to 
carnivores that consume small to large 
crustaceans), and approximately 3.2 by 1998.  The 
mean trophic level rapidly decreased in the Yellow 
Sea, and slowly decreased in the East China Sea.  
Overall, species diversity in the Yellow Sea has 
decreased from the early 1980s to the late 1990s.  
Thus it appears as if external stress has affected 
the self-regulatory mechanism of these 
ecosystems. 
 
As noted above, dramatic shifts in the dominant 
species of resource populations in the ecosystem 
has been observed over the past 50 years, from 
small yellow croaker and hairtail in the 1950s and 
early 1960s, to Pacific herring and chub mackerel 
in the 1970s.  These larger, higher trophic level, 
commercially important species were replaced by 
smaller, lower trophic level, pelagic, less valuable 
species (Fig. A5.13).  Although these large 
changes in biomass yield and shifts in species 
dominance are attributed principally to 
exploitation, it is not the case for all species.  
Fluctuation in recruitment of penaeid shrimp, 
which is a commercially important crustacean 
distributed in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea, 
provides a good example.  Fluctuation in 
recruitment was related to both environmental 
influences, and spawning stock size.  The relative 
importance of these two factors varied among 
years (Tang et al. 1989).  Pelagic species, such as 
Pacific herring, are generally responsive to 
environmental variability, and fluctuations in 
recruitment can be very large.  In the Yellow Sea, 
there is a long history of exploitation of Pacific 
herring and in the last century, the commercial 
fishery has experienced three peaks (ca. 1900, 
1938, and 1972), followed by periods of little or 
no catch.  Environmental variables such as 
rainfall, wind and daylight are the major factors 
affecting recruitment, and long-term changes in 
abundance may be correlated with the 36-year 
cycle of dryness/wetness oscillations in the eastern 
China (Tang 1993, 1995).
