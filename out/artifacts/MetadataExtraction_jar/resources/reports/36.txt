Preface 
 
 
Being one of the most productive marginal seas in the world, the region where sea ice is formed at the lowest 
latitudes in the World’s oceans, and the formation area of North Pacific Intermediate Water, the Okhotsk Sea 
has attracted attention of PICES scientists since the inception of the Organization.  The very first Working 
Group established by PICES in 1992 was on The Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio Region (under the Physical 
Oceanography and Climate Committee).  The final report of this Working Group 1, edited by Drs. Lynne 
Talley (U.S.A.) and Yutaka Nagata (Japan) was published as PICES Scientific Report No. 2 in 1995. 
 
Built on this activity, the first PICES Workshop on “The Okhotsk Sea and Adjacent Waters” was held on June 
19–24, 1995, in Vladivostok, Russia, and was co-convened by Drs. Yukata Nagata, Vyacheslav Lobanov 
(Russia) and Lynne Talley.  Its purpose was twofold: to promote international cooperation in discussions of 
physical oceanography, fisheries and data exchange of the region and, in view of the importance of Russian 
contributions to the understanding of the area, to facilitate the incorporation of Russian information in the 
review of past work.  A total of 144 scientists from 5 countries (Canada, Japan, Korea, Russia and U.S.A.) 
attended the workshop and presented 97 talks and 44 posters.  The workshop proceedings were published as 
PICES Scientific Report No. 6 in 1996.  In addition, the “Multilingual Nomenclature of Place and 
Oceanographic Names in the Region of the Sea of Okhotsk”, prepared by Drs. Yutaka Nagata and Vyacheslav 
Lobanov, was published as PICES Scientific Report No. 8 in 1998. 
 
The considerable interest generated from the first workshop led to a second one which took place from November 
9–12, 1998, in Nemuro, Japan, and was co-convened again by Drs. Yukata Nagata, Vyacheslav Lobanov and 
Lynne Talley.  The focus was mainly on physical oceanography, and the purpose was to exchange new 
findings and recent research results, and to review on-going and in-planning international and domestic 
projects in order to improve international cooperative research.  There were 42 participants from 3 countries 
(Japan, Russia and U.S.A.) who presented 38 talks and 10 posters.  The workshop outcome was published as 
PICES Scientific Report No. 12 in 1999. 
 
A third workshop was held on June 4–6, 2003, again in Vladivostok, and was co-convened by Drs. Vyacheslav 
Lobanov, Yukata Nagata, Stephen Riser (U.S.A.) and Sei-Ichi Saitoh (Japan).  The themes covered by this 
workshop were broadly based for the purpose of integrating physical, chemical and biological observations in 
the area.  A novel element in the program was an attempt to synthesize the major findings in a discussion 
session at the end of the presentations.  Almost 100 scientists from 3 countries (Japan, Russia and U.S.A.) 
attended the workshop and presented 38 talks and 45 posters.  The workshop results were published in PICES 
Report No. 12 in 2004, and contributed significantly to the first PICES North Pacific Status Report (PICES 
Special Publication No. 1, 2004). 
 
This report is the outcome of the fourth PICES Workshop on “The Okhotsk Sea and Adjacent Waters” held 
August 27–29, 2008, in Abashiri, Japan.  The Co-convenors and participants of the workshop hope that these 
proceedings will contribute to future marine scientific research and stimulate international cooperation in the 
region. 
 
1. Outline of the Workshop 
 
The fourth PICES Workshop on “The Okhotsk Sea and Adjacent Waters” was held on August 27–29, 2008, at 
the campus of the Tokyo University of Agriculture (TUA) in Abashiri, the southernmost city and fisheries base 
in the rim of the Okhotsk Sea.  The goal of the workshop was to develop an Okhotsk Sea component of the 
new PICES integrative science program, FUTURE (Forecasting and Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and 
viii  PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems).  The intention was to bring together a team of international 
scientists interested in the Okhotsk Sea and adjacent areas, and their marine ecosystems, to better understand the 
increasing impacts of climate change in the region, to review and exchange “what is known”, and to identify key 
scientific questions and necessary approaches to answer these questions.  Co-convenors of the workshop were 
Prof. Makoto Kashiwai (TUA) and Dr. Gennady Kantakov (Sakhalin Fisheries and Oceanographic Research 
Institute).  A total of 75 participants attended the workshop:  63 scientists (Japan 44; Russia 17; Canada 1; PICES 
1), 1 journalist and 11 auditing students (Appendices 1 and 2). 
 
The workshop began with welcome addresses by Prof. Michinari Yokohama (Dean of Faculty of Bioindustry, 
TUA) and Mr. Koji Kamada (Director of Abashiri Construction and Development Department Office, 
Hokkaido Regional Development Bureau, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism).  Then, the Co-
convenors reviewed the workshop objectives, structure and expected outcome.  Three plenary sessions (PS) 
were held on the first day and two concurrent sessions (A and B) on the second day as follows: 
Plenary Sessions: 
   PS1: Climate / Ocean dynamics 
   PS2: Amur River / Geochemical cycle 
   PS3: Primary production / Zooplankton / Marine mammals 
Concurrent Session A: 
   A1: Current dynamics 
   A2: Sea ice, watermass and freshwater processes / Coastal lagoons 
   A3: New technology 
Concurrent Session B: 
   B1: Biological processes / Marine ecosystem disturbances by oil and gas development 
   B2: Walleye pollock 
 
A total of 47 papers were presented at these sessions, including one by Dr. Skip McKinnell (Deputy Executive 
Secretary of PICES) on the status and trends of FUTURE Implementation planning.  The schedule of 
presentations is provided in Appendix 3. 
 
The third day was held in plenary to develop session reports and identify proposals for FUTURE.  The reports 
by session Co-chairs, including a brief summary of presentations and future research plans, can be found in the 
next section of the Preface.  After the announcements for the preparation of the workshop proceedings, the Co-
convenors provided closing remarks. 
 
Associated with the workshop, the fourth day was dedicated to the TUA program, the Okhotsk Practical Learning 
Open Seminar on “How can we develop resilience of ecosystem and fishery of the Okhotsk Sea against global 
warming?”.  This program was composed of (1) two keynote lectures based on the PICES workshop summaries, 
“Possible changes in oceanographic conditions of the Okhotsk Sea with global warming” by Dr. Vyacheslav 
Lobanov (Deputy Director, Pacific Oceanological Institute, Russia) and “Impacts of changes of oceanographic 
conditions and ecosystems associated with global warming on fisheries in the Okhotsk Sea” by Dr. Gennady 
Kantakov (Deputy Director, SakhNIRO, Russia); (2) two keynote reports on “Effect of the rise in summertime 
water temperature associated with global warming on the survival of the scallop fishery” by Dr. Yuji 
Nishihama (Visiting Professor, TUA) and “Influence of global warming on northern fish populations” by Prof. 
Michio J. Kishi (Hokkaido University); and (3) a panel discussion on “In order for the fisheries of the Okhotsk 
Sea to be able to tolerate severe changes due to global warming, what subjects should be addressed by marine 
sciences?” with problems posed by the leaders of fisheries cooperatives, students from a practical learning 
class on the Okhotsk Sea Rim Program, and young TUA scientists.  The citizens and fisheries people of 
Abashiri, workshop participants and students were invited to participate in this program aided by 
Russian/Japanese sequential translations.

2. Session Reports 
PS1:  Climate/Ocean dynamics (Co-chairs: Andrey Andreev and Kay-Ichiro Ohshima) 
Summary of presentations 
In this session, results of the studies concerning long-term changes of the climatic regime (Glebova et al.), sea 
ice coverage (Tachibana and Ogi; Muktepavel and Shatilina), Dense Shelf Water formation (Sasajima et al.),  
seawater temperature, salinity and chemical parameters concentrations (Ohshima et al.; Andreev) in the 
Okhotsk Sea were discussed. 
Future research should involve: 
1. Monitoring of the long-term changes of heat and moisture fluxes, wind regime and Amur River discharge 
and its influence on the water temperature, salinity stratification, circulation and ice coverage in the 
Okhotsk Sea; 
2. Organization of time-series observations and research vessel expeditions in the Okhotsk Sea to detect the 
climate change impact on physical and chemical parameters of the seawater, and a comparison with the 
results of numerical models; 
3. Study (observations and ecological models simulation) of the impact of tides on the spatio-temporal 
variations of the nutrient fluxes, chlorophyll concentrations and primary production in the Okhotsk Sea 
and Kuril Straits area. 
 
PS2:  Amur River / Geochemical cycle (Co-chairs: M. Angelica Peña and Michio J. Kishi) 
Summary of presentations 
In this session, five presentations were made including a review of the Pacific Oceanological Institute program 
on the Amur River estuary and adjacent areas (Lobanov et al.), a study of the link between biogeochemical 
cycles in the Amur River and the western subarctic Pacific, in particular the transport of iron in Okhotsk Sea 
Intermediate Water (OSIW) to the western subarctic Pacific (Nakatsuka et al.), a study of factors controlling 
biogeochemical cycles in coastal waters using a biogeochemical model (Peña), and the two papers focused on 
the effect of sea ice on nutrient fluxes (Nomura et al.) and on material fluxes (Hiwatari et al.) in the Okhotsk Sea. 
Future research should include: 
1. A joint Japan-Russia-Canada project on the Okhotsk Sea to provide information on the role of iron/OSIW 
on biogeochemical cycles; 
2. Development of a biogeochemical model embedded within a high resolution 3-D physical model to 
improve our understanding of the transport of iron and material cycles and to facilitate predictions of 
future ecosystem states, including higher trophic levels; 
3. Extended field observations to cover the full annual cycle, especially variables measured under ice in winter; 
4. Icebreaker expeditions focusing on biogeochemical studies and aiming to clarify wintertime processes. 
 
PS3:  Primary production / Zooplankton / Marine mammals (Co-chairs: Sei-Ichi Saitoh, Alexey M. 
Trukhin, Mari Kobayashi and Akihiro Shiomoto) 
Summary of presentations 
Presentations for this session were grouped into the following two classes: 
Primary production 
Prolonged high primary production in the scallop farming area (southern part of the Okhotsk Sea) was 
sustained after the spring bloom by the development of a frontal area (Cold Belt) along the Soya Warm Current 
(SWC) in summer and by forcing of the East Sakhalin Current (ESC) in autumn.  The summer bloom occurs due 
to instability of the SWC, contributing >50% of annual total primary production in the area (Muzzneena and 
x  PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
Saitoh).  In the offshore region of the southern Okhotsk Sea, the maximum concentration of chlorophyll a 
(Chl-a) was found in the surface layer in spring, but shifted to ~20 m depth in summer and autumn, forming 
the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SMC).  Seasonal variability of integrated primary production within the 
euphotic layer was low (Kasai et al.).  Although no significant relationships were found in the Okhotsk Sea 
between photosynthetic parameters and temperature or nutrients, the surface primary production during August 
and September was significantly correlated with Chl-a concentrations.  This suggests that primary production in 
summer basically depended on the biomass and not on their photosynthetic physiology or light intensity (Isada et 
al.). 
Marine mammals 
A remarkable increase in the abundance of spotted seals near northern Hokkaido has occurred, significantly 
expanding their range of inhabitation southward.  With global warming, the ice area where seal pups are born 
and spend early stages of their lives is declining, which seems to have had a negative impact on the entire 
regional population (Kobayashi et al.).  Seven species of pinnipeds inhabit the Okhotsk Sea, but the Steller sea 
lions and harbour seals are rare.  Of the14 Steller sea lion rookeries, 11 are located in the Okhotsk Sea.  The 
abundance of sea lions has stopped decreasing recently.  During the last 10 years, increasing abundances of 
northern fur seals have been observed at Tuleny Island (Terpeniya Bay) near Sakhalin (Trukhin).  Analysis of 
19 mitochondrial DNA haplotypes found in harbour porpoises near Japan indicates that this population was 
established relatively recently (Taguchi et al.). 
Future research should: 
1. Summarize and evaluate the available information on the responses of marine organisms of the Okhotsk 
Sea (from phytoplankton to marine mammals and seabirds) to variability in physical attributes of the 
ocean, such as seasonal sea ice cover, ocean temperature, stratification, and circulation; 
2. Clarify the contribution of ice-algae to the total primary production in the Okhotsk Sea; 
3. Understand the physical mechanism responsible for maintaining high primary production in the Okhotsk 
Sea (Coastal Green Belt), especially the role of advection of the SWC (Cold Belt) and upwelling zones in 
the Kuril Straits and inside the Okhotsk Sea; 
4. Improve a satellite ocean color algorithm of Chl-a and primary productivity in the Okhotsk Sea and 
develop an algorithm to determine integrated Chl-a concentration within the euphotic zone; 
5. Develop an ice thickness algorithm through remote sensing to evaluate ice thickness changes in the 
Okhotsk Sea; 
6. Examine contributions of oceanic heat on sea ice melting/freezing/motion analysis and ocean–atmosphere 
heat flux relating to ice variation in relation to marine habitat; 
7. Collect in situ bio-optical measurements of the phytoplankton community in the Okhotsk Sea; 
8. Understand detailed responses of phytoplankton to sea ice dynamics in conjunction with other 
physical/biochemical parameters (ocean circulation, mixed layer depth, light/nutrients) using a 3-D 
coupled Ice-Ocean-Ecosystem Model; 
9. Develop a plan for the study of zooplankton dynamics and population structure in the Okhotsk Sea; 
10. Promote joint Japan-Russia studies on pinnipeds and other marine mammal species in the Okhotsk Sea 
for sharing biological samples and data. 
 
A1:  Currents dynamics (Chair: Takuya Nakanowatari) 
Summary of presentations 
This session considered studies on currents dynamics in the Okhotsk Sea and North Pacific by numerical 
models and observations.  One of the presentations (Uchimoto et al.) described a model of the circulation of 
the intermediate layer in the Okhotsk Sea.  Their Ocean Global Climate Model (OGCM) reproduced features 
on the 26.8σ
θ
 surface reasonably well, despite a relatively coarse resolution.  Tracers injected at the model sea 
surface in the northwestern part of the Okhotsk Sea are transported to the Pacific via the Kuril Straits in the 
intermediate layer.  In these experiments, the tidal mixing effect was essential for the realistic simulation of 
water mass property and circulation in the Okhotsk Sea.  Using observational and hindcast data from an 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  xi 
OGCM experiment, a model was developed to successfully represent the observed multidecadal-scale cooling 
in the western North Pacific (Nakanowatari et al.).  This cooling is related to increased cross-gyre transport of 
the western boundary current.  Since the change in potential temperature originates from the western boundary, 
this indicates that the mechanism is different from the response of westward propagating Rossby waves from 
the central North Pacific, as has been previously reported by several studies  On the other hand, a linear trend 
in the Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water was not well simulated.  Vertical movements of water masses in the 
western Okhotsk Sea are evident in observational data (Kantakov).  Temperature inversions inside the 
dichothermal layer are located at convergence zones and/or close to the thermal fronts in the sea.  There are at 
least two types of convection, one connected with salt transport by the SWC in the warm months and another 
with cooling and brine rejection during fall and winter.  The characteristics of tidal and residual currents for the 
Shmidt Peninsula, Okhotsk Sea shelf of Urup and Kunashir islands were shown from observational mooring 
data (Shevchenko et al.).  The energetic characteristics of tidal and residual sea level oscillations in the 
Okhotsk Sea were also examined from satellite altimetry data (Shevchenko and Romanov).  In summary, OGCM 
experiments provide good representation of oceanic structure and currents in the Okhotsk Sea.  However, the 
interannual variations and current mesoscale structure, including tidal currents, are not simulated well by 
models.  The key components of realistic simulations of physical processes in the region involve tidal mixing 
and sea ice formation.  Incorporating feedback from observational data to a numerical model is important to 
improve the simulation of the ocean circulation in the Okhotsk Sea. 
Future research should focus on: 
1. Estimation of the effect of the multi-decadal scale change in the Oyashio on material circulation and 
ecology in the North Pacific; 
2. Realistic simulations of OSIW dynamics; 
3. Variability of the vertical movements of water masses in the Okhotsk Sea (possibly a part of FUTURE 
due to obvious impacts of those phenomena on marine biota, especially at the early ontogenetic stages), 
climate oscillations and hydrography. 
 
A2:  Sea ice, watermass and freshwater processes / Coastal lagoons (Co-chairs: Yoshihiro Tachibana and 
Anastasiya Abrosimova) 
Summary of presentations 
A study of sea-ice flow from the Okhotsk Sea through Nemuro Strait in 2008 revealed that in addition to wind 
drift, the southwestward flow of the Coastal Oyashio and Oyashio currents are important factors controlling 
sea-ice drift along the southern coast of Hokkaido and result in ice blocking of some bays (Motoi et al.).  Data 
obtained by the Hokkaido Kushiro Experimental Station indicated that outflow water from the Okhotsk Sea 
influences the eastern coastal ecosystem of Hokkaido (Nagata).  Evidence of deep convection in the Okhotsk 
Sea was found (Kashiwai).  This winter convection at the open ocean polynya can be an important process, 
along with the progress of global warming.  A study of the influence of Amur River discharge on hydrological 
conditions of the estuary area indicated that a mesoscale lens of Amur River water is formed during a spring–
summer flood (Abrosimova et al.).  Re-analysis data were used to investigate the relationship of Amur River 
discharge with vertically-integrated atmospheric horizontal moisture flux (Oshima et al.).  It was shown that 
variations in the Asian monsoon and Arctic circulation play an important role in the freshening of the Okhotsk 
Sea.  A review of the coastal lagoons of the Okhotsk Sea found high biodiversity and important species for 
mariculture (Brovko). 
Future research should concentrate on: 
1. Paths of outflow of the Okhotsk Sea water; 
2. Mechanisms and frequencies of deep convection; 
3. Dynamics, conditions of formation, and evolution of the Amur River plume; 
4. Oceanography and ecosystems of lagoons, as well as their influence on biochemical processes in adjacent 
marine areas. 
 
xii  PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
A3:  New technology (Co-chairs: Alexander Romanov and Naoto Ebuchi) 
Summary of presentations 
In this session, six reports were presented on topics ranging from HF radar (Ebuchi et al.), ionosphere 
monitoring (Romanov et al.), diagnostics for earthquakes (Romanov et al.), spectro-ellipsometry for ecological 
monitoring (Mkrtchyan et al.), radiometry for ecosystem bio-complexity assessment (Krapivin and 
Mkrtchyan), and airborne lidar for registration of fish schools and plankton (Chernook et al.). 
Future research 
1. Described technologies should be verified and improved by international cooperation under the umbrella 
of PICES, and new technologies should be developed to: (1) monitor ice-covered oceans in winter;  
(2) provide stable isotope analyses of sea water and biological samples; (3) assess biodiversity by DNA 
analyses; (4) improve remote sensing technology, and (5) create tools and methods for biological process 
studies, especially for monitoring the environment in the Okhotsk Sea. 
2. Inviting technical specialists from various fields to future Okhotsk Sea workshops should be considered 
to enhance our monitoring technologies. 
 
B1:  Biological processes/ Disturbances by oil and gas development (Co-chairs: Atsushi Yamaguchi and 
Vyacheslav S. Labay) 
Summary of presentations 
This session dealt with presentation on phytoplankton (Shimada et al.), zooplankton (Asami et al.; Yamaguchi 
et al.), river fish communities (Kanaiwa et al.) and benthos (Kashiwai and Kantakov; Samatov and Labay). 
Future research  
The following points were included in a future research plan: 
1. Remote sensing provides only the total amount of phytoplankton (pigment), but to understand spatial and 
temporal changes in phytoplankton community structure, detailed species composition is needed, 
especially for toxic species like Alexandrium tamarense; 
2. The zooplankton community in the Okhotsk Sea is classified into a coastal community (dominated by 
Pseudocalanus spp.) and open sea community (dominated by Metridia okhotensis).  Since M. okhotensis 
is the predominant component in the open part of the Okhotsk Sea, this copepod is considered a key 
species in this region.  To evaluate its quantitative role in the biogeochemical cycle in this region, its 
ecology, especially its life cycle, should be studied; 
3. Liquid natural gas (LNG), oil and gas activities on the east coast of Sakhalin Island, Magadan and 
western Kamchatka demand that the impact of such human development on marine ecosystem, especially 
benthos, should be addressed; 
4. Since the characteristics of the Okhotsk Sea differ among locations (e.g., depth, water masses, sea ice) 
affecting the spatial distribution of biota, cooperative research between Russia and Japan are needed in the 
future; 
5. Since sampling and analytical procedures vary by country, making direct comparisons difficult, 
establishing standard sampling and analytical methods for biological processes should be considered. 
 
B2:  Walleye pollock (Co-chairs: Yasunori Sakurai, Alexander Varkentin and Vladimir Kulik) 
Summary of presentations 
This session showed that despite such a long period of walleye pollock study in the Okhotsk Sea, new 
information is still emerging about its biology.  (Kulik; Ovsyannikov et al.; Yamamoto et al.).  In particular, it 
has been established recently that Okhotsk Sea waters off the northern Kuril Islands and the southwestern 
Kamchatka area is the spawning region of walleye pollock of East Kamchatka origin (Buslov and Varkentin). 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  xiii 
Future research should: 
1. Summarize and evaluate available information on the responses of marine organisms of the Okhotsk Sea 
(from phytoplankton to marine mammals and seabirds) to variability in physical attributes of the ocean, 
such as seasonal sea ice cover, ocean temperature, stratification, and circulation; 
2. Assemble existing biophysical datasets and time series from the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem to facilitate joint 
comparative studies of future climate change issues; 
3. Conduct ecosystem studies of the Okhotsk Sea every year at the same time periods and at the same area 
polygons to ensure that statistical analysis of strong and significant multivariate, canonical and other 
analyses will not lead to unacceptable biological nonsense; 
4. Improve ichthyoplankton survey methods in view of new knowledge about walleye pollock biology in the 
Okhotsk Sea waters off the northern Kuril Islands and in southwestern Kamchatka to clear up the rates 
and reasons of walleye pollock migrations to the Okhotsk Sea, and investigate in detail the hydrological 
conditions in this region; 
5. Examine interannual walleye pollock reproductive strategy changes depending on climate and food 
conditions, stock level and other factors; 
6. Explore how the extent of ice cover affects the fate of walleye pollock around the Okhotsk Sea.

Long-term changes of atmospheric centers and climate regime of the 
Okhotsk Sea in the last three decades

Abstract 
 
The thermal regime of the Okhotsk Sea is determined by the Aleutian Low and Siberian High interaction in 
winter but depends on the interaction of the Far Eastern Low and Hawaiian High in spring and summer.  These 
large-scale cyclones and anticyclones are referred to as “centers of atmosphere action”.  In the last three 
decades (1974–2007), both winter centers shifted gradually southwestward and weakened.  As a result, the 
quantity of the “cold” and “moderate–cold” types of atmospheric processes decreased, the duration of the local 
winter monsoon over the Okhotsk Sea shortened, and its activity lessened.  Hence, the thermal regime of the 
Okhotsk Sea changed towards a decrease in ice cover and an increase in sea surface temperature in spring. The 
position of the summer centers also changed.  The Far Eastern Low shifted southwestward, farther from the sea 
shore, and the Hawaiian High moved northwestward, moving nearer to the Okhotsk Sea.  In particular, the 
intensity of both atmospheric centers has increased recently.  These changes have caused a decrease in local 
summer monsoon activity, but its influence has been prolonged which means that autumn processes begin 
later.  As the result, sea surface temperature in the Okhotsk Sea in summer is increasing.  We conclude that the 
long-term reorganization of the barometric regime which occurred during the last several decades has caused a 
warming of the Okhotsk Sea climate. 
 
 
 
Introduction 
 
The Okhotsk Sea has unique hydro-meteorological 
conditions favorable for many commercial species. 
Therefore, these conditions should be revealed for 
the future estimation of Okhotsk Sea bio-
productivity. 
 
Thermal conditions in the Okhotsk Sea are closely 
connected with large-scale atmospheric processes, 
formed by the atmospheric actions centers (AAC), 
such as the Aleutian Low and Siberian High in 
winter and the Far Eastern Low and Hawaiian High 
in summer. 
 
Data and Methods 
 
The position of the AAC was determined by analysis 
of sea surface atmospheric pressure charts of 10-day 
averaging for the period 1974–2007.  A total of 1188 
averaged charts were prepared (36 charts per a year).  
Latitude, longitude and intensity of the seasonal 
AACs were determined and the atmospheric 
processes over the Okhotsk Sea were classified. The 
position and intensity of the AAC, in particular the 
Aleutian Low, and the direction of wind over the 
Okhotsk Sea were used as the main criteria for the 
definition of the synoptic types. A total of seven 
characteristic synoptic situations or types have been 
determined for the Okhotsk Sea (Glebova, 2004); 
Katz’s meridional indices of atmospheric circulation 
(as the quantitative parameter of intensity and 
direction of local wind transfer over the Okhotsk 
Sea) (Katz, 1954) were calculated as a number of 
isobars crossing latitudes inside and on the 
boundaries of the area 40–60°N, 130–160°E 
(including the Okhotsk Sea), taking into account 
their orientation. Using the formula  Im = Is – In/N, 
where Is is the number of isobars orientated from 
south to north, In is their number orientated from 
north to south,  N is the number of the crossed 
latitudes, and Im > 0 characterizes southern wind 
(summer monsoon) while Im < 0 characterizes 
northern wind (winter monsoon). 
 
Monsoon changes occur over the Okhotsk Sea in 
spring and autumn. (In spring northern winds usually 
cease by the third 10-day period of April, and in 
autumn they begin in the third 10-day period of 
September; in terms of real synoptic situations, a 
change of monsoon can occur earlier or later than 
these “average” terms.)  
  
Climate/Ocean dynamics 
4  PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
The values of all parameters were averaged for the 
cold season (October–March) and warm season 
(April–September) of each year.  Thermal conditions 
of the Okhotsk Sea were characterized by ice cover 
and sea surface temperature in spring and summer 
(obtained from http://goos.kishou.go.jp/rrtdb/usr/pub/ 
JMA/cobesst/).  To determine long-term tendencies, 
and for the best comparability of results, all 
meteorological and oceanologic parameters were 
averaged using 5-year periods. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
It is known that in winter the climatic regime and 
character of wind transfer in the Okhotsk Sea depend 
 
on the Aleutian Low and Siberian High. Their 
interaction usually forms the northern circulation 
over the entire region of the Okhotsk Sea.  
 
The analysis of long-term changes in parameters of 
both atmospheric centers has shown that during the 
last three decades their condition has gradually 
varied. As can be seen, the Aleutian Low and 
Siberian High have constantly shifted to the south 
and west (Fig. 1A–D). In addition, pressure in the 
Aleutian Low has heightened (Fig. 1E) and the 
pressure in the Siberian High has slightly lowered 
(Fig. 1F).

Climate/Ocean dynamics 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  5 
The pressure gradient between these centers has also 
decreased (Fig. 1G). It is a parameter of general 
northern circulation over the region, and its 
weakening means that the intensity of cold air 
invading the sea area has decreased. 
 
As a result of the southwestward shift (Fig. 1H), a 
wedge of the Siberian High has been removed from 
the Okhotsk Sea while a trough of the Aleutian Low, 
on the contrary, has moved closer to the sea where its 
influence has amplified in comparison with the 
Siberian High. Therefore, atmospheric processes 
directly over the Okhotsk Sea have also varied: the 
repeatability of “warm” and “moderate–warm” 
synoptic types with excessive cyclonic activity over 
the Kuriles and over the Okhotsk Sea has begun to 
increase (Fig. 2A). This implies that warm oceanic 
air masses have entered the Okhotsk Sea with 
cyclonic activity and that the quantity of the “cold” 
and “moderate-cold” atmospheric types with 
intensive northern wind transfer and intrusion of 
Arctic cold air masses have been reduced (Fig. 2B). 
The changes in the atmosphere are reflected in the 
thermal regime of the sea. The ice cover has been 
generally reduced in the last three decades (Fig. 2C). 
Although there have been interdecadal fluctuations, 
the last “wave” of heightened ice cover in the early 
2000s was much lower than the previous one in the 
early 1980s when the quantity of the “cold” and 
“moderate–cold” types was maximal.

parameters and (C) sea surface temperature in the Okhotsk 
Sea in spring.  
 
Climate change in the Okhotsk Sea is also revealed 
in the character of wind transfer. As shown in 
Figure 1G, during last 30 years a relaxation of the 
general circulation (pressure gradient) has occurred 
over Pacific region in winter. Undoubtedly, this 
event should be reflected in the character of the local 
wind transfer in the Okhotsk Sea. The intensity of 
the northern wind (a winter monsoon) in the Okhotsk 
Sea has begun to decrease too, and in recent years it 
has happened especially quickly (Fig. 3A). It is 
curious that the duration of the winter monsoon has 
also varied, namely, the termination date of northern 
transfer (and beginning of formation of southern 
transfer) has gradually moved to earlier times 
(Fig. 3B). In other words, the duration of the 
northern monsoon has been reduced and the spring 
processes have started earlier in the Okhotsk Sea. It 
is quite possible that exactly these factors — the 
lessening of the winter monsoon activity and its 
shortened duration — have been the cause of the 
increase in sea surface temperature in spring in 
various areas of the Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 3C). The 
atmospheric regime during the warm seasons has 
also undergone considerable changes. As a general 
rule, the southern overall circulation is observed in 
spring and summer as a result of the interaction 
between the Far Eastern Low and Hawaiian High. 
 
As can be seen in Fig. 4E–F, the intensity of both 
AACs have increased gradually (the pressure in the 
Far Eastern Low has lowered and the pressure in the 
Hawaiian High has heightened). Recently, the 
intensity of both centers has reached their highest 
values yet. The pressure gradient between them has 
also increased (Fig. 4G) so that the southern general 
circulation over the Pacific region has become more 
active. Both atmospheric centers have shifted 
westward (Fig. 4A and C) and simultaneously, the 
Far Eastern Low has also moved towards the south 
(Fig. 4D) and the Hawaiian High has moved toward 
the north (Fig. 4B), i.e., the Far Eastern Low has 
moved from the coast deeper into the continent, and 
its influence on the Okhotsk Sea has lessened 
(Fig. 4H). However, the Hawaiian High has steadily 
come nearer to the Okhotsk Sea, and it has had 
important consequences. On the one hand, the field 
of high pressure, prevailing over the Okhotsk Sea, is 
responsible for a considerable weakening of the local 
southern wind transfer (summer monsoon) (Fig. 5A). 
On the other hand, it is accompanied by more 
frequent sunny days and, accordingly, increasing 
radiation warming. As a result, an increase in the sea 
surface temperature has been observed in different 
areas of the Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 5B).  
 
One more important feature of a summer monsoon is 
noted — the gradual change of its end date to a later 
time (Fig. 6A) which means a delay in the formation 
of autumn processes in the Okhotsk Sea. As 
discussed above, the termination date of the northern 
transfer has shifted to an earlier time (Fig. 3B), i.e., 
in general, the duration of the warm season in the 
Okhotsk Sea has become longer, and the cold season 
has shortened (Fig. 6B).

Summary 
 
Thus, the most important changes in the atmospheric 
regime have been during the last three decades in the 
Okhotsk Sea and adjacent regions.  
In winter there has been: 
• A relaxation and southwestward shift of the 
Aleutian Low and Siberian High; 
• A weakening of the prevailing northern 
circulation over the Pacific region;  
• A reduction of the “cold” and “moderate-cold” 
synoptic situations with an intrusion of Arctic air 
masses and more frequent “warm” and 
“moderate-warm” atmospheric processes with 
cyclonic activity, causing warm oceanic air 
masses to enter the Okhotsk Sea; 
• A lessening in the intensity and duration of local 
winter monsoons;  
• A reduction of ice cover and sea surface warming 
in spring.  
 
In summer there has been: 
• An activization of the Far Eastern Low and 
Hawaiian High, especially in recent years;  
• A strengthening of the prevailing southern 
circulation over the Pacific region;  
• A southwestward shift of the Far Eastern Low 
and a northwestward shift of the Hawaiian High; 
• A weakening of the local summer monsoon over 
the Okhotsk Sea, but with an increased duration; 
• An increase in radiation warming in the Okhotsk 
Sea as the result of the Hawaiian High’s 
influence;  
• An increase in sea surface temperature in the 
Okhotsk Sea in summer. 
 
All the facts discussed above indicate a gradual 
warming of the Okhotsk Sea climate, which has 
occurred during last 3 decades on the background of 
large-scale changes of atmospheric circulation over 
the whole Pacific region.

Abstract 
 
Newly obtained observational discharge data reveal the cause of a significant negative correlation between 
Amur River discharge and Okhotsk Sea ice at multiyear timescales.  The annually integrated Arctic Oscillation 
(AO) influences both summer discharge and winter ice.  Summer discharge is larger and winter ice is reduced 
during positive AO years.  The annual AO also influences the annual horizontal moisture flux convergence in 
the river basin.  When the annual AO is positive, the annual mean air temperatures are warm over Eurasia, 
particularly over the Amur River basin and the Okhotsk Sea.  Consequently, autumn sea surface temperatures 
(SSTs) are warmer in the Okhotsk Sea.  The warmer autumn SSTs suppress ice formation during the following 
winter.  Freshwater from the river is not the main control of multiyear ice variability.  Consideration of the 
annual AO provides a new look at climate system persistence at the multi-seasonal scale.

Introduction  
 
Freshwater discharging from large rivers is an 
important factor controlling the formation of sea ice 
because it causes a large stratification that suppresses 
deep convection and promotes freezing. The Amur 
River is the fourth largest river in northern Eurasia 
and it supplies much of the freshwater to the Okhotsk 
Sea, one of the southernmost ice-covered oceans in 
the Northern Hemisphere. Atmospheric circulations 
are also important in the formation of sea ice in the 
Okhotsk Sea (e.g., Fang and Wallace, 1994; 
Tachibana et al., 1996). Yamazaki (2000) showed 
that the Okhotsk Sea ice formation is influenced by 
the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). 
Variations in Okhotsk Sea ice are therefore 
influenced by both large-scale atmospheric 
circulations and hydrological processes associated 
with the river. Ogi et al. (2001) used time series 
analyses from 1971 to 1993 to suggest that 
interannual variations in Okhotsk Sea ice were 
negatively correlated with discharge from the Amur 
River. Years with large river discharge are followed 
by suppressed sea ice formation in the Okhotsk Sea 
and vice versa. This negative correlation is counter to 
the expected influence of freshwater. Discharge data 
given by Ogi et al. (2001) ends in 1993, and this lack 
of data precludes a determination of whether the 
negative correlation is causal. In addition, the reason 
for the negative correlation is unclear.  
 
Recently, we have obtained discharge data from the 
Far Eastern Regional Hydrometeorological Research 
Institute, Russia (FERHRI), extending the discharge 
data record to 2004. These extra data and additional 
recent data are consistent with a negative correlation. 
Figure 1 shows the annual mean Amur River 
discharge and the maximum sea ice coverage in the 
Okhotsk Sea from 1971 through 2004. Clearly, 
discharge is negatively correlated with sea ice 
coverage. A 3-year moving average highlights 
multiyear timescale changes and shows a clearer 
negative correlation than at interannual timescales.  
 
This study will identify the cause of the negative 
correlation between discharge and sea ice with 
respect to long-term climate variations. The Amur 
River freezes in winter; discharge is largest in 
summer (Ogi et al., 2001, Fig. 2). Thus, the summer 
atmosphere controls the discharge. However, the 
Climate/Ocean dynamics 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  11 
Okhotsk Sea is ice-covered only in winter. The 
season-to-season connection suggests a persistence 
in the atmosphere that extends beyond one or two 
seasons. Ogi et al. (2003) showed an example of 
such seasonal atmospheric persistence by which 
summertime atmospheric circulations were 
influenced by the NAO/AO of the previous winter. 
The summer atmospheric pattern related to the 
winter NAO/AO was also characterized by a seesaw 
pattern, which is similar to the winter AO. The 
leading mode of an empirical orthogonal function 
(EOF) analysis for individual calendar months 
appears as a seesaw pattern between the Arctic and 
mid-latitudes in both summer and winter (Ogi et al., 
2004a). The winter-to-summer linkage described by 
Ogi et al. (2003) was interpreted as a preferred 
transition from one polarity of the winter AO to the 
same polarity of the summer AO. The negative 
correlation in Figure 1 may therefore be related to 
persistent atmospheric variations in winter and 
summer. The first step to solving the season-to-
season connection must consider variations in annual 
mean atmospheric patterns and their connection to 
both discharge and sea ice. This paper will show that 
the annually integrated AO influences both 
summertime discharge and wintertime sea ice. 
 
Data   
 
We obtained Amur River discharge data recorded at 
Bogorodskoye from 1971 through 2004 from  
 
FERHRI. Data from 1979 were missing, and the 
climatological mean in the present analysis was 
substituted for that year. The annual mean (January–
December) discharge data are used as the discharge 
index. Sea ice data for the Okhotsk Sea were derived 
from Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) data from 
1971 through 2004. The sea ice coverage index is the 
maximum sea ice extent in a year. Sea ice extent is 
normally largest in late February or March. 
Atmospheric data come from the NCEP/NCAR 
reanalysis data set covering 1971 to 2004 (Kistler et 
al., 2001). The AO (Thompson and Wallace, 1998) 
index from 1971 to 2004 is available from the 
Climate Prediction Center. The annual mean value 
(January–December) of the AO index is used as the 
annual AO index. The monthly mean SST data set 
includes global sea ice coverage and SST data 
(HadISST) from 1971 to 2003.  
  
The main seasons for discharge and sea ice are 
summer and winter, respectively (Tachibana et al., 
2008); thus, calendar years for comparing discharge 
and ice differ. Sea ice time series were therefore 
shifted 1 year earlier in all correlation analyses that 
consider the influence of the discharge on sea ice. In 
addition, a 3-year moving average filter was applied 
to all data analyzed in this study because the negative 
correlation in Figure 1 is more pronounced at 
multiyear timescales than at interannual timescales.

Results  
 
Annual mean large-scale atmospheric patterns that 
influence annual discharge and sea ice are presented. 
Figure 2a shows an annual mean sea level pressure 
(SLP) anomaly pattern regressed onto the annual 
discharge. A seesaw pattern occurs between a 
negative area over the Arctic Ocean and positive 
areas over the mid-latitudes. SLP patterns related to 
the sea ice variation (Fig. 2b) show a similar seesaw 
pattern but with the opposite sign. A negative 
correlation was found between the discharge and the 
sea ice, as shown in Figure 1; thus, the similar 
atmospheric large-scale patterns with opposite signs 
in Figures 2a and 2b are reasonable. Similarities in 
the atmospheric patterns indicate that the seesaw 
pattern between mid- and high latitudes influences 
both the discharge and the sea ice. The annual mean 
AO (Fig. 2c), also a seesaw pattern between mid- 
and high latitudes, is similar to the pattern in Figure 
2a and is of the opposite sign to that in Figure 2b. 
Pattern correlation coefficients poleward of 30°N for 
the discharge (Fig. 2a) and the sea ice (Fig. 2b) with 
the AO (Fig. 2c) are 0.80 and –0.82, respectively. 
Negative anomalies near the pole and positive 
anomalies at mid-latitudes are characteristic of a 
positive AO pattern (Thompson and Wallace, 1998). 
Thus, present results show that during positive AO 
years, discharge is greater and sea ice is suppressed 
in the following winter. When the annual mean 
atmospheric patterns at upper levels were regressed 
onto the discharge, the sea ice and the annual mean 
AO index resembled the surface patterns shown in 
Figure 2.  
 
The annual mean temperature anomaly at 850 hPa 
regressed onto the annual discharge shows negative 
values over the Arctic and positive values over mid-
latitudes (Fig. 2d). The regression of the annual mean 
temperature at 850 hPa onto the sea ice in the 
following winter resembles the pattern of the 
discharge regression, but with the opposite sign (see 
Figs. 2d and 2e). A prominent warm temperature 
signal at 850 hPa related to the annual AO (Fig. 2f)

covers wide areas of Eurasia with centers in both 
northern Europe and the Far East; a cold temperature 
signature covers the Arctic. Annual mean 
atmospheric temperature patterns correlated with 
both discharge and sea ice therefore resemble AO 
signatures. Thompson and Wallace (1998) noted that 
the wintertime AO is strongly coupled with surface 
air temperature fluctuations over Eurasia. Ogi et al. 
(2004a) also demonstrated that the summer air 
temperature over Eurasia is related to the summer 
AO. The annual mean AO signal in Figure 2f reflects 
the surface temperature signals over Eurasia 
throughout the year. Therefore, a positive annual AO 
causes anomalous warmth over the Amur River basin 
and the Okhotsk Sea.   
 
SSTs before the ice formation season are an 
important parameter influencing subsequent ice 
formation. The Okhotsk Sea usually starts to freeze 
in early December; thus, SST conditions during 
autumn (September–November) were considered. 
Figure 3 shows the correlation/regression 
coefficients of the autumn SST over the Okhotsk Sea 
with the discharge (a), the sea ice (b), and the annual 
AO index (c). Autumn SST anomalies show positive, 
negative and positive correlations with discharge, sea 
ice and annual AO, respectively, over the Okhotsk 
Sea. Autumn SSTs are warmer when the annual AO 
phase is positive. Such SST anomalies are consistent 
with the correlation of the annual AO with the sea ice 
because the positive annual AO causes anomalously 
warm air temperatures over the Okhotsk Sea (see 
Figure 2f). The warmer SSTs inhibit ice formation in 
the subsequent winter. 
 
Discussion and Conclusions  
 
This study investigated the negative correlation 
between Amur River discharge and Okhotsk Sea ice 
formation. The results show that the annual AO 
regulates the annual Amur River discharge. Positive 
annual AO causes anomalous horizontal moisture 
flux convergence over the Amur River basin, 
resulting in increased discharge. It should be noted 
that atmospheric patterns for the warmer half of the 
year that is correlated with the annual discharge and 
the ice are also similar to those of the AO. The 
warmer atmospheric temperatures accompanying the 
positive annual AO cause anomalously warm autumn 
SSTs in the Okhotsk Sea. The warm temperatures 
related to the annual AO are consistent with the 
warm summer temperatures given by Ogi et al. 
(2004a), which showed that anomalously warm 
Climate/Ocean dynamics 
14  PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
summer temperatures over Eurasia are closely related 
to the positive phase of the summer AO. The warm 
autumn SSTs inhibit subsequent sea ice formation. 
Yamazaki (2000) and Ogi et al. (2004b) have 
suggested that the winter NAO/AO influences 
Okhotsk Sea ice formation because of the warm 
atmospheric temperatures over Eurasia associated 
with the positive winter AO. Therefore, AO-related 
warm temperatures in autumn and winter over 
Eurasia and the Okhotsk Sea also inhibit sea ice 
formation. The presence of a strong control, that is, 
the annual AO, on both summer discharge and winter 
ice masks the influence of the freshwater supply on 
the sea ice variation at least at multiyear timescales. 
If the influence of freshwater discharge dominated, 
discharge and sea ice would be positively correlated. 
In practice, the negative correlation between the 
discharge and the sea ice arises mainly from 
variations in the annual AO. 
 
This study investigated atmospheric correlations 
between individual months and annual river 
discharge and the sea ice. However, significant AO-
like signatures, as exhibited in Figure 2, were not 
present in the maps of the individual months. It is the 
longtime integration of AO-related atmospheric 
circulations that influence both annual discharge and 
sea ice. Examinations from the perspective of the 
annual AO thus yield a new look at persistence in 
climate systems that extend beyond seasons, in 
particular for climate subsystems that have a longer 
memory than the atmosphere.   
 
Better correlations using the three-year moving 
average than without the moving average may be due 
to the following reasons. In the winter half of the 
year, precipitation over the Amur basin is in the form 
of snow, which does not melt until the following 
spring. The snowfall thus plays a role in memory 
beyond the year. Because the AO is related to the air 
temperature, the ratio between the snowfall and the 
rainfall over the basin is also related to the AO. 
Warm summer air temperature brings about a large 
amount of snowmelt, which also influences the river 
discharge.

This study demonstrated only the cause of the 
negative correlation. The next step is a detailed 
analysis of the large-scale hydrological processes 
related to the annual AO in the Amur River basin, 
and quantitative analyses of the relationship between 
autumn SST preconditioning and the winter sea ice 
formation. The present results suggest persistence in 
the AO from the previous summer to winter, which 
will be examined in future work.

Introduction 
 
It is known that North Pacific Intermediate Water 
(NPIW), characterized by a salinity minimum at 
26.8σ
θ
, is a major water mass at the intermediate 
level of the North Pacific (e.g., Reid, 1965). Figure 1 
shows the distribution of potential temperature and 
oxygen content on the 27.0 σ
θ
 isopycnal surface in the 
North Pacific. Cold, high oxygen water seems to 
originate from the Sea of Okhotsk. High 
chlorofluorocarbon concentrations (Warner et al., 
1996) also originate from the Sea of Okhotsk.  These 
distributions suggest that the ventilation source of 
intermediate water in the North Pacific, including 
NPIW, is the Sea of Okhotsk.  Since large amounts of 
sea ice are formed in the Sea of Okhotsk, the densest 
water in the North Pacific (or to be exact, the densest 
water on the surface of the North Pacific) is 
produced there.  Sinking of this dense water creates 
an overturning down to the intermediate depths in the 
North Pacific.  The Okhotsk thus plays a role as the 
pump of the North Pacific. 
 
Figure 2 shows the annual mean cumulative sea ice 
production calculated from microwave ice 
information and heat budget (Ohshima et al., 2003). 
The northwestern shelf is found to be the far highest 
ice production region in the Sea of Okhotsk. Over the 
northwestern shelf, a large amount of sea ice is 
produced due to severe winds from northeastern 
Eurasia in winter. The sea ice production leads to the 
formation of cold, oxygen-rich dense shelf water 
(DSW) with densities of up to 27.0 σ
θ
 (Shcherbina et 
al., 2003). The DSW is transported southward into 
the intermediate layer in the southern Okhotsk Sea, 
and is mixed with intermediate water coming from 
the North Pacific. This mixing forms the coldest, 
freshest and oxygen-richest water in the North 
Pacific in the density range of 26.8–27.4 σ
θ
 (Talley, 
1991), which is called Okhotsk Sea Mode Water 
(Yasuda, 1997) or Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water 
(OSIW) (Itoh et al., 2003). The signal of OSIW 
extends downward to 27.4 σ
θ
 owing to diapycnal 
mixing caused by strong tidal currents around the 
Kuril Straits (Wong et al., 1998). The OSIW 
outflows to the North Pacific through the Kuril 
Straits and then mixes with East Kamchatka Current 
Water to form the Oyashio water. The Oyashio water 
reaches the confluence of the subtropical and 
subarctic gyres, and then part of the Oyashio water 
flows northeastward as the Subarctic Current (SAC), 
bounding the subarctic gyre on the south. 
 
Warming and Oxygen Decrease Trend 
 
The results of the analyses in this section are based 
on Nakanowatari et al. (2007). For the trend 
analyses, we have used all available data for

observational data obtained by the Japan–Russia– 
 
United States international joint study of the Sea of 
Okhotsk from 1998 to 2004, data archived by the 
Japan Oceanographic Data Center, and profiling float 
data obtained by the international Argo program from 
2000 to 2004. After the quality control, a gridded 
dataset of potential temperature anomalies on 
isopycnal surfaces was then prepared for the period 
1955–2004, and one of dissolved oxygen for the 
period 1960–2004.  
 
Figure 3 shows linear trend maps of intermediate 
water temperature on the 27.0 σ
θ
 isopycnal surface for 
the past 50 years. Significant warming trends are 
observed in the northwestern North Pacific and the 
Sea of Okhotsk. The warming trend in these regions 
is most prominent at density 27.0 σ
θ
, and the largest 
warming area exists in the western part (47.5°–55°N, 
145°–147.5°E) of the Sea of Okhotsk with an 
average of 0.68°C/50-yr. The warming trend at 
27.0σ
θ
 seems to extend along the pathway of the 
OSIW (see the acceleration potential at 27.0 σ
θ
, 
indicated by green contours in Figure 3). A 
significant warming trend is observed in the Oyashio 
and SAC regions, but not in the East Kamchatka 
Current region, i.e., upstream of the Sea of Okhotsk. 
Since the intermediate water masses in the Oyashio 
and SAC regions are largely affected by the OSIW 
(Yasuda, 1997), these results indicate that the 
warming trend in the northwestern North Pacific may 
be caused by advection of warmed OSIW.

Figure 4 shows the time series of temperature and 
oxygen content anomalies at 27.0 σ
θ
, averaged over 
the Sea of Okhotsk. A positive and negative linear 
trend is the most significant feature for temperature 
and oxygen content, respectively. The temperature 
has increased by 0.62 ± 0.18°C (significant at a 99% 
confidence interval) during the past 50 years from 
1955 through 2004. A similar result is obtained by 
Itoh (2007). The oxygen has decreased by 0.58 ± 
0.34 ml/l (significant at a 95% confidence interval) 
for the past 45 years. The Oyashio and SAC regions 
also show a warming trend with the magnitude being 
about half of that for the Okhotsk and a decreasing 
trend for oxygen with a value less than that for the 
Okhotsk. The decreasing trend for oxygen in the 
Oyashio is consistent with Ono et al. (2001).

, averaged over the Sea of Okhotsk, during

errors at the 95% confidence interval for the averages. 
 
It is shown that warming and oxygen-decreasing 
trends in the intermediate water are most prominent in 
the Sea of Okhotsk. Moreover, these trends appear to 
extend to the northwestern North Pacific along the 
pathway of the water mass originating from the Sea of 
Okhotsk. These facts suggest that the trends in the 
northwestern North Pacific are due to preceding 
changes of water-mass properties in the Sea of 
Okhotsk. Intermediate water in the Sea of Okhotsk 
retains its cold and oxygen-rich properties by mixing 
with dense shelf water (DSW) associated with sea ice 
production in the coastal polynya of the northwestern 
shelf. The largest warming trend occurs in the western 
part of the Sea of Okhotsk (Fig. 3), to which DSW is 
transported from the northwestern shelf (Fukamachi et 
al., 2004). Therefore, we suppose that the main cause 
of the warming and oxygen-decreasing trends is the 
weakening of DSW production. 
 
Global Warming and the Sea of Okhotsk 
 
DSW formation is caused by sea ice production. 
Thus we examine the change of the sea ice extent or 
production in the Sea of Okhotsk. Over the last three 
decades since accurate observation by satellite 
became possible, sea ice extent in the Sea of Okhotsk 
has decreased by approximately 150,000 km
2
, 
corresponding to about 10% of the entire area of the 
Sea of Okhotsk (blue line in Fig. 5). It has been also 
revealed that yearly variability of sea ice extent in 
the Sea of Okhotsk is highly correlated with that of 
surface air temperatures in the upwind region of the 
Okhotsk (red line in Fig. 5). Of particular note is that 
this temperature has risen by approximately 2.0°C 
over the past 50 years (2.0 ± 1.4°C/50-yr, significant 
at a 99% confidence level). This value far exceeds 
the rate of average temperature increase worldwide 
(0.74°C over the past 100 years), thereby clearly 
indicating that the region is significantly affected by 
global warming. The correlation between this 
temperature and the sea ice extent (r = –0.61, 
significant at a 95% confidence level) suggests that 
decreases in the sea ice preceded the beginning of 
satellite observations.

inverted (the axis on the right). Surface air temperatures

Although satellite measurements have been available 
only since the 1970s, visual observations at the 
Hokkaido coast, located on the southern boundary of 
sea ice extent in the Sea of Okhotsk, show the 
decreasing trend in the length of the sea ice season 
during the past 100 years (Aota, 1999). These trends 
of air temperature and sea ice season suggest that sea 
ice extent, accordingly sea ice production, has likely 
decreased during the past 50 years. During the 
current global warming, the surface air temperature 
anomaly in autumn and winter is particularly large 
over northeastern Eurasia (Serreze et al., 2000). The 
DSW production area of the northwestern shelf in the 
Sea of Okhotsk is located where the winter monsoon 
from northeastern Eurasia directly transports cold air 
masses. Therefore, intermediate water in the Sea of 
Okhotsk, which is ventilated through DSW, may be 
sensitive to the global warming. 
 
Possible Scenario 
 
In a nutshell, the Sea of Okhotsk is highly sensitive 
to global warming: over the past 50 years, the level 
of sea ice production has decreased and the amount 
of dense water sinking has thus declined, thereby 
weakening the overturning in the North Pacific scale. 
To put it simply, the recent global warming has 
weakened the Sea of Okhotsk’s workings as a pump. 
 
Recent studies suggest that OSIW has a significant 
role in material circulation of the intermediate layer 
in the North Pacific. Hansell et al. (2002) indicated 
that dissolved organic carbons in NPIW originate 
from the Sea of Okhotsk. Nakatsuka et al. (2004) 
showed that large amounts of dissolved and 
particulate organic carbons are exported from the 
highly productive northwestern shelf into the 
intermediate layer in the Sea of Okhotsk through the 
outflow of DSW. Moreover, recent observational 
data show that in the northwestern North Pacific, 
iron may come from the intermediate water of the 
Sea of Okhotsk (Nishioka et al., 2007). Iron is an 
essential micronutrient for phytoplankton and is thus 
considered an important factor in determining 
biological productivity. It has been recently revealed 
that when dense shelf water sinks to the intermediate 
layer in the Sea of Okhotsk, iron is also brought to 
this layer. We hypothesize that this iron is also 
supplied to the western area of the North Pacific and 
supports high biological productivity there. If that is 
the case, it is also suggested that if global warming 
weakens sea ice production in the Sea of Okhotsk, 
iron supplies will decrease in the North Pacific as 
well as in the Sea of Okhotsk, thus reducing levels of 
biological productivity and fishery resources. 
 
Figure 6 summarizes our proposal with schematics. 
Because the Sea of Okhotsk is an area sensitive to 
the current global warming, it has experienced a 
decrease in the production of sea ice and dense shelf 
water in the northwestern shelf during the past 50 
years. This possibly causes a decrease in the supply 
of iron in the intermediate layer in the Sea of 
Okhotsk and further in the North Pacific. Finally, this 
might induce the decrease in primary biological 
production, fishery resources, and capacity of CO
2
 
absorption.

Introduction 
 
The Okhotsk Sea is one of the marginal seas of the 
North Pacific Ocean, and is bounded by the 
Kamchatka Peninsula, Siberia, Sakhalin Island, 
Hokkaido and the Kuril Islands.  It is connected with 
the Japan Sea through the La Perouse (Soya) and 
Tartar Straits and with the Pacific Ocean through the 
Kuril Island Chain.  The physical and chemical 
parameters in the intermediate waters of the Okhotsk 
Sea are determined by the supply of the Dense Shelf 
Water (formed in the coastal polynyas as result of 
cooling and brine injection under ice), the inflow of 
dense transformed subtropical waters from the Japan 
Sea in spring through La Perouse Strait, and the 
water exchange between the Okhotsk Sea and the 
subarctic Pacific.  The increase/decrease in water 
exchange between the subarctic Pacific and the 
Okhotsk Sea and the decrease/increase in the supply 
of Dense Shelf Water (DSW) result in the 
decrease/increase in dissolved oxygen (DO) and 
increase/decrease in temperature, dissolved inorganic 
carbon (DIC) and nutrients in intermediate waters of 
the Okhotsk Sea (Andreev and Zhabin, 2000; 
Andreev and Kusakabe, 2001; Andreev and Baturina, 
2005).  
 
Andreev and Baturina (2005) have shown that 
between 1948 and 2000 in the Kuril Basin of the 
Okhotsk Sea there is an average increase in isopycnal 
depth (H) of 26.8σ
θ
 and 27.0σ
θ
 with a rate of 2.0 ± 
0.9 m yr
–1 
and 1.4 ± 1.0 m yr
–1
, respectively. At σ
θ
= 
27.0 the increase in H coincides with an increased 
temperature (0.010 ± 0.004°C yr
–1
). The interdecadal 
variations and trend in DO show a good correlation 
with the intensity of the Aleutian Low pressure cell, 
represented by the North Pacific Index in winter 
(Andreev and Kusakabe, 2001).  In the intermediate 
water layer of the Kuril Basin (σ
θ 
= 26.8 and σ
θ 
= 
27.0) there is an average decrease in the DO 
concentration at a rate of  –0.9 ± 0.4 µmol kg
–1
 yr
–1 
(Andreev and Baturina, 2005).  The interannual 
variations in the DO, DIC and temperature in the 
Kuril Basin area could be explained by the variations 
in the Alaska Gyre intermediate waters supply (by 
the Alaskan Stream and East-Kamchatka Currents) to 
the western subarctic Pacific (Andreev and Baturina, 
2005).  In addition to the water exchange between 
the subarctic Pacific and Okhotsk Sea, the variations 
in the formation and transport rates of the DSW (by 
the East-Sakhalin Current) probably can generate the 
interannual DO and temperature signals observed in 
the Kuril Basin region of the Okhotsk Sea.   
 
In this study we investigate the interannual variations 
in the East-Kamchatka and Oyashio Currents 
(EKC/Oyashio) and East-Sakhalin Current (ESC) 
volume transports and their impact on temperature 
and chemical parameters in the Kuril Basin of the 
Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 1).  We demonstrate that there is a 
strong correlation between the interannual changes of 
EKC/Oyashio and ESC transport rates computed by 
using the Sverdrup relation and the temporal 
variations in the sea level at coastal stations in 
winter.  The variations in EKC/Oyashio volume 
transport are responsible for the observed 
temperature and DO interannual changes in the 
intermediate waters of the Okhotsk Sea. 
 
Data and Methods 
 
To analyze the temporal changes of temperature and 
chemical parameters in the intermediate waters of the 
Okhotsk Sea, the data sets of the NOAA 
Oceanographic Data Center, Japan Oceanographic 
Data Center, Institute of Ocean Sciences (Line P 
oceanographic data) and the Pacific Oceanological 
Institute were used. Sverdrup volume transports in 
the Okhotsk Sea and subarctic Pacific were 
calculated from the wind stress data provided by the 
NOAA-CIRES Climate Diagnostic Center 
NCEP/NCAR (National Centers for Environmental 
Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric 
Research) Reanalysis Project. The sea level 
measurements at the coastal stations of the

Kuril (Severo-Kurilsk) and Sakhalin (Vzmorie)

Meteorological Agency. Sea level data were 
corrected for the variations in atmospheric pressure. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
East-Kamchatka/Oyashio and East-Sakhalin 
currents volume transports 
 
Positive wind stress curls over the northern North 
Pacific and Okhotsk Sea in winter, determined by the 
strength and position of the Aleutian Low and 
Siberian High, force the cyclonic circulations in 
these basins.  The ESC and EKC/Oyashio currents 
are the western boundary currents of the wind-driven 
cyclonic gyres in the Okhotsk Sea and the northern 
North Pacific, respectively.  Spin up/down of the 
cyclonic gyres in the Okhotsk Sea and subarctic 
Pacific driven by the wind stress curl results in the 
increased/decreased ESC and EKC/Oyashio volume 
transports and increase/decrease in sea level at the 
 
coastal stations of the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands and 
Kamchatka Peninsula.   
 
The interannual variations in the volume transports of 
the EKC/Oyashio and ESC calculated by the Sverdrup 
relation show a good correlation with the change in 
sea level at the coastal stations of Kamchatka 
Peninsula, Kuril Islands and Sakhalin Island in winter 
(Fig. 2, Andreev and Shevchenko, 2008).  The cross-
correlation coefficients between the volume transport 
of the EKC/Oyashio and the sea level at Stns. 
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky (1965–2002) and Severo-
Kurilsk (1968–1995) are equal to 0.69 and 0.60, 
respectively. The cross-correlation coefficient between 
the volume transport of the ESC and the sea level at 
Stn. Vzmorie (1952–1988) is 0.72. 
 
The wide northern shelf can interrupt the Sverdrup 
balance in the Okhotsk Sea and significantly reduce the 
wind-driven volume transport of the ESC due to bottom 
friction (Simizu and Ohshima, 2006). In our study, the 
change in EKC Sverdrup transport driven by bottom 
friction over the shelf is not taken into consideration.

There is no statistically significant correlation (r =  
–0.10) between the interannual variations in the 
EKC/Oyashio volume transport and the ESC volume 
transport for a 60-year period (1949–2008). Such a 
correlation was observed during brief (10–20 years) 
periods determined by the strength and position of 
the Aleutian Low and Siberian High in winter. 
Between 1950 and 1960 the spinup of the cyclonic 
circulation in the subarctic North Pacific (and an 
increased transport of the EKC/Oyashio) was 
accompanied by a slowdown of the ESC transport. 
Between 1977 and 1998 the increased/decreased 
ESC transport corresponded to the increased/ 
decreased EKC/Oyashio transport (Fig. 2c).

 isopycnals in the 
Kuril Basin of the Okhotsk Sea between 1950 and 
1995 can be described by a linear combination of the 
EKC/Oyashio and ESC volume transports (Figs. 3a, 
b and c).

and DO on the 26.8σ

 and 27.0σ

 isopycnals  are 
0.71, 0.65, –0.54 and –0.66, respectively. An 
intensification of the subarctic cyclone gyre (and an 
increase of the EKC/Oyashio volume transport)  
decreases the residence time of the Alaskan waters at 
the northern boundary, and therefore, the 
intermediate and surface waters become less 
modified (by cooling and tidal mixing) while they 
move off the Aleutian Islands and Kamchatka coast. 
This leads to an increased temperature and decreased 
DO, and deepening of isopycnals in the Okhotsk Sea. 
The deepening of the isopycnals, driven by the 
increased EKC/Oyashio volume transport is probably 
related to an excess supply of eastern subarctic 
surface waters ( σ
t 
~ 25.5–26.0).

isopycnals in the Kuril Basin, can be due partly to 
changes of the DSW formation rate forced by 
northwest winds in winter. 
  
There are significant discrepancies between the 
calculated (using the volume transports of ESC and 
EKC/Oyashio) and the observed temperature and DO 
in 2000, 2003 and 2004 years (Fig. 3). These 
discrepancies reflect the changes in DO and 
temperature of the upstream region (Alaska Gyre 
area) (Andreev and Baturina, 2006). The 
intermediate waters of the Alaska Gyre are impacted 
by a huge (low oxygen and high temperature) eastern 
subtropical pool (Andreev and Baturina, 2006). The 
eastern subtropical waters are transported northward 
by the California undercurrent and then by the 
Alaska Current and Alaskan Stream Current into the 
western subarctic Pacific and Okhotsk Sea. The 
temporal variations in DO and temperature in the 
Alaska Gyre area show a good correlation with the 
intensity of the Aleutian Low pressure cell, 
represented by the North Pacific Index (an averaged 
sea-level atmospheric pressure in the northern North 
Pacific in winter (Andreev and Baturina, 2006).  
Intensification of the Aleutian Low results in the 
increased northward meridional wind stress at its 
eastern boundary and enhanced transport of low 
oxygen eastern subtropical waters into the subarctic 
region.  Figure 3d shows the interannual variations in 
the difference in DO concentration between the 
Okhotsk Sea and Alaska Gyre waters ( ∆DO
OS-AG
). 
The intensification of the EKC/Oyashio decreases 
∆DO
OS-AG
 while enhanced ESC volume transport 
leads to the increased ∆DO
OS-AG
. 
 
In addition to the DO, the routine oceanographic 
observations include the measurements of nutrients 
and DIC. Comparison of the differences in chemical 
parameters between the Okhotsk Sea (Kuril Basin 
region) and Alaska Gyre and the accuracy of its 
measurements (Table 1) shows that the DO is the 
best parameter to study the impact of northeastern 
Pacific waters on the western subarctic Pacific and 
Okhotsk Sea.

Impact of the Bering Sea  
 
The observed temperature and DO changes in the 
Okhotsk Sea waters can be related to Alaskan water 
modification in the Bering Sea (Andreev and 
Watanabe, 2002).  Due to a strong halocline, the salt 
supply into the surface layer is the necessary 
component for subarctic North Pacific intermediate 
water ventilation. In the Bering Sea it can be added 
to seawater as brine during ice formation in the 
northern and western shelf areas. Interaction of the 
Bering Slope Current water with the DSW formed in 
the Bering Sea in winter can enhance the 
intermediate waters of the EKC with DO.  Another 
source of salt for the surface layer of the Bering Sea 
is an advection of the more saline water from low 
latitude areas through the straits of the Aleutian 
Islands.  Intensification of the Western Subarctic 
Gyre in the 1950s increased meridional transport of 
saline water from low to high latitudes in the central 
North Pacific, thereby triggering the formation of 
dense water and intermediate layer ventilation in the 
Bering Sea.  During this period the EKC waters were 
a source of low temperature and high oxygen waters 
for the intermediate layer of the Okhotsk Sea 
(Andreev and Watanabe, 2002; Andreev and 
Baturina, 2006). 
 
Impact of the Japan Sea 
 
The Okhotsk Sea is connected to the Japan Sea 
through La Perouse (Soya) Strait. Warm saline 
water, originating from the Tsushima Warm Current 
in the Japan Sea, flows into the Okhotsk Sea and 
forms the Soya Current flowing southeastward along 
the coast of Hokkaido. Japan Sea surface and 
subsurface waters are significantly impacted by East 
China Sea (ECS) shelf waters. Our results suggest 
that the variations in the transport rate of the ECS 
subsurface (low oxygen and relatively high nutrients) 
waters in summer and fall are responsible for the 
interannual change of the DO in the intermediate 
waters of the Japan Sea (Andreev, 2008). Human 
impact on the Yangtze River waters leads to the 
increase of N* ([NO
3
–
] –16 ⋅ [PO
4
3–
]) concentrations 
in the upper waters of the Tsushima Current 
(Andreev, 2009), and probably the Soya Current.  
 
Future study should clarify how changes in the 
chemical parameters of the surface and subsurface 
waters in the Japan Sea (driven by changes in the 
water transport through the Tsushima Strait and the 
human impact on the East China Sea waters) affect 
the biology and chemistry of the Okhotsk Sea waters.  
 
 Summary 
 
The impact of the interannual variations in East-
Kamchatka and Oyashio Currents (EKC/Oyashio) 
and East-Sakhalin Current (ESC) volume transports 
on temperature and chemical parameters in the Kuril 
Basin of the Okhotsk Sea was analyzed. It is shown 
that there is a strong correlation between the 
interannual variations in EKC/Oyashio and ESC 
Sverdrup transport and the temporal changes of the 
sea level at the coastal stations of the Kamchatka 
Peninsula, and Kuril and Sakhalin islands in winter. 
The variations in EKC/Oyashio and ESC volume 
transports are responsible for the observed 
temperature and DO interannual changes in the 
intermediate waters of the Kuril Basin of the 
Okhotsk Sea.

seasons in the Okhotsk Sea

Introduction 
 
Ice conditions are formed as a result of complex 
mechanisms taking place between the atmosphere 
and ocean.  Research needs to continue in order to 
reveal the interdependencies between the atmosphere 
and ice, and to explore their causal relationships in 
order to make predictions. The evolution of ice cover 
in the Okhotsk Sea for the period of observations 
determined in this paper is divided into relatively 
low-ice and extreme ice periods.  There is a certain 
cyclic recurrence in the distribution of interannual 
variability estimations of ice conditions.  However, 
these regularities have a generalized character. 
 
The prevalence of cold winter conditions in the 
Okhotsk Sea was noted until the mid-1980s.  Later, a 
radical change occurred in the course of average 
annual ice conditions values.  The prevalence of low-
ice winter seasons was noted since 1984 
(Muktepavel, 2001).  In certain situations, low ice-
cover distributions at separated years, or even at 
separated periods, has an untypical character and can 
interrupt the long-term averages.  So, extremely low-
ice winters in the Okhotsk Sea were noted in 1991, 
1996, 1997 and 2006. 
 
The baric fields above the central part of the 
Northern Hemisphere at 30°–70°N, 120°–160°E 
were analyzed to reveal the mechanism for the ice 
formation phenomena.  It is shown in this paper that 
such ice condition extremes are formed as a result of 
anomalous 500 hPa geopotential growth above the 
Okhotsk Sea. The anomalous atmospheric circulation 
promotes the carrying of warm air masses to offshore 
water.  These masses are localized above the central 
part of the Okhotsk Sea, where the temperature 
anomalies are about +8°. 
 
In this paper we identify a mechanism for the 
formation the regularities of extremely low-ice 
winters in the Okhotsk Sea with a provision for 
large-scale processes above the second natural 
synoptical region in the North Hemisphere. 
 
Data and Methods 
 
The complete database of averaged 10-day ice cover 
in the Okhotsk Sea was obtained from satellite 
imagery.  The anomalies of ice cover in February for 
extreme ice years in the Okhotsk Sea were chosen:  
 
Lм – L ср > 1/2 A  for extremely high ice years, 
Lм – L ср < 1/2 A  for extremely low ice years 
 
where L м is the monthly mean ice cover in February, 
Lср is the mean annual ice cover in February, and A 
is the amplitude in the change of parameter. 
 
Data of aerologic stations from 1950–2006 were 
used from the Far Eastern Regional Hydro-
meteorological Research Institute’s archives. The 
archives of average monthly data on H500 
geopotential were obtained from the CD-ROM 
“NCER/NCAR reanalysis of monthly mean CD-
ROM 1948–1998” and the average monthly data on 
above-earth pressure was taken from http://dss.ucar. 
edu/datasets/ds.010.1/data for 1948–2003. 
 
Results and Discussion  
 
Figure 1 shows the long-term distribution of average 
annual deviations of ice cover in the Okhotsk Sea on 
a background of ice cover anomaly distributions. 
 
It demonstrates the presence and length of short and 
long cycles of the anomalous increase and decrease 
in ice cover from 1957 to 2007. Starting from 1984, 
there is an accumulation of negative anomalies that 
represent low-ice years. Years of extremely low-ice 
conditions in Okhotsk Sea, in which ice cover was 
more than 20% less than the annual mean average, 
were determined for 1984, 1991, 1996, 1997, and 
2006.

low-ice years of 1984, 1991, 1996, 1997, 2006 were 
determined when ice cover was more than 20% less 
than the annual mean average. 
 
Figure 3 shows the mean annual ice positions of the 
ice edges during extremely low-ice years.  During 
these years, there is a characteristic absence of ice in 
the central part of the Okhotsk Sea and to northeast 
of the Sakhalin shelf.  For comparison, the positions 
of the ice edge for the extremely high ice year (2001) 
is also shown. 
 
The significant changes in the baric fields at AT 500 
over the Asia-Pacific region existed during the 1990s 
(Shatilina, 1998).  First, to explain the mechanism of 
extremely low ice formation, we analyzed the local 
atmospheric processes over the Okhotsk Sea using 
observed data of aerological stations, located on 
perimeter of the Okhotsk Sea.

In Figure 4 we see the general regular pattern of 
atmospheric processes for extremely low-ice years. 
There is a high pressure system over Okhotsk Sea that 
causes a growing geopotential here. In 1984, the area of 
the low heights at a level of AT500 was displaced into 
the region of the south Kuril Islands while high-altitude 
Pacific atmospheric ridge intruded into the Okhotsk Sea 
(Fig. 4a). Anomalies of geopotential reached 6–9 dam 
over the sea (Fig. 4 b).  In January 1996 the Okhotsk 
Sea was also under the influence of a high-altitude 
Pacific tropospheric ridge. The tropospheric whirl was 
displaced on continental regions adjacent to the 
northwestern part of the Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 4 d). 
 
In 2006 there was the same regularity over the 
Okhotsk Sea as in 1984, 1996, 1997. We found a 
general regularity in the structure of the atmospheric 
baric field over the Okhotsk Sea in extremely low-ice 
years. Figure 5 shows the anomalous increasing 
geopotential heights over the sea. 
Figure 6 shows the difference of the high-altitude 
baric field in extreme high-ice years in comparison 
with extreme low-ice years in the Okhotsk Sea. For 
example, in February of 1979 and 2001 historical 
maximum ice cover was situated in the area of the 
Okhotsk Sea having a very low pressure at a level of 
AT500 (502–504 hP а) (Fig. 6a and c). Its anomalies 
in the eastern part of the sea ranged from –10 to –16 
dam (Fig. 6b and d). 
 
The regularities in the change of atmospheric 
circulation forming extreme ice cover are a response to 
the large-scale processes existing in the North Pacific 
and near Arctic. Figure 7 presents such a large-scale 
process with the average annual of baric field at 
AT500. The position of the main climatic hollow 
(isobar 516 hPa) on the eastern side of the Okhotsk Sea 
can be seen. South of it is the High Altitude Frontal 
Zone of the Northern Hemisphere. The cold climatic 
hollow is located over the Okhotsk Sea.

Figure 8 shows the large-scale field AT500 in 
January 1991 and 1997 when extreme H500 values 
were registered over the Okhotsk Sea. These 
anomalies  were  shown  by the position of a 
tropospheric hollow, which was practically absent in 
extreme warm winters (Shatilina, 1998). The 
Okhotsk tropospheric cyclone occupied the southern 
position over the north Kuril Islands. The hollow is 
not noted in extreme warm winters. 
 
The increase of high-altitude pressure in January and 
February means a weakening of the high-altitude 
climatic hollow and Okhotsk minimum (the secondary 
arctic curl).  This means a decrease in the intensity of 
incoming arctic cool air on the surface of the Okhotsk 
Sea.

PICES Scientific Report No. 36  33 
In January 1996 (Fig. 9a and b) the northeastern part 
of the Okhotsk Sea was under the influence of a 
Pacific high-altitude ridge which means that there 
was an intensive intrusion of warm air over the 
Okhotsk Sea water  (a high-altitude ridge is formed 
over the warm water of the Pacific Ocean). 
 
The anomalous circulation in the troposphere 
prompted a change in the trajectory of surface 
cyclones forming a cyclogenesis over the Okhotsk 
Sea. The trailing part of the cyclones displaced over 
the Okhotsk Sea caused the transportation of warm 
air and increased warm ocean water advection 
through the Kuril Straits (Fig. 9) (Pavlichev and 
Muktepavel, 2000).  
For comparison of the position of the climatic hollow 
and of the Okhotsk tropospheric cyclone, Figure 10 
shows large-scale processes in January 1978 which 
was an extreme high-ice year. The position of large 
anomaly centers (marked with “Cold” and “C”) in 
the H500 field can be seen, one of which lies over 
the northwestern part of the Okhotsk Sea. The results 
show that large-scale processes for extremely low-ice 
conditions in the Okhotsk Sea were due to a 
localization of warm air over the central part of the 
sea. Positive anomalies of the air temperature along 
55°N were about 8°C (Fig. 11). Increased advection 
of warm ocean water inside the Okhotsk Sea through 
Bussol Strait is seen in Figure 12 for the noted years

Conclusions 
 
Figure 13 presents a general scheme of large-scale 
processes responsible for the formation of extreme 
low-ice in the Okhotsk Sea. 
 
We conclude that: 
• An Okhotsk Sea tropospheric cyclone (in January, 
February) weakens and is displaced on 
continental regions under extremely low-ice 
conditions; 
• A cold centre in the troposphere over the Okhotsk 
Sea had large positive anomalies of 500 hPa 
geopotential (centres of the heat);  
• Such a situation formed as a result of frequent 
intrusions of a Pacific tropospheric ridge over 
most areas of the Okhotsk Sea;  
• The anomalous circulation in the troposphere of 
the research region prompted a change in the 
trajectory of surface cyclones forming a 
cyclogenesis over the Okhotsk Sea;  
• The trailing part of the cyclones, displaced over 
the Okhotsk Sea, caused the transportation of 
warm air and increased the advection of relatively 
warm ocean water through the Kuril Straits;  
• Localization of the warm air is observed above a 
central part of the Okhotsk Sea.

Introduction 
 
The Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 1) is believed to be the main 
source of North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW; 
e.g., Talley, 1991; Yasuda et al., 1997).  The source 
water of the NPIW in the Okhotsk Sea is called the 
Okhotsk Sea Mode Water (OSMW) and is 
characterized by a minimum of potential vorticity 
whose density range is 26.6–27 σ
θ
 (Yasuda, 1997). 
The OSMW is formed by the mixing of the Dense 
Shelf Water (DSW), the Western Subarctic Water 
from the North Pacific through the Kuril Straits 
(Kitani, 1973), and the Forerunner of the Soya Warm 
Current Water from the Japan Sea through the Soya 
Strait (Takizawa, 1982; Watanabe and Wakatsuchi, 
1998).

The DSW is relatively cold and fresh water in the 
Okhotsk Sea. Its density range is within 26.6 −27.05 
σ
θ
, although definitions of the range are slightly 
different among studies. Itoh et al. (2003) estimated 
the mixing ratio of the three types of water masses to 
form the OSMW from an isopycnal climatological 
dataset based on historical observations and 
suggested that nearly half of the OSMW consists of 
the DSW. 
 
Kitani (1973) suggested that the DSW, with density 
up to 27.02 σ
θ
, is formed by brine rejection through a 
high sea ice formation in the northwestern shelf 
region located northwest of Sakhalin (see Fig. 1). A 
high production of ice takes place in the coastal 
polynya along the northwestern coast of the Okhotsk 
Sea because of strong offshore winds and cold air 
temperature in winter, then it is considered that the 
brine rejection to form the DSW mainly occurs in 
that region (Alfultis and Martin, 1987; Martin et al., 
1998; Ohshima et al., 2003; Shcherbina et al., 2003). 
The formed DSW is transported to the south along 
the eastern coast of Sakhalin by the East Sakhalin 
Current (Ohshima et al., 2002; Mizuta et al., 2003) 
and contributes to the OSMW formation. 
 
Impacts of factors leading to the DSW formation 
have been demonstrated by some numerical studies. 
Nakamura et al. (2006) investigated the effect of 
tidal mixing in the Kuril Straits for the DSW 
formation with a sea–ice coupled model. They 
simulated ocean circulations with and without the 
tidal mixing effect which is represented by setting a 
strong vertical diffusivity around the Kuril Islands 
and suggested that more DSW is formed by the tidal 
mixing effect through the following process. An 
upward salinity flux to the upper layer occurs due to 
the tidal mixing effect around the Kuril Islands and 
increases salinity in the upper layer. This positive 
anomaly of salinity by tidal mixing is transported 
from the Kuril Islands to the north through the 
eastern part of the Okhotsk Sea by a basin-scale 
cyclonic circulation which is mainly driven by wind 
stress (Ohshima et al., 2004). As more saline 
(denser) brine is rejected in the northwestern shelf 
region because of the transported positive salinity 
anomaly, more DSW is formed. 
 
Matsuda (2008) examined the impact of wind 
strength on the DSW formation with the tidal mixing 
effect, and showed that stronger winds also increase 
the DSW production. He explained that the wind-
driven cyclonic circulation intensified by the 
amplified wind transports the more positive salinity 
anomaly originating with the tidal mixing effect to 
the northwestern shelf region. This transported 
salinity anomaly results in more saline (denser) brine 
and more DSW formation than those with the tidal 
mixing effect only. As mentioned later, it seems that 
the amplified wind has more effect on DSW 
formation. 
 
However, the horizontal resolutions of the models 
are 1° in Nakamura et al. (2006) and a half degree in 
Matsuda (2008). These horizontal resolutions are too 
coarse to resolve well the northwestern coastal 
polynya which is several tens of kilometers in width 
(Martin et al., 1998). Then, it is suggested that the 
DSW formation in the northwestern coastal polynya 
has not been well reproduced in former studies. In 
this study, the impacts of factors leading to the DSW 
formation are examined using a sea −ice coupled 
model with a horizontal resolution which is several 
kilometers in the northern part of the Okhotsk Sea. It 
is then expected that the model will resolve the 
coastal polynya along the northwestern coast. 
 
Model Configuration 
 
Numerical model 
 
The Center for Climate System Research (CCSR) 
Ocean Component Model version 4.2 (COCO4.2; 
e.g., Hasumi, 2006) is employed as the ice–ocean 
coupled model in this study. COCO4.2 solves 
primitive equations for three-dimensional ocean 
circulation and sea ice formation in the generalized 
curvilinear horizontal coordinate. By virtue of this 
coordinate system, one can arrange a computational 
grid pattern with locally high horizontal resolution 
and efficiently simulate phenomena on a small scale 
and their interaction with a circulation field in the 
relatively extensive surrounding area under a 
limitation of computational resources. 
 
Figure 2a shows the model domain and the 
computational grid pattern in this study. The model 
domain covers the North Pacific. The horizontal 
resolution is up to 790 km in the South Pacific while 
it is less than 8 km in the northern part of the 
Okhotsk Sea to well resolve the northwestern coastal 
polynya and brine rejection (Fig. 2b). 
 
The model topography is basically made from Earth 
Topography-5 Minute (ETOPO5; National 
Geophysical Data Center, 1988). The topography

data made by Ono et al. (2006) is also used around 
the Kashevarov Bank because of inaccuracy of the 
ETOPO5 data in that region. 
 
Boundary conditions 
 
Simulated temperature and salinity are restored to the 
Polar Science Center Hydrographic Climatology (PHC; 
Steel et al., 2001) from 15°S to the south. Sea surface 
salinity (SSS) is also restored to the PHC while it is not 
restored in the Okhotsk Sea in order to examine the 
salinity transport at the upper layer, as mentioned in 
Nakamura et al. (2006) and Matsuda (2008). 
The experiments in this study are shown in Table 1. 
In all the experiments, the sea surface momentum 
and heat fluxes are calculated basically from the 
monthly climatological dataset of the Ocean Model 
Intercomparison Project (OMIP; Röske, 2001), 
which is based on European Centre for Medium-
Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 15-year 
reanalysis. The bulk formulae of Kara et al. (2000) 
are used for the flux calculation from the OMIP data. 
The OMIP dataset is directly applied in Run 1 and 
Run 2. 
 
The vertical mixing effect by the tide in the Kuril 
Straits is implemented in Run 2, Run 3 and Run 4. 
The background vertical diffusivity coefficient is set 
to 200 cm
2

 over the sill around the Kuril Islands 
in these experiments to represent the vertical mixing 
effect while it is less than 3 cm

 (Tsujino et al., 
2000) in the other region. Nakamura et al. (2006) 
adopted the value of 200 cm

 in their model, 
based on the results of former studies (Nakamura et 
al., 2000; Nakamura and Awaji, 2004). Results of 
Matsuda (2008) also supported the validity of this 
value in terms of the DSW formation and its 
transport. 
 
Ohshima et al. (2003) pointed out that the wind 
speed data reanalyzed by ECMWF are smaller than 
those of observed in-situ data, by about 25% in the 
Okhotsk Sea. Some numerical studies for the 
Okhotsk Sea have adopted the ECMWF wind stress 
amplified by factors of about 1.5 (e.g., Simizu and 
Ohshima, 2002; Simizu and Ohshima, 2006). The 
wind stress of ECMWF is also used in Matsuda 
(2008), and he reported that a realistic circulation on 
the isopycnal surface of 26.8 σ
θ
 is reproduced with 
the amplified wind stress by a factor of 1.5. The wind 
stress of the OMIP data is also amplified by a factor 
of 1.5 in the Okhotsk Sea in Run 3 and Run 4.

Figure 3 shows a comparison of river runoff in the 
Okhotsk Sea between the OMIP dataset and that 
from in-situ observation (Perry et al., 1996). The 
river runoff of the OMIP is calculated by a land 
model using the ECMWF evaporation and 
precipitation data. The annual mean river runoff of 
the Amur River is about 10,000 m

 in the two 
datasets. On the other hand, the total amount of 
annual mean river runoffs in the Okhotsk Sea,

(Figs. 4a, b and c), in which the OMIP river runoff 
data are directly used, show strong low-salinity 
fronts along the northwestern coast where the DSW 
is mainly formed. River runoffs in the Okhotsk Sea, 
except the Amur River, are removed in Run 4 in 
order to examine the impact of the uncertainty of 
river runoff among datasets to the DSW formation.

the Kamchatka Peninsula while those in italics indicate the 
annual mean runoff of the Amur River. 
 
In each experiment, the model is integrated for 16 
model years from a static state with the temperature 
and salinity fields in January of the PHC. The sea ice 
formation, sea surface salinity and the DSW 
formation reach a steady state in the Okhotsk Sea. 
Results of the experiments in the 16th model year are 
compared in this study. 
 
Results 
 
Table 2 shows the production rate of the DSW in 
each experiment. Definition of the DSW production 
rate is based on Itoh et al. (2003).  They defined the 
DSW as water on the northwestern shelf, with 
density within 26.75–27.05 σ
θ
, temperature less than 
0°C and its production rate as the total volume of 
DSW existing from spring to summer divided by a 
year. In this study, the DSW production rate is 
defined as the volume of the DSW existing from  
April to September in an area north of 54°N and west 
of 153°E, with the bottom depth shallower than 
200 m divided by a year. 
 
The DSW production rate by Run 1 is smaller than 
the range of estimates based on observations (Martin 
et al., 1998; Gladyshev et al., 2000; Itoh et al., 
2003). The DSW production increases on adding the 
effects of the tide around the Kuril Islands, the 
intensification of the wind stress and removing the 
runoffs in Run 2, Run 3 and Run 4, respectively, and 
is within the range of the observational estimates. 
DSW production rates in Run 2, Run 3 and Run 4 are 
clearly larger than those in the experiment with the 
vertical diffusion coefficient of 200 cm
2 
s
–1
 around 
the Kuril Islands in Nakamura et al. (2006). Even the 
production rate in Run 1, in which the tidal effect is 
not implemented, is slightly larger than that in the 
experiment in Nakamura et al. (2006). The annual 
sea ice production in the Okhotsk Sea in each 
experiment (Table 3) is much larger than that in the 
experiment in Nakamura et al. (2006) and close to 
that estimated from observed data (e.g., Ohshima et 
al., 2003). Figure 5 shows the horizontal 
distributions of annual sea ice production in the 
northwestern shelf region. The coastal polynya is 
clearly reproduced along the northwestern coast in 
each experiment because of the much higher 
resolution than that in Nakamura et al. (2006), as 
mentioned in the previous sections. The model in 
each experiment, then, also reproduced the high sea 
ice production in the coastal polynya mentioned in 
the observational studies (Alfultis and Martin, 1987; 
Climate/Ocean dynamics

Martin et al., 1998; Ohshima et al., 2003). It can be 
considered that the more realistic the sea ice 
production results, the more brine rejection and DSW 
formation there is. 
 
Abyssal density (Table 4) also increases by each effect. 
Horizontal distributions of abyssal density in September 
(Fig. 6) show that shaded regions where bottom water 
meets the criteria of the DSW in Itoh et al. (2003), 
increases by each effect.  It corresponds to the increase 
of the DSW production rate. The observed distribution 
of abyssal density in September, 1999 around 56°N 
(thick solid line in Fig. 6a; Shcherbina et al., 2003) 
shows a maximum near 140°E with density larger than 
26.9 σ
θ
. Such maxima of the abyssal density larger than 
26.85 σ
θ
 are also shown on the same line in Run 3 and 
Run 4, in which the ECMWF wind stress is amplified 
by a factor of 1.5. 
 
Annual mean SSS in the Okhotsk Sea (Table 5) 
mainly increases by adding the tidal effect (Run 2) 
and removing the river runoff (Run 4). SSS increases 
in all runs over the Okhotsk Sea by adding the tidal 
mixing effect (Fig. 4b).  It seems that this increment 
is attributed to that of the northward salinity flux in 
the upper layer from the Kuril Islands originating 
with the upper salinity flux by the tidal mixing effect. 
The SSS intensification makes the brine in the 
northwestern shelf region more saline (denser) and 
results the more DSW formation, as mentioned in 
Nakamura et al. (2006). In Run 4 (Fig. 4d), the 
low-salinity front along the northwestern coast 
vanishes by removing the river runoffs in the 
Okhotsk Sea, except the Amur River.  The increase 
of the abyssal density and the DSW formation may 
be attributed to the vanishing of the low-salinity front 
along the northwestern shelf region where the high 
production of sea ice and the brine rejection occurs.

SSS increases in the northern part of the Okhotsk Sea 
while it decreases in the southern part by the 
intensification of the wind stress in Run 3. The 
average SSS does not increase significantly in Run 3, 
(Table 5). It is considered that the wind-driven basin- 
scale circulation is intensified by the amplified wind 
in the Okhotsk Sea, and the salinity anomaly is 
transported farther north by the intensified 
circulation from the Kuril Islands, as mentioned in 
Matsuda (2008). 
 
It seems there is one more effect of the amplified 
wind stress to the DSW formation. The annual sea 
ice production (Table 3) increases by intensification 
of the wind stress in Run 3 and Run 4. The 
northwestern coastal polynyas in Run 3 and Run 4 
are wider and clearer than those in Run 1 and Run 2 
because of intensification of the offshore wind along 
the northwestern coast. The horizontal distributions 
of annual sea ice production (Fig. 5) show a 
significant increment in sea ice production along the 
northwestern coast in Run 3 and Run 4. It is 
considered that the DSW formation is also 
intensified by the increase in brine rejection due to 
the intensification of the northwestern coastal 
polynya by the amplified wind.

Summary 
 
In this study, the series of sensitivity experiments on 
the DSW formation in the Okhotsk Sea was 
performed with the sea–ice coupled model which 
well resolves the coastal polynya along the 
northwestern coast of the Okhotsk Sea. 
 
The model reproduced more sea ice production and 
DSW formation than the former numerical studies 
because of the clearly reproduced northwestern 
coastal polynya. We confirmed the intensification of 
the DSW formation by the effects of tidal mixing in 
the Kuril Straits and the intensification of wind stress 
in the Okhotsk Sea, which makes the brine more 
saline in the northern shelf area, the same as in the 
former studies. 
 
It was shown that the brine also becomes more saline 
by removing the unrealistically large amount of 
runoff in the Okhotsk Sea in the OMIP reanalysis 
dataset. On the other hand, Perry et al. (1996), which 
is used for validating the OMIP river runoff data, 
includes only runoffs of major rivers, and the 
accurate total amount of the river runoffs is currently 
not clear. Therefore, it cannot be said whether or not 
Run 4 reproduced more realistic DSW formation 
than Run 3 in the present study. We emphasize that 
there is a considerable amount of uncertainty in the 
river runoff datasets regarding DSW formation. 
 
Sea ice production in the Okhotsk Sea increased 
because of the intensification of the wind stress in 
this study while it did not increase because of wind 
intensification in Matsuda (2008). This may be 
attributed to the reproduction of the clear coastal 
polynya because of the local high horizontal 
resolution of the model in this study. It is considered 
that the intensification of ice production due to wind 
intensification also contributes to the incremental  
amounts of brine and DSW production.

The Amur River is one of the largest rivers in the world and its influence on the Okhotsk Sea environment is 
significant.  At the same time recent industrial development in the Maur River basin and its estuary suggests 
serious changes in the water characteristics, physical and biogeochemical processes, as well as structure of the 
ecosystem.  However, our knowledge on the status of the environment and ecosystem of this region, as well as 
our understanding of the whole system functioning, are far from sufficient.  Since 2003 POI, in collaboration 
with other institutes of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has started a series of  
comprehensive surveys of the Amur River estuary and adjacent areas, including the lower part of the river, 
Sakhalin Bay of the Okhotsk Sea and northern part of the Tatar Strait in the Japan Sea.  Six expeditions have 
been carried out to study summer, spring and winter conditions of the area, including high water and low water 
regimes and spring under the ice observations.  The observations and sampling included CTD and current 
measurements, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, pH, total alkalinity, chlorophyll-a, humic substances, calcium, 
magnesium, suspended matter, microbiological activity in the water as well as structure, isotopic content and 
organic matter in the bottom sediments.  Many of the observations and comprehensive surveys were never 
done here before.  The results on the distribution of physical and chemical parameters, water exchange and 
mixing in the Amur Estuary, transport and transformation of river discharge on th natural barriers, production 
and destruction processes, distribution of the Amur waters into the Okhotsk and Japan seas, as well as the 
status of contamination, are discussed. Continuation of the field surveys is planned for the fall and winter 
periods.

Most oceanographers believe that the indispensable element for phytoplankton growth, iron, is supplied to the 
open ocean as an atmospheric aerosol from arid regions. Here, we present a new hypothesis that the open 
ocean ecosystem is supported not only by atmospheric iron but also by intermediate water iron flowing from 
the coastal zone.  The Amur River is the largest river in Russian Far East flowing into the Okhotsk Sea. 
Because of the broad wetlands in the watershed, dissolved iron concentrations in the Amur River water are 
about 1 mg/l, a million times higher than that in the open ocean surface.  Most of the dissolved iron, in fact, 
precipitates by flocculation around the river mouth.  However, part of the precipitated iron does not deposit on 
the shelf, but is re-suspended by strong tidal currents there and penetrates into the offshore intermediate layer 
(Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water; OSIW) due to water ventilation induced by brine water rejection from sea 
ice formation.  Part of the iron discharged into the OSIW is transported far into the western subarctic Pacific 
by strong ocean currents, without being scavenged owing to the scarce number of organisms in the 
intermediate layer, and finally re-entrained into the surface layer by tidal mixing near the Kuril archipelago, 
and winter convective mixing, supporting the huge phytoplankton bloom in western subarctic Pacific.  Because 
this iron transport system can be easily damaged by global warming or land surface conversion through the 
reduction of sea ice formation or wetland areas, human activities may change the biological productivity in the 
western subarctic Pacific completely in the near future.

Abstract 
 
The development of a quantitative understanding of the interactions among physical, chemical and biological 
processes is critical for predicting the marine ecosystem response to climate change.  This study presents 
results from a coupled plankton/circulation model (ROMS) developed to study factors influencing bloom 
dynamics on the continental shelf of southern Vancouver Island. Model results show the influence of the Juan 
de Fuca Eddy on the growth and retention of phytoplankton and the importance of different sources of 
nutrients (i.e., wind-driven upwelling, topographically controlled upwelling, and the outflow from Juan de 
Fuca Strait) on primary production and biogeochemical cycles.  The usefulness of this type of model to assess 
the potential responses of the marine ecosystem to climate change scenarios is discussed, as well as the 
limitations of present biogeochemical models, to predict future climate change. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Ecosystem models are important tools to study 
biogeochemical cycles that are driven by complex 
interactions among physical, chemical and biological 
processes. In the open ocean, simple ecosystem 
models coupled to zero- or one-dimensional physical 
models have successfully contributed to the study of 
the importance of macro- and micronutrients on 
primary production, food-web interactions and 
physical–biological interactions (e.g., Fasham et al., 
1990; Doney et al., 1996). However, the high 
temporal and spatial variability of coastal regions 
makes it often necessary to couple ecosystem models 
to high resolution circulation models. Plankton 
ecosystem models coupled to circulation models are 
increasingly being applied to a variety of regions in 
the ocean to improve our understanding of ecosystem 
dynamics and to generalize discrete observations 
(e.g., Gruber et al., 2006; Powell et al., 2006). These 
ecosystem models also have the potential to help us 
understand and quantify the interactions between 
marine ecosystems and climate change and to predict 
plausible ecosystem changes. 
 
The southwestern coast of Vancouver Island (Fig.1) 
is one of the most productive fishing regions along 
the west coast of Canada (Ware and McFarlane, 
1989). This region is at the northern end of the 
California Current System and is influenced by 
summer coastal upwelling. It is also influenced by 
freshwater inputs from the Fraser River, producing 
an estuarine circulation and strong tidal currents 
(Crawford, 1991). All these processes contribute to 
the dynamics of nutrient supply and phytoplankton 
and ultimately to the high primary productivity

observed in this region. In the summer, 
phytoplankton blooms are often found in this region 
associated with the Juan de Fuca Eddy, a seasonal 
cyclonic cold eddy located west of the entrance to 
Juan de Fuca Strait. This eddy is formed during 
periods of upwelling favorable winds, which in 
combination with the estuarine flow and tides, 
produce enhanced upwelling off Cape Flattery 
(Foreman et al., 2008). Similarly, the Okhotsk Sea is 
one of the most biologically productive regions in the 
world with high fisheries production and high 
primary productivity, especially on the continental 
shelf (e.g., Sorokin and Sorokin, 2002). In these 
dynamical regions, the coupling of an ecosystem 
model to a three-dimensional coastal ocean 
circulation model should yield new insight on the 
physical processes affecting the distribution of 
micronutrients in the region, and help understand the 
resulting impact on phytoplankton growth. 
 
In this study, a simple plankton ecosystem model has 
been coupled to a circulation model (Regional Ocean 
Modeling System, ROMS) to study factors 
influencing summer bloom dynamics on the 
continental shelf off southwestern Vancouver Island. 
In the next section the model is described. Then, 
model results are presented and discussed, followed 
by a summary. 
 
Model Description 
 
Biological model 
 
The model developed in this study is based upon the 
one-dimensional mixed layer/five-component NPZD 
(nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus) type 
model previously developed for the subarctic Pacific 
(Peña, 2003). The model was mainly modified to 
include the silicon cycle, separate compartments for 
NO
3
 and NH
4
, microzooplankton grazing on small 
and large phytoplankton, and differential re- 
mineralization of sinking silicon and nitrogen 
detritus. The increased complexity was necessary to 
represent conditions more characteristic of coastal 
regions. The modified ecosystem model has eight 
compartments: dissolved nutrients (NO
3
, NH
4
 and 
Si(OH)
4
), diatoms that take up Si(OH)
4
, a small size 
class of phytoplankton, microzooplankton, and two 
types of sinking detritus (nitrogen and silicon 
detritus). The food-web structure is shown 
schematically in Figure 2. All model compartments 
are expressed in terms of their nitrogen concentration 
(mmol-N m
–3
). The processes incorporated in the 
model include growth of small phytoplankton and 
diatoms controlled by light, NO
3
 and NH
4
, and for 
diatoms also by Si(OH)
4
. Uptake of nutrients by 
phytoplankton during the growth process is 
represented via a Michaelis-Menten formulation. 
Grazing by microzooplankton on small and large 
phytoplankton and nitrogen detritus is modeled by 
the Holling type-III formulation. Natural loss 
processes (i.e., mortality and excretion) for both 
phytoplankton and zooplankton are linear. The 
differential remineralization of nitrogen and silicon 
detritus is linear as well. As in the previous model, 
the effect of top-down control by mesozooplankton 
in this model is formulated by imposing the grazing 
pressure of the observed biomass on diatoms and 
microzooplankton using a Holling type-III 
formulation. Also in the model, temperature affects 
all physiological parameters according to Q
10
 factors 
referenced to 10°C. 
 
Biophysical model 
 
The biological model is coupled to a three-
dimensional coastal ocean circulation model. The 
circulation model is an implementation of the ROMS 
developed by Foreman et al. (2008). The model 
domain is bounded by approximately 45.5°N to  
50.0°N and 123.5°W to 128.5°W, with 30 non-
uniform vertical layers, with increased resolution 
near the surface and bottom boundary layers. A

stretched coordinate rectangular grid with horizontal 
resolution as coarse as 5 km adjacent to the western 
boundary and as fine as 1 km near the entrance of 
Juan de Fuca Strait is employed to obtain an accurate 
representation of topographic and coastal features of 
the region. The model is forced with tides, average 
summer upwelling-favorable winds, temperature and 
salinity monthly climatologies, and buoyancy 
boundary conditions that maintain an estuarine flow 
in Juan de Fuca Strait. The initial and boundary 
conditions of the model for nitrate and silicate are 
derived from three-dimensional summer climatology 
generated from a combination of data from the 
Institute of Ocean Sciences and the World Ocean 
Database 2001. For lack of better information, all 
other compartments are initialized with a constant 
value. Given the prescribed forcing, the model 
simulates summer conditions of temperature, salinity 
and currents that are in reasonable agreement with 
observations (Foreman et al., 2008). 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
The model was run for 60 days and the results from 
the last 15 days are presented here. The modeled 
surface distribution of phytoplankton (diatoms and 
small phytoplankton) and nitrate concentration  
(Fig. 3) show the influence of the Juan de Fuca Eddy, 
located west of Juan de Fuca Strait, on the growth 
and retention of phytoplankton. Phytoplankton 
concentrations are higher around the eddy region and 
along the Washington upwelling coast. Similarly, 
nitrate is abundant (>15 mmol m
–3
) nearshore and in 
the estuarine outflow from Juan de Fuca Strait that  
curls around the eddy in a counterclockwise manner. 
Nutrient concentrations decrease seaward such that 
no detectable nitrate was observed in the upper 10 m 
west of the continental shelf. 
 
The modeled phytoplankton distribution patterns are 
in agreement with remotely-sensed observations of 
ocean color during the summer, as illustrated in 
Figure 4. In particular, the model captures the 
increased phytoplankton abundance in the 
continental shelf and eddy region, and lower 
concentrations offshore, but tends to over-predict 
phytoplankton biomass in Juan de Fuca Strait.  
 
To determine the importance of different sources of 
nutrients (i.e., wind-driven upwelling, topographically 
controlled upwelling, and the outflow from Juan de 
Fuca Strait) on phytoplankton biomass and primary 
production, the model was run with and without tidal 
forcing and wind forcing. Results from these 
experiments indicate that estuarine outflow from Juan 
de Fuca Strait is essential for nutrient enrichment and 
bloom generation. The strong influence of tidal 
mixing on nitrate fluxes from the estuarine outflow is 
illustrated in Figure 5, which shows that fluxes are 
significantly reduced in the simulation without tidal 
forcing compared to those from the simulation without 
winds but with tides. In the model, the eddy is formed

when either wind or tidal forcing is applied. A 
stronger bloom in the eddy region is obtained when 
the model is forced with estuarine flow and tides 
instead of with estuarine flow and winds.  
 
In summary, our results indicate that phytoplankton 
production is influenced by nutrient fluxes, 
stratification, and temperature, all of which are likely 
to be affected by climate change. Impacts on 
phytoplankton will lead to cascading effects 
throughout the marine ecosystem. In coastal regions, 
the high temporal and spatial variability makes it 
challenging to detect ecosystem changes based on 
  
observations only. Thus, there is a need to develop 
three-dimensional circulation models that can point 
to plausible changes. To work towards this aim, the 
model was used to explore ecosystem responses to 
changes that might accompany climate change. 
Figure 6 shows preliminary results from a warming 
simulation where a constant offset of 3°C is applied 
to the initial temperature field. For the warming 
simulation, model phytoplankton biomass is of 
similar magnitude and distribution pattern to that of 
the standard run. In contrast, the model exhibits a 
more pronounced effect on primary production, 
resulting in higher productivity in the warming 
simulation. Since phytoplankton biomass is the result 
of growth and grazing, the results suggest that 
zooplankton grazing also increases with warming. It 
should be noted that in this simple warming 
simulation, the temperature offset applied to the 
model has no effect on the mixed-layer evolution and 
only explores the response of the ecosystem model to 
warming, separated from the response that might 
result from changes in the physical model. 
 
Additional interpretation of these results is not 
warranted, since although the model can reproduce 
observations reasonably well, it has little ‘predictive’ 
power. The model currently lacks the complexity 
(species or functional groups, parameters that 
‘adapt/change’ in response to changing ocean 
conditions/forcing, etc.) for the ecosystem to behave 
differently under different oceanic or climatic 
regimes.  However, adding complexity (and realism) 
to models does not necessarily improve their 
predictive power, especially if the information

Summary 
 
Overall, this study provides an example of the utility 
of a coupled ecosystem/circulation model to the 
study of coastal ecosystems. In particular, the model 
was able to provide useful information on the 
importance of different sources of nutrients to 
phytoplankton growth and distribution, and to the 
transport of phytoplankton to the coast. The 
relatively simple ecosystem model developed here 
can be coupled to circulation models of other coastal 
regions, such as the Sea of Okhotsk, and can be used 
to address many ecosystem problems.  In summary: 
• The model is able to simulate the major biological 
features of the Vancouver Island shelf, higher 
surface nutrient and phytoplankton biomass in the 
Juan de Fuca Eddy, lower concentrations in Juan 
de Fuca Strait, and coastal upwelling off 
Washington State. 
• The model indicates that the phytoplankton bloom 
in the Juan de Fuca Eddy region is the result of 
estuarine outflow from Juan de Fuca Strait and 
enhanced upwelling off Cape Flattery. The 
upwelling is generated by both the winds and the 
tides. A stronger bloom is generated in the eddy 
when the model is forced with estuarine flow and 
tides compared to the run forced by estuarine flow 
and winds. 
• Preliminary results of the warming simulation 
suggest a strong response in the physiological 
rates of phytoplankton, with higher primary 
production and greater recycling rates but little 
change in concentrations.

Abstract 
 
Samples of sea ice and snow cover on sea ice were collected with the icebreaker P/V Soya in early February 
2007 in the southern Sea of Okhotsk in order to evaluate the amount of nutrients in the sea ice and snow.  The 
concentration of nitrate + nitrite, phosphate and silicic acid in the samples was measured in conjunction with 
such physical parameters as temperature, salinity, oxygen isotopic ratio and ice texture.  Sea ice was 
categorized into three types: snow-ice, granular ice and columnar ice, based on the oxygen isotopic ratio and 
ice texture.  A higher nitrate + nitrite concentration up to 13.5 μmol L
–1
 was found in the snow and snow-ice, 
implying the deposition from the atmosphere, occurring as snowfall.  Phosphate and silicic acid concentrations 
up to 14.3 μmol L
–1
 and 32.7 μmol L
–1
, respectively, were highest in granular ice.  These results indicate the 
incorporation of organisms and/or sediment from under-ice water and subsequent remineralization reactions in 
sea ice. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
In the Sea of Okhotsk, spring brooms were observed 
from satellite images after the ice melting season 
(e.g., http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/imgdata/topics/2004/tp 
040108.html).  Despite the indications that sea ice 
melting has been considerd to play a role in the 
chemical budget and cycling in the Sea of Okhotsk, 
there is a distinct paucity of information on this 
aspect of sea ice.  
 
During the ice formation process, sea ice contains a 
lot of particulate and dissolved materials (Masqué et 
al., 2007). These materials are incorporated through 
atmospheric deposition (Granskog et al., 2003; 
Granskog et al., 2004) and suspension freezing in 
under-ice water (Masqué et al., 2007). Therefore, sea 
ice acts as an effective transporter for particulate and 
dissolved materials. During the ice melting season, 
these materials are released and supplied to the 
under-ice water.  
 
In this study, in order to examine the nutrient profiles 
in snow and sea ice, and mechanisms controlling the 
distribution of nutrients in snow and sea ice, samples 
of snow and sea ice were collected with the 
icebreaker P/V Soya during early February 2007 in 
the southern Sea of Okhotsk.  
Materials and Methods 
 
Sampling of snow, sea ice, and under-ice water   
 
Field observations were carried out during the 
icebreaker P/V Soya’s cruise in the southern Sea of 
Okhotsk on February 12 and 13, 2007 (Fig. 1). Two 
different ice stations (A and B) were selected.  
Samples of sea ice cores, brine in sea ice and under-
ice water were collected at each station. By using a 
basket suspended from the ship’s crane, we could get 
access above the sea ice (Toyota et al., 2007). Sea 
ice cores were collected with an ice core sampler of  
9 cm diameter through a hole on the basket floor. 
Immediately after the ice core was collected, ice 
thickness and temperature of the ice core were  
measured by scale and by inserting a needle-like 
thermometer sensor into a drilled hole of the core, 
respectively. Thereafter, the ice cores were kept in a 
polythene bag in a deep freezer at –15°C during the 
cruise period, and transferred to the cold room at  
–16°C at the Institute of Low Temperature Science 
(ILTS) immediately after the cruise. 
 
The under-ice water sample was collected through an 
ice core hole with a 500 mL Teflon water sampler 
(GL Science Inc., Japan) at depths of 1 m below the 
surface of sea ice. The sample was divided into a

salinity and oxygen isotopic ratio ( δ
18
O) and into a 
10 mL polyethylene screw vial for measuring 
nutrients. Samples for nutrients were kept in the 
same manner as that for the sea ice core samples. 
 
The snow sample deposited over sea ice was 
collected through the side of the basket directly into 
pre-cleaned polyethylene zip-lock bags. The depth 
and temperature of the snow were measured by scale 
and by inserting a needle-like thermometer sensor, 
respectively. 
 
Sample analysis   
 
In the cold room of the ILTS, the sea ice core was 
divided into two pieces longitudinally. One side of 
the ice core was used for the measurement of 
salinity, δ
18
O and nutrients. The other was used for 
the analysis of physical properties.  
  
The sea ice sample was cut to 4.5 cm × 2.5 cm in 
plane size by a band saw and then sliced into 3-cm 
thick sections to measure ice salinity, δ
18
O and 
nutrients. In addition, the sea ice section was divided 
into two pieces longitudinally. One side of the 
section was kept in a Teflon container and then 
melted to measure salinity and δ
18
O. In order to 
avoid contamination, the other piece was trimmed 
with a knife previously washed by acid, and then put 
into pre-cleaned polyethylene bags and melted to 
measure nutrients.   
  
Pictures of the sea ice section divided into two pieces 
were taken. Then, we analyzed the physical 
properties of sea ice using thin and thick sections in 
order to clarify the ice formation history. Details of 
this analysis were described by Granskog et al. 
(2004). In this study, sea ice was categorized into 
three types: snow-ice, granular ice and columnar ice, 
based on the oxygen isotopic ratio and ice texture. 
  
Salinity of the under-ice water, melted snow and sea 
ice were measured using a salt analyzer (SAT-210, 
Toa Electronics Ltd., Japan). A standard deviation 
calculated from the 15 sub-samples taken from a 
single sample bottle gave a salinity of 0.03. Nutrients 
(Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen: DIN-N, Si(OH)

-Si 
and PO

-P) were determined by an auto-analyzing 
system (AACS II, Bran+Luebbe, Germany) 
according to the JGOFS spectrophotometric method 
(JGOFS, 1994).  DIN-N refers to the sum of the 
concentration of NO

defined as the deviation of H

(Toyota et al., 2007).  
 
Results and Discussion 
 
Characteristics of snow, sea ice and under-ice water    
 
Two ice cores with an ice thickness of 47 cm  
(Core 1) and 55 cm (Core 2) were collected at Stn. A 
on February 12, 2007. One ice core with an ice 
thickness of 84 cm (Core 3) was collected at Stn. B 
on  February 13, 2007. Snow depth was 4 cm at Stn. 
A and 9 cm at Stn. B.  
 
Vertical profiles of temperature, salinity and δ
18
O in 
snow and sea ice are shown in Figure 2. 
Temperatures at the upper part of the sea ice were 
lower than that at the bottom of the sea ice. At the 
bottom of the sea ice, temperatures corresponded to 
the freezing point of –1.8°C. Snow temperature was 
Amur River/Geochemical cycle 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  57 
dependent on the atmospheric temperature of –3.1°C 
on February 12, 2007 and –5.5°C on February 13, 
2007. Although the ice temperature increased 
linearly with increasing ice depth, the shape of the 
profile for ice salinity and δ
18
O were irregular 
through the ice cores. These results suggest that the 
dynamic processes were dominated by ice growth in 
the southern Sea of Okhotsk (Toyota et al., 2007).   
 
Figure 3 shows the vertical profiles of the ice section, 
thick and thin section for Core 2. As seen in Figure 
3(a), dirt layers were found at a depth of –30 cm, 
from –35 to –40 cm and from –40 to –50 cm. 
Because δ
18
O was greater than 0‰ through the ice 
core for Core 2 (Fig. 2), sea ice was made from the 
seawater. Therefore, dirt layers were attributed to the 
incorporation of dissolved or particulate materials 
from under-ice water. Dirt layers were also observed 
at a depth of –10 cm in Core 1. 
 
Based on the results obtained from the ice texture 
and δ
18
O (Figs. 2(c) and 3), sea ice was categorized 
into three types: snow-ice, granular ice and columnar 
ice (Table 1). The average data shown in Table 1 
indicate that granular ice was dominant in the total 
ice thickness. These relationships agreed well with 
the results obtained previously in same area (Toyota 
et al., 2004). 
 
Nutrient concentrations in snow, sea ice and 
under-ice water  
 
Vertical profiles of nutrient concentrations in snow, 
sea ice and under-ice water are shown in Figure 4. A 
higher nitrate + nitrite concentration was found in the 
upper part of the sea ice and snow, while phosphate 
and silicic acid concentrations were low. Although 
phosphate and silicic acid concentrations were very 
small in Cores 1 and 3, extremely high 
concentrations were observed in Core 2, where the 
dirt layers were found. This suggests that high 
phosphate and silicic acid concentrations were due to 
the incorporation of the materials from under-ice 
water.  
 
Table 2 shows the nutrient concentrations for snow 
and each ice type. High nitrate + nitrite 
concentrations were found in the snow and snow-ice, 
implying the deposition was from the atmosphere, 
occurring as snowfall. In the Baltic Sea, high 
dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations in 
snow and snow-ice were observed (Granskog et al., 
2003). DIN deposited from the atmosphere with 
snowfall can accumulate on sea ice, and can also 
become incorporated into the ice due to snow-ice 
formation. Because our study area is located off the 
east coast of Asia, it is possible that polluted snow

(high nitrate + nitrite concentration) was deposited 
over the sea ice. Therefore, in the Sea of Okhotsk, 
the atmospheric supply of DIN plays an important 
role in biological productivity within the sea ice and 
under-ice water, as in the Baltic Sea. 
 
Phosphate and silicic acid concentrations were 
highest in granular ice, up to 14.3 μmol L
–1
 and 32.7 
μmol L
–1
, respectively. This probably results from 
the selective incorporation of phosphate and silicic 
acid from seawater to sea ice. During granular ice 
formation, suspended and planktonic organisms were 
scavenged by frazil ice crystals (Lisitzin, 2002). In 
shallow areas, sediments are incorporated into sea ice 
when sea ice rests on the seafloor. In addition, the 
aerobic remineralization and denitrification occurred 
in sea ice (Thomas et al., 1995; Rysgaard and Glud, 
2004). Therefore, nitrate + nitrite concentrations 
were low in granular ice. On the other hand, 
phosphate and silicic acid concentrations were high 
in granular ice. 
 
Conclusions  
 
In order to examine the nutrient profiles in snow and 
sea ice, and mechanisms controlling the distribution 
of nutrients in snow and sea ice, samples of snow 
and sea ice were collected with the icebreaker P/V

Introduction 
 
The offshore waters along the Okhotsk Sea coast of 
Hokkaido, Japan are the southernmost area of 
seasonal sea ice distribution in the Northern 
Hemisphere.  Seasonal sea ice generally drifts ashore 
along the Okhotsk Sea coast of Hokkaido during 
January, reaching a maximum extent during 
February.  The ice then moves offshore to the 
northeast under the influence of southwesterly winds 
and begins to melt during March, retreating 
progressively northward during April. 
 
In the Arctic and Antarctic waters, vertical material 
flux – particularly that of ice algae and the fecal 
pellets of zooplankton – in regions of sea ice plays an 
important role in the pelagic–benthic coupling of 
material cycling and trophic linkages (Hoshiai et al., 
1987; Hobson et al., 1995; Schnack-Schiel, 2003). 
However, a limited number of data on the downward 
material flux under the seasonal sea ice along the 
Okhotsk Sea coast of Hokkaido have been reported. 
  
The present study was undertaken to document the 
spatial and temporal patterns of lithogenic and 
biogenic fluxes, particularly fluxes of opal and 
organic material, in relation to sea ice behavior 
during the pack-ice season at an offshore site in the 
Okhotsk Sea north of Hokkaido (about 14 km off the 
Mombetsu coast, water depth of 60 m) from January 
to March 2005 and 2006. 
 
Materials and Methods 
 
Sea ice coverage in the study area 
 
The first-year ice off the Okhotsk Sea coast of 
Hokkaido from January to March 2005 behaved in an 
ordinary pattern; it drifted ashore along the coast late 
in January, developed to its widest area late in 
February, and retreated late in March (Hiwatari et al., 
2008). On the contrary, the sea ice in 2006 retreated 
one month earlier than the corresponding period of 
2005 (ice data were provided by satellite images 
‘MODIS’ of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency). 
 
Sediment trap mooring 
 
We measured the material flux under seasonal sea ice 
using a time-series sediment trap at a site offshore of 
Mombetsu in the Okhotsk Sea (Fig.1; 44°28.691´N, 
143°25.217´E, water depth 60 m). The sediment trap, 
comprising seven time-series collecting bottles (500 
ml each), was situated at 40 m depth (20 m above the 
sea floor), and the collecting periods were 7 or 14 
days in duration for each of the seven collecting 
bottles over the period from  January 13 to March 24, 
2005 and 2006 (Table 1).

Chemical analyses 
 
The sediment trap samples were analyzed for the 
following items: total mass as dry weight, particulate 
organic carbon (POC), CaCO
3
, chlorophyll a (Chl-
a), pheopigment, biosilica (BioSi), fecal pellet 
carbon of zooplankton, and cell identification and 
enumeration of phytoplankton. 
 
The vertical material flux is expressed as the total 
mass flux, which consists of the lithogenic and 
biogenic component fluxes (Fischer and Wefer, 
1996; Khim et al., 2007) : total mass flux = 
lithogenic particle flux + biogenic particle flux, the 
latter of which is expressed as a total of opal flux, 
organic matter flux and calcium carbonate (CaCO
3
) 
flux. The opal component was calculated by 
multiplying the BioSi content by 2.4 (Khim et al., 
2007). The organic matter was determined by 
multiplying the POC contents by 1/0.35 (Honda et 
al., 1997). The lithogenic particle flux was obtained 
by subtracting the biogenic flux from the total mass 
flux. The organic matter flux in the study consisted 
of detritus, fecal pellets, and phytoplankton. In 
calculating the POC of the phytoplankton in 2005, 
we used POC = Chl-a × 20 (Taguchi et al., 1997). 
For that of the phytoplankton in 2006, we used POC 
= cell number × 91.28 × 10–12 g C/cell (Strathmann, 
1967). The organic matter fluxes of the 
phytoplankton and fecal pellets were then calculated 
by multiplying those POC contents by 1/0.35 (Honda 
et al., 1997). The detritus flux was obtained by 
subtracting the organic matter fluxes of 
phytoplankton and fecal pellets from the total 
organic matter flux. 
 
Results and Discussion 
  
The total mass fluxes consisting of the lithogenic and 
biogenic component fluxes in 2005 and 2006 are 
shown in Figure 2. The total mass fluxes, particularly 
that of lithogenic particles, were greatest during the 
early sampling periods in both years. The occurrence 
of high fluxes of the lithogenic and biogenic 
(particularly organic material) particle components 
relative to the total mass recorded during the early 
sampling periods is consistent with the finding of 
Noriki and Matsubara (2002).  
 
The particulate materials on early first-year ice were 
released into the water column as the sea ice melted 
in seawater temperatures of > 0°C. Oshima et al. 
(2001) observed ice melt around the margins of the 
sea ice on February 9, 1997, about 140 km northeast 
of Mombetsu. In this area, first-year ice floes had 
been advected from the north via the main stream of 
the southward current. 
  
The organic matter fluxes consisting of detritus, fecal 
pellets and phytoplankton component fluxes in 2005 
and 2006 are shown in Figure 3. The organic matter 
fluxes, particularly that of detritus in both years, were 
high during the early sampling periods. The fact that 
organic matter was found in the early first-year ice 
offshore from the Okhotsk coast in early February 
(Granskog, 1999) indicates that decomposition of the 
Amur River/Geochemical cycle 
62  PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
organic matter to detritus via the processes of 
heterotrophic organisms would have occurred in the 
early first-year ice prior to melting. 
 
During the period from early February to early 
March 2005, when persistent ice cover was recorded, 
the fecal pellets of zooplankton were the dominant 
component of sinking particles. In particular, organic 
matter comprising fecal pellets contributed more than 
70% of the total organic matter flux. We also 
observed a large number of diatom frustules in the 
fecal pellets. The present data demonstrate the 
occurrence of fresh phytoplankton in the form of ice 
algae beneath the sea ice and the active grazing and 
egestion of zooplankton during the season of ice 
cover. On the other hand, fecal pellet flux in 2006 
was very little. This suggests that the disappearance 
of fresh ice algae beneath the sea ice could not 
induce active grazing and egestion of zooplankton 
because of the rapid retreat of the sea ice.

The phytoplankton component flux in 2006 was high 
during the late sampling periods which indicates that 
the phytoplankton bloom occurred (not ice algae 
species) because the sea ice retreated a month earlier 
than in the corresponding period of 2005. 
 
Conclusions 
 
• The sea ice in 2006 retreated one month earlier 
than in the corresponding period of 2005. 
• Total mass fluxes during January to early 
February in both years were greater than those in 
other years. In those periods, lithogenic material 
occupied more than 60% of the total mass fluxes, 
much of which would be derived from the sea ice 
as ice-rafted debris. 
• Fecal pellets of zooplankton in 2005 were the 
dominant components of sinking particles from 
February to early March, the periods corresponding 
to a persistent ice cover.

Abstract 
 
Seasonal and interannual variation of primary production after the retreat of sea ice at the scallop farming area 
along the Hokkaido coast off Okhotsk Sea (1998–2004) was determined using satellite images.  Interannual 
variability of primary production occurred from the variability in occurrences of physical processes associated 
with the advection of the Soya Warm Current (SWC) and intrusion of the East Sakhalin Current (ESC). 
Variability in primary production resulted in variability of Chl-a concentration that was also demonstrated by 
EOF analysis.  Enhancement of Chl-a in the frontal area in late spring was shown by the second EOF mode of 
Chl-a (14.2% of variance) in parallel with the generation of a well developed frontal area resulting from the 
advection of warm waters of the SWC along coast in late spring indicated by the second EOF mode of SST 
(1.8% of variance).  Elevated Chl-a and occurrence of cold waters of the ESC in late autumn were also 
highlighted by the third EOF mode of Chl-a (9.0 % of variance) and SST (1.5% of variance).  Prolonged high 
primary production in the scallop farming area after spring is supported by the development of a frontal area in 
summer and enforcement of the ESC in autumn.

Introduction 
 
The Okhotsk Sea is the southernmost marginal sea 
that is ice-covered during winter; therefore, it is 
considered to be an area having sensitive 
environmental characteristics due to the influence of 
global warming. In order to detect such 
environmental changes, monitoring of oceanographic 
conditions is considered important.  However, few 
monitoring studies have been made in the offshore 
area of the Okhotsk Sea due to difficulties making 
observations in the ice-cover season.  
 
The Hokkaido National Fisheries Research Institute 
of the Fisheries Research Agency has been 
conducting monitoring surveys in the southern 
Okhotsk Sea since 2000.  In this study, we report 
some results about oceanographic conditions on 
primary production from monitoring observations in 
the southern Okhotsk Sea. 
 
Observations 
 
Two observation lines (N-line and S-line) were set 
up in the area off Abashiri, in the southern Okhotsk 
Sea (Fig. 1). The oceanographic surveys along these 
lines were conducted in the non-ice seasons 
(generally April–October) 4–5 times a year. The 
routine surveys were CTD casts, vertical profiles of 
chlorophyll a and nutrients (nitrate, phosphate and 
silicate), and netplankton biomass collected with a 
NORPAC net.  For detailed methods, see Saito et al. 
(1998) and Kasai et al. (2001). At some of the 
stations, daily primary production was measured 
with a simulated in situ incubation method using 
13
C 
as tracer (Yokouchi et al., 2006). 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
During the survey periods, the observation area could 
be classified into two water masses. For example, the 
T-S diagrams obtained in April, May, July and 
October of 2005 are shown in Figure 2. As the 
season progressed, two coastal stations showed 
characteristics of high temperature and high salinity 
corresponding to the characteristics of the Soya 
Warm Current. Therefore, the coastal stations should 
be considered under the influence of the Soya Warm 
Current. On the other hand, stations in the offshore 
area showed characteristics of low salinity in the 
surface layer, and a temperature minimum at around 
a salinity of 33 at about 200 m depth.  
 
In this paper, we classify the study area according to 
two water masses: the Coastal Area and the Offshore 
Area. Because the oceanography of the Coastal Area 
has been well investigated for environmental 
conditions related to scallop culturing (Nishihama, 
1994; Horii et al., 1992; Shinada, 2006), we will 
report mainly on oceanographic conditions of the 
Offshore Area.

shown in Figure 3. In April, the temperature profile 
remains constant vertically, but the water column 
becomes stratified by the salinity gradient. After 
May, the temperature in the surface layer increases 
through solar heating, and stratification of the water 
column progresses with the season. Because T-S 
characteristics in the deeper water hardly changed, a 
pycnocline developed remarkably around 20 m depth 
in summer and autumn. 
 
Figure 4 shows the seasonal changes in vertical 
profiles of chlorophyll a mean concentration in the 
Offshore Area. In spring (April), a phytoplankton 
bloom was observed at the surface. In the summer 
and autumn, the maximum layer of chlorophyll a 
moved to the subsurface layer at around 20 m depth, 
forming a subsurface chlorophyll a maximum 
(SCM). The depth of the observed formation of SCM 
corresponds to the pycnocline (Fig. 3).

Seasonal changes in the vertical profiles of nutrient 
concentrations (nitrate, phosphate and silicate) 
showed a similar trend. After April, the nutrient 
concentration in the surface layer decreased with 
season due to feeding by phytoplankton. The 
consumption of nutrients was observed in the layer 
shallower than 20 m depth, corresponding to the 
SCM. In summer and autumn, nitrate was at low 
level in the surface layer, limiting primary 
productivity. This suggests that the SCM was 
maintained using the nutrients supplied from the 
deeper layer through the pycnocline. 
Netplankton biomass was highest in May in both the 
Offshore and Coastal areas (Fig. 5). A similar trend 
in seasonal variation of netplankton biomass was 
also observed in the Oyashio region; however, 
variability was much larger in the Oyashio region, 
compared to the small seasonal variation in the 
southern Okhotsk Sea. The seasonal change in 
species composition of netplankton samples is 
presently unknown. For future study, the temporal 
succession of species composition of not only 
zooplankton, but also phytoplankton, associated with 
movement between water masses, should be 
examined. 
 
Using obtained data from this study, we can 
generally describe the seasonal change of daily 
primary production in the Offshore Area of the 
southern Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 6).  Variability in 
primary production was seasonally small from spring 
to autumn; monthly mean production was about 500 
mgC m
–2
 day
–1
. However, it is notable that we cannot 
capture data on primary productivity in the early 
spring; phytoplankton blooms have occurred in the 
ice-edge area accompanied by ice-melting (Mustapha 
and Saitoh, 2008). Primary production in summer 
was comparable to that in spring. Primary production 
in spring occurred mainly in the surface layer; on the 
other hand, production in summer was mainly in the 
SCM layer. This suggests that primary production 
during summer in the offshore Okhotsk Sea is just as 
important as that during spring in order to supply 
particulate organic matter to higher trophic levels in 
the offshore area.

In this study, we have generally described the 
seasonal change of water column stability, nutrients, 
chlorophyll a, and primary production in the offshore 
area of the southern Okhotsk Sea. The importance of 
primary production at the SCM layer during summer 
and autumn can be indicated. In order to evaluate 
more precisely the primary productivity in the 
studied area, yearly monitoring of oceanographic 
conditions affecting primary productivity needs to be 
conducted. In the future, we can expect that a 
collaborative monitoring system with other 
laboratories and institutes will be established for 
evaluating and predicting the coastal ecosystem of 
the southern Okhotsk Sea in relation to global 
warming.

Introduction 
 
The Sea of Okhotsk is considered to be one of the 
most biologically productive regions in the world’s 
oceans, especially on the continental shelf (Saitoh et 
al., 1996; Sorokin and Sorokin, 1999), and that 
supports high fisheries production. The Sea of 
Okhotsk, which is located in the northwestern Pacific 
rim, is one of the largest marginal seas in the world 
and is also characterized as a region where seasonal 
sea ice reaches the lowest latitudes (Kimura and 
Wakatsuchi, 2000).  When sea ice is formed on the 
northwestern continental shelf in winter, a large 
amount of cold brine water is rejected.  The brine 
water sinks to the bottom of the shelf and forms dense 
shelf water (DSW).  Since the DSW has a large 
amount of resuspended particles due to strong tidal 
mixing on the shelf (Kowakik and Polyakov, 1998), 
the outflow of DSW results in a large flux of particles 
from the shelf to the open ocean (Nakatsuka et al., 
2002). Furthermore, time-series sediment trap 
experiments in the western region of the Sea of 
Okhotsk revealed that biogenic and lithogenic 
particles are exported to the open ocean interior by an 
intermediate water flow (Nakatsuka et al., 2004). 
These previous studies suggested that DSW 
containing these particles contributes to lateral 
material transport and biological productivity.  The 
Amur River, which is one of the largest rivers of 
eastern Eurasia, is also thought to play an important 
role as the major source of terrestrial organic matter to 
the Sea of Okhotsk, and of nutrients for phytoplankton 
growth (Nakatsuka et al., 2004).  Strong tidal currents 
also affect nutrient distributions in the Sea of Okhotsk 
(Andreev and Pavlova, 2009).  However, little is 
known about primary productivity and its controlling 
factors, especially after the spring blooms.  Therefore, 
we examined primary productivity and photosynthetic 
features of phytoplankton in the Sea of Okhotsk 
during August and September 2006. 
Methods 
 
Seawater samples were collected from 17 stations on 
board the Russian R/V Prof. Khromov (Kh06 cruise) 
from August 13 to September 14, 2006 (Fig. 1). 
Samples for chlorophyll (Chl) a concentration and 
primary productivity using simulated in situ 
incubation over a day were obtained from the surface 
(1 m depth), and relative 60, 30, 10, 5 and 1% light 
depths (where relative light intensity in the sea 
surface was defined as 100%). Similarly, samples for 
the photosynthesis–irradiance (P – E) experiment,

Composition a (%) 
and size-fractionated Chl-a (microplankton: > 10 
µm, nanoplankton: 2–10 µm and picoplankton: < 2 
µm) were obtained from the surface and relative 5% 
light depth. Chl-a concentration was estimated by 
using a Tuner Designs 10-AU fluorometer. 
Photosynthetic rate was estimated with a 
13
C tracer 
technique (Hama et al., 1983). 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
Chlorophyll a concentration 
 
Chl-a concentrations were generally high in coastal 
waters near Sakhalin Island (Fig. 2). In particular, 
high Chl-a concentrations were observed in the 
continental shelf of Sakhalin (Station (Stn) C1) and 
Sakhalin Bay (Stn G9), and were 9.7 and 13 mg m
–3
, 
respectively. Higher Chl-a concentrations were also 
found near Stns C1 and G9 in the previous study of 
Sorokin and Sorokin (1999). Similar temporal–
spatial patterns were found in the composition of 
large-sized (> 10 µm) phytoplankton to the total. On 
the other hand, Chl-a concentrations in open waters 
were relatively low (< 1 mg m
–3
). 
 
Primary productivity 
 
During our cruise, surface primary productivity and 
depth-integrated daily primary production within the 
euphotic layer ranged from 7 to 753 mg C m
–3
 d
–1
  
 
and from 74 to 1,986 mg C m
–2
 d
–1
, respectively. 
Higher surface primary productivity, as well as the 
Chl-a distribution, was observed at Stns C1 and G9 
(Fig. 3). These values were within the ranges 
reported previously in the study area during early 
summer (Sorokin and Sorokin, 1999). The surface 
primary productivity correlated significantly with 
Chl-a concentration (R = 0.84, n = 17, P < 0.001), 
but not sea surface temperature, solar light intensity 
(photosynthetic available radiation; PAR) or nutrient 
concentrations. These results indicate that surface 
primary productivity in this study period largely 
depended on the phytoplankton biomass. 
 
Photosynthetic parameters 
 
We also estimated maximum quantum yield of 
carbon fixation in photosynthesis (Φ
c max
; mol C mol 
photon
–1
) from the initial slope of the P – E curve 
and the mean specific absorption coefficient of 
phytoplankton. Φ
c max
 is an index of light utilization 
efficiency in photosynthesis. Higher values of 
surface Φ
c max
 were found in the continental shelf of 
Sakhalin and Sakhalin Bay (0.061 and 0.086 mol C 
mol photon
–1
, respectively), as well as the Chl-a 
concentration and primary productivity. On the other 
hand, surface Φ
c max
 was relatively low in the pelagic 
region. According to Bannister (1974) and Babin et 
al. (1996), Φ
c max
 for natural algal communities in 
optimum physiological conditions was about 0.06

. Therefore, the data 
obtained at Stns C1 and G9 show that phytoplankton 
groups had higher light utilization efficiency in 
photosynthesis and that lower values in open waters 
might be caused by nutrient limitation. In fact, the 
F
v
/F
m
, which is the photochemical quantum 
efficiency of algal photosystem II (PSII) and is an 
index of nutrient (nitrate or Fe) limitations  (Green et 
al., 1992), was lower in the pelagic region, as 
measured with pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) 
fluorometry, but increased after the addition of 
nutrients (Liu et al., 2009).  Although no significant 
relationships were found between photosynthetic 
parameters, including Φ
c max
 at the surface and both 
sea surface temperature and macronutrient levels, 
surface Φ
c max
 correlated with Chl-a concentration  
(R = 0.94, n = 17, P < 0.001). These results indicate 
that the phytoplankton groups with high abundance 
possessed high Φ
c max 
in the study area.

Abstract  
 
Recently, a large number of spotted seals (Phoca largha) have been observed migrating to the Sea of Japan 
from November to May.  Local fishermen and residents, except Rishiri Island, have said they rarely observed 
these seals 20~30 years ago.  In addition, the distribution area has spread and the number of spotted seals has 
tended to increase year after year.  Spotted seals from the Okhotsk Sea area are contributing to the increase in 
the number of individuals recently because of reduced human impacts.  The movement patterns of these seals 
have changed recently, too.  On one hand, it is said that drift ice is decreasing rapidly due to the influence of 
global warming.  The decrease in drift ice means that those seals will find it hard to seek adequate drift ice for 
birth and care of their pups.  This may prevent some individuals from finishing the care of their pups due to the 
melting of the ice floes, and other individuals may have to birth their pups in the water because they cannot 
find adequate ice floes.  On the other hand, seal pups will become easy prey for their predators. Such a 
situation is based on use of the same ice by many pups because of shrinking ice floes.  If these assumptions are 
correct and there is an increase in initial deaths of spotted seals, then population dynamics will change in the 
future.  Spotted seals depend heavily on ice floes, both physically and biologically, so we must extend the time 
to monitor both this species and ice floes. 
 
 
Spotted Seals 
 
General 
 
Spotted seals are mid-sized seals indigenous to the 
northern Pacific Ocean; their northern limit is the 
Bering Sea and their southern limit is the East China 
Sea. They have their particular breeding habitat in 
winter and feeding habitat in summer, so their 
movement or migration area is quite wide. This 
species has characteristics which allow them to 
inhabit not only salty water, but also fresh water, 
such as rivers and lakes. 
  
Life history 
 
Spotted seals move to the coasts of Hokkaido starting 
in November, and they birth and nurse their pups on 
ice floes in the southernmost part of the Sea of 
Okhotsk starting mid-March. Pups are born with 
white lanugo. The nursing period takes about 
2 weeks, and pups spend most of their time on the ice 
floes. At the end of the lactation period, their white 
lanugo starts to molt. The mating season comes after 
the nursing period, so male individuals can be seen 
near the nursing females and their pups on the ice 
floes. After mating, the seals follow the receding ice 
floes and go back to their summer feeding habitat 
farther north of Hokkaido. 
 
Breeding areas 
 
The breeding habitats of spotted seals are classified 
into 8 areas. Listing from the west, they are: the 
Bohai Sea, Peter the Great Gulf and Tatar Strait in 
the Sea of Japan, Sakhalin and Shelekhov Bay in the 
Okhotsk Sea, Karaginski Bay and the Gulf of Anadyr 
in the Bering Sea, and the eastern Bering Sea. 
Groups in the Kuril Islands, Kamchatka and 
Kommandor Islands have not been classified yet 
because investigations did not go far enough. It is 
supposed that the individuals moving to the coast of 
Primary production/Zooplankton/Marine mammals 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  77 
Hokkaido and breeding on the ice floes in the 
southernmost region of the Okhotsk Sea are a part of 
the Sakhalin group. 
 
Summer habitats 
 
There are many haul-out sites where there are groups 
comprised of hundreds or thousands of individuals 
on the eastern coast of Sakhalin and in the northern 
areas of Hokkaido. If we compare the distribution of 
harbor seals that are a closely related to spotted seals 
in the Kuril Islands, harbor seals have their habitats 
and haul-out sites mostly on the mid and southern 
Kuril Islands, while spotted seals are mostly located 
on the northern and southern Kuril Islands 
(Sakhalinrybvod, 1991; Kobayashi, 2008). According 
to the research we did in the 4 northern islands, that 
is, the 4 southernmost Kuril Islands, spotted seals are 
found in waters north of Nemuro Strait and harbor 
seals are found on the Pacific Ocean side. 
 
Changes in Biology 
 
Present distribution of spotted seals 
 
The distribution of spotted seals in Hokkaido in 
recent years is shown in Figure 1. There are 
generally 3 patterns. The first one shows the 
individuals migrating to the Sea of Japan or the Sea 
of Okhotsk sides, shown by dark grey circles. The 
dark grey circles that have place names signify where 
we can observe their haul-out sites every year; the 
ones without names are where we observed the 
swimming individuals or their occasional haul-out 
sites. The regular haul-out sites are found on Rebun, 
Rishiri, and Bakkai Bay, Teuri, Yagishiri, Soya, 
Shakotan, and Otaru on the Sea of Japan. On the 
Okhotsk Sea, they are found at Lake Saroma, 
Abashiri Lake, Cape Notoro and Lake Notoro. These 
individuals come to migrate around November, and 
they stay there until May of the next year. 
 
The second pattern is composed of individuals on the 
Pacific Ocean side, shown by medium grey circles. 
Every year the seals are distributed on Cape Erimo 
and Daikoku Island, and also on the freezing Tokachi 
River or Akkeshi Lake, from February until May.  
 
The third is pattern is made up of only two feeding 
habitats in the summer on Hokkaido, Notsuke and 
Lake Furen, shown by light grey circles. Seals stay 
there from June until February. The number of 
individuals in both habitats total roughly 100 
(Kobayashi, unpublished data). 
 
Changes in biology of spotted seals  
 
The distribution of spotted seals in Table 1 is for 
these recent years (about the last 20 years), so we can 
observe the change in their ecology compared with 
the past.

About 20 to 30 years ago, they used to migrate only 
to Todo Island of Rebun. Nowadays, they migrate to 
more southern areas, down to Shakotan and Otaru 
which have more haul-out sites. Also, the migration 
period is getting longer, for example, they now stay 
at Rebun throughout the year. Originally, individuals 
used to migrate to Todo Island from November to 
May, so we supposed that they were subadults not 
taking part in breeding because adults are found at 
the southernmost area of the ice floes in the Okhotsk 
Sea during this period. Nowadays, however, we can 
observe pregnant individuals in each haul-out site on 
the Sea of Japan, too. It has even been reported that 
they birth pups on Todo Island. The migrating 
population used to amount only to several hundred 
before, but now it is several thousand in the Sea of 
Japan with the number of the migrating individuals 
increasing year by year. We surmise the following 
reasons for the expansion in distribution to the Sea of 
Japan. The use of seals by humans decreased and 
large-scale sealing disappeared around the 1970s; 
spotted seals grew in number in the Okhotsk Sea and 
they needed to find a new habitat. Also, as ice floes 
have decreased, it becomes possible to migrate from 
the Sea of Japan to the southernmost ice floes in the 
Okhotsk Sea before the breeding period starts. So, 
subadults and adults have been able to use the habitat 
of the Sea of Japan, recently (Table1). 
 
Seasonal change of migrating individuals 
 
We performed investigations on Yagishiri and Bakkai 
Bay from November 2003 to May 2004 when there was 
regularity in the seasonal changes and we were able to 
obtain the most complete records. The outcome is 
presented in Figure 2. The results show that the visiting 
period of the spotted seals started a half month earlier in 
Bakkai Bay than on Yagishiri, and the leaving period 
was a half month later in Bakkai Bay than on Yagishiri. 
The water temperature during the visiting period on 
Yagishiri was about 14°C, and was 8°C during the 
leaving period. We have no analysis for Bakkai because 
we could not get water temperature data. We observed 
two peaks, one at the beginning of January and one at 
the beginning of May on Yagishiri. However, the 
number of migrating individuals suddenly decreased 
from the peak in January and continued gradually until 
the leaving period in Bakkai Bay. In Yagishiri, the 
peaks come at the beginning of January and May, and 
the same number of migrating individuals were 
observed every year. Just before the second peak in 
May, there was a sudden increase at the end of April, 
resulting in a different pattern of seasonal change 
between Yagishiri (Kouno, unpublished data) and 
Bakkai Bay (Itou, unpublished data). 
 
To summarize the seasonal change, the difference in 
patterns between the two regions is a lag of half a 
month in the visiting and leaving periods. Both 
feeding habitats in the summer and, in Yagishiri, the 
water temperature, was the same every year at the 
visiting and leaving periods, so it could possibly 
depend on the water temperature. Also, the two-peak 
characteristic was observed only in Yagishiri, and the 
number of individuals were the same in each peak. 
Therefore, we can inquire why such a seasonal 
change can be observed by making clear which 
individuals are migrating during the second peak, 
and how spotted seals move to each haul-out site in 
the Sea of Japan. Several common points were 
observed: the decrease in the number of individuals 
during the breeding period, a tendency of earlier 
visiting and later leaving, and an annual increase in 
the number of migrating individuals.

Movement pattern of spotted seals 
 
In Yagishiri, we caught an immature male spotted 
seal on May 23, 2008, and we put Argos telemetry 
on it. Results show that after this individual stayed a 
couple of days in Yagishiri, it moved to Aniva Bay 
in Sakhalin, and at one time, it travelled 100 km 
 
within a day (Fig. 3). Though most of the haul-out 
sites are found on the east coast of Sakhalin, and as 
this individual was staying in Aniva Bay, it is 
probable that the individuals migrating to the Sea of 
Japan are found in feeding habitats relatively closer 
to haul-out sites in winter. Since the tracked 
individual was able to travel such a distance at one

time, we suppose that the seal had a definite 
destination. It would be important to know for future 
studies that if seals change their habitat, what are the 
factors that determine their feeding habitat? The 
internal telemetry sensor revealed that spotted seals 
can dive down to a maximum depth of 90 m, but 
usually no deeper than 50 m. It also showed that they 
often dive from the evening until nighttime, and stay 
mostly on the haul-out starting at dawn. However, 
they dive and haul-out much less frequently from the 
latter half of July (Fig. 4), so there is a different 
pattern of behavior in the water according to the 
season (Kobayashi, unpublished data). In the future, 
by analyzing data in detail and accumulating 
information about their predators, we hope to 
understand what their prey is and how frequently 
they prey on it. 
 
Future Issues 
 
Problems to be solved in the future 
 
In the future, by making clear the feeding habitat of 
the individuals migrating to the Sea of Japan of 
Hokkaido, it will be possible to know the 
relationship between these individuals and the group 
of Tartar Strait or Sakhalin. Also, as there are 
different seasonal patterns regarding the number of 
individuals in Yagishiri and Bakkai Bay, by knowing 
how frequently the movements occur at each haul-
out site in the Sea of Japan or what characteristics 
they have, that is, the difference between males and 
females, or age classes, will help us to understand the 
importance of each haul-out site on the Sea of Japan. 
Moreover, knowing that Todo Island of Rebun used 
to be a haul-out site only during the winter period in 
past years, but now is the site of year-round 
habitation where even pup births are reported, it is 
considered that Rebun is a principal haul-out site in 
the Sea of Japan. So, although we keep monitoring 
other haul-out sites for long terms, it is important to 
know the significance and role of Rebun in the Sea 
of Japan. 
 
Change in quality and distribution of ice floes 
 
From information obtained from the Japan 
Meteorological Agency, this author found that drift ice 
reached the coast of Hokkaido and remained late into 
2008 in the Okhotsk Sea. When I made a survey by 
plane at the end of March, which is the breeding 
period for spotted seals, I saw that the ice of the floes 
were so thin that I could see through them. The ice 
would not be thick enough for seals to haul-out. Seals 
usually haul-out the edge of ice floes filled with 
canals; there were hardly such ice floes. I contacted 
the Meteorological Agency to find out the movements 
of the ice floes in March and April, 2007, the breeding 
period for seals, when it revealed that the ice floes 
were suddenly disappearing from the Okhotsk Sea in 
the middle of breeding period. It means that the ice 
was so thin and light that it melted fast and moved 
quickly and dramatically. In this sense, the quality of 
ice floes recently may be getting worse.

Effects of biology on seals 
 
First, as a direct effect, pups can be lost or drowned 
because the ice floes of bad quality can melt while 
they are being born or nursed on the ice. If the parent 
cannot find an adequate ice floe for birthing, pups 
may be born in the water.  Of course, a newborn pup 
can swim, but not enough to survive. If there is only 
a small amount of good ice, the breeding site will 
become too crowded due to competition, and if a 
natural enemy comes to prey, the risk must be 
considerable. It can be assumed that as infant 
mortality increases, aging may occur, and may affect 
the population dynamics.  
 
Indirect effects may be much more serious. If ice 
floes decrease or disappear in the Okhotsk Sea, the 
productivity may decline, and accordingly, the fish 
and their prey will decrease. As the sea level rises 
because of the deterioration or decrease of the ice 
floes, the haul-out sites of the spotted seal may 
become scarce leading to the struggle for haul-outs 
and food. Finally, a large-scale extinction could 
occur. In the end, it is assumed that the decrease of 
ice floes could affect, directly or indirectly, all seals, 
not only spotted seals dependent on ice floes 
physically and biologically, but also harbor seals in 
the Pacific Ocean.

The Sea of Okhotsk is one of the main regions of 
pinniped distribution in the Russian Far East.  There 
are 7 species of the pinnipeds living: 2 species 
(Steller sea lion and northern fur seal) are 
represented by the Otariidae family and 5 species 
(bearded seal, ringed seal, spotted seal, harbor seal 
and ribbon seal) are members of the Phocidae family. 
  
In the second part of the last century, all species of true 
seals, except harbor seals, were the objects of harvest, 
and were caught year round.  Consequently, these 
species were studied as well.  However, in 1994 ship-
based harvests of ice seals in the Sea of Okhotsk ended, 
resulting in a reduced level of study.  
  
The main species for harvest in the Sea of Okhotsk 
was ringed seal, annual catches of which reached 
 
almost 100,000 individuals in certain years. The 
catch quantity of other pinnipeds was also impressive 
(Table 1).  The most intensive harvest began in 1955, 
when the Far East fishing fleet flotilla was 
developed.  The strength of the harvest led to a rapid 
decline in the number of seals.  For example, the 
number of ringed seals in the Sea of Okhotsk 
dropped from 1 million to 600,000 from the mid-
1950s to the mid-1960s.  In 1969, some limitations 
on the seal harvest were enacted. 
 
The last census of true seal populations in the Sea of 
Okhotsk was conducted in 1990 (Table 2).  It can be 
seen from the table that the decrease in the number of 
seals stopped for nearly all species, and that the 
number of ringed seals has yet to fully rebound.

Eared seals, compared to the situation nowadays, 
have been better studied in recent years.  Because the 
fur seal is regarded as a harvestable species, constant 
studies were focused on identifying the maximum 
sustainable yield.  The Steller sea lion is a threatened 
species, particularly in the western Aleutian region, 
and this has motivated special attention devoted to 
research. 
 
Steller Sea Lions  
  
At the present time there are 14 major Steller sea lion 
(Eumetopias jubatus) rookeries in Russia, where 
annual reproduction of this species takes place  
(Fig. 1).  Only 3 rookeries are located outside of the 
Sea of Okhotsk.  Of the remaining 11, 7 are located on 
the Kuril Islands. In the 1970s, populations decreased 
rapidly, especially on the Kuril Islands.  In the 1980s 
the numbers stablized at the lowest level ever seen 
during the whole period of research.  The reasons for 
the population decline are still unknown, but the 
numbers have yet to recover.  At the same time, 
during the several last years, there has been a trend of 
slow increase in pups born on the Kuril Islands. 
 
Compared to the depressed condition of sea lion 
conditions in the Sea of Okhotsk, the rapidly growing 
population of sea lions on Robben (Tyuleny) Island on 
the eastern end of Sakhalin (Fig. 1) seems rather 
unusual. Sea lions were regularly observed on this 
island at least from the end of the 19th century, but the 
rookery only became reproductive in the 1970s, when 
about one to two pups started to appear almost 
annually.  In 1980 six pups were born; since then, the 
number of newborn pups has begun to increase rapidly 
(Fig. 2).  Currently, the Robben Island sea lion 
rookery can be described as flourishing. In 2006 the 
number of pups there exceeded 600 individuals. 
 
Nearly half of the Sea of Okhotsk Steller sea lions 
reproduce on the Kuril Islands, where 7 reproductive 
rookeries are located, among them there are 5 
rookeries, on which the number of pups born 
annually ranges from 200 to 800 (Fig. 3).

Northern Fur Seals 
  
In total, there are 4 reproductive northern fur seal 
(Callorhinus ursinus) rookeries in Russian waters: 
the Kommandor Islands, Lovushki and Srednego 
Islands (both part of the Kuril Islands) and Robben 
Island. On the Kuril Islands, fur seal rookeries are in 
excellent condition; the number of pups born 
annually is about 20,000. The wintering grounds of 
fur seals, which reproduce on the islands, are 
generally situated on the Yamato Bank, in the central 
part of the Sea of Japan. Part of the population 
winters in the waters to the west of Japan. 
  
Recently, an increase in the number of individuals 
was registered on Robben Island. From 1987–1994 
Primary production/Zooplankton/Marine mammals 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  85 
about 16,000–20,000 calves were born annually on 
the island (Fig. 4). In 2006, the number of pups was 
calculated at 33,000. Nevertheless, this figure is still 
far from the 55,000 pups that were born here 
annually in the middle of the 1960s. The Kuril 
Islands population is not affected by harvest. On 
Robben Island, on the other hand, about 1,000 fur 
seals are harvested for fur every year; 2- to 5-year-
old males are the ideal target for commercial catches 
on this island. 
 
Bearded Seals 
 
In the sealing years, this species (Erignathus 
barbatus) was mostly “ignored” and its numbers 
were not significantly impacted by the fisheries. 
Nowadays, this species is being caught in small 
numbers in the coastal areas of the northern part of 
the Sea of Okhotsk. In winter and spring, bearded 
seals are found on ice cover in relatively shallow 
waters (Fig. 5). In the late summer and autumn 
periods, bearded seals also keep near the shelf areas, 
and typically occur in waters less than 200 m depth. 
During this season, they form haul-outs on Sakhalin, 
the Shantar Islands and the northern coast of the Sea 
of Okhotsk. 
 
Ringed Seals 
  
The ringed seal (Phoca hispida) is the most 
numerous seal in the Sea of Okhotsk, and is widely 
distributed. The largest number of ringed seals can 
be found in the western part of the sea. In the area of 
the Shantar Islands, where in the beginning of 
summer the ice remains for a long time, ringed seals 
form mass molted gatherings in June. After the ice 
recedes, the ringed seals disperse widely in the 
coastal areas of the sea, where they accumulate fat 
before wintering by intensive feeding on different 
crustacean and schooling fish species. 
 
Spotted Seals 
 
Currently, spotted seals (also known as largha seals, 
Phoca largha) in the Sea of Okhotsk number about 
200,000. The spotted seal is widely distributed in the 
waters of the whole sea, forming two separate 
populations, which are spatially well-segregated 
during the reproductive season. During the 
reproductive period, one population center is situated 
in the northern part of the sea in Shelikhov Bay; the 
center of the other is situated along the eastern coast 
of Sakhalin.

After the retreat of the ice cover, the spotted seal 
disperses along the coasts, forming large haul-outs, 
which can reach up to several thousand seals. The 
largest haul-outs are on the western coast of the 
Kamchatka Peninsula, and on Sakhalin (Fig. 6). 
  
Currently, the spotted seal is the only representative 
of the true seals which is still harvested on the 
coastal haul-outs at the end of summer–early autumn 
on South Sakhalin and in the northren part of the Sea 
of Okhotsk. 
 
Harbor Seals 
 
Within the Sea of Okhotsk, harbor seals (Phoca 
vitulina) are found only on the Kuril Islands. Their 
population is not large and the species is registered in 
the Red Data Book of Russia. On the Kuril Islands, 
harbor seals are unevenly distributed. The largest 
number can be found on the Iturup, Shikotan and 
Habomai islands. In 2000 the whole territory of the 
Kuril Islands was carefully monitored, and about 
3,000 individuals were counted. The inter-annual 
dynamics of harbor seal numbers indicate that the 
number of the seals on the Kuril Islands is roughly 
constant and that there is no danger to harbor seal 
survival in this region. The harbor seal is generally a 
non-migratory species, but it regularly travels locally 
between adjacent islands. 
 
Ribbon Seals 
  
This species of seal (Phoca fasciata) is the least 
studied in the Sea of Okhotsk. The reason for this is 
that during the ice period of the year life cycle, this 
seal is not connected to the land, and its summer-
time habitat is situated in the pelagic area. This 
species is the earliest to mature, which explains the 
rapid growth of its population. Some females become 
mature at the age of 1 year, and at the age of 2 years 
most seals are ready to reproduce.

During the ice period, the highest density of ribbon 
seals is found in two areas of the Sea of Okhotsk: on 
the Kashevarov Bank, in the northern part of the sea, 
and along the east Sakhalin coastline. Reproduction 
for the majority of these populations takes place in 
these areas. Ribbon seals, after their departure from 
the ice, move into the open sea areas; some part of 
the population migrates towards the Pacific Ocean in 
summer. 
 
Each species of seal is characterized by specific 
diets. In all areas of the Sea of Okhotsk the most 
frequently encountered types of prey of Steller sea 
lions are Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus 
monopterigius), walleye pollock (Theragra 
chalcogramma), salmon (Onchorynchus sp.), 
sculpins (Cottidae), and cephalopods. Fur seals 
mainly feed on different types of fishes and squids. 
The feeding base of the bearded seal is represented 
by benthic invertebrates. The diet of the ribbon seal 
consists mostly of walleye pollock and squids. The 
ringed seal feeds on crustaceans and small fishes. 
The spotted seal diet includes different types of fish, 
cephalopods and crustaceans. In autumn the spotted 
seal concentrates in river mouths where they feed 
largely on stream-bound salmon. The ringed seal and 
the spotted seal can be described as having regional-
specific feeding, and the structure of their diets in the 
northern and southern part of the sea varies 
considerably. The harbor seal eats different types of 
fishes and invertebrates which live in the shallow 
coastal waters of the Kuril Islands. All species 
display seasonal changes of the feeding structure. 
 
In recent years, research on true seals in the Sea of 
Okhotsk carried out by Russian zoologists were, to 
the great extent, devoted to studying the potential 
impact of oil and gas development on the shelf of 
northeastern Sakhalin. The drilling platforms here 
are close to the coast, where seals form large beach 
rookeries. One of the rookeries is functioning in 
Piltun Bay, 25 km from an oil rig. There are 3 
species of the seals located on this rookery: spotted 
seal, ringed seal and bearded seal, of which the first 2 
are the most abundant. It is worth mentioning that the 
ringed seal haul-out here is the largest one known for 
this species. The number of the true seals on the 
haul-outs increases from summer to autumn (Fig. 7). 
 
Intensive research performed on the rookery in Piltun 
Bay in 1999 did not indicate any negative influence 
of oil and gas development on the seal haul-out. Still, 
some potential risk for the haul-out exists. A severe 
accident occurring in the area could seriously 
threaten the adjacent haul-outs. 
 
In recent years there has been a low level of ice 
coverage in the Sea of Okhotsk due to warming of the 
climate. It is, as yet, unclear what effect this has on the 
ice-bound seal populations. However, seasonal 
migrations and distributions of seals in the northern 
parts of the Sea of Okhotsk have been affected by late 
ice formation in the autumn and early breakup in 
spring. It is also possible that a shortage of ice cover 
and its comparatively short presence can affect the 
reproductive success and pup survival of seals. 
Investigation of this question requires further research.

Introduction  
 
The harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is a 
small cetacean distributed in temperate and subarctic 
waters of the Northern Hemisphere.  They have three 
major distribution areas, the North Atlantic, North 
Pacific and Black Sea to Sea of Azof (Fig.1, Gaskin, 
1984). 
  
They are top predators in coastal ecosystems, but 
today, are exposed to environmental pollutants and 
fisheries pressures (Jefferson and Curry, 1994; 
Beineke et al., 2005; Jepson et al., 2005). Especially, 
population reduction due to incidental catch has been 
a growing serious problem in a part of the North 
Atlantic (Woodley and Read, 1991; Trippel et al., 
1996). It is important to understand their intraspecific 
genetic structure for appropriate management of 
harbour porpoises in such an environment.  
 
In the North Pacific, two major local populations are 
known in the north and south coasts of North 
America, in the area designating the Northeast Pacific 
(Rosel et al., 1995).  Moreover, some subpopulations 
in these two regions have been reported (Chivers et 
al., 2002).  However, it is difficult to understand the 
genetic structure across the North Pacific because no 
population genetics study has been conducted in the 
Northwest Pacific, including Japan. 
  
The Japanese harbour porpoise is distributed around 
Hokkaido to the northern mainland of Honshu in 
winter and east of Hokkaido to the Sea of Okhotsk in 
summer (Gaskin et al., 1993).  Given the breeding 
season of the Japanese harbour porpoise, the Sea of 
Okhotsk is likely to be important as their breeding 
area.  Thus, the present study is aiming to estimate 
the mitochondrial DNA variation of harbour 
porpoises in Japanese waters as a first step to 
understanding their genetic structure in the 
Northwest Pacific. 
 
Materials and Methods  
 
Samples and DNA extraction 
 
A total of 56 tissue samples were obtained from 
stranded, incidentally caught or captive porpoises in 
Japan (Fig. 2). Tissues of muscle or skin were 
preserved in 95% ethanol or stored at –30°C. Total 
genomic DNA was extracted using Gentra Puregene 
kits (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s 
protocol. 
  
In addition, all nucleotide sequences in the Northeast 
Pacific of 40 individuals from Alaska and Strait of 
Georgia (NEP5), 52 individuals from San Juan Island 
and Vancouver Island (NEP4), 62 individuals from 
Washington and Columbia River (NEP3), 17 
individuals from Oregon (NEP2), and 52 individuals 
from San Francisco and Monterey Bay (NEP1) 
(accession numbers AF461818 – AF461891, Chivers 
et al., 2002) were collected from GenBank. 
 
Mitochondrial control-region sequences 
 
The 462 base pairs (bps) of the hypervariable portion 
from the 5’ end of the mitochondrial (mt) DNA 
control region were amplified using polymerase 
chain reaction with primer L15824 (5’-
CCTCACTCCTCCCTAAGACT-3’) and H16265 
(5’-GCCCGGTGCGAGAAGAGG-3’) (Rosel et al., 
1999). A reaction mixture at 20 μL contained 2 μL of 
10x buffer, 0.25 μL of each primer, 0.15 mM dNTP 
and 0.02 U/μL Taq DNA polymerase. Amplification 
was carried out on an ASTEC PC320, 708 or 816 
thermal cycler with a thermal profile consisting of an 
initial denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, followed by 30 
cycles of 50 s at 94°C, 50 s at 55°C and 50 s at 72°C, 
and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The 
amplified products were purified using a DNA 
purification kit, and cycle-sequenced using an ABI 
BigDye® Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit,  
 
Primary production/Zooplankton/Marine mammals 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  91 
following the manufacturer’s protocol. All samples 
were sequenced in both DNA strands with the 
primers used in the amplification, and sequence 
alignment was corrected by eye. 
 
Analysis of mitochondrial DNA variation 
 
Nucleotide and haplotype diversities (Nei, 1987) 
were estimated for all populations. An analysis of 
molecular variance (AMOVA) was conducted to 
measure the hierarchical genetic differentiation 
among populations using the program ARLEQUIN 
ver.3.1 (Excoffier and Schneider, 2005). The 
AMOVA calculates φ
ST
,
 
an index of population 
subdivision. The significance of φ
ST 
was tested by 
multiple permutations of the original data sets. A 
phylogenetic relationship among mtDNA haplotypes 
was performed with the neighbor-joining (NJ) 
method on a matrix of the pairwise distance, based 
on Kimura’s two-parameter model (Saitou and Nei, 
1987), using the finless porpoise (Neophocoena 
phocaenoides) as out group, with the program 
MEGA ver.4 (Tamura et al., 2007). The reliability of 
internal tree branches was assessed by 1,000 
bootstrap resamplings. A minimum spanning 
network of mtDNA haplotypes was constructed 
using the program TCS ver.1.21 (Clement et al., 
2000). Isolation by distance, known as the population 
genetic pattern, was estimated by regression analysis 
between φ
ST 
and the geographic distance among all 
pairwise populations, using Isolation by Distance 
Web Service (Jensen et al., 2005).

Results 
 
Sequence analysis of 358 bps in the 5’ 462 bps 
sequenced portion of the mtDNA control region 
revealed 23 variable sites, which defined 19 
haplotypes among Japanese porpoises (Table 1). 
 
Haplotype and nucleotide diversities were 0.78 and 
0.006, respectively, in Japan. The haplotype diversity 
ranged from 0.64 to 0.91 and nucleotide diversity 
ranged from 0.006 to 0.016. Both diversities were 
lower in Japan and NEP5 than the other populations, 
and became higher toward south of the Pacific Rim. 
The reduced value in NEP2 might be caused by 
small sample size. 
 
In the NJ tree for a total of 67 haplotypes, two 
geographic clusters, groups I and II, were confirmed, 
 
but not divided completely (Fig. 3). Although some 
haplotypes were endemic to the Japanese population, 
many other haplotypes were distributed across a 
broad geographic range and the reliability values of 
the tree were low. 
 
A minimum spanning network resolved two main 
haplotype groups (groups I and II, Fig. 4), and these 
two groups were compatible with those of the NJ tree 
(Fig. 3). The Northeast Pacific populations had both 
haplotype groups, but the Japanese population had 
only group I. The most common haplotype, 
haplotype 49, was found in all sampling locations 
and was focal in a star-like group I genealogy. The 
second most common haplotype, haplotype3, was 
focal in the group II.

The AMOVA showed a significant difference for φ
ST 
between Japan and the Northeast Pacific, except for 
NEP5, which was significantly differentiated from 
the other populations, except for Japan and NEP2 
(Table 2). An insignificant value between NEP5 and 
NEP2 may be due to the small sample size in NEP2. 
Overall, differentiation increased southward in the 
Pacific Rim. 
  
There was significant correlation between genetic 
distance for φ
ST
 and geographic distance among all 
pairwise populations (Fig. 5). This relationship 
suggests a restricted gene flow by distance in the 
North Pacific. 
 
Discussion 
   
Although two main geographic clusters were 
confirmed on the NJ tree of haplotypes in the 
harbour porpoise, its branching reliability was not 
high with weak to moderate bootstrap support. In 
addition, most of the observed haplotypes were 
distributed across a broad geographic range, although 
some were endemic to Japan. These results suggest 
the occurrence of a certain level of gene flow over 
the distribution range in the North Pacific.  
 
A minimum spanning network also resolved two 
haplotype groups. A star-like genealogy of both 
haplotype groups suggests recent population 
expansion of the harbour porpoise in the North 
Pacific, as a whole. Most populations in the 
Northeast Pacific had these two groups. Although the 
Japanese population had only group I haplotypes, 
AMOVA did not show significant differentiation 
between Japan and NEP5, Alaska to Strait of 
Georgia. Moreover, there was a significantly positive 
relationship between genetic and geographic 
distances, suggesting a restricted gene flow with 
isolation by distance. 
 
Both the genetic differentiation and haplotype 
diversity data obtained may indicate a contiguous 
 
expansion of their range from south to north along 
the North Pacific Rim, and the occurrence of the 
Japanese population in the Northeast Pacific 
populations after bottleneck. This also is supported 
by lower genetic diversities north of the Pacific Rim. 
Rosel et al. (1995) also reported lower genetic 
diversity of the harbour porpoise in the northern 
location of the Northeast Pacific, and they inferred 
that this phenomenon reflected historical 
colonization by a small group having a part of their 
lineage in an ancestral population. 
 
No difference between the Japan and Alaska to the 
Strait of Georgia population despite the very long 
distance is puzzling. The Sea of Okhotsk may 
become a key area to resolving this problem. 
However, the role of the Sea of Okhotsk on gene 
flow of the harbour porpoise in the Northwest Pacific 
remains unknown because there are no population 
genetic data in the Bering Sea, around the Aleutian 
Islands and coastal Russia. In the future, studies 
using the data from these areas will help in 
appropriate management of the harbour porpoise in 
the Northwest Pacific.

Introduction 
 
Recently, the Sea of Okhotsk has been recognized as 
a primary iron source region to the northwestern 
Pacific (Nishioka et al., 2007). Cold and dense water, 
which is referred to as Dense Shelf Water (DSW), is 
formed as a result of brine rejection from sea ice on 
the northwestern shelf in the Sea of Okhotsk.  Iron, 
together with other chemical particles, is considered 
to be incorporated into DSW through, for example, 
tidal mixing (Nakatsuka et al., 2004). DSW, 
including iron, is transported southward by the East 
Sakhalin Current in the intermediate layer off 
Sakhalin, and flows out into the Pacific through the 
Kuril straits. Thus iron is supplied to the 
northwestern Pacific. 
 
We intend to model the iron circulation and 
distribution from the Sea of Okhotsk to the 
northeastern Pacific in the near future.  We have 
constructed an Ocean General Circulation Model 
(OGCM) on which we will overlay an iron model.  
In this paper, we describe the OGCM and show some 
results of the OGCM, with the above picture of iron 
circulation in mind.  Then, we show tracer 
experiments in which a tracer is injected in winter at 
the sea surface in the northwestern part of the Sea of 
Okhotsk to trace DSW in the model.  
 
OGCM 
 
The model used is Iced COCO ver. 3.4 (Hasumi et 
al., 2004). It is the ice–ocean coupled model 
developed at the center for Climate System Research, 
University of Tokyo. In the ocean model, the vertical 
coordinate system is a hybrid of sigma (between the 
sea surface and a depth of 31 m) and z level 
coordinate (below 31 m). The partial step 
formulation is adopted for bottom topography 
(Adcroft et al., 1997). For the tracer equations, the 
advection schemes are the Quadratic Upstream 
Interpolation for Convective Kinematics with 
Estimate Streaming Terms (Leonard, 1979) and the 
Uniformly Third-Order Polynominal Interpolation 
Algorithm (Leonard et al., 1993), and isopycnal 
diffusion (Cox, 1987), thickness diffusion (Gent et 
al., 1995), and the turbulence closure of Noh and 
Kim (1999) are used. The isopycnal and the 
thickness diffusion coefficients are 1.0 × 10
6
 cm
2
/s 
and 3.0 × 10
6
 cm
2
/s, respectively, and the 
background vertical viscosity and diffusion 
coefficients are 1.0 cm
2
/s and 0.1 cm
2
/s, respectively. 
In the ice model, the thermodynamic part is the zero 
layer model (Semtner, 1976), and the dynamic part is 
the elastic-viscous-plastic formulation of Hunke and 
Dukowicz (1997) with two-category thickness 
representation. 
 
The model domain spans from 136°E to 179.5°W 
and from 39°N to 63.5°N. The horizontal resolution 
is 0.5° both in zonal and meridional directions. There 
are 51 levels in the vertical direction with thickness 
increasing from 1 m at the sea surface to 1000 m in 
the deepest layer. 
 
The OGCM is forced at the sea surface by the daily 
mean climatology data set (wind stress, freshwater 
flux, radiation, wind speed, temperature, and 
humidity) from the Ocean Model Intercomparison 
Project. The freshwater flux data consist of 
evaporation, precipitation, and river runoff. While 
the freshwater flux is much larger at the northern 
mouth of the Mamiya (Tartar) Strait than its 
vicinities throughout the year, probably owing to the 
runoff from the Amur River, the runoff ought to drop 
or stop in winter because of freezing of the river. 
Therefore, we subtract the annual mean (which we 
regard as approximate river runoff) from the data at 
each grid the north of 53°N and the west of 142°E in 
winter (from December 15 to April 15) and the 
amount of the subtraction is evenly distributed to the 
rest of the days. 
 
Temperature and salinity are restored to the World 
Ocean Atlas data (WOA) on the 6 grids from the 
boundaries, and the sea surface height is restored to 
Current dynamics 
 
98 PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
the basin-wide model outputs on the 3 grids from the 
boundaries. Temperature and salinity are also 
restored to the WOA at grids deeper than 2000 m. 
The sea surface salinity (SSS) is restored to the 
WOA. From December to April, the SSS is not 
restored to the WOA in the northern half of the Sea 
of Okhotsk, as the SSS around the northwestern part 
of the Sea of Okhotsk in the WOA is too low in 
winter probably owing to the spurious effects of the 
Amur River runoff. 
 
Although circulations in and around the Sea of 
Okhotsk are strongly affected by tidal mixing along 
the Kuril Islands, this OGCM does not include tidal 
effects. Therefore, we increased the vertical diffusion 
coefficients as tidal effects along the Kuril Islands, 
where the coefficients are set at 500 cm
2
/s at the 
bottom and decrease upward. 
 
The OGCM is integrated for 116 years from the rest 
with the climatological temperature and salinity 
(WOA). The next section describes monthly means 
of the results in the last 1 year. 
 
Results 
 
Figure 1 shows barotropic streamlines in winter and 
summer. There is a cyclonic gyre in the center of the 
Sea of Okhotsk, which is strong in winter and weak 
in summer. In summer, in the southern part of the 
Sea near the Kuril Islands, the values are positive and 
some anticyclonic circulations are seen. These 
circulations and their seasonal variations are 
consistent with previous studies (e.g., Ohshima et al., 
2004; Uchimoto et al., 2007). 
 
Figure 2 shows an ice concentration map in 
February. This shape of ice distribution is very 
similar to satellite observations (e.g., Ohshima et al., 
2006). We should note that the concentration is 
somewhat low (less than 0.95) along the northern 
and northwestern coast. This low concentration is 
thought to be due to coastal polynyas, where sea ice 
is mainly produced and therefore much brine is 
rejected. This implies that DSW is produced in the 
OGCM.  
 
Next, some features on and about the 26.8σ
θ
 surface 
are shown. The 26.8σ
θ
 surface is a typical surface in 
the intermediate layer. Figure 3 shows the depth. 
Although the model result is somewhat shallower 
than the climatology (Itoh et al., 2003) almost 
everywhere in the Sea of Okhotsk, the model result 
has a general resemblance to the climatology. One of 
the salient features in the climatology is a deep zone 
(~300 m) in the Kuril Basin. In the OGCM, the deep 
zone is marginally represented; the area is smaller 
and the depth is shallower (~200 m). Another salient 
feature in the climatology is a deep region in the 
southeastern part of the Sea of Okhotsk. The deep 
region is represented in the OGCM, and it extends 
toward the northwest, the same as in the climatology.

The 26.8σ
θ
 surface in the OGCM outcrops in winter 
around the northwestern shelf (not shown). Cold water 
extends southward from the shelf along Sakhalin 
Island (Fig. 4). In the center and eastern part of the 
Sea, potential temperature is relatively high because 
warm water from the Pacific enters the Sea of 
Okhotsk. Temperature there is slightly higher, by 
about 0.8°C, in the OGCM than in the climatology. 
 
The thickness of the 26.8σ
θ
 layer that is defined as 
the distance between the two surfaces of 26.75σ
θ
 and 
26.85σ
θ
 is shown in Figure 5. The thick layer in the 
eastern part of the Sea is represented in the OGCM, 
but the thick layer in the southern part is, 
unfortunately, not represented. 
 
In summary, the OGCM represents circulations and 
features of the 26.8σ
θ
 in the Sea of Okhotsk, of course 
not perfectly, but acceptably well, considering its 
coarse resolution. The area most poorly represented in 
the OGCM is the Kuril Basin. While the cause for it is 
not apparent at present, a possible cause is the 
parameterization of tidal mixing effects along the 
Kuril Islands. We should investigate more appropriate 
values and/or vertical profiles of the vertical diffusion 
coefficients using tidal mixing effects.

April at the sea surface in the northwestern shelf is denoted

concentration is larger than 0.1 are shaded. 
 
Tracer experiments 
 
To trace dense water that is produced as a result of 
cooling and brine rejection around the northwestern 
shelf, we conducted tracer experiments, where a 
 
passive tracer is restored to unity at the sea surface in 
the northwestern shelf (Fig. 6) from January to April. 
 
Figure 6 displays tracer distribution on the 26.8σ
θ
 
surface 11 years after the start. The tracer injected 
near the northwestern corner of the Sea moves 
southward along the western coast on the shelf and 
then eastward around 55°N. It moves southward 
along Sakhalin Island and goes toward the Kuril 
Islands. Some part of the tracer recirculates within 
the Sea of Okhotsk, and the other parts move into the 
Pacific through the Kuril Straits where they are 
transported eastward in the North Pacific. 
 
Along 55°N the tracer leaves the shelf and proceeds 
on the slope.  At first, the tracer appears in the vertical 
section along 55°N, with a stronger concentration near 
the bottom in the western part, creeps eastward, and 
then goes down the slope.  However, it does not reach 
the bottom on the slope, but remains in the 
intermediate layer. This picture is consistent with 
observed DSW which is produced on the northwestern 
shelf and is transported in the intermediate layer, in a 
depth of a few hundreds meters. 
 
We also conducted the same experiment but with no 
tidal mixing effects along the Kuril Islands. In the no 
mixing case, the tracer does not sink to the 
intermediate layer on the slope, but remains at almost 
the same depth as the shelf bottom (not shown).  The 
difference between the two cases indicates that tidal 
mixing along the Kuril Islands indirectly pushes 
DSW to a depth of a few hundred meters, i.e., the 
intermediate layer. 
 
Concluding Remarks 
 
We have shown some results of our OGCM which 
covers the Sea of Okhotsk and the northwestern 
Pacific. Considering its coarse resolution, we think 
that the OGCM can represent circulations and active 
tracer distributions in the intermediate layer well. 
Tracer experiments show that dense and cold water 
(DSW) produced on the northwestern shelf in the Sea 
of Okhotsk flows southward along Sakhalin in the 
intermediate layer. 
 
We will overlay an iron model on the OGCM and 
investigate the iron circulation. Since iron is thought 
to be transported with DSW, the results suggest that 
the OGCM is likely to be useful for iron circulation 
modeling.

Introduction 
 
The global ocean dataset shows that water 
temperature has significantly increased during the 
past 50 years (Levitus et al., 2005).  Since the 
increase in ocean temperature is prominent at upper 
levels, the cause of the warming seems to be related 
to global warming.  
 
Recently, it was reported that a warming trend is 
found in the western North Pacific, including the Sea 
of Okhotsk at the intermediate layer, which is not 
affected by local surface heat flux (Nakanowatari et 
al., 2007).  Since the warming trend originates from 
the Sea of Okhotsk, which is known to be the 
ventilation source of North Pacific Intermediate 
Water (NPIW) (e.g., Talley, 1991), it is suggested 
that overturning in the North Pacific has weakened 
during the past 50 years. 
 
On the other hand, ocean temperature at 40°N in the 
western North Pacific has significantly decreased in 
the upper and middle layers during the past 50 years 
(Levitus et al., 2005).  The significant decrease in 
ocean temperature occurs at isopycnal level (e.g., 
Wong et al., 1999;  Nakanowatari et al., 2007). Thus, 
it is considered that cooling in the intermediate layer 
is related to the change in water mass property. 
 
Several studies have shown that the significant 
decrease in upper ocean temperature in the western 
North Pacific is related to the change in surface heat 
flux, Ekman transport, and ocean circulation 
associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
(PDO) (e.g., Miller and Schneider, 2000).  However, 
the effect of atmospheric forcing on the 50-yr scale 
decrease in ocean temperature at intermediate layers 
has not been investigated. 
 
In this study we investigate the effect of atmospheric 
forcing on a 50-yr scale change in intermediate water 
temperature in the western North Pacific by using 
observational data and hindcast data of an eddy 
resolving sea ice coupled Ocean General Circulation 
Model (OGCM) driven by realistic atmospheric 
forcing. 
 
Data and Methods 
 
Model description and experiment 
 
The hindcast data used in this study is integrated by 
the sea ice coupled OGCM developed at the 
Meteorological Research Institute (MRI.COM: 
Ishikawa et al., 2005).  The ocean model is described 
by a primitive-equation system with a vertical depth 
coordinate, free surface, Boussinesq and hydrostatic 
approximations. The model domain occupies the 
entire North Pacific from 100°E to 75°W and from 
15°S to 65°N. Horizontal resolution is 1/12° (eddy 
resolving) in the zonal and meridional direction, 
respectively. Thus, ocean circulation in the Sea of 
Okhotsk and narrow features in the Oyashio front 
and Kuroshio–Oyashio confluence can be resolved.  
 
In this model, the sea ice model is coupled to 
realistically simulate vertical mixing in the Sea of 
Okhotsk. Thermodynamics is based on Mellor and 
Kantha (1989), and dynamics is based on elastic-
viscous-plastic rheology (Hunke and Ducowicz, 
1997). In addition, the tidal mixing process is 
represented in the form of parameterization of the 
vertical diffusive coefficient (St. Laurent et al., 2002). 
   
As a boundary condition for the hindcast experiment 
of the sea ice coupled model, 6-h NCEP-NCAR 
reanalysis data (Kalnay et al., 1996) are used. Heat

flux is calculated by bulk formula (Kara et al., 2000). 
Freshwater flux is estimated from E – P + river 
runoff. Sea surface salinity (SSS) is restored with an 
8-day damping timescale to avoid the SSS drifting 
problem.  
 
Observational data sets 
 
Temperature and salinity are taken mainly from the 
World Ocean Database 2001 (Conkright et al., 2002). 
In addition, we used observational data obtained by 
the Japan–Russia–United States international joint 
study of the Sea of Okhotsk from 1998 to 2004 and 
data archived by the Japan Oceanographic Data 
Center. We also used profiling float data obtained by 
the international Argo program from 2000 to 2004. 
 
From these observational data, we made new 
isopycnal grid data for potential temperature in the 
North Pacific on the method similar to previous 
studies (Itoh et al., 2003; Nakanowatari et al., 2007). 
Annual mean climatology was calculated on a 1° × 1° 
latitude/longitude grid by a weighted averaging with 
a Gaussian window of 150 km.  Then, we calculated 
annual mean anomalies from 1955 to 2004 based on 
this climatology.  All the calculated anomalies were 
gridded by using simple averaging in a yearly 2.5° × 
2.5° grid box, taking account of the trade-off 
between spatial and temporal resolution. 
 
Results 
 
50-yr scale change in potential temperature in the 
North Pacific from model and observations 
 
Figure 1a shows the 1977−2004 minus 1955−1976 
difference in annual mean potential temperature at 
26.8σ
θ
 for observational data. The 50-yr scale 
decrease in potential temperature is observed in the 
western North Pacific, including the subtropical 
region. The maximum decrease is found in the 
subtropical region with 0.6°C. The decrease in 
potential temperature becomes weak at deeper depth. 
Such a decrease is successfully simulated in the 
hindcast data (Fig. 1b), although the most prominent 
decrease is found in Oyashio region.  
 
Figure 2 shows the time series of potential 
temperature at 26.8 σ
θ
 averaged over the western North 
Pacific. The potential temperature is dominated by 
multi-decadal variation like the Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation, which is characterized by the regime shift 
which occurred at the end of the 1970s (Mantua et al., 
1997; Minobe, 1997). The model quantitatively 
simulates the multidecadal variation in the 
observations. The difference in potential temperature 
for the model is –0.14, which is similar to that for the 
observations. The correlation between them is 0.67, 
which is significant at the 99% confidence level. 
 
From the difference map for observational data, 
significant warming is found around the western 
subarctic gyre, including the Sea of Okthosk 
(Fig. 1a). This warming is prominent in the western 
part of the Sea of Okhotsk, which is consistent with 
trend analyses of potential temperature on the 
isopycnal layer (Nakanowatari et al., 2007). 
However, the warming is not found in the model 
data. Although we examine the potential temperature 
at 27.0 σ
θ
, in which the most prominent warming 
trend is observed, the result is basically the same as 
in Figure 1b. Figure 2b shows the time series of 
potential temperature at 26.8 σ
θ
 averaged over the Sea 
of Okhotsk. The significant warming trend is 
dominant in the observational data, but such a long-
term variation is quite weak in this model.

Effect of Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water on the 
50-yr scale change of intermediate water 
temperature in the North Pacific  
 
We examine the role of Okhotsk Sea Intermediate 
Water (OSIW), which is known to be the cooling and  
freshening source for NPIW, on the 50-yr scale 
change in intermediate water temperature in the 
North Pacific by using model data. In order to 
investigate the water mass property change related to 
OSIW, we examine potential vorticity, which is 
defined by (f + ζ) ρ
–1
⋅∂ ρ/∂z.  Since potential vorticity 
is minimum in the Sea of Okhotsk at intermediate 
layer depth, it can be used for a proxy for OSIW 
(e.g., Mitsudera et al., 2004).  
 
Figure 3 shows the 1977−2004 minus 1955−1976 
difference in annual mean potential vorticity at 
26.8σ
θ
. A significant decrease in potential vorticity is 
found in the western North Pacific with a maximum 
in the Oyashio region. Thus, the spatial pattern of the 
significant decrease in potential vorticity is very 
similar to that in potential temperature. On the other 
hand, the potential vorticity in the Sea of Okhotsk 
has increased in contrast to the western North

Pacific. These results indicate that the cooling in the 
western North Pacific is not associated with the 
change in OSIW, but the change in ocean circulation 
in the North Pacific. 
 
Discussion and Summary 
    
In this study, we investigate the influence of 
atmospheric forcing on the change in the 
intermediate water temperature in the western North 
Pacific during the past 50 years by using 
observational data and the hindcast data of the sea 
ice ocean coupled model. The model quantitatively 
represents the 50-yr scale decrease in the western 
North Pacific. The decrease in the intermediate water 
temperature is significant at the 26.8 σ
θ
 isopycnal 
surface in the western North Pacific with a maximum 
in the Oyashio region. The variation is dominated by 
multi-decadal variation like the Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation. 
 
The decrease in the intermediate water temperature is 
accompanied by the decrease in potential vorticity. 
Since the significant decreases in potential 
temperature and potential vorticity are found in 
Oyashio region, it is suggested that the multi-decadal 
scale change in the intermediate water temperature is 
due to the variation of the Oyashio. It has been 
considered that the variation in water temperature in 
the western North Pacific is related to the change in 
wind-driven ocean circulation associated with 
westward Rossby waves (e.g., Deser et al., 1999). 
Current dynamics 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  105 
However, the multi-decadal variation in intermediate 
water originates from the western boundary. Thus, 
the western boundary current and the associated 
eddies seems to be important for 50-yr scale cooling 
in the NPIW. 
 
The coastal region of the western North Pacific is 
one of the most important fishery regions. It has been 
reported that consumption of phosphate and 
chlorophyll-a has decreased in the Oyashio region 
(Ono et al., 2002).  Thus, the effect of multi-decadal 
scale change in the Oyashio on the ecosystem and 
material circulation in the North Pacific should be 
examined by using an eddy resolving ecosystem–
biogeochemical model. 
 
In this model, the warming trend in the Sea of 
Okhotsk, reported by Itoh (2007) and Nakanowatari 
et al. (2007), is not simulated.  A possible cause for 
the unrealistic variation in the Sea of Okhotsk is that 
the amount of sea ice formation is not simulated 
accurately in the model.  A restoring of sea surface 
salinity may lead to an underestimation of dense 
shelf water formation associated with sea ice 
production.  Since observational data are very limited 
in the Sea of Okhotsk, atmospheric forcing data used 
in this study also may not be satisfactorily realistic. 
 
Recent observational data show that in the 
northwestern North Pacific, iron, which is an 
essential micronutrient for phytoplankton, may come 
from the intermediate water of the Sea of Okhotsk 
(Nishioka et al., 2007).  Thus, realistic simulation for 
the OSIW and its variability are needed for 
prediction of the marine environment and ecosystem 
in the western North Pacific.

Abstract 
 
Recent observations of the well studied dichothermal layer (with T < 0 °C) in the Sea of Okhotsk provides an 
update of its inner structure.  In the 1990s, CTD vertical soundings with 1 m resolution found cases of 
“double” or “triple” dichothermal layers on the continental slope and in the deepest part of the Sea of Okhotsk. 
The genesis of those phenomena is linked with pre-winter cooling of the water column, following convection 
and brine rejection under ice floes, and frontal interactions between water masses.  Based on new data to 
explain dichothermal structure, we note an obvious discrepancy between calculated winter convection depth 
and real descending horizons for subzero temperatures reaching few hundreds meters at the southwestern part 
of the Sea of Okhotsk.  Because of the lack of applied theory to account for vertical movements in the Sea of 
Okhotsk, an experiment using year-round mooring data was conducted for its study.  From August 2006 to 
October 2007, the N-5 mooring was deployed at the northern tip of Sakhalin Island in the western part of the 
Sea of Okhotsk at mid-shelf depth around 100 m close to the region where the East Sakhalin Current 
originates.  A year’s run of vertical current data showed clear seasonal signals averaged over the whole depth 
layer current changing from downwelling in the summer to the upwelling during cold period of the year.  The 
vertical structure showed a complex nature with heterogeneous vertical movements occurring at relatively 
shallow depths on the Sakhalin shelf.  Differences in vertical current structure are discussed for the fall, winter, 
spring, and summer seasons alternately with vertical movements through the year. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Despite the well-known Sea of Okhotsk’s cold 
intermediate or dichothermal layer (DTL), 
discovered in 19th century by Makarov (1894), 
which is characterized by subzero temperatures, little 
attention has been paid to its inner structure. The 
vertical movement of water masses from the surface 
to the bottom during winter convection after surface 
cooling, and brine rejection under ice floes, are one 
of the most obvious processes explaining the 
presence of negative temperatures at different depths 
in the Sea of Okhotsk, and especially in the western 
part, due seasonal ice distribution.  
 
Water, having a negative temperature in winter, 
located beneath the surface layer and later insulated 
during summer warming, is called the cold 
intermediate layer (dichothermal layer). Before the 
era of CTD measurements, it was difficult to obtain a 
detailed picture of the water column due to the 
scarcity of vertical measurements by water bottle 
sampling. With the introduction of CTD sensors and 
probes, the internal vertical structure of the water 
could be observed with meter and submeter vertical 
resolution (UNESCO-MHI, 1993). From detailed 
CTD measurements in the western part of Sea of 
Okhotsk, temperature inversions inside the cold 
interlayer or “double”, sometimes “triple”, cold 
interlayers have been found in mostly stable water 
stratification during the summer (Kantakov, 1995). 
Besides the discovery of dual thermal structures 
inside the dichothermal layers, the residual depth of 
convection after winter in the western part of the Sea 
of Okhotsk is often exceeded in calculations, which 
makes it necessary to explore the role of the 
mechanisms of vertical motion of water masses here. 
To explain the oceanic conditions responsible for the 
appearance of double dichothermal layers and to 
explain the over-estimation of the convection depths 
missed with calculations, we have processed a 
number of CTD data, and the vertical velocity of

water masses in the western part of the Sea of 
Okhotsk was measured.  
 
This article attempts to present new facts which will 
allow us to understand the role of the vertical motions 
of water in the subarctic Sea of Okhotsk from the points 
of view of physical and biological oceanography, 
climatic changes and hydrography of the sea. 
 
Data and Methods 
 
The study region of the Sea of Okhotsk, showing the 
arrangement of standard and additional oceanographic 
stations with the N-5 mooring site, are given in Figure 
1. The physical parameters of the marine environment 
were measured in the free drift of vessels equipped 
with different sensors such as the Neil Brown Mk-III, 
ICTD FSI and Guildline. The N-5 mooring, equipped 
with an ADP with frequency of 0.500 MHz, was 
deployed on August 27, 2006 and recovered on 
October 8, 2007 by SakhNIRO’s R/V Dmitry Peskov.  
Most of the CTD data were collected during joint 
expeditions of SakhNIRO with the Pacific 
Oceanological Institute (POI, Vladivostok) and the 
Far-Eastern Hydrometeorological Institute (FEHRI, 
Vladivostok) during the 1990s.

and the N-5 mooring (star) in 2006–2007. 
Convection calculations were carried out according 
to Arkhipkin (1992). A spatial flow pattern in the 
western part of Sea of Okhotsk was obtained using 
the dynamics method from the “zero” surface of 
1000 db (Timofeev and Panov, 1962).  
 
Study of the currents, including the vertical 
component, was conducted using three-component 
Doppler profilers (Cabrera et al., 1987; Polonichko 
et al., 2000), which made it possible to investigate 
both the horizontal and vertical velocities of the 
flows in situ. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
Figure 2 presents a typical vertical temperature 
distribution in the western part of Sea of Okhotsk 
based on the standard horizon measurements and 
characterizing the northeastern shelf/slope of 
Sakhalin.  Two main features are apparent – the 
dichothermal layer has a united body, and temporal 
changes from summer to autumn are insignificant 
(Fig. 2).  However, during the soundings with greater 
depth resolution, frequent inversions are seen.  One 
such example is shown in the Figure 3.

If the vertical distribution has temperature inversions 
(Fig. 3), how are the inversions arranged spatially,  
for example, in the western part of Sea of Okhotsk? 
In order to understand the distribution of inversions 
inside the DTL, 1996 data have been processed from 
the joint POI-SakhNIRO expedition. For clarity and 
ease of presentation, the arrangement of inversions 
inside the DTL temperature distributions on the 
standard horizons superimposed on one another from 
top (30 m) to bottom (300 m) are shown in Figure 4. 
Such superpositioning of the different horizons 
shows regions of temperature inversions inside the 
DTL, but it is obvious, that there is no spatial 
predominance of inversions inside the layer –this is 
apparently local phenomena according the 1996 data 
analysis (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, new facts about the 
vertical distribution of temperature inversions in the 
DTL pose a new question – Why do the temperature 
inversions penetrate more deeply than calculated?  
 
Knowing the characteristics of the ice thickness in 
the western part of the Sea of Okhotsk, we know that 
theoretically convection does not penetrate deeper 
than 250–300 m. But we actually do observe the 
presence of DTL depths on the order of 500 m. How 
can we explain such measurements?  Are they 
showing a flow downward or are they the remainders 
of the past year, or year before last?  (What causes

memory”, which reflects the convection level of 
previous year?) 
 
Here, we analyze convection during the cold period 
of the year. How is it shown for the Sea of Okhotsk? 
Besides the winter type of classical convection for 
the cooling and freezing areas, the Sea of Okhotsk 
possesses convection during the summer period 
when the flow of salt with the Soya Current inside 
Sea of Okhotsk leads to the lowering of waters at its 
southwestern basin near the South Kuril Islands. 
Here, we can observe an underwater waterfall with a 
horizontal scale tens of kilometers and hundred 
meters vertically, which also makes it necessary to 
think about the reasons for vertical motions in the 
Sea of Okhotsk.  
 
A similar picture in the winter period is also observed 
on the Kamchatka shelf and slope (Kashiwai, this 
report) when more salt water from the Pacific Ocean 
causes convection, but this exceeds the scope of our 
article. Therefore, we do not discuss it further, but 
keep it in mind for future investigations. 
Current dynamics

This allows us to concentrate on the following issue. 
If we observe the DTL practically the year round in 
the western part of the Sea of Okhotsk, then 
apparently there are conditions for its retention here, 
some of which we know a little about regarding the 
vertical components of currents in this region. It is 
known that the general cyclonic circulation of the 
surface flows in the Sea of Okhotsk water mass 
distribution (Leonov, 1960; Moroshkin, 1966; 
Chernyavsky, 1981) must lead to the rise of waters in 
the central Sea of Okhotsk basin, with the 
dichothermal layer disappearing, probably 
seasonally. However, it exists in the western part Sea 
of Okhotsk all year-round.  
 
Aiming to measure the vertical component of the 
current velocities, the N-5 mooring with an ADP was 
installed at the northern tip of Sakhalin, just inside the 
zone of the beginning of the Eastern Sakhalin Current. 
At the same time, temperature was recorded at a depth 
of 100 m on the layer where the DTL should exist; 
current profiles at different horizons were also taken. 
The year-round duration of the velocities and 
temperature measurements are shown in Figure 5.  It 
can be seen that the motion of the averaged vertical 
velocity possesses an expressed seasonal signal with 
positive vertical velocities (upward) for the cold 
period of year and negative ones (downward) during 
summer and early fall period.  
 
Analyzing the layer below the seasonally heated 
upper one, we found that during observation period 
the vertical component was negative and directed 
towards the bottom without any seasonally induced 
changes in the magnitude and sign of the vertical 
velocities, except for interannual differences between 
the fall periods of 2006 and 2007, respectively 
(Fig.6). In addition, bottom temperature was negative 
all year (Fig.7). A period of about one month, 
between mid-October and mid-November 2006 had a 
signal, which indicates some reflection of weak 
warming near the bottom from subzero temperatures. 
Temperature was mainly stable between about  
–1.7° and –1.6°C for the rest of the year at this depth 
after peaking to  –0.65°C in early December (Fig.7). 
 
The year-round subzero temperatures at 100 m depth 
on the shelf strongly confirm and update previously 
obtained results (Gladyshev et al., 2000, 2003; 
Mizuta et al., 2003; Shcherbina et al., 2003). The 
shelf and slope at the northwestern part of the Sea of 
Okhotsk is defined as a permanent source of water 
with subzero temperatures supplying the DTL in the 
western part of the Sea of Okhotsk.

Meanwhile a relatively strong warming signal inside 
the DTL coincided in time with the amplification of 
the East Sakhalin Current in the fall. It is known that 
in the western, but mostly in the northwestern, part 
of the Sea of Okhotsk, the current circulation system 
is a function of the year type (Figurkin, 2000). Cold 
years are characterized by the alongshore East

Sakhalin Current which is directed to the south 
(Ohshima et al., 2002); an opposite picture should be 
obtained for the warm years when northward water 
flows mostly along the shelf and slope of Sakhalin. 
Currently, we have no measurements of the vertical 
components for the East Sakhalin Current directed to 
the north, or in the period when circulations are 
undergoing change.  
 
Figure 8 shows locations of the “double” DTL at the 
shelf and continental slope of Sakhalin which are 
found in current convergence zones or at eddy 
borders in deep waters. 
 
Comparing the dynamic topography map with the 
location of sea surface temperature fronts (Belkin 
and Cornillon, 2004), we note the agreement of belts 
of convergence with places of inversions inside the 
DTL, both in the deepest basin of the southwestern 
Sea of Okhotsk and in the waters around Terpeniya 
Peninsula. Examining the more generalized map of 
the Sea of Okhotsk frontal zones (Belkin and 
Cornillon, 2004), we conclude that the high 
temperature intrusions inside the DTL are generated 
at the frontal borders of water masses in the Sea of 
Okhotsk.

POI–SakhNIRO data, R/V Gagarinsky). 
Conclusions 
 
Temperature inversions inside the DTL are located in 
the convergence zone and (or) near the thermal fronts 
in the Sea of Okhotsk. In the Sea of Okhotsk at least 
two types of the convections are obtained, linked 
with the transport of salt water during the warm 
period by the Soya Current or Pacific waters, and 
connected with cooling and brine rejection under ice 
floes during the late autumn and winter.  
 
Observations at the N-5 ADP mooring from 2006–
2007 confirmed DTL waters submerging during the 
whole period of observations. The upper mixed layer 
had another type of vertical motion, switching from 
upwelling to downwelling in the cold and the warm 
period of year, respectively. These data need to be 
confirmed by other studies, including those of 
seasonal behavior of the open water levels. The 
changeability in the vertical motions of water inside 
the Sea of Okhotsk must be investigated in relation 
to its obvious influence on sea biota, especially for 
early ontogenetic stages, and to contemporary trends 
in climate oscillations and hydrography.  
 
Observed convection depths of the DTL are deeper 
in the comparison with those calculated by theory for 
the western part Sea of Okhotsk, and requires 
separate and detailed studies. It is obvious that 
organizing a series of ice-breaker expeditions is 
needed to study the formation of convections under 
the ice and in polynyas in the Sea of Okhotsk in 
winter because there are no oceanographical, 
chemical or biological data during ice formation and 
seasonal melting.

Abstract  
 
Current meter measurements from the summer of 2006 at the Kaygano-Vasyukansky (KV), Vostochno-
Shmidtovsky (VS) and Zapadno-Shmidtovsky (ZS) oil and gas-bearing blocks are analyzed.  Observations 
revealed the important role of the diurnal tidal currents, which predominated over other types of water motions 
in the area which adjoins the remote part of northern Sakhalin Island (Shmidt Peninsula).  The ellipses of main 
tidal constituents were highly compressed and changed little with depth.  Residual (non-tidal) flows in the 
intermediate and near-bottom layers had a steadier nature in comparison with the surface, in which the wind 
effect was shown.  The main flow in these layers had orientations on the KV block to the south and south-
southwest; on the VS block to the east and south-southeast; in the northern part of the ZS block to the south-
southwest and to the east; in the southern part of the ZS block to the north and northeast. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
In the summer of 2006, the Sakhalin Institute of 
Fisheries and Oceanography (SakhNIRO) carried out 
comprehensive studies on potential oil fields in the 
Sea of Okhotsk, which adjoin Shmidt Peninsula at 
the northern end of Sakhalin Island. The program 
included taking flow measurements at the water 
surface, intermediate and near-bottom layers every 
10 minutes at four autonomous stations which were 
deployed on the Kaygano-Vasyukansky (KV), 
Vostochno-Shmidtovsky (VS) and Zapadno-
Shmidtovsky (ZS) oil and gas-bearing blocks. The 
moorings positions are represented in Figure 1 and 
related parameters are given in the Table 1. 
 
Dynamic processes in the waters adjacent to Shmidt 
Peninsula represent significant interest not only for 
offshore development, but because our current 
measurements were the first full-scale experiment in 
this region. During the period from 1988 to 1997, a 
large amount of observational data were obtained in 
the oil and gas-bearing areas of the northeastern shelf 
of the island, but in the region more to the south. The 
results of these analyses have been well described 
(Popudribko et al., 1998; Putov and Shevchenko, 
1998; Kochergin et al., 1999; Krasavtsev et al., 
 
2001; Rybalko and Shevchenko, 2003; Shevchenko 
and Rybalko, 2003; Shevchenko, 2004). These 
investigations revealed the extraordinarily complex

nature of water dynamics in this region, the main 
features of which are: 
• Strong diurnal tidal currents of 2–3 knots (1–1.5 
m/s) in the coastal zone from Cape Elizabeth to 
Lunsky Bay (approximately 51°25′N);  
• Coastal upwelling due to the action of the 
southern winds during the summer season;  
• The sharp strengthening of coastal flow to the 
south in the fall period as a result of the change in 
the wind field to winter monsoon conditions, with 
characteristic winds blowing from the north and 
northwest directions, which transfer low salinity 
water caused by the Amur River run-off along the 
east coast of Sakhalin. 
 
However, only at the KV block it is possible to 
expect that these dynamic processes will have a 
similar nature, since topographical conditions in the 
region to the north of Sakhalin differ significantly 
from the northeastern shelf of the island. Currents in 
this area are especially interesting, since it was 
studied to the much smaller degree. One of a few 
works (Putov and Shevchenko, 2001) was dedicated 
to the analysis of current meter measurements in the 
shelf region near Okhotsk (the Kukhtuyskaya oil and 
gas-bearing area). Although the measurements were 
conducted at the significant distance from Shmidt 
Peninsula, let us examine some results of this work, 
since it is interesting to compare them with the 
measurements obtained in the present project. 
 
Near Okhotsk, currents were measured in the 
surface, intermediate and near-bottom layers for two 
weeks at the end of May–beginning June 1988 
(Putov and Shevchenko, 2001). Records showed that 
tidal fluctuations prevailed, and they were somewhat 
weaker in the surface layer compared to the 
intermediate layer which was influenced by water 
stratification. In the thin heated upper layer, inertial 
flows were also noted, but were practically absent at 
depths below the thermocline. 
 
Residual currents were comparatively small and 
oriented in a west–southwest direction, and their 
intensity diminished with the depth. In the middle 
layer flow was observed in a western direction, while 
in the upper layer, directions were more irregular,  
probably due to the variable action of the wind. 
 
KV Block (N-1) Mooring Results 
 
The N-1 mooring, which included the SonTek/YSI 
Acoustic Doppler Profiler (ADP), was deployed on 
July 21 near Cape Levenshtern (Fig. 1, Table 1).  It 
was in this area that coastal radar measurements of 
ice drift  were made in 1992–1995 and thus, there 
was information about the pattern of flows 
(Tambovsky and Shevchenko, 1999). The ADP was 
fixed on a special stainless steel frame which was 
held on the substrate with the aid of two anchors.  
The depth of the sea at the point of deployment was 
78 m. Current measurements were performed in 18 
layers with a thickness of 4 m each, except for a 
“blank zone” approximately about 5 m above the 
sensor heads where no measurements were taken.  
The distinctive feature of the Doppler profilers 
established on the bottom is that the measurements in 
the near-surface layer are usually contaminated by 
surface waves. We will have this in mind when we 
discuss the observations. 
 
For observations, three different layers were 
selected:  the near-bottom (1st layer from the ADP), 
intermediate (9th layer from the ADP) and upper 
(surface) layer (18th layer from the ADP). The 
measured velocity vectors of the currents are 
represented in Figure 2. The north–south meridional 
component of the currents clearly predominates for 
all the horizons. This is due to the orientation of 
coastline where the KV block is almost parallel to 
the meridian. Observations show that diurnal tidal 
currents prevail. Characteristic of them is a two-week 
changeability where there is a sharp weakening on

August 1–3 and on August 14–16. This is expressed 
especially in the intermediate and near-bottom 
layers. At the surface, due to an increase in the role 
of winds, the contribution of the residual component 
generally grows with the intensity of total flows. It is 
possible that, to a certain extent, the high speed of 
the residual component and the less regular nature of 
the tidal currents are caused by the distorting 
influence of the free surface, which was discussed 
above. 
 
Let us examine the results of the calculated 
distributions of current velocities at different 
horizons (Fig. 2). In the surface layer, the highest 
repetition (34.4%) is obtained in the northern 
direction where maximum speeds (more than 180 
cm/s) are prevalent.  The repetition of the flows of 
the southern direction is somewhat less (21.8%), 
while maximum speeds are also high (180.9 cm/s); in 
this direction, the average speed is the highest 
(75.4 cm/s). In the middle layer the situation is quite 
different—here the currents are predominantly in the 
southern direction—their repetition is the highest 
(42.5%); in this direction speeds attain maximum 
values (134.7 cm/s), and greatest average values 
(63.7). The near-bottom layer is also characterized 
by a separation of currents to the southern direction 
(30.9%), but the greatest repetition in the flows is in 
the northwestern direction (37.4%).  Here, we note 
an increase in the portion of the currents in the 
southeastern direction (14.6%). This indicates that in 
the near-bottom layer, the currents flow 
counterclockwise in comparison with the upper 
layers. The maximum speeds are in the southern 
(100.3 cm/s), southeastern (95.6 cm/s) and north-
western directions (76.4 cm/s), which are 
substantially less than in the intermediate and surface 
layers.  The average speeds are 40, 39 and 35 cm/s, 
respectively. 
 
According to the observational data at each station, 
the velocity vectors of the currents on the parallel 
and on the meridian are usually determined from 
harmonic constant amplitudes and phases of 8 basic 
tidal constituents:  4 diurnal (Q
1
, O
1
, P
1
, K
1
) and 4 
semidiurnal (N
2
, M
2
, S
2
, K
2
). At the N-1 mooring, in 
addition to the very fast diurnal tidal currents, two 
additional diurnal waves (2Q
1
, HI
1
) were determined. 
For other points in this area, measurements are 
negligibly small. Tidal currents are traditionally 
characterized by ellipses, which are designed on the 
basis of the calculated harmonic constants. Figure 3 
shows the current ellipses for the two main tidal 
constituents:  diurnal K
1
 and semidiurnal M
2
. 
 
Starting from the origin in each panel in Figure 3, the 
current vector arising from each constituent traces 
out an ellipse over that constituent’s period. The 
rhombs on each ellipse denote the end positions of 
the vector at each successive hour for the diurnal 
constituent and half-hour for the semidiurnal waves. 
In the surface layer the ellipses of diurnal tidal 
constituent are compressed and have a bi-meridian 
orientation.  The ellipse of the semidiurnal 
constituent is less compressed, major semi-axes

are oriented along the axis southeast–northwest. In 
the middle layer the ellipse of the diurnal harmonics 
is somewhat turned clockwise, their major semi-axes 
somewhat more than in the surface layer. The 
ellipses of semidiurnal currents are highly 
compressed, their major semi-axes are greater than in 
the surface layer, and they are elongated along the 
meridian. 
 
This difference in the characteristics of tidal currents 
at different depths can be related to the influence of 
baroclinic effects in the thoroughly heated upper 
layer (Putov and Shevchenko, 2001), and is more 
applicable to the semidiurnal constituent whose 
period is lower than the Coriolis period in this 
region. In the near-bottom layer the ellipses of all 
waves are highly compressed, their major semi-axes 
decrease in comparison to the intermediate layer and 
are turned clockwise. Such changes are typical when 
ground friction plays a role, and they agree well with 
the results for the Piltun–Astokhskaya area, northeast 
Sakhalin (Popudribko et al., 1998). The obtained 
estimations of major tidal constituent make it 
possible to estimate different characteristics of tidal 
currents, in particular, the maximum speeds, based 
on astronomical conditions. 
  
Current dynamics 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  117 
It is well known that for this region to account for the 
inter-annual fluctuations of tide ranges, it is 
necessary to consider variations with the period of 
18.6 years (usually rounded off to 19 years) (Putov 
and Shevchenko, 1998). To adequately describe the 
distribution of tidal components, it is necessary to 
construct distributions in the gradations of speed and 
the directions, pre-calculated for the 19-year period. 
In the surface layer intensive fluctuations with 
periods of 1–2 weeks were observed, which is typical 
for currents caused by the action of wind. Variations 
in the meridional component were especially great; 
their amplitude reached 80 cm/s, which is 
uncharacteristic for the summer period, when 
synoptic processes are expressed relatively weakly 
(Kochergin et al., 1999). In the middle and near-
bottom layers the speeds of residual currents 
noticeably decrease, the meridional components have 
a similar nature, and the zonal components are 
distinguished more substantially. The distribution of 
the residual flows in the gradations of speed and the 
directions (Fig. 4) reflect these changes. Thus, in the 
intermediate layer, the main flow is oriented south–
southeast (repetition 48.6 and 21.1%, respectively); 
in the near-bottom layer the greatest repetition is in 
the southern (27.4%) and southwestern directions 
(20.1%), followed by increases in the western 
(13.5%) and northwestern (15.1%) directions. 
 
Similar differences were found in the Piltun–
Astokhskaya area (Krasavtsev et al., 2000; 
Shevchenko, 2004) where an increase in the near-
bottom layer of the repetition of flows oriented along 
the coast was connected to coastal upwelling, which 
occurs on the northeastern shelf of Sakhalin due to 
the action of the winds from the south, and 
characterized the summer season.

VS Block (N-2) Mooring Results  
 
Let us examine the current measurements obtained 
on the VS block collected by the N-2 mooring. At 
this mooring, three single-point current meters, 
SonTek Argonaut-MD, were fixed at horizons of 8, 
49 and 94 m. The mooring depth reached 97 m 
(Fig. 1, Table 1). The vertical tension of the rope was 
ensured by plastic subsurface buoys, and the mooring 
was fixed on the bottom by two anchors.  
 
The velocity vectors of the currents at different 
horizons are presented in Figure 5. Similar to the KV 
block, diurnal tidal currents prevailed; however, they 
differed from the KV block in that their intensity was 
considerably less and there were no essential 
differences between meridional and zonal 
components, although the speed of meridian currents 
were slightly higher, especially in the upper two 
layers. 
 
Distributions of speed and direction show that in the 
surface layer, the highest repetition (16–17%) was 
less for the southern and southeastern directions, and 
for the northern and northwestern directions. 
Meanwhile, the highest average speed (30–33 cm/s), 
with a maximum value (65 cm/s) was noted in the 
southeastern direction.  With depth there was an 
increase in the proportion of southeastern and north-
western flow directions (particularly in the near-
bottom layer, where the repetition of southeastern 
direction increased to 31.2%). Differences in the 
distributions in the surface and middle layers were 
insignificant.  
 
The harmonic constants of 8 major tidal constituents, 
defined in the same way as for the N-1 mooring, 
were used for constructing the tidal ellipses for the 
main diurnal and semidiurnal constituents 
represented in Figure 6. The harmonic constants of 
the main diurnal constituents are very similar at 
different horizons. There is only an insignificant 
reduction in the amplitude of meridian with an 
analogous increase in the amplitude of the zonal 
component, which indicates a certain turn of ellipses 
in the cyclonic direction with the depth. The vector 
direction in the tidal cycle was clockwise for both 
constituents (except for M
2
 at 49 m depth). Vertical 
changes in the ellipses of semidiurnal harmonics are 
more apparent. Compared to the surface, the middle 
layer has compressed ellipses with a decrease of the 
major semi-axis. The direction of rotation of the 
vectors in the tidal cycle changes to the cyclonic. In 
the near-bottom layer ellipses are even more 
compressed; in this case, they turn significantly, and 
have an almost zonal orientation. The observed 
differences in the orientation of the axes of diurnal 
and semidiurnal constituents, even in spite of smaller 
velocity of the latter, are the reasons for the fairly 
complicated picture of the distributions of tidal 
currents in the gradations of speed and the directions. 
 
First of all, in the surface layer the northern (21.9%) 
and southern (20.3%) directions are separated; in the 
intermediate layer this is also southern (23.5%) and 
northwestern (26.9%). In the near-bottom layer these 
are already southeastern (28.9%) and northwestern 
(25.5%) directions. Non-tidal currents at the VS 
block were comparatively small, with fluctuations of 
periods 1–2 weeks. High-frequency variations

occurred, which are characteristic of regions with 
developed turbulence. The pattern of residual flows 
in the surface and intermediate layers was identical, 
in the near-bottom layer the rate of flows were 
noticeably lessened. Moreover, variations in the 
synoptic time range were manifested more distinctly. 
 
The distributions of residual flows in the gradations 
of speed and the directions (Fig. 7) reveals a 
predominance in the surface layer of the flows of 
northern (15%), northeastern (16.3%) and eastern 
(16.3%) directions. In the middle layer, the eastern 
direction (18%) is separated more clearly from the 
northeastern and southeastern directions which are 
similar (about 15%). In the near-bottom layer there is 
a noticeable turn in the main flow, with the greatest 
share of repetition in the southern (34%) and 
southeastern (33.5%) directions. The difference 
between the surface and near-bottom layers is most 
likely due to the influence of the winds from the 
south predominating during the summer season. On 
the surface, therefore, a large proportion is in the 
northern direction, which is analogous to that already 
noted above for the KV block. In this case, a 
compensating current in the opposite direction 
appears on the bottom layer.

ZS Block Mooring Results 
 
Northern (N-3) observations  
 
Here, the N-3 mooring, with the same design as N-2, 
was deployed. The single-point current meters 
registered currents at 8, 62 and 127 m horizons. 
Although the depth on this block is the greatest 
(130 m) compared to the others, the currents are the 
smallest. In contrast to cases described above, the 
zonal component of the currents predominate 
(Fig. 8), especially in the near-bottom layer. Flow 
patterns in the gradations of speed and the directions 
were calculated.  In the subsurface layer the highest 
repetition corresponds to the western (20%), eastern 
(19.2%) and southeastern directions (16.4%), and 
maximum speeds are in the western and 
southwestern directions (about 66 cm/s). The average 
speeds are approximately the same with respect to all 
directions. In the intermediate layer the repetition of 
western and southeastern currents increases 
somewhat (22.8% and 24.2%, respectively) with a 
decreasing share in eastern direction (14.1%), but as 
a whole the nature of distribution does not change. 
The maximum values of speed also coincide with the 
western direction, but they decrease more than two 
times (30.8 cm/s). In the near-bottom layer a change 
in the nature of distribution is more apparent.  Here, 
the currents in the eastern direction clearly 
predominate (45.7%), and the share in the western 
direction sharply decrease (3.5%). The maximum 
and average values of speed are approximately the 
same as in the middle layer, with exception of the 
eastern directions, where they increase somewhat.

Fig. 8 Meridional (N) and zonal (E) velocity components 
(cm/s) at depths 8, 62 and 127 m obtained at mooring N-3 
ZS block (July 21–August 26, 2006). 
 
Amplitudes and phases of the main tidal constituents 
were calculated for each horizon, and the ellipses of 
the main diurnal and semidiurnal constituents are 
represented in Figure 9. It is most interesting that at 
127 m depth the amplitude of the diurnal harmonics 
increases somewhat in comparison with two upper 
layers (an analogous phenomenon was observed in 
the region of Okhotsk port (Sea of Okhotsk 
northwestern shelf) (Putov and Shevchenko, 2001). 
Current speeds for the main diurnal and semidiurnal 
components are approximately the same; in the 
surface and middle layers the ellipses are compressed 
and oriented along the axis east–west and northwest 
directions; and the rotation of vectors in the tidal 
 
cycle is counter-clockwise.  In the near-bottom layer 
the ellipses are oriented almost along-latitude, the 
compression ratio somewhat decreases, and the 
direction of rotation remains counterclockwise.  For 
the semidiurnal components, in particular S
2
, an 
increase in speed and a decreasing compression ratio 
of ellipses in the near-bottom layer is also 
characteristic (not shown). 
 
The intensity of non-tidal flows in the northern part 
of the ZS block is comparatively small. Against the 
background flows at all horizons, variations with 
periods of approximately 1 week are expressed more 
weakly than on the VS block. A notable 
strengthening of the flows in the southeastern 
direction was observed on August 14–16, especially 
in the middle layer. The most interesting moment 
was at the end of the observational period when there 
was a sharp intensification in currents at the surface 
layer. These currents had a quasi-periodic nature, 
with a period of approximately 14 hours, which is 
close to the Coriolis period for deployment at that 
latitude. This indicates that the inertial flows were 
the most probable reason for the observed current 
intensification, with amplitudes reaching 40–45 
cm/s. An analogous manifestation of this form of 
periodic flow, also in the thoroughly heated upper 
layer, was noted in the region near the port of 
Okhotsk (Putov and Shevchenko, 2001). Generally, 
the formation of these flows is connected with 
strengthening of the wind, which was noted during 
weather observations taken onboard the R/V Dmitry 
Peskov. At 62 m depth only weak transmissions of 
these currents are examined, which, as a rule, are 
most intensive near the thermocline. According to 
the results of our CTD survey, the thermocline was 
located at a depth of approximately 20 m, and at 
depths more than 30 m in this region uniformly cold 
waters (–1.4ºC) with the sufficiently high salinity 
(33 psu) were observed.  
 
The flow pattern in the gradations of the speed and 
the directions (Fig. 10) in the surface layer reveal 
approximately the same values of repetition in 
different directions. Flows in the southern (16.7%) 
and southwestern (17%) directions are weak and 
separated. In the middle layer, these directions share 
approximately the same increase (21.2% and 21.4%); 
in the near-bottom layer the current is well expressed 
to the east (44.3%).

Southern (N-4) observations  
 
Mooring N-4 was deployed at a depth of 45 m 
(Fig. 1, Table 1), and currents measurements were 
conducted with an ADP in which the water column 
was divided into the 21 sublayers of 2 m thickness. 
Deployment conditions were the same as for the N-1 
mooring. For observations, the following layers were 
chosen – the near-bottom (1st layer from the ADP), 
intermediate (11th layer from the ADP) and surface 
(21st layer from the ADP). North and east 
projections are shown in Figure 11. 
 
The role of tides was approximately the same in the 
N-2 and the N-4 mooring data (in contrast with N-1 
and N-3 mooring data). Diurnal tidal currents 
prevailed, especially in the intermediate and near-
bottom layers. To a lesser degree this was 
characteristic for the surface layer, where the relative 
role of non-tidal flows is more significant.  
 
The ellipses of the main diurnal harmonic K
1
 
(Fig. 12) at the surface and intermediate layers are 
almost identical – they are compressed, elongated 
along the east–west and south–west axis, and the 
rotation of vectors in the cycle is clockwise. In the 
near-bottom layer diurnal flows have a clear 
reversible nature; their intensity noticeably decreases 
in comparison with the upper layers. For the O
1
 
constituent (not shown) the change in rotation is 
counterclockwise. The ellipses of the main 
semidiurnal constituent, M
2
, are also very similar at 
the surface and middle layers, with compressed and 
elongated axes in the northeast–southwest direction. 
In the near-bottom layer, in contrast to the diurnal 
flows, the compression ratio of the ellipses 
decreases, and the direction of vector rotation in all 
layers is anticyclonic. The contribution to the 
formation of the tidal currents by another 
semidiurnal wave, S
2
, is insignificant and is not 
shown.

components (cm/s) at depths 2, 22 and 42 m obtained at 
mooring N-4, ZS block (July 21–August 26, 2006). 
 
Non-tidal flows, similar to other moorings, reveal 
variations in the synoptic range of periods and high-
frequency noise. Their intensity decreases 
substantially with the depth, with average speeds in 
the surface layer of about 15 cm/s, in the 
intermediate layer of approximately 10 cm/s, and in 
the near-bottom layer of approximately 8 cm/s. The 
distributions of residual currents in the gradations of 
speed and direction (Fig. 13) reveal the 
predominance of flows in the northeastern direction 
in the upper layer (34.1%). With increasing depth, 
the flow turns to the north.  In the middle layer the 
portion of northern and northeastern flows is 
approximately the same (23.7% and 25.2%), and in 
the near-bottom layer, the flow to the north clearly 
predominates (31.7%). It is probable that the 
significant role of the northern component in the 
distribution of non-tidal currents at the N-4 mooring 
is connected with the influence of Amur River runoff 
whose waters, according to the existing knowledge, 
move as a relatively narrow coastal flow mixing with 
Sea of Okhotsk waters, and go around the northern 
part of Sakhalin Island (Shmidt Peninsula). 
 
Conclusions 
 
From current measurements taken in the region 
adjacent to Shmidt Peninsula, the following 
conclusions can be drawn.  
 
First, it should be noted that a sufficient amount of 
high quality data were obtained. This is confirmed by 
a good agreement in tidal current characteristics at 
different horizons at each mooring, and are typical 
according to changes with depth (in particular for the 
sub-inertia diurnal waves, which are to a lesser 
degree subjected to baroclinic effects).  
 
Currents on the KV block are different from those 
located to the north in parameters of higher dynamics. 
Diurnal tidal currents reach 1 m/s and have 
characteristics typical at other oil and gas sites of the 
northeastern shelf of Sakhalin. Non-tidal currents 
reach 80 cm/s in the surface layer, which exceeds the 
maximum speeds according to long-term observations 
in this region in the summer period. The repetition of 
the flows of southern direction in the middle layer is 
higher here than over the Piltun–Astokhskaya area for 
the same season. In the near-bottom layer, the flow is 
directed to the coast, which should be coordinated 
with the observations carried out previously.  
 
Diurnal tidal constituents, in spite of their noticeable 
decrease in comparison with the KV block and at other 
moorings locations, determine the major role in the 
formation of currents to the north of Sakhalin. Their 
influence decreases in proportion to their removal from 
the coast, and at the deep mooring station at N-3 (ZS 
block), they are less than semidiurnal currents. In the 
upper layer at this mooring, intensive quasi-periodic 
fluctuations (amplitude of approximately 40 cm/s) are 
also noted.  
 
The oscillatory period is close to the Coriolis period 
for the measurement sites, which is probably due to 
the inertial flows. Residual flows, which are caused 
by the action of variable wind fields, are very 
intensive in the surface layer. In the lower layers the 
flow is more consolidated and has a direction 
predominantly to the southeast in the intermediate 
layer and south-southeast in the near-bottom layer at 
the VS block.

Fig. 13 Distribution of residual currents (%) by speed (cm/s) and direction gradations in (a) surface, (b) middle and  
(c) near-bottom layers at Mooring N-4. 
 
 
On the ZS block at mooring N-3, the currents in the 
southern and southwestern directions are separated in 
the middle layer, and are oriented to the east in the 
near-bottom layer. In the southern part of the ZS 
block (coastal mooring N-4), the currents are 
oriented to the northeast direction in the intermediate 
layer and to the north in the near-bottom layer.  
 
The current measurements carried out have made it 
possible for the first time to collect data on ocean 
dynamics in the area adjacent to the northern part of 
Sakhalin, in the place where East Sakhalin Current 
originates.   
 
There is an additional important practical 
significance for obtaining these results: for 
continuing offshore oil and gas development, they 
will be required for evaluating the possible loads on 
the offshore constructions and for assessing the most 
probable direction of propagation of pollutants, 
which are dangerous for marine and human life.

Abstract 
 
Our knowledge of dynamic processes in the area adjacent to the South Kuril Islands is very limited because of 
a lack of current mooring observations.  The information related to currents in this region was obtained from 
satellite-tracked drifters (Rabinovich and Thomson, 2001; Ohshima et al., 2005).  To investigate currents in 
this region, the Sakhalin Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography installed two moorings in the shelf 
waters of Urup and Kunashir islands in 2003.  Experimental studies of dynamic processes were conducted 
from 2004–2005 in the areas adjacent to Kunashir Island. Diurnal tidal currents strongly dominate on the 
northern shelf of Urup Island, especially the east-directed component.  Tidal currents are almost rectilinear and 
very steady.  Stable east-directed residual currents with an average velocity of 10–12 cm/s were found from 
April until September which means that there was an outflow of Okhotsk Sea water to the Pacific Ocean 
through Urup Strait during this period.  We found significant amplification of the current in October and 
November, with the current direction becoming northeast.  Autumn typically is a time of atmospheric fields 
changing to the so-called winter monsoon, with its strong northwesterly winds; however, we did not find this 
changing in the fall of 2003, from reanalysis data. Another cause of current amplification probably followed, 
besides the baroclinic effect.  However, the noted phenomena are still unclear because there were no salinity 
sensors at the moorings.  A temperature maximum (8–9°C) was found in the second half of October (about two 
times greater than in August). A similar current amplification was observed near Ekaterina Strait in 
September–October. We also found tides weakening at this time. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Our knowledge of dynamic processes in the area 
adjacent to the South Kuril Islands is very limited 
because of the scarcity of current mooring 
observations. Direct current measurements have been 
carried out in Ekaterina and Freez straits (Luchin, 
1996; Fux, 1997) but they were relatively short 
period observations (two or three weeks) which were 
focused on the study of tidal currents. Very strong 
tidal currents which cause mixing of the Ohkotsk Sea 
and Pacific Ocean waters were found in the straits. 
The same information related to currents in this 
region was also obtained from satellite-tracked 
drifters (Thomson et al., 1997; Rabinovich, 
Thomson, 2001; Ohshima et al., 2005). Strong 
diurnal tidal motions were found on the shelf waters 
of Urup and Iturup islands. Low-frequency eddy-
induced drifter oscillations were observed in the area 
of the Kuril Trench.  
 
To investigate currents in this region, the Sakhalin 
Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography 
installed two moorings on the Okhotsk Sea shelf of 
Urup and Kunashir islands in 2003. Experimental 
studies of dynamic processes were conducted from 
2004–2005 in the areas adjacent to Kunashir Island. 
Mooring current measurements were mainly directed 
to the study of seasonal changes in circulation.  
 
Observations 
 
The first mooring “Leya-1” was installed on the shelf 
of Urup Island on February 28, 2003, at coordinates 
46°28′ N and 150°09′ E (Table 1, Fig.1). Total depth 
in this spot equaled 110 m and a current meter, 
SonTek Argonaut MD, was fastened at a depth of 
30 m. The current meter included a water 
temperature sensor. The mooring was lifted on board 
the R/V Dmitry Peskov on November 19, 2003. The 
period of observations amounted to 265 days.

PICES Scientific Report No. 36  129 
The second mooring “Leya-2” was installed on the 
shelf of Kunashir Island on June 10, 2003, at 
coordinates 44º39′ N 146º26′ E, close to Ekaterina 
Strait.  Total depth in this spot equaled 126 m and an 
acoustic Doppler current profiler, SonTek ADP, was 
placed on the sea bottom housed in a special stainless 
frame. The ADP measured currents in 15 layers with 
each layer 8 m thick.  The mooring was lifted onto 
the R/V Dmitry Peskov on October 16, 2003.  The 
period of observations amounted to 127 days.  
 
The experimental study of currents was continued on 
August 2, 2004. The mooring “Leya-3”, with the 
same equipment used for Leya 2, was installed a 
small distance east of Leya-2 (Table 1). The depth 
was 130 m, and the ADP measured current velocities 
in 15 layers of thickness 8 m each. Unfortunately, 
one block of ADP memory was damaged which 
resulted in significant data gaps from August 2 to 
December 10. Because of the gaps, we did not use 
these data for analysis. The mooring was lifted onto 
the R/V Dmitry Peskov on June 30, 2005.   
Almost simultaneous to the deployment of Leya 2, 
current mooring measurements were carried out on 
the Pacific side of Ekaterina Strait (Fig.1, Table 1). 
The mooring “Olga” was installed on August 3, 2004 
(current measurements started at 0:00 Sakhalin 
summer time, August 4). A three-dimensional 
acoustic current meter, SonTek Argonaut, was used. 
Total depth was 210 m, and the depth of the current 
meter was about 45 m. The mooring was fixed by a 
200-kg ballast, and an acoustic breaker,  Edge Tech, 
was fastened 3 m above it. The length of the halyard 
was 160 m, and the vertical tension of the halyard 
was provided by several silumin buoys which were 
fastened above the current meter. The number of 
buoys was insufficient to hold the current meter in 
place, so the depth of the current meter was changed 
under the influence of the currents (mainly tidal 
currents). This effect was noted from the hydrostatic 
pressure data (Argonaut was fitted with water 
temperature and pressure sensors).  The mooring was 
lifted onto the R/V Dmitry Peskov on July 3, 2005.

About one and half months earlier, on May 14, 2005, 
the mooring “Shalila” was installed near Tanfilieva 
Island (Fig. 1, Table 1).  A three-dimensional 
acoustic current meter, SonTek Argonaut, was placed 
in a crab trap which was set on the sea bottom. Total 
depth was about 27 m, and currents were measured at  
25 m depth. The Argonaut was also fitted with water 
temperature and pressure sensors. The mooring was 
lifted onto the R/V Dmitry Peskov on October 29, 
2005. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
East- and north-directed current components, which 
were measured on the shelf waters of Urup Island, 
are shown in Figure 2. Diurnal tidal currents strongly 
dominate, especially the east-directed component. 
Tidal currents are almost rectilinear and very steady. 
A well-expressed fortnightly modulation of tides was 
found, which is typical for areas with predominantly 
diurnal waves. The amplitude of the main diurnal 
constituent K
1
 measured 17 cm/s, and the main 
semidiurnal M
2
 constituent measured 10 cm/s.  
 
Ten-day mean vectors of residual currents (tides 
were predicted and subtracted) on the shelf of Urup 
Island and wind vectors (reanalysis data) are shown 
in Figure 3. We found a stable east-directed residual 
current with an average velocity of 10–12 cm/s from 
April until September which means that there was an 
outflow of Okhotsk Sea water to the Pacific 
 
Ocean through Urup Strait during this period. We 
found significant amplification of the current in 
October and November, with the current direction 
becoming northeast.

Current dynamics 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  131 
Autumn typically is a time of atmospheric fields 
changing to the so-called winter monsoon, with its 
strong northwesterly winds; however, we did not find 
this changing in the fall of 2003. Another cause of 
current amplification may have been due to changes 
in water temperature and salinity. The current meter 
had a temperature sensor but no salinity sensor, so 
we could not study salinity changes. It is very 
interesting that a temperature maximum (8–9°C) was 
found in the second half of October, which was about 
two times greater than in August (Fig. 4). This late 
temperature increase is probably connected with 
current amplification.  
 
East and north-directed current components on the 
shelf of Kunashir Island (Leya-2 mooring) are shown 
in Figure 5. Diurnal tidal currents strongly dominate, 
especially in the north-directed component. Tidal 
currents are almost rectilinear and steady until 
September. A well-expressed fortnightly modulation 
of tides was found from June to August. The 
amplitude of the main diurnal constituent K
1
 
measured 25 cm/s, and that of the main semidiurnal 
constituent M
2
 was 12 cm/s. 
 
Five-day mean current vectors in the middle and 
near-bottom layers in the area adjacent to Ekaterina 
Strait (Leya-2) are shown in Figure 6. Southeasterly 
currents (which correspond to the outflow to the 
Pacific Ocean), with an average velocity of 10–15 
cm/s were from June until mid-September. 
Significant current amplification and counter-
clockwise vector turning were observed in the fall 
season. A northeasterly current was found in the 
middle layer and a northerly current in the near-
bottom layer. The amplification was similar to that 
on the Urup shelf. 
 
A strong northeasterly current was observed from 
January to mid-February 2005 (Leya-3 mooring, see 
Fig. 7). From the middle of February, an outflow to 
the Pacific Ocean was observed, especially in the 
middle layer.

Conclusions 
 
• Long-term observations of currents near the South 
Kuril Islands revealed strong diurnal tidal 
currents, which significantly dominate all other 
types of motions in this region;  
• Amplification of northeasterly currents on the 
Okhotsk Sea shelf of the South Kuril Islands was 
found in October–January. This amplification is 
probably induced by a baroclinic gradient ;  
• Outflow through Urup Strait to the Pacific Ocean 
was observed from March until September;  
• The outflow through Ekaterina Strait to the 
Pacific Ocean was observed from February to 
mid-September, especially in the middle layer;  
• Small residual currents were found near 
Tanfilieva Island.

Abstract  
 
A unified satellite altimetry database, TOPEX/Poseidon (1993–2002) and Jason-1 (2002–2007) containing 
about 7,000 locations, was created for the Okhotsk Sea and adjacent areas.  Amplitudes and phases of main 
tidal consituents were calculated for each location, and maps of tidal character and height were constructed.  It 
is shown that diurnal waves dominate in the amphidromic areas of semidiurnal waves in Sakhalinsky Bay, near 
the Yamskie Islands, and the eastern Sakhalin coastline.  Tidal energy increases along the axis southwest–
northeast and reaches maximal values in Shelikhov Bay.  Root mean square amplitudes of residual time series 
were taken to represent non-tidal sea level variations.  Areas with the highest values were considered to be 
energetic ocean zones. They have been found near the southeastern Kamchatka coast and on the Pacific shelf 
side of Hokkaido where mesoscale eddies are often observed.  To a lesser extent they relate to the whole Kuril-
Kamchatka deep trench (especially to its outside edge), as well as to the western Hokkaido shelf and northern 
Okhotsk Sea shelf where seasonal changes in currents are significant.  A map showing the relative portion of 
tides and residual variations in total sea level energy has been constructed. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Satellite altimetry sea level data are used to study 
dynamic processes, such as tidal motions, seasonal 
sea level circulation changes and meso-scale eddy 
formations in different parts of World Ocean. Areas 
of high intensity sea level variations are interesting 
for many scientific and practical reasons. The 
Okhotsk Sea (OS) is one of these areas because of its 
very strong tides and non-tidal sea level variations. 
Satellite altimetry data give us very important 
information related to the dynamic processes in this 
area, especially in light of the small number of 
coastal tide gauges relative to the large area of the 
OS.    
 
To determine areas with high intensity sea level 
variation (so-called energetic ocean zones) on the 
continental shelf and in the marginal seas is difficult 
because the Global Ocean Tide (GOT) model (Ray, 
1999) is not exact enough to determine shallow water 
zones. To solve this problem, a special modification 
of the least squares method to determine tidal 
amplitudes and phases in each location of a sub-
satellite track was developed (Shevchenko and 
Romanov, 2004). This method is similar to the 
algorithm used by Cherniawsky et al. (2001). In this 
way, we estimated the average amplitude of tidal and 
residual (non-tidal) sea level variations as an index of 
energy zones in the OS and its adjacent areas.  
 
Data and Methods 
 
TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 satellite altimetry data 
were used as initial sea level data. These data were 
obtained from the NASA Physical Oceanography 
Distributed Active Archive Center at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of 
Technology.  
 
For sea level calculation relative to a reference 
ellipsoid (the first-order definition of the non-
spherical shape of the Earth as an ellipsoid of 
revolution with equatorial radius of 6378.1363 km 
and a flattening coefficient of 1/298.257) by satellite 
altimeter data, the following equation was applied:

All necessary corrections to the altimetry signal 
(except tidal GOT model corrections) were taken from 
a TOPEX/Poseidon MGDR-B dataset and were 
considered according to recommendations in Benada 
(2003).  The standard technique described in Benada 
(2003) was used to obtain the reliability of altimetry 
data. A previously created (Shevchenko and 
Romanov, 2004, 2006) TOPEX/Poseidon sea level 
database (1993–2002) for the Okhotsk Sea and 
adjacent areas (northern Japan Sea, northwestern part 
of Pacific Ocean) was further developed using data of 
the Jason-1 satellite (2003–2007) which has the same 
orbits as TOPEX/Poseidon, and in a space 8 degrees 
southward. The total number of locations was about 
7,000. The length of data sets varied significantly in 
different parts of the OS. Some gaps were due to ice 
cover, especially in the northwestern OS.  For the area 
adjacent to Shantary Islands, the data sets were too 
short for the exact determination of tidal amplitudes 
and phases. Because of this problem, we did not 
analyse the sea level variations in this area.     
 
Calculations of tidal amplitudes and phases were 
carried out for each location using the authors’ 
method. The root mean square amplitude of the 
residual series (Ar) was used to estimate the quality 
of the database. The exact attachment of Jason-1 data 
demanded additional mean sea level correction.  
Without this correction, the amplitude of the residual 
oscillations would have an unrealistically large 
value. By including the correction, Ar values were 
not more than 20 cm, and in the main part of the 
study area, not more than 10 cm.  Usually residual 
variations on coastal tide gauges have a similar 
amplitude. We consider areas with high amplitude as 
energy production zones.

which indicates zones where diurnal (R > 2) and

distributions of L, R and Ar were constructed for the 
OS and adjacent areas.  
 
Results and Discussion 
 
The spatial distribution of the average tidal 
amplitude L is shown in Figure 1. This index 
increases from 25–30 cm in the southwestern part of 
the OS to 150 cm in the northeastern part. Maximal 
values (more than 200 cm) were found in Shelikhov 
Bay, in the northeastern part of the OS. In the 1980s, 
there was a plan to construct a tidal power station in 
this area (Bernstein, 1987). Some effects of the 
proposed station’s dam on tidal amplitudes and 
phases were analysed by Nekrasov and Romanenkov 
(2003). They found that high tidal amplitudes 
occurred on the northern OS shelf, on the western 
shelf of Kamchatka peninsula, and in the northern 
part of Tatar Strait (Northern Japan Sea). Small 
amplitudes were detected in the central Japan Sea, in 
the southwestern OS and in the deep Pacific Ocean 
far from the Kuril Islands. 
 
The spatial distribution of index R (Fig. 2) indicates a 
dominant role of diurnal tides in the OS that is in good 
agreement with the results of numerical simulations 
(Kowalik and Polyakov, 1998; Nekrasov and 
Romanenkov, 2003). We found areas with R values 
less than 1 near the northern OS coastline and in the 
part of the Pacific Ocean which is adjacent to Japan. 
As mentioned above, we did not analyse sea level 
variations in the area adjacent to the Shantary Islands 
where semidiurnal tides strongly predominate. R is 
high (greater than 2) in the middle part of the OS and 
on the northern and northeastern shelves of Sakhalin 
Island, especially in amphidromic areas in 
Sakhalinsky Bay and near the eastern Sakhalin coast. 
The same results were obtained for the semidiurnal 
tidal amphidrome near the Yamskie Islands. The 
presence of these amphidromes was first detected by 
Ogura (1933) as a result of coastal tide gauge data 
analysis, and is also verified by numerical modeling. 
An exception occurred for the east coast of Sakhalin, 
where an amphidrome was not identified by results of 
calculations at all (Kowalik and Polyakov, 1998).  
This amphidrome has an unusually large size due to 
it’s instability (Shevchenko and Romanov, 2004), and 
R reaches its highest values (greater than 10) here.

The spatial distribution of the root mean square 
amplitude of residual sea level variations is shown in 
Figure 3. The Kuril–Kamchatka deep trench, 
especially in the areas adjacent to Hokkaido–South 
Kuril Islands and southeastern Kamchatka–North 
Kuril Islands, are energetic ocean zones. Both these 
areas are known as areas of intensive meso-scale 
eddy formation (Bulatov and Lobanov, 1983; 
Darnitsky and Bulatov, 2005). Another area with 
high Ar values is found in the deep trench (especially 
to its outside edge) near the middle part of the Kuril 
Ridge.  
 
We found a zone of intensive eddy formation in the 
deep Kuril Basin in the southern part of the OS. High 
values of Ar are the result of strong seasonal sea 
level changes with a maximum in the wintertime and 
a significant negative surge in the fall (Romanov et 
al., 2004).  This negative surge is produced by strong 
and stable northerly and northwesterly winds which 
are typical for autumn (so-called “winter monsoon”). 
The winter maximum corresponds to winter 
amplification of the Yamskoe and North Okhotsk 
Currents. Seasonal sea level changes in the area of the 
East Sakhalin Current are weaker in comparison to the 
northern OS shelf, so the eastern shelf of Sakhalin 
Island is not an area of high Ar values, in contrast to 
Sakhalinsky Bay and Amursky Liman.  High seasonal 
sea level changes in these latter areas are induced by 
Amur River runoff.  We also found some influence of 
Amur River runoff in the northern part of Tatar Strait, 
especially in the area adjacent to the mainland 
coastline. The area of the Tsushima Warm Current is 
also a region of high Ar amplitude.  This effect is 
brought about by strong seasonal changes in the 
Current, which is weak in the wintertime and reaches 
maximal intensity in summer.  In the central part of 
the OS, on the shelf of the Kuril Islands and in the 
area adjacent to western Kamchatka coast, Ar values 
are small, less than 10 cm.

Figure 4 shows the spatial distribution of residual 
oscillation rates in total sea level variance (energy) in 
the study area. This rate is small (about 10–15%) in 
the northern, eastern, and especially the northwestern 
part of the OS because of very high tidal amplitudes. 
As stated above, the mean amplitude of residual 
oscillations is relatively high on the northern OS 
shelf. However, it is small in comparison with the 
tidal amplitude.  
 
The influence of residual oscillations increases in 
southwestern part of the OS, especially in the deep 
Kuril Basin, shallow Terpenia Bay and La Perouse 
Strait. In the Japan Sea, the rate of residual 
oscillations increases from the northern part of Tatar 
Strait to the western Hokkaido and northwestern 
Honshu shelves where it reaches 50–60% of total sea 
level variance. Similar values were found in the deep 
ocean area adjacent to Kuril Islands. The dominant 
role of residual oscillations is caused by both the 
decrease in tidal amplitude and the influence of 
Tsushima and Kuroshio currents seasonal changes 
and their meander formations.

Conclusions 
 
Using a unified satellite altimetry database, 
TOPEX/Poseidon (1993–2002) and Jason-1 (2002–
2007), spatial distributions of root mean square tidal 
and residual amplitudes were constructed for the OS 
and adjacent areas.  
 
Diurnal tides were found to predominate over 
semidiurnal tides in the OS, with the exception of the 
northern shelf. The relation between amplitudes of 
main diurnal and semidiurnal tides R reaches 
maximal values in the semidiurnal tide amphidromic 
areas (Yamskie Islands, Sakhalinsky Bay, eastern 
Sakhalin shelf). Tidal amplitude reaches maximal 
values in the northern, eastern, and especially 
northeastern parts of the OS. It is significantly 
smaller in the southwestern part of OS, in the central 
part of Japan Sea, and in the Pacific Ocean far from 
the Kuril Ridge.  
 
The mean amplitude of residual oscillations indicates 
zones of intensive eddy formations in the deep 
Kuril–Kamchatka Trench. Its maximal values are

found in the areas adjacent to Hokkaido–South Kuril 
Islands and southeastern Kamchatka–North Kuril 
Islands; smaller values are found in the area of the 
Middle Kuril Islands. High residual amplitudes on 
northern OS shelf and western Hokkaido shelf are 
caused by seasonal changes of sea level and 
circulation.

Abstract 
 
Observations from the Multi-functional Transport Satellite (MTSAT)-1R show that Okhotsk sea ice flowed 
southward in the Nemuro Strait and reached the northern coast of the Nemuro peninsula on February 25, 2008.  
Wind data from Cape Nossapu and Rausu town indicate that a north-northwesterly to northwesterly winter 
monsoon wind with speeds of 5 to 10 m/s blew across the sea surface all day long and drove sea surface ice 
and water southward. Sea-ice drift from the Nemuro Strait through the Goyoumai Pass to the Pacific Ocean 
was clearly observed on February 28 and 29 by MTSAT-1R.  The direction of the sea-ice drift in the Pacific 
was distinctly southwestward during this period against west-northwesterly to southwesterly wind of speeds 2 
to 8 m/s.  The Oyashio Current is a possible factor for southwestward drift of sea ice. Sea-ice flow from the 
Nemuro Strait through the Goyoumai Pass and its drift in the Pacific Ocean were also observed on March 2, 3, 
7, 8 and 9 by MTSAT-1R.  In these cases, the path of sea-ice drift was near the coast along the Coastal 
Oyashio Current. Sea ice finally floated off Tokachi District and parts of them reached the shores of the Pacific 
coast of southeastern Hokkaido around Kushiro city on March 8 due to a westerly to south-southwesterly 
winds of 3 to 18 m/s which started on March 7 and continued until March 9.  
 
 
Introduction 
 
Okhotsk sea ice reached the shores of the Pacific 
coast of southeastern Hokkaido, around Kushiro city 
on March 8, 2008.  During late February to early 
March, sea ice usually drifts into the Nemuro Strait 
from the Okhotsk Sea and flows to the Pacific Ocean 
through the Goyoumai Pass.  However, sea ice does 
not frequently reach the shores of the Pacific coast of 
Hokkaido. 
 
Uda and Watanabe (1936) reported sea-ice drift off 
the Pacific coast of southeast Hokkaido. Uda (1943) 
and Akagawa (1959) studied the melting process of 
drifting sea ice in this region by the theoretical 
approach. Akagawa (1964) pointed out the hazard of 
sea ice to shipping and fisheries, focusing on the 
drifting of sea ice in the Pacific Ocean.  
 
Sea ice carries freshwater, salt, organic matter, stones 
and nutrients, which provide a productive 
environment for creatures, for example, 
phytoplankton, zooplankton, seaweed, shellfish, 
fishes and mammals. These include ice algae, krill, 
tangle, sea urchins, scallops, abalone, crabs, walleye 
pollock, seals, dolphins and whales. However, sea 
ice sometimes poses a threat to seaweed, especially 
tangle, by scraping along on the shores which causes 
continual damage to the ecosystem. 
 
Floating sea ice can block access to bays, ports and 
navigation routes, disrupting both the transport of 
goods and the economic infrastructure. One 
dangerous aspect of sea ice is its ability to damage 
ships and cause disasters at sea. On March 17, 1970, 
sea ice destroyed 8 fishing boats and 30 fishermen 
went missing as they attempted to make their way to 
Hitokappu Bay on Etorofu Island while fleeing a 
severe storm in the Pacific Ocean. 
 
Okhotsk Sea gateways such as the Soya and Nemuro 
straits play an important role in the environment of 
the Japan Sea and Pacific Ocean by transporting sea 
ice through them from the Okhotsk Sea. Sea-ice 
rafted materials are carried to remote areas through 
the gateways. Figure 1 shows the land–sea 
distribution and bottom topography in the study area. 
Goyoumai Pass, to the south of the Nemuro Strait, is 
the most important gateway for the Pacific coast of 
eastern Hokkaido since it faces Cape Nossapu and is 
closest to the eastern coast of Hokkaido.

in the study area.  Rausu town, Cape Nossapu, and Kushiro city are marked by solid circles. 
 
The purpose of the present study is to investigate the 
path of sea-ice drift and to detect the dominant 
forcing factors of the drift, focusing on the drift that 
reached the shores of the Pacific coast of 
southeastern Hokkaido around Kushiro on March 8, 
2008. In the next section, the dataset used in this 
study is described. Four observed events of sea-ice 
drift, which are southward sea-ice drift in the 
Nemuro Strait, sea-ice drift along the Oyashio 
Current, sea-ice drift along the Coastal Oyashio 
Current and sea-ice drift reaching the shores of 
southeastern Hokkaido around Kushiro in late 
February and early March, are presented in the next 4 
sections after which we discuss the problems of 
Okhotsk sea-ice drifting to adjacent oceans through 
the gateways. A summary of the results and our 
proposal for future work are presented in the final 
section.  
 
Dataset 
 
The data used in this study are satellite data, 
atmospheric reanalysis data, meteorological data at 
observational stations and oceanic reanalysis data. 
Satellite data are obtained by Multi-functional 
Transport Satellite (MTSAT)-1R visible sensors for 
each hour. Atmospheric reanalysis data are daily 
wind stress from the Japanese 25-year Reanalysis 
Project (JRA25) (Onogi et al., 2007). Meteorological 
data are wind data observed at Rausu town, Cape 
Nossapu and Kushiro city. Oceanic reanalysis data 
are daily surface currents from MOVE/MRI.COM-
WNP, which is the western North Pacific version of 
the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) 
multivariate ocean variational estimation (MOVE) 
system (Usui et al., 2006) using the MRI community 
ocean model (MRI.COM) (Ishikawa et al., 2005; 
Tsujino and Fujii, 2007; Nakano et al., 2008). The 
model does not represent tidal currents explicitly but 
tidal mixing is expressed by the estimation of St. 
Laurent et al. (2002). 
 
In order to study sea-ice drift, clear MTSAT-1R 
images of hourly sea-ice conditions on February 25, 
28 to 29, and March 2 to 3 and 7 to 9 were selected. 
The spatial resolution of the satellite observation was 
1 km, which can resolve narrow sea ice bands and 
streams of about 10 km. The time resolution of the 
satellite observation was 1 h, which is suitable for 
studying sea-ice drift with timescales of about 1 to 3 
days. 
 
Southward sea-ice drift in the Nemuro Strait

2008. Figure 2 shows sea-ice conditions in the 
Nemuro Strait at 10 and 16 Japan Standard Time 
(JST) on February 25, observed by MTSAT-1R. Sea 
ice moved 8 km southward within 6 h, with an 
average speed of about 35 cm/s. It reached the 
northern coast of the Nemuro peninsula at 16 JST.  
 
As shown in Figure 3, a low-pressure field developed in 
the northern North Pacific. A strong northwesterly wind 
with a cold surge was induced in the southwestern part 
of the low-pressure field, and passed over Rausu town 
and Cape Nossapu on February 25. Clouds of Karman 
Vortex in the upper right corner of Figure 2, top, clearly 
reveal the north-northwestern wind over the ocean off 
eastern Hokkaido at 10 JST, February 25.

Wind vectors for each hour on February 25 at 
observational stations in Rausu town, Cape Nossapu 
and Kushiro city are shown in Figure 4. The data at 
Rausu town and Cape Nossapu indicate that north-
northwesterly to northwesterly winter monsoon 
winds with speeds of 5 to 10 m/s blew across the sea 
ice continuously for more than a half day.

Figure 5 shows the surface current around eastern 
Hokkaido on February 25 from MOVE/MRI.COM-
WNP. The Oyashio Current flows southwestward 
over the continental slope along the contours of 2000 
to 5000 m depth (see Fig. 1) with about 80 km width, 
influenced by an anti-cyclonic eddy of about 160 km 
in diameter. The speed of the Oyashio Current is 
estimated to be 60 cm/s in the center of its jet. In the 
Okhotsk Sea, meandering currents with speeds of of 
35 cm/s are represented by a 30 km width along the 
contours of depths 100 to 1000 m north of Shiretoko 
Peninsula and Kunashiri Island. Over the continental 
shelf, at depths shallower than 100 m, a Coastal 
Oyashio Current of width 20 km develops with a 
west-southwestward velocity of 30 cm/s along the 
Pacific coast around the Goyoumai Pass.  
 
A weak southward current of 10 cm/s is produced in the 
Nemuro Strait, connecting the Okhotsk meandering 
current with the Coastal Oyashio Current. A southward 
flow of sea ice and surface water was driven by north-
northwesterly to northwesterly winds which blew 
across the Nemuro Strait all day long. 
 
Sea-ice drift along the Oyashio Current 
 
Figure 6 shows sea-ice conditions off the south-
eastern coast of Hokkaido at 10 JST on February 28 
and 29 by MTSAT-1R. Sea ice flowed east-
southeastward from the Nemuro Strait to the Pacific 
through the Goyoumai Pass. After sea ice flowed out 
to the Pacific, it turned southwestward as it crossed 
the Coastal Oyashio Current. The southwestward 
drift of sea ice continued for 50 km off the 
southeastern coast of Hokkaido along the Oyashio 
Current, forming a sea-ice band of about 10 km. The 
southernmost edge of the sea-ice band moved about 
25 km in one day, from February 28 to 29, with an 
average speed of about 30 cm/s. 
 
The sea-ice band had a wavy structure with a 
wavelength of about 10 km. The band usually 
consists of many sizes, thickness and types of floes 
such as rotten ice, brash ice, small floes and 
hummock ice. Sea ice in the southern part of the 
band melted on February 29, probably due to heating 
from warmer seawater above freezing point in the 
warm and saline open ocean region. 
 
Reanalyzed daily surface wind stress fields over the 
northwestern North Pacific and the adjacent seas on  
February 28 and 29 are shown in Figure 7. A low-

the Okhotsk Sea. Cyclonic winds in a low-pressure 
field caused west-northwesterly to southwesterly 
winds in the southern region off the southeastern 
coast of Hokkaido.  
 
Figure 8 shows wind vectors for each hour at 
observational stations in Rausu town, Cape Nossapu 
and Kushiro city on February 28 and 29. West-
northwesterly and southwesterly winds were clearly 
observed as the dominant winds, with a maximum 
wind speed of 8 m/s. The direction of the wind off 
the southeastern coast of Hokkaido is west-
northwesterly to southwesterly as shown in Figure 7, 
which is different from that of sea-ice drift toward 
the southwest as shown in Figure 6.

Figure 9 shows daily surface currents around  eastern 
Hokkaido on  February 28 and 29 from MOVE/ 
MRI.COM-WNP. The Oyashio Current flows mainly 
southwestward off the southeastern coast of 
Hokkaido as seen in Figures 5 and 9. The direction 
and magnitude of the sea-ice drift shown in Figure 6 
are the same as those of the Oyashio Current. 
 
From atmospheric and oceanic reanalyzed data, it is 
seen that sea-ice drifted southwestward along the 
Oyashio Current against a west-northwesterly to 
southwesterly wind on February 28 and 29. The 
southwestward drift of sea ice was probably driven 
by water stress due to the Oyashio Current.  
 
Sea-ice drift along the Coastal Oyashio Current 
 
MTSAT-1R clearly observed sea-ice drift along the 
Coastal Oyashio Current from March 2 to 3, 2008. 
Figure 10 shows sea-ice conditions off the 
southeastern coast of Hokkaido at 11 JST on March 
2 and 3, 2008.  Sea ice flowed from the Goyoumai 
Pass and spread west-southwestward, forming an 
extended sea-ice band about 20 km off the coast. The 
southernmost edge of the sea-ice band moved about 
35 km in one day, from March 2 to 3, with an 
average speed of about 40 cm/s.  
 
The sea-ice band had a wavy structure with 
wavelength of about 10 km, similar to that observed 
on February 28 and 29.  However, it drifted closer to 
the coast and remained intact for a longer time, 
probably due to the colder sea water (near freezing 
point) around it.

system induced a northwesterly wind over eastern 
Hokkaido. The strength of the northwesterly wind 
stress was less than 1 N/m

.  
 
Figure 12 shows wind vectors for each hour at 
observational stations in Rausu town, Cape Nossapu

Northwesterly winds were observed to be the  
 
dominant winds at stations in Rausu town and Cape 
Nossapu, with a maximum wind speed of 5 m/s.  
 
As revealed in Figure 11, the direction of the wind 
off the southeastern coast of Hokkaido is north-
westerly, different from the southwestward direction 
of sea-ice drift, as shown in Figure 10. 
 
Figure 13 shows the daily surface current around 
eastern Hokkaido on March 2 and 3, 2008 from 
MOVE/MRI.COM-WNP. The west-southwestward 
Coastal Oyashio Current flowed south of the 
Goyoumai Pass and developed significantly, with 
speeds of 30 to 40 cm/s, on March 3.  The directions 
and magnitudes were exactly the same as those for 
sea-ice drift observed off the southeastern coast of 
Hokkaido (see Fig. 10).

These atmospheric and oceanic reanalyzed data 
suggest that observed west-southwestward sea-ice 
drift on March 2 and 3 is probably driven mainly by 
water stress due to the development of the Coastal 
Oyashio Current. Both the Oyashio Current over the 
continental slope and the anti-cyclonic eddy in the 
open ocean are clearly revealed in Figures 5, 9 and 
13. However, the Coastal Oyashio Current varied 
over a shorter time scale (days). Coastal ocean 
response to the atmospheric cyclone might be a key 
factor in the variability of the Coastal Oyashio 
Current and sea-ice drift along it.

Figure 16 shows the wind vectors for each hour at 
observational stations in Rausu town, Cape Nossapu

to south-southwesterly winds, with speeds of 3 to 18 
cm/s, were observed at stations in Cape Nopssapu 
and Kushiro city for three days. 
 
The Coastal Oyashio Current is estimated to have 
weakened to less than 10 cm/s (see Fig. 17), while 
the Oyashio Current and anti-cyclonic eddy are 
represented as stronger currents over the continental 
slope. The direction of the Coastal Oyashio Current 
was offshore south of Kushiro, which is opposite to 
that of sea-ice drift toward the shore around Kushiro. 
Based on atmospheric and oceanic reanalysis data, a 
possible factor for sea ice reaching the shores of 
southeastern Hokkaido around Kushiro on March 8, 
2008 is a strong westerly to south-southwesterly 
wind, lasting for several days near the coast. 
 
Discussion 
 
The path of sea-ice drift along the Coastal Oyashio 
Current is clearly observed by MTSAT-1R. Sea ice 
melts during the drift and, as Ohtani (1989) 
mentioned, acts as a freshwater source for the 
Coastal Oyashio water which is cold and has low 
salinity. Nakamura et al. (2003) and Kono et al. 
(2004) studied the Coastal Oyashio by model 
simulation and successfully reproduced the Coastal 
Oyashio Current, consistent with the sea-ice path 
identified in the present study. Sea-ice drift from the 
Okhotsk Sea to the Coastal Oyashio region through 
the Nemuro Strait is direct evidence supporting the 
mixing process presented by Oguma et al. (2008), 
from isotopic tracers.

152  PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
Besides present-day sea-ice and Coastal Oyashio 
water conditions mentioned above, Last Glacial 
Maximum (LGM) conditions of sea ice and water are 
also important for the study of the sensitivity of sea ice 
and water in the environment. Ikehara (2003) and 
Sakamoto et al. (2005) reconstructed the history of sea 
ice in the Japan Sea and the Okhotsk Sea, respectively. 
Sea ice might extend to lower latitudes in LGM. Oba 
(2006) reconstructed sea surface temperatures (SST) 
in the western North Pacific and estimated them to be 
about 20 degrees lower in the LGM over the present-
day Kuroshio extension region, which suggests that 
sea ice drifted to lower latitudes along currents with 
eddies and streamers off the eastern coast of Honshu, 
the central island of Japan. 
  
In any epoch, whether the present day, the LGM or 
in a future global warming world, the sea-ice 
trajectory can be expressed by Newton’s second law 
of motion with the Coriolis force. Wind and current 
induce air and water drag and work as a driving force 
for sea-ice drift.  The sea-ice trajectory observed in 
the present study should be expressed by forces from 
both the wind and currents. By solving the 
momentum equation of sea ice, its trajectory can be 
represented and the driving force on it analyzed, as 
Smith (1993), Bigg et al. (1997), Matsumoto (1997) 
and Gladstone et al. (2001) have done for icebergs.  
 
Summary 
 
The path of sea-ice drift from the Okhotsk Sea to the 
Pacific Ocean during late February to early March, 
2008 is investigated and the dominant forcing 
factors of the drift are detected for four sea-ice drift 
events, which are (1) southward sea-ice drift in the 
Nemuro Strait on  February 25, (2) sea-ice drift along 
the Oyashio Current on  February 28 to 29, (3) sea-
ice drift along the Coastal Oyashio Current on 
March 2 to 3 and (4) sea-ice drift reaching the shores 
of southeastern Hokkaido around Kushiro on March 
7 to 9. 
 
As summarized in Figure 18, wind data observed at 
Cape Nossapu and Rausu town reveal that north-
northwesterly to northwesterly wind with speeds of 5 
to 10 m/s drove sea surface ice and water southward 
on February 25 all day long. The sea-ice outflow 
from the Nemuro Strait through the Goyoumai Pass 
to the Pacific Ocean resulted in a distinct 
southwestward drift of sea ice against west-
northwesterly to southwesterly winds of speeds 2 to 
8 m/s, which suggests that the Oyashio Current is a 
possible factor for the southwestward drift of sea ice 
on February 28 to 29. 
 
In the case of Okhotsk sea-ice flow into the Pacific 
Ocean through the Goyoumai Pass on March 2, 3, 7, 
8 and 9, the path of sea-ice drift was near the coast 
along the Coastal Oyashio Current. Sea ice reached 
Tokachi District and parts of it reached the shores of 
southeastern Hokkaido around Kushiro city on 
March 8 due to westerly to south-southwesterly 
winds with speeds of 3 to 18 m/s.  These winds 
started on  March 7 and continued for three days.  
 
It has been shown that the Goyoumai Pass and the 
Coastal Oyashio Current are key factors in the drift 
of Okhotsk sea ice in the Pacific. Based on the 
present research, our proposal for future work is to 
study the role of Okhotsk sea-ice drift through 
gateways such as the Soya Strait, the Nemuro Strait 
and the Goyoumai Pass which link the Okhotsk Sea 
to the Japan Sea and the Pacific Ocean.  We hope to 
use satellite sea-ice data, ocean and atmosphere 
reanalysis data and a sea-ice trajectory model for 
analysis of sea-ice drift driving forces and sea-ice 
rafted material fluxes.

Winds in the Goyoumai Pass and off the coast of Kushiro 
are key factors for sea-ice spreading into the Pacific from 
the Nemuro Strait and reaching the shores around Kushiro 
off Tokachi District, respectively. The Coastal Oyashio 
Current is a key factor for west-southwestward sea-ice 
drift from the south of Goyoumai Pass to the east of 
Tokachi District along the southeastern coast of Hokkaido.

Introduction 
 
The Okhotsk Sea Water flows into the Pacific Ocean 
through gaps of the southern Kuril Islands, as 
discussed in several papers in this workshop.  Along 
the East Coast of Hokkaido, a narrow coastal band of 
cold and less saline water is usually found in the first 
half of the year and a narrow band of warm and 
saline water is found in the second half of the year. 
The former water type is referred to as the Coastal 
Oyashio (e.g., Ohtani 1980; Isoda et al., 2003; Kono 
et al., 2004), and the latter will be called the Coastal 
Warm Current in this paper.  Combining these two 
currents, Ogasawra (1990) called these currents the 
East Hokkaido Coastal Current. 
 
The Hokkaido Fisheries Research Institute set a 
moored current system in the flow region of the East 
Hokkaido Coastal Current during the period from 
May 2003 to May 2004. Observations were 
conducted at four depths ranging from 16 m to 76 m. 
It was found that the currents exhibit considerable 
short-period variations.  Variation patterns are very 
similar for all depths, though the magnitude of the 
current tends to decrease with depth.  The current 
directions are identical for all depths and are 
southwestward (parallel to the coastline, and stable 
throughout year; Ohtani, 1980) suggesting that the 
origin of the Coastal Oyashio Water could be melted 
sea ice water from the Okhotsk Sea because of its 
low temperature and low salinity.  Also, the origin of 
the East Hokkaido Warm Current could originate 
from the Soya Current in the Okhotsk Sea because of 
its high temperature and high salinity. 
 
However, the flow paths of these waters remain 
unknown.  In this paper, the seasonal variations of 
the oceanic states in the sea to the east of Hokkaido 
are analyzed by using the observed data from the 
Hokkaido Kushiro Fisheries Experimental Stations in 
order to explore this problem. 
Data 
 
The Hokkaido Kushiro Fisheries Experimental Station 
keeps a routine observation network in the sea to the 
east of Hokkaido. The distribution of the observation 
points improved considerably after 1990, with 
temperature and salinity profiles now taken six times 
per year (usually in February, April, June, August, 
October and December). The distribution of the 
observation points is shown in Figure 1. We analyze 
mainly the area north of 42°N, and investigate the 
cross-sectional distributions of temperature and 
salinity along four north–south observation lines: P1, 
PK0, P2, PK1, and P3 (from east to west). We used 
7 years of data, from 1990 to 1996. The observations 
were conducted in May instead of June from 1990 
through 1993 and in July instead of August in 1992. 
Otherwise, it is assumed that observations were made 
in June or August for this analysis.

Temperature and salinity values show considerable 
seasonal variations, and the temperature and salinity 
distributions are changeable month by month. 
Sometimes the horizontal distribution patterns 
change considerably with selected depths. So, we 
confine our attention to the configurations of the 
temperature and salinity contours in the cross-
sectional fields only. We examined the temperature 
and salinity fields independently, and checked 
whether or not the coastal band of colder or warmer 
water in the temperature field could be seen just near 
the coast, and whether or not that of less or more 
saline water could be found along the coast. 
Appearance status of the East Hokkaido Coastal 
Current  
 
All of the observed temperature and salinity cross-
sectional distributions were examined for the period 
from 1990 to 1996, and the grade of appearance is 
determined for each observation month, for each 
observation line and for each standard depth. The 
results are shown in Figure 4 (Period I: February, 
April, and June) and in Figure 5 (Period II: August, 
October, and December). In each column, the left 
side symbol is for the temperature field and right side 
symbol is for the salinity field. As shown in the
Sea ice, watermass and freshwater processes/Coastal lagoons 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  157 
lower column of Figures 2 and 3, the East Hokkaido 
Coastal Current (the Coastal Oyashio and the East 
Hokkaido Warm Current) appears as closed 
isotherms or isohalines attached to the coastal slope. 
The grades of appearance are determined as follows. 
The grade is 5 if the East Hokkaido Warm Current is 
seen with well closed contours, and is shown in 
Figures 4 and 5 with open circles. The grade is 3 if 
the contours are not so well closed, and is shown 
with open squares. The grade is 1 if warmer or more 
saline water exists but is doubtful as contours are not 
closed or have irregular forms, and is shown in 
figures with open triangles. Similarly, we also 
determined the grades for the Coastal Oyashio: –5 
(closed circles) for very clear cases, –3 (closed 
squares) for clear cases, and –1 (closed triangles) for 
ambiguous cases. If no coastal current is seen, the 
grade is 0, and is shown with an × mark. The values 
of the grade are used for statistical analysis in the 
next section. 
 
The difference between Figures 4 and 5 is easily 
recognized. Figure 4 is much darker than Figure 5 as 
black symbols are dominant, while Figure 5 shows 
more white symbols. This indicates that the coastal 
band of cold and less saline water appears frequently 
in Period I, while that of the warm and saline water 
appears frequently in Period II. Period I is the season 
of the Coastal Oyashio and Period II is the season of 
the East Hokkaido Warm Current. 
 
In Figure 4 dark shading decreases from February 
through June, and the grade of appearance is highest 
in February. Similar monthly changes can also be 
seen in Figure 5. The grade of appearance is almost 
identical for August and October, but for December 
is considerably darker, especially in 1996: the 
Coastal Oyashio appears to exist sometimes in 
December. 
 
In both figures the Coastal Oyashio is seen more 
clearly in the salinity field than in the temperature 
field, while the East Hokkaido Warm Current is seen 
more clearly in the temperature field than in the 
salinity field. To get a better representation, we 
performed a statistical analysis by replacing the 
symbols in Figures 4 and 5 with numbers, described 
in the next section.

cold or less saline water is observed at the station nearest to the coast.  White symbols indicate that warm or saline water is 
observed at the station nearest to the coast. Circles represent “very clear” cases, squares “clear” cases and triangles 
“ambiguous” cases.  If no isolated water is found or if the observation point is outside of the isolated water, an × mark is 
shown. The month with an * indicates that data of the former month were used.

Numerical representation 
 
By using the numerical values of the grade of 
appearance, we calculated the appearance indices 
averaged over 7 years (over 6 years for the P1 and 
PK0 lines) for each observation line, at each depth 
and for each month. Then, we averaged over the 
observation lines to find out how the appearance 
index changes if the observation depth is changed. 
The results for period I (February, April and June) 
are shown in upper row in Figure 6, and those for 
Period II (August, October and December) in lower 
row in Figure 6. The solid lines indicate the variation 
of the temperature index, and the dotted lines denote 
that of the salinity index. 
 
All of the indices for Period I lie only in the negative 
domain (except for February, near 200 m depth), 
indicating that Period I is the season of the Coastal 
Oyashio. The indices for Period II lie in the positive 
domain (except near 200 m depth, and for salinity in 
December), indicating that Period II is the season of the 
East Hokkaido Warm Current. The magnitude of the 
salinity indices is always larger than that of the 
temperature indices in Period I, showing that the 
Coastal Oyashio appears more clearly in the salinity 
distributions. On the other hand, the magnitude of the 
temperature indices is larger than that of the salinity 
indices, except for the near surface layers in August, as 
indicated by the East Hokkaido Warm Current 
appearing more clearly in the temperature distributions. 
   
The magnitudes of the salinity indices in Period I 
decrease monotonically with depth and keep a value 
less than –4 while the indices (especially temperature 
indices) in August and October show the maxima near 
50–75 m depth. Temperature and salinity cross-
sections were averaged over 7 years from 1990 to 
1996 and the results obtained along the Pk0 line for 
August are shown in Figure 7. In the summer season 
from August through October, along all of the 
observation lines, the surface layer is characterized by 
high temperature and less saline waters. This surface 
layer is generated by sea surface warming and 
precipitation in summer. The signature of the East 
Hokkaido Warm Current near surface appears to be 
hidden by this warm and less saline water. Thus, the 
East Hokkaido Warm Current is observed most easily 
in the mid-layers of 50–75 m depth. 
 
The situation in December is very special. The 
temperature indices show high positive values except 
at 200 m depth, indicating that December is the 
season of the East Hokkaido Warm Current. 
However, the salinity indices show small negative 
values between 0 and –1.  This corresponds to the 
appearance of black and white symbols with almost 
the same frequency in Figure 5.  The situation differs 
Sea ice, watermass and freshwater processes/Coastal lagoons 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  159 
year by year, and the condition which is favorable to 
the Coastal Oyashio already appears in December, at 
least in some years.  
   
The variations of the temperature and salinity indices 
against the observation lines were also calculated in a 
similar way.  The results are shown in Figure 8.  It 
should be noted that the magnitudes of the indices in 
February and in April tend to increase when the 
observation line moves from east to west, indicating 
the structure of the Coastal Oyashio is weakened 
from east to west.  The indices of both temperature 
and salinity in October and that of salinity in August 
tend to decrease from east to west.  The temperature 
index might be influenced by the surface warm water 
layers. This appears to indicate that the structure of 
the East Hokkaido Warm Current is weakened from 
east to west. The indices in June and December do 
not show a clear tendency, but this could be because 
the Coastal Oyashio or the East Hokkaido Current is 
not clearly defined for these months, as seen in 
Figures 4 and 5.  This would indicate that the waters 
of the Coastal Oyashio and the East Hokkaido Warm 
Current are carried from the sea to the northeast, 
namely to the area near the southern Kuril Islands.

Seasonal changes of the East Hokkaido Coastal 
Current 
 
Ogasawara (1990) discussed the seasonal changes of 
water type for the East Hokkaido Coastal Current, 
and schematically showed its migration on a T-S 
diagram by analyzing specific one year data. As 
discussed in the previous section, the appearance 
indices for the Coastal Oyashio Water decrease 
below 50 m depth, and those for the East Hokkaido 
Warm Current have maxima at 50–75 m depth. In 
order to discuss seasonal changes of water type, we 
chose two stations nearest to the coast along each 
observation line, and the temperature and salinity 
values at the depth of 50 m are used. 
 
We collected the data points which are located inside 
the coastal band of the Coastal Oyashio or the East 
Hokkaido Warm Current, and water types were 
plotted on T-S diagrams for each month (EHCC 
plot). The results are shown in the first and third 
rows in Figure 9.  All of the water types are plotted 
as reference in the second and fourth rows 
(Reference plot). The temperature range in June is 
much greater in the Reference plot compared to the 
EHCC plot, indicting that the water could be

 influenced by the warm surface layer which prevails 
in the summer season. Generally, the areas of the 
Reference plots have a broader temperature range 
than those of the EHCC plots, but it should be noted 
that the distribution area for EHCC plots lie well 
inside of that of the Reference plot for each month. 
This means that the water type of the East Hokkaido 
Coastal Current has almost the same characteristics 
as the surrounding waters for each month and that 
the East Hokkaido Coastal Current (the Coastal 
Oyashio and the East Hokkaido Warm Current) 
could not be identified by its water type. 
 
The water type of the East Hokkaido Coastal Current 
for each month is plotted altogether on a T-S 
diagram in Figure 10. The water type distribution of 
the Coastal Oyashio (in Period I) is confined in the 
domain below 4°C, while that of the East Hokkaido 
Current (in Period II) is restricted to the domain 
above 4°C.

As seen in Figure 5, the structure of the Coastal 
Oyashio may appear in December in some years. The 
water types in December are plotted in Figure 11 for 
three typical cases: case (1) in which the structure of 
the Coastal Oyashio is seen at least in the salinity 
cross-section, case (2) in which no East Hokkaido 
Warm Current is seen either in temperature or in 
salinity cross-sections, and case (3) in which no 
coastal band is seen along the coast. The domain of 
these water types are distributed overlapping one 
another. The water types of case (1) tend to have a 
lower salinity distribution, but their temperature and 
salinity values are considerably different from those 
in February and April when the typical Coastal 
Oyashio appears. The structure similar to the Coastal 
Oyashio in December might be called a forerunner of 
the Coastal Oyashio, but it should be mentioned that 
the water type is considerably different from the 
typical Coastal Oyashio. 
 
Conclusions 
 
It has been shown that the first half of the year is the 
season of the Coastal Oyashio, and the second half is 
that of the East Hokkaido Warm Current. The 
Coastal Oyashio shows the clearest appearance in 
February. A structure like the Coastal Oyashio is 
seen in December in some years.  This means that 
the source of the Coastal Oyashio cannot be traced to 
the melt water of the sea ice in the Okhotsk Sea, 
otherwise, the Coastal Oyashio would be clearest in 
or after April.  
 
In the summer season, the East Hokkaido Warm 
Current is hard to recognize because the surface 
layers of the area under consideration are covered by 
warm and less saline water.  So, the temperature and 
salinity structures at 50 m depth appear to be the 
most suitable to analyze the seasonal changes in 
water type of the East Hokkaido Coastal Current (the 
Coastal Oyashio and the East Hokkaido Warm 
Current). The temperature and salinity of the East 
Hokkaido coastal Current Water show considerable 
seasonal variation. Typical water types can be 
determined only for each month.  It is surprising that 
the water type is almost the same for each month 
whether the East Hokkaido Coastal Current exists or 
not.  The water mass appears to have been modified 
before it reaches the region under consideration due 
to warming and precipitation through the sea surface 
or due to the influence of freshwater supply from 
land. This means that water mass analysis is not very 
effective for determining the source of the East 
Hokkaido Coastal Current Water.

Introduction 
 
The Okhotsk Sea is identified as the principal 
ventilation site of the intermediate density waters of 
the North Pacific (Talley, 1991).  This ventilation 
process is driven by an overturn associated with 
brine concentration from sea ice formation at coastal 
polynyas on the northeastern shelf.  Previous studies 
on the source of North Pacific Intermediate Water, or 
on the formation of Kuril Basin Intermediate Water, 
Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water, Okhotsk Sea Mode 
Water or Dense Shelf Water (Watanabe and 
Wakatsuchi, 1998; Galdyshev et al., 2003; Itoh et al., 
2003; Shcherbina et al., 2004a,b; Yamamoto et al., 
2004) have made no reference to the ventilation or 
convection process at the open ocean polynya in the 
eastern part of the Okhotsk Sea. “Winter convection” 
usually means a deepening of the surface mixed layer 
by cooling and stirring by cold air temperatures and 
strong winds, and in the Okhotsk Sea, is reported to 
occur in the upper 100–150 m layer (Moroshkin, 
1966) and is believed to not penetrate below the 
halocline or the temperature minimum layer 
(Gladyshev et al., 2003).  
 
While turning attention to the interannual variation in 
the water adjacent to the Okhotsk Sea, the effect of 
oceanographic processes of the Okhotsk Sea 
appearing in the Oyashio Water, depicted by 
monitoring on the ‘A-line’ by HNFRI/FRA, is the 
increased magnitude and earlier initiation of spring 
blooms after the 1998 regime shift (Kasai et al., 
1997).  This enhancement of primary productivity is 
associated with the increase in the density gradient of 
the water column within the euphotic layer (Kasai et 
al., 1997) by increased temperature or decreased 
salinity in the surface layer (Kasai and Ono, 2007). 
The basis for these changes in oceanographic 
structure may include the interannual changes in the 
waters lying over the intermediate density ranges, 
i.e., the water formed by winter convection.  Thus, 
we need to pay attention to winter convection in the 
Okhotsk Sea.  
 
In visualizing World Ocean Atlas 2005 (WOA05) 
data (Locarnini et al., 2006a,b) using Ocean Data 
View (ODV; Schlitzer, 2006) to obtain a standard 
textbook picture of wintertime surface mixed layer 
convection, we found a pycnostad, i.e., vertically 
dense homogeneous water extending down to ca. 
500 m deep over the eastern part of the Okhotsk Sea 
in January.  A pycnostad reaching this depth in the 
Okhotsk Sea has never been reported.  Thus, this 
paper attempts to describe the pycnostad water, the 
history of its formation or deformation, its 
contribution in water mass formation processes in the 
Okhotsk Sea, and to indicate that pycnostad water is 
nothing more than the evidence of deep winter 
convection.  
 
Pycnostad Water in the Eastern Part of the 
Okhotsk Sea 
 
The WOA05 data indicate the existence of water 
having pycnostads in the eastern part of the Okhotsk 
Sea, in January (Fig. 1). This pycnostad water 
extends down to 300~500 m deep. As shown in 
Figure 2, this pycnostad water is not observed in 
December or February.

The left panel of Figure 3 is the January σ

 section 
at 57.5°N, which runs on the northern shelf and at the 
northern end of TINRO Basin. The pycnostad 
reaching a depth of about 400 m exists on the bottom 
depression corresponding to the northern end of 
TINRO Basin. A low density surface layer of a few 
10s of meters extends from the western (left) side of 
the section, but does not lie over the pycnostad water 
occupying the eastern (right) side of the section.  The 
pycnostad water shows horizontal density variation

, which corresponds to 
that of the water just above the Okhotsk Sea Mode 
Water (26.7 to 27.0 σ

the top of the pycnostad water, there is no surface 
mixed layer, i.e., the surface ‘sky-light’ is open to the 
air and ‘ventilation’ is available.

The middle panel of Figure 3 is the 53.5ºN section, 
which passes through the northern part of Deryugin 
Basin (deeper than 1500 m in the Central Basin and 
east off the northern part of Sakhalin Island). In this 
section, the σ
0
 range of the pycnostad water becomes 
a little denser to 26.5~26.6. The bottom of the 
pycnostad water extends westward along 350 m depth. 
 
The right panel of Figure 3 is the 49.5ºN section, 
extending from the north of Cape Terpeniya to 
Onekotan Island, north of Kruzenshtern Strait. In this 
section, a higher density water mass of well mixed 
Kuril Islands Water appears in the eastern part of the 
section, connects with the pycnostad water interfaced 
by a sharp density front. This suggests that the tidal 
mixing and tidal exchange at/through the Kuril 
Straits have an important roll in the formation of the 
pycnostad water. The pycnostad water becomes 
denser to 26.6~26.7σ

. The detailed structure 
(doming or depression) of the pycnostad water 
shown by shape of the isopycnals (e.g., σ

= 26.6) 
can be interpreted as a result of either dynamic 
balance or local vertical mixing or convection. Thus, 
we must suspend interpretation here, based on a 
specific assumption.  
 
As seen from Figure 3, the core density of the 
pycnostad water becomes less dense towards the 
north. On top of the dense homogeneous water, there 
is a very thin surface mixed layer with a pycnocline 
of moderate density gradient. The vertical gradient of 
σ
0
 in the pycnostad water is as low as an order of 
1 kg   m
–3
   km
–1
 or less. The east–west difference in  
 
density structure in the upper layer (<500 m) 
suggests a geostrophic balance with strong currents, 
including the East Sakhalin Current, driven by a 
strong northerly winter monsoon.  
 
The evidence of pycnostad water identified in the 
density sections can be summarized as follows:  
• The T/S vertical profile compensating each other 
tends to be isopycnic; 
• A horizontal density gradient exists; 
• Depth reaches 300~400 m; 
• The horizontal extent north–south is 1000 km and 
east–west is 300 km; 
• It is observed only in January. 
 
The most important questions to be addressed are 
“What is the nature of this pycnostad?” and “Is it 
merely a deepening of the surface mixed layer or the 
result of simple tidal mixing?” In view of its 
appearance only in January and disappearance in 
February, this pycnostad water may not be a simple 
deepening of the surface mixed layer or the result of 
tidal mixing. 
 
T/S sections of pycnostad water 
 
Figures 4, 5, and 6 represent the temperature and 
salinity sections corresponding to Figure 3. The 
temperature and salinity of the pycnostad water are 
not vertically homogeneous, but compensate each 
other so that the density becomes vertically 
homogeneous, as is clearly shown in the T/S diagram 
of pycnostad water for January (Fig. 11).

The important observations from the above 
temperature and salinity sections are as follows: 
1) Warmer water extending from the North Pacific 
is dominant only in the middle layer of the 
southern part of Central Basin (Fig. 6, left). The 
surface of pycnostad water is covered by water 
colder and less saline compared to the water 
occupying the Kuril Straits. This means that the 
open ocean polynya observed in the eastern half 
of the Central Basin is not caused by the inflow 
of warm North Pacific Water.  
2) Comparing with density sections, the effect of 
salinity dominates in determining density 
structure.  
3) The major source of saline water is the inflow of 
North Pacific Water through the Kuril Straits.  
4) The cold and low salinity water is distributed 
along the western side of the Central Basin, i.e., 
along the coast of Sakhalin Island, but does not 
extend eastward beyond 150ºE.  
 
The open ocean polynya and pycnostad water in the 
eastern part of the Okhotsk Sea had long been 
considered to be formed by the inflow of warm 
North Pacific Water, but this assumption is not 
supported by the temperature and salinity sections of 
Figures 4–6.  Another possible explanation is that the 
polynya in the eastern part of the Okhotsk Sea can be 
formed and maintained, not by heat advection from 
the Pacific Ocean, but by mechanical processes, such 
as wind and/or currents. Thus, the pycnostad water 
could be formed by the result of local processes, e.g., 
upwelling or vertical mixing or convection.  
 
These two explanations bring quite different points 
of view on the watermass formation and 
modification process in the Okhotsk Sea. In order to 
answer the question “What will happen when sea ice 
of the Okhotsk Sea disappears due to global 
warming?”, the cause and results of the open ocean 
polynya and pycnostad water in the eastern part of 
Okhotsk Sea will be very important.  
 
Formation and Deformation of Pycnostad 
Water 
 
Time evolution from December to January/ 
January to February 
 
To look for evidence on possible formation 
mechanisms of the pycnostad water, the difference in 
time between December and January for the cross-
sections of temperature, salinity and σ
0
 in each 
section is shown in Figures 7, 8, 9. The T/S diagrams 
for December and January are shown in Figures 10 
and 11, respectively. 
 
The remarkable changes occurring from December to 
January are: 
1) The density decrease of almost the entire water 
column of the Central Basin, except for the 
upper 100 m. The degree of decrease is more 
intense in the northern part;  
2) The density increase of the surface mixed layer 
shallower than about 100 m in the middle and 
eastern portions of the sections;   
3) The increase of salinity in the middle layer of the 
central section and decrease of temperature in 
the middle layer of the southern section. These 
changes may be the result of freezing.  
 
These changes in temperature and salinity are shown 
in the general pattern of the T/S profiles between 
December and January (Figs. 10–11). The December 
T/S profile (Fig. 10) conserves characteristics similar 
to those of the Okhotsk Sea in summer time, i.e., a 
fresh and warm surface layer, temperature minimum 
layer and deep temperature maximum.  
 
The temperature minimum layer disappears from 
January T/S profiles (Fig. 11), while those of the 
surface/middle layer align parallel to isopycnals 
instead. The positions where the surface or 
intermediate layer T/S profiles are aligning 
correspond almost to the position of the temperature 
minimum layer in December (26.4~26.7σ
0
), except 
at the shallow stations on the shelf. The aligned T/S 
profiles of the pycnostad water are the result of a 
salinity increase and temperature decrease in the 
surface water, and a salinity decrease and 
temperature increase or decrease in the water just 
below temperature minimum layer in December. 
This change means that the distribution of T/S plots 
becomes more compact. In other words, the 
uniformity of the water mass increases. The deep 
temperature maximum moves to a lower salinity and 
higher temperature position in January. Thus, we can 
see that the pycnostad water is formed by a density 
increase in the surface mixed layer of thickness 
ca.100 m, and by a density decrease in the rest of the 
water column.

The density increases of the surface layer in the 
eastern and central portion of sections are caused by 
an increase of salinity and decrease of temperature. 
These changes in T/S could be the result of vertical 
mixing with the lower layer.  However, as shown in 
Figure 9, the increase of surface mixed layer salinity 
is most outstanding at the Kuril Straits, where 
salinity increases over whole water column. The tidal 
mixing at the Kuril Straits could transport higher 
salinity water from the deep layer, or from East 
Kamchatka Current Water. If the West Kamchatka 
Current, forming the northward flow of counter-
clockwise circulation as the eastern side of the 
Okhotsk Sea circulation dominates, this saline water 
could be transported north along the western shelf 
slope of the Kamchatka coast. However, the 
existence of a sharp front, bounding the tidal mixing 
zone around the Kuril Islands, makes the explanation 
by simple advection of a water mass through it 
difficult, and needs to be explained using transport 
by tidal currents, i.e., tidal exchange.  
The decrease in density in the lower layer of the 
sections corresponds to the decrease in salinity and 
partly to the increase in temperature, though the 
contribution of the latter is not remarkable. However, 
what is notable is the decrease in salinity of the lower 
layer in the northern section as shown in the middle 
panel of Figure 7, and the increase in temperature of 
middle layer in the southern section as shown in the 
left panel of Figure 9.  
 
As the changes in temperature and/or salinity from 
December to January are different in the layers, 
explaining the mechanisms of changes by isopycnal 
mixing will be not easy. Possible mechanisms of 
decreasing density by a decrease in salinity in the 
lower layer of the northern section can be vertical 
mixing, convection by surface cooling, and 
strengthening of the cyclonic gyre.  Among these, the 
only mechanism that can generate a pycnostad with 
compensating T/S distribution is the sinking of the 
water parcel by a density increase to the depth with 
same density, i.e., cooling convection.  
 
In the February T/S diagram (Fig. 12), for the same 
water for Figures 10 and 11, the vertically dense 
homogeneous water is not so developed as in January. 
However, through careful examination of Figure 12, 
we will find the following features; (1) the pycnostad 
waters starting from the surface still exist in the lower 
salinity stations, i.e., in the stations on the shelf; (2) 
the middle layer pycnostad waters can be indentified 
in the intermediate density layer ( σ
θ
 = 26.8 ~ 27.1). 
The possible mechanism forming intermediate 
pycnostad layer can be diapycnal mixing by tidal 
currents and bottom topography. This is an important 
and interesting phenomenon, but in order to focus of 
this paper on the formation mechanism of the 
pycnostad layer starting from the surface, here it is 
sufficient to just point out this phenomenon.

Changes in volume of water for density ranks 
 
The changes in the volume of water for each density 
rank are clearly shown by comparing the occurrence 
of σ
0
 ranks in each section between January and 
February (Fig. 13). As the occurrences are counted 
for data of standard depths, having different spacing 
from surface to depth, the counts of occurrence are 
not equally comparable between different σ
0
 ranks. 
 
The formation of pycnostad water is clearly shown as 
dominant peaks in the January histogram (Fig. 13, 
upper panel) at σ
0
 of 26.2~26.7, which corresponds 
to the density range of the water just above the 
Okhotsk Sea Mode Water in the Okhotsk Sea, and to 
the density range of Oyashio Water just above the 
temperature minimum layer or around the salinity 
minimum layer. This formation can still be observed 
among the histogram peaks in February when the 
pycnostad water is already deformed. However, the 
volume of water having higher σ of 26.75~27.1 
increases between January and February. At the same 
time, the volume of water having a lower density 
increases in the northern section. Thus, winter is the 
season when the water masses of surface,  
 
intermediate and deeper layers are formed through 
typical mechanisms, including that which forms 
pycnostad water. 
 
Is it Deep Convection? 
 
The most plausible formation process of this 
pycnostad water, having a signature of aligned T/S 
profiles, is ‘deep convection’, because this signature 
is quite similar and unique to that of deep convection 
sites, such as the Gulf of Lions, south of France 
(Schott et al., 1996) and/or the Labrador Sea (Lilly et 
al., 1999). The T/S profiles for these deep convection 
sites produced from WOA05 data also indicate the 
existence of a pycnostad exhibiting T/S profiles 
aligning along the isopycnals (Fig. 14). 
 
The semblance of the T/S profiles may not be 
enough to identify winter convection as the process 
responsible for the formation of the pycnostad. Thus, 
we must first present an overview of past studies in 
order to understand the specific requirements of 
winter deep convection;  then those requirements 
may be examined for the case of eastern part of 
Okhotsk Sea.

The development of convective overturn is well 
illustrated not only through intensive field studies by 
Schott et al. (1996) and Lilly et al. (1999), but also 
through a series of laboratory tank experiments by 
Maxworthy and Narimousa (1994) and through a 
series of plume-resolving numerical model 
experiments by Send and Marshall (1995).  
 
Deep convection in the Gulf of Lions and the 
Labrador Sea 
 
Based on extensive observations, the development of 
deep convection in the Gulf of Lions (Send and 
Marshall, 1995; Schott et al., 1996) can be outlined 
as follows: 
1) The situation leading to deep convection is based 
on a permanently present cyclonic circulation. 
2) This cyclonic circulation leads to a doming of 
the isopycnals with shallowest mixed layer 
depths. 
3) Cold and dry offshore winds blow from the land 
over the isopycnal dome: the Mistral out of the 
Rhone Valley and the Tramontane from the 
Pyrenees. 
4) With continued cooling during the early phase of 
winter, the upper layer continues to be cooler, 
deeper, and saltier by entraining warm and saline 
water from below. 
5) The stability against the weakly stratified 
sublayer is reduced enough for deep convection 
to set in. 
6) The downwelling velocities (exceeding 10 cm   
s
–1
) of dense water plumes ‘raining down’ from 
surface mixed layer are compensated by 
upwelling velocities in between the ‘convection 
plumes’ and thus the integral effects of a patch 
of convection plumes are mainly to act in mixing 
the water column vertically and do not act as the 
mechanism of net vertical mass transfer. 
7) These convective plumes comprise a convection 
region called the ‘Convection Chimney’ of 
50~100 km scale. 
8) A ‘rim current’ is generated around the edge of 
the convection regime, in thermal wind balance 
with the density gradient between the interior of 
the regime and the exterior.  
9) The rim current develops meanders and 
instability eddies. These eddies break up the 
convection chimney into ‘cones’. The heavy 
water in the cones propagates and slumps down 
to its neutrally buoyant level, adding extra 
volume to the deep water.  
10) Under weakened forcing, a thin stratified surface 
layer of warmer water moves in by lateral 
advection and forms capping over convection 
water.  
11) Immediately following the end of convection, 
the convection region is a mixture of cold/fresh 
and warm/salty water, which soon settles down 
into a more isopycnally homogeneous and 
vertically stratified state through the sorting and 
mixing of lateral fine structure.  
 
The Labrador Sea is one of the deepest convection 
sites in the world ocean. Air temperatures at nearby 
Iqaluit can average colder than –30ºC during winter 
months, when northerly and northwesterly winds can 
average 6 m s
–1
. The regional ocean circulation is 
dominated by a cyclonic circulation, the western 
extremity of the cyclonic subpolar gyre of the North 
Atlantic. The sea off the continental shelf is held ice 
free by an inflow of warm, saline waters from the 
subtropics. This collision of cold air and ice-free 
ocean leads to large upward heat flux, reaching  
700 W m
–2
 or more, with monthly averages in the 
range 200~300 W m
–2
. Combined wind and 
Sea ice, watermass and freshwater processes/Coastal lagoons 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  173 
buoyancy forcing uplifts isopycnals in the central 
Labrador Sea, reduces the stratification and makes 
the central waters susceptible to repeated deep 
convection.  
 
Another important characteristic of winter 
convection is an essentially instable oceanographic 
structure, with increasing instability by negative 
buoyancy flux at the sea surface, sustained by 
dynamic balance, with increasing cyclonic 
circulation spun up by increasing wind stress. Thus, 
winter convection is a transitory phenomenon only 
observable during a strong and cold wind event. 
When driving forces of convection weaken or stop, 
the pycnostad water, forming a ‘convection 
chimney’, will collapse down into the oceanographic 
structure with density stratification in hydrostatic 
balance. 
 
The process of winter deep convection forces us to 
revise the ordinary concept of ‘ventilation’ with an 
outcropping of isopycnals at the surface. With the 
exception of deep convection events, there remains a 
firm stratification with capping by the surface mixed 
layer. We cannot expect to capture the evidence of 
winter deep convection by making usual bimonthly 
or monthly ship observations, as winter deep 
convection can occur during monitoring breaks.  
 
During deep winter convection, cyclonic circulation 
and its enhancement by strong, cold, dry winter 
winds blowing off the surface capping layer, and 
source of the salinity supply, can be common 
preconditioning and driving factors for the winter 
convection, as summarized in Table 1. Thus, in order 
to identify the mechanism of pycnostad water 
formation in the eastern part of the Okhotsk Sea to be 
winter convection, the occurrences of these factors 
will be examined in the next section, and compared 
to the Gulf of Lions and Labrador Sea.  
 
Comparison of the Gulf of Lions and Labrador Sea, 
and with the Okhotsk Sea 
 
We must note that the winter convection in the Gulf 
of Lions and  the Labrador Sea is facilitated by the 
existence of higher salinity and higher temperature 
subsurface water, and with temperature maximum 
and salinity maximum or halostad, these are 
characteristics of tropical or subtropical waters. On 
the other hand, in the Okhotsk Sea the density 
stratification is mainly comprised from salinity 
stratification. Another difference is in the 
temperature of convection water, with potential 
temperature ranging from 12.8~12.95ºC in the Gulf 
of Lions (Schott et al., 1996) and 2.7~2.9ºC in the 
Labrador Sea (Lilly et al., 1999) compared to  
–1.0~2.0ºC in the Okhotsk Sea.  
 
Surface cooling will bend the head of T/S profiles 
downward to be aligned to isopycnals. Further 
cooling will shift them to the right (direction of 
salinity increase), as vertical mixing associated with 
convection produces mixed water of less saline and 
cold water surface water, and saline and warmer 
intermediate water. Colder air with stronger winds 
will deepen the convection depth. In the case of the 
Gulf of Lions or the Labrador Sea, this procedure can 
take place in a temperature domain far higher than 
the freezing point while in case of the Okhotsk Sea, 
as water temperature is ranging near zero, and 
density is determined mainly by salinity, freezing

can be easily reached. Therefore, for the winter 
convection to occur in the Okhotsk Sea, we need to 
consider the possible contribution of sea ice formation.  
 
Another characteristic of the convection region in the 
Okhotsk Sea is that it is connected to the pycnostad 
waters in the Kuril Straits and to shallow water on 
the shelf, where strong tidal mixing dominates. 
Therefore, we also need to examine the effects of 
tidal mixing.

Cyclonic circulation and strong winds 
 
As currents over the Okhotsk Sea are difficult to 
measure in winter, a map of general circulation is 
produced only for the warm season, as shown in 
Figure 15. In this figure, the general cyclonic 
circulation around the Okhotsk Sea can be 
recognized, traced by the major currents.

Figure 16 shows the surface, 5 and 100 m current 
vectors in the open water of the Okhotsk Sea in 
February (Fig. 16). The surface current vectors are 
directed southwest, indicating Ekman transport 
caused by strong northern winter monsoons. 
However, the current vectors for the 5 and 100 m 
layers are directed northward. Figure 17 displays the 
monthly mean transport of the East Sakhalin Current 
at 53ºN (Mizuta et al., 2003). Therefore, the 
observed currents in winter are a strong northward 
current (the West Kamchatka Current) in the eastern 
part and a strong southward current (the East 
Sakhalin Current) in the western part of the Okhotsk 
Sea, indicating the development of a cyclonic 
circulation by strong winter monsoons. The transport 
of the East Sakhalin Current has a sharp peak in 
January–February, indicating that the driving wind is 
strongest at this time of year (Fig. 17).

Sea is covered by sea ice at the time of historical sea 
ice extent. 
 
Ice potential analysis 
 
For winter convection to reach a specific depth 
penetrating shallow stratification of surface capping, 
the density of the surface water must become equal 
to the density of water at that specific depth, through 
an increase of density by a decrease of temperature 
through cooling, and/or by an increase of salinity 
through the entrainment of saltier water laterally or 
vertically, as shown in the cases of the Gulf of Lions 
and the Labrador Sea. However, in the case of the 
subarctic Pacific, as density stratification is mainly 
determined by salinity stratification, simple cooling 
cannot cause density inversion and automatically 
deepen the cooling convection as in the subtropical 
waters or waters under the influence of subtropical 
water. Therefore, salinity increase through brine 
concentration during ice formation is an important 
driving factor for winter convection to reach deeper 
depths.

Sea ice, water mass and freshwater processes/Coastal lagoons 
176 PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
Zubov (1945) coined the term ‘ice potential’, the 
amount of heat to be transferred from the water 
surface to air, necessary for convection to reach a 
specific depth ‘without ice formation’ in an effort to 
answer the questions “When will sea ice be formed?” 
and “How much heat is needed to be transferred 
from the water column to air before sea ice can 
form?” Terms needed to compute the ice potential 
include thickness of ice to be formed for convection 
to reach a specific depth, and the heat necessary to be 
transferred from sea. Thus, the ice potential 
calculation can be a useful diagnostic tool to 
determine winter convection in the first order 
approximation. 
 
For calculation, the density of seawater is assumed 
equal to 1.00; density of sea ice is assumed equal to 
0.90; salinity of sea ice is assumed 0; and latent heat 
of sea ice is equal to 335 kJ    kg
–1
 (= 80 cal    g
–1
). 
Results for the January ice potential at 52.5ºN, 
following the method of Zubov (1945) introduced by 
Tabata (1977), are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2 
shows the thickness of ice to be formed in order for 
convection to reach different depths for various 
stations. At the stations east of 149.5ºE, ice does not 
need to be formed by cooling for convection to reach 
as far down as 300 m. For stations in the western part 
of the section, ice some 10s of centimeters thick need 
to be formed by cooling in order for convection to 
reach beyond 100 m depth.

Important features of Tables 2 and 3 are that a 
reduction in heat transfer of 3 × 10
3
 MJ    m
–2
 can 
deepen the pycnostad water down to 400 m, with a 
total ice production of 30 cm. With the help of wind 
forcing creating anti-cyclonic circulation in the 
blowing off of the surface mixed layer, the necessary 
heat flux from the surface by cooling will be largely 
reduced. For validation of this possibility, estimates 
of heat flux at severe cooling events are needed.  
 
Note the fact that although sea ice does not exist on 
the pycnostad water, it should not be understood as 
evidence for the disproof of the ice potential 
calculation. During a deep convection event, newly 
formed frazil ice and the surface mixed layer are to 
be blown off from the convection region but denser 
water produced by ejected brine can form a 
downwelling plume to drive convection.  
Contribution of tidal mixing to winter convection 
 
The unique feature of winter convection in the 
eastern part of the Okhotsk Sea is that the convection 
region is connected to the tidally mixed waters on the 
shallow coastal shelf and in the Kuril Straits. As the 
strong tidal current prevails in the coastal shelf from 
the west coast of Kamchatka through Shelikov Bay 
to the northern coast of the Okhotsk Sea, and in the 
Kuril Straits, vertically mixed water can be 
distributed around these areas and be advected along 
horizontal circulation.  However, since the pycnostad 
water and convection with ice formation can only be 
observed in January, tidal mixing cannot be the 
major driving factor in the formation of pycnostad 
water and winter convection.

Conclusion  
 
Judging from the factors preconditioning and driving 
deep convection (Table 1), the pycnostad water in 
the eastern part of the Okhotsk Sea can be seen as 
evidence of ongoing winter convection.  The wind 
stress of strong northerly winter monsoons over the 
Okhotsk Sea drives the cyclonic circulation of the 
sea, including the East Sakhalin Current and the 
West Kamchatka Current, and accumulates and piles 
up the surface water and drift ice to the western side 
of the sea.  This may be a possible mechanism for 
maintaining the open ocean polynya in the eastern 
half of the Okhotsk Sea.  
 
The volume of water increased as the result of deep 
convection is the water having a σ
0
 range of 
26.75~27.1, which corresponds to the density of 
Okhotsk Sea Mode Water for the inside of the 
Okhotsk Sea, and to that of intermediate layer of 
Oyashio Water for the outside of the Okhotsk Sea. 
Thus, stronger and/or longer winter convection will 
produce a larger volume of Okhotsk Mode Water or 
water of the intermediate layer of Oyashio Water, 
which can make the intermediate layer of Oyashio 
Water colder and less saline.  This suggests that the 
extent of decreased sea ice accompanied by global 
warming can bring a colder and less saline 
intermediate layer of Oyashio Water into the 
Okhotsk Sea. 
 
In considering the results of winter convection on 
watermass formation and modification in the eastern 
part of the Okhotsk Sea, we note that the water mass 
formed by winter convection: 
1) is not a homogeneous water mass that can be 
represented by single water type, but a group of 
pycnostad water types with different T/S value 
pairs for different depths and with different 
horizontal density trends;  
2) has a relatively large spatial extent, with a range 
of 10ºN × 3ºE (ca. 1000 km × 300 km), 
comparable or larger than that of the Labrador 
Sea or Gulf of Lions.  
 
Thus, the water mass produced by winter convection 
at the open ocean polynya of the Okhotsk Sea will 
cause considerable interannual variability in 
temperature and salinity of the intermediate layer in 
response to the interannual variability of the winter 
climate in the region. 
 
Kasai et al.’s (1997, 2007) analysis of the A-line 
dataset shows the enhancement of primary 
productivity in the Oyashio region after the 1998 
regime shift, and the increased density gradient in 
the euphotic zone by increased temperature and/or 
lowered salinity in the surface layer can be the 
possible environmental conditions causing 
enhancement of primary production. The present 
study suggests that winter deep convection can be 
one of the physical processes causing these changes.  
 
Subjects for future studies 
 
This is a preliminary study, as analyses are limited to 
winter and at the stations of pycnostad sites. The 
deep convection resulting from cooling at the sea 
surface persists only for a period of a few days but 
occurs over regions of horizontal extent of order of 
100 km (Thorpe, 2005). However, depending on its 
spatial scale, the resultant effect on water mass 
formation is not negligible, although the temporal 
nature of the phenomenon makes winter deep 
convection seem like a trivial transient event and 
hides its existence from synoptic features. Thus, it is 
a marvel that the WOA05 contains a fine shot of 
winter deep convection in the Okhotsk Sea.  
 
Furthermore, as primitive equations used in general 
circulation models exclude convection with vertical 
acceleration, diagnosing or interpreting winter 
convection by ordinary general circulation models 
based on the premise of a hydrostatic ocean, are 
basically difficult. Thus, the development of a 
combined atmosphere–sea ice–ocean model that 
allows winter deep convection is necessary for 
assessing the effects of winter deep convection on 
climate variability associated with global warming.  
 
The following items are subjects for study of the 
Okhotsk Sea to be performed in near future under 
international collaboration such as the PICES 
FUTURE (Forecasting and Understanding Trends, 
Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific Marine 
Ecosystems) program:  
1) The necessary preconditioning for winter 
convection, including possible maximum heat 
transfer from sea to air during cooling events; 
2) The time change in temperature and salinity, 
including the effect of inflowing East 
Kamchatka Water;  
3) The process of mixing and transport of ejected 
brine at ice formation sites on the shelf;  
Sea ice, watermass and freshwater processes/Coastal lagoons 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  179 
4) The freshwater supply  to open water by stray 
drift ice;  
5) The effects of tidal mixing and internal tides on 
the formation of pycnostad water;  
6) The response of the convection process to 
interannual climate variability. 
 
A full elucidation of the winter convection process 
needs to be addressed in field process studies, 
including the use of pop-up floats, modeling studies, 
and historical data analyses.

Influence of Amur River discharge on hydrological conditions of the 
Amurskiy Liman and Sakhalin Bay of the Sea of Okhotsk during a 
spring–summer flood

Introduction 
 
The Amur River is one of the largest rivers of the 
world.  Its length is 4350 km and its total discharge is 
about 390 km
3
 from a river basin of 1,855,000 km
2
. 
The regime of the Amur River is distinguished by the 
spring–summer flood, summer low water, summer–
fall flood, and winter low water.  The spring flood is 
caused by melting snow and the summer–fall flood is 
caused by monsoon rains in the river basin.  About 
87% of the annual discharge falls during the warm 
part of year (May–October). 
 
The Amur River flows into the Amurskiy Liman 
which is a narrow and shallow strait connecting the 
Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk.  The Amurskiy 
Liman can also be considered as an estuary of the 
Amur River within which are several navigation 
channels.  The Sakhalin and the Southern navigation 
channels connect the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of 
Japan, and from the Amur River mouth the 
Nevelskoy (Northern), the Southern and the East 
navigation channels (Petrov, 1959) exit. The 
Nevelskoy Strait connects the Amurskiy Liman to the 
Tatar Strait (Sea of Japan). 
 
The dynamic conditions of the Amurskiy Liman are 
formed under the influence of the Amur River 
discharge, the ratio of background sea levels between 
the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk, strong tidal 
currents and mixing.  As a result of the monsoon 
character of the atmospheric circulation, southern 
winds prevail over the Amurskiy Liman in the 
summer and northern ones in the winter. 
 
On the northern border of the Amurskiy Liman in the 
summer, the background level of water falls, and in 
the winter it rises; on the southern border of the 
Liman the sea level fluctuations occur in the opposite 
manner.  Thus, during the warm period of the year 
(May–October), the difference in background levels 
between the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk is 
positive (northward inclination). Due to this 
difference in sea levels, estuarine circulation is 
formed, and in the summer, the mean current is 
directed to the north.  The data on sea level changes 
during the winter period are inconsistent.  Some 
researchers (Lobanova, 1987) state that the 
difference in the levels during the winter period 
becomes negative (southward inclination) and the 
current is directed mainly to the south (into the Sea 
of Japan).  Other data (Chao and Boicourt, 1986) 
suggest that the difference of the background levels 
is close to zero in the winter which should lead to the 
uniform distribution of the Amur River discharge 
between the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk. 
Considering the available data on seasonal changes 
of the difference in the background sea levels and the 
variability of the Amur River discharge 
(Glukhovskiy et al., 1998), it is possible to roughly 
estimate the volume of freshwater inflow into the 
Okhotsk Sea and the Sea of Japan during a year 
under average conditions.  During the period from 
May till October, all river discharge is directed 
towards the Sea of Okhotsk.  During this period the 
average discharge is equal to 331 km
3
.  If, during the 
cold period of the year (November–April), the 
discharge is uniformly distributed between the seas, 
about 6.5% of the Amur River annual discharge 
(31.5 km
3
) is directed towards the Sea of Japan. 
Thus, on average, the Sea of Okhotsk receives 362.5 
km
3
 of fresh water within a year.  
 
In the Amurskiy Liman two structural zones divided 
by a front have been determined (Lobanova, 1987; 
Zhabin et al., 2007).  The northern zone is associated 
with the mouth of the Amur River, the Sakhalin 
channel and the Nevelskoy channel, and the southern 
zone with the Southern channel and the Nevelskoy 
Strait.  The northern part of the estuary is stratified 
under the influence of the river discharge.  The 
southern zone is characterized by a homogeneous 
vertical distribution of oceanographic parameters.  In 
the warm part of the year the waters of low salinity 
flow from the Amurskiy Liman to the Sakhalin Bay 
(the Sea of Okhotsk) and form the Amur River plume

A study of the Amur River mouth ecosystem was 
carried out during a cruise of the R/V Professor 
Gagarinskiy in June, 2007. Oceanographic 
measurements were conducted with the CTD-probe 
SBE 19plus.  The location of hydrological stations for 
this study is shown in Figure 1.

MODIS) allow us to investigate the structure and 
dynamics of the waters near the Amur River mouth 
during the spring–summer flood.  
 
Oceanographic structure near the Amur River 
mouth 
 
At the mouth of the Amur River, the mixing of 
seawater and river water occurs.  The area around the 
mouth includes the Amurskiy Liman and the adjoining 
parts of Sakhalin Bay and the Tatar Strait.  
 
Looking at the section through the Amurskiy Liman 
(Fig. 2), bounded by the Southern and the Sakhalin 
channels, there are two distinguished structural zones 
– a mixed zone and a stratified one. The southern zone 
has a typical homogeneous vertical distribution of 
hydrographical characteristics with high salinity; the 
northern one has a two-layered structure with water of 
very low salinity in the surface layer. The stratification 
in the northern part of the estuary is supported both by 
the flow into the near-bottom layer of the Sea of 
Okhotsk (a salt wedge on the northern outlet of the 
Liman), and by the near-bottom advection of saltier 
waters from the Sea of Japan (the stratified regime 
near the river mouth). The stratification in the northern 
part of the estuary is essentially weakened in the zone 
that is under direct influence of the river discharge. 
 
The southern part of the Amurskiy Liman is filled by 
the waters flowing from the Sea of Japan. Intensive 
tidal and wind mixing in this zone leads to a homo- 
geneous vertical distribution of oceanographical 
characteristics.  The influence of the river discharge 
on this part of the Amurskiy Liman is insignificant. 
The salinity in the mixed zone increases in the 
direction to the southern outlet from the estuary.  The 
distribution of temperature and salinity in the section 
across the Amur River plume in Sakhalin Bay is 
shown in Figure 3. 
Low salinity and warm waters flow from the 
Amurskiy Liman to Sakhalin Bay through the 
northern outlet of the Liman.  The plume is about 7 m 
thick, the salinity in the plume ranges from 7 to 15 
psu, and temperature ranges from 7 to 12° С.  A sharp 
pycnocline separates the plume from very cold  
(< –1.5° С) and salty (> 32 psu) bottom shelf waters 
of the Sea of Okhotsk.  Higher values of temperature 
and smaller values of salinity are observed in the 
discharge current.

Two cross-sections were obtained for the Tatar Strait. 
On the southern section a two-layer vertical structure 
of waters was observed (Fig. 4).  
 
The upper layer was about 10 m thick and was 
separated from the bottom water layers by a sharp 
thermohalocline.  The surface layer near the coast of 
the continent was characterized by low values of 
temperature (about 5° С) and high values of salinity  
(> 30). In the middle part of the Tatar Strait and near 
Sakhalin Island, waters with lower salinity (< 28.5) 
and higher surface temperatures (6–8° С) were 
observed.  The origin of this zone of low salinity could 
have been caused by the discharge of the waters from 
the southern part of the Amurskiy Liman through the 
Nevelskoy Strait in the period preceding the 
observation.  
 
A second cross-section of the observation (Fig. 1) was 
executed near the southern inlet of the Nevelskoy 
Strait.  The vertical thermohaline structure in this 
section differed from the structure of waters of the 
northern part of the Tatar Strait.  At the inlet to the 
strait a more homogeneous vertical distribution of 
hydrological characteristics was observed. The 
temperature monotonically decreased and the salinity 
increased with depth.  The waters in the central part of 
the section were completely mixed from the surface to 
the bottom.  The salinity of the surface layer did not 
exceed 28.5 and the temperature changed within the 
range of 7–9° С.  The waters of low salinity at the 
outlet from the Amurskiy Liman demonstrate the 
influence of the Amur discharge in the northern part of 
the Tatar Strait during the spring–summer flood. 
 
The Amur River discharge from satellite 
observations 
 
The Amur River discharge contains a significant 
amount of sediments.  This allows us to see contrasts 
in turbidity from remote sensing in order to study the 
Amur River discharge distribution in the shelf zone of 
the Sea of Okhotsk.  Figure 5 shows a visible satellite 
image of Sakhalin Bay, acquired during the survey 
period (June 7, 2007).  It can be seen that turbid 
waters fill the northern part of the Amurskiy Liman 
and through the northern outlet outflow to Sakhalin 
Bay. Two structural elements are distinguished: a 
discharge lens with a jet current (bulge) and the 
coastal Amur current.  The discharge lens is filled by 
the inflow of more turbidity (warm and low salinity) 
waters. The coastal Amur current is observed near the 
Sakhalin coast of Sakhalin Bay. 
 
A map of current vector speeds, calculated by the 
displacement of markers (drifting ice floes and other 
characteristic points), is superimposed on a pair of 
images taken from the Aqua and Terra satellites on 
June, 7, 2007 with a 100-min time difference (Fig. 5).

2007) illustrating the plume bulge formation as the Amur 
River plume exits the estuary. The overlaid current vectors 
identify the recirculation zone within the bulge. 
 
The images show that the Amur River discharge, 
while leaving the estuary, forms an anticyclonic 
circulation on the periphery of the plume. The 
recirculation provides the inflow of low salinity waters 
to the internal field of the plume.  The current speeds 
in the discharge current leaving the estuary reach 
1 km/s.  The speed ranges between 0.4 to 1.5 km/s in 
the jet current passing along the periphery of the lens.   
 
Dynamics of the Amur River discharge 
 
The river discharge in the shelf zone forms bulge and 
coastal density currents. Garvin (1995) offers a 
dynamical system for classifying buoyant discharges. 
The key parameter of this classification is the Kelvin 
number which is defined as the relation of the coastal 
current scale L to the baroclinic Rossby
 
deformation 
radius L
D
.  The deformation
 
radius is L
D
 = c/f = (g'h) 
0.5/f, where f is the Coriolis parameter, с is the phase 
velocity of long interfacial waves, h is the plume 
thickness, g' = g
 
( ρ
2 
– ρ
1
) / ρ
2
, is the reduced gravity (g 
is gravitational acceleration, ρ
1
 and ρ
2
 are densities of 
the upper and the lower layers, respectively). One 
more important parameter used in this classification is 
the non-dimensional densimetric Froude number F = 
U/c, where U is a characteristic velocity within the 
coastal current. It is known that at F > 1 the current 
will be “rough” (supercritical regime), and at F < 1 it 
will be quiet (a subcritical regime). At the transition 
from a supercritical movement regime to a subcritical 
one (F = 1, critical Froude number) an internal 
hydraulic jump is observed which is accompanied by 
energy dissipation and mixing. 
 
The Kelvin number can be used to compare the 
contributions of inertial and rotary effects in the 
dynamics of the discharge current near the outlet from 
the Liman. In the limiting case when K << 1, the 
influence of the Coriolis effect on the distribution of 
river discharge waters is insignificant. In this case the 
dynamic regime near the mouth or the outlet from the 
Liman is determined by the advection of low salinity 
waters. At greater Kelvin numbers (>> 1) the 
dynamics of the current outflow from the Liman 
(mouth) is defined by rotation of the Earth.  
 
The dynamic classification is diagnostic and requires 
preliminary data on the parameters and scales of the 
phenomenon, such as stratification, characteristic 
speed of the stream and the scale of current. 
Estimations of these parameters for the discharge of 
the Amur River to the Sea of Okhotsk are received 
through oceanographic and satellite observations. The 
discharge current is characterized by the difference in 
density of ρ
2 
– ρ
1
 = 20 kg/m
3
, and the average 
thickness of the plume is 7 m. The scale of the current 
according to satellite data is equal to approximately 
20 km. The scale of the current coincides with the 
width of the northern outlet from the Liman. The 
Coriolis parameter at the latitude of Sakhalin Bay is 
equal to 1.15 × 10
–4
 s
–1
. At the observed values of the 
parameters, the baroclinic radius of deformation is 
10 km which gives K = 2. This estimation shows that 
the dynamics of the Amur River discharge depends on 
the effects of rotation. 
 
The estimation of the speed the outflow of low salinity 
waters from the Liman to the Sea of Okhotsk (the area 
of the section at the outlet is 105 m
2
) can be 
determined by the average value of the Amur River 
discharge in June (166,000 m
3
/s) (Glukhovskiy et al., 
1998). The salinity at the outlet from the Liman was 
10 psu. Therefore, when making the calculations, it is 
supposed that the Amurskiy Liman river waters 
(salinity ~0) mix with the waters of the Sea of Japan 
(salinity 30 psu) in the ratio of 1:2. In this case, the 
average speed equals 0.5 km/s which gives F = 0.4. 
The estimation of the discharge current speed during 
the study can be determined with the help of satellite 
observations, using the method of sea markers. For 
Sea ice, water mass and freshwater processes/Coastal lagoons 
184 PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
this purpose, the displacement of characteristic points 
on consecutive images (time interval is 100 minutes), 
received on June 5, 7, 8 and 15, 2007 from the 
satellites Terra and Aqua were calculated. According 
to the satellite data, the average current speed at the 
outlet from the Liman is 0.85 km/s which gives F = 
0.7. At such values of Froude numbers the regime of 
movement will be subcritical and the river discharge 
should extend as a superficial current above the layer 
of denser surrounding waters. 
 
Thus, the calculation of nondimensional parameters 
shows that the contribution of the effect of the Earth’s 
rotation to the dynamics of the discharge current of the 
Amur River exceeds the contribution of inertial 
effects. The numerical models of coastal circulation 
(James, 1997) show that at K ~ 1 near the river mouth 
two zones with various dynamics are formed – a bulge 
with an anticyclonic circulation and a density coastal 
current. The scale of this current is equal to the 
baroclinic Rossby deformation radius. A more 
complex dynamic regime with a steady anticyclonic 
circulation in the lens is formed in the bay which is 
under the influence of intensive river discharge. 
 
Conclusion 
 
In the estuary of the Amur River occurs mixing of 
river and sea waters which flow into the Amurskiy 
Liman from the Sea of Japan. The waters of low 
salinity flow into the Sea of Okhotsk in the form of a 
discharge current. Under the influence of the Earth’s 
rotation the discharge current deviates to the right and 
forms an anticyclonic circulation in Sakhalin Bay. The 
mesoscale Amur River plume is formed and filled 
 
during a spring–summer flood. Further research on the 
dynamics, conditions of formation, and evolution of 
the plume is necessary.

Abstract 
 
Using reanalysis data, we investigate the relationship of Amur River discharge and vertically integrated 
atmospheric horizontal moisture flux.  The discharge has two peaks, one in spring and the other in autumn.  A 
northward flux associated with storms in the previous autumn and winter contributes to the spring discharge. 
The autumn discharge is supplied by a northward flux associated with the Asian summer monsoon and by an 
eastward flux originating from evaporation in Eurasia. Interannual variation is also investigated.  The strong 
summer monsoon strengthens the summer flux convergence, resulting in anomalously large discharge in 
autumn.  The strong winter monsoon wind with a dry air mass activates evaporation.  The anomalously large 
spring discharge is related to the warm phase of the Arctic Oscillation.  These results indicate that the monsoon 
plays an important role in the freshening of the Okhotsk Sea.

Introduction  
 
The Amur River, with a basin area of 1.86 × 10
6
 km
2
, 
is the fourth largest river in northern Eurasia and 
supplies much of the fresh water to the Okhotsk Sea, 
one of the southernmost ice-covered seas in the 
Northern Hemisphere. Freshwater discharge from the 
Amur River, which causes large stratification that 
suppresses deep convection and promotes freezing, is 
an important factor controlling the formation of sea 
ice in the Okhotsk Sea.  
  
According to Ogi et al. (2001), the annual amount of 
discharge from the Amur River is 333 km
3
/year 
(10,929 m
3
/s). A distinctive characteristic of the 
seasonal cycle of the Amur River is its two discharge 
peaks, one in June and the other in September 
(Fig. 1a). The Amur River is the only river in 
northern Eurasia to have double discharge peaks 
(Masuda, 2007, pers. comm.). Ogi et al. (2001) 
speculated that the first peak occurs due to melting 
snowpack and frozen soil, whereas the second peak 
is caused by summertime monsoon precipitation.  
Past studies have commonly applied vertically 
integrated horizontal moisture flux analysis, using 
reanalysis and river discharge data, to rivers flowing 
toward the Arctic. This method might indicate the 
origins of the moisture that becomes river discharge. 
According to a tagged water experiment using an 
atmospheric general circulation model simulation by 
Numaguti (1999), the summer precipitation in 
northern Eurasia originates partially from water 
vapor that evaporates from inland areas of the 
Eurasian continent. However, because of the lack of 
detailed study of the moisture flux associated with 
the Amur River, the moisture source remains 
unclear.  
 
Few papers have described the interannual variability 
of the Amur River. Ogi and Tachibana (2006) found 
that the interannual variation in the Amur River 
discharge is related to the annual mean Northern 
Hemisphere Annular Mode/Arctic Oscillation 
(NAM/AO).  However, because there are two peaks 
in the discharge, the large-scale atmospheric patterns 
and local-scale storm tracks governing the spring

discharge peak must differ from those governing the 
autumn peak.  However, no previous studies have 
clarified the large-scale atmospheric patterns and 
local-scale storm tracks that determine individual 
discharge peaks. 
 
The purpose of this study is to determine which 
atmospheric patterns govern the spring and autumn 
discharge peaks.  We will illustrate the origin of the 
moisture. Moreover, we will determine the 
interannual variations in the atmospheric patterns 
that influence the two discharge peaks.   
  
Data and Methods  
 
Monthly mean Amur River discharge data from 1980 
through 2001 are used for the analysis.  These data 
were recorded at Bogorodskoe, the lowest-reach 
hydrological station of the Amur River at which 
discharge has been routinely measured by the Far 
Eastern branch of the Russian Federal Service for 
Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring 
(FERFSHEM).   
Data from the European Centre for Medium-Range 
Weather Forecasting is used to perform a 40-year 
reanalysis (ERA40) (Uppala et al., 2005). The time 
resolution of the data is 6 hourly. The horizontal 
resolution is 2.5° latitude × 2.5° longitude. The 
analysis period is from 1979 through 2001.  
 
We estimated the net precipitation (precipitation 
minus evaporation, P – E) over the Amur River basin 
from moisture flux. P – E is estimated using the 
atmospheric moisture budget equation as follows: 
  
 ,
PW
EP q
t
∂
= −∇ + −
∂
v (1) 
 
where PW is precipitable water, q is the specific 
humidity, v is the wind vector, and <qv> represents 
the vertically integrated horizontal moisture flux. P – 
E is estimated from the area-weighted average values 
of PW and the horizontal convergence of <qv> over 
the area of the Amur River basin (Fig. 2).  
 
Water vapor in the mid-latitudes is transported by 
both atmospheric stationary waves and moving 
transient eddies. Because the temporal scales of these 
two transports are quite different, dividing the 
moisture flux into these two categories provides 
useful information on the atmospheric causes of the 
discharge (Oshima and Yamazaki, 2006). We divide 
the monthly mean total moisture flux into stationary 
flux and transient flux as follows:  
 
 ,
q qq q
==+ ′′ v vv v (2) 
 
where the overbars represent the monthly average, 
and the primes represent the deviation from the 
monthly average. The stationary flux is calculated 
from the monthly mean fields of wind, moisture, and 
surface pressure. The transient flux is obtained by 
subtracting the stationary flux from the total flux.  
 
The connectivity of the P – E and the river discharge 
R is described using the terrestrial water budget 
equation. The time rate of change in land water 
storage S is written as:  
 
 ,

where R is the river runoff. Thus, R is determined by   
∂S/∂t and P – E.

Comparison of Discharge with Net Precipitation  
 
Seasonal cycle of discharge and net precipitation  
 
We compared the Amur River discharge with the  
P – E estimated by the ERA40. The annual mean  
P – E (182 mm/year) is close to the observed annual 
discharge (190 mm/year). The seasonal means and 
the interannual variation of P – E are also close to 
those of the discharge, as will be shown later.  
 
As discussed earlier, the river discharge has two 
discharge peaks, in June and September, while a 
single peak in P – E occurs in July that is 
approximately 2 months later than discharge in 
autumn. This time lag of the autumn discharge peak 
behind the P – E peak is related to the fact that runoff 
takes approximately 2 months to reach the outlet of 
the basin, given the massive size of the Amur River 
basin. Figure 1b shows several climatological 
conditions over the Amur River basin. The 
temperature at 2 m height changes from negative to 
positive in April and back to negative in October. 
This indicates that precipitation accumulates as snow 
from October to March and that the accumulated 
snow and frozen soil start to melt in April. The river 
water temperature has a seasonal cycle similar to that 
of temperature at 2 m height. The river water 
temperature becomes positive in May, indicating that 
frozen river water begins to melt in this month. The 
river water temperature falls to zero in November, 
and the river starts to freeze. Satellite observations 
indicate maximum snow coverage in January, a large 
decline beginning in April, and accumulation starting 
again in October. This suggests that snowmelt starts 
in April and that the discharge peaks in May to June 
with the decrease in storage.   
 
To compare the discharge with moisture flux and 
atmospheric patterns in association with the two 
discharge peaks, we first confirm the months of P – 
E that cause the respective spring and autumn 
discharge. Based on the two clear discharge peaks, 
we define December through June as the months of 
Sea ice, water mass and freshwater processes/Coastal lagoons 
188 PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
spring discharge and July through November as the 
months of autumn discharge (Fig. 1a). We 
determined the periods of summer P – E and winter 
P – E that correspond to the spring and autumn 
discharge, respectively. From a procedure for the 
definition of the period in Tachibana et al. (2008), 
the time averaged P – E from May through August 
(summer P – E) corresponds to the autumn 
discharge, and that from September through April 
(winter P – E) corresponds to the spring discharge 
(Fig. 1a). The summer P – E (113) and winter P – E 
(69) closely agree with the spring discharge 
(121 mm/year) and autumn discharge (69 mm/year), 
respectively.  
 
Moisture flux patterns in association with 
summer P – E and winter P – E  
 
We compare the seasonal cycles of the moisture flux 
convergence and the P – E over the Amur basin 
(Figure not shown).  The seasonal P – E cycle is 
similar to that of the moisture flux convergence, 
except in spring and autumn due to the large changes 
of PW (Fig. 1b). The stationary component of the 
moisture flux convergence is dominant in summer. 
Therefore, the moisture is transported mainly by 
stationary waves. In the winter, the transient 
component of the moisture flux convergence is 
positive and plays a principal role in supplying the 
water vapor in the Amur basin, while the stationary 
component is negative.   
 
These characteristics are shown in the moisture flux 
fields associated with the summer P – E and winter  
P – E (Fig. 2).  In summer, the northeastward flux of 
the stationary component mainly determines the total 
flux convergence.  The flux from the East China Sea 
to Japan indicates the rain belt that coincides with the 
Baiu/Meiyu stationary front, in association with the 
Asian summer monsoon.  Therefore, the summer 
flux is partially influenced by the Asian summer 
monsoon.  The eastward flux from the west of the 
basin, which can be caused by mid-latitude 
westerlies, also contributes to the precipitation. 
Divergent areas are located in the far western inland 
area of the continent. Because the divergent area 
indicates that surface evaporation exceeds 
precipitation, the figure implies that water vapor 
which evaporates from inland areas also supplies 
precipitation to the Amur basin. This is consistent 
with a model study by Numaguti (1999).  
 
In winter, the flux by the transient component 
converges over the Amur basin, whereas the flux by 
the stationary component diverges. The flux 
convergence of the transient component can be 
caused by storm activity in this season and region, 
where wintertime cyclones are known to begin and 
develop. The fluxes of the transient component 
suggest that the river water in the spring discharge 
originates from the Pacific, although these arrows are 
not the same as the material trajectories. In contrast, 
the fluxes of the stationary component around the 
Amur basin point southeastward. This direction is 
associated with the winter monsoon that blows from  
the cold, dry Eurasian continent toward the warm 
Pacific Ocean. Evaporation due to the stationary 
component associated with the dry monsoon wind 
over the Amur basin can cause the moisture flux 
divergence. Overall, the total flux in winter slightly 
converges over the Amur basin because of a larger 
moisture flux from the south by the transient 
component rather than by the stationary component. 
  
Interannual Variation of Discharge  
 
Interannual variation and its relationship to 
horizontal moisture flux patterns  
 
Next, we investigate the causes of interannual 
variation in Amur River discharge. We compared the 
time series of spring and autumn discharge and their 
associated winter and summer P – E, respectively. 
Correlation coefficients are 0.84 for autumn 
discharge and summer P – E, and 0.57 for spring 
discharge and winter P – E. The large correlation for 
autumn discharge indicates that summer atmospheric 
processes principally govern autumn discharge. On 
the other hand, spring discharge is influenced not 
only by atmospheric processes related to the P – E, 
but also by other hydrological processes that are 
affected by variation in water storage S.   
  
The variations in the total moisture flux convergence 
correlate well with the stationary components in both 
seasons. Thus, the stationary components are the 
prime determinant for the interannual variation in 
discharge. Now, we examine the stationary moisture 
flux in association with the interannual variation in 
spring and autumn discharge (winter and summer  
P – E).  Figure 3 shows the composite maps of the 
stationary moisture fluxes in years of large (top 5) 
and small (bottom 5) summer P – E. Moisture flux 
fields in the top 5 years show counterclockwise 
circulation centered in the west of the basin. This 
indicates that the moisture tends to come from the 
Pacific to the southeastern Amur basin. In contrast, 
the flux in the bottom 5 years is more zonal than in 
Sea ice, watermass and freshwater processes/Coastal lagoons

the top 5 years. The source region of the water in the 
bottom 5 years is thus mainly in inland continental 
areas. Figure 3 also shows the flux difference 
between the top 5 and bottom 5 years. A 
counterclockwise anomalous moisture flux pattern is 
obvious, suggesting that anomalous moisture flux 
from Southeast Asia also promotes anomalous P – E 
in the Amur basin, which then leads to anomalous 
autumn discharge.  
 
In winter, on the other hand, the differences in the 
flux fields between the top 5 and bottom 5 years 
exhibit a counterclockwise circulation pattern 
centered to the west of the Amur basin (Figure not 
shown). The counterclockwise pattern and the 
overall northward orientation in the Amur basin 
suggest the weakness of the Asian winter monsoon. 
 
Interannual variation and its relationship to 
large-scale atmospheric patterns  
 
Large-scale atmospheric fields linearly regressed 
onto the interannual variation in the stationary 
component of the moisture flux convergence show 
that a notable feature in the circum-Amur basin area 
in summer is the presence of negative anomalies over 
the west of the basin (near Lake Baikal) in the sea 
level pressure (SLP), 500-hPa, and 200-hPa height 
fields, signifying a barotropic structure. Cold 
anomalies can be also seen around Lake Baikal 
(Figure not shown). The location of the cyclonic 
circulation anomaly in association with the cold 
anomalies is located just to the west of the Amur 
basin. This cyclonic circulation agrees with the 
counterclockwise moisture flux pattern of the 
stationary component in the years of large summer  
P – E (Fig. 3). Also, positive anomalies over the 
Okhotsk Sea can be seen in the SLP field. These 
anomalies are related to the appearance of the 
Okhotsk High. The contrast between the anomalous 
low pressure over land and the anomalous high 
pressure over the Okhotsk Sea brings about a 
northward moisture flux in association with 
northward wind anomalies in the lower troposphere 
over the Amur basin. This northward wind can then 
supply the Amur basin with moisture in association 
with the strengthened Asian summer monsoon. A 
west-to-east wavy pattern crossing the Eurasian 
continent at approximately 40° N, along the core of a 
subtropical westerly jet, is clearly visible at 200-hPa 
height. This wave train is possibly a stationary 
Rossby wave that originated over western Europe. 
The cyclonic circulation around Lake Baikal, which 
Sea ice, water mass and freshwater processes/Coastal lagoons 
190 PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
directly influences the discharge, is thus related to 
this hemispheric mid-latitude circulation.  
 
Winter atmospheric patterns associated with the 
winter flux of the stationary component have a 
continent-to-ocean contrast in the SLP field similar 
to that in summer. Significant positive SLP 
anomalies widely cover the Okhotsk and Bering seas, 
signifying the weakness of the Aleutian Low. Also, 
over Lake Baikal, significant negative anomalies 
appear in the SLP field. This feature implies a 
weakness of the winter Siberian High. Weakness of 
both the Siberian High and Aleutian Low causes 
weakening of the Asian winter monsoon, which 
usually blows from the continent to the Pacific. This 
atmospheric pattern is consistent with the moisture 
flux pattern in winter. The weak winter monsoon 
wind over the Amur basin can suppress the 
evaporation there. For this reason, the moisture flux 
divergence over the basin in the top 5 years can be 
weaker than in the bottom 5 years.  
 
In addition, a hemispheric-scale pattern shows 
negative anomalies in the Arctic and positive 
anomalies in mid-latitudes from the surface to the 
upper troposphere at 200-hPa height, although 
statistical significance is low. These anomaly 
patterns are similar to the pattern of the positive 
phase of NAM/AO. This indicates that the NAM/AO 
pattern tends to be positive in winter with the large 
moisture flux. The positive phase of the NAM/AO is 
related to the weakened eastern Asian winter 
monsoon. Therefore, the relationship between this 
large moisture flux and the positive phase of 
NAM/AO is consistent with previous studies.  
  
Summary  
 
Using long-term discharge data to analyze horizontal 
moisture flux, we have uncovered processes that 
determine Amur River discharge and their seasonal 
and interannual variations. Comparison of the 
moisture flux with the discharge showed that the 
spring discharge, which peaks in June, is supplied by 
the moisture flux in the previous autumn and winter. 
The spring discharge is supplied mainly by short-
lived storm activity from the previous autumn and 
winter. On the other hand, the autumn discharge peak 
is supplied by the summertime moisture flux. The 
autumn discharge is supplied mainly by stationary 
atmospheric patterns in association with the Asian 
summer monsoon and mid-latitude westerlies.  
 
Interannual variation in the summer moisture flux is 
related to the strength of the Asian summer monsoon 
and a stationary anticyclone, the Okhotsk High.  The 
Asian summer monsoon, in association with 
anomalous cyclonic circulation over Eurasia, 
strengthens the anomalously large summer moisture 
flux from the south, resulting in anomalously large 
discharge in autumn.  The Asian winter monsoon, in 
association with the anomalously strong Siberian 
High and Aleutian Low, strengthens the moisture 
flux divergence (i.e., activated evaporation in the 
Amur basin, resulting in anomalously small 
discharge in spring).  The hemispheric atmospheric 
pattern relates to the moisture flux convergence and, 
to some extent, resembles the NAM/AO. 
Anomalously large spring discharge is also related to 
the warm phase of the NAM/AO, which prompts the 
melting of snow and frozen soil and thus contributes 
to the anomalously large spring discharge. Therefore, 
the NAM/AO pattern influences both the moisture 
flux and the change in land water storage.

Abstract 
 
As part of the Okhotsk Sea, but separated from it by a depositional feature, lagoons have a particular 
hydrology and specific conditions for bottom sediment accumulation.  Marine organisms in lagoons can be 
exposed to water temperature and salinity fluctuations of significant range.  The Okhotsk Sea lagoons are 
grouped by size into large (100–500 km
2
), medium (10–100 km
2
), small (1–10 km
2
) and very small (less than 
1 km
2
) ones.  The largest lagoons in terms of area are Baikal, Schastya, Piltun, and Perevolochnaya.  Many 
small lagoons are linked to river estuaries. In terms of water depth, lagoons are grouped into shallow (less than 
1 m deep), medium-depth (1–5 m), deep (5–20 m) and very deep (more than 20 m) ones.  The evolution of 
Okhotsk Sea lagoons is associated with the Holocene transgression, during which time they came into 
existence.  As evidenced by well-studied coastal-marine depositions, large sea water bodies, separated by sand 
banks and morphologically close to modern lagoons, started to form at a higher level in the sub-boreal period. 
During subsequent sea level fluctuations above the present-day level, the inner shoreline contour of lagoons 
was reshaping.  Today, some lagoons are separated from the sea, partly filled with alluvial-marine, eolian, and 
biogenic depositions and have turned into lakes.  Lagoons are used as harbors for sheltering small fishing and 
transport vessels.  Some lagoons are used for aquaculture farms where fish, seaweeds, and scallops are 
cultivated.  Lagoons are also a convenient recreational resource for developing sports, tourism, health cures 
and recreation.  The best-studied lagoons of the Okhotsk Sea are Nabil, Chayvo, Busse, and Saroma. 
 
 
A lagoon is part of the sea, separated from it by a bar or 
spit. It is characterized by a lower salinity and by 
specific relief formation and sedimentation conditions. 
Lagoons are a component of many coastline 
geomorphologic types: fiords, rias, corals, abrasive 
accumulative and accumulative flattened coasts. Most 
lagoons are located along low seacoasts, forming a 
separate lagoon type of coast (Leontyev, 1961; 
Leatherman, 1981; Safyanov, 1996). Lagoon 
development has been addressed in detail in all major 
scholarly writings on seacoasts, with main emphasis 
placed on the formation of sand and pebble barriers 
separating lagoons from the sea (Zenkovich, 1962; Bird 
and Schwartz, 1985; Horikawa, 1988, and others). 
 
The following specific trend was identified upon a 
review of relevant literature from the last decades of 
the past century.  Researchers have been showing the 
greatest interest in relatively small water bodies. 
Thus, of the 97 explored lagoons, with their area 
varying from 1 to 8,000 km
2
 (average value is 
78 km
2
), the great majority of studies have focused 
on water bodies with an area of 30–40 km
2
 (Nixon, 
1982).  The average area of 240 lagoons studied in 
the Far East of Russia (1–500 km
2
) is 31.3 km
2
, and 
the best studied lagoons, Busse on Sakhalin Island 
and Novgorodskaya in Primorsky Krai, have an area 
of 43 and 30.7 km
2
, respectively.  One possible 
explanation for this phenomenon is that medium-size 
lagoons are the most interesting for analysis of their 
ecosystems and commercial use.  On the other hand, 
small water bodies do not show individual features of 
lagoon characteristics due to high impacts of alluvial 
or eolian input.  As for large lagoons, the high wave 
impact on shores and marine facilities make them 
less favorable for transportation possibilities and 
commercial activities. 
 
Due to the development of oil and gas offshore 
resources on the continental shelf of Northeast 
Sakhalin, a significant range of research in lithology–
geomorphology and aquatic biology was carried out 
in recent years in larger lagoons such as Piltun, 
Niyvo, Chayvo (121 km
2
), and Nabil (181 km
2
) 
(Brovko, 2000; K аfanov et al., 2003). 
 
The Okhotsk Sea lagoons are grouped by size into 
large (100–500 km
2
), medium (10–100 km
2
), small 
(1–10 km
2
) and very small (less than 1 km
2
) ones. 
The largest of the large lagoons are Baikal, Piltun, 
and Perevolochnaya. In terms of water depth, 
lagoons are grouped into shallow (less than 1 m 
Sea ice, water mass and freshwater processes/Coastal lagoons 
192 PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
deep), medium-depth (1–5 m), deep (5–20 m) and 
very deep (more than 20 m) ones. Lagoon 
distribution in terms of their shape is also of interest. 
The shoreline contour of a water body may be 
linearly stretched, elongate, rounded, segmental, 
triangular or rectangular (Brovko, 1990; Brovko et 
al., 2002) as a result of the evolution of coastal 
processes.  Thus, segmental lagoons are found on the 
abrasive bay/coast in the northwestern part of the 
Okhotsk Sea (Ikit Lagoon) and rectangular ones are 
located on a fiord-type coast (Severnaya Lagoon, 
Bering Sea). Spit-blocked estuaries are often 
triangular (Starka Lagoon, Sea of Japan). 
 
According to the degree of isolation from the sea, 
and to what degree they are influenced by 
hydrodynamic conditions, and by biological, 
chemical and other processes taking place inside 
lagoons, lagoons can be grouped into open lagoons 
(Tyk), semi-open (Baikal), semi-closed (Nabil), and 
closed (Ainskaya).  There is also a separate group of 
dismembered lagoons composing lagoon lakes 
(Rybachye) that have no connection with the sea. 
 
Two lagoon types predominate in the Okhotsk Sea. 
The first type includes large and medium lagoons 
located along the edge of seacoast flatlands (Pomr, 
Piltun, Busse, Saroma, etc.).  This is a “classical” 
lagoon type. They have a contour stretched along the 
coast and are connected with the sea by one of two 
channels. The second type is associated with seacoast 
segments of river valleys (Bolshoye, Nabil, Niyvo, 
Ptichya, etc.). These lagoons are often stretched 
perpendicular or at an angle to the coastline general 
direction. Their development is dominated by 
alluvial processes. Small water bodies in straits 
between islands, typical of low elongate peninsulas, 
make up a separate lagoon type (Terpeniya). 
 
There is complex differentiation of sediment material 
taking place in lagoons, governed by the direction 
and velocities of runoff and tidal currents. Bottom 
sediment is dominated by silts and fine-grain sands. 
Gravel, pebble material and shell fragments also 
occur frequently. 
 
The evolution of Okhotsk Sea lagoons is associated 
with the Holocene transgression, during which time 
they came into existence (Brovko et al., 2002; 
Brovko and K аplin, 1997).  As evidenced by well-
studied coastal-marine depositions, large seawater 
bodies, separated by sand banks and morphologically 
close to modern lagoons, started to form at higher sea 
level in the sub-boreal period.  During subsequent 
sea level fluctuations above the modern level, the 
inner shoreline contour of lagoons was reshaping. 
Some water bodies are already at the post-lagoon 
stage, being partly or fully filled with alluvial-
marine, eolian, or biogenic depositions. 
 
The Okhotsk Sea lagoons have great commercial 
importance in terms of marine civil and transport 
construction, development of mineral deposits, 
production of building materials, fishing and 
aquaculture, and recreation. Many lagoons are 
convenient harbors protected against storms.  This 
makes them suitable for the organization of transport 
facilities and cargo reloading bases, for the 
construction of sheltered ports for small vessel, and 
for the erection of wharves and other civil structures, 
particularly in oil and gas production areas. 
 
Analysis of the interaction of 17 main production and 
other activities showed that conflicts could arise in 
lagoons in 72 cases, 8 of which could have serious 
environmental consequences. Human-induced 
impacts on the coast of Sakhalin Island are of a local 
nature; however, their zone of influence is gradually 
expanding. 
 
Busse Lagoon, granted an important wild area status 
in 1977, is the scene of aquaculture operations being 
conducted by “Sakhalinsky Rybak-2” and “Sakhkor” 
companies which cultivate sea cucumbers and 
scallops.  Important wild area status was earlier 
given to other lagoons on Sakhalin Island: Tunaicha, 
Vavayskiye, Izmenchivoye, and Lunsky. 
 
Other uses of lagoons and lagoon coasts that are 
coming to the fore are recreational activities.  Annual 
sporting and cultural events in the vicinity of Saroma 
Lagoon (Hokkaido) have become widely known. 
Izmenchivoye, Dagi, and Ekhabi lagoons on 
Sakhalin Island have unique reserves of therapeutic 
muds. Scientists of the Far East National University 
and Primorye Branch of Russian Geographic Society 
have launched a proposal to establish the 
Tunaichinsky National Park in the Sakhalin 
southeast, including Tunaicha, Busse, Izmenchivoye 
and other lagoons.  This project could greatly benefit 
from Japan’s experience in establishing their national 
parks, where beautiful coast, spa resorts and cultured 
pearl farms can all be found within a relatively small 
territory of the park (Sutherland and Britton, 1980).

PICES Scientific Report No. 36  193 
There is a gray whale habitat area extending from 
Lunskaya Lagoon to Piltun Lagoon in the Okhotsk 
Sea, which coincides with the offshore oil platform 
deployment area.  Currently, the Korean/Okhotsk 
Sea whale population slightly exceeds 100 
individuals, and there are proposals to organize a 
federal-level wildlife preserve for their protection. 
This would contribute to bird protection as well: 
there are 10,000–12,000 swans and 60,000–80,000 
ducks staying in lagoons during autumn and spring 
migrations.  This would also be beneficial for the 
habitat of Steller’s sea eagle, this area’s permanent 
resident listed on the Red Book of protected species. 
 
Chayvo Lagoon in Northeast Sakhalin, which has 
been a site for semi-stationary observations by the 
Coast Research Center of Far East National 
University since 1982, is exposed to heavy human 
impact.  The greatest changes occurred on Chayvo 
Spit, separating the lagoon from the Okhotsk Sea, 
during construction of Yastreb, an onshore 
directional drilling rig for the Sakhalin-I Project. It is 
the industry’s largest rig, intended for operations in a 
highly seismic area.  During construction, the spit 
surface, representing three beach ridge generations, 
was graded so that all the vegetation cover was 
removed, which resulted in a higher intensity of 
eolian processes. 
 
For the lagoon’s outer, seaward side facing the 
Okhotsk Sea, a coastal dynamic forecast was made 
and stable and retreating coast segments were 
identified, based on multi-year data (Brovko and 
Мikishin, 1999).  It was in one of those “problem” 
segments that a basin for small vessels supporting the 
platform was “cut” into the spit mound and a barge 
was deployed several times as a temporary berthing 
facility (as intended by project design), which 
resulted in a shore-perpendicular “spur dike”.  Due to 
highly active lithodynamic processes on the open 
seacoast, sediment accumulation on one side has 
resulted in scour on the other side, at a rate of more 
than 20 m a year.  The American method used for 
shore protection is sand bags placed on the beach in 
close rows.  Unfortunately, this environmentally 
sound method has proved to be ineffective on the 
Okhotsk Sea coast.

Abstract 
 
In order to monitor variations in the Soya Warm Current (SWC), three high frequency (HF) radar stations were 
installed around the Soya Strait in August 2003.  The radar covers a range of approximately 70 km from the 
coast.  Comparisons of the observed current velocity with drifting buoy and shipboard ADCP data showed 
good agreement with root-mean-square differences of 20 cm/s.  It is shown that the HF radars clearly capture 
seasonal variations of the SWC.  The velocity of the SWC reaches its maximum, approximately 1 m/s, in 
summer, and weakens in winter.  The velocity core is located 20 to 30 km from the coast, and its width is 
approximately 50 km.  The almost same seasonal cycle was repeated in each of these five years from 2003 to 
2008.  Surface transport by the SWC shows a significant correlation with the sea level difference along the 
strait, as derived from coastal tide gauge records.  The cross-current sea level difference, which is estimated 
from the sea level anomalies observed by the Jason-1 altimeter and a coastal tide gauge, also exhibits variation 
in concert with the surface transport and along-current sea level difference.  In addition to the annual variation, 
the SWC exhibits subinertial variations with a period of 5–20 days. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
The Sea of Okhotsk (Fig. 1), a marginal sea adjacent 
to the North Pacific, is one of the southernmost 
seasonal sea ice zones in the Northern Hemisphere 
and it has been conjectured that it is a region in 
which the North Pacific Intermediate Water is 
ventilated to the atmosphere.  The Sea of Okhotsk is 
connected with the Sea of Japan through the Soya/La 
Perouse Strait, which is located between Hokkaido, 
Japan, and Sakhalin, Russia. The Soya Warm 
Current (SWC) enters the Sea of Okhotsk from the 
Sea of Japan through the Soya Strait and flows along 
the coast of Hokkaido as a coastal boundary current. 
It supplies warm, saline water in the Sea of Japan to 
the Sea of Okhotsk.  The current is roughly 
barotropic and shows a clear seasonal variation 
(Aota, 1984; Matsuyama et al., 1999). However, the 
SWC has never been continuously monitored due to 
the difficulties involved in field observations related 
to various reasons, such as severe weather conditions 
in winter, political issues at the border strait, and 
conflicts with fishing activities in the strait. Detailed 
features of the SWC and its variations have not been 
clarified.  Information concerning the variations of 
the SWC and the water exchange between the Sea of 
Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk is important for the 
study of both of these seas.  
 
In this report, observation of the SWC using the HF 
radars is briefly introduced together with variations 
of the SWC revealed by a combination of the 
observed surface current fields with the sea level 
observations from coastal tide gauges and satellite 
altimetry. A detailed description of the HF radar 
system and validation of the observed surface current

data were reported by Ebuchi et al. (2006).  
Fukamachi et al. (2008) estimated volume transport 
of the SWC using the surface current fields together 
with current velocity profiles observed by a bottom-
mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP).  
Ebuchi et al. (2008) investigated seasonal and 
subinertial variations in the SWC using data from HF 
radar, coastal tide gauges and bottom-mounted 
ADCP. 
 
Observation of the SWC using the HF radar 
system 
 
In order to continuously monitor the SWC, three HF 
radars (CODAR Ocean Sensors, SeaSonde) (Barrick 
et al., 1977) were installed around the Soya Strait 
(Fig. 1). The frequency of the HF radar is 13.9 MHz, 
and the range and azimuth resolutions are 3 km and 
5°, respectively. The HF radar covers a range of 
approximately 70 km from the coast. The 
observations were made at one-hourly intervals. We 
measured the beam pattern of the receiving antenna 
and corrected for distortion of the antenna pattern to 
derive accurate radial velocities. Surface current 
vectors were composed in grid cells of 3 × 3 km 
using the radial velocity components observed by the 
radars according to a least squares method. 
 
An example of the observed surface current vector 
field is shown in Figure 2.  Figure 3 is an example of 
the monthly-averaged surface current field. In these 
figures, the SWC, which flows from west to east 
across the Soya Strait and turns toward the southeast 
along the coast, is captured very clearly.  They also 
show southward currents along the west coast of 
Sakhalin, as predicted by numerical experiments 
(Ohshima and Wakatsuchi, 1990; Ohshima, 1994). 
 
The surface current velocity observed hourly by the 
HF radars was compared with in-situ data from 
drifting buoys and shipboard ADCPs (Ebuchi et al., 
2006). The current velocity derived from the HF 
radars showed good agreement with that observed 
using drifting buoys (Fig. 4).  The root-mean-square 
differences were found to be less than 25 cm/s for the 
zonal and meridional components. The observed 
current velocity was also found to exhibit reasonable 
agreement with the shipboard ADCP data (Fig. 5). 
 
Structure and seasonal variation of the Soya 
Warm Current 
 
Using the surface current vector fields observed by 
the HF radars, we discuss seasonal variations of the 
SWC. In order to remove the tidal constituents, a  
25-h running average was applied to the time series 
of the hourly surface current vectors in each grid cell, 
and then daily and monthly mean current fields were 
calculated. To remove the tidal variations, we 
examined a 25-h running average, harmonic analysis, 
and 48-h tide killer filter, and confirmed that the 
residual of the tidal components are negligibly small. 
An example of the monthly-averaged field is shown 
in Figure 3.

Daily southeastward current components across 
Line-A (Fig. 1) were averaged monthly and are

shows year-to-year variations of the monthly mean 
profiles within the five years from 2003 to 2008. The 
monthly-mean profiles show a clear seasonal 
variation. The velocity of the SWC reaches its 
maximum of approximately 1 m/s in summer 
(August and September) and becomes weak in winter 
(January and February).  The current axis is located 
20 to 30 km from the coast in this region, and the 
typical width of the SWC is approximately 50 km. 
These features of the SWC are consistent with the

results of short-term or point-wise observations 
reported in previous studies (Aota, 1984; Matsuyama 
et al., 1999). In Figure 7 it is shown that the almost 
same seasonal cycle has been repeated in these five 
years. 
 
Variations of the surface transport and their 
relationship with sea level differences 
 
Daily surface transport across Line-A was defined by 
the integration of the daily southeastward current 
component along the line from the coast to a point at 
which the component becomes negative.  Figure 8 
shows the time series of the surface transport (thick 
New technology 
200  PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
line). Note that the unit of surface transport is not 
volume/time but area/time because the HF radars 
provide only the surface current velocity.  In winter 
(from January to March), there is often a lack of data 
because the observation region is covered by sea ice. 
 
The driving force of the SWC is ascribed to the sea 
level difference between the Sea of Japan and the Sea 
of Okhotsk (Aota, 1984; Ohshima, 1994). The 
surface velocity of the SWC has been reported to be 
closely related to the sea level difference (Aota, 
1984; Matsuyama et al., 1999).  For comparison with 
the surface transport, as observed by the HF radars, 
we calculated the sea level difference between two 
tide gauge stations, Wakkanai (labeled as WK in 
Fig. 1) and Abashiri (AB in Fig. 1), which represents 
the sea level difference between the Sea of Japan and 
the Sea of Okhotsk.  A 48-hour tide-killer filter was 
applied to the hourly tide gauge records at these 
stations. The daily-mean sea levels were then 
calculated, and atmospheric pressure correction was 
performed using the daily-mean sea level pressure 
observed at weather stations in the cities of 
Wakkanai and Abashiri.  The time series is shown by 
a thin line in Figure 8.  The surface transport of the 
SWC and the sea level difference along the current 
show a good correlation with a correlation 
coefficient of 0.702.  Both time series exhibit not 
only the seasonal variation but also variations with 
time scales of approximately 10 to 15 days. The 
generation mechanism of this subinertial variation in 
the SWC was discussed by Ebuchi et al. (2008) in 
relation with wind-generated coastally trapped waves 
propagating along the east coast of Sakhalin and west 
coast of Hokkaido.  The results shown in Figure 8 
confirm the correlation at various time scales 
between the SWC and the along-current sea level 
difference.

In order to assess variations of the sea level 
difference in the cross-current direction, we utilized 
the sea level anomalies observed by the Jason-1 
satellite altimeter. Figure 9 shows locations of 
ground tracks of Jason-1 in the Sea of Okhotsk. 
Since the spaceborne radar altimeter is not able to 
observe the sea surface height accurately in the 
region close to the coastline, we cannot obtain the 
cross-current sea surface height profiles associated 
with the SWC directly from the altimeter data. 
Therefore, the difference of the sea level anomalies 
between the offshore observations by the altimeter 
(indicated by B in Fig. 9) and the coastal tide gauge 
records at the Wakkanai station is utilized to 
represent the sea level variations across the SWC.  
 
In Figure 8, the variation of sea level difference 
across the SWC is indicated by solid circles. The 
amplitude of the cross-current sea level difference is 
multiplied by 0.6 and is shifted vertically to match 
with the along-current sea level difference (thin line) 
in Figure 8.  The temporal interval of the Jason-1 
observation is 9.91 days.  It is shown that the cross-
current sea level difference is well correlated with 
the along-current sea level difference and also with 
the surface transport of the SWC.  These results 
support evidence that the SWC is in geostrophic 
balance in the cross-current direction, and is driven 
by the sea level difference between the Sea of Japan 
and the Sea of Okhotsk (Aota, 1984). The same 
 
relationship between the cross- and along-current sea 
level differences were discernible in the 10-year 
record of the sea level anomaly obtained by the 
TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter combined with the 
coastal tide gauge records (not shown here). 
 
Concluding Remarks 
 
In this report, we briefly introduced the HF radar 
system deployed in the Soya/La Perouse Strait region 
and analyses of the observed surface velocity fields. 
The HF radars clearly captured seasonal and 
subinertial variations in the SWC.  It is demonstrated 
that HF radar system is a powerful tool to monitor 
surface current fields in coastal regions.

Introduction 
 
In the last couple of decades ionospheric radio 
tomography by navigation low earth orbit satellite 
signal methods has been intensively evaluated.  This 
kind of tomography consists of the synchronous 
registration of one satellite signal by a number of 
receiving stations and is followed by an ionosphere 
electron content distribution reconstruction based on 
a set of integral values (signal phase delay).  Setting 
receivers along a satellite pass allows us to obtain 
height–latitude ionosphere cross-sections. The 
horizontal size of such sections is commonly a few 
thousand kilometres, and the vertical size is about 
1000 km.  The first radio tomography experiments 
were processed about 20 years ago (Kunitsyn and 
Tereshchenko, 2001) and the theoretical part has 
been well investigated, but the approaches to data 
acquisition and processing have been less well 
studied. 
 
Usually the time gap between satellite signal 
registration at the receiving stations and the end of 
thematic data processing is weeks, or even months. 
The main reason for such a time delay in most 
modern tomography systems is because manual 
procedures are used in the process of acquiring and 
processing data which constrains the speed of the 
information being transmitted to the receiver. 
Consequently, data processing requiring visual 
analysis or qualitative assessment for decision 
making needs to be modified to reduce output time. 
At the same time, it is necessary to organize the 
high-speed data acquisition. 
 
The process of tomography data acquisition and 
processing consists of several stages: (1) data 
acquisition from the receiving stations, (2) analysis 
of data characteristics, (3) different transformations 
necessitating decision making, and (4) reconstruction 
of problem solving quality assessments.  Thus, it is 
necessary to develop an automated system of the 
tomography data acquisition and processing in order 
to increase the capability of the data receiving 
operation. 
 
The automated ionospheric tomography data 
processing technique, the processing center and data 
acquisition receiving station interaction algorithm 
and the special software for information acquisition, 
processing, storing and representing are needed to 
develop such a system.  
 
The automated ionospheric tomography data 
processing technique 
 
The technique is based on the phase-difference 
tomography method (Kunitsyn and Tereshchenko, 
2001). The technique parameters were obtained as a 
result of numeric modeling carried out for the 
geometry of the receiving stations’ network, located 
on Sakhalin Island.  The network consists of three 
receiving stations spaced about 250 km apart. 
 
The technique consists of three stages:  
1. Useful signals allocated from data are received 
from the stations on the basis of empirically 
obtained boundary conditions (dispersion of the 
differential phase values in running average 
window N = 10 is less than 1 and the length of the 
signal part is longer than 60 s). 
2. The systematization of the existing data is 
realized by radio sounding sessions.  The data 
belonging to one session are characterized by a 
common satellite identifier and the time 
difference between registering data on the 
receiving stations of the chain is less than 35 min. 
3. The high-frequency signal component (greater 
than 0.1 Hz) is eliminated and then the phase 
derivative with respect to time is calculated.  The 
data are decimated and only every eighth 
measurement is used for further research. 
4. The orbit satellite location row is calculated using 
the SGP4 orbit model (Kelso, 1996) for the 
satellite communication session according to the 
procedure of signal decimation. Thus, the satellite 
New technology 
204  PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
location is calculated for every conformed 
measurement from the data files. 
5. The redundant data for tomography task solving 
are rejected as soon as the locations of the radio 
signals in the area of interest are defined.  For 
example, it is necessary to discard part of the 
received initial data from the southern station if 
the smallest satellite latitudes, fixed for it, are the 
smallest for all the tomography chain stations. It 
is also necessary to reject the data of the southern 
station if the satellite latitudes characterizing this 
information are also less than the minimum 
latitudes for the northern stations.  The analogous 
but opposite conditions are used for culling data 
of the northern stations. 
6. The projecting operator matrix is formed on the 
basis of the signals’ path locations and piece-
planar approximation function for the grid 
dimensions 50 × 25 km and 1000 km height.  The 
vertical grid size is defined by the current session 
geometry. 
7. An optimal initial guess is picked up by forming 
the finite set of the model electron concentration 
distributions and by correspondence analysis of the 
integral measurements calculated on their (model 
distribution sets) basis to experimental data. 
8. The linear equation system (SLE) is formed using 
the created projecting operator matrix, the initial 
guess and measurement vectors Ax = b.  The SLE 
solving procedure is realized by the algebraic 
reconstruction technique (ART) with the 
relaxation iteration algorithm. The iteration 
procedure ends if the velocity of the SLE right 
part of the reconstruction error change becomes 
less than 0.001, otherwise, it will end after 50 
iterations. Thus, the electron concentration 
reconstruction is completed as soon as the values 
in regular grid nodes are calculated. 
 
Consequently, the numerical parameters of every 
stage of the proposed technique were formalized and 
defined as a result of our research.  The special 
software for automated ionospheric tomography 
operative data processing was developed.  
 
Remote receiving station network administration 
 
The task of operative data transfer is solved by 
means of receiving stations connected to the Internet. 
The transfer time of the data from one satellite 
communication session (220 Kb) is 14 s, with a 
typical connection speed of 128 Kb/s to a local 
Internet provider. 
It is necessary to provide the receiving station with 
an actual schedule of satellite radio visibility sessions 
used.  The proposed decision is based on the satellite 
orbit parameters, and the radio visibility zone 
calculation on the basis of the SGP4 model.  If the 
communication session is invisible even for one 
receiving station in the tomography chain, the 
records of satellite communication sessions need to 
be culled after the communication schedule is 
formed. Thus, the files with the communication 
schedule are formed in the way represented above to 
transmit to the receiving station. 
 
The remote control problem is solved by checking 
the accessibility of the receiver stations via the 
Internet and analyzing the retrieved log files 
periodically. 
 
The proposed approaches were realized in the 
algorithm consisting of three procedures: the 
calculation of the satellite radio visibility zone, 
schedules, new data receiving, and receiving station 
administration.  The execution of the procedure is 
determined by the task manager in accordance with 
pre-defined rules. The task manager works 
permanently and checks the schedule periodically.  If 
the current time corresponds to the time of some 
procedural execution, the special process in charge 
for this procedure is initiated.  
 
Special software for ionospheric tomography data 
acquisition and processing  
 
To automate tomography data processing, it is 
necessary to solve a number of supplementary tasks 
such as ballistic data acquisition and managing the 
studies of the data processing. Special software was 
developed to solve the whole spectrum of the 
ionospheric tomography system data processing 
problems revealed above. 
 
The special software structure consists of functional 
segments in charge of acquiring, processing, storing 
and representing information, and management and 
administration of the acquisition and processing 
information processes (Fig. 1). The basic 
functionality of each segment  is provided with the 
execution of one, or more often, several program 
modules.  A user web-interface allows the user to 
access data processing results and manage the 
acquisition and processing data procedures 
interactively using any computer with an Internet 
connection (Fig. 2). 
New technology 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  205 
 
Fig. 1 Flowchart of special software developed for 
ionospheric tomography data acquisition and processing. 
 
Information storage in the system consists of 
managing information acquisition and processing 
from a set of tomography chains realized with the 
provision for further possible enlargement of the 
receiving system segment. 
 
This approach is based on special metadata structure 
usage where each receiving station is characterized 
by the set of the hierarchical and geographical 
characteristics, and allows the system to work with a 
single tomography chain as a set element. 
 
Numerical Modeling Results  
 
The reconstruction of the ionosphere electron 
concentration model distribution was carried out by 
developing special software according to conditions 
identical to real experiment geometry described in 
Romanov et al. (2008) for thematic processing 
quality assessment. The reconstruction errors were 
obtained by calculating the discrepancy between 
initial and reconstructed functions, and defined by 
the following relations (Kunitsyn and Tereshchenko,

Experiment Results 
 
Experimental research on the quality of the 
developed system of ionospheric tomography data 
acquisition and processing was carried out using real 
ionospheric tomography data from stations located 
on Sakhalin Island. 
 
The system of ionospheric tomography data 
acquisition and processing working results are the 
height–latitude distribution of electron concentration 
(Fig. 3). Figure 4 represents the results of the 
comparison between the data from the ionosonde in 
Wakkanai city (Hokkaido Island, Japan), located 
approximately in 150 km to the south of Yuzhno-
Sakhalinsk city (Sakhalin Island, Russia) and the 
information reconstructed with the aid of the 
specially developed software.  The ionosonde data 
were provided by “WDC for Ionosphere, Tokyo, 
National Institute of Information and 
Communications Technology”.  Data from the 
reconstruction of 90 ionosphere states were used: 50 
were received in summer period of 2007 (July–
August) and 40 in January 2008. 
 
The maximum values of ionosphere electron 
concentration in the region of the ionosonde location 
were recalculated to the critical frequency foF2 terms 
for the further comparison.  Good agreement was 
shown, with a mean discrepancy of 15% and δ

0.13.  Maximum discrepancies of 41% and 46% were 
obtained for two reconstructions. 
 
The correlation ration for two data rows was 84% 
(R = 0.84). These results are in good accordance with 
quality assessments of the ionosphere tomography 
reconstructions represented in independent research 
( δ

0.9–0.11) (Kunitsyn et al., 2007).  However, it 
is necessary to note that independent assessments 
were obtained using the phase difference tomography 
approach, but without any automation technique.

The correspondence of these results shows that the 
new technique proposed in this research allows us to 
automatically reconstruct the electron concentration 
distribution in the ionosphere with typical accuracy 
as for the phase difference tomography approach. 
 
The operational speed of the ionospheric tomography 
reconstruction using this system is 5–15 min.  The 
speed of this automated data acquisition and 
processing has no analogue in Russia, and has not 
yielded the best foreign samples.

Conclusions 
 
In the current research, the following results were 
achieved. The technique of automated ionospheric 
tomography data processing was developed.  The 
automated ionosphere reconstruction has an accuracy 
about 15%. 
A remote network management algorithm was 
developed which allows tasks to be solved 
automatically for ionospheric tomography data 
acquisition, dataware and workability administration 
of the receiving stations. 
 
The special software for automated ionospheric 
phase difference tomography data acquisition and 
processing was developed. It allows the 
reconstruction of the ionosphere vertical electron 
concentration distribution in 5–15 min after the 
satellite communication session ends.

Introduction 
 
Last year’s research clearly revealed the existence of 
specific variations in the atmosphere and ionosphere 
parameters during the buildup, or preparation, period 
leading to an earthquake (M > 5) in the area where it 
was about to take place. The characteristic 
dimensions of the earthquake preparation area are 
defined by R = 10
0.43M
, where R is the radius of a 
preparation area and M is the magnitude of an 
earthquake (Pulinets and Boyarchuk, 2004). 
 
The appearance, major morphology characteristics, 
and correlation of the atmosphere and ionosphere 
anomalies are explained in terms of a lithosphere-
atmosphere-ionosphere (LAI) coupling (LAIC) 
model which has been developed recently (Pulinets 
and Boyarchuk, 2004; Pulinets et al., 2006a; 
Pulinets, 2007). 
 
The most active seismic region in Russia is the Far 
East where more than 500 earthquakes of varying 
intensity have taken place in the last 10 years (Fig. 1).  
 
In 2007 the decision to conduct a comprehensive 
experiment using different types of experimental data 
was realized by the completion of the first stage of a 
pilot project to test navigation equipment with the 
signals of Russian and foreign space navigation 
systems to diagnose the precursors of strong 
earthquakes. 
 
The main goal of the experiment was the verification 
and validation of methods and algorithms of data 
acquisition, processing and distribution based on 
existing Russian and foreign navigation, 
meteorological and resource satellites, and helio-
geophysical in-situ information in seismic active 
region of the Russian Far East using the scientific 
principals of Pulinets and Boyarchuk (2004), 
Pulinets et al. (2006a) and Pulinets (2007). 
 
It was first necessary to carry out a registration of the 
different atmosphere and ionosphere (Fig. 2) 
 
Fig. 1 Earthquake distributions on Sakhalin Island, 
Kamtchatka and the Kuril Islands region in 1994–2004 
(data taken from the Russian Geophysical Survey). 
 
parameters described by the LAIC model for the 
pilot project.  A comprehensive approach can lead to 
a new reliable earthquake short-term forecast 
prediction method using even a single parameter of 
atmosphere or ionosphere registration. 
 
During the experiment on August 2, 2007 at 02:59 
UTC, an earthquake took place, with epicenter 
coordinates 46.55°, 141.81° and М = 6.3 near Nevelsk 
city, Sakhalin Island.  Thus the current research is 
directed to the study of anomaly phenomena in 
different media prior to this seismic event. 
 
Experimental Data and Joint Analysis 
 
Comprehensive analysis of meteorology data for a 
series of recent strong earthquakes (Pulinets et al., 
2006a,b) that have taken place in the world reveals 
the temporal dynamics of surface air temperature and 
humidity. The most sensitive parameter is the daily 
temperature range (the difference between minimum

and maximum values). Approximately 5–7 days 
before an earthquake, this parameter usually reaches 
the local maximum and then decreases to the event 
moment.  The maximum of the daily temperature 
range coincides with the minimum of the air 
humidity at the same time. 
 
The temperature and humidity variations from 
standard meteorology observations were analyzed for 
the period of July–August in 2007.  It can be seen 
(Fig. 3) that neither surface air temperature nor 
humidity demonstrate anomalous values. These 
parameters are within the limits of monthly 
variations but the variation corresponds to a typical 
form (simultaneous but opposite variations of the 
temperature and humidity expressed by the ellipse in 
Figure 3) for different earthquakes and the time 
range of the temperature maximum and humidity 
minimum is 4 days before the earthquake.  It can be 
seen that the maximum daily temperature range 
occurred on July 29–30 whereas the humidity 
minimum was on July 30. 
 
Anomalous cloud structures formed over the area of 
earthquake preparation were also analyzed.  The 
linear cloud structures, corresponding with the fault 
system and tectonic plate borders, were distinguished 
in meteorological data by American satellites.  The 
inset in the left hand panel of Figure 4 represents the 
structure of tectonic plates in the Sakhalin and Japan 
areas, and the rest of the panel is the image taken on 
July 30, 2007 by the TERRA satellite.  It can be seen 
that the cloud cover is cut along the tectonic border, 
across Sakhalin Island (marked with an ellipsis). The 
right hand panel shows an image taken by AQUA on 
July 31.  Inside the area marked with an ellipse one 
can clearly distinguish the thread-like cloud lying 
almost over the epicenter of the future earthquake. 
The dimensions of the cloud structures and their 
locations show the scale of tectonic activity before 
the earthquake and confirm the conclusion of 
Pulinets and Dunajecka (2007) that tectonic activity 
increases not only near the epicenter of a future 
earthquake but also on the tectonic borders.  This 
example shows another important factor: the gases 
emanating into the atmosphere from tectonically 
active structures takes place both in the earth and in 
the ocean and the short-term precursors of 
earthquake activity can be successfully registered 
over the ocean surface too.  The results of the 
analysis for the outgoing infrared radiation (OLR) 
from satellite radiometers, of 10–12 µm (Ouzounov 
et al., 2007; Fig. 5), support the evidence discussed 
above. Because of the existence of the atmospheric 
transparency window in these wavelength ranges, the 
radiance is not absorbed by clouds and special data 
processing technology allows us to measure OLR 
under the clouds to approximately 12 km height.

The variations of total electron content (TEC) for 
three different GPS stations in the study region were 
calculated for July–August 2007.  The geomagnetic 
disturbance analysis (Dst index, bottom panel in 
Figure 6) shows almost quiet geomagnetic conditions 
in the region.  On July 12 and 14 there were small 
geomagnetic disturbances of less than 50 nT. 
Nevertheless, the regional ionosphere variability 
calculation method of Pulinets et al. (2007) is used to 
distinguish the possible seismology caused by 
ionosphere variations.  This method allows us to 
reveal ionosphere variations in difficult geomagnetic 
 
conditions. The result is represented in the upper panel 
of Figure 6.  A week before the earthquake (from 
July 24 to 31, marked by arrows), an increase of the 
seismic activity was observed.  The second maximum 
after the earthquake is caused by after-shocks 
observed during the longer time period. 
 
The regional ionosphere variability index running 
average curve has three local maxima in the period 
before the seismic event: July 24, 28 and 30. 
Tomography reconstructions of the vertical electron 
concentration distribution in the ionosphere showed 
the anomalies just in these days.  These anomalies 
are represented in Figure 7.  The figures were 
reconstructed by the phase-different method 
(Kunitsyn and Tereshchenko, 2001) during night 
satellite communication sessions (Fig. 7a, b, and c, 
respectively). Tomography reconstruction for the 
undisturbed ionosphere conditions is represented in 
Figure 7d. 
 
The reconstructions for July 24 and 28 can be 
interpreted as a spreading horizontal wave 
disturbance with wavelength about 200 km.  This 
could be an acoustic-gravity wave induced by an 
electric field anomaly according to Hegai et al. 
(1997).  The reconstruction on July 30 can be 
interpreted as a ring-like structure with a minimum 
over the epicenter of the future earthquake. 
 
In addition to the parameters discussed above, 
lithosphere plate dynamics were analyzed as a result 
of an experiment conducted in the Far East region 
using GPS data of the International Ground Station 
(IGS) network, located in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk 
(Russia) and Shintotsukawa (Japan) (Fig. 8).

As can be seen, the patterns in IGS station 
displacement velocity changes cannot be considered 
good earthquake precursors. However, the 
displacement velocity is almost the only directly 
measured parameter characterizing the processes 
taking place in the Earth’s crust. 
 
Preliminary analysis of the IGS stations’ coordinates 
shows that the sign for the vertical component of 
velocity displacement changed to the opposite sign 
after the earthquake (Fig. 8c and d). Similar behavior 
is typical both for the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk and 
Shintotsukawa stations. For the horizontal 
component, (Fig. 8a and b) there is a significant 
decrease in velocity in the lithosphere plate after the 
earthquake, similar to the results of Carlson and 
Langer (1989). 
 
Conclusions 
 
The major portion of the scientific program of a 
comprehensive experiment carried out in a pilot 
project is mostly completed.  Information describing 
the atmosphere and ionosphere state was collected 
and analyzed.  The anomalies of the parameters 
characterizing the LAI system were revealed, 
confirming the LAIC model represented in Pulinets 
and Boyarchuk (2004), Pulinets et al. (2006a) and 
Pulinets (2007).  It is necessary to note that there was 
a time coherency in the appearance of all anomalies 
registered during the week from July 24 to 31 before 
the earthquake took place on August 2. 
 
From gathered information and from the analysis of 
retrospective earthquake supplementary data, it can 
be concluded that the morphology of the registered 
variations of atmosphere and ionosphere parameters 
before the earthquake of August 2007 on Sakhalin 
Island completely corresponds to the indications that 
were revealed before for strong earthquakes around 
the world. Nevertheless, the successful realization of 
the experiment only expresses the necessity to 
intensify international efforts in the framework of the 
current research.  Because of the transboundary 
nature of the phenomena being studied – the 
signatures of the earthquake precursors in different 
media measured on the territory of just one country 
(Russia or Japan), cannot provide the whole picture, 
but must be a collaborative effort between the two 
countries. In the case of Russian tomography chain 
prolongation to the Japanese territory (Mombetsu 
and Obihiro cities), the accuracy of the vertical 
distribution of the ionosphere electron concentration 
reconstruction will significantly increase due to the 
amount of data sources increasing. Thus, at the same 
time, the reliability of ionosphere earthquake 
precursor diagnostics will increase.

Abstract 
 
Spectroellipsometry is the peak of polarization optics.  The creation of multichannel polarization optical 
instrumentation and use of spectroellipsometric technology are very important for the real-time ecological 
monitoring of the aquatic environment.  Spectroellipsometric devices give us high precision of measurements. 
Spectroellipsometric and their multichannel measurements in an aquatic environment provide the basis for the 
application of modern algorithms for the recognition and identification of pollutants (Klimov et al., 2002). 
New original elements (coaxial polarization switchers and achromatic compensators), developed at the 
Institute of Radio Engineering and Electronics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, allow the design of 
inexpensive polarization systems, such as spectroscopic ellipsometers, polarization spectrometers, 
polarimeters, dichrometers, polarization microscopes and interferometers, sensitive photometers, and 
differential reflectometers without expensive standard polarization elements. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
The creation of multichannel polarization optical 
instrumentation and the use of spectroellipsometric 
technology are very important for the real-time 
ecological monitoring of aquatic environment.  The 
ability to handle multiparametric problems in 
monitoring efficiently greatly depends on the 
precision and simplicity of ellipsometric devices.   
 
This report aims to describe:  
• A technology that combines the use of 
spectroellipsometry and algorithms of identification 
and recognition which allows the creation of a 
standard integral complex of instrumental, 
algorithmic, modular and software tools for the 
collection and processing of data on aquatic 
environment quality, and has forecasting and 
decision-making functions;   
• A compact measuring–information multichannel 
spectroellipsometric system for monitoring the 
quality of the aquatic environment that is based 
on the combined use of spectroellipsometry and 
training, classification, and identification of 
algorithms.   
 
This spectroellipsometric system will differ from 
modern foreign analogues by the use of a new and very 
promising method of ellipsometric measurements, an 
original element base of polarization optics and a 
complex mathematical approach to estimating the 
quality of a water body subjected to anthropogenic 
influence.  
 
Unlike foreign analogues, the system has no rotating 
polarization elements.  This allows one to increase 
the signal-to-noise ratio and the long-term stability 
of measurements to simplify and reduce the price of 
multichannel spectroellipsometers.  The system will 
be trained to recognize pollutants in the aquatic 
environment.  
 
Methodology 
 
Methodology consists of: 
• A new approach in ellipsometry, based on binary 
polarization modulation,  
• New low cost-effective polarization elements,  
• No rotating polarization elements,  
• Excellent signal-to-noise ratio and the long-term 
stability of measurements that makes it possible 
to simplify and reduce the price of multichannel 
spectroellipsometers,   
• One of the key elements of the systems being a 
polarization switch which transforms unpolarized 
light from a source into highly linear polarized 
light with alternate (up to KHz or more) and 
orthogonal polarizations,  
• Sets of silicon photodiodes with arbitrary access 
to them,  
New technology 
216  PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
• Flexibility, simple design, low cost, high 
precision, long-term stability.

This is the first time the combined use of real-time 
spectroellipsometry measurements and data 
processing methods have been realized in an 
Adaptive Identifier (Fig. 1).

modulation. 
Adaptive Identifier device composition  
 
• Polarizer block,  
• Analyzer block,  
• Power supply unit,  
• Illuminator,  
• Fiber-optic cable,  
• Notebook with interface unit,  
• Wide-band filters.  
 
The algorithmic support of the Adaptive Identifier is 
based on a complex application of recognition and 
classification algorithms using 128 spectra images 
registered during a fixed period of time (Mkrtchyan 
et al., 2004; Mkrtchyan et al., 2005).  
       
A time interval of 1 second is usually established and 
provides about 30 values of brightness for each of 
the 128 optical channels.  The spectra obtained are 
sources for a set of statistical parameters and 
different characteristics united into vector spaces to 
be used for comparison with the standard samples of 
common pollutants stored on the computer.  
 
The technology of this comparison depends on the 
diversity of identification methods.  The system is 
trained to recognize the pollutants of an aquatic 
environment.  
       
The Adaptive Identifier is designed to learn from the 
measurements of spectral characteristics and the 
simultaneous independent measurement of chemical 
element contents in the aquatic environment.  As a 
result, a standard data bank is created in the 
knowledge base so that identifications and 
comparisons can be made.  The software of the 
Adaptive Identifier provides different algorithms for 
the solution for identification problems, and cluster 
analysis is among of them.   
 
Using spectroellipsometric technology:  
1. Measurements of natural and waste water quality 
may be performed using:   
a) A transmission scheme when quality of the 
sample is measured by inserting the fused 
quartz cuvette containing analyzed water into 
the spectroellipsometer device.   
b) A reflection scheme when the  quality of 
water is measured by inserting the spectro-
ellipsometer sensor into water media being 
examined.  
2. Because of the high accuracy of measurements 
with the spectroellipsometer, it is not possible to 
New technology 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  217 
use a whole method potential for remote 
measurements of natural and waste water quality. 
(Even small waves, ripples, foam can influence 
the quality of measurements.)  
 
Results 
 
The Adaptive Identifier can be used in different 
fields where the quality of water should be estimated 
or the presence of a particular set of chemical 
elements should be revealed. The Adaptive Identifier 
solves these problems by real-time monitoring of the 
aquatic environment.  In the stationary version it 
allows the tracking of the dynamics of water quality 
in a stream, and when placed on a ship, it allows the 
measurement of water parameters along the route.  
 
The functionality of the Adaptive Identifier can be 
extended by increasing the volume of standards in 
the knowledge base.  The use of a natural light 
source allows the examination of soils, the indication 
of oil products on a water surface, the determination 
of the degree of pollution in the atmosphere and the 
estimation of the conditions of other elements in the 
environment whose spectral images may change.  
 
An adaptive spectroellipsometric technology may be 
applied to the following areas for:  
• Estimation of natural and wastewater quality,   
• Analysis of liquids in medicine, biochemistry, 
food industry,   
• Measurement of the mineralization level and 
chemical pollution of  reservoirs, depending on 
the pollution type,  
• Estimation of water salinity variations,  
• Ellipsometrically based biosensor and gas sensor 
systems,  
• Testing organic pollution clots in the water 
environment.  
 
Experience  
 
The Adaptive Identifier was tested under 
expeditionary conditions on board the R/V Dmitry 
Mendeleev in the Japan Sea, in the central areas of 
the Pacific Ocean, and during the investigation of 
aqueous systems of South Vietnam and Siberia (Lake 
Baikal, Angara and Yenisey rivers) within the 
framework of Russian–American and Russian– 
Vietnamese  ecological expeditions.  
 
A Russian–Vietnamese scientific and engineering 
laboratory has been built to create a standards base 
and to prepare the Adaptive Identifier for full-scale 
production. 
   
Conclusions 
 
The main objective of this work is to create compact 
information systems for monitoring the quality of the 
aquatic environment and to investigate their potential 
efficiency.  These systems are based on the 
combined application of methods of the 
spectroellipsometry, and algorithms of training, 
classification, and identification.  The realization of 
this objective will require the combined use of 
engineering and the algorithmic tools providing real-
time measurements and data processing.   
 
The technology, using a combination of 
spectroellipsometry and the algorithms of detection 
and classification will allow the creation of an 
original system of instrumental, algorithmic, modular 
and software tools for the collection and processing 
of data on the aquatic environment, and has 
forecasting and decision-making functions.  
 
The theoretical part of the work will include the use 
of methods of polarization optics, mathematical 
statistics, the theory of pattern recognition and 
mathematical modeling for:   
• Creation of a new element base for polarization 
optics with simple and efficient switches of the 
polarization state (SPS) that will successfully 
substitute for the conventional expensive 
polarizer–modulators of polarization state with 
rotating polarization elements;    
• Optimization of the ellipsometric method  
regarding the change of amplitudes and phases of 
mutually orthogonal components of electro-
magnetic radiation used to measure the thickness 
of thin films on a water surface, and the 
determination of sensitivity and precision limits 
of adaptive spectroellipsometers in different 
operating regimes;  
• Creation of methods for investigating the water 
surface, and the determination of statistical 
characteristics of “spottiness” as informative 
signs for solving detection, classification and 
identification problems;  
• Elaboration and optimization of algorithms for the 
detection, classification and identification of the 
characteristics of the aquatic environment for  
adaptive spectroellipsometers;  
• Creation of a bank of standards used for the 
measurement of pollution levels in the aquatic

environment to be employed for training the 
adaptive spectroellipsometer.  
 
The experimental part of the work described in 
report will include a description of the laboratory and 
on-site measurements of absorption, scattering, and 
reflection of electromagnetic waves from different 
aquatic objects. 
 
The results given in this paper illustrate how the 
combined use of spectroellipsometric measurements 
and recognition algorithms give a possibility to 
economize material resources. It is obvious that the 
strategy of the modeling technology is in the 
interplay of model calculations and on-site 
experiments.

Abstract 
 
Biocomplexity of the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem (OSE) and its synthesis using a simulation model of the OSE, 
allowing us to assess conditions in the ecosystem, depending on global and regional changes in an 
environment, poses a difficult problem.  By using this model it may be possible to establish some laws of 
dynamics of a trophic pyramid of the sea, and also to understand the mechanisms regulating the community of 
the sea due to external influences.  This paper is oriented to the development of biocomplexity indices based 
on remotely measured environmental characteristics.  Microwave radiometry is used as an effective technique 
to assess sea water parameters.  Other ranges help to provide input information for the Okhotsk Sea 
Biocomplexity Model that will be developed in the framework of this work. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Biocomplexity refers to phenomena that result from 
dynamic interactions between the physical, 
biological and social components of the Nature/ 
Society System (NSS).  The investigations of the 
processes of interaction between the Society and 
Biosphere are, as a rule, targeted at understanding 
and estimating the consequences of such 
interactions.  The reliability and precision of these 
estimations depend on criteria founded on 
conclusions, expertise and recommendations. At 
present, there is no unified methodology for 
selecting criteria due to the absence of a common 
science-based approach to the ecological 
standardization of anthropogenic impacts on the 
natural environment.  After all, the precision of 
ecological expertise for the planning and functioning 
of anthropogenic systems, as well as the quality of 
the global geoinformation monitoring data, depend 
on these criteria. 
 
The processes that have their origin in the 
environment can be presented as a combination of 
interactions between its subsystems.  The human 
subsystem is a part of the environment and it is 
impossible to divide the environment into separate 
subsystems such as Biosphere and Society.  The task 
is to search for methodologies to describe existing 
feedbacks between Nature and Humanity and to 
simulate reliably the dynamic tendencies in the NSS. 
Unfortunately, the part of the NSS that is responsible 
for the quality of modeling the climatic processes 
introduces instability in the modeling results.  That is 
why it is supposed that the NSS climatic component 
is replaced by a scenario describing stable climatic 
trends during the time interval of investigation.  
What is actually studied is the NSS. 
 
We introduce a scale of biocomplexity ranging from 
the state where all interactions between the 
environmental subsystems are broken down to the 
state level where they correspond to natural 
evolution.  In this case, we have an integrated 
indicator of the environmental state including 
bioavailability, biodiversity and survivability. It 
reflects the level of all types of interactions among 
the environmental subsystems.  In reality, specific 
conditions exist where these interactions are 
changed and transformed.  For example, under the 
biological interaction of the consumer/producer or 
competition-for-energy-resources type there exists 
some minimal level of food concentration where 
contacts between interacting components cease. In 
the common case, physical, chemical and other types 
of interactions in the environment depend upon 
specific critical parameters. Environmental 
dynamics is regulated by these parameters and the 
main task is in the parametrical description of it.  
Biocomplexity reflects these dynamics.

Biocomplexity Model 
 
The NSS consists of subsystems B
i
(i = 1,…, m), the 
interactions of which are formed during time as 
functions of many factors.  The NSS biocomplexity 
reflects the structural and dynamic complexity of its  
components. In other words, the NSS biocomplexiry 
is formed under the interaction of its subsystems 
{B
i
}.  In due course the subsystems B
i
 can change 
their state and, consequently, change the topology of 
the relations between them. The evolutionary 
mechanism of adaptation of the subsystem B
i
 to the 
environment allows the hypothesis that each 
subsystem B
I
,
  
independent from its type, has the 
structure B
i,S
, behaviour B
i,B
 and goal B
i,G
, so that B
i
 
= {B
i,S
, B
i,B
, B
i,G
}.  The strivings of subsystem B
i
  to 
achieve certain preferable conditions are represented 
by its goal Â
i,G
.  The expedience of the structure B
i,S
 
and the purposefulness of the behaviour B
i,B
 for 
subsystem B
i
 are estimated by the effectiveness with 
which the goal B
i,G
 is achieved. 
 
As an example, we consider the process of fish 
migration. The investigations of many authors 
revealed that this process is accompanied by an 
external appearance of purposeful behaviour. From 
these investigations it follows that fish migrations are 
subbordinated to the principle of complex 
maximization of effective nutritive ration, given the 
preservation of favourable environmental conditions 
(temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pollution 
level, depth).  In other words, the travel of migrating 
species takes place at characteristic velocities in the 
direction of the maximum gradient of effective food, 
given adherence to ecological restrictions.  That is 
why we can formulate that the goal B
i,G
 of the fish 
subsystem is toward the increase of their ration, and 
the behaviour B

 . 
 
Since the interactions of the subsystems B
i
 (i = 1, 
…, m) are connected with chemical and energetic 
cycles, it is natural to suppose that each subsystem B
i
 
realizes the geochemical and geophysical 
transformation of matter and energy to remain in a 
stable state.  The formalism of approach to this 
process consists in the supposition that the 
interactions between the NSS subsystems are 
represented as a process whereby the systems 
exchange a certain quantity V of resources spent in 
exchange for a certain quantity W of resources 
consumed.  We represent this process by the name 
(V,W)-exchange. 
 
The goal of the subsystem is the most advantageous 
(V,W)-exchange, i.e., it  tries to get maximum W in 
exchange for minimum V.  The quantity W is a 
complex function of the structure and behaviour of 
interacting subsystems, W = W(V,B

where K is the space of subsystem numbers 
interacting with the subsystem B

Figure 1 represents a block-scheme for the global 
model of the NSS (GMNSS).  The synthesis of the 
GMNSS is based on its consideration as a self-
organizing and self-structuring system, in which the 
elements are coordinated in time and space by the 
process of natural evolution. The anthropogenic 
constituent in this process breaks this integrity. 
Attempts to parameterize, on a formal level, the 
process of co-evolution of nature and humans, as 
elements of the biosphere, are connected with the 
search of a single description of all processes in the 
NSS, which would combine all spheres of knowledge 
in perceiving the laws of the environment.  Such a 
synergetic approach forms the basis of numerous 
studies in the field of global modeling (Kondratyev 
et al., 2002; Kondratyev et al., 2004). 
 
All of this corroborates the fact that biocomplexity is 
related to categories which are difficult to measure 
empirically and to express by quantitative values. 
However, we will try to transfer the truly verbal 
tautological reasoning to formalized quantitative 
definitions.  For the transition to gradations of the 
scale Ξ with quantitative positions it is necessary to 
postulate that relationships between two values of Ξ 
are of the type  Ξ

 or Ξ

.  In other 
words, there always exists a value of the scale ρ that 
defines a biocomplexity level Ξ → ρ = f(Ξ), where  f  
is a certain transformation of the bio-complexity 
concept to a number.  Let us attempt to search for a 
satisfactory model with which to reflect the verbal

biocomplexity image onto the field of conceptions 
and signs, subordinating to the formal description

Certainly there arises the need to overcome 
uncertainty for which it is necessary to complicate 
the scale Ξ, for example, to introduce weight 
coefficients for all NSS subsystems.  The origin of 
these coefficients depends on the type of subsystem. 
That is why three basic subsystem types are 
selected: living and nonliving subsystems and 
vegetation.  Living subsystems are characterized by 
their density, estimated by numbers of elements or 
by biomass value per unit area or volume. 
Vegetation is characterized by the type and portion 
of occupied territory.  Nonliving subsystems are 
measured by their concentration per unit square or 
volume of the environment.  In the common case, 
certain characteristics {k
i
}, corresponding to the 
significance of the subsystems {B
i
}, are assigned to 
every subsystem B
i
 ( i = 1,..., m).  As a result, we 
obtain more closely the definition of the formula to 
move from the biocomplexity concept to the scale Ξ 
of its indicator: 
 
ξ =

It is clear that ξ = ξ(ϕ,λ,t), where ϕ and λ are 
geographical latitude and longitude, respectively, and 
t is the current time. For the territory Ω, the 
biocomplexity indicator is defined as mean value 
  
ξ
Ω
(t) = (1/σ)
() ϕλ , ∈
∫
Ω
ξ(ϕ,λ,t) dϕ dλ, 
 
where σ is the area of Ω.  Thus the indicator ξ
Ω
(t) is 
the integrated NSS complexity characterization 
reflecting the individuality of its structure and the 
behaviour at each time t in the space Ω.  According to 
natural evolution laws, a decrease (increase) in ξ
Ω
 will 
correspond to an increase (decrease) of biocomplexity 
and the survivability of the nature–anthropogenic 
systems. Since a decrease of biocomplexity disturbs 
the exclusiveness of the biogeochemical cycles and 
leads to a decrease in stress on nonrenewable 
resources, then the binary structure of the matrix X is 
changed in the direction to intensify the resource-
improverishment technologies.

A maximal value of ξ = ξ
max
 (≈ 20) is reached during 
spring–summer time when nutritive relations into the 
Okhotsk Sea ecosystem are extended, the intensity of 
energetic exchanges is increased, horizontal and 
vertical migration processes are stimulated. In the 
wintertime, the value of ξ is changed near ξ
min
 (≈ 8). 
The spatial distribution of ξ reflects a local 
variability of the food spectrum for the components.  
Calculations show that basic variability into the ξ
*
 = 
ξ/ξ
max
  is caused by migration processes. Under these 
processes the quick redistribution of the interior 
structure of matrices X and ||C
ij
|| occurred.  Many 
fishes migrate to the shelf zone during springtime, 
and during winter they move to the central aquatories 
of the Okhotsk Sea. Therefore, ξ
*
 → 1 during spring 
and ξ
*
→ 0.6 during winter for the shelf zone.  This 
means that the biocomplexity of the Okhotsk Sea 
ecosystem on the shelf  decreases by 40% in winter 
in comparison with spring. For the central aquatories, 
ξ
*
 is changed to near 0.7 during the year.  Such 
stability of a biocomplexity indicator is explained by 
the balance between nutritive correlations and 
productivity during spring, summer and winter.

It can be to establish that variability in ξ

 reflects the 
changes of fish congestions which are controlled by 
environmental conditions. Specifically, during 
springtime.  Pacific herring Clupea pallasi escapes  
occupy the area with T

different depths for their feeding and spawning.  All 
these processes have an influence on the variability 
of ξ

between ξ

dynamics of the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem demand 
additional studies.

complexity of the sea ecosystem. The basic 
variability in ξ is caused by the migration process.

Conclusion 
 
Biocomplexity is clearly an important characteristic 
of the NSS dynamics. It has importance for the 
complex study of interactions between living and 
non-living elements of environment and, more 
significantly, it can be used to make valuable 
contributions to the understanding and solution of 
 
key socio-economic and environmental problems. It 
is reasonable to expect that over the near future the 
biocompexity will be able to be used as an indicator 
analogous to such indicators as the normalized 
difference vegetation index (NDVI) and leaf area 
index (LAI) (Krapivin et al., 2006).  It appears that 
the only satisfactory way to develop an appropriate 
definition of a biocomplexity indicator is to 
summarize the many structural ideas of a series of 
global biospheric models.  The synthesis of these 
models requires not only their compatibility with 
global databases, but also the interconnections 
between different sources of data.  
 
The Okhotsk Sea ecosystem maintains a significant 
position in the global natural system.  At the present 
time it has a low level of pollution, with fishing 
being the main anthropogenic influence. A 
correlation between the OSE state and global 
changes is one of problems which is discussed both 
in the framework of regional investigations and in 
global studies of the environment. The OSE interacts 
with biosphere processes via the influence of the 
global climate, and on the Pacific Ocean.  This 
influence is reciprocal. 
 
This paper proposes a global model and 
biocomplexity indicator for only one category in 
which biospheric processes are considered to 
predominate.  Further study will be oriented to the 
expansion of information, taking into account the 
global model, and it will be necessary to correlate the 
dependencies between socio-economic and 
biospheric components.

Abstract 
 
The main advantage of the remote sensing lidar method is the potential to acquire data from oceanic subsurface 
layers, including the recording of phytoplankton and zooplankton layers, pelagic fish schools and transparency 
of water.  The maximum depth for registering fish schools and plankton by airplane-lidar is equal to 30–40 m 
for the Barents Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. 
 
The development of identification methods for recording schools of organisms (pelagic fishes, medusae, 
phytoplankton, zooplankton) is the main task in the practical use of airborne lidar surveys.  The analysis of 
lidar data shows that each organism object has a specific combination of parameters and types of correlation 
with each other. So, a system of signatures for object identification is being designed.  
 
A set of criteria is developing in several directions: 
• The analysis of full-scale research results applying aerial and vessel lidars supplied with the data from 
accompanying observations; 
• the conducting of full-scale nature and laboratory experiments with certain objects, first with fish and 
plankton to determine their characteristics of reflection, scattering and depolarization of light;    
• The development of specific software for the visualization of laser sounding data and calculation of light 
scattering layer parameters and single signals. 
 
The algorithms for efficient object identification in real-time surveying of the marine area are under 
development.

Abstract 
 
Spatial distributions of the toxic dinoflagellate, Alexandrium tamarense, were examined in the Okhotsk Sea off 
Hokkaido in summer to clarify the relationship between its distribution and water mass structure. Surveys were 
conducted at 37 stations in late July in 2002–2007.  Water samples for cell counts of A. tamarense were 
collected from each layer of 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 m depth at each station. Nutrient concentrations of each water 
sample in 2004–2007 were analyzed.  Results show that A. tamarense appeared every year although its 
abundance fluctuated year by year, and it rarely appeared in 2005.  A high abundance of A. tamarense tended 
to be found frequently in the oceanic area of surface low-salinity water (LSW, salinity < 32.5) and in mixed 
water (MW) among the water masses, while a low abundance was found along the coastal area of the Soya 
Warm Current (SWC, salinity > 33.6) and in the dichothermal water (DTW, water temperature < 2°C) layer 
depth > 30 m. PO
4
-P concentrations in each water mass were in the order DTW > LSW > SWC.  The lowest 
PO
4
-P concentration in the SWC might be limiting factor for growth of A. tamarense.  On the other hand, the 
reason for low A. tamarense abundance in the DTW might be due to the low water temperature.  The results 
suggest that the LSW is the optimum water mass for growth of A. tamarense. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Paralytic shellfish poisoning caused by the toxic 
dinoflagellate, Alexandrium tamarense, accounts for 
much economic damage to the scallop culturing 
fishery along the coast of Hokkaido in the Okhotsk 
Sea once every few years (Nishihama, 1994; 
Shimada and Miyazono, 2005).  Prediction of the 
poisoning is very important for fishing and shipping 
plans for scallops. 
 
The Okhotsk Sea off Hokkaido is known for its very 
characteristic oceanographic structures, such as sea 
ice in winter (Aota, 1975).  The following four water 
masses generally distribute in the area in summer 
(Aota, 1975).  
 
1. Soya Warm Current (SWC, salinity > 33.6): 
Warm current flowing along the coast of 
Hokkaido in the direction from Wakkanai to 
Abashiri, originating the Tsushima Warm 
Current; 
2. Surface low-salinity water (LSW, water 
temperature > 2°C, salinity < 32.5):  Low salinity 
water mass in the surface layer of the oceanic 
area; 
3. Dichothermal water (DTW, water temperature 
< 2°C):  Cold water mass under the LSW of the 
oceanic area; 
4. Mixed water (MW):  Water mass existing among 
the above, but not belonging to the above. 
 
Nishihama (1994) reported that A. tamarense 
appeared in the surface waters of the oceanic area in 
July 1989 at the same stations as in the present 
study. However, the sampling was conducted only in 
the surface layer so that the spatial distribution of 
A. tamarense in the four water masses had not been 
revealed. The present study was carried out to 
clearly detail the relationship between spatial 
distribution and water mass structure and to get 
fundamental information for the prediction of 
shellfish poisoning.

A map of sampling stations and survey periods are

samples were collected from each layer of 0, 10, 20, 
30 and 40 m depth using Nansen bottles (1 liter) at 
each station. The 500-ml water samples were fixed 
with 2% formalin and concentrated to 1 ml by 
sedimentation for 6 h.  The 0.1 ml subsamples 
stained with one drop of fluorescent brightener 28 
(Sigma) saturated solution were used for cell 
counting of A. tamarense under an epi-fluorescence 
microscope (Nikon, XF-EFD2) with UV excitation.  
Water temperature and salinity were measured using 
CTD instruments (Seabird, SBE-911plus).  The 230-
ml surface water samples were filtered with 
Whatman GF/F. The filters were frozen at –20°C in 
situ, and chlorophyll-a concentrations were 
measured using a fluorometer (Turner Design, 10-
AU) after 6 h extracting with 90% acetone in the 
laboratory. Nutrient concentrations (NO
3
-N and 
PO
4
-P) of all the 30-ml water samples in 2004–2007 
were analyzed using an autoanalyzer (Bran + 
Luebee, Autoanalyzer II).

Results 
 
The spatial distribution of water temperature, water 
masses, and cell density of A. tamarense are shown 
in Figures 2a and b.  The SWC flowed along the 
coast of Hokkaido, the LSW was found in the 
surface shallower than 10 m deep, the DTW was 
observed in the layer lower than 30 m deep, and the 
MW was found among the water masses every year 
from 2002–2007. Alexandrium tamarense was 
widely found in the oceanic area outside the SWC, 
fluctuating annually both quantitatively and spatially 
although it was rarely found in 2005.  Blooms of 
A. tamarense (>10
3 
cells l
–1
) appeared near the front 
area outside the SWC in 2004 and 2006. 
 
Cell density of A. tamarense superimposed on a 
temperature–salinity diagram is shown in Figure 3. 
Cell density of A. tamarense in each water mass is 
shown in Table 2 and water temperature and salinity 
in each range of A. tamarense cell density is shown 
in Table 3.  Table 2 shows that the highest cell 
densities were found in the LSW followed by the 
MW. However, cell densities were low in the SWC 
and the DTW. As to the vertical distribution, 
A.tamarense was frequently found in the surface 
layer shallower than 20 m deep occupied by the 
LSW and the MW, but rarely found in the layer 
deeper than 30 m, occupied by the DTW (Fig. 2). 
Blooms of A. tamarense (>10
3 
cells l
–1
) appeared at a 
water temperature of 5.9–14.4°C with a salinity of 
31.9–32.5 (Table 3). 
 
Nutrient concentrations in each water mass are 
shown in Table 4. Higher cell densities did not tend 
to be found in water with higher nutrients. 
Especially, the lowest densities were found in the 
DTW with highest nutrients, but lowest water 
temperature.  On the other hand, in water of the 
lower nutrients, such as the LSW and the SWC, 
A.tamarense was frequently found in the LSW and 
rarely found in the SWC. Comparing nutrient 
concentrations of the LSW and the SWC, mean 
NO
3
-N concentration was lower in the LSW, and 
mean PO
4
-P concentration was lower in the SWC, 
respectively (t-test, p < 0.01). 
 
Discussion

of the LSW and the MW in the oceanic area while 
they rarely appear in the SWC along the coastal area 
and in the DTW under the LSW and the MW. The 
present study reveals the detailed spatial distribution 
of A. tamarense in all the water masses in addition to 
the report on the distribution only in the surface 
layer by Nishihama (1994).  Studies have shown that 
the optimum water temperature for A. tamarense is 
8–12°C (Nishihama, 1982) or 5–10°C (Shimada et 
al., 1996) in Funka Bay, southern Hokkaido.  In the 
present study the water temperature for A. tamarense 
blooms, 5.9–14.4°C, was almost same as that 
reported for Funka Bay.

Fukuyo (1982) noted that germinated cells of 
A. tamarense could not grow at low water 
temperatures less than 5°C.  Tarutani (1999) and 
Yamamoto and Tarutani (1999) suggested that 
A. tamarense was difficult to increase to dominant 
species because of their larger half-saturation 
constant compared to that of dominant diatom 
species for PO
4
-P uptake.  Shinada (2005) suggested 
that PO
4
-P concentration of the SWC was too low 
for growth of A. tamarense. From these reports, and 
the present study, it is suggested that A. tamarense 
cannot increase in the DTW having low water 
temperature and cannot increase in the SWC having 
low PO
4
-P concentrations.

MacIntire et al. (1997) suggested that A. tamarense 
could sustain growth through nocturnal migrations 
to a nutrient-rich deeper layer for nitrogen uptake. In 
the present study, it is suggested that A. tamarense 
could increase in the LSW of low NO
3
-N 
concentration through the nocturnal migrations to 
the MW mixed with the DTW for NO
3
-N uptake. 
Ogata et al. (1996) reported that A. tamarense could 
increase through utilization of organic nitrogen. It is 
also supposed that A. tamarense might utilize 
organic nitrogen in the LSW in the present study. 
 
Therefore, it can be concluded that LSW is the 
optimum water mass for growth of A. tamarense. 
Annual fluctuations of relative frequency of each 
water mass of samples on the same layers at 
common stations are shown in Figure 5.  It can be 
found in the fluctuations that for the sum of the 
LSW and the MW, the frequency of preferable water 
for A. tamarense was lowest in 2005. The result 
suggests that the frequency, that is, the volume of 
 
each water mass is one of the important factors to 
control the abundance of A. tamarense in the area.

Abstract 
 
Spatial and seasonal distributions of copepods were investigated in the Okhotsk Sea off eastern Hokkaido, in 
relation to the hydrography from spring to summer in 2002.  Several cold water species such as Neocalanus 
spp. other than Neocalanus cristatus, Pseudocalanus minutus, Pseudocalanus newmani, Metridia pacifica, 
Metridia okhotensis, Acartia longiremis, and Oithona similis were predominant.  Three groups of coastal, 
pelagic, and mixtures of coastal and pelagic copepod assemblages were identified during the investigations.  
These assemblages might be affected by the Soya Warm Current (SWC) and the extension of the front of Cold 
Intermediate Water (CIW). 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Copepods are the most numerous taxonomic group in 
the zooplankton community and are important as 
links between primary production and many species 
of fishes in the ecosystems (Mauchline, 1998).  The 
Okhotsk Sea along the coast of Hokkaido supports 
many fishery resources such as salmon, herring, 
walleye pollock, arabesque greenling, etc. Copepods 
are one of the most important prey for these fishes 
(Motoda and Sato, 1949; Kamba, 1977; Blaxter and 
Hunter, 1982; Pearcy, 1992).  We studied the spatial 
and temporal variability of zooplankton, including 
copepods, in near the coasts of the Okhotsk Sea off 
eastern Hokkaido, as part of an ecological study of 
juvenile chum salmon (Asami et al., 2007), and 
suggested that the Soya Warm Current (SWC) along 
the coast of the Okhotsk Sea of Hokkaido might be 
one of the key factors affecting zooplankton 
variability.  Irie (1990) also studied the seasonal 
biomass of zooplankton in waters further off-shore of 
the Okhotsk Sea of eastern Hokkaido from spring to 
summer.  However, there is little information on the  
zooplankton community at the species level.  This 
study was conducted in order to describe the copepod 
assemblages and to understand the factors affecting 
copepod variability from spring to summer in the 
Okhotsk Sea off eastern Hokkaido. 
 
Materials and Methods 
 
Study sites were located along O3 line (44°02.1′N 
~45°08.1′N, 144°19.8′E), established as a monitoring 
line by the Hokkaido Fisheries Experiment Station 
(Fig. 1). Six stations were on this line.  Since this line 
transverses along the Kitami-Yamato Rise, the depth 
between Stn. O34 and St. O36 varied greatly. 
Investigations were conducted in mid-April (April 16
 
and 17), early June (June 3 and 4) and late July (July 
22 and 24) in 2002.  Water temperature and salinity 
were measured by using a CTD.  Surface water 
temperature was measured with a thermometer from 
a surface bucket sample.  Surface salinity was also 
sampled by bucket and determined by salinometer in 
the laboratory.  
 
Zooplankton samples were collected with a Norpac 
net (45-cm mouth and 0.33 mm mesh size) equipped 
with flowmeter from 150 m at Stn. O33, O34, O35 
and O36 or near bottom at Stn. O31, and O32 from 
the surface.  The net was towed vertically at a speed 
of 1.0 m/s.  All samplings were done at night. After 
zooplankton collections, samples were immediately 
preserved in 5% buffered formalin.  At a laboratory, a 
plankton splitter was used to divide samples into 
subsamples (Motoda, 1959), depending on 
abundance, and a dissecting microscope was used to  
 
Biological processes/Disturbances by oil and gas development 
234  PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
count the number of zooplankton in each taxonomic 
group.  Copepods were identified to species level as 
far as possible. 
 
Dominant species of copepods were determined as 
follows (Hosokawa et al., 1968): 
  
Dominant species Ni > (1/S) Σ Ni 
 
where Ni indicates the number of ith species, and S 
means total number of species.  Similarity indices 
among each station were calculated to access the 
copepod assemblages.  Then a Percent Similarity 
Index (PSI) was adopted as follows (Schoener, 
1970): 
 
PSI = 1.0 – 0.5Σ | Pij – Phj | 
 
where Pij and Phj mean the ratio of species j at 
station i and h, respectively.  Based on the PSI, 
cluster analysis was done by a single linkage 
clustering method. 
 
Results 
 
Hydrography  
 
In mid-April, water shallower than 20 m depth was 
occupied by less saline Okhotsk Surface Water 
(OSW) indicated by salinity of < 32.5 (Fig. 2). Cold 
Intermediate Water (CIW) underlying the OSW was 
recognized in which water temperature was less than 
2°C and salinity was around 33.0 at stations beyond 
O33. Water temperature at Stns. O31 and O32 
reached 8–10°C in early June, coinciding with high 
saline water, the Soya Warm Current (SWC), having 
a salinity of >33.6. CIW was found at stations 
beyond O34.  Water temperature in coastal areas 
increased 10 to 14°C in late July. The SWC was 
found below 10 m depth at Stn. O32. CIW occupied 
the layer below about 40 m depth at stations beyond 
O33. Throughout the investigations, the fronts of the 
CIW were observed between Stns. O32 and O33 in 
mid-April and late July, and between Stns. O33 and 
O34 in early June. 
 
Total zooplankton abundance and copepod 
dominance 
 
The maximum of total zooplankton abundances 
(1,864 inds. m
–3
) was found at Stn. O31 in early 
June, and the minimum (43 inds. m
–3
) was observed 
at Stn. O35 also in early June (Fig. 3).  Average 
abundances decreased toward July. Throughout the 
investigations, copepods occupied more than 90% of 
the composition, except for at Stn. O31 in early June 
and late July when Cladocera or Appendiculata were 
predominant at the coastal stations.  Twenty genera 
and twenty five species could be identified, except 
for one calaniod species (Table 1).  Copepods were 
composed of mostly cold water species.  In these 
species, seven species such as Neocalanus spp. other 
than Neocalanus cristatus, Pseudocalanus minutus, 
Pseudocalanus newmani, Metridia pacifica, 
M. okhotensis, Acartia longiremis and Oithona 
similis were determined as dominant species 
throughout investigations.

Species composition and assemblages of copepods 
in relation to hydrography 
 
Average abundances of copepods were the highest in 
mid-April, in spite of extremely low abundances at 
Stns. O33 and O35 (Fig. 4a).  P. newmani made up 
80–87% at Stns. O31 and O32 in mid-April (Fig. 4b). 
M. pacifica, M. okhotensis and Neocalanus spp. were 
the main components at stations beyond O33. 
M. pacifica made up 46% at Stn. O33 and 68% at 
Stn. O36, respectively. M. okhotensis occupied 67% 
at Stn. O34 and 30% at Stn. O36, respectively.  
P. n e w m a n i dominated from Stns. O31 to O33 in 
early June, and it made up 62–91% of total copepod 
abundances. M. pacifica and M. okhotensis were 
predominant in addition to P. newmani at Stns. O34 
and O35.  The composition of M. okhotensis reached 
94% at Stn. O36.  A. longiremis made up 93% at Stn. 
O31 in late July. P. newmani was predominant in 
addition to A. longiremis at Stn. O32.  At stations 
beyond O33, M. okhotensis dominated, making up 
30–70% of total copepod abundances. 
 
As a result of cluster analysis based on PSI, three 
assemblages were recognized by fitting a 0.5 PSI in 
each month (Fig. 5).  At the boundary front of CIW, 
one assemblage (assemblage 1) in mid-April and 
early June, and two assemblages (assemblages 1 and 
2) in late July were observed in the coastal stations. 
These groups were composed of P. newmani or 
A. longiremis ( cf., Fig. 4b). Two assemblages 
(assemblages 2 and 3) were observed in mid-April 
and early June (Fig. 5).  In these assemblages, at 
stations far from the front (assemblage 3), the main 
components were M. okhotensis or M. pacifica ( cf., 
Fig. 4b). Dominant species in assemblage 2 consisted 
of mixtures with assemblages 1 and 3 (cf., Fig. 4b).  
Although M. okhotensis was one of the dominant 
species in assemblage 3 in late July, P. newmani was 
also an important component in this group (cf., Fig. 
4b). Because P. newmani was predominant in 
assemblage 2 in late July, the species composition of 
assemblage 3 might be mixed with assemblage 2. 
 
Figure 6 shows the abundances of dominant species 
in each month.  At the boundary of the CIW, the 
distributional characteristics are divided into three 
types.  The coastal type composed of P . newmani and 
A. longiremis tended to distribute clearly in coastal 
areas.  Four species, such as Neocalanus spp., 
P. m i n u t u s , M. pacifica and O. similis distributed in 
both coastal and pelagic stations, although two 
species of Neocalanus spp. and P. minutus were 
abundant in coastal stations in middle April. 
Distributions of M. okhotensis were limited beyond 
the front, and contributed to pelagic type.  
 
Discussion 
 
Different water properties, such as the Soya Warm 
Current (SWC), less saline Okhotsk Surface Water 
(OSW) and the Cold Intermediate Water (CIW) are 
known in the Okhotsk Sea (Takizawa, 1982).  The 
dynamics of the SWC from spring to summer 
affected zooplankton variability along nearshore 
waters of the Okhotsk Sea, eastern Hokkaido (Asami

et al., 2007). Although some studies have dealt with 
the vertical and horizontal distributions of 
zooplankton in the Okhotsk Sea (Vinogradov, 1954; 
Takeuchi, 1972), there is little information for the 
horizontal distributions of zooplankton related to the 
CIW. The present study suggests that spatial 
distributions of copepods in offshore areas relate to 
the extension of the CIW.  At the boundary of the 
front of the CIW, P. newmani was the most abundant 
copepod in coastal areas.  In the Oyashio region of 
southwestern Hokkaido, P. newmani peaked in 
abundances after the spring blooms emerged and 
abundances decreased when water temperature 
reached 15°C (Yamaguchi and Shiga, 1997).  Since 
the abundances of P. newmani decreased when 
coastal water temperature reached >14°C in this 
study, seasonal distributions of P. newmani might 
strongly depend on water temperature. Neocalanus 
spp., P. minutus, M. pacifica and O. similis were 
dominant species in assemblages mixed with coastal 
and pelagic assemblages.  Among these species, the 
seasonal distributions of Neocalanus spp. and 
P. minutus seemed to relate to the movements of the 
SWC because these species tended to be abundant in 
coastal areas in mid-April when the SWC did not 
appear.  However their distributions shifted toward 
pelagic areas when the SWC was found in the coastal 
areas in early June and late July. Neocalanus spp. are 
known as the important prey organisms of juvenile 
chum salmon (Simenstad and Salo, 1982; Nagata et 
al., 2007).  Spatial distributions of Neocalanus spp. 
may be important factors in taking account of the 
offshore migrations of juvenile chum salmon.  
 
M. okhotensis was the most dominant species and 
appeared in pelagic areas affected by the CIW during 
the investigations.  According to the reviews by 
Pinchuk and Paul (2000), M. okhotensis distributed 
in the depth below thermocline where water 
temperature decreased from 10 to 0°C sharply in 
northern Okhotsk Sea in summer.  The fine vertical 
distribution related to the CIW must be also studied 
in southern Okhotsk Sea along Hokkaido.  Biomass 
of M. okhotensis occupied more than 30 to 80% 
during spring to summer (Asami et al., unpublished 
data). Since M. okhotensis also makes active diel 
vertical migrations (Vinogradov, 1954; Hattori, 
1989), it is thought that M. okhotensis plays an 
important role in carbon dynamics of ecosystems, 
and more detailed research efforts are required in the 
Okhotsk Sea.

Abstract 
 
Based on the vertical stratified zooplankton samples collected during the autumns (September–December) of 
1996 to 1998, vertical distribution, biomass, and community structure of zooplankton and calanoid copepods 
in the southern Okhotsk Sea were evaluated and compared with those of the same period in the Oyashio 
region.  In terms of fauna, zooplankton in the Okhotsk Sea are similar to that in the Oyashio region.  However, 
their biomass, community structure and vertical distribution patterns are quite different between these two 
regions.  Zooplankton biomass near the surface layer (0 m to thermocline) in the Okhotsk Sea was less than 
that of the Oyashio region.  To understand the reason for this, we look at the distribution of large copepods in 
the mesopelagic layer in the Okhotsk Sea (this is epipelagic in the Oyashio region).  Standing stocks of most 
zooplankton taxa were smaller in the Okhotsk Sea, while only the copepod Metridia okhotensis showed an 
opposite pattern.  The abundance of M. okhotensis in the Okhotsk Sea was 30 times greater than that in 
Oyashio region, and they predominated (60% of the total copepod number) in the Okhotsk Sea.  The 
development of a strong pycnocline in the Okhotsk Sea may be a key feature responsible for these regional 
differences in the zooplankton community in the Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio region. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
The Okhotsk Sea is known to be the lowest latitude 
sea to be ice covered in winter.  Two factors 
contribute to the special characteristics of the 
Okhotsk Sea.  The first one is in physical 
oceanography.  There is the development of a strong 
pycnocline below which near-zero temperature cold 
intermediate water is present (Kitani, 1973).  The 
second factor is related to biological oceanography.  
Juveniles of Japanese salmon born in a given year 
are known to migrate to the Okhotsk Sea for feeding 
in summer (Ueno and Ishida, 1996).  Both these 
factors are considered to affect the abundance and 
distribution of zooplankton.   
 
To clarify the characteristics of the zooplankton 
community in the Okhotsk Sea, we studied the 
vertical distribution of biomass, copepod community 
structure, population structure and body sizes and 
compared the results with those in the adjacent 
Pacific (Oyashio region).   
 
Methods 
 
In the present study, two types of samplings were 
made.  The first one was stratified sampling between 
0 and 2000 m depth using a closing net (Fig. 1, open 
circles).  The second one was stratified sampling 
between 0 to 500 m depth using the IONESS system, 
which is a version of MOCNESS (solid circles).  
Stratified sampling at the IONESS stations was made 
four times per day to evaluate diel changes in vertical 
distribution.

All of the samplings were conducted between 
September and December from 1996–1998.  Results 
were compared assuming that inter-annual changes 
were minimum.  To estimate biomass, the settling 
volume was measured for closing net samples.  To 
determine the community structure, major 
zooplankton taxa and species, and stages of calanoid 
copepods were identified and quantified.  Results 
were tested to find out whether inter-oceanic 
differences were present or not.    
 
Hydrography 
 
Temperature data are shown in Figure 2 for the 
closing net and IONESS stations.  In the Okhotsk 
Sea, cold intermediate water is observed below the 
pycnocline.  One station reached below 0°C.  Since 
this study was conducted in autumn, this negative 
temperature was considered to be formed in the 
winter of the previous year.  In the Oyashio region, 
there was no cold intermediate water.  No station 
registered below 2°C in the Oyshio region (Fig. 2).   
 
Biomass 
 
The vertical distribution of zooplankton biovolume is 
shown in Table 1.  In the Oyashio region, the highest 
biomass was commonly observed in the surface layer 
(0 m to thermocline) while in the Okhotsk Sea, it was 
commonly observed in the 250–500 m depth strata.  
Significant differences were noted only in the surface 
layer, where the zooplankton biomass in the surface 
layer of the Okhotsk Sea was lower than that in the 
Oyashio region by a factor of 1/4.  Since there was 
no variation in the rest of the water column (Tc–2000 
m depth), the biomass also did not vary (Table 1). 
 
Taxonomic content 
 
Thirteen taxa and 34 calanoid copepods were 
identified from the samples collected by IONESS.  
Of these, 6 taxa and 7 calanoid copepod species 
showed significant differences in abundance between 
the regions.  Six taxa: Amphipoda, Appendicularia,

Chaetognatha, Poecilostomatoida, Polychaeta, 
Mollusca, and 6 calanoid copepods: Eucalanus bungii, 
Metridia pacifica, Neocalanus cristatus, 
Pleuromamma scutullata, Pseudocalanus minutus and 
P. newmani were more abundant in the Oyashio 
region.  Only one calanoid copepod, Metridia 
okhotensis, showed greater abundance in the Okhotsk 
Sea, by a factor of 30 times (9369 inds. m
–2
 in the 
Okhotsk Sea vs. 367 inds. m
–2
 in the Oyashio region).   
 
Since calanoid copepods were the predominant 
component of the zooplankton community (>80%) in 
both regions, the species compositions of calanoid 
copepods were further analyzed (Fig. 3).  In the 
Oyashio region, the most dominant copepods were 
Metridia pacifica, followed by Eucalanus bungii, 
Pseudocalanus mintus, P. newmani, Neocalanus 
plumchrus and M. okhotensis, which was similar to 
the patterns of the both the western and eastern 
subarctic Pacific (cf., Goldblatt et al., 1999; Ikeda et 
al., 2008).  In the Okhotsk Sea, M. okhotensis was 
the predominant component and accounted for 66% 
of the total copepod abundance.  Since the 
composition of M. okhotensis was only 0.9% of the 
total copepod abundance in the Oyashio region, the 
anomalously high abundance of M. okhotensis in the 
Okhotsk Sea is considered to be a special 
characteristic of copepod communities in the 
Okhotsk Sea.

communities in the Okhotsk Sea (upper) and Oyashio 
region (lower). 
 
Summary 
 
Low zooplankton biomass in the epipelagic layer of 
the Okhotsk Sea was evident when comparing the 
Okhotsk Sea and adjacent Oyashio region.  This was 
partly because of the low abundance of the most of 
zooplankton taxa and calanoid copepod species.  
Only the calanoid copepod Metridia okhotensis was 
the predominant component of the open area of the 
Okhotsk Sea.  The Metridia species is known to be a 
strong diel vertical migrant (Hays, 1995).  Both the 
low zooplankton biomass in the epipelagic layer and 
strong migrant capabilities of the Metridia species 
suggests that the development of a strong pycnocline 
and the presence of cold intermediate water play a 
key role in the distribution of the zooplankton 
community in the Okhotsk Sea.  Since development 
of a pycnocline is greater in the Okhotsk Sea, it may 
prevent diel vertical migration of most zooplankton 
taxa (= low biomass in the epipelagic layer).  The 
dominance of the strong migrant species Metridia 
suggests that M. okhotensis can cross the strong 
pycnocline and cold intermediate layer in the 
Okhotsk Sea.   
 
Future Prospects 
 
Since Metridia okhotensis is the predominant 
component of the open area of the Okhotsk Sea, 
future study should focus on the ecology of this 
species.  A time-series of zooplankton samples 
collected at Rausu (face towards the Okhotsk Sea) 
located on Shiretoko Peninsula, Japan, at 350 m 
depth (Shiretoko Rausu Deep-Seawater) is being 
examined.  Here, M. okhotensis also dominates (ca. 
50% of calanoid copepod abundance; Yamaguchi, 
unpublished data).  From this analysis, we are 
planning to reveal the life cycle of M. okhotensis in 
the open area of the Okhotsk Sea.

Introduction 
 
Because natural organisms are a part of the factors 
constituting the ecosystem for each organism, it is 
important to clarify both physical and biological 
exploitable factors to determine species compositions 
which exist in that ecosystem.  The variation in 
factors which constitute an ecosystem makes up the 
variation in species composition.  At the same time, 
each species will interact and will make a dynamic 
ecosystem. 
 
The Abashiri River is one of the longest rivers in 
eastern Hokkaido and flows into the Okhotsk Sea.  
Its drainage area is over 1380 km
2
 and various types 
of environment are found along the river; i.e., intact 
natural vegetation upriver, lots of farmland in the 
middle section and residential areas downriver.  Such 
variations in the environment around the river affect 
the ecosystem in the river. 
 
In the Abashiri River basin, rainbow trout were 
introduced after World War II.  Some individuals 
settled in certain places of the river basin but were 
not able to settle in other parts of it.  Alien species 
are one of the big interests in conservation biology.  
It is important to understand the difference in habitat 
requirements between alien and indigenous species 
in order to help control the number of alien species.  
In previous studies, analyses were independent of 
each species and there was a lack of analyses to 
determine the interaction among them. 
 
Generalized Linear Models (GLM: Nelder and 
Wedderburn, 1972) allow for the variation of error 
distribution that includes multinomial distribution.  
GLMs are useful for finding out what factors will 
present the composition of fish species by a model 
selection method using information criteria.  In this 
study, we evaluate a preliminary method to clarify 
the composition of fish species using a GLM with 
multinomial error distribution. 
 
Materials and Method 
  
Fish species and environmental data were gathered 
between June and November in 2007, at least once per 
each month for a total of 7 times.  We set 5 survey 
areas (A1, A2, A3, H and K) in the upper reaches of 
Abashiri River (Fig. 1).  Each survey area measured 
100 m in length.  We caught fishes using an electric 
fisher (Smith-Root Co., Model 12-b, DC100-1, 100V, 
Max 60A).  We recorded pH, water temperature and 
water depth at 6 points (3 points upstream and 3 points 
downstream) in each survey location.

June to November 2007.

244  PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
To clarify the explaining factors determining the 
composition of fish species, we used a GLM with 
multinomial error distribution (Araki, 2007).  We 
used an average of 6 data points recorded in each 
survey location as environmental factors.  Location 
name and month were the other explaining factors.  
So the initial model becomes 
  
   composition of fish species   
 = a
1
 p + a
2
 t + a
3
 d  + a
4
 m + a
5
 l + ε.   
 
Here, a
i
, p, t, d, m and l are the coefficients of each 
explaining variable, pH, water temperature, water 
depth, month and survey location, respectively, and  
ε is an error variable followed by a multinomial 
distribution.  We used a step-wise procedure with 
both directions (Burnham and Anderson, 2002) 
setting a Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) as the 
estimating value to evaluate an optimal model and to 
find out which factors affect the composition of fish 
species.  After getting the optimal model, if 
categorical explaining variables (i.e., month and 
survey location) were selected, we clustered 
categorical explaining variables by using BIC as 
estimating values. 
 
We then evaluated how the model would predict fish 
species composition.  Two criteria provided by Sato 
(2002) were applied for this evaluation.  The first 
criterion was the proportion that when a species ‘A’ 
is observed and predicted one is correct.  This means 
the predicted performance for an occurrence ratio.  
The second criterion was the proportion when an 
observed species is not A and predicted one is not A 
either.  This means the predicted performance for a 
non-occurrence ratio.  If these criteria are high, it 
means this model can figure out a real situation well.  
We calculated these criteria for three main species, 
masu-salmon (Oncorhynchus masou), white spotted 
char (Salvelinus leucomaenis) and a kind of loach 
(Noemacheilus barbatulus toni). 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
Catch 
 
There were 5 fish families containing 7 species in the 
catch.  The catch for each species is shown in 
Table 1. 
 
Optimal model 
  
For the optimal model, variables of water 
temperature (t) and survey location (l) were selected.  
Survey locations grouped into 3 clusters, i.e., A1 + 
H, A2 + A3 and K.  The estimated values of each 
species were compared to Salvelinus leucomaenis 
(A) which was given the value 0.  The coefficients 
and standard errors of the survey locations were 
compared to that of A2 + A3.  Each estimated 
coefficient and standard error are shown in Table 2 
and 3, respectively. 
 
Looking at Table 2, we see that if the estimated value 
for various species is positive, it means the variable 
tested is more favorable for an individual of that 
species compared to white spotted char.  If the value 
increases, the number of fish increases.  So, sculpin 
prefer A1 + H more than other species and Japanese 
dace prefer K.  Japanese dace prefer the lowest 
temperatures compared to other species.  However, if 
the standard error is higher, the confidence interval 
will become larger.

Water temperature was the only environmental 
variable, except survey location, used to explain fish 
species composition.  The survey location variable 
may represent all other factors which we did not set in 
the initial model.  So we cannot say that fish species 
composition depends on only water temperature.  
However, we found it is one of the most important 
habitat requirements.  White spotted char especially 
favor a habitat of lower temperature compared to the 
other species.  This fits to the results of a former study 
(Nakamura, 2007).  Rainbow trout favor warmer 
locations compared to other salmonids.  The cluster of 
survey locations was found to be appropriate because 
the clusters shared similar physical relationships, i.e., 
upriver cluster (A1 + H), middle river cluster (A2 + 
A3) and tributary river (K). 
   
The model performed well for masu-salmon and a 
kind of loach, but not for white spotted char 
(Table 4).  This could be because we used a simple 
model without any interacting terms among the 
variables.  In addition, the niches of masu-salmon 
and white spotted char overlapped in many situations 
and the number of white spotted char was less than 
for masu salmon.  This may make it hard to 
distinguish the habitat preference of white spotted 
char.  Our study shows such a possibility, and 
modification of the initial model is required in a 
future study. 
  
The methodology used to predict habitat 
requirements was provided, and the selected model is 
appropriate.  Except for white spotted char, the 
optimal model can predict fish species fairly well. 
  
This is still a preliminary study and we need to 
improve our selection of explaining variables to be 
included in the initial model. However, we believe 
this type of approach will provide an objective model 
to explain habitat requirements of fish species.  For 
the analysis of ecosystems, we recommend adopting 
this type of strategy because if there are various 
factors constituting an ecosystem, this type of 
analysis is the only way to get appropriate results.

Introduction 
 
A joint research project, the Hanasaki Program, 
conducted by Nemuro City and Sakhalin Research 
Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography 
(SakhNIRO), is in its fifth year.  Although the 
program is small, it has a large scientific scope and 
has identified several important pieces of scientific 
evidence and posed new scientific questions.  Thus, 
we would like to present them as potential items for 
the Okhotsk Sea component of the new PICES 
integrative science program on Forecasting and 
Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of 
North Pacific Ecosystems (FUTURE).  
 
What is the Hanasaki Program? 
 
The Hanasaki Program is a program dedicated to the 
study of Hanasaki crab, Paralithodes brevipes, which 
is distributed mainly around the Nemuro Peninsula, 
once called the Hanasaki Peninsula, in the waters 
around Hokkaido, Japan. Hanasaki crab is the 
symbolic sea food of Nemuro City because of its 
brilliant red color when boiled, and its vivid taste. 
However, the catch of this crab has been very low in 
spite of stock management and enhancement efforts. 
Moreover, the Nemuro market, among other 
Hokkaido fisheries markets in recent years, has been 
supplied with Hanasaki crab landings as well as by 
illegal catches from the Okhotsk Sea and nearby 
waters. 
 
The Hanasaki Program is addressing the following 
questions which have a broad scientific scope 
covering biology, ecology, oceanography, ecosystem 
modeling, fisheries management, culturing 
technology, and taste quality.  
Why does stock not recover in spite of stock 
management efforts? Is it due to: 
– Illegal catch?  
 Action: identify the unit of stock management. 
– Overestimation of abundance resulting in too 
large of an allowable catch?  
Action: review the stock assessment method 
and develop a tagging method. 
– Abundance of settling larvae?  
Action: conduct a joint larval survey. 
 
2) How can the culturing method be improved? 
– How can the mass mortality in seed 
production be avoided?  
Action: conduct a comparative parallel test 
on possible alternative measures. 
  
3) How can the value of stock in the market be 
realized and enhanced? 
– When is the best taste season and where is the 
best place to find the best tasting crab? 
Action: monitor the changes in taste through 
the seasons and between sites by conducting 
organoleptic tests. 
– Is the molting phase linked to taste?  
Action: examine changes in the umami 
relating chemical components through the 
molting process. 
 
The five following themes were developed to address 
these questions, and four years after the program was 
implemented, the following results have been 
obtained by the Nemuro and SakhNIRO teams.  
 
Major Achievements of Research  
 
Theme 1.  Study on the dynamics of the P. 
brevipes fishery and population 
 
Objectives and research items 
  
• To identify hidden problems in stock management 
practice through an overview of fishery 
operations and catch dynamics; 
• To review if the appropriate level of allowable 
catch has been set or not; 
• To develop tags to be retained through multiple 
moltings for the estimation of stock abundance, 
mortality and emigration/immigration;  
• To elucidate the effects of the environment on 
stock dynamics through investigation of seasonal 
changes in water temperature of the fishing 
grounds;  
Biological processes/Disturbances by oil and gas development 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  247 
• To know the status of local populations of 
P. brevipes distributed in the Okhotsk Sea and 
adjacent waters by looking at: 
1) Features of the fishery and catch efficiency of 
crab pots; 
2) Improvement of stock assessment and 
development of tagging methods; 
3) Oceanographic conditions and structures; 
4) Status of local populations. 
 
Results 
 
1) Features of the fishery and catch efficiency of 
crab pots 
Catch efficiency of crab pots 
Nemuro 
Results of past surveys showed that: 
• The attracting range of crab pots was 
estimated to be between 9 and 12 m; the 
maximum number of crabs in a pot was 
estimated to be around 5 individuals; and the 
duration of pot immersion to maximize crab 
catch was about 3 days; 
• Selectivity of pot cover nets by crabs 
indicated no significant difference in 
carapace size composition for meshes of 30, 
60, and 120 mm (Fig. 1).

and 120 mm mesh using 30 mm mesh catch as reference.

SakhNIRO 
Diving results showed that: 
• P. brevipes in crab pots stuck to the inside of 
the side net, or at the outside of the crab pots, 
attached to the bottom of the pot, or stuck 
outside or close to the net wall, crowding 
together in two or three tight rows, as if 
waiting in the turn to enter the pot;  
• Within a distance of 10 m from the pots, 
groups of 2 to 3 individuals hid under brown 
algae, at the bottom of protruding rocks, or in 
the cracks of rocks;  
• At a distance of 15 to 20 m, crabs were 
distributed as single individuals;  
• Beyond 20 m from the pots, no crabs were 
observed;  
• Just after molting, P. brevipes showed high 
feeding activity at the crab pots and, at night, 
moved actively to form local swarms; the pot 
catch in the survey area showed sudden 
jumps at various points.   
 
2) Improvement of stock assessment and development 
of tagging methods   
Improvement of stock assessment methods 
Nemuro 
• A review of the present method for P. brevipes 
stock assessment indicated a large uncertainty 
resulting from peculiarities in catch efficiency 
of the crab pots. The major source of 
uncertainty causing an overestimation of stock 
was the individual number-based catch–
density relation. In other words, stock 
estimation by the CPUE–density relation at 
around a saturation level of gear capacity can 
cause a larger uncertainty and possible 
overestimation of stock density, especially 
when the size dependency of the gear 
saturation level is ignored in the CPUE–
density relation.  
Development of tagging methods  
Nemuro 
• Tagging was one of the most efficient 
methods for field surveys of population 
dynamics. However, in the case of 
crustaceans, tags had a tendency to drop off 
with the old carapace at the time of molting, 
and the duration of the tagging survey was 
limited to a short interval between molting.  
The straight-type anchor tag (Photo 1) and 
marking by making an excision on the side of 
the carapace (Photo 2) were tested, and 
confirmed that tag retention after the fifth 
molting was a highly practicable method for 
P. brevipes.

• The inner membrane taken from a chip 
excised from the side of the carapace for 
marking has proven to be useful for DNA 
analysis, and the possibility of a tag mark 
with DNA information for individual 
identification is being developed. 
 
3) Oceanographic conditions and structures  
Nemuro 
• Water temperature of fishing grounds near 
the bottom was monitored for 3 years. The 
very special nature of seasonal changes of 
oceanic conditions there (not changes in 
vertical structure but changes in horizontal 
shore–offshore structures) was clarified. 
These changes appear to continue to offshore 
oceanic conditions such as the Coastal 
Oyashio and the East Hokkaido Warm 
Current; 
• Seasonal variations of the East Hokkaido 
Coastal Current were investigated. Results 
showed that the outflow of Okhotsk Sea 
Water does not influence the East Hokkaido 
Coastal Current Water.  The water would 
have been greatly modified before it reached 
the sea to the east off Hokkaido.  The results 
support the conclusion of DNA analysis on 
the genetic difference between the Sakhalin-
Shiretoko populaton and the Kuril-Nemuro-
Erimo population.   
 
(For details, please refer to the paper by Nagata 
in these proceedings.) 
 
SakhNIRO 
• Downwelling was observed and measured in 
the aggregation areas of P.brevipes larvae 
and adults; 
• From the spatial distribution of temperature 
and salinity, a pair of cyclonic and anti-
cyclonic eddies were identified in the South 
Kuril Strait which showed that the current 
field is favorable for retention of planktonic 
larvae; 
• The Princeton Oceanographic Model (POM) 
approach applied to P. brevipes larval 
distribution in the study area was confirmed 
by field surveys, except in shallow waters 
around Nemuro Strait and its vicinities.  
 
4) Status of local populations 
 
SakhNIRO 
• Aggregations of P. brevipes in the coastal 
waters of the South Kuril Islands were in a 
good state. Survey results on planktonic 
larvae indicated a high level of reproduction 
in the region;  
• However, in the 2005 and 2006 surveys, many 
females with unfertilized eggs were sampled; 
• Diving surveys in 2004 determined the 
habitat of P. brevipes and population 
densities in the embayments around the 
islands of Shikotan, Yuriy, Zeleniy, and 
Polonskiy; 
• A survey on the distribution of P. brevipes in 
the coastal area from Cape Odyan to the 
eastern boundary of the northern Okhotsk Sea 
was performed. Results showed that the 
spatial distribution of P. brevipes is uneven. 
The crab is confined specifically to the shoal 
area, and along the broken coastline there are 
several isolated spots with dense 
congregations of P. brevipes where high 
catches of commercial individuals have been 
obtained (MagadanNIRO); 
• A survey of P. brevipes on the eastern 
Kamchatka shelf was performed. As there is 
no demand for P. brevipes on the domestic 
market, this stock is not exploited by 
commercial fisheries.  In some areas, small-
sized crabs are dominant (KamchatNIRO); 
• Surveys of the P. brevipes population along 
the eastern coast of Terpeniya Peninsula, on 
Sakhalin Island, identified stable abundant 
colonies of this crab.  Molting was observed 
mainly from the last 10 days of July to the 
first 10 days of August. Fecundity averaged 
40,000 eggs for crabs with average carapace 
width of 104 mm (SakhNIRO); 
 
Future study 
 
1) Features of the fishery and catch efficiency of 
crab pots 
Catch efficiency of crab pots  
• Determine the saturation point of crab pots 
under different carapace size composition, 
and the relation between the pot escapement 
rate and size of crab.

2) Improvement of stock assessment and 
development of tagging methods 
 Improvement of stock assessment 
• Improve methods of obtaining fishery data, 
especially on fishing locations and size 
composition of catch. 
Development of tagging methods  
• Implement field tests and practical 
applications. 
 
3) Oceanographic conditions and structures 
Nemuro 
• Determine the relationship between seasonal 
changes in bottom temperature of fishing 
grounds and catches; 
• Increase efforts to obtain direct current 
measurement data; 
• Develop CTD and hydro-chemical data 
archives.  
SakhNIRO 
• Understand the possible causes of 
downwelling (by examining the possibility of 
a secondary flow by residual currents in the 
vertical section), and the current structure; 
• Understand the formation mechanism of 
eddies in the South Kuril Strait (including the 
possibility of tidal residual currents) and their 
seasonal variability; 
• Perform seasonal and interannual water 
property monitoring by remote sensing and in 
situ measurements.    
 
4) Status of local populations 
 
• Understand the genetic relationship between 
the Sakhalin population and the population at 
the northern coast of the Okhotsk Sea; the 
relationship between the distribution area and 
the area of circulation formed by the East 
Sakhalin Current and offshore countercurrent 
during the warm period of the year; the 
spatial difference in size composition within 
the distribution area and distribution of 
recruitment; 
• Understand the genetic relationship between 
the eastern Kamchatka and Sakhalin 
populations; the relationship between the 
distribution area and the area of circulation 
formed by the Northern Okhotsk Current and 
its countercurrent; the spatial difference in 
size composition within the distribution area 
and distribution of recruitment. 
 
Theme 2.  Study of ecology and population 
structure of P. brevipes 
 
Objectives and research items 
 
• To elucidate the independency and mutual 
interchange among local populations, through 
DNA analyses, for identifying a strategy for stock 
management and stock recovery; 
• To elucidate the ecology of crab;  
• To develop an ecosystem model on larval 
transport and survival processes by looking at: 
1) Genetic diversity and population structure;  
2) Transport and dispersion of planktonic larvae;  
3) Field survey of planktonic larvae;  
4) Ecological study.  
 
Results 
 
1) Genetic diversity and population structure  
Nemuro 
• Novel DNA markers (eight microsatellite 
DNA and mtDNA AT-rich regions) were 
used to assess the genetic variability and 
population structure of P. brevipes (Fig. 2);  
• Both microsatellite DNA and mtDNA 
analyses suggested that the populations of 
Sakhalin-Shiretoko, Kamchatka, and South 
Kuril-Nemuro-Erimo are genetically different;

• The population on the coast of Nemuro 
Peninsula had high genetic variability and is 
clearing the critical level of effective 
population size (Ne) of 500 for keeping 
genetic variability of the population and 
preventing extinction;  
• Artificial seeds produced by Nemuro City 
had relatively high genetic variability 
compared to the natural population;  
• A new DNA typing method for future tag-
and-release surveys was established without 
harming the individual and commercial value 
of the crab;  
• Groups of P. brevipes in the Nemuro 
Peninsula–east of Cape Erimo area and in the 
South Kuril waters had minimum genetic 
differences and probably belong to the same 
population. Greater differences were obtained 
between the Sakhalin and northwest coast of 
Shiretoko Peninsula populations and 
Kamchatka populations (Fig. 3). 
 
2) Transport and dispersion of planktonic larvae 
Nemuro 
Results of numerical simulations (POM) clarify 
the following: 
• Planktonic larvae of Sakhalin origin reach the 
coast of Hokkaido Island to at least north of 
the Shiretoko Peninsula;  
• Seasonal variability of the East Sakhalin 
Current and Soya Current plays an important 
role in the settlement of planktonic Sakhalin- 
originating larvae;  
• The recruitment of crab must be influenced 
by interannual variability of oceanic 
conditions, especially surface currents and 
sea surface temperature around the Nemuro 
coast and Okhotsk Sea coast of Japan;  
• The South Kuril waters around Malaya 
Kurilskaya Gryada and Nemuro Bay were 
identified as the most possible settling sites 
for larvae;  
• An anti-cyclonic eddy in the South Kuril 
Strait may play an important role in the 
retention and accumulation of larvae. 
 
3) Field survey of planktonic larvae  
Nemuro 
• Stations where planktonic larvae were 
sampled were mainly on the south side of the 
Nemuro Peninsula (Fig. 4, Table 1); the 
number of larvae sampled were considerably 
fewer than those sampled in the waters of the 
South Kuril Strait by SakhNIRO; 
• In the 2007 and 2008 surveys, no P. brevipes 
larvae were sampled from Nemuro Strait;  
• P. brevipes larvae appeared early, suggesting 
early shifting of the hatch-out time due to the 
effects of regional warming (Fig. 5).

SakhNIRO 
• May–June distribution density of planktonic 
larvae of P. brevipes in the waters around the 
South Kuril Islands was high and varied from 
10s to 100s of individuals/m
2
. 
 
4) Ecological study  
Nemuro 
• From previous research conducted by 
Torisawa et al. (1999), the growth curve was 
re-examined to overcome the difference 
between early growth obtained through 
rearing individuals (Kittaka and Onoda, 
2002) and that obtained through examination 
of wild samples (Abe and Koike, 1982; 
Sasaki and Yoshida, 1999).  By synthesizing 
past results, a new age–carapace width–
length relation was proposed (Torisawa, 
2005); 
• Molting of P. brevipes was observed during 
culturing studies; 
• Results of laboratory measurements on the 
phototaxis swimming speed of larvae were 
introduced as an important parameter for 
larval transport model experiments. 
  
SakhNIRO 
• The diet of male king crab (Paralithodes 
camtschaticus), Hanasaki crab (also known as 
red spiny crab) (Paralithodes brevipes) and 
golden king crab (Liathodes aequispinus) 
near the South Kuril Islands were compared; 
Sea urchins of genus Strongylocentrotus 
prevailed in the diet of these three crabs; 
90.8% for L. aequispinus, 84.1% for P. 
brevipes, and 53.8% for P. camtschaticus; 
High stomach fullness of P. brevipes was 
recorded only near the Malaya Kurilskaya 
Gryada between 19 and 48 m depth. 
 
Future study 
 
1) Genetic diversity and population structure 
• Study the genetic diversity and population 
structure of P. brevipes in the waters of 
northern and eastern parts of the Okhotsk 
Sea, Kuril Islands, Kamchatka and Bering 
Sea (Fig. 6).  
 
2) Transport and dispersion of planktonic larvae  
 
• Using the POM approach to validate the 
model and examine the factors controlling 
distribution of the larvae, a biological 
oceanographic database on the habitat of  
P. brevipes larvae is needed (Fig. 7):  
– A GIS-oriented approach should be used;  
– Because of a lack of initial data in the 
region, including a deficiency of chemical 
materials, new specific and task-oriented 
field/database/model studies will be 
needed in the coming 1–2 years; 
– Intergovernmental efforts would be 
productive and helpful for the joint 
development of a biological oceanographic 
database, its implementation and scientific 
publication;   
• Problems to resolve: 
– Obtain Russian and Japanese governmental 
approvals for joint research; 
– Establish a task team; 
– Look for funding;

• In order to identify the hatching-out sites and 
settling sites of P. brevipes larvae from the 
results of field larval surveys, a modeling 
study on larval transport in the South Kuril 
waters has been implemented by a local 
physical oceanography model.  An example 
of output bottom concentration of P. brevipes 
larvae (without other zooplankton) is shown 
in Figure 8; 
• In this example, P. brevipes larvae are 
settling in the southern part of Nemuro Strait, 
while no individuals were sampled during  
field surveys by the Nemuro team.  Further 
improvements need to be made to the model 
and field survey. 
 
3) Field survey of planktonic larvae  
• Propose a joint international Japan–Russia 
expedition for a larval survey in the southern 
Okhotsk Sea and its vicinities to be executed 
by one or two research vessels in May–June, 
2008, or later.  The proposed sampling plan is 
shown below (Fig. 9). 
 
4) Ecological study 
• Conduct ecological and muscle physiology 
studies on molting;  
• Perform rearing tests on recovery from 
molting.

change of taste components; 
3) Studying methods to improve taste quality. 
 
Results 
 
1) Development of indices of freshness/liveliness 
• Energy Charge was an effective index for 
determining the liveliness of P. brevipes.

3) Methods to improve taste quality  
• Rearing in higher salinity water increased the 
taurine level in P. brevipes, which suggests a 
possible method for improving taste;  
• The recovery process after molting indicated 
that the increased water content ratio and 
taste composition were dramatically 
recovered in accordance with hardening of 
the carapace;  
• Panelists composed from staff of the 
fishermen’s cooperative evaluated the taste 
quality of P. brevipes during different stages 
of recovery from molting by organoleptic 
tests. Crab at one stage before complete 
recovery were graded relatively higher than at 
other stages;  
• The best cooking method and best time for 
flavour was boiled crab when it was still 
warm;  
• Results from chemical analyses of taste 
components indicated a degradation in part of 
the taste components by freezing or boiling;  
• A “Manual for preservation and improvement 
of taste quality of P. brevipes” was compiled 
as summary results. 
 
Future study/activity 
 
To publish a best procedure for cooking and tasting 
P. brevipes for consumers. 
 
Theme 5.  Study on the design of the P. brevipes 
fishery system for recovering and sustaining its 
resources

• To compare cost/performance of stock recovery 
measures; 
• To identify a most suitable stock management 
method;  
• To design a fishery system for establishment of a 
sustainable P. brevipes fishery.

A “Manual for selecting stock recovery measures” 
was compiled as summary results. 
 
Future study 
 
• To improve stock assessments in selecting stock 
recovery measures; 
• To arrange P. brevipes total catch information and 
exchange.

Benthos community of a dumping area during liquid natural gas 
plant construction:  Effects of technical impacts or natural changes?

Introduction 
 
According to the technical-economic substantiation 
(TES) of the Project “Sakhalin-II. Phase 2”, two 
marine exploration platforms were constructed in the 
Lunskoye and Piltun-Astohskoe oil-gas fields, and 
were connected by pipelines to an oil terminal in 
Aniva Bay (south coast of Sakhalin island) for year-
round exploration.  Another aspect of the Project 
involved a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal and 
material operations facilities (MOF) to be added to 
the LNG plant that was built in 2003–2006 on the 
Aniva Bay shore near the settlement of 
Prigorodnoye.  
 
A dredging operation needed to be carried out in the 
area of the LNG terminal and MOF beforehand in 
order to provide safe entry and mooring for ships. 
The dumping of dredged ground was approved in 
Aniva Bay outside of the 12-mile zone where water 
depth was 60–65 m.  The Project also included 
comprehensive environmental monitoring. 
 
The purpose of this research was to observe marine 
biota and the environment in the dredging and 
dumping areas in Aniva Bay.  One of the main 
monitoring tasks was to estimate the impact of 
dumping on the benthos community and to forecast 
the time needed to restore its original abundance and 
structure in the affected area. 
 
The Sakhalin Research Institute of Fisheries and 
Oceanography conducted research based on the 
Agreement with CTSD Ltd. Company.  The schedule 
of observations included the following phases: before 
dredging, during the dumping, and after the work 
was completed. 
 
Materials and Methods 
 
Benthos was sampled in August 2003 – before any 
ground dumping; in October and December 2004, in 
May and August 2005 – during the operations; in 
August 2006 and August 2007 – after all the work 
had been completed. Sampling stations were located 
at 300, 800 and 2000 m off the central dumping point 
(coordinates 46°24.5′ N latitude and 142°55.0′ E 
longitude) to the north, east, south and west. Benthos 
was sampled from the R/V Dmitry Peskov using a 
Van-Veen grab (0.2 m
2
).  
 
The following structure indices and coefficient were 
used for the assessment of state and comparison of 
benthos communities: 
1.  Index of diversity (Shennon), 
2.  Index of cenotic similarity (Shoener), 
3.  Species similarity coefficient (Serensen), 
4.  Community succession index ( АВС-method). 
 
Results 
 
Dredging and dumping operations were carried out 
from March until the middle of May and from mid-
September until December to lessen the impact on 
the environment and biological resources. 
 
In August 2003, before the dumping operation began 
in the described area, the bottom community was 
surveyed and a dominance of sipunculids (Golfingia 
margaritacea) and a significant number of 
polychaetes (Axiothella catenata, Praxillella spp., 
Prionospio sp.) were observed. There was also a high 
abundance of amphipods and cumaceans. Average 
benthos biomass was 53.7 g/m
2
 (Table 1). 
 
In December 2004, after the first phase of dumping, 
the number of species and their abundance was the 
same as in 2003 and high due to small crustaceans, 
but mean biomass was about half as much (Table 1). 
The bivalve Nuculana pernula pernula dominated in 
most of the area. Therefore, this type of community 
could be considered an indicator of dumping. 
 
In August 2005, the mean benthos biomass was high, 
reaching 48.6 g/m
2
 (Table 1); most of the biomass 
(71%) was formed by sipunculids. Almost all of 
sipunculid biomass (413 g/m
2
) was accumulated at 
the station located 2000 m west of the central 
Biological processes/Disturbances by oil and gas development

dumping point (figure not shown). The benthos 
community here can be characterized as refugial, that 
is, recovering to the pre-dumping state. At the rest of 
the stations, the sipunculid biomass was close to 
zero, and the total benthic biomass did not exceed 
36 g/m
2
. In August, benthos biomass (6.5 g/m
2
) in 
the dumping zone (within the 300 m radius), as in 
May (5.3 g/m
2
), was very low; this may be due to the 
impact of the second dumping phase on the bottom 
community. 
 
At the station located 300 m north of the dumping 
point, a high biomass of bivalves (3.5 g/m
2
) which 
was being formed by the common shallow mollusks 
Callista brevisiphonata and Turtonia minuta, was  
 
observed (figure not shown). Finding these and some 
other shallow water species, such as green algae and 
the isopod Arcturus crassispinis allows us to suppose 
that they were discharged here with the extracted 
nearshore ground. 
 
In August 2006 the mean benthos biomass was 
18.2 g/m
2
; the major portion of the biomass (69%) 
was formed by bivalves. Distribution regularities 
were observed in benthic group’s biomass. Figure 1 
shows that bivalves (Nuculana pernula pernula) 
prevailed at stations located near the dumping point 
(0–800 m to the west, east and north), and also 
2,000 m to the north of it. Correspondingly, the post-
dumping community was observed in this area.

Maximum polychaete biomass was observed at a 
distance 2,000 and 800 m to the west, and 2,000 m to 
the east and north of the dumping point (Fig. 2); 
sipunculid biomass was observed 800 m to the west 
and east of the dumping point) (Fig. 3).  Therefore, 
the bottom community at these stations could be 
characterized as refugial.  In general, high biomasses 
(from 13 to 30 g/m
2
) were observed within a radius 
of 300 m from the dumping point to the west, north 
and east.  This could be considered a result of the 
gradual restoration of bottom biota after dumping. 
The mean biomass within the radius of 300 m of the 
dumping point was 17.5 g/m
2
 which is higher than 
the indices of May and August 2005.

Next, we compare benthos structure characteristics on 
the dumping area by the study periods (Table 2). In 
August 2005 the community structure was also close 
to that of the background (pre-dumping) phase 
(August 2003); this is supported by Shennon’s index 
and the ABC-index.  The level of cenotic and species 
similarity (Serensen’s coefficient) with the 
background community was also high; this shows that 
there was a gradual recovery of the post-dumping 
benthic community similar to the background one, 
although the predominance of bivalves was 
significant.  Thus, in August 2005, the negative impact 
of dumping on the bottom community was generally 
less significant than expected, and a process of 
recovery up to the initial pre-dumping state was 
progressing rapidly.  However, 2007 data showed an 
unexpected significant change in the structure and 
quantitative characteristics of the benthos community.

Fig. 5 Nuculana pernula community distribution during 1949–2005 in Aniva Bay.  
 
 
In the radius of 300 m from the dumping point, low 
values of biomass (from 0.1 to 4 g/m
2
) were 
observed. Such a decline in biomass was connected 
to the disappearance of bivalve mollusks from the 
dumping zone. Polychaetes became the dominant 
group. Structural characteristics show that the 
benthos community characterizes a high index of 
diversity and significant stability. Hence, the bottom 
community passes to the next level of succession. 
We do not know whether this reorganization was 
influenced by the construction.  After 2005 no more 
dumping took place. 
 
We next consider the distribution of the basic benthic 
group (Bivalvia) for different periods.  Displacement 
of Nuculana sp. from the south and east to the north 
of the dumping ground from December 2004 to 
August 2007 is observed in Figure 4. 
 
We then retrospectively analyse the distribution of 
the Nuculana pernula community in Aniva Bay. 
Figure 5 is a compilation of scientific, archival and 
our own survey data which shows the long migration 
of the Nuculana pernula community from deeper 
waters near the end of Aniva Bay at the middle of 
last century to shallower waters by 2005. The 
migration is accompanied by the breakup of a united 
area into two smaller ones (in 1949 and 1965), a 
change in community structure to a level of mass 
species and decrease of its biomass.  The migration 
and changes of the Nuculana pernula community is 
accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the total 
benthic biomass.  The figure also shows that the 
dumping area is located on the border of a modern 
community. Hence, observed changes in the 
dumping area are connected to natural changes in the 
benthos. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The influence of ground dumping is traced only 
directly after impact. Later on it is masked by natural 
benthos changes.

Conservation of aquatic living resources under conditions of large-
scale development of oil and gas resources on the Pacific continental 
shelf (the Sea of Okhotsk)  
Julia Zaitseva

According to Food and Agriculture Organization 
projections, high growth rates of the global human 
population may result in an increase in food 
shortages, especially in protein food products in the 
near future. Non-renewable energy sources are 
dwindling and will tend to rise in price on the world 
market.  The use of living resources is also 
approaching the maximum sustainable limit.  Fierce 
competition for securing access to biological and 
hydrocarbon resources is increasing among nations.  
Often, only the economic benefits are sought, and the 
conservation of natural resources and environment 
for future generations is relegated to environmental 
movements.  However, effective and rational use of 
natural resources is the only guarantee for the well-
being of humankind.  It should be based on the 
complex estimation of natural resources and 
socioeconomic conditions, including regional 
specific features.  
 
All over the world modernization of economies 
related to natural resource use, with a simultaneous 
increase in withdrawal of natural raw material, 
occurs.  It is unlikely that there will be a nation that 
does not face problems arising from the contradicting 
interests of ministries and agencies, regions and 
economic entities whereby each side tries to gain its 
own benefits while ignoring the interests of society at 
large.     
 
The fishing industry is, in its own way, unique. Its 
whole activity is based on exploitation of renewable 
aquatic bioresources. Thus, their sustainable 
existence and reproduction of bioresources in all 
natural water basins is a basic necessary condition 
without which the stable operation and development 
of the fisheries are impossible.  The state of aquatic 
bioresources is directly related to the ecological 
situation which is formed under the influence of 
numerous natural and anthropogenic factors, such as 
climate variations, fisheries, hydro construction, 
engineering, navigation, mining operations, and 
pollution. Year by year, the anthropogenic impact 
becomes more and more substantial.  With these 
conditions in mind, regular access to reliable 
information on the ecological status of water basins 
and their aquatic bioresources becomes necessary. 
The data on the types and scale of impacts on aquatic 
biota should be the basis for decision making and 
regulatory, legal, organizational and economical 
measures aimed at minimization or elimination of 
environmental damage caused by the anthropogenic 
activities.  
 
In 1972 UNESCO formulated preliminary proposals 
on the establishment of the Global Environment 
Monitoring System.  However, this system has not 
been created until now because of disagreements 
regarding the methods of monitoring, allocation of 
responsibilities among the existing academic and 
sector observational systems. The absence of 
progress in the organization of a system of ecological 
monitoring is an international problem.      
 
The establishment of a comprehensive ecological 
monitoring system has become especially necessary 
because the extraction rate of natural resources has 
approached an unsustainable level.  Recently, coastal 
regions have faced a conflict of interests between oil 
and gas development and fisheries on the continental 
shelf.  
 
When considering the mutual influence of the oil and 
gas industry and fishery on the environment, the 
competitive aspects of this interaction are 
considered.  The fact that hydrocarbon resource 
development at all stages, and even after its 
completion, may negatively affect aquatic resources 
and their habitats, is considered foremost.  However, 
besides the direct antagonistic relationships between 
the oil and fishery industries, there is their indirect 
interaction occurring in the socioeconomic sphere. 
    
Biological processes/Disturbances by oil and gas development 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  263 
In many coastal regions the oil and fishery industries 
are the most significant, and often the only 
components, of the economy that form the basis 
regional development and employment. However, 
both industries are based on the use of natural 
resources and have a number of similar economic 
features that should be considered when developing a 
long-term strategy of coastal region development.   
 
The oil industry uses a non-renewable natural 
resource. To ensure the stable development of oil-
producing regions in the long-term, some benefit 
from hydrocarbon resource extraction should be 
invested in the development of infrastructure, 
industries and agriculture in these regions to ensure 
the dynamic development of the region after 
hydrocarbon resources are depleted.       
 
Bioresource sustainability is an erroneous notion 
when thinking of the possibility of stable 
development and maintenance of socioeconomic 
infrastructure of coastal regions in the long-term.  
However, an overview of coastal regions around the 
world, whose economies are based on fisheries 
(mainly coastal fisheries) provides evidence on the 
increase of socioeconomic crises.  Employment in 
fisheries and related industries is continuously 
decreasing, and governments of many countries are 
forced to take measures to support the fishermen 
while making serious efforts to reduce of the number 
of fishing vessels.  
 
The decrease in the abundance of commercial 
bioresource species due to overfishing, bycatch, 
illegal fisheries, disturbance of habitats, and 
expansion of large-tonnage expedition fleets, is 
considered to be one of the main reasons leading to 
this situation. There is no doubt that all these events 
exist. However, even their complete elimination, and 
recovery of stocks to optimal levels, do not guarantee 
the stable development of fishery-dependent regions. 
 
The fishery industry is different from other 
industries, in which the increase in labor productivity 
is reached due to the introduction of innovative 
technologies, high-productive equipment, use of 
improved materials, etc. The increase in production 
for the fishery industry means only the increase in 
catch per fisherman. However, the volume and cost 
of the natural bioresource base, even renewable and 
maintained at an optimal level, are limited.   
 
In most coastal regions of most developed countries, 
the fishery industry has failed to provide the financial 
benefits necessary to fully develop the regional 
economy and proper resource-saving production. 
This is because the fisheries on most abundant 
species are not super-profitable, and the most in-
demand and high-value species of aquatic resources 
are now utilized to the full extent.    
 
The development of the richest shelf oil and gas fields 
that make large profits should provide the source of 
investment necessary to ensure the future development 
of coastal areas. For this to happen, it is necessary to 
develop a mechanism for withholding some part of the 
profit by governments in the form of natural rent, to be 
saved in specialized funds for regional development. It 
may also be possible to exempt part of the profit from 
taxation on condition that it be invested in the 
development of regional economy.      
 
Reasonable planning of oil and fishery industry 
development should be based on the principle of a 
balanced management of coastal zones, providing for 
common interests of users of different resources in 
both economic and environment protection areas. 
Making a profit should not be a top priority. For 
example, in the case of hydrocarbon development on 
the West Kamchatka shelf, it is necessary to take into 
account the natural uniqueness of this region and to 
ban, by law, the exploration and development of 
resources in the area.    
 
In a balanced approach to natural resource 
exploitation, the oil and gas industry damage done to 
the fishery may ironically favor its conservation by 
creation of alternative employment sources for 
populations living in coastal regions through the 
gradual decrease in fishing pressure on aquatic 
bioresources, and by investing revenue received from 
the oil and gas industry into environment-oriented 
projects, including monitoring and protection of 
aquatic bioresources.   
 
Regarding the organization of efficient ecologic–fishery 
monitoring, an absence of basic ecological data 
prevents the reliable identification of anthropogenic 
components, among other factors, that cause changes in 
the environment and degradation of aquatic ecosystems. 
As a result, instead of the harmonious development of 
natural resources, inter-sectoral disputes emerge 
resulting in economical and social crises and 
unavoidable losses for all competing sides.    
Biological processes/Disturbances by oil and gas development 
264  PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
Debates regarding the causes and amount of damage to 
living resources determine that the causal relationship 
between committed actions and the following adverse 
consequences, or appearance of substantial damage to 
the environment and human health, is of great 
importance. It is necessary to find out if these adverse 
consequences are caused by other factors, including 
natural factors, and if they occur independently of 
industrial operations and states of crisis.   
 
Planned sustainable use of natural resources should 
be made in a stepwise manner. It should include a 
definition of the purpose of living and non-living 
resource exploitation, taking into account local 
specific ecological features, and provide a selection 
of optimal alternatives and suggest the possibility of 
planned improvement. The need becomes obvious 
for developed ecological management within oil and 
gas producing companies not only during exploratory 
surveys, planning and designing of industrial 
complexes, but for the lifetime of the operations until 
resource depletion.  
The initiative and activities of industry, rather than a 
system of strict governmental management, control 
and supervision, are the most effective conditions for 
mutually profitable non-crisis development of the oil 
and gas producing industry, and fisheries.  Fishery 
companies aiming at long-term development and 
promotion of urban development should also be 
interested in maintaining their good reputation by 
allowing them to obtain cheap credit at banks, i.e., 
strengthen their positions under the fierce 
competition. Thus, the participation in a system of 
ecological monitoring should become necessary for 
both oil workers and fishermen.  
 
Figure 1 shows the organization of ecologic and 
fishery monitoring. To obtain reliable information 
about the status of aquatic bioresources and their 
habitats, and industrial processes affecting the 
environment, the free exchange of information, 
extensive discussions of emerging issues and joint 
managerial decision making are necessary.

A stable environment and successful development of 
the fishery industry as a specific sector of the 
national economy plays an important role in 
guaranteeing a secure food supply, and the 
development and maintenance of a socioeconomic 
infrastructure in coastal regions. Hence, the strategy 
of effective resource-conserving natural management 
is needed, taking into account the conservation of 
aquatic biological resources and their habitats. 
Minimization of the growing anthropogenic impact 
to the marine ecosystem is actual recently and should 
be managed at the governmental level.  For this to 
happen, it would be expedient to establish 
consultative bodies which would include 
representatives of legislative and executive powers, 
industrial companies, and scientific organizations to 
ensure the operation of the specific sectors of 
economy and environment-oriented organizations.    
 
Understanding the danger of taking an antagonistic 
approach to resource development by nature-oriented 
structures results from the fact that the stability of 
environment, natural-resource potential and 
guaranteed right of future generations to clean 
environment would otherwise be jeopardized.   
 
Only by the formulation of a common purpose and 
through the consolidation of efforts by the whole 
world community are we able to guarantee the 
diminishing negative anthropogenic impact on marine 
ecosystems and bioresources, and development of 
effective exploitation of natural resources.

Abstract 
 
Long-term analysis of ichtyoplankton surveys and growth data indicates that the Okhotsk Sea waters off the 
north Kuril Islands and south-western Kamchatka is the traditional spawning region of walleye pollock of east 
Kamchatka origin.  In this area the spawning “peak” occurs later than in western Kamchatka waters from the 
end of April to the beginning of May.  So, it is necessary to conduct an additional ichtyoplankton survey at the 
end of April in order not to underestimate part of the walleye pollock stock. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Walleye pollock is one of the most numerous fish 
species in the North Pacific and is a very important 
fishery resource.  The Okhotsk Sea is a main pollock 
fishery region.  In 1992 the total catch was about 2.7 
million metric tons.  In the last 5 years it has 
averaged 0.6 million metric tons.  
 
A great deal of attention is always given to studying 
walleye pollock biology, stock dynamics, and 
especially reproduction because: 
• Spawning conditions define the efficiency of 
reproduction leading to generation abundance; 
• The walleye pollock fishery in the Okhotsk Sea 
occurs during the prespawning and spawning 
periods when the pollock form dense aggregations 
accessible for fishing; 
• Stock estimations and total allowable catch 
forecasts are based on egg survey data obtained in 
the period near the spawning peak. 
 
In the eastern part of the Okhotsk Sea ichtyoplankton 
surveys have been conducted annually by 
KamchatNIRO since 1972, and from TINRO-Center 
since 1982. Standard stations grids are used. 
 
The spawning grounds in the Okhotsk Sea have been 
known for a long time (Fadeev, 1987; Shuntov et al., 
1993; Zverkova, 2003) and are located (Fig. 1, 
counterclockwise from bottom) in the waters of the 
south Kuril Islands and Hokkaido island; in the 
 
waters adjacent to western Kamchatka, including 
Shelikhov Gulf; in the northwestern part of the 
Okhotsk Sea; and nearby north-east Sakhalin island. 
 
In the northern part the Okhotsk Sea the center of 
walleye pollock reproduction is located on the west 
Kamchatka shelf.  In this area, time and location of 
spawning vary from year to year depending on the 
temperature conditions (Fadeev and Ovsyannikov, 
2001; Varkentin et al., 2001). Reproduction 
continues from January till July.  The average peak 
of spawning in this region is from the end of March 
to the beginning of April (Fadeev, 1987).  
 
It is interesting to note that in the beginning of April 
in the area to the south of 52°N, walleye pollock egg 
catches are minimal (2–3 eggs/m
2
) despite the high 
concentrations of mature fish there.  Is it probable 
that in this area spawning proceeds later than in the 
western Kamchatka waters? Some researchers 
(Fadeev and Ovsyannikov, 2001) have noticed that in 
the south-western Kamchatka waters usually two 
spawning peaks, so-called “spawning waves”, occur: 
in the beginning and at the end of April.  
 
Could it be that walleye pollock spawn in the 
Okhotsk Sea waters off the north Kuril Islands too? 
Having analyzed archival materials from 1961 to the 
present, we found that ichtyoplankton surveys have 
been made here only in the end of March, or in July. 
These and other questions are the subject of our 
research.

Data and Methods 
 
This work is based on ichtyoplankton surveys 
conducted in 2007–2008 in the Okhotsk Sea waters 
off the north Kuril Islands and near western 
Kamchatka (Table 1, Fig. 2).  
 
An ichtyoplankton Conic Net (ICN-80) was used. 
Egg collections were obtained from 300 m depth to 
the surface or from bottom to the surface, if depth 
was less than 300 m. The net was lifted at a speed 
0.5–0.6 m/s. 
 
Stages of development of walleye pollock eggs were 
defined by the Rass scale (Rass and Kasanova, 
1966). Total embryogenesis duration was calculated 
using the equation of Zolotov et al. (1987): 
 
Т = 38.9 е(–0.156 t). 
 
Stage I was 20% of embryogenesis duration 
(Gorbunova, 1954). Total egg production for the 
entire spawning season was counted by the Gauss 
curve (Buslov et al., 2004).  In addition, we analyzed 
data from ichtyoplankton surveys made in western 
Kamchatka waters later than April 20 between 51° 
and 58°N latitudes (Table 2).

Results and Discussion 
 
Relative centers of spawning were determined by the 
concentrations of stage I eggs. In the western 
Kamchatka waters, the duration of stage I eggs varies 
from 7 to 10 days, depending on temperature 
(Zolotov et al., 1987).  Most of the walleye pollock 
eggs and larvae develop within a quasi-stationary 
current circulation system created by the West 
Kamchatka and Compensate Currents (Karmanov, 
1982; Vasilkov and Glebova, 1984; Zolotov, 1991; 
Varkentin et al., 2001).  
 
In the middle of April 2007, egg distribution in the 
western Kamchatka waters appeared typical. The 
main concentrations of stage I eggs were found 
between 53° and 56°N latitudes. The relative center 
of spawning was at 53°N latitude at a depth of 90 m 
(Fig. 3).  We consider that had the survey been made 
after the spawning peak, more than 30% of all eggs 
would be at stage II (Table 3).  It is worth noting that 
south of the research area, egg collections were 
minimal: about 10 eggs/m
2
 despite the high 
concentrations of mature fish.  
 
An additional survey conducted in the north Kuril 
Islands area at the end of April shows that there was 
intensive spawning in this region (Fig. 4; Table 3). 
Concentrations of stage I eggs reached 12,000 
eggs/m
2
 at a depth of 80 m. It is the first time that 
such high egg concentrations have been found in this 
area.  
 
In 2008 walleye pollock spawning in the Okhotsk 
Sea waters off the north Kuril Islands and south-
western Kamchatka waters also occurred at the end 
of April, but the area of highest egg concentrations 
was situated further to the north compared to 2007 
(Fig. 5, Table 3).

How much spawning occurs regularly in nearby 
south-western Kamchatka?  We analyzed data of 
ichtyoplankton surveys made in the western 
Kamchatka waters later than April 20 for the period 
1978 to 2002.  Figure 6 clearly shows that in all 
years there was intensive walleye pollock spawning 
here. Considering their high migratory activity, it is 
quite probable that pollock from elsewhere spawn in 
this region.  
 
The nearest walleye pollock spawning grounds are 
situated in the south-eastern Kamchatka and north 
Kuril Islands waters (Fig. 7) which are inhabited by 
the East-Kamchatka population (Buslov and Tepnin, 
2007).  Intensive spawning occurs at the end of April 
to the beginning of May, which is approximately at 
the same time as at south-western Kamchatka. There 
appear to be no geographical barriers to walleye 
pollock migrations from this region to the Okhotsk 
Sea.  They can migrate into the Okhotsk Sea through 
the north Kuril Islands straits with the East 
Kamchatka Current (Fig. 8). 
 
For proof of this hypothesis, we made a size-at-age 
analysis because it is known that the rate of pollock 
growth in the eastern part of the Okhotsk Sea is 
lower than in the east Kamchatka area (Buslov, 
2003).  A selection was made of 6-, 7-, 8-year-old 
Walleye pollock 
274  PICES Scientific Report No. 36 
mature fishes caught in three different regions in the 
period from February until April: 
1)  To the north from 53°N in the western 
Kamchatka waters; 
2)  To the south from 53°N in Okhotsk Sea waters 
off the north Kuril Islands and in the south-
western Kamchatka waters; 
3)  To the south from 52°N in Pacific Ocean waters 
off the north Kuril Islands and in the south-
eastern Kamchatka waters. 
As noted in Figure 9, the size structure of pollock is 
different by regions, and is connected with distinct 
rates of growth. The southeast region (3) has the 
largest average length-at-age pollock, the western 
Kamchatka region (1) has the smallest average size, 
and south-western Kamchatka (2) is intermediate 
(Table 4).  Differences were statistically significant 
among all regions within age class, except between 
regions 2 and 3 for 8-year olds (Table 5).

Walleye pollock 
PICES Scientific Report No. 36  277 
Despite the long period of walleye pollock study in 
the Okhotsk Sea, we are just now learning something 
new about its biology.  It is necessary to improve the 
ichtyoplankton survey method in view of this new 
knowledge by conducting a second survey in the 
Okhotsk Sea waters off the north Kuril Islands and in 
south-western Kamchatka (to the south of 53°N) at 
the end of April. Otherwise, part of the walleye 
pollock stock spawning in this area later than in the 
west Kamchatka waters will be underestimated.  
 
By our assessment, the spawning stock biomass in 
2007 in the Okhotsk Sea waters off the north Kuril 
Islands was about 45,000 metric tons.  This allows us 
to recommend about an additional 9,000 metric tons 
for a coastal fishery by Danish seine vessels. It is 
very important for coastal fishery development in 
this region. 
 
Conclusions 
 
Okhotsk Sea waters off the north Kuril Islands and 
south-western Kamchatka area is the traditional 
spawning region of walleye pollock of east 
Kamchatka origin.  In this area a pollock spawning 
“peak” occurs later than in the western Kamchatka 
waters at the end of April–beginning of May. 
 
It is necessary to conduct a second ichtyoplankton 
survey in Okhotsk Sea waters off the north Kuril 
Islands and in the south-western Kamchatka waters 
at the end of April.  New data will give us the means 
to develop the walleye pollock fishery in the south-
western Kamchatka waters.

Responses of relative abundance of dominants in fish communities 
to the Sea of Okhotsk climate variability

Summary 
 
The dynamics of the relative abundance of dominant species and the dynamics of the factor scores of all the rest 
of the species of nekton in the upper and entire epipelagic layers is studied by years, according to the data of the 
summer and autumnal comprehensive ecosystem studies of the Sea of Okhotsk (1984–2006).  Time-spatial 
differences in the discovered agreements of the fluctuations of relative abundance of  species, abstractly have 
been the factors of multivariate analysis, with the dynamics of the number of sun spots. Climate Indices of the 
Northern Pacific, hydro- and atmospheric principal components and EOFs of the Sea of Okhotsk are discussed.  
Perceptible deviation of biotic factor scores noted in 1990, 1991 and 1997, 1998.  Strong (|R| ≥ 0.8) and 
statistically significant (p < 0.05) correlations between changes of relative abundance of species and abiotic 
factors of environment with a time-lag up to 6 years are extremely rare  and most of them appeared as a result of 
analyzing data samples with a big proportion of common null values.  A great role of casual variations is 
assumed.  Attempts to use moving average and autocorrelation functions during time series analysis in most cases 
fail because there are a lot of gaps in the short time series (less than 25 years) we have.  Even the successful one 
is useless yet because of a big confidence interval which is greater than the observed variability. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Shuntov (1986) made a successful forecast for the 
long-term fluctuation in abundance of the main 
species in the Far Eastern Seas. Shuntov and his 
adherents considered that environmental changes 
were influenced by cosmic and climatic cyclicity. 
Some TINRO-Centre scientists believe that, in 
general, the higher trophic levels have sufficient 
resources for the consumers in the Sea of Okhotsk 
(Shuntov et al., 1990; Temnykh et al 2003), despite 
the fact that in some regions during certain years 
there was a high demand for the resources 
(Kuznetsova, 2005; Chuchukalo, 2006). The study of 
Far Eastern Seas ecosystems has been based on 
independent data from commercial fishery scientific 
surveys, conducted in the late 1970s. Scientists from 
the Laboratory of Applied Biocenology, TINRO-
Centre, processed millions of these records to filter 
out and normalize the most valuable data to build a 
new Geo Informatic System and Biological DataBase 
(BioDB) with datasets of acceptable quality for year-
to-year comparisons, independent of the instruments 
and methods used. The first results of BioDB data 
processing and analysis, with a 5-year smoothing of 
selected datasets, were presented in the series of 
atlases and collection of tables edited by Shuntov and 
Bocharov (2003a, b).  The Laboratory of Applied 
Biocenology is also trying to determine how the 
interannual variability of values in our BioDB can be 
used to forecast short time series.  This work 
describes the use of the correlation method for time 
series analyses. 
 
Biological patterns 
 
Because of the lack of data for some years, we had to 
combine some time series from 7 biostatistical regions 
of the Sea of Okhotsk (Fig. 1); some data were also 
excluded. The number of sampling stations grouped 
by region from 1984 to 2006 is shown in Table 1. 
 
The next task was to choose an abstraction method 
for presenting more then 300 registered marine 
species. It is almost impossible to describe all 
selected data records; therefore a principal 
components analysis (PCA) was used to extract the 
main factors in biomass fluctuation of communities. 
Main fish species were not associated with any such 
factor.  Therefore, dominant fish communities were 
analyzed separately.  All biological data sets were 
normalized by a logarithmic function (lg(m + 1), 
where m is kg km
2 
).

Regime shifts in total abundance of nekton in the 
Sea of Okhotsk 
 
It is known that there were some significant regime 
shifts of the Principal Component (2) SST index in 
the North Pacific region in 1990 and 1998 (Rodionov 
et al., 2006).  Figure 2 shows that even those species 
that migrate from mesopelagic depths to the upper 
pelagic layer also shifted their abundance in 1990–
1991 and 1997–1998. 
 
Thus we were motivated to measure the power of 
correlation between changes in the world with 
known climatic indices of the Northern Pacific and 
relative biomass fluctuation of nekton species. 
 
Correlations between abiotic and biotic factors in 
the Sea of Okhotsk 
 
We first used AOI, NPI.CPC, PDOw, PDOs, PDOa, 
SI, WPw, WPsp, NPI climatic indices (http://www. 
beringclimate.noaa.gov) for canonical analysis and 
relative species abundance. Results showed only one 
strong and significant (Canonical R = 0.82585, 
Chi(70) = 104.22, p << 0.01) correlation between 
changes in the WPw index and fluctuation of relative 
abundance of jelly fish and juvenile chum salmon in 
the upper pelagic layer during autumn, with a 5-year 
time lag, which was biologically unrealistic.  Other 
significant correlations were not as strong between 
the WPw and pink salmon and rock trout juveniles in 
summer in the upper pelagic layer after a 4- and 6-
year time lag (Canonical R = 0.62690, Chi(54)  = 
121.58, p << 0.01) and between the PDOw, SI and 
walleye pollock and herring juveniles in the 
epipelagic layer after a 1-year time lag (Canonical R 
= 0.55328, Chi(48) = 84.184, p << 0.01).  Only one 
pair (PDOw, SI and walleye pollock) looks close to 
normal (Fig. 3) and could be explained, but it is not 
our main goal.  All other 3D graphs showed very bad 
surface interpolations with negative abundance 
values in possible integers, and deviations from 
surfaces were also too big. 
 
We found that the Siberian Index had the most 
frequent significant correlations with species. Also 
referred to as the Siberian Center, it reflects the 
strength of the Siberian High, and thus, the advection 
of cold Siberian air into the Sea of Okhotsk. 
 
We next checked the strength of statistical 
correlations of changes in relative abundance of 
species with different local types of atmospheric and 
hydrospheric circulations, and compared them with 
sun spot activity.  We chose the types of atmospheric 
processes over the Sea of Okhotsk classified by 
Glebova (2002, 2009) and empirical orthogonal 
functions (EOFs) of Sea of Okhotsk hydrodynamics 
extracted by Luchin (Luchin and Zhigalov, 2006; 
Luchin, 2008). Relative species abundance was 
presented as the principal components obtained from 
the groups with the longest time series.  We had to 
use a rank type (Spearman) correlation analysis 
because the dimensions of different variables were 
not comparable.

Fig. 3 Surface interpolation to the observed abundance of walleye pollock (Z), X and Y (horizontal) axes represent the 
values of climatic indices (PDOw and SI) with a 1-year time lag.  
 
Before conducting further analysis, we wanted to 
know if there were any differences in the influential 
power on biological factors between sun spot 
activity, atmospheric and hydrospheric components. 
Therefore, nonparametric comparison analyses such 
as the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test, the Mann-Whitney 
U test, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample 
test were chosen.  The results were surprising 
because they were all different from each other. We 
obtained from non-significant differences to the next 
sequence:  Hydro ->Atmo -> Sun or Hydro = Atmo > 
Sun due to the low frequency of strong and 
significant correlation occurrence.  For example, 
only 6.5% of strong and significant correlation 
coefficients out of 1320 possible interactions in 
summer (Table 2) and 5.7% of 1122 possible 
interactions in autumn (Table 3) were found.  
 
A little hope for stochastic modeling  
 
Bernoulli first described the random walk in the 18th 
century. Later, Laplas, Brown, Einstein, and Viner 
advanced the techniques of analyzing stochastic 
processes (which are widely distributed in natural 
and technical events).  However, population biologists 
often prefer to use deterministic models which 
require precise parameters that cannot be obtained 
 
experimentally in most cases.  Why do they choose 
to estimate unknown parameters and make a lot of 
runs instead of using stochastic models so popular 
among physicists and economists? 
 
The first problem to be solved is:  How to fulfill the 
gaps in a time series where the quantity of real data 
values is sometimes less than the quantity of absent 
observations?  The second question is:  What should 
we do if the time period is not long enough to 
determine a model type? 
 
Our answers do not pretend to be the best.  At first, 
we did not use a time series with a big portion of 
zero values, and then we tried all possible types of 
moving average and autocorrelation models provided 
by the program “Statistica”.  As a result, we could 
not find an adequate stochastic model. Instead, we 
got white noise over covering (even on the rows with 
determined interventions) after the first trend 
subtracted run. Unfortunately, we do not have a long 
uninterrupted time series; therefore, we had to 
interpolate values for some years from the adjacent 
points even on the longest time series.  In all cases, 
the models did not have acceptable confidence 
intervals because all of them were as wide as the 
observed variability.

Conclusions  
 
In spite of the large number of indices and indicators 
used operationally all over the Northern Pacific to 
quantify the state of the climate and its variability, 
almost none of them can be used to predict 
interannual changes in biological parameters, or 
dominant nekton species of the epi- and upper 
epipelagic layer of the Sea of Okhotsk.  With all the 
power of statistics, why are we still unable to make 
precise predictions on the state of species abundance 
of nekton in the Sea of Okhotsk ecosystem when we 
have access to fast and powerful computers, remote 
sensing, and other facilities? 
 
This work shows the complexity of making even 
simple (at a first glance) correlations between nekton 
species of the epipelagic layer and their environment 
by the use of some sort of abstraction – factors of 
PCA. A detailed discussion would take a lot of 
space, and some parts have already been published 
(Kulik, 2007, 2008). In conclusion, we will not find 
uninterrupted time series of fish abundance surveys 
if we chose them only according to the biostatistical 
regions of the Sea of Okhotsk, studied layers of the 
water column, and survey season.  This limitation 
forces us to fill the times series with some 
hypothetical data (interpolated data) for statistical 
analyses. Therefore, we get wide confidence 
intervals of approximations, which do not let us even 
know where the similarities and real differences are. 
On the other hand, insignificant changes in 
communities (at a first glance) may lead to 
unpredictable states in the future (the well known 
“butterfly effect”). 
 
If we want to get precise data, then we need to 
conduct ecosystem studies of the Sea of Okhotsk 
every year during the same time periods and in the 
same regions. Until then, statistical analysis of strong 
and significant multivariate, canonical and other 
analyses may lead to unacceptable biologically 
nonsensical results. Nevertheless, we can make some 
conclusions: 
1. The interrelationship between groups of species 
are more complex in the southern part of the Sea 
of Okhotsk in summer, and in the northern part 
of the Sea in autumn; 
2. The changes in abundance correlate both with 
the regional climate conditions and heliophysical 
factors (sun spots), but are very rare; 
3. Most of the species do not have alternating 
variability of abundance, although it is usual for 
dominant species; 
4. Perceptible deviation of biotic factor scores were 
noticed for the periods 1990–1991 and 1997–
1998; 
5. Strong (|R| ≥ 0.8) and statistically significant (p 
< 0.05) correlations between changes of relative 
abundance of species and abiotic factors of the 
environment, with a time-lag up to 6 years, are 
extremely rare; 
6. Attempts to use moving average and 
autocorrelation functions during time series 
analysis failed because there are a lot of gaps in 
a short time series (less than 25 years).

Abstract 
 
Research was carried out in the central part of the Okhotsk Sea on the R/V Professor Kaganovsky in the spring 
of 2007.  A total of 22 pelagic trawls were performed across a network of stations on 8 acoustic boards and 23 
ichtyoplankton and hydrological stations. 
 
The results of numerous studies done throughout the 1980s and 1990s suggest that there is no pollock 
spawning in the open waters of the Okhotsk Sea.  The maximum catch of pollock eggs was 7 eggs per catch.  
Pollock of 32–43 cm in length (4- to 6-year olds) dominated the catches.  Among the mature females, the 
dominant group were females with after-spawning gonad maturity – 95%. There were no spawning females. 
 
Depsite sightings of walleye pollock at all the trawl stations, there were no dense concentrations in the 
observed area.  Pollock catches per trawl hour accounted for an average of only 162 kg, or 711 individuals. 
The maximal pollock catches per trawl hour (695 kg, or 7,623 individuals) was in the northern part of the 
observation are near the economic zone of Russia.  This can be explained by pollock migration from the 
northern shelf of the Okhotsk Sea.  Thus, walleye pollock migrating to feed were caught during the serveys. 
They spawned in the shelf of the northern part of the Sea.

Introduction 
 
In the late winter and early spring, walleye pollock, 
Theragra chalcogramma, spawn pelagic, individual 
eggs at mid-water depths.  Some of the spawning 
grounds occur below sea ice, such as in the Sea of 
Okhotsk, but the effect of cold, low-saline water 
derived from melting sea ice on eggs is not well 
known.  The present study examined the effect of 
cold, low-saline water on the survival and hatching 
success of walleye pollock eggs.  
 
Materials and Methods 
 
Live adult pollock were collected by rod fishing in 
late January 2007 and 2008 at the mouth of Funka 
Bay, southwestern Hokkaido Japan, which is known 
as the main spawning grounds of the Pacific Stocks 
occurring around Japan.  The fishes were moved to, 
and reared at, 5°C and two different salinities (29.1 
in 2007 and 33.0 in 2008) in a 10-ton circular tank. 
The naturally spawned eggs were collected and 
maintained under 35 different temperature and 
salinity conditions (seven temperatures; –1.0, 0.0, 
2.0, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0, 11.0°C: five salinities; 24.0, 27.0, 
30.0, 33.0, 35.0) to examine the optimal temperature 
and salinity range for normal hatching, and the 
developmental time for the each condition. This 
study used the egg developmental stage model of 
Kendall and Kim (1989).  To clearly understand the 
movement of eggs in the spawning grounds, the 
change in their buoyancy during development was 
examined by liner density column (Coombs, 1981). 
A summary of the density gradient columns is shown 
in Table 1. 
 
Table 1 Summary of the density gradient columns. 
Temperature (
o
C), top/bottom 5.0/5.0 
Salinity,  top/bottom 18.0/42.0 
Density ( σt) 14.0/33.0 
 
 
The density of the eggs in the column was 
determined by density cubes of 14.8, 20.0, 24.9, 
30.0σt (Martin Instrument Company).  The vertical 
velocities of the eggs in the spawning grounds of 
Funka Bay, and Nemuro Strait, eastern Hokkaido, 
which is known as the spawning ground of the 
Nemuro Strait Stock, were estimated using the 
Stokes law (Sundby, 1983).  
 
Results and Discussion 
   
The hatching rate of normal larvae ranged from a  
low of less than 2°C to a high of 9°C, but showed no 
significant differences over the salinity range 
examined (Fig.1). This indicates that temperature  
< 2.0°C is not favorable for hatching and the success 
of normal hatching is controlled by temperature 
rather than by salinities.  Additionally, there were no 
differences in the hatching days after the 
fertilizations and the developmental stages among 
the salinities, suggesting that developmental time 
was also controlled by temperature.

Although, the eggs were spawned in different water 
properties in 2007 (temperature 5°C, salinity 29.1, 
density 23.0 σt) and in 2008 (temperature 5°C, 
salinity 33.0, density 23.8 σt ), the buoyancy of the 
eggs soon after fertilization showed no difference. 
Coombs et al. (2004) showed that the buoyancy of 
eggs is affected by the ratio of the volume of the 
vitelline mass, with almost the same osmotic 
pressure to the adult, and the volume of the peri-
vitelline space, in which the osmotic pressure is 
almost equal to the sea water.  The pollock eggs have 
a much larger volume of the vitelline mass than that 
of vitelline space. Thus, the primary buoyancy of the 
egg is probably determined by the adult.  The change 
in the density of the egg during development is 
shown in Figure 2.  The density ranged from 19.0–
25.1( σt), and gradually increased by stage VI (late 
stage), after which the change in densities varied. 
The estimated vertical velocities of eggs were 10.8 
m/s in Funka Bay and 9.6 m/s in the Nemuro Strait, 
which indicates that the eggs reach the surface in 
approximately 7 h in Funka Bay and 21 h in the 
Nemuro Strait after spawning.  It suggests that eggs 
are exposed to the surface cold water in the early 
developmental stage. Nakatani and Maeda (1984) 
suggested that eggs are able to resist cold 
temperatures after the morula stage.  The stage of 
developmental upon reaching the cold water is 
probably one of the key factors determining the 
success of hatching.

Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) is the 
most valuable fish species in the Sea of Okhotsk.  
The Russian pollock fishery started in the 1960s and 
the first considerable landings (35,000 t) occurred in 
1962 (Fadeev and Vespestad, 2001).  The epoch of 
large-scale exploitation of pollock resources began in 
1965, when the landings totaled 293,000 t.  Since 
then landings had been increasing and in 1968 
attained an impressive total of 675,000 t.  The first 
historical maximum was marked in 1975 when 
1,300,000 t of pollock were landed. In those years 
the fishery was exclusively concentrated in the 
eastern part of the sea, off western Kamchatka.  Then 
landings started to decrease, reaching a low of 
482,000 t in 1981.  The second period of large 
catches >1,500,000 t (Fig. 1) occurred in 1985–1997. 
Discovery of a new fishing ground in the northern 
part of the Sea of Okhotsk contributed to the 
outgrowth of catches.  These successful years in the 
fishery were followed by another period of low 
landings with a minimum (394,000 t) in 2004.  The 
following years saw a significant increase in landings 
(up to 680,000 t). 
 
The pollock fishery in the open part of the Sea of 
Okhotsk (peanut hole) is much younger than in the 
other fishing grounds.  The first information about 
the pollock catches taken by foreign fishing vessels 
in this area appeared in the late 1980s, when there 
was large-scale unregulated fishing for pollock in the 
open part of the Bering Sea (donut hole).  The 
pollock fishery continued in the peanut hole from 
1991–1994 and produced a maximum yield totaling 
698,000 t.  Considering that this fishery was based 
on the pollock stocks of Russian origin, Russia 
suffered a severe amount of economic damage.  The 
presented history of the pollock fishery in the Sea of 
Okhotsk shows that a considerable interannual 
variability in the yield introduces large uncertainty in 
planning and managing this fishery. 
 
However, landings do not show the actual dynamics 
of the stocks, as they are mostly dependent on the 
fishing intensity, i. е., on the fishing effort.  There are 
many Russian scientific publications devoted to the 
pollock stock dynamics in the Sea of Okhotsk 
(Fadeev, 1980; Kachina, Sergeeva, 1981; Vasil’kov 
and Glebova, 1984; Shuntov, 1986; Shuntov et al., 
1993; Avdeev et al., 2001; Fadeev, 2001; Varkentin 
and Sergeeva, 2004). Our goal is to identify cyclicity 
in various levels of the pollock stock and attempt to 
give a medium-term forecast.

Research conducted in VNIRO (Babayan et al., 
2006), based on fishing statistics and the 
Instantaneous Separable Virtual Population Analysis 
(ISVPA) modeling, showed that in 1974–2003 the 
spawning and the fishable biomass of walleye  
pollock in the eastern part of the Sea of Okhotsk 
were changing concurrently (Fig. 2).  According to 
our data, there was a high correlation coefficient of 
0.94.  Over three decades there were four maxima of 
the fishing and spawning stocks (1974, 1984, 1994, 
and 2003) and three periods of low stock abundance 
(1978–1979, 1990, and 2000). During the entire 
period of observations, the stocks restored from the 
minimum level to an average one fairly rapidly (3–4 
years), thus demonstrating their stability. It is 
noteworthy that the decrease in stocks from 
maximum levels to minimum ones occurred with a 5- 
to 6-year lag after the curve bend.  
 
The TINRO-Center studies (1983–2008) were based 
on assessment of eggs spawned by pollock females. 
Surveys took place in spring and were made with an 
IKS-80 ichthyoplankton net. Results of these 
observations (Avdeev et al., 2001, TINRO-Center 
data) showed that values of the spawning biomass of 
pollock in the eastern part of the Okhotsk Sea and in 
the entire Sea of Okhotsk changed concurrently 
(Fig. 3).  During the entire period of observations, 
there were three maxima of stocks (1984–1987, 
1994–1995, and 2007–2008) and two minima (1991 
and 2000–2001). According to our data, the 
correlation coefficient was high, having a value of 
0.90. Thus, despite different techniques of the 
biomass assessment used in VNIRO and TINRO-
Center, the results of assessment were very close: 
there is a 10–12 year periodicity in occurrence of the 
maximum and minimum stocks.

Water temperature has a significant impact on the 
generation success in the first year of the pollock life 
history.  As a rule, weak generations appear in cold 
years, while abundant generations occur in warm 
years.  This phenomenon could be associated with 
several facts: there is better food availability in warm 
years; young fish have a higher initial growth rate; 
metabolism accelerates and increases the fish 
viability.  Abundance of recruitment influences the 
growth or decrease of the fishing and spawning 
stocks.  Among the most important global climatic 
events which influence the sea temperature is the 
Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).  We analyzed the 
variability in the pollock fishable and spawning 
stocks in connection with the PDO anomalies and 
found that periods of high pollock biomass occurred 
during years of PDO positive anomalies. Minimum 
values of biomass were generally observed in periods 
of PDO negative anomalies. (Figs. 4 and 5).  A sharp 
drop in the PDO in 2008 suggests that the years of 
positive anomalies ended and another period of 
negative anomalies will begin which will likely to 
lead to a decrease in pollock biomass.

Studies show that the stock dynamics is 
characterized by a 10-year interval.  Tables 1 and 2 
summarize data on the pollock stock assessment 
grouped by decades.  Thus, in the first column of 
Table 1 the value of 4,538,000 t corresponds to 1974, 
while in the first column of Table 2 the value of 
3,560,000 t corresponds to 1983, etc.  The last 
column gives averages for the entire period of 
observations. These data are also presented 
graphically (Fig. 6). These figures show that the 
minimum averaged values of spawning and fishing 
stocks correspond to points 9 and 0 (see Tables 1 and 
2), i. е., occur at the end of the decade.  
 
The obtained results allow us to already forecast a 
considerable decrease in pollock stocks in 2009–
2010.  The 10-year minimum is likely to be attained 
in 2011–2012, and the stock will probably restore in 
2014–2015 with further growth reaching a maximum 
in 2016–2017.
