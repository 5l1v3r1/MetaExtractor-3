EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
 
 This review focuses on modelling ocean circulation and its variability in the subarctic 
North Pacific; it addresses issues specific to that region, and not the subject of ocean modelling in 
general. The performance of existing models is assessed in relation to observations in the upper 
ocean, intermediate waters and deep/abyssal waters.  Not surprisingly, the quality of model 
results is generally found to match that of the observations.  Models of surface circulation, where 
data are most abundant, reproduce many observed features, while the reliability of model results 
at greater depths remains more problematic.  In general, model results are found too coarse and 
insufficiently reliable for many of the applications towards which they have been developed 
(fisheries, pollution, climate...) and significant improvements are required.  
 
 We have identified a number of gaps in physical understanding and supporting data 
which need be filled to improve model performance.  Many of these apply to ocean modelling in 
general, but some, particularly with respect to the influence of marginal seas (Bering, Japan, 
Okhotsk), are specific to the subarctic North Pacific.  Recommendations address ways of filling 
these gaps and using international collaboration within PICES to foster development of better 
ocean circulation models in the subarctic North Pacific.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
 Numerical modelling has become the 
primary tool for analysis and design in many areas 
of fluid mechanics.  This is also true of 
atmospheric and oceanic flows, where numerical 
models are used to explore the subtleties of flow 
dynamics, examine the consequences of changes 
in physical parameters and develop flow patterns 
for domains of complex geometry under realistic 
forcing conditions.  Numerical modelling has also 
become a tool to guide observations, identifying 
areas where the most revealing measurements 
should be made and which data in turn should be 
assimilated into predictive models (Smith, 1991).  
Hydrodynamic models are readily extended, at 
least in principle, to include chemical properties of 
ocean waters and the lower trophic levels of 
oceanic biology.  Modelling opens a window into 
the future by simulating conditions resulting from  
different scenarios and policies; it similarly offers 
a tool for the exploration of past conditions.  
 
 Numerical simulation represents a step 
comparable to the invention of calculus in the 
analysis and understanding of nature.  It will play 
an increasingly important role in ocean science 
and its applications.  In view of its highly 
technical nature and rapid development, it is 
important that progress and prospects in the 
modelling of the oceans be frequently reviewed.  
 
 Working Group 7 of PICES has been 
charged with reviewing the state of modelling 
efforts of the circulation of the subarctic Pacific. 
Our terms of reference, presented in Appendix 1, 
also require that we identify areas where progress 
may be made through enhanced data coverage and 
improved physical understanding, and that we 
comment on the consequences of current 
deficiencies in modelling the circulation on other 
kinds of models pertaining, for example, to the 
climate, ecosystems, and material transports.  Key 
scientific questions arising in the oceanography of 
the subarctic North Pacific have been summarized 
in an earlier report by Working Group 6 of PICES 
(Hargreaves and Sugimoto, 1993).  The success 
and challenges of modelling the circulation and 
ocean properties of our area may be assessed in 
terms of the ability of models to answer these key 
questions.  
 
 We first define the scope of the review, 
identifying the spatial and temporal scales of 
relevant oceanic phenomena.  We follow with an 
overview of the state of the art of existing models, 
assessed in terms of their ability to reproduce 
observations in areas of special interest.  We 
continue with a discussion of improvements 
thought to be required in understanding and 
modelling physical processes. The role of 
marginal seas and improvements required in 
linking their circulation with that of the open 
ocean are discussed next, followed by a discussion 
of the need for additional data sources and quality.  
Finally, we discuss the consequences of the 
perceived deficiencies of North-Pacific circulation 
models on the modelling of other properties.  
Specific recommendations for achieving required 
improvements are also presented.

2.0 SCOPE OF REVIEW 
 
 In approaching a topic as vast as ocean 
modelling, it is important to clearly define the 
scope of our review.  Our topic of interest is the 
subarctic North Pacific, defined as that area north 
of 30 °N, and not the world ocean, nor ocean 
modelling in general, which have been reviewed 
elsewhere (see for example Marotzke, 1994; 
Weaver and Hughes, 1994; WOCE 1994; 
McWilliams, 1996).  Furthermore, we under-
stand circulation to mean fairly large-scale, slowly 
varying motion. Although of great practical 
interest, phenomena such as waves, tides, tsunamis 
and similar high-frequency motions will  not be 
discussed here, unless they happen to have some 
effect in the longer term. We are interested, 
however in mesoscale eddies, their strength, 
position and variability.  Similarly, the modelling 
of coastal basins on the continental shelf, where 
great progress has been made in developing 
practical simulation and decision-making tools, 
will not be included in our review.  Only major 
coastal regions, also known as marginal seas, will 
be considered of interest, and then only because of 
their influence on large-scale oceanic properties, 
mainly through buoyancy fluxes and processes of 
water mass formation. 
 
 The smallest oceanic processes (surface 
and internal wave breaking, turbulent entrainment, 
shear instability, double diffusion...) take place 
over scales of centimeters to tens of meters, well 
below the resolution of large-scale models.  The 
effect of these processes must perforce be 
parameterized, and the appropriateness and 
accuracy of such parameterizations is a general 
concern in ocean modelling.  (cf. for example 
Bryan, 1987; Cummins et al., 1990; Danabasoglu, 
1994; Gargett and Holloway, 1992; Large et al., 
1994).  Our review addresses issues of sub-grid-
scale parameterization only in as much as they are 
identified as being particularly pertinent to our 
area of interest, the subarctic North Pacific.  
 
 The smallest horizontal scale considered 
of interest in open-ocean models is the Rossby 
radius of the first internal mode, of the order of 20 
km in length over most of the area of interest 
(Emery et al., 1984).  Models capable of resolving 
mesoscale eddies, which occur on that scale, are 
said to be "eddy-resolving".  A resolution of 1/8th 
of a degree seems to be sufficient to resolve most 
features of interest.  In complicated areas, like the 
Kuroshio-Oyashio confluence zone, a higher 
resolution is needed to model dynamic and 
bathymetric interactions. Enhanced resolution is 
also necessary in coastal regions, where smaller 
scales are often imposed by the boundary 
geometry and by the punctual nature of buoyancy 
sources, such as rivers.  The problem of matching 
relatively coarse open-ocean models to finer-scale 
marginal sea models is important in the subarctic 
North Pacific, as in other ocean areas. In the 
vertical, a higher level of resolution is often 
required to resolve critical topographic details or 
the structure of important transitions.  In 
modelling the evolution of the seasonal 
thermocline, and the processes through which 
energy, momentum and mass are exchanged 
between the atmosphere and the ocean, special 
attention must be paid to the dynamics of the 
mixed layer, in the upper 200-300 metres of the 
ocean, so that the finest vertical resolution must be 
applied to that region.    
 
 An extremely important consideration in 
modelling is verification against observations. 
Ocean modelling has not reached the level of 
sophistication of operational atmospheric weather 
modelling, where extensive verification is possible 
against a rich observational network. Perhaps that 
degree of sophistication will come some day, 
when model results can be routinely compared at 
an eddy-resolving level against satellite altimetry 
and temperature data (cf. Hurlburt, 1984 for a 
review of this topic, and Carnes et al., 1995, for a 
recent application to the North Pacific).  At this 
point, it was agreed that models should be judged 
on their ability to reproduce some key features 
correctly, and part of the Working Group's 
discussion focused on the identification of these 
features, in specific areas.

3.0 REVIEW OF EXISTING MODELS 
 
 In terms of circulation patterns and 
general water property structure, one may 
recognize four superposed layers in the subarctic 
North Pacific.  The uppermost, near-surface layer, 
is subject to direct atmospheric interactions, and is 
clearly the most energetic and variable layer of the 
ocean. It includes the wind-mixed Ekman layer 
and the cooling convection layer to the pycnocline 
( ∼ 500 m).  This is arguably the layer of greatest 
interest to human needs and activities, and also 
that which has been observed in most detail.  This 
layer has received the most modelling attention 
and will be discussed in greatest detail.  Below it 
(in the range 500 - 1,500 m), we find an 
intermediate layer, which is particularly important 
in the subarctic Pacific because of the presence of 
the North Pacific Intermediate Water, a water mass 
of relatively low salinity which extends over much 
of the region.  The lower part of this later includes 
flow associated with the northward spread of 
Antarctic Intermediate Waters.  Further down 
(1,500 - 4,000 m), we recognize a slow deep 
circulation, which may be considered as a return 
flow to the abyssal circulation (4,000 m to bottom) 
associated with inflow of the mixed Antarctic 
Bottom Water and North Atlantic Deep Water 
steered by bottom topography.  Because so little 
is known about these two deepest layers, they will 
be lumped together in our discussion.   
 
 While the region of interest is the 
subarctic North Pacific, it is impossible to consider 
the circulation in one area in complete isolation 
from the rest of the ocean.  Vigorous flow from 
the south enters the region in the west (the 
Kuroshio);  the influence of El Niño penetrates 
the ocean from the east as variability in seasonal to 
decadal time scales.  There is also evidence, 
mostly in the distribution of water properties, of 
important meridional transport at depth.  For 
example, Bingham and Lukas (1994) have 
detected the presence of North Pacific 
Intermediate Water near the Philippines, where it 
appears to contribute to the Indonesian 
Throughflow (Gordon, 1995) and hence to the 
return branch of the main thermohaline conveyor 
belt circulation.  Most models of the subarctic 
North Pacific circulation have been, and will 
continue to be parts of models concerned with the 
entire Pacific Ocean and, increasingly, the whole 
World Ocean.  
 
3.1  Surface circulation 
 
3.1.1  General Features 
 
 The surface circulation is that about which 
we know the most and where modelling efforts 
have also been most intense.  Models have been 
developed for wind-forcing, or thermohaline 
forcing, or both. In simplified form, the surface 
circulation of the North Pacific consists of a 
clockwise subtropical gyre in the south and a 
counter-clockwise subpolar gyre in the north (Fig. 
1).  The subtropical gyre consists of a strong 
western boundary current in the west, the 
Kuroshio, and a more diffuse return circulation 
over the rest of the ocean.  Similarly, the subarctic 
gyre has strong flows on western boundaries 
which, probably because of their geographical 
configuration, partly break up the larger gyre in 
sub-gyres:  the Alaskan Gyre, the Bering Sea 
Gyre, the Western Subarctic Gyre and a gyre 
within the Sea of Okhotsk. (Ohtani, 1991).  There 
is much variability in the area bordering on the 
Aleutian Island chain and some uncertainty in the 
degree of connection, partly through the Bering 
Sea, between the Alaskan Gyre in the east and the 
Western Subarctic Gyre in the west.  The region 
considered here includes all the subarctic gyres 
and the northern part of the subtropical gyre.  
 
 Existing circulation models readily 
reproduce some of the gross features of the near-
surface circulation.  For example, the 
Cherniawsky and Holloway (1991) simplified 
upper-ocean model, driven by wind-stress and 
surface heat and fresh-water fluxes, yields an 
Alaskan Gyre, a Western Subarctic Gyre and an 
Okhotsk Sea Gyre (Fig. 2).  The absence of the 
Aleutian Island chain in the model of course 
makes any comparison with the observed 
circulation impossible in that area.  
 
 State-of-the-art eddy-resolving models of 
the whole ocean (Semtner and Chervin, 1988, 
 4
1992) or of the Pacific (Hurlburt et al., 1992, 
1995) or some of its parts (Cummins and Freeland, 
1993) typically include a number of vertical layers 
(6 to 20) and a resolution of 1/2 to 1/16 of a 
degree (although higher resolution models have 
been developed for restricted regions).  Such 
models, driven by observed winds, do reproduce 
the main features of the circulation seen in Fig. 1, 
and also exhibit considerable mesoscale eddy 
activity, occurring where it is actually observed, 
near Sitka (southeast Alaska), the Queen Charlotte 
Islands, the Alaskan Stream and in the Kuroshio 
extension region. Examples are shown in Fig. 3 -5.  
 
 A more critical comparison of model 
results with observations must focus on areas of 
sufficient data density, where specific features are 
clearly recognized.  We have identified four such 
regions: the Kuroshio path south of Japan; the 
Kuroshio-Oyashio confluence; the Kuroshio 
extension; and the Alaskan Gyre.  
 
3.1.2  Specific regions 
 
a.  The Path of the Kuroshio 
 
 South of Japan, the Kuroshio takes 
different paths, changing between them on an 
interannual basis (Fig. 6).  The two most frequent 
paths are the "straight path", also referred to as N-
type (normal) and a "large-meander path", also 
called A-type (abnormal). These two states persist 
for periods of several months to several years. The 
next most persistent path is the "C-type", which 
takes a detour south of Hachijo Island (Izu Ridge).  
Two other paths (B and D) are transient features 
observed during the transition period from one 
stable path to another.  The predominantly 
bimodal path characteristics of the Kuroshio south 
of Japan are peculiar to this region and are not 
observed in the Kuroshio extension, to the east, or 
in other major western boundary currents.  Path 
variations and duration have a strong effect on 
fisheries, marine transportation and climate along 
the southern coast of Japan.  There is a practical 
need for understanding path dynamics and for a 
predictive model of path selection. 
 From a physical point of view, four kinds 
of models of Kuroshio paths have been put 
forward; all include the influence of ocean 
bathymetry in the area south of Japan.  
 
Boundary-value problem model.  Kozlov 
(1986) has reviewed theoretical investigations of 
the bi-modality of the Kuroshio south of Japan.  
The first model is an inflow-outflow type of model 
within the Shikoku Basin, where inflow and 
outflow positions are constrained by the 
bathymetry and the shape of the coastline.  Inflow 
takes place through Tokara Strait in the Nansei 
Island chain south of Kyushu;  outflow is through 
the deeper portions of the Izu-Ogasawara Ridge, 
between Miyake and Hachijo Islands (Fig. 6).  
 
 As originally pointed out by White and 
McCreary (1976), the presence of a standing 
Rossby wave (and hence of one or more 
meanders) of length λ = (U/ β)
1/2
 in a north-
eastward inertial jet size within a basin of given 
size is related to the flow velocity U and to the rate 
of change of the Coriolis parameter β. Masuda 
(1982) presented analytical solutions of Warren's 
(1968) path equations for a nonlinear boundary-
value problem.  He showed the dependence of the 
path on inflow velocity, hysteresis phenomena in 
path selection, and the presence of multiple 
equilibrium states of the straight and large 
meander paths for the same parameter values.  
Yasuda et al. (1985) confirmed Masuda's results 
with a barotropic model of the area south of Japan.  
In both of these models, a straight path generally 
occurs at a relatively high inflow velocity and a 
large meander path at a slower inflow velocity. 
Inclusion of a Munk layer in which viscous 
dissipation takes place near the coast allows a 
straight path also to occur at low inflow velocity.  
 
 Yoon and Yasuda (1987) also investigated 
the dependence of model results on the shape of 
the northern boundary.  With the northern 
boundary running at 23 ° north of east, rather than 
zonally, a viscous straight path occurs at low 
inflow velocity and a large meander path at a high 
velocity, while at intermediate velocities both 
paths can occur for the same parameter values 
(Fig. 7).  Chao (1984) and Akitomo et al. (1991) 
obtained similar results in different model 
configurations.  Masuda (1989) confirmed the 
existence of multiple equilibrium states as well as 
 5
the effects of topography in laboratory 
experiments. 
 
 Geometry-forced meander model.  A 
second type of model considers the nature of the 
path of the Kuroshio to arise from a steady wave 
of the stream forced by local coastal geometry, for 
example, the Kyushu Peninsula, or the Kii 
Peninsula.  White and McCreary (1976) examined 
a lee-wave meander downstream of a coastal bump 
corresponding to Kyushu.  Charney and Flierl 
(1980) analytically examined interactions between 
a jet and periodic coastal bumps and suggested the 
possibility of multiple equilibrium paths.  
Yamagata and Umatami (1987, 1989) also studied 
such interactions and proposed and inlet-
velocity/meander amplitude diagram similar to 
that of Yasuda et al. (1985). 
 
 Bottom control path model.  The third 
type of model is that of a straight path controlled 
by bottom topography.  Robinson and Taft (1972) 
examined path characteristics and effects of 
bottom topography using path equations.  In their 
model, the path which escapes bottom control 
becomes a free inertial jet and forms a large 
meander.  Taft et al. (1973) suggested, on the 
basis of observations, that the straight path could 
not be entirely controlled by bottom topography.  
Sekine (1988a, b, c; 1990) studied the effects of 
bottom topography in a two-layer inflow and 
outflow model with realistic bottom topography in 
the lower layer, confirming the importance of 
topography.  Martynov and Moiseev (1988) also 
studied topographic control of the Kuroshio path. 
 
 Eddy-resolving basin-scale Pacific 
model.  Recently, it has become feasible to 
investigate the path of the Kuroshio south of Japan 
using eddy-resolving basin-scale Pacific models 
(Fig. 4).  Using a 1/8 °, 6-layer Pacific Ocean 
model north of 20 ° S with realistic geometry and 
bottom topography, Hurlburt et al. (1996) were 
able to simulate spontaneous transitions between 
meander and straight paths south of Japan when 
the model was forced by the Hellerman and 
Rosenstein (1983) monthly wind-stress 
climatology year after year.  When they allowed 
interannual variations in the amplitude of the wind 
forcing, they found that path selection shows little 
sensitivity to Tokara Strait transport (transport 
south of Kyushu) over the range simulated (36-72 
Sv in yearly means).  The mean Tokara Strait 
transport for straight paths and meander paths 
differed by only 2 Sv.  However, interannual 
increases in wind forcing or in Tokara Strait 
transport gave rise to a predominant meander path 
while decreases yielded a predominant straight 
path.  Like Yoon and Yasuda (1987) they found 
that baroclinic instability is an important element 
of meander path formation.  They also found that 
a seamount complex west of the Izu Ridge 
enhances the fraction of time that the Kuroshio 
spends in the meander path.  
 
 Transition from straight to meander 
path.  This transition usually occurs as follows: a 
small "trigger" meander, generated south of 
Kyushu, propagates eastward and develops into a 
large meander (Yoshida, 1961; Shoji, 1972; 
Sekine,1992).  Such a small meander is generated 
in early spring almost every year and in the fall of 
some years when the Kuroshio surface velocity 
increases (Sekine and Toba, 1981a; Sekine, 1992).  
These small meanders however do not necessarily 
develop into a large and persistent meander path.  
A detailed analysis (Matsumoto, 1994) shows that 
only those small meanders generated from 
February to August and propagating eastward with 
a velocity below a critical value actually 
developed into large meanders.  A number of 
authors (Sekine and Toba, 1981b; Yoon and 
Yasuda, 1987; Kubokawa, 1989) have examined 
nonlinear vorticity dynamics of meanders in that 
region and the effects of topography and 
stratification on their stability.  
 
 Comparison with observations of 
bimodality.  Following from the above models, a 
number of diagnostic diagrams relating path type 
to Kuroshio volume transport have been proposed.  
It remains impossible to choose between these 
various diagrams because of the lack of sufficient 
observations.  
 Volume transport by the Kuroshio is 
reported to be small during periods of large 
meander paths south of Japan (Taft, 1972; Nitani, 
1972;  Sekine et al., 1991).  In contrast, the 
transport is large in the East China Sea during the 
same periods (Nishizawa et al., 1982). This 
 6
behaviour is confirmed by transport measurements 
across 137 °E (Qiu and Joyce, 1972), and by cross-
stream sea-level differences (measured between 
Naze and Nishinoomote Islands) representative of 
inflow into Tokara Strait (Kawabe 1980).  
 
 These latter observations seem to support 
the results of Yoon and Yasuda (1987) which 
predict, for a two-layer, realistic coastal geometry 
model, a straight Kuroshio path for low inflow 
velocity and a multiplicity of possible states for 
larger velocity.  However, these models do not 
reproduce the "C-type" path which emerges in the 
transition from a large meander to a straight path.  
 
 Seasonal variability.  Geostrophic 
transports calculated from hydrographic sections 
south of Japan indicate maximum transports in 
summer and minimum values in the winter 
(Pavlova, 1964;  Masuzawa, 1965;  Nitani, 1972; 
Taft, 1972, 1978;  Minami et al., 1979).  Sea-
level differences across Tokara Strait indicate the 
same seasonal variation (Blaha and Reed, 1982; 
Kawabe, 1988).  This observed seasonal pattern is 
opposite to the seasonal response expected from a 
Sverdrup balance to applied wind-stress fields.  
However, Greatbatch and Goulding (1989, 1990), 
using a steady-state barotropic model forced by 
monthly wind stress and including realistic 
bathymetry, found that about half of the sea-level 
difference could be explained by a local Sverdrup 
balance.  Sekine and Kutsuwada (1994), also 
pointed out that the volume transport south of 
Japan is actually a maximum in the winter, as 
expected from a Sverdrup balance, while the 
vertical shear, which is what was estimated from 
hydrographic data, is maximum in the summer.  
On the other hand, Qiu (1992), using a 
combination of satellite altimetry and 
hydrographic data, showed that the eastward 
flowing jet is strongest in July and August and that 
the seasonal change is caused by the change in 
intensity of the recirculation gyre south of Japan.   
 
 While models have shed light on many of 
the mechanisms which may be responsible for the 
path taken by the Kuroshio, there is still much to 
be learned in this complex area. Further 
understanding of the Kuroshio south of Japan will 
clearly require more accurate measurements of 
Kuroshio transport and additional improvements 
in numerical models.  Predictive ability will be 
reached only when variations in the strength and 
path of the Kuroshio can also be predicted... 
perhaps in relation to some index of 
meteorological forcing. 
  
b.  The Kuroshio-Oyashio Confluence 
 
 Another area of great interest is the 
Kuroshio-Oyashio confluence region, east of 
northern Japan.  The details of the circulation in 
that complex region have been studied extensively 
(Kawai, 1972;  Kozlov, 1971, 1972; Mizuno and 
White, 1983;  Qiu et al.1991; Yasuda et al. 1992;  
Yasuda, 1995;  Yasuda et al. 1995;  Talley et al., 
1995;  Hurlburt et al., 1996).  The complexity of 
the circulation is illustrated by the various patterns 
used to represent it (Fig. 8).  Overall, one may 
characterize the region as one of extreme 
variability, with rings and meanders appearing, 
drifting and vanishing in a transition zone between 
the Kuroshio and Oyashio frontal regions.  The 
positions and properties of these features are of 
great importance to regional fisheries, navigation 
and climatology and, as for the region previously 
discussed, predictive numerical modelling could 
become an extremely useful tool.  
 
 A prominent feature of the Kuroshio-
Oyashio confluence region is a double front 
system which consists of the Kuroshio front and 
the subarctic (Oyashio) front.  The Kuroshio front 
borders on the Kuroshio Extension, with current 
speeds up to 3 m/s.  The Oyashio front is a water-
mass front between cold, low-salinity subarctic 
waters and warm, saline subtropical waters (Zhang 
and Hanawa, 1992).  Temperature and salinity 
differences across that front compensate in their 
influence on the density; horizontal density 
gradients are small and so is the velocity at the 
front (Roden, 1972, 1977). 
 
 Numerical model results should at least 
resemble the kind of flow pattern seen in Fig. 8. 
They should ensure detachment of the Kuroshio at 
the correct latitude, include a branch of the 
Oyashio along the coast of Japan, reproduce the 
double front structure, and transfer warm water 
 7
across the frontal zone well east of the Japanese 
coast.  
 
 Semtner and Chervin's (1992) global 1/2 ° 
eddy-resolving, 20-level model gave a more 
realistic output than previous coarser resolution 
models.  It showed a bifurcated Kuroshio 
Extension similar to observations.  Frontal 
analyses comparing model products with 
observations however put the Kuroshio Extension 
about 5 ° south of observations (Garzoli et al., 
1992) and yielded unrealistically strong currents at 
the subarctic front.  The Oyashio coastal 
southward flow is not reproduced in that model 
and northward flow from the Kuroshio Extension 
is instead dominant near the east coast of Japan. 
Variability in the Kuroshio Extension was not 
consistent with GEOSAT observations, although 
model kinetic energy levels were comparable to 
that of observations (Garaffo et al., 1992). Semtner 
and Chervin (1992) concluded that their model 
resolution was insufficient to reproduce the details 
of the circulation in that area.  The 3.5 layer, 1/2 ° 
resolution wind-driven model of Metzger et al. 
(1992) also exhibits the required double front 
structure, but was not compared in detail with 
observations in this region.  In observations (Fig. 
8) the northward flow from the Kuroshio 
Extension to the Oyashio (subarctic front) is 
separated from the east coast of Japan, a feature 
simulated by Hurlburt et al. (1992, 1996), and 
shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 9.  Hurlburt et al. (1996) 
find that this occurs because the bottom 
topography reduces the separation between the 
Oyashio and the Kuroshio Extension.  However, 
baroclinic instability, and hence an eddy-resolving 
model, is essential for the upper-ocean 
topographic coupling that allows this to occur.  
 
 The Oyashio coastal branch is an 
important feature of the Kuroshio/Oyashio 
confluence region.  The cold and relatively fresh 
waters which it carries southwards are thought to 
be important in the formation of North Pacific 
Intermediate Waters (Yasuda et al., 1995).  The 
coastal environment on the northeast coast of 
Japan is significantly influenced by the presence 
of the coastal Oyashio branch.  There is important 
seasonal and interannual variability in the 
southernmost latitude reached by this current 
(Ogawa et al., 1987).  There is evidence for 
decadal-scale fluctuations and a 3-4 year cycle 
possibly linked to ENSO events (Takasugi and 
Yasuda, 1994).  There are also years of extreme 
cold waters, observed in the spring (Okuda, 1986).  
In spite of the importance of the Oyashio coastal 
branch, no model fully reproduces its presence and 
variability, although the Hurlburt et al. (1996) 1/8 ° 
and 1/16 ° models represent significant progress in 
explaining these phenomena. 
 
c.  Kuroshio Extension 
 
 The Kuroshio Extension is that part of the 
Kuroshio travelling eastward after detachment 
from the Japanese coast.  It is an area of great 
meandering and eddying motion, at the southern 
edge of the Kuroshio/Oyashio confluence region. 
This region has received modelling attention in the 
past and has recently been the focus of intense 
efforts through the Kuroshio Extension Regional 
Experiment (Hogan et al., 1992; Hurlburt et 
al.,1992, 1996;  Jacobs et al., 1995; Mitchell et 
al., 1995) and the Megapolygon Experiment, 
conducted by Russian scientists in 1987 (Ivanov, 
1992).  Typical results, shown in Fig. 9, show that 
eddy-resolving models do produce circulation 
patterns which are generally consistent with what 
is observed.  General statistical comparisons 
would include the latitude of maximum current 
and of maximum eddy activity. It would also 
include simulation of the mean meanders east of 
Japan shown in Figs. 1, 4 and 8.  Because the 
meandering and eddy generation associated with 
the Kuroshio Extension is due to flow instabilities 
and is not a determininstic response to atmospheric 
forcing, a detailed comparison of synoptic flow 
patterns would require model initialization using 
observational data which can resolve mesoscale 
features such as those in Fig. 9.  Carnes et al. 
(1995) have attempted to do this using satellite 
altimeter data, front and eddy locations from 
satellite infra-red imagery and 4-D data 
assimilation.  Problems associated with this kind 
of exacting comparison are discussed under the 
section Variability below.   
 
 Hurlburt et al. (1996) find that the latitude 
of the Kuroshio Extension is associated with the 
winter-time zero wind stress curl.  Both the 
 8
Hellerman and Rosenstein (HR) monthly wind-
stress climatology and a monthly climatology 
derived from the European Centre for Medium-
range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 1000 mb 
winds have been used to drive their 1/8 ° 6-layer 
Pacific model. East of about 150 °E the two wind 
climatologies give a mean latitude for the 
Kuroshio Extension in the model which differ by 
about 3 ° of latitude: approximately 34 °N for the 
HR winds (Fig. 4) and 37 °N for ECMWF winds 
(Fig. 30).  The observed latitude is 35 °N.  In 
addition, Hurlburt et al. (1996) find that the mean 
meanders east of Japan are associated with the 
trench and seamounts east of where the Kuroshio 
separates from the coast. Again, the upper ocean-
topographic coupling is achieved via baroclinic 
instability.  
 
 
d.  The Alaskan Gyre 
 
 Another region of special interest is the 
northeast Pacific, where the West Wind Drift 
bifurcates into the Alaska Gyre and the California 
Current.  Model results (see Figs. 4 and 5) do, of 
course, reproduce the bifurcation.  There is also 
considerable seasonal variability in the current 
systems of the eastern boundary area. Surface 
current patterns have been traditionally linked to 
large-scale seasonal wind variations.  During 
summer months, coastal upwelling conditions 
prevail north from California as far north as the 
Queen Charlotte Islands;  during winter months, 
upwelling no longer occurs and the Davidson 
Current is found inshore of the main subtropical 
gyre.  
 
 The Gulf of Alaska is also a region 
characterized by abundant precipitation.  Strong 
fresh water runoff, from the Columbia River 
northward, contributes to a coastal buoyancy-
driven current which gradually joins the 
anticyclonic Alaska Gyre (Royer, 1981; Hickey et 
al., 1991).  The fresh water inflow is partly 
recirculated within the Alaska Gyre and 
contributes to the relative freshness of subarctic 
North Pacific waters and the strong halocline 
found especially in the east.  
 
 Regional models of the northeast Pacific 
(Cummins, 1989, 1991; Cummins and Mysak, 
1988; Cummins and Freeland, 1993; Lee et al., 
1992) have explored links between variability of 
the Alaska Gyre, wind-forcing and bathymetry. 
Mesoscale eddy activity is much weaker than in 
the western North Pacific, but eddies are 
nevertheless present (Matthews et al., 1992; 
Thomson et al., 1990).  Some features, like the 
Sitka Eddy (Tabata, 1982;  Swaters and Mysak, 
1985), may be related to bottom topography; 
others may arise from the generation of Rossby 
waves on the coast of North America (Cummins et 
al., 1986;  Jacobs et al., 1993;  Melsom et al., 
1995). 
 
 Measurements made on the continental 
shelf have illustrated the richness of variability 
associated with direct wind forcing, shelf waves 
and runoff pulses in an eastern boundary layer 
(e.g., Mooers and Smith, 1968;  Huyer et al., 
1975;  Hsieh, 1982; Hickey et al., 1991). Early 
models often focussed on recognition of particular 
types of wave or instability phenomenon;  efforts 
have also been made at explaining observed 
variability in terms of these phenomena and of 
local as well as distant forcing (Gill and Schuman, 
1974;  Hickey and Hamilton, 1980;  Halliwell 
and Allen, 1984;  Federiuk and Allen, 1995).  
 
 Coastal temperatures are deemed to be 
strongly influenced by El Niño (Mysak, 1986). 
The high resolution North Pacific model of Jacobs 
et al. (1994) does reveal the propagation of coastal 
Kelvin waves northwards from the equator along 
the North American coast, as have earlier studies 
(e.g., Johnson and O'Brien, 1990).  There has 
long been discussion as to whether coastal 
temperature changes are associated mainly with 
local perturbations in atmospheric forcing or with 
the effect of these Kelvin waves (Hamilton and 
Emery, 1985). Recent calculations using the 1/8 ° 
model of Hurlburt et al. (1996), show that 
interannual fluctuations of sea level off southern 
Alaska (Fig. 10) are well reproduced by the model 
and that enhanced mesoscale activity in the Gulf 
of Alaska (such as the Sitka Eddy) follows upon 
El Niño activity (Melsom et al., 1995). 
 
 9
 While the sharp surface halocline of the 
Alaskan gyre is a strong obstacle to ventilation, 
Van Scoy et al. (1991) have suggested that winter-
time forcing might sometimes be strong enough to 
overcome the potential energy of the halocline and 
that the 26.8 density surface might outcrop in the 
Alaskan gyre, either in multiple small areas in 
response to storm forcing or infrequently in large 
areas in response to interannual fluctuations of the 
wind stress.  Using time series of tritium 
concentration at Station P, Van Scoy and Druffel 
(1993) suggest that ventilation to the density of the 
NPIW occurs within the Alaskan gyre during El 
Niño years.  
 
3.1.3  Variability    
 
 As we have already indicated in some 
instances, what is most poorly understood and 
modeled in all areas is the variability of the 
circulation.  Understanding of the extent and 
nature of the variability in turn affects 
interpretation of the data and the definition of the 
mean circulation.  We distinguish three types of 
variations in ocean properties and circulation:  (i) 
- changes directly related to atmospheric forcing, 
with time-scales on the order of a week and spatial 
scales of hundreds of kilometers;  (ii) - smaller 
scale features, with time scales of weeks to 
months: eddies, rings and meanders;  (iii) - longer 
term, seasonal and interannual variations which 
shift the axes of currents and modify their strength 
and their water properties.   
 
 Weather forcing consists of the response 
of the upper ocean to momentum and energy 
exchange across the sea surface.  This response 
may be represented through local effects in so-
called upper-layer models (Large et al., 1994) or 
incorporated directly as input to more complex 
three-dimensional models.  We are not discussing 
here the high-frequency inertial oscillations 
associated with the passage of storms and changes 
in wind speed and direction.  On the scale of 
atmospheric weather systems, the ocean responds 
by moving under the wind's influence and by 
changing its surface properties in response to 
mixing and heat exchange with the atmosphere.  
Predicting the meteorologically forced ocean 
response is clearly limited in time by the skill of 
weather forecasting.  However, the effect of free 
waves initiated by atmospheric forcing may be 
predictable on much longer, perhaps decadal time 
scales (Jacobs et al., 1994). 
 
 Eddies and meanders.  Mesoscale 
variability is mostly, but not exclusively, 
associated with regions of strong shear.  We have 
already noted the presence of large meanders in 
the path of the Kuroshio and of eddies and 
meanders in the Kuroshio extension and in the 
Oyashio.  The Alaskan Stream region, off the 
Aleutian Islands, is another region of intense eddy 
activity, as is the Kamchatka Current.  We have 
noted above that mesoscale eddies are also found 
in a region of weaker currents, in the Gulf of 
Alaska.  
 
 It is one thing to model the mean 
circulation, it is another to actually reproduce the 
eddies and meanders.  All models with sufficient 
resolution do reproduce zones of high eddy kinetic 
energy generally where it is observed in nature.  
As a first test of the ability of models to reproduce 
the appropriate level of eddy kinetic energy, one 
may compare statistics of their eddy-generating 
ability to observations.  The most suitable data 
sets for comparison are those of satellite altimetry, 
as used by Hogan et al. (1992) and Hurlburt et al. 
(1992, 1995b, 1996), who showed some 
compatibility between one model and some 
observations in the Kuroshio Extension region.   
 
 As noted earlier in our discussion of the 
path of the Kuroshio, the exact shape of meanders 
and eddies is sensitive to a variety of physical 
effects and to the details of model structure.  
Furthermore, the actual eddies observed at any one 
time are partially the result of the recent history of 
the upstream flow pattern:  there is a strong 
dependence, in the model as in the ocean, on 
initial conditions.  Fig. 11 illustrates the 
dependence of the spatial variability on various 
physical parameters.  
 
 The task of correctly predicting the 
evolution of mesoscale oceanic variability (e.g. of 
individual meanders, eddies and eddy-shedding 
events) is analogous to that of atmospheric 
weather prediction.  The difference is that the 
 10
time and space scales of oceanic mesoscale 
variability are quite different from those of the 
atmosphere.  With spatial scales of tens of 
kilometres, much greater spatial resolution is 
required to model oceanic mesoscale variability.  
Time scales of weeks to months offer a wider 
prediction window than in the atmosphere, 
provided the effects of direct meteorological 
forcing are not dominant.  Satellite remote 
sensing can, in some cases, provide sufficiently 
dense information for data assimilation into ocean 
models and operational prediction.  A number of 
attempts have shown that sea surface altimetry can 
indeed be successfully assimilated into high-
resolution models of active eddying regions, like 
the Gulf Stream (De Mey and Ménard, 1989) and 
the California current (White et al., 1990).  A 
recent evaluation of forecast skills by Fox et al. 
(1993) shows that Gulf Stream forecasts of up to 
two weeks are possible.  Lai et al. (1994) in their 
assessment of forecasting success, emphasized the 
importance of starting with the right initial 
conditions, assimilating data correctly and 
successfully parameterizing sub-grid scale 
phenomena.  Early attempts to apply similar 
techniques to the Pacific Ocean have yielded 
encouraging results (Carnes et al., 1995).  
Sometimes, under clear skies, high resolution sea 
surface temperature maps may also be used to 
enhance the data base.  This is an area of rapid 
and important development in marine modelling. 
 
 Seasonal and Interannual Variability.  
The path of the Kuroshio, the extension of the 
Oyashio coastal branch, the latitude of the Alaska 
- California Current bifurcation and the strength of 
the Alaskan Gyre are all subject to longer term 
variability.  In the upper layer, some of this 
variability is found to be closely linked with direct 
meteorological inputs at seasonal and interannual 
to interdecadal scales.  Recent climate modelling 
studies are convincing us that long-term oceanic 
variation is one of the active components of the 
global air-sea coupled system, as apparent in 
interdecadal scale climate variations (Trenberth 
and Hurrell, 1994).  We refer to this link in a later 
section.  
 
 Connections with the ENSO phenomenon 
have already been mentioned above. Recent 
numerical simulations (Jacobs et al., 1994) suggest 
that the influence of the 1982/83 El Niño may 
perhaps extend over more than a decade in the 
North Pacific, propagating up the east coast of 27 
the ocean as a Kelvin wave and travelling 
westward as baroclinic Rossby waves.  Decadal 
and interdecadal variations are important in the 
atmosphere (Kitoh, 1991), in the sea-surface 
temperature (Yukimoto et al., 1995) and in the 
temperature and salinity of the upper 500 m of the 
ocean (Watanabe et al., 1994).  Hurlburt et al. 
(1996) simulate a decadal time scale flow 
instability in the Kuroshio Extension that requires 
an eddy-resolving basin-scale model.  The first 
EOF of the observed long-term sea surface 
temperature (SST) shows that both on the ENSO 
time scale and on a  decadal time scale there are 
clear signals on a pan-Pacific scale (Fig. 12). 
Kitoh (1991) indicated in his atmospheric general 
circulation model (AGCM) simulation that the 
interannual and interdecadal variations of the 
intensity of the Aleutian Low, and consequently 
the cyclonic surface wind stress on the sea surface, 
are mostly results of teleconnections with similar 
variations of the central tropical Pacific associated 
with ENSO.  Miller et al. (1994) simulated such 
oceanic variations in middle to high latitudes using 
observed wind stress and heat flux anomalies.  
The study of the impact of this type of climatic 
variations on ocean dynamics and on oceanic heat 
transport is an active field of research in ocean 
modelling. 
 
 A key criterion for climate change 
modelling, which is concerned with statistical 
properties rather than synoptic details, is not the 
predictive skill of the model for interannual 
variability, but whether a model has a realistic 
spatial and temporal spectrum of variability at 
these time scales.  Global ocean-only models have 
shown realistic modes of interannual variability 
when forced with observed forcing (e.g. Chao and 
Philander, 1993;  Jacobs et al., 1994;  Zhang and 
Endoh, 1994), though it is clear that a model must 
possess adequate resolution in the tropical region 
in order to avoid distorting the important 
equatorial Kelvin and Rossby waves. There are 
also many additional areas of concern (Stockdale 
et al., 1993).  Philander et al. (1992) noted that 
low-resolution ocean models may not be capable 
 11
of representing the important mechanisms of 
ENSO, though in coupled systems they do possess 
distinctive modes of oscillation. Recent 
hypotheses suggest that decadal variability in the 
Pacific may be either linked to the El Niño/La 
Niña signal in the equatorial Pacific (Trenberth 
and Hurrell, 1994) or to midlatitude air-sea 
instabilities (Latif and Barnett, 1994).  
 
 A useful summary of the nature and 
predictability of oceanic variability is reproduced 
as Table 1 (from Hurlburt, 1984).  
 
3.1.4  Water properties 
 
 The subarctic North Pacific is 
characterized by the presence of a rather brackish, 
approximately 100 m deep, upper layer.  This 
layer extends south to a broad front which defines 
the subarctic boundary region eastward of the 
western boundary current region (Fig. 1).  The 
brackish upper layer owes its existence to the 
excess of precipitation over evaporation over the 
subarctic North Pacific as well as to the inflow of 
freshwater from many coastal rivers.  In addition, 
the upper layer is subject to seasonal thermal 
stratification.  The northern marginal seas 
(Bering, Okhotsk) are also the site of extensive ice 
formation.  Buoyancy fluxes through lateral 
boundaries (including marginal seas) and the sea 
surface are the main factors in determining near-
surface water properties over most of the subarctic 
north Pacific.  Advection plays an important role 
in spatially limited, but nevertheless very 
important areas, such as the Kuroshio/Oyashio 
confluence area, where strong horizontal mixing 
occurs.  
 Extensive modelling of the seasonal 
thermocline has focussed on subarctic North 
Pacific waters (Denman and Miyake, 1973; 
Martin, 1985;  Gaspar et al., 1990;  Thomas et 
al., 1993).  A common technique, which has often 
been found satisfactory, has been to ignore 
advection entirely and to describe the evolution of 
the thermocline by using a 1-D model which 
includes air-sea exchanges and a parameterization 
of vertical mixing.  This kind of model could then 
be attached to a 3-D ocean model to describe the 
evolution of its upper layer temperature. Large et 
al. (1994) have reviewed the limitations of upper 
layer models, which they find generally 
inadequate, even in areas of weak advection.  
 
 When advection is important, it must be 
included in the evolution of upper layer properties.  
Cherniawsky and Holloway (1991, 1993) have 
examined various effects on the details of water 
property distributions in the Kuroshio/Oyashio 
extension region, using a 2.5 layer primitive-
equations model with resolution of 1 ° in latitude 
and 1.5 ° in longitude. Cherniawsky et al. (1990) 
coupled a sea-ice model to the above to extend the 
realism of the model.  The circulation which 
results is not quite realistic, particularly in not 
yielding a coastal branch of the Oyashio. 
 
 Existing models are thought not to do very 
well with respect to the distribution and generation 
of water properties, most markedly in the 
Kuroshio-Oyashio region.  Improvements in 
model resolution, in the specification of 
atmospheric forcing, in the understanding of the 
exchange with neighbouring, especially coastal, 
basins and in mixed-layer physics are necessary to 
improve the situation.  We will return to this point 
in our discussion of intermediate-water formation 
and circulation. 
 
3.2  Intermediate circulation  
 
 The intermediate waters of the subarctic 
Pacific may be defined with reference to T-S 
properties shown in Fig. 13.  An examination of 
this figure reveals several important properties of 
the North Pacific.  First, there are two main parts 
to the T-S diagram.  Subpolar gyre stations show 
a T-S relation that begins in shallow water with 
relatively low salinities, near 33.0, and low 
temperatures, near 4 °C, and extends to very cold 
(1 °C) and saline (34.7) water in the deepest 
portions of the water column.  Subtropical gyre 
stations, on the other hand, show relatively warm 
and saline surface waters (34.2, > 10 °C), a mid-
depth salinity minimum near potential density of 
26.8, and deeper water similar to that of the 
subpolar gyre.  The subtropical salinity minimum 
defines the water usually called the North Pacific 
Intermediate Water (NPIW).  The mechanism of 
formation of this minimum observed in the 
subtropical gyre is not well-understood, but it 
 12
seems clear that it is related somehow to the 
mixing of subpolar water across the subtropical-
subpolar frontal boundary in the western North 
Pacific, followed by advection and diffusion into 
the subtropical gyre interior. 
 
 A number of studies (i.e., Talley, 1993) 
show that isopycnal surfaces at potential densities 
greater than 26.6 are not generally in contact with 
the atmosphere in the open North Pacific at any 
time of the year, effectively eliminating direct air-
sea interaction as a possible agent in the formation 
of the subtropical salinity minimum.  (Although, 
as we have noted earlier, there has been some 
suggestion of ventilation within the Alaskan gyre).  
Furthermore, at potential densities greater than 
about 27.4 the T-S characteristics of the subpolar 
and subtropical gyres become virtually 
indistinguishable.  For this reason, a useful 
definition of the intermediate layer of the North 
Pacific is the layer lying between potential 
densities of 26.7 and 27.4.  A useful map of the 
salinity on the central NPIW surface within this 
layer is given in the classic work of Reid (1965) 
(Fig. 14).  Modelling of the intermediate 
circulation of the subarctic North Pacific thus 
includes a strong emphasis on the formation and 
distribution of the NPIW.  
 
 During most of the year the minimum 
salinity in the subpolar water column is at the sea 
surface, mainly due to the relatively low 
evaporation rate at the surface of the North Pacific 
compared to other oceans (Warren, 1983), while in 
the subtropical gyre the minimum salinity in the 
water column is generally located in the 
intermediate layer, near sigma-theta of 26.8.  As 
noted above, however, the two gyres must be 
connected at that level, since the water in the 
subtropical salinity minimum clearly at least 
partially originated in the subpolar gyre (this was 
already represented in Sverdrup et al, 1942;  Fig. 
15).  The present generation of numerical models 
does not adequately reproduce these large-scale T-
S features, and indeed many existing models do 
not produce a subtropical salinity minimum at all.  
Modelling the distributions of ocean properties, 
like temperature and salinity, which affect density 
and hence circulation is a pre-requisite to the 
development of models which can follow tracers 
and pollutants.  Building accurate models of the 
North Pacific that produce the gross large-scale 
characteristics of both the subtropical and subpolar 
gyres, and the interaction between them, is clearly 
a high priority for the future of Pacific Ocean 
modelling. 
 
 The formation mechanism of the NPIW 
has puzzled oceanographers for a long time 
(Sverdrup et al., 1942;  Hasunuma, 1978;  Talley, 
1993) and Talley et al. (1995) have reviewed 
recent ideas on the process of formation of NPIW, 
in the area which encompasses the 
Kuroshio/Oyashio confluence, northeast of Japan. 
Fig. 16 shows a schematic diagram of the currents 
and features involved in the process, whereby 
waters advected from the Oyashio, the Kuroshio 
and from the Sea of Japan through Tsugaru Strait 
mix, under atmospheric forcing, to create NPIW.   
 
 Modelling the formation of NPIW is a 
major challenge! Fukasawa et al. (1992) 
developed an inverse model which uses Levitus's 
data (1982) to estimate transport on isopycnal 
surfaces at intermediate depths (Fig. 17).  Results 
show a basin-scale circulation, as expected, and a 
source in the Oyashio-Kuroshio mixing region. 
Two source regions have however been suggested 
for the origin of the low salinity water which 
forms the core of the NPIW:  the first is the 
Oyashio/Kuroshio mixing region (Talley and 
Nagata, 1993;  Yasuda et al., 1995);  the other is 
a process of direct spontaneous ventilation of 
sigma-theta 26.8 water in the Alaskan gyre (Van 
Scoy et al., 1991).  Yamanaka et al.'s (1995) 
model shows that water supplies from both the 
Bering and the Okhotsk Seas are necessary to 
create the salinity minimum structure and support 
the first region as a more likely source.  Qiu 
(1995) has presented a local model which tries to 
explain the salinity minimum structure in terms of 
the surrounding water masses.  There is not 
universal agreement on the reliability of model 
results and a need for better resolution and better 
control of diffusion parameters has been 
expressed. Models developed do not exhibit the 
sharp sub-polar/sub-tropical front seen in nature. 
There is also little confidence in the amounts of 
NPIW produced.  It is suggested that additional 
tracers (beyond salt) should be used to test the 
 13
intermediate circulation;  freons, for example, 
might provide useful information of water age and 
path.  
 
 There is more to the intermediate 
circulation than the spreading of NPIW. 
Yamanaka et al. (1994) have performed 
experiments with an Ocean General Circulation 
Model with and without surface wind forcing for 
the same surface climatological temperature and 
salinity conditions.  In the absence of the wind 
stress, the remaining thermohaline circulation is 
only 10 to 20% of what is found in the presence of 
wind forcing.  This result shows that the NPIW is 
at a depth where wind forcing circulation is still 
important in determining the circulation.  
 
3.3  Deep and bottom circulation 
 
 Available information indicates that one 
should think of the circulation in the subarctic 
North Pacific as consisting of at least four layers: 
surface, intermediate, deep and bottom.  The layer 
below the main pycnocline needs to be divided 
into deep and bottom layers because most of the 
northward flowing water (Lower Circumpolar 
Water) returns southward as a mid-depth flow of 
Pacific Deep Water (Fiadeiro, 1982;  Johnson and 
Toole, 1993).     
 
 When discussing the deep and bottom 
circulation, exchanges with more southerly areas 
of the Pacific and with other oceans become 
extremely important, since at those depths, the 
primarily thermohaline circulation is linked to the 
global "conveyor belt" whose structure remains 
mysterious in many areas, and which is perhaps 
better represented through a more complicated 
diagram than a simple "belt", such as that shown 
in Fig. 18.  Schmitz (1995) provides a recent 
summary of observational knowledge of the global 
thermohaline circulation. An interpretation of deep 
flows into the North Pacific, at 4,000 m and 5,000 
m, by Kawabe and Taira (1995) is shown in Fig. 
19.  This figure clearly reveals the general 
western boundary current nature of the deep 
circulation and the channeling influence of the 
large scale bathymetry.  The absence of any 
information over wide areas is also striking.   
 
 Exchanges between the Pacific and the 
Southern Ocean have been discussed in global 
model results (Gill and Bryan, 1971;  Cox, 1989; 
Semtner and Chervin, 1992;  Ishikawa et al.,1993;  
Toggweiler and Samuels, 1993, Ishizaki, 1994;  
Shriver and Hurlburt, 1995) and are still not well 
enough understood.  Model results from Ishizaki 
(1994), seen in Fig. 20, do however show some 
general similarity with what is known of the flow.  
Exchanges across the equatorial Pacific have been 
modelled by Suginohara and Fukasawa (1988) and 
Suginohara and Aoki (1991), whose results exhibit 
a complex vertical structure of "stacked jets" along 
the equator whose nature remains controversial 
(Wang, 1995) and which seem difficult to 
reconcile with observations such as those of Firing 
(1989).   
 
 Models suggest that the combined effects 
of baroclinic instability and bottom topography are 
very important in the Kuroshio/Oyashio extension 
region (Hurlburt et al., 1995b, c, 1996).  The 
bottom topography is an important factor in 
steering deep flows and regulating the distribution 
and intensity of baroclinic instability. The 
baroclinic instability drives abyssal flows, 
including eddy-driven deep mean flows, which are 
then constrained to follow f/h contours of the 
bottom topography (with f the Coriolis parameter 
and h the ocean depth).  The abyssal flow in turn 
tends to steer the upper ocean flow, including the 
mean path of the Kuroshio/Oyashio extension. 
Eddy-driven deep mean flows from the model are 
consistent with mean abyssal currents measured in 
the Kuroshio Extension Regional Experiment in 
the region where the Kuroshio separates from the 
coast of Japan (Hallock and Teague, 1995).  
 
 The influence of unresolved eddies on 
bottom interactions has been discussed by 
Holloway (1992) and Eby and Holloway (1994). 
Their method for including such "topographic 
stresses" yields considerably different circulation 
patterns at depth.  We shall return to this point 
when discussing possible improvements to model 
physics.

3.4  Assessment 
 
 It is tempting to be impressed by the 
results of models such as those depicted in Fig. 9, 
which reproduce the main features of the subarctic 
North Pacific circulation and considerable realistic 
detail of the circulation in some of the most 
complex areas within the domain.  While the 
achievements of state-of-the-art, eddy resolving 
models are impressive, they nevertheless are just 
beginning to reproduce characteristic features of 
the western boundary currents and their region of 
interaction, such as the latitude of detachment of 
the Kuroshio and the frontal region of the 
Kuroshio Extension. They are still incapable of 
properly simulating water mass properties of the 
upper layer and the properties and positions of 
important fronts in vigorous mixing regions such 
as the Oyashio-Kuroshio confluence.  Model 
results for the deeper and abyssal circulation are 
difficult to assess since there are few 
measurements at great depths. 
 
 Circulation modelling has made rapid 
progress in recent years, and in particular, the 
results of the high resolution models described, for 
example, by Hurlburt et al. (1996) are very 
encouraging and suggest that many of the 
deficiencies currently identified in model results 
will soon be corrected.  These deficiencies are 
associated with the representation of physical 
processes, atmospheric forcing, boundary 
conditions at contacts with marginal seas, and 
other data deficiencies.  These we shall consider 
in turn.  
 
 For convenience a list of physical models 
of large-scale circulation and their general 
characteristics is presented in Table 2. 
 
 15
4.0 PHYSICAL PROCESSES 
 
 While ad-hoc, correlative models may 
sometimes do a good job at predicting some 
natural phenomena, experience in atmospheric 
sciences and in oceanographic modelling shows 
clearly that better physics yields better and more 
reliable results.  We have already alluded to a 
number of situations where physical understanding 
is lacking. These will now be discussed in more 
detail.  
 
 Model physics include first a correct 
formulation of the basic physical principles which 
control fluid motion and the changes in fluid 
properties.  Difficulties in arriving at a correct 
formulation start with the discretization of the 
computational domain, which forces the 
representation of unresolved physical phenomena 
through some kind of parameterization.  Even in 
eddy-resolving models, there remain sub-grid-
scale phenomena, such as salt-fingering, cabelling, 
waves, tides, turbulence, inertial motions, sharp 
fronts, etc...which are either completely neglected 
or included into some exchange parameter such as 
an "eddy-viscosity". Sometimes, a more 
complicated scheme is used, which attempts to 
relate the state of the modeled flow and that of 
smaller scale properties through some closure 
hypothesis.  
 
 Because such problems are an important 
challenge to ocean modelling, they were very 
much on the mind of members of Working Group 
7.  Nevertheless, because of their generic nature, 
they will receive only passing attention here, 
focusing on a few points of particular pertinence to 
the subarctic North Pacific.  We return briefly to 
numerical techniques in the last section of this 
chapter.   
 
Resolution 
 
 As discussed earlier, problems of 
resolution are particularly important where strong 
flows interact with bottom topography.  Another 
situation is the eastward penetration of inertial jets 
such as the Kuroshio Extension and their 
associated high variability.  This is illustrated in 
Fig. 21 by a comparison of simulations at 1/8 ° and 
1/16 ° resolution.  It has been argued that 
mesoscale resolution in the probable formation 
region of NPIW (and perhaps in other areas) is not 
sufficient to identify and characterize major 
mixing processes.  Increasing the resolution is one 
way to deal with this problem.  The development 
of bigger and faster supercomputers has allowed 
great progress in this direction.  In an area such as 
the subarctic North Pacific, where marginal seas, 
shelf regions and boundary currents are important 
and need to be modeled at a greater resolution, 
there is a need for techniques which can provide 
variable resolution.  Possible classes of 
techniques in this regard include the nesting of 
different grid meshes (Spall and Holland, 1991) 
and the use of unstructured gridding techniques 
such as finite and spectral finite elements 
(Iskandarani et al, 1994).  The enhanced-
resolution capabilities of these new techniques will 
be particularly significant for programs, such as 
GLOBEC and others, which emphasize regional 
physical/chemical/biological interactions.  The 
other way to deal with inadequate resolution is to 
improve the parameterization of sub-grid scale 
phenomena, particularly mixing, to which we 
return below. 
 
 High vertical resolution is required in 
regions where important physical phenomena take 
place on small vertical scales:  in the upper, wind-
influenced layer, and in some areas where sharp 
pycnoclines occur.  Particular cases include the 
fitting of upper layer models to the top of large 
scale ocean models, an issue already raised above;  
and ice modelling. 
 
Partial models 
 
 What we call a "partial model" is a model 
which focuses on a range of depths or densities:  
the upper, wind-influenced layer, or the salinity-
minimum layer, and does not solve for the whole 
thickness of the ocean.  (This is an unusual 
terminology, but one which does not raise 
confusion with "layer" and "level" models.) This 
kind of model requires boundary conditions at its 
upper or lower boundary, or both, from ocean 
layers above or below it.  
 16
 Because of the need for enhanced 
resolution near the surface, a detailed upper-layer 
model which handles the physics of air-sea 
interactions is sometimes matched to a semi-
passive deeper ocean or to an active fully three-
dimensional model.  Cherniawsky and Holloway 
(1991, 1993) have examined the response of the 
upper layer of the North Pacific to a variety of 
surface forcing regimes using this kind of 
approach.  Sterl and Kattenberg (1994) have 
embedded a mixed-layer model into an ocean 
general circulation model of the Atlantic.  This 
kind of approach is important and requires further 
experimentation, especially where air-sea interface 
fluxes are important.  
 
 Large-scale upwelling associated with 
Ekman suction is important in the eastern and the 
western subarctic Pacific, due to the influence of 
the prevailing atmospheric systems, such as the 
Aleutian low.  Gradual nutrient replenishment 
associated with this process, as well as direct wind 
mixing, is thought to be important in determining 
marine productivity.  However the situation is 
complicated;  both upwelling and downwelling 
occur over the subarctic region. Judging from 
oxygen distributions, upwelling seems to be 
significant only in the upper layers. Distributions 
of other tracers, such as CFC's and tritium may 
also shed light on vertical water movements and 
need to be better understood (Van Scoy et al., 
1991).    
 
 Modelling the intermediate layer 
circulation requires information about flows into it 
from above and below, which may perhaps be 
obtained from a meteorologically driven upper-
layer above;  there is however no good 
information on the distribution and variability of 
the large scale deep upwelling velocity below.  
 
Ice modelling 
 
 The mechanical and thermodynamic 
processes which regulate the growth and retreat of 
sea ice are inadequately represented in current 
large-scale ocean circulation models.  Although 
some success has been reported in coarse-
resolution coupled ice/ocean modelling of, for 
example, the Arctic Ocean (Fleming and Semtner, 
1991), available ice models have known 
deficiencies at the higher resolutions necessary to 
resolve processes in partially ice-covered regions 
such as the Japan, Okhotsk and Bering Seas.  
Alternate treatments of sea ice dynamics and 
thermodynamics need exploration, both in 
idealized settings and in fully coupled high-
resolution basin-scale models of the North Pacific.  
In particular, small scale prediction of ice cover is 
extremely important for navigational purposes in 
the marginal sea areas.   
 
Topographic stress 
 
 There is always a practical limit to 
increasing resolution.  Holloway (1992) has 
pioneered a different approach, which considers 
interactions between unresolved eddies and the 
bathymetry in terms of statistical principles. 
Holloway (1992) and Eby and Holloway (1994) 
suggested that relaxation of flows towards a 
statistical highest entropy state rather than towards 
a state of rest might lead to more realistic 
representations of topographic stress. Fig. 22  
shows a comparison between currents at a depth of 
2,880 m obtained in the usual fashion and those 
obtained when imposing relaxation to a statistical 
state.  The deep currents are much stronger in the 
second case and, in some areas,  in different 
directions.  The Deep Western Boundary Current 
in the Shikoku Basin, off Japan, is much stronger 
in the second model and more in keeping with the 
measurements of Fukasawa et al. (1986).  While 
this approach is relevant to all ocean models, it is 
also a clear example of the need for further work 
in representing ocean physics in numerical 
models, and especially in modelling deep currents.    
 
Mixing processes 
 
 Many problems of small scale physics 
identified as relevant to the subarctic North Pacific 
relate to the parameterization of mixing of water 
properties at sub-grid scales, a point which we 
have already alluded to earlier.  The idea of 
isopycnal diffusion is based on movement of water 
particles carrying their salinity and temperature by 
steady subgrid-scale geostrophic neutral eddies.  
An unstable or decaying eddy mixing (also double 
diffusion) has a diapycnal component.  Accurate 
 17
modelling of diapycnal fluxes (across isopycnal 
surfaces) is a necessary pre-requisite for the 
representation of thermohaline processes, 
including water mass formation and conversion.  
It seems that the representation of the diffusivity 
tensor as being diagonal with respect to principal 
axes lying in local isopycnal surfaces is necessary 
for meeting this requirement.  (The diapycnal and 
along-isopycnal diffusivities differ by many order 
of magnitudes.)  While this can be done in fixed-
level coordinate models, the necessary 
introduction of horizontal numerical diffusion 
cancels the effects of diffusivity tensor rotation 
and re-introduces a spuriously high effective 
diapycnal diffusivity, especially where isopycnal 
surfaces slope strongly, as in strong boundary 
currents (Redi, 1982;  McDougall and Church, 
1988).  A more natural vehicle for representing 
diapycnal diffusive processes in the ocean is the 
isopycnal-layer model, in which potential density, 
or some other suitable variable, is used as a 
vertical coordinate in place of the geometric depth 
(deSzoeke and Bennett, 1993;  deSzoeke, 1995).  
In a numerical model based on isopycnal 
coordinates the diapycnal diffusion can be very 
accurately controlled.  This feature is a necessary 
requirement for developing models of water mass 
formation and transformation.  Gent and 
McWilliams (1990) have discussed the same 
situation in terms of an "eddy-induced transport 
velocity" which arises from the skew-symmetric 
component of a 3x3 tensor which parameterizes 
the effect of oceanic eddy motions.  Gent et al. 
(1995) have shown that this parameterization 
yields results consistent with observed meridional 
heat transport.  
 
Vortex interactions 
 
 The energetic regions east and south of 
Japan are areas where meanders form and travel 
along the Kuroshio and the Oyashio, and where  
rings are created and transport water masses across 
frontal zones (Yasuda et al., 1992; Yasuda, 1995).  
Even in models where these features are resolved, 
there is a lack of clear practical understanding of 
the dynamics of ring and vortex interactions and of 
their interaction with stratification and frontal 
zones.  Further analysis of such features and their 
interactions would shed light on the behaviour of 
these complex regions.  
 
Numerical Methods 
 
 Model configuration (multi-level, multi-
layer; spectral; sigma-coordinates...) discretization 
methods (finite differences, elements, irregular or 
nested grids...) and numerical techniques can have 
a strong influence on the quality of the solutions of 
geophysical hydrodynamic problems.  The 
solutions obtained should be as physically faithful 
as possible, without numerical artifacts of, for 
example, dispersive, diffusive or advective nature;  
they should also be robust and stable in the face of 
parameter changes and forcing variations.  For 
operational applications, speed of calculation is 
also an important factor.  Methods most suitable 
in one area, such as the deep ocean, may not be 
appropriate in coastal areas;  models ideal for the 
representation of some processes, say Rossby 
wave propagation, may fail miserably in some 
other regard.  Experimentation is a necessary and 
important aspect of model development.   
 
 At this stage of ocean modelling, it is 
essential to foster independent experimentation 
among different groups in different PICES 
countries;  it is equally important to facilitate 
frequent exchange of ideas and comparisons of 
models results between these various groups so 
that they may learn from each other and that 
independent work may contribute to progress for 
all.

5.0  MARGINAL SEAS 
 
 Three important semi-enclosed marginal 
seas surround the subarctic North Pacific:  the Sea 
of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan and the Bering Sea. 
These areas are the site of more extreme 
thermohaline forcing than the open Pacific.  
Runoff, cooling and ice formation in the marginal 
seas contribute to water mass modifications which 
affect the surface and intermediate water 
properties of the subarctic North Pacific.  
 
The Sea of Okhotsk 
 
 The oceanography of the Sea of Okhotsk 
has recently been extensively reviewed by Talley 
and Nagata (1995).  This sea has extensive 
shallow areas as well as deeper basins in the 
middle and the south (Fig. 23).  The circulation 
during the warm season consists of a cyclonic 
gyre, with more intense currents along the coasts 
and significant input from the Sea of Japan 
through Soya Strait. (Fig. 24).  There is also 
thought to be important inflow of water from the 
Pacific through the passes of the Kuril 
Archipelago.  Pacific Ocean waters circulating 
through the Sea of Okhotsk are cooled and diluted 
with fresh water.  Waters exiting the Sea at its 
southeastern end mix with Oyashio waters and are 
thought to be an important contributor to the 
formation of NPIW.   
 
 There have been few publications on 
models of the Okhotsk Sea;  Luchin (1993), as 
quoted in Talley and Nagata (1995), mentions 
only his own modelling efforts (Luchin, 1982), 
where he applied Sarkisyan's D1/18/ model 
(Sarkisyan, 1977) to calculate summer currents 
using available water density information and 
atmospheric pressure fields described by 
Timofeeva.  More recently, Kuzin et al. (1995) 
have reported on diagnostic and one-month 
prognostic calculations of the circulation in the 
Sea of Okhotsk.  
 
 The exchanges between the Pacific and 
the Sea of Okhotsk through the Kurile Islands 
occur in the vicinity of major anticyclonic eddies 
of great persistence (Zyryanov, 1974).  The 
origin, nature and role of these features remain 
poorly understood, and need to be clarified in 
order to understand the exchange between the Sea 
of Okhotsk and the Pacific.  The complex 
interactions suggested by Bobkov's (1993) 
interpretation of the circulation near the southern 
boundary of the Sea of Okhotsk (Fig. 25) present a 
significant challenge to modelers.  Improved 
numerical modelling will certainly prove to be an 
important tool to unravel the subtleties of the 
interactions of the Sea of Okhotsk with the Pacific.  
 
The Sea of Japan 
 
 The Sea of Japan is a deep basin, 
connected to the rest of the Pacific by shallow sills 
(Fig. 26).  Overviews of its oceanography and 
circulation have been presented by Ichiye (1984) 
and Takano (1991).  Overall circulation  (Fig. 
27) is driven by winds, runoff and temperature 
differences, and by inflow in the south through 
Tsushima Strait with outflow through Tsugaru and 
Soya Straits.  
 
  There have been extensive theoretical and 
numerical modelling studies of the Japan Sea 
(Kawabe, 1982;  Yoon, 1982a, b, c;  Sekine, 
1986, 1991;  Kang, 1988;  Seung and Kim, 1989, 
1993;  Seung, 1992; Yoon, 1995;  and Holloway 
et al., 1995).  Some recent simulations in the Sea 
of Japan (Hurlburt et al., 1995b) have 
demonstrated the sensitivity of the abyssal 
circulation to horizontal resolution and shown the 
importance of going to a very high resolution 
(1/32 °) to reproduce the separation latitude of the 
East Korea Warm Current.  The state of 
modelling in that area is well developed but still 
subject to the general limitations regarding 
physical processes and data support stated 
elsewhere in this report (cf. also Vasilyev and 
Makashin, 1992;  Kozlov et al., 1995).   
 
 As far as the circulation in the subarctic 
North Pacific is concerned, the Sea of Japan is 
important because it contributes water to the 
Pacific through Tsugaru Strait, south of Hokkaido, 
and through Soya Strait and along the north shore 
of Hokkaido, into the Kuroshio/Oyashio 
confluence region and the area of formation of the 
 19
North Pacific Intermediate Water (Vasilyev and 
Dudka, 1994).   
 
The Bering Sea 
 
 The Bering Sea includes a very wide 
shallow shelf as well as a deep basin in the south 
(Fig. 28).  Extensive ice formation during winter 
is a dominant feature of its surface layer.  Alaskan 
Stream waters flows into the Bering Sea through 
Aleutian passes in the east and participates in the 
dominant cyclonic circulation which exits 
southwards as the East Kamtchatka current (Fig. 
1).  There has been extensive international study 
of the Bering Sea (Arsenyev, 1967;  Takenouti 
and Ohtani, 1974;  Sayles et al., 1979;  Stabeno 
and Reed, 1994;  Verkhunov, 1995).  Recent 
modelling (Overland et al. 1994) efforts reproduce 
some of the features of this circulation (Fig. 29). 
 
 As seen in Fig. 1, the general surface 
circulation of the subarctic north Pacific includes 
flow through the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk 
gyres.  These two marginal seas thus participate 
in the general cyclonic circulation of the subpolar 
gyre and play an important role in meridional 
transport of surface waters and their properties. 
Contributions from the Bering Sea to the Oyashio 
and from flow having passed through the Sea of 
Okhotsk are important to the formation of the 
NPIW and thus to thermohaline forcing of the 
surface and intermediate circulations.  
 
 Overall, temperature and salinity 
distributions within the marginal seas and mass 
transport through them and out at their boundaries 
are not sufficiently well documented to provide 
reliable boundary conditions for ocean-scale 
models.  No satisfactory modelling of the 
subarctic North Pacific is possible without 
including these fluxes.  Because these basins are 
much smaller than the whole subarctic North 
Pacific, they may be easier to model with a degree 
of resolution sufficient to reproduce all relevant 
features and may be used as test areas for new 
developments.  
 
 20
6.0  DATA REQUIREMENTS 
 
 A broad observation, arising from our 
review of models of the subarctic North Pacific 
circulation, is that the quality of the models is 
generally similar to that of the observations in the 
area, or layer modeled.  For example, models of 
the upper layer, about which most is known, are 
better and more reliable than those of the deep 
ocean.  The quality and density of data available 
in an area determine the level of knowledge of that 
area and hence set the standards for modelling.  
As a general principle, one could then state that 
the best way to improve the quality of models is to 
improve the quality and quantity of oceanographic 
data.  Since data are much more expensive than 
model results, some careful thought has to be 
given to gathering those data which will lead to 
the greatest degree of model improvement.  
 
Bathymetry 
 
 The simplest area of data improvement, 
which may be done once for all, is in the 
description of bottom topography.  A precise 
specification of bottom topography is essential for 
accurate modelling of processes in shallow areas, 
especially at the junction of marginal seas with the 
deep ocean.  The importance of topographic 
accuracy is also felt strongly where the Kuroshio 
closely approaches the Japanese coast, before it 
flows over the Izu ridge.  In that region, 
baroclinic interactions with bottom slopes and 
other vorticity effects are particularly important 
and strongly affect the separation latitude and the 
subsequent fate of the Kuroshio and of its 
meanders. 
 
 ETOPO5 (NOAA, 1986), the industry-
standard bottom topography file for ocean 
modelling is thought to be unreliable in some areas 
below 200 m.  The Kurile Island region in 
particular is very poorly defined in ETOPO5 and 
there are some doubts about the accuracy of sill 
depths in that region.  Nearshore bathymetric 
information is usually available in national files, 
and the problem may be resolved by ensuring 
general access to all sources of bathymetric 
information within PICES partners.  
 
Atmospheric forcing 
 
   Accurate characterization of the wind field 
and of surface buoyancy flux constituents is 
crucial for reliable modelling of the subarctic 
north Pacific.  A comparison of results obtained 
by a high-resolution ocean model using 
respectively Hellerman-Rosenstein (climato-
logical data from ship observations) and ECMWF 
(output from ECMWF weather forecasting model 
with assimilation of observations) wind forcing is 
shown in Fig. 30.  There are significant 
differences in the path of the Kuroshio between 
the two simulations.  In their model of the 
Kuroshio/Oyashio confluence region mentioned 
above, Cherniawsky and Holloway (1991, 1993) 
and Cherniawsky et al. (1990) found a significant 
sensitivity of the Oyashio front to wind-stress and 
to buoyancy inputs.  These examples point out the 
need for the best local wind measurements and 
analysis as inputs to ocean models.  Long-term 
(many decades), high quality fields of winds and 
surface fluxes are needed to anchor studies of the 
sensitivity of ocean property and circulation 
variability to these fluxes.  A first step would be 
for PICES to initiate a review of the status of these 
fields. It is suspected that the biggest weakness is 
the surface freshwater fluxes [i.e. evaporation - 
precipi-tation].  The suggested review would be 
an important step in deciding "... the kinds of 
observations and other information needed to 
improve circulation models". 
 
 Re-analysis of atmospheric forcing 
functions is now underway at a number of 
agencies and will yield higher quality input to 
ocean models and to coupled ocean atmosphere 
models.  These efforts are designed to provide 
consistently-analyzed atmospheric fields through 
time using state-of-the art data assimilation 
techniques.  This will reduce the inconsistencies 
due to operational changes found in time-series 
analyses from operational products at weather 
forecast centres. 
 
 Accurate modelling of the surface 
circulation also depends critically on the 
availability of winds measured as closely as 
 21
possible to the sea-surface. In this respect, the 
availability of satellite scatterometer wind 
information is particularly important.  Support 
should be expressed for the continuation of 
programs, such as the Japanese ADEOS mission 
which carry out this function.  
 
Ocean properties 
 
 Oceanographic data are necessary for 
initialization, boundary conditions, assimilation 
and verification.  Information necessary to specify 
sea-surface fluxes is thought to be a weak point, 
especially in thermohaline models (precipitation 
and evaporation at sea).  More detailed 
climatologies than that of Levitus are necessary, 
especially in complicated regions. PICES should 
exert its influence on member states to increase the 
accessibility to local data sets collected by 
fisheries, defense and other agencies.  It is also 
thought to be important to continue to collect 
satellite data (altimetry, ocean color, 
scatterometry, infra-red radiation):  PICES should 
also push for continuation of "Earth  Observation" 
programs in member countries.  The Oyashio 
region east of the Kuriles is poorly sampled, 
especially in the winter [40-50 °N, 145-170 °E];  
more information is required in that area to 
understand water properties leading to 
intermediate water formation.  Finally, acoustic 
monitoring of ocean properties promises to yield 
large- scale information about ocean climate and 
perhaps ocean circulation.  PICES countries 
should keep an interest in such methods as a 
means of monitoring some aspects of the subarctic 
North Pacific. 
 
Currents 
 
 Sufficiently long-lasting direct current 
measurements, both at fixed moorings and by 
tracked drifters, are sorely lacking in many areas 
of the subarctic Northern Pacific.  Their absence 
makes critical comparison with model results 
difficult.  Long-lasting drifters, which can follow 
the flow at  controlled depths (or density levels), 
offer a particularly attractive means of comparing 
data and model results below the surface.  The 
results recently reported by Riser (1995) and Taira 
et al. (1995), using respectively RAFOS and 
SOFAR floats, in intermediate and deep waters of 
the western Pacific are an especially satisfying 
beginning in this respect and provide direct 
information over long periods of time on deep 
motions.  Satellite altimetry is already being used 
to infer geostrophic flows from sea-level slopes 
(e.g. Fox, 1993) and will develop into an 
operational tool to monitor surface currents and 
for data assimilation into prognostic models of 
ocean currents.  Every encouragement should be 
given by PICES to the deployment of drifters, 
especially at depth, and to satellite missions 
carrying altimeters.

7.0 APPLICATIONS OF MODELLING 
 
 Oceanographers wish to know about the 
ocean's circulation because they will then know 
where water goes, where it carries heat and 
materials away, how it affects ocean productivity, 
etc... Knowing the circulation may be a goal in 
itself, but it also has numerous practical 
consequences.  
 
Navigation 
 
 Knowledge of ocean currents is useful to 
plan the most effective shipping routes at sea: this 
was precisely the motivation for Benjamin 
Franklin to publish the earliest map of the Gulf 
Stream, off new England.  While modern 
shipping is less sensitive to ocean currents, there 
remains an area where ocean models can be 
extremely helpful to shipping.  This is in ice-
covered regions where winds and ocean currents 
move sea-ice around, alternately hindering or 
favouring navigation.  Coupled atmospheric-
ocean-ice models in the Sea of Okhotsk and the 
Bering Sea may still bring benefits in planning 
navigation in those areas.  
 
Ocean Pollution 
 
 The spread of noxious substances 
dissolved in or carried by ocean waters is a 
growing global concern.  Radioactive substances, 
dissolved gases and fine particulate matter might 
pose threats to ecosystems or unexpectedly 
catalyze geobiochemical reactions;  on the other 
hand, they may also provide information on 
mixing and advection in the oceans.  The interests 
of PICES members in maintaining high ocean 
productivity within a clean environment already 
clash with their own polluting industrial activities 
in near-shore areas;  they may soon also be causes 
of friction between member countries. A good 
understanding of ocean circulation and its 
variability is essential for the management of 
marine pollution.  Existing ocean models can only 
provide broad guidance on contamination levels 
and paths taken by pollutants. 
 
 Material floating at the surface of the 
ocean (flotsam) is a special kind of pollutant 
which often travels long distances to accumulate 
on distant shores.  Because of the visibility of 
flotsam, there has been wide concern about its fate 
at sea (Shaw and Day, 1994).  In the absence of 
predictive models capable of describing surface 
currents on a day-to-day basis over wide ocean 
areas, imaginative short cuts have been developed 
to satisfy immediate needs.  Wakata and Sugimori 
(1990) used average monthly ship-drift data to 
estimate the trajectories and average density 
distributions of floating debris in the North 
Pacific.  Kubota (1994) derived climatic monthly 
values of surface drift using COADS data (for 
calculating Stokes and Ekman drift) and climatic 
averages of water properties to estimate the 
monthly-mean geostrophic component of the 
surface flow.  The need for better temporal 
resolution of surface drift led Ingraham and 
Miyahara (1988, 1989) to develop the OSCURS 
(Ocean Surface CURrents Simulation) model 
which uses daily winds in combination with a 
climatological geostrophic current field to 
prescribe a surface drift velocity.  This model has 
been applied with some success to tracking 
drifting objects (Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham, 1992, 
1994) and to explore possible effects of ocean 
currents on salmon migration (Thomson et al., 
1992, 1994).  OSCURS of course cannot include 
mesoscale eddies.  Comparisons between 
OSCURS calculations and the drift rate of 
satellite-tracked WOCE drifters, drogued at 15 m, 
show considerable similarity, but also reveal that 
OSCURS speeds often exceed WOCE drifter 
speeds by 50% or more (Fig. 31).  This result 
reminds us of the presence of strong shears near 
the ocean surface and the sensitivity of surface 
drifter motion to direct wind action.  
 
Climate 
 
 Under climate change, we understand 
large-scale changes in ocean properties on time 
scales exceeding that of the ENSO phenomenon. 
There is evidence for interdecadal shifts in ocean 
properties (the 1976-88 shift, for example:  cf. 
Trenberth and Hurrell, 1995) in the subarctic 
North Pacific.  There is also evidence for longer 
term changes in near-surface ocean temperature 
 23
and salinity (Thomson and Tabata, 1989). Whether 
observed changes are of anthropogenic origin or 
part of long-term natural fluctuations is a question 
of pressing and continuing relevance. Recognizing 
long-term oceanic climate variability and 
understanding its causes requires global models of 
great reliability.  
 
 Secular trends in ocean properties are 
small, of the order of 0.1 °C/ decade or less 
(Thomson and Tabata, 1989) and could arise from 
a heat flux imbalance of the order of 1 W m
-2
.  
This is much smaller than the routine accuracy of 
surface flux measurements, although high-quality 
process experiments, such as the TOGA COARE 
experiment, have attained this level of accuracy 
over limited areas and short times.  This being the 
case, the interpretation of long time scale 
modelling exercises must be subject to great 
caution and it may be that ocean circulation 
models run over decadal time scales should be 
used to study the sensitivity of the ocean to small 
changes in surface fluxes;  they may also be 
useful for identifying causal patterns and linkages 
between modeled changes and subtle forcing 
modifications. 
 
 In addition to natural inter-decadal 
fluctuations one should also be concerned with 
changes associated with modified ocean 
conditions under global warming scenarios 
associated with  a doubling and a quadrupling of 
atmospheric CO
2
 levels.  Some studies (e.g. 
Manabe and Stouffer, 1994) indicate a very strong 
response in the North Atlantic, where the 
thermohaline circulation collapses, mostly due to 
the greatly increased excess of precipitation and 
runoff over evaporation following atmosphering 
warming.  The situation in the Pacific is more 
linear, with increasing atmospheric CO
2
  leading 
to increasing temperature (Weaver, 1993).  
Knutson and Manabe (1994) have performed a 
relevant simulation with a global coupled ocean-
atmosphere general circulation model with global 
warming induced by a 4 x CO
2
 atmosphere and a 
control 1 x CO
2
 atmosphere.  Despite a 5 °C 
warming in the equatorial Pacific and a 50% 
increase in time-mean atmospheric water vapour 
in the 4 x CO
2
 simulation, they found no 
intensification of the ENSO-like sea-surface 
temperature fluctuations, but rather a slight 
decrease in their magnitude.  Any coupled ocean-
atmosphere models should successfully represent 
ENSO in order to represent interdecadal variability 
in the North Pacific circulation.  This is another 
strong justification for extending North Pacific 
models to equatorial regions.   
 
Ocean productivity 
 
 There is growing interest in fisheries 
management in understanding large-scale 
variations in ocean productivity and in the 
carrying capacity of commercially important 
species, especially anadromous fish (e.g. Hinch et 
al., 1995;  Kuznetsov, 1995).  Modelling ocean 
productivity consists of imbedding food-web 
models within physical circulation and ocean 
property models.  There is already great interest 
in modelling various parts of the ecosystem (e.g. 
Frost, 1993;  SUPER, 1993;  Sugimoto and 
Hargreaves, 1993).  Exploration and proper 
representation of the links between wind and 
boundary mixing, Ekman pumping and 
productivity, especially their interannual 
variability, which are important physical factors 
on the biology, require high quality wind-driven 
models, and in turn high quality winds.  The re-
analysis of winds mentioned earlier is a welcome 
development in this respect.  
 
 Marginal seas and shelf areas are also 
areas of high biological productivity.  Variations 
in the production of commercial species of greatest 
interest often depend on phenomena and 
interactions occurring on scales well below those 
now resolved by ocean wide and regional models.  
A major challenge for fishery oceanographers will 
be to find a way to use the results of large scale 
models within the scope of more local interests.  
 
 Interannual variations in circulation and 
water mass patterns may have unexpected results 
on carrying capacity that will require coupled 
physical-biological models to quantify and test 
hypotheses regarding mechanisms of cause and 
effect.  For example, in the vicinity of Hawaii, in 
the central North Pacific subtropical gyre, the 
1991-92 ENSO event appeared to create a more 
stable surface layer. Karl et al. (1995) documented 
 24
a resulting increase in relative abundance of 
nitrogen-fixing microalgae such that the food-web 
shifted from nitrogen-limitation to phosphorus-
limitation, with accompanying changes in food-
web structure and trophic flows.  
 
CO
2
 exchange 
 
 At this point, we cannot reliably estimate 
the ocean-atmosphere CO
2
 transfer rate.  Both 
ecosystem and CO
2
 system studies will require 
explicit mixed layers embedded in Ocean General 
Circulation Models.  These models will have to 
represent adequately fluxes at the based of the 
mixed layer [the Large et al. (1994), kind of 
model].  Current GCM models of the CO
2
 system 
contain highly constrained biology (e.g. Maier-
Reimer, 1993), although Drange (1994) has 
developed a version of the Miami isopycnic model 
(Black et al., 1989) of the North Atlantic for the 
CO
2
 system that includes a 7-compartment 
ecosystem module.  No doubt similar attempts 
will be made in the subarctic North Pacific in the 
next few years.  
 
 Wallace (1995), in his discussion of 
monitoring carbon inventories emphasizes the 
need for further measurements and better models 
to understand the uptake of tracers (including 
CO
2
) and interpretation of tracer results.  
 
Fish migration and distribution 
 
 The distribution and migrations of fish 
populations are influenced by ocean properties.  It 
has long been a goal of fisheries oceanographers to 
discover reliable links between routinely measured 
ocean properties and the distribution of 
commercially exploited fish stocks.  More 
recently there has arisen a broad concern about the 
effects of climate change and its effect on the 
carrying capacity of the ocean (Beamish, 1995).  
 
 Once some relation has been established 
between fish habitat and ocean properties, 
modelling can help by keeping track of the 
location and extent of waters having these 
properties.  Forecasting of mesoscale variability 
may assist in directing fishing activity;  seasonal 
and interannual variability may affect stock 
assessment;  long-term climate variations may 
lead to significant changes in carrying capacity 
and in migration routes.  For example, in the 
northwest Pacific, a relationship between 
oceanographic conditions and saury fishing 
grounds has been found, suggesting that inter-
decadal oceanographic variations may lead to 
significant changes in migration routes (Yasuda 
and Watanabe, 1994;  Yasuda and Kitagawa, 
1995).  Welch et al. (1995) have recently 
discovered significant temperature limits to 
salmon habitat in the subarctic North Pacific. 
Prospects of global warming threaten to reduce the 
extent of this habitat.  
 
 Fish migration studies require not only 
ocean property distributions, but also currents.  In 
studying the effects of ocean currents on the 
homing migration of sockeye salmon to the Fraser 
River, Thomson et al. (1991, 1993) and Dat et al. 
(1995) used surface current vectors from the 
OSCURS model.  Francis and Hare (1994) used 
the same model in their bioenergetic studies.  
There is a clear need for better models of surface 
currents, and a comparison of the Hurlburt et al. 
(1996) model with WOCE drifter paths and 
OSCURS results would be in order. 
  
 Fisheries are an important economic 
activity of PICES countries and a better, more 
quantitative knowledge of the influence of ocean 
conditions on fish habitat and fish migrations is 
necessary to improve planning and management of 
fishing activities.  Existing circulation models are 
neither detailed enough nor reliable enough to 
follow fish habitat and predict migrations.  
 
Weather prediction 
 
 The influence of ocean temperatures on 
weather needs little discussion and is indeed the 
original source of interest of meteorological 
agencies in the oceans.  Better long-term weather 
prediction in North America relies in part on a 
better predictive knowledge of sea surface 
temperature in the North Pacific.  Refinement of 
Ocean-Atmosphere Coupled General Circulation 
Models is already a goal of Meteorological 
Agencies in member countries and it is important 
 25
for PICES to maintain close contact with these 
agencies as well as with ocean-oriented bodies.  
  
Ocean prediction 
 
 Prediction of ocean properties in real time, 
using methods similar to those of atmospheric 
weather prediction, is possible only with a good 
understanding of physics, powerful modelling 
tools and extensive data.  Dense sampling over a 
wide area is necessary to initiate a model and 
assimilate data into a prediction scheme. Coupling 
satellite altimetry with high-resolution models 
could allow predictive modelling of surface flows 
and their variability in regions of particular 
interest.  Preferred application would be to areas 
where rapid knowledge of the varying position of 
fronts, eddies or other features is thought to be 
relevant to economic activity, such as fishing, or to 
public safety, as in weather prediction.  Because 
of the limits of resolution (now at best +/- 2 cm) of 
the altimetry, the technique is currently applicable 
only in regions of sufficiently high eddy kinetic 
energy.  The development of ocean predicting 
systems has been reported by Robinson et al. 
(1989), Glen et al. (1991) and Miller et al. (1995).  
Fox et al. (1993) and Lai et al. (1994) have 
described operational applications in the Atlantic;  
Carnes et al. (1995) reported on efforts to apply 
similar methods to the North Pacific.  In all 
discussions of ocean prediction, one should recall 
earlier comments about ocean predictability, as 
summarized in Table 1.

8.0  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Conclusions 
 
 Our review has clearly shown that 
modelling of the circulation of the subarctic North 
Pacific is an area of intense scientific activity and 
that great progress has been made in recent years.  
This activity is taking place in the broader context 
of ocean modelling in general and often as a 
geographical component of pan-Pacific or even 
global models.  Progress has been driven by need 
for a better understanding and predictability of 
weather, climate, fisheries, navigation and 
environmental protection;  it has been facilitated 
by technological developments in numerical 
modelling techniques and computing technology. 
 
 A comparison of model results with 
available information on ocean currents and 
properties shows that, although models reproduce 
some of the main features of the circulation, many 
important features remain poorly modeled and 
indeed unexplained.  
 
 It is noteworthy that models have received 
the most attention and yield their best performance 
in areas where the observations are most detailed:  
Model results are also most detailed and closest to 
observations in the upper ocean, where data are 
most abundant.  Results at great depths are less 
reliable, if only because there are fewer 
observations to compare them to.  
 
 Confidence in model results thus 
continues to be established in relation to 
observations.  There are still too many difficulties 
in representing oceanic physics on coarsely 
discretized grids to believe model results simply 
on the basis of the physics which they contain;  
furthermore, there remain many contentious points 
about how well the physics are represented in 
existing models.  For example, we still don't 
know to what extent boundary layer versus interior 
mixing governs large scale dynamics.   
 
 Existing circulation models are still 
incapable of providing reliable explanations of 
variations in large-scale ocean productivity or in 
regional oceanographic features pertinent to 
fisheries.  There has nevertheless been significant 
progress made in high-resolution modelling of the 
North Pacific circulation, particularly in modelling 
high-latitude El Niño effects, which suggests that 
further progress is to be expected in that area.  
Because of current difficulties in modelling the 
mechanisms and rate of production of North 
Pacific Intermediate Water, and the lack of 
sufficient observations, it is not yet possible to 
assess the rate of ventilation of the subarctic North 
Pacific and its rate of uptake of carbon dioxide.  
The unreliability of deep circulation models 
remains an obstacle to connecting the subarctic 
North Pacific to global ocean models.  
 
 While predictive modelling of the 
response of the ocean to meteorological forcing 
remains limited by the predictability of 
atmospheric circulation, longer-term predic-
tability is possible in situations where a large 
component of variability is associated with 
internal dynamics, such as in the evolution of 
Kuroshio meanders, or of El Niño effects.  Ocean 
model predictive skills thus depend on the 
phenomena under consideration, as well as on 
model structure and the use of data assimilation 
techniques (Hurlburt, 1984).  Proposals for 
improvements in ocean modelling capability must 
take careful account of such considerations. 
Furthermore, given current developments in 
coupled ocean-atmosphere modelling, ocean 
predictive modelling on climatological time scales 
will soon be merged with ENSO models, North 
Pacific mid-to-high latitudes ocean and 
atmosphere system prediction and global warming 
models.  Ocean models will then be an internal 
component of climate models.   
 
 All the above problems are however 
characteristic of ocean modelling in general: 
similar difficulties are encountered in other 
oceans.  Some would argue that since 20 years of 
intense modelling efforts have still left a number 
of important deficiencies in models of the North 
Atlantic, a smaller ocean, it might be unwise in the 
short term to strive for full representation of 
subarctic North Pacific features in eddy-resolving 
models, and that the emphasis should focus on a 
 27
better understanding of the physics of specific 
processes (such as formation of the North Pacific 
Intermediate Water).  Others disagree with this 
opinion and would insist that detailed 
observational comparisons are as important in the 
Pacific as in the Atlantic. Recent high-resolution 
models of the North Pacific (Hurlburt et al., 1995) 
have been more successful at describing the 
separation position of the Kuroshio and its 
interaction with topography than similar attempts 
with the Gulf Stream.  However, computing 
facilities will remain for some time one of the 
limiting factors in the development of high-
resolution models of the Pacific Ocean circulation. 
 
 Numerical ocean modelling will continue 
to develop, driven by the needs of those who 
would apply its results as well as by the scientific 
ambition of modelers.  Academic and operational 
models will continue to be improved as physical 
and computational understanding is refined and 
the machinery's power increases.  What is of 
concern to this Working Group is what can be 
done by PICES to facilitate the improvement of 
circulation models in the subarctic North Pacific 
and to bring the greatest benefits to participating 
countries.  Our recommendations will address 
these issues.  
 
 In keeping with our observation that the 
best models are developed where the best data are 
available, our first set of recommendations 
addresses the continuing need for information 
about the ocean to stimulate model development 
and permit verification.  Fundamentally, the more 
we know about the ocean, especially about those 
aspects in which we are most interested, the better 
our models will become.  Ocean modelling is still, 
and will long remain, at a stage where model 
results cannot replace data.  One of the most 
effective means for PICES to assist in improving 
models of the circulation of the subarctic North 
Pacific is to recommend action to fill data gaps 
and to make data available to modelers of all 
participating countries.  
 
Recommendation 1. PICES should press for 
filling data gaps seen by the Working Group as 
impediments to model development in the 
following areas:  
1.1 -  ocean bathymetry, currently available in 
files such as ETOPO5, with 5-minute 
resolution, is inadequate for coastal models, 
marginal seas, and flow-topography 
interactions. General availability of geo-
referenced high resolution (1 km or better) 
bathymetry is required for reliable modelling 
in those circumstances.  PICES should 
mandate a small group with the responsibility 
of making this information available to its 
members.  
 
1.2 -  extensions of ocean property atlases to 
finer spatial and temporal resolution are 
desirable, especially in areas of active mixing 
(Kuroshio/Oyashio confluence) and strong air-
sea exchanges (Bering and Okhotsk Seas).  
PICES should create, or stimulate within one 
of its members, the creation of a group of 
people devoted to the formulation and 
accomplishment of that task.  
 
1.3 -  ocean-atmospheric exchanges are a 
dominant forcing of oceanic models;  high-
resolution, re-analyzed atmospheric heat flux, 
freshwater flux and wind stress fields are 
essential for modelling of upper layer 
properties and circulation.  PICES should 
initiate, or stimulate, a detailed review of the 
quality and availability of time-series of all 
meteorological forcing fields over the 
subarctic North Pacific as a step towards 
improving the reliability of models.  
 
1.4 -  high spatial and temporal resolution of 
ocean properties, especially sea-level height 
(through satellite altimetry), is essential for 
documenting the circulation and facilitating 
model verification. PICES should express 
strong support for national and international 
satellite missions for observation of the 
oceans.   
 
Recommendation 2. PICES should express 
support for the development of the Ocean 
Observing System and offer assistance in 
coordinating its implementation in the subarctic 
North Pacific. 
 
 28
Recommendation 3. Data are useful only when 
available.  PICES should encourage the 
development of avenues of rapid, informal as well 
as formal, data exchange between agencies, 
institutions and individual scientists in 
participating countries, so that collaboration may 
be enhanced and model development hastened. 
 
 A second set of recommendations aims at 
encouraging development of models for the 
benefit of PICES countries.  Although we have 
indicated a number of areas in which 
improvements are needed in physics and in 
computing, we do not attempt to be prescriptive of 
details:  progress will be accelerated by means of 
providing modelers with information, equipment 
and challenges. 
 
Recommendation 4. To encourage develop-
ment of modelling, PICES should sponsor or 
support interdisciplinary, international workshops 
concerned with modelling specific geographical 
areas or addressing specific fundamental issues. 
These workshops should be carefully focussed, 
identifying needs, state-of-the-art, challenges and 
suggestions for improvements.  
 
 Suggested geographical areas could be: 
the Kuroshio/Oyashio confluence; the Kuroshio 
extension; Bering Sea - Pacific Ocean exchange, 
etc.... Modelling topics could be: matching 
marginal sea to the deep ocean;  the deep and 
abyssal circulation;  data assimilation and its 
application to circulation models as well as to 
other, not exclusively physical, ocean properties. 
 
Recommendation 5. To enhance the utility of 
models to a broad community of ocean scientists 
and decision makers of countries with different 
languages and scripts, PICES should encourage 
the development of visualization methods 
applicable to large (the whole subarctic North 
Pacific domain) as well as small scale (e.g. 
Kuroshio path simulations) situations and capable 
of carrying impactful insight about all kinds of 
ocean phenomena.  A competition for the most 
successful visualization satisfying these criteria 
could be a feature of PICES meetings, with 
appropriate prizes.

Although the subarctic oceans play an important role in the earth's climate system as a region where 
strong air-sea interactions occur and active ventilation of the oceans takes place, the present state of 
modelling of the subarctic oceans is not satisfactory even with respect to the physics.  This is one of the 
most important unresolved questions for constructing an accurate climate forecasting system.  In view of 
the importance of modelling of the North Pacific Circulation for the global climate forecast, the Working 
Group will: 
 
- Review the status of present physical modelling efforts on the subarctic North Pacific 
circulation and identify the gaps and problem areas, 
- Identify the kinds of observations and other information needed to improve 
circulation models, 
 
- Identify what kinds of knowledge of the related physical processes and of local ocean 
dynamics (such as in marginal seas) are needed to improve the circulation models, 
and 
 
- Identify how the incompleteness of the present physical model of the subarctic North 
Pacific influences other modelling efforts such as the global climate, ecosystems, 
material transport, etc. 
 
A focus on physical aspects of modelling will be maintained.

Appendix 3. Working group activities 
 
 The working group was created at the PICES meeting in Seattle in October 1993. 
 
 Members of the working group were selected by their respective governments in early 1994. 
 
 The co-chairmen, LeBlond and Endoh, began electronic communication at that time, circulated 
ideas and suggestions and solicited input from members of the WG.  
 
 It was resolved to hold a meeting in Vancouver in June 1994. Following that meeting, 
participants, as well as other members of the working group, were sent a rough draft of the report, 
with requests for contributions at specific points. An interim report was compiled by the co-
chairmen and used as a basis for discussions at the PICES meeting in Nemuro. 
 
 After a period of reflection, work towards completion of a report was resumed through 
communication between the co-chairmen in the spring of 1995. A revised draft was circulated in 
July and comments requested from all Group members towards completion of the report. These 
comments were incorporated in the draft final report presented at the Qingdao meeting.  Final 
corrections were made to the manuscript in the fall of 1995 following input from the Qingdao 
meeting.
