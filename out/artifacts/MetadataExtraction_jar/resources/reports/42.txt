Executive Summary 
 
 
The Working Group on Iron Supply and its Impact on Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems in the North Pacific 
Ocean (WG 22) was established October 2007 under the direction of the Biological Oceanography Committee 
(BIO) and consisted of 20 members from all PICES member countries, including Co-Chairmen, Drs. 
Shigenobu Takeda (Japan) and Fei Chai (USA).  The purpose of the Working Group was to examine the role 
of iron biogeochemistry and its impact on biological productivity and marine ecosystems.  
 
WG 22 has completed the following four goals in its terms of reference:  
1. Compile and synthesize available iron biogeochemistry data in the North Pacific;  
2. Review the past and ongoing laboratory, field and modeling studies on iron biogeochemistry and its impact 
on biological productivity and marine ecosystems in the North Pacific Ocean;  
3  Determine the natural supplies of iron to the North Pacific, which include atmospheric dust transport and 
movement of iron-enriched waters, and examine linkages between iron supply and ecosystem responses;  
4. Identify gaps and issues related to experimental and modeling activities, encourage and plan national and 
international scientific programs on iron biogeochemistry and its impact on marine ecosystems in the North 
Pacific. 
 
A fifth term of reference “Elucidate the role of iron as a potential regulator of harmful algal bloom (HAB) in 
coastal ecosystems of the North Pacific” was not addressed as the Group determined that there was some 
overlap on this topic between WG 22 and the Section on Ecology of Harmful Algal Blooms in the North 
Pacific (S-HAB) which could either be covered by the latter or incorporated into the activity plans of FUTURE 
(Forecasting and Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems), the   
second integrative science program of PICES. 
 
Due to a lack of coordinated research projects among the PICES member countries, enthusiasm at times was 
less than optimal among members during the course of the Working Group’s lifespan, but WG 22 did make 
notable progress in advancing our understanding on natural iron supplies and their impact on biogeochemical 
processes in the North Pacific Ocean through discussions at its annual business meetings, a BIO/SOLAS-
sponsored workshop at PICES-2009 in Jeju, Korea, and BIO/SOLAS-sponsored topic session at PICES-2010 
in Portland, USA. 
 
The 2009 Workshop on “Natural supplies of iron to the North Pacific and linkages between iron supply and 
ecosystem responses” (see Appendix 4 for the 2009 annual activity report and accompanying workshop 
summary, with extended abstracts), hosted more than 30 participants. The presentations ranged from talks on 
iron measurements in the North Pacific and the iron modeling effort in the Fe-NEMURO model to field studies 
that related to iron sources, distribution, and iron impacts on phytoplankton dynamics in both the eastern and 
western subarctic Pacific. Modeling presentations summarized the latest developments in iron and 
biogeochemical modeling at regional and global scales.  
 
The 2010 Topic Session on “Understanding the role of iron in regulating biogeochemical cycles and 
ecosystem structures in the North Pacific Ocean” (see Appendix 4 for the 2010 annual activity report and 
accompanying session summary), attended by about 50 people, generated interesting discussions on 
presentations covering a wide range of topics including iron chemistry, sources, transport and distribution, iron

impacts on plankton dynamics and dimethylsulfide (DMS) production, the role of zooplankton in smoothing 
the geographical heterogeneity of primary productivity generated by iron availability and the potential of ocean 
fertilization to sequester carbon.  
 
Some of the presentations made at the workshop and topic session have resulted in a series of publications, and 
these papers are listed in Appendix 3.  These publications have greatly improved our understanding of iron 
supply and biogeochemical responses in the North Pacific, which was the focus of the WG 22.  In addition, as 
one of the Working Group’s terms of reference, Drs. Shigenobu Takeda and Mark Wells (member from USA) 
worked  together  to  compile  available  iron  measurements  in  the  North  Pacific  (see  http://www.pices.int/
members/working_groups/Disbanded_working_groups/products/WG22_dissolved_iron_dataset.pdf). 
 
At the last meeting of WG 22 in 2010, a new working group on “Sensitivity of the North Pacific to 
Atmospheric Iron Deposition in a Low pH Ocean” was proposed, with the main objective to determine how the 
predicted decrease in ocean pH will impact the response of the high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) 
ecosystems to atmospheric iron deposition in the North Pacific. Although this proposal was not approved at the 
2010 inter-sessional meeting of FUTURE in Seoul, Korea, it was recommended that “ecosystem responses to 
multiple stressors” be a topic for a new working group and that these stressors should include acidification, 
dust input, pH, and iron cycling.  
 
In the meantime, there are some potential linkages between WG 22 activities and FUTURE.  For example, data 
sets for iron and related parameters in the North Pacific can contribute to the improvement of marine 
ecosystem models that will be used for understanding biogeochemistry and climate forcing.  A number of the 
papers published by the WG 22 scientists can provide useful suggestions for some of the activities of 
FUTURE’s Advisory Panel on Climate, Oceanographic Variability and Ecosystems (AP-COVE) concerning 
the role of iron in regulating ecosystem responses to natural and anthropogenic forcing. 
 
In summary, WG 22 has accomplished most of its originally proposed objectives. Through Annual Meetings, 
we kept the iron community in all PICES member countries together on a regular basis. Our Working Group 
members actively exchanged ideas and discussed their ongoing research results, which led to several important 
publications.  We also consolidated some of available iron data for the North Pacific, and more data will be 
added to this data set as time goes on. We are confident that our short 3-year effort will provide a sound 
foundation for future iron-related research in the North Pacific Ocean.

Section 1  Introduction 
PICES Scientific Report No. 42   1 
 
 
 
1 Introduction
In the subarctic North Pacific Ocean, iron plays a central role in regulating phytoplankton productivity and 
pelagic ecosystem structure.  There are several processes that supply iron from land, shelf sediment and deep 
waters to the upper ocean, including atmospheric deposition of mineral aerosols and combustion substances, 
lateral transport of coastal iron-enriched waters by eddies and boundary currents, and deep vertical mixing 
during winter or strong tidal currents at narrow straits.   
 
There were three iron enrichment experiments conducted in the subarctic North Pacific Ocean to examine the 
role of iron on biological productivity and carbon flux.  SEEDS-I and SEEDS-II (Subarctic Pacific Iron 
Experiment for Ecosystem Dynamics Study) were carried out in the western subarctic Pacific in the summers 
of 2001 and 2004, respectively.  SERIES (Subarctic Ecosystem Response to Iron Enrichment Study) was 
performed in the eastern subarctic Pacific in the summer of 2002.  The PICES Advisory Panel on Iron 
Fertilization Experiment in the Subarctic Pacific Ocean (AP-IFEP; 1998–2007) coordinated international 
collaboration among the scientists involved in those experiments.  Having completed its terms of reference, 
and before being disbanded, AP-IFEP proposed the establishment of a new Working Group on Iron Supply 
and its Impact on Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems in the North Pacific Ocean (WG 22).  This Group was 
established in 2007 under the direction of the Biological Oceanography Committee (BIO) and was co-chaired 
by Drs. Shigenobu Takeda (Japan) and Fei Chai (USA).  The purpose of WG 22 was to examine the role of 
iron biogeochemistry and its impact on biological productivity and marine ecosystems.  This has been dealt 
with through the compilation of an extensive dissolved iron data set, including original references, for the 
subarctic North Pacific (Section 2), followed by an overview of iron biogeochemistry and its impact on 
biological productivity and marine ecosystems (Section 3), natural supplies of iron to the region (Section 4), 
modeling activities (Section 5), and recommendations for the future of iron biogeochemistry studies in PICES 
(Section 6).   WG 22 terms of reference, membership, recent publications on iron supplies and biogeochemical 
responses, and annual reports, including workshop and topic session summaries, can found in Appendices 1–4.

2 Dissolved Iron Data Set of the North Pacific
 
 
Dissolved iron data of the North Pacific collected by 
WG 22 are compiled in an Excel file (available at 
http://www.pices.int/members/working_groups/Disb
anded_working_groups/products/WG22_dissolved_i
ron_dataset.pdf) from 46 original papers listed 
below.  A map of the stations and vertical profiles of 
the compiled data are shown in Figures 1 and 2, 
respectively. The data set includes dates, cruise #, 
position (station, depth), dissolved iron concentrations 
(filter sizes ranging from 0.2–0.45 μm) and references. 
The database is an expansion of that compiled by 
Moore and Braucher (2008).  
 
 
All users of this data set are requested to 
include the original papers into the reference 
section of their articles.

3 Iron Biogeochemistry and its Impact on Biological Productivity 
and Marine Ecosystems in the North Pacific Ocean 
 
 
Three open-ocean iron-enrichment experiments 
conducted in the Western Subarctic Gyre (SEEDS-I, 
2001; SEEDS-II, 2004) and the Alaska Gyre 
(SERIES, 2002) have shown that iron availability 
exerts potential controls on phytoplankton growth, 
nutrient utilization, algal community composition, and 
the ecosystem structure in the subarctic North Pacific.  
In the natural ecosystem, atmospheric dust has been 
thought to be the most important source of iron, 
supporting annual biological production in the 
subarctic Pacific, especially in the western region 
(e.g., Duce and Tindale, 1991).  Although the iron 
supply from Asian dust events seems to have enough 
potential to stimulate phytoplankton productivity in 
the western subarctic North Pacific waters (Iwamoto 
et al., 2011), clear evidence from field observations is 
very limited (Young et al., 1991), suggesting a spatial 
and temporal mismatch of the dust inputs and 
biological activities.  On the other hand, iron supply 
by airborne volcanic ash into the Pacific Ocean is 
comparable to the mineral dust input (Olgun et al., 
2011) and basin-scale dispersions of volcanic ash have 
been shown to stimulate the primary production in 
nearly the whole area of the subarctic waters in 
summer (Hamme et al., 2010).  Satisfying the algae 
demands for both light and iron is a key for 
phytoplankton blooming in high nutrient low 
chlorophyll (HNLC) waters, and it is interesting to 
compare the range in fluctuations of iron requirements 
under saturating and limiting light conditions between 
pennate and centric diatoms to better understand the 
influence of iron and light co-limitation in the 
competition between them for growth within distinct 
phytoplankton communities in the Eastern and 
Western Subarctic Gyres.  The impact of increasing 
atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic soluble iron 
is another important topic for future study in the 
subarctic North Pacific (Krishnamurthy et al., 2009). 
 
Studies by Nishioka et al. (2007, 2011) indicate that 
iron re-suspended from the sediments of the 
continental shelf is another important source of iron 
for the Western Subarctic Gyre.  There is a relatively 
consistent and/or seasonal supply of iron through 
lateral transport from a marginal sea and continental 
margin as well as through vertical mixing during 
winter in the western (Oyashio) region.  On the other 
hand, a restrictive supply of iron by mesoscale 
eddies, tidal currents, Ekman transport, and 
southeastward advection via the Alaska Gyre may 
produce relatively severe iron limitations in the 
eastern North Pacific region (Johnson et al., 2005) 
although iron from the continental margin might 
stimulate a wintertime phytoplankton bloom (Lam et 
al., 2006).  It is possible that the sedimentary iron 
supply from the Sea of Okhotsk can be used to 
explain the difference in dissolved Fe distribution 
between the western and eastern subarctic Pacific 
(Nishioka et al., 2003).  Particulate Fe concentrations 
are also high in the water column of the western 
Pacific. The characteristics and behavior of 
particulate Fe can vary significantly from small 
colloidal inorganic mineral particles to large organic 
aggregates, which may include both living and dead 
components (Hurst and Bruland, 2007).  Therefore, 
bioavailability of particulate Fe cannot be generalized, 
and elucidation of the key processes that regulate the 
transformation during lateral transport is a big 
challenge for both biogeochemists and modellers 
(Lam et al., 2006; Moore and Braucher, 2008; 
Fiechter et al., 2009; Fiechter and Moore, 2009). 
 
Observed seasonality in dissolved Fe concentrations 
in the surface waters of the Oyashio region (Nishioka 
et al., 2011) indicates that, in addition to the 
traditional view of dust input, the iron transported by 
intermediate waters should be considered as an 
important source of iron for phytoplankton blooms in 
the Oyashio region and the Oyashio–Kuroshio 
transition zone.  Sedimentary iron flux would be one 
of the major processes causing the difference in iron 
distribution and biological production between the 
Iron Biogeochemistry Section 3 
8 PICES Scientific Report No. 42 
Western Subarctic Gyre and the Alaska Gyre. 
Phytoplankton blooms over the shallow continental 
shelf of the eastern Bering Sea may also be supported 
by sedimentary iron supply (Tyrrell et al., 2005). 
 
To understand biogeochemical iron cycles in the 
subarctic North Pacific, it is essential to consider 
long-distance sedimentary-iron transportation. 
Recent field and modeling studies suggest that 
organic ligands, such as humic substances, play an 
important role in determining the basin-scale 
variation of dissolved iron distribution (Misumi et 
al., 2013; Uchida et al., 2013) but the transformation 
between dissolved and particulate phases and their 
interaction with organic ligands is still uncertain. The 
presence of relatively high concentrations of excess 
free organic ligands in the surface water may indicate 
the formation of iron-complexing organic ligands by 
phytoplankton release, grazing processes and viral 
cell lysis.  Such processes could be more active in the 
western North Pacific where biological processes and 
cycling are working substantially more than in the 
eastern North Pacific (Selph et al., 2005).  On the 
other hand, severe iron-limited conditions in the 
eastern region may stimulate the bacterial production 
of siderophores. Consequently, having a high-affinity 
iron transport system to take up iron from the 
siderophore-iron complex, which is known to operate 
in some oceanic-centric diatoms, could be one of the 
strategies for survival. However, the community 
half-saturation constant for growth with respect to 
iron was found to be similar between the Western 
and Eastern Subarctic Gyres (Takeda, 2011).  In future 
work, we need to test the co-limitation of iron and 
other essential micronutrients such as zinc (Jakuba et 
al., 2012) and vitamin B
12
 (Koch et al., 2011). 
 
In spite of high iron levels in coastal Oyashio water 
(Nakayama et al., 2010), it is hypothesized that iron 
availability controls the growth of phytoplankton in 
some parts of the Oyashio region (Hattori-Saito et al., 
2010; Takeda, 2011).  However, there is no clear 
relationship between photosynthetic physiology of the 
phytoplankton assemblage dominated by micro-sized 
diatoms and dissolved iron concentrations during a 
spring bloom in the Oyashio region (Yoshie et al., 
2010; see Hattori-Saito et al., extended abstract, page 
42), suggesting that the changes in photosynthetic 
parameters are caused by the shift in dominant diatom 
species having different iron requirements and/or 
intracellular iron pools (Sugie et al., 2011). 
 
In the pelagic food web, top-down control may also 
have an influence on the response of biological 
productivity to iron supply.  The increases in large, 
long-setae, or heavily silicified diatoms during the 
high grazing pressure period in the SEEDS-II 
experiment have been attributed to anti-predation from 
copepods (Tsuda et al., 2009) and it strongly suggests 
that both moderate iron supply and active 
mesozooplankton grazing may lead the phytoplankton 
assemblage to be dominated by large centric diatoms 
in the Western Subarctic Gyre. In the Alaska Gyre, 
low Fe:C ratio and high iron usage efficiency would 
be advantageous for coccolithophorids and pennate 
diatoms to survive in consistently low iron conditions 
(Wells, 2003) with additional prominence for pennates 
that have an extensive iron-storage ability (Marchetti 
et al., 2009) for sporadic iron supply from the 
atmosphere or from continental shelf sediments.

4 Natural Supplies of Iron to the North Pacific 
 
 
In the last three decades, marine geochemists have 
made significant progress in the techniques for 
studying biogeochemistry of trace elements. The 
advances in the sampling protocols and analytical 
techniques provide unprecedented capability for 
measurement of a wide distribution of trace elements.  
Determining the distribution of iron in the ocean, 
including the processes involved in oceanic cycles, is 
important for understanding the biological production 
of the ocean and its impact on the biogeochemical 
cycle and climate (Boyd and Ellwood, 2010).  To date, 
we have understood that various iron sources occur in 
the North Pacific, such as atmospheric dust (e.g., Duce 
and Tindale, 1991), re-suspension of sediments on the 
shelf (e.g., Elrod et al., 2004), lateral transport of 
coastal iron-enriched waters by eddies and boundary 
currents (e.g., Lam et al., 2006), iron supply from 
below the surface by deep vertical mixing during 
winter or by strong tidal currents at narrow straits 
(Nishioka et al., 2011), and iron supply from 
volcanism (e.g., Duggen et al., 2007). 
 
Atmospheric dust has been considered to be the most 
important source of iron in the North Pacific. 
Previous studies indicate that there is a longitudinal 
dust gradient across this region.  The flux of dust 
containing iron over the western subarctic Pacific is 
an order of magnitude higher than that in the eastern 
side (e.g., Duce and Tindale, 1991; Mahowald et al., 
2005; Measures et al., 2005).  This is due to the 
closer proximity to the second largest dust source in 
the world, the Gobi desert, and this is believed to be 
the leading cause for the longitudinal differences in 
biological production between the western and the 
eastern subarctic Pacific (Harrison et al., 2004). 
Although the role of iron dust supply to biological 
production has not been quantitatively evaluated, a 
few studies have revealed a connection between the 
atmospheric iron dust supply and enhanced 
biological production.  Bishop et al. (2002) reported 
that high-frequency observations of upper ocean 
particulate organic carbon variability showed a near 
doubling of biomass in the mixed layer over a 2-
week period after the passage of a cloud of Gobi 
desert dust.  Hamme et al. (2010) found that volcanic 
ash deposition in August 2008 initiated one of the 
largest phytoplankton blooms observed in the 
subarctic North Pacific. Unusually widespread 
transport from a volcanic eruption in the Aleutian 
Islands, Alaska, deposited ash over much of the 
subarctic Northeast Pacific, followed by large 
increases in chlorophyll, observed by satellite 
imagery.  Surface ocean pCO
2
, pH, and fluorescence 
revealed that the bloom started a few days after the 
ashfall. The importance of glacial flour dust storms 
in the Gulf of Alaska (GoA) has also been suggested 
by Crusius et al. (2011). 
 
On the other hand, many previous studies have 
postulated that re-suspended particles from 
continental shelf sediments are a primary source of 
iron for phytoplankton in the coastal upwelling zone 
(Johnson et al., 1999; Bruland et al., 2001; Elrod et 
al., 2004; Bruland et al., 2005; Kudela et al., 2006; 
Cullen et al., 2009). Wu et al. (2009) also indicated 
that variations in surface water iron concentrations in 
the northern GoA from spring through summer 
appear to result from the changes in freshwater 
discharge and physical processes on the shelf.  In 
addition, the naturally occurring high-chlorophyll 
regions that develop at the boundaries of these iron-
limited HNLC waters and nitrate-poor, iron-rich 
coastal waters are reported in several studies. For 
instance, Aguilar-Islas et al. (2007) and Hurst et al. 
(2010) have examined the “green belt” that occurs at 
the shelf break in the southeastern Bering Sea, and 
they propose an “iron curtain” hypothesis.  Details of 
the iron supply mechanisms at the shelf break of the 
“green belt” by turbulent mixing processes has also 
been studied by Tanaka et al. (2012). 
 
Attention also has been drawn to long-distance 
horizontal transport of iron-rich coastal waters 
offshore (Harrison et al., 2004).  The re-suspended 
Natural Supplies of Iron   Section 4

particles from continental shelf sediments are 
included into bottom water and the iron-containing 
water can be moved over long distances by water 
transport systems. Eddy transport from the 
continental margin is an important process for 
supplying iron to the oceanic part of the GoA 
(Johnson et al., 2005; Rovegno et al., 2009; Lippiatt 
et al., 2010, 2011; Xiu et al., 2011).  Lippiatt et al. 
(2011) carried out a major field study to test the 
hypothesis that regions of high biomass observed in 
satellite imagery in the northern GoA in mid-summer 
are due to the high river and glacial melt runoff 
during this time of year into the Alaska Coastal 
Current (ACC), enriching the ACC with both 
dissolved and leachable particulate Fe, and the 
resultant mixing of this high iron coastal water with 
the HNLC waters of the adjacent GoA via mesoscale 
anti-cyclonic eddies. They examined the roles of 
Kenai Eddies, 100 to 200 km in diameter, in 
transporting dissolved and leachable particulate Fe 
from the shelf regions to offshore into the open GoA.  
They demonstrated the importance of eddies to the 
GoA in both the summer season and subsequent 
seasons. 
   
Other long-distance iron transport processes have 
reported.  The re-suspended sedimentary iron from 
the continental margin and the continental shelf of 
marginal seas is transported by boundary currents, 
and becomes an important source of iron into both 
the western and eastern sides of the subarctic Pacific.  
Lam et al. (2006) showed clearly that Ocean Station 
Papa (OSP) in the GoA received a lateral supply of 
particulate Fe from the continental margin off the 
Aleutian Islands in the winter, coincident with an 
observed biological bloom.  In the western subarctic 
Pacific, Nishioka et al. (2007) reported that 
sedimentary iron was discharged from a sub-polar 
marginal sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, into the western 
North Pacific by the intermediate layer water 
transport system, which is driven by sea ice 
formation processes.  There are additional reports 
that iron particles of volcanic origin from the 
Kuril/Kamchatka margins are sources to the western 
subarctic Pacific (Lam and Bishop, 2008).  Although 
the solubility of iron from volcanic particles is not 
perfectly understood yet, it is possible that a 
supplement of additional iron input from the 
Kuril/Kamchatka volcanic margin occurs and is 
transported by the water system to the Western 
Subarctic Gyre (Lam and Bishop, 2008).  These iron-
rich water transports play critical roles in supporting 
biological production, such as massive phytoplankton 
spring blooms in the Oyashio region in the western 
subarctic Pacific (Nishioka et al., 2011).  Another 
long-distance iron transport system was found in the 
New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCU) and the 
Equatorial Under Current (EUC) in the western 
equatorial Pacific.  The NGCU waters are enriched 
with iron and the iron is mobilized in a highly active 
western boundary current region and transported 
eastward in the lower EUC (Mackey et al., 2002; 
Slemons et al., 2010), supporting biological production 
in the eastern equatorial Pacific (Wells, 1999).  
  
These studies provide insight into the mechanisms of 
iron supply to the North Pacific and key 
biogeochemical pathways of reactive forms of iron 
that should be introduced in ecosystem models. 
These multiple iron sources and related physical 
processes should be considered for understanding 
biological production in the North Pacific.

Iron deficiency limits primary production in high-
nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions: the 
subarctic North Pacific (Martin and Fitzwater, 1988; 
Tsuda et al., 2003; Boyd et al., 2004), and indirectly 
controls the production in the nitrogen-limited 
subtropics by limiting N
2
 fixation (Michaels et al., 
1996; Falkowski, 1997; Kustka et al., 2003; Morel 
and Price, 2003; Mills et al., 2004; Moore and 
Doney, 2007). Thus, iron is a key element for 
understanding marine biogeochemistry and the 
marine ecosystem.  Therefore, it is important that the 
mechanisms of iron supply to the North Pacific and 
the key biogeochemical pathways of reactive forms 
of iron should be introduced into biogeochemical 
and/or ecosystem models.  
 
A growing amount of field data on dissolved iron 
concentrations is improving our understanding of 
oceanic iron distribution, sources and important 
physical processes of iron supply, and is guiding the 
development of iron cycle models.  Field data for the 
North Pacific was compiled by Johnson et al. (1997). 
(Further accumulation of field data has revealed 
inter-ocean gradients of dissolved iron concentrations 
(de Baar and de Jong, 2001; Gregg et al., 2003; 
Parekh et al., 2005; Moore and Braucher 2008)). 
Johnson’s data exhibited a nutrient-type vertical 
profile with concentrations in deep water roughly 
converging to 0.6 nM without significant inter-ocean 
differences. Based on these observations, they 
proposed an iron cycle model where complexation by 
strong iron-binding ligands reduces iron scavenging 
rates at concentrations less than a presumed ligand 
concentration of 0.6 nM.  From this concept, Archer 
and Johnson (2000) introduced explicit kinetics for 
iron and the binding ligands and incorporated it into 
a three-dimensional General Circulation Model 
(GCM); the results confirmed the importance of iron 
complexation.  Parekh et al. (2004) conducted box-
model experiments to examine a large parameter for 
investigating iron scavenging. Parekh et al. (2005) 
incorporated the iron model and optimized 
parameters into a GCM and successfully simulated 
differences in basin-scale iron concentrations in the 
World Ocean. 
 
Spatial distributions of external iron sources should 
be considered to represent a more realistic iron cycle 
in the ocean. Most early studies assumed that aeolian 
dust is the dominant iron source to the open ocean 
(Duce and Tindale, 1991), and early-stage models 
only included this source of iron for external sources 
(e.g., Fung et al., 2000) but continental margin 
sediments have recently been regarded as an 
important source of iron (Elrod et al., 2004). Both 
the aeolian and sedimentary sources are now 
incorporated into a number of numerical models 
(Moore et al., 2004; Moore and Braucher, 2008; 
Parekh et al., 2008). Sensitivity experiments either 
prescribing aeolian or sedimentary sources have 
suggested that sedimentary iron contributes to some 
open ocean regions, particularly in the North Pacific 
(Moore and Braucher, 2008).  
 
Numerous models have been established to represent 
the atmospheric iron supply (e.g., Luo et al., 2008; 
Mahowald et al., 2009), responses of iron enrichment 
experiment experiments (e.g., Fujii et al., 2005; 
Yoshie et al., 2005; Takeda et al., 2009; Denman et 
al., 2009), iron limitation in specific locations due to 
physical and chemical processes (Dutkiewicz et al., 
2009; Fiechter et al., 2009; Shigemitsu et al., 2012), 
iron transport by eddies and boundary currents (e.g., 
Lam et al., 2006; Xiu et al., 2011), iron speciation 
(colloidal, binding ligands (e.g., Parekh et al., 2008; 
Misumi et al., 2011), and iron supply to diazotrophs 
(e.g., Moore and Doney, 2007) in the North Pacific.  
 
Modelers have made significant progress in 
constructing ocean ecosystem and biogeochemical 
models for studying iron-related issues in the North 
Pacific. However, there are still gaps and issues 
related to experimental and modeling activities on 
iron cycle studies in the subarctic North Pacific. With

respect to atmospheric dust input to the surface 
ocean, one of the largest uncertainties entails the 
percentage of iron dissolution from different types of 
dust. Similarly, the extent of dissolution or biological 
availability of suspended particulate Fe, especially 
the continental source from rivers and re-suspended 
sediments, is a large uncertainty.  
 
In coastal areas with high concentrations of 
suspended terrigenous particles with iron coatings, 
the concentration of strong Fe(III)-binding organic 
ligands appears to control the dissolved Fe 
concentrations. The large excess of leachable 
particulate Fe acts as a capacitor or buffer to supply 
dissolved Fe to essentially titrate the strong Fe(III)-
binding organic ligands. Leachable particulate Fe is a 
far more important source of iron than has been 
realized. An important question is the residence time 
of particulate Fe in the relatively long-lived eddies. 
Location of the continental shelf in relation with 
water formation and current direction, especially in 
the mesopelagic layer, is an important factor for 
controlling sedimentary iron transportation in the 
subarctic Pacific. The model should include these 
processes with high resolution water circulation.  
 
The main form of iron, which is supplied from 
sedimentary sources, is in particulate form.  We need 
to know the spatial change of the particulate Fe bio-
availability which contributes to phytoplankton 
growth. We need more experiments, and more 
observations, for evaluating its bio-availability. 
Models should represent particulate Fe with 
changing bioavailability. In addition, modeling 
studies can be used to suggest the dominant 
processes to explain the upward iron transport from 
the intermediate water to the surface layer, e.g., tidal 
mixing, winter mixing, Ekman transport, etc. 
Chemical iron speciation and its distribution and 
cycle in the ocean are not well established owing to 
the analytical difficulty in measuring iron and its 
complex chemical nature in seawater.  The dynamics 
and sources of ligands in the ocean are still unclear. 
 
Large-scale iron ocean fertilization experiments have 
shown that iron dust can increase, albeit modestly, 
carbon sequestration, and can significantly affect the 
production and flux of dimethylsulfide (DMS) and 
other trace gases to the atmosphere (see reviews in 
Marine Ecology Progress Series, 2008, vol. 364, pp. 
213–309). In several of these experiments, the 
dynamics of carbon and DMS were tightly coupled 
to the early blooms of calicifying prymnesiophytes, 
which are highly sensitive to variations in pH. Thus, 
the predicted decrease in oceanic pH could affect 
their response to iron availability. This could 
significantly alter the impact of atmospheric iron 
deposition on the North Pacific ecosystems. This 
important issue should be addressed through onboard 
and in situ mesocosm experiments with a series of 
treatments, such as additions of dust, Fe, CO
2
, and 
Fe+CO
2
. The results from these experiments may 
encourage development of new ecosystem models 
which can assess the impact of iron deposition on 
primary production, and global climate in a high CO
2
 
world.

Section 6  Recommendations 
PICES Scientific Report No. 42   19 
 
 
 
6 Recommendations for the Future of Iron Biogeochemistry Studies 
within PICES
 
During its final meeting at PICES-2010 in Portland, 
USA, WG 22 discussed basic questions regarding the 
future of iron studies within PICES and agreed that 
the next phase of iron research in the North Pacific 
should cover:   
 ecosystem responses to changes in iron supply rates, 
amounts, and pathways, 
 dissolution or biological availability and residence 
time of suspended particulate Fe (from rivers, 
resuspended sediments, industrial combustion, and 
dust), 
 mechanisms controlling chemical speciation of iron 
in seawater and interaction of iron binding organic 
ligands with particulate Fe, 
 dynamics of iron binding organic ligands,  
 interactions of iron with other stressors such as pH, 
Cu, etc. 
 
For improving ecosystem models that include an iron 
cycle, more information is needed on: 
 iron removal and recycling, 
 iron sources,  
 physiology of co-limitation by iron and other 
parameters,  
 grazing on phytoplankton communities. 
 
The Working Group agreed that a better understanding 
of the iron supply is required before they can get 
ecosystems right, but they also need to get ecosystems 
right before they can get the iron concentration right. 
 
WG 22 recommended that PICES support:  
 integration of regional studies on iron biogeochemical 
cycles and its ecosystem impacts, 
 development of a North Pacific data base for iron 
and related parameters, 
 symposium/annual meeting sessions on the role of 
iron in regulating ecosystem responses to natural 
and anthropogenic forcing in the North Pacific,  
 model inter-comparisons activities. 
 
Term of reference 5 “Elucidate the role of iron as a 
potential regulator of harmful algal bloom (HAB) in 
coastal ecosystems of the North Pacific” was not 
fully taken up for discussion in WG 22. Therefore, it 
is suggested that this topic could be incorporated into 
the activity plans of the Section on Ecology of 
Harmful Algal Blooms in the North Pacific and/or 
FUTURE.  
 
Although WG 22’s proposal for a new working group 
on “Sensitivity of the North Pacific to Atmospheric Iron 
Deposition in a Low pH Ocean” (see proposal in the 
PICES-2010 report of WG 22, Appendix 4) was not 
accepted, some of its emerging issues were 
incorporated into the mandate of Working Group on 
Development of Ecosystem Indicators to Characterize 
Ecosystem Response to Multiple Stressors, selected by 
FUTURE’s Advisory Panel on Climate, Oceanographic 
Variability and Ecosystems, and established in June 
2011.

PICES Scientific Report No. 42  29 
AGENDA ITEM 5 
Review of national and international, past and ongoing activities on iron biogeochemistry 
 
National reports were given by Canada (Maurice Levasseur), China (Zhongyong Gao) and the U.S.A. (Mark L. 
Wells).  International reports and activities discussed at the meeting consisted of: 
 SCOR working group on synthesizing previous ocean iron fertilization data (Shigenobu Takeda), 
 Chinese SOLAS project and Asian Dust and Ocean EcoSystem (ADOES) (S. Tan), 
 IOC/WESTPAC (Mitsuo Uematsu), 
 Natural Fe Lagrangian Experiments (FeLEX) in the Southern Ocean (Meng Zhou), 
 London Convention on Ocean Iron Fertilization (Patricio Bernal and Fei Chai). 
 
Dr. Chai attended the London Convention Scientific Meeting on Iron Fertilization (May 19–23, 2008) where 
he provided a brief description of PICES and its function to the meeting Scientific Groups. He noted that: 
 
 PICES scientists had been involved in 6 out of 12 iron fertilization experiments during the past 15 years 
and that PICES has provided a platform to facilitate research activities on ocean iron fertilization (OIF) 
experiments in the North Pacific. The Advisory Panel on Iron Fertilization Experiment in the Subarctic 
Pacific Ocean was formed under the PICES, and had been responsible for coordinating three OIF 
experiments in the subarctic Pacific. The Advisory Panel not only helped to coordinate the field 
experiments, but also facilitated data synthesized and publications. 
 The newly established Working Group (WG 22), Iron Supply and its Impact on Biogeochemistry and 
Ecosystems in the North Pacific Ocean, co-chaired by Drs. Shigenobu Takeda (Japan) and Fei Chai 
(U.S.A.) will focus on two primary goals for the next three years: a) to promote better understanding 
of natural and anthropogenic iron supplies to the North Pacific and their impact on biogeochemistry 
and ecosystems; and b) to facilitate closer ties among various research communities (aerosol, physical 
oceanography, biology, chemistry and modeling) to better integrate new findings and to provide 
needed feedback to help coordinate research activities. 
 In regard to future OIF experiments, PICES can act as an independent scientific organization, and is 
willing to provide scientific expertise on future OIF experiments in the North Pacific Ocean, including 
independent evaluation and assessments. The review process will be for the interests of advancing 
scientific knowledge and potential impact on marine ecosystems in the North Pacific.

WG 22 Endnote 4 
Proposal for a 1-day workshop at PICES-2009 on 
“Natural supplies of iron to the North Pacific and linkages between iron supply and ecosystem responses” 
  
In the subarctic North Pacific Ocean, iron plays a central role in regulating phytoplankton productivity and 
pelagic ecosystem structure. There are several processes that supply iron from land, shelf sediment and deep 
waters to the upper ocean. The goal of this workshop is to examine key processes of these iron supply 
processes that includes atmospheric deposition of mineral Aerosols and combustion substances, lateral 
transport of coastal iron-enriched waters by eddies and boundary currents, and deep vertical mixing during 
winter or by strong tidal current at narrow strait. Such knowledge will be used to identify key biogeochemical 
pathway that should be introduced into the ecosystem models and to plan international scientific programs for 
better understandings of marine ecosystem responses to changing iron supplies in the North Pacific.

REPORT OF WORKING GROUP 22 ON  
IRON SUPPLY AND ITS IMPACT ON BIOGEOCHEMISTRY AND 
ECOSYSTEMS IN THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN 
 
 
 
The Working Group on Iron Supply and its Impact on Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems in the North Pacific 
Ocean (WG 22) held its second meeting on October 25, 2009 from 14:00 to 18:00 under the co-chairmanship 
of Drs. Fei Chai and Shigenobu Takeda who welcomed the participants and called the meeting to order. 
Members who attended the meeting are listed in WG 22 Endnote 1. 
 
Unfortunately, the Working Group lost one of its members, Prof. Xiuren Ning, from China, who died from an 
automobile accident in France. At the beginning of the meeting, members and observers held one minute of 
silence to pay tribute to Prof. Ning.  
 
Drs. Chai and Takeda reviewed its Terms of Reference, and reported on the progress and activities of the 
Working Group during the past year. Dr. Takeda talked about the SCOR working group on synthesizing ocean 
iron fertilization data and future modeling activities (WG 131 on The Legacy of in situ Iron Enrichment: Data 
Compilation and Modeling). Dr. Chai presented the U.S. position statement on large-scale iron fertilization 
experiments. Both Co-Chairmen reported on the London Convention Scientific Working Group and IOC ad 
hoc committee activities on ocean fertilization. Dr. Maurice Levasseur (member from Canada) was unable to 
attend the meeting, but prepared a document calling for international research collaboration on iron-dust 
deposition in the HNLC regions considering a pH decrease in the ocean. The Working Group reviewed the  
1-day workshop (W1) on “Natural supplies of iron to the North Pacific and linkages between iron supply and 
ecosystem responses” held October 25, 2009 and co-sponsored by BIO and SOLAS (see list of participants and 
workshop summary on page 34).  
 
A proposal for a Topic Session on “Understanding the role of iron in regulating biogeochemical cycles and 
ecosystem structures in the North Pacific Ocean” was put forth for PICES-2010 in Portland, U.S.A. (WG 22 
Endnote 2). The Topic Session will be co-sponsored by SOLAS. Convenors have been selected and invited 
speakers have been proposed, but not yet confirmed.   Travel support for two invited speakers is requested 
from PICES.

Proposal of a 1-day Topic Session on  
“Understanding the role of iron in regulating biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem structures  
in the North Pacific Ocean” at PICES-2010 
 
Iron plays a key role in regulating the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen, and pelagic ecosystem 
structures in the North Pacific Ocean, yet our understanding of these effects remains limited. External sources 
of iron, such as Asian dust, rivers, sediments, and volcanoes supply large amounts of iron to the North Pacific, 
while the physical processes of upwelling, meso-scale eddies, boundary currents, and tidal mixing transport 
deep waters with high iron concentration to the upper ocean. Biological uptake, zooplankton grazing, 
remineralization, and iron chemistry change the forms of iron and its distribution in the North Pacific Ocean. 
This session invites papers that address physical, biological and chemical processes controlling iron 
distribution and transformation, linkages between iron and ecosystem responses, and impacts on carbon and 
nitrogen cycles. We particularly invite papers that combine recent progress from field observations and 
modeling studies that relate iron cycling to ecosystem structures and carbon fluxes in the North Pacific Ocean.

Background 
 
In the subarctic North Pacific Ocean, iron plays a central role in regulating phytoplankton productivity and 
pelagic ecosystem structure. There are several processes that supply iron from land, shelf sediment and deep 
waters to pelagic ecosystem. The goal of this workshop was to examine the relative importance of these iron 
supply processes that includes atmospheric deposition of mineral aerosols and combustion substances, lateral 
transport of coastal iron-enriched waters by eddies and boundary currents, and deep vertical mixing during 
winter or by strong tidal current at narrow strait. Such knowledge will be used to identify key biogeochemical 
pathway that should be introduced into the ecosystem models and to plan international scientific programs for 
better understandings of marine ecosystem responses to changing iron supplies in the North Pacific.

 Summary of Presentations 
 
The workshop, sponsored by the BIO Committee and SOLAS, was the first workshop organized by the 
Working Group on Iron Supply and its Impact on Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems in the North Pacific Ocean 
(WG 22). The 1-day workshop was held on October 25, and consisted of two parts. The first part included a 
total of 9 oral presentations and one poster, and it lasted from 9:00 to 15:30 h. The second part was WG 22’s 
first business meeting, which was conducted from 16:00 to 18:00 h. The workshop had more than 30 
participants representing all PICES member countries. Six talks in the morning focused on the field studies 
that related to iron sources, distribution, and iron impacts on phytoplankton dynamics in both the eastern and 
western subarctic Pacific. Three modeling presentations summarized the latest development of iron and 
biogeochemical modeling at regional and global scales. 
 
Discussion following these talks focused on the gaps and issues related to experimental and modeling activities 
on iron biogeochemistry and its impact on ecosystem structures and carbon cycle. Here are some highlights of 
our discussion: 1) atmospheric dust input and Fe solubility are associated with different types of dusts, 
including volcanic Fe input; 2) the role of eddies and coastal currents are important in transporting Fe, 
especially sedimentary sources of different forms of Fe; 3) both dissolved Fe and leachable particulate Fe are 
important for understanding Fe biogeochemistry, but information on residence time of particulate Fe is 
missing; 4) model parameterizations need to be improved with iron supplies from various sources; Fe removal 
and recycling in models need to be better described; 5) more experimental data are needed regarding 
physiological response of phytoplankton groups to Fe, and community structure changes to Fe supplies. Most 
of the presenters submitted an extended abstract before the workshop, so their key findings and 
recommendations on iron biogeochemistry research are expected to be summarized in WG 22’s final report.

Extended Abstract 
 
Much of the subarctic North Pacific is an iron-limited, high-nutrient, lower-than-expected-chlorophyll  
(HNLC) regime.  My research group has been studying the naturally occurring high-chlorophyll regions that 
develop at the boundaries of these Fe-limited HNLC waters and nitrate-poor, Fe-rich coastal waters. For 
example, we have examined the “green belt” that occurs at the shelf break in the southeastern Bering Sea 
(Aguilar-Islas et al., 2007) and the “iron curtain” hypothesis.  In the summer of 2007 we carried out a major 
field study to test the hypothesis that regions of high biomass observed in satellite imagery in the northern Gulf 
of Alaska (GoA) in mid-summer are the result of the high river and glacial melt runoff during this time of year 
into the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC) enriching the ACC with both dissolved and leachable particulate iron, 
and the resultant mixing of this high iron coastal water with the HNLC waters of the adjacent GoA via 
mesoscale anti-cyclonic eddies.  We examined the roles of Sitka and Kenai Eddies, 100 to 200 km in diameter,  
in transporting dissolved and leachable particulate Fe from the shelf regions offshore into the open Gulf of 
Alaska. Using a series of surface water transects and vertical profiles within and outside of eddies, we 
demonstrate the importance of eddies to the GoA region in both the current summer season and subsequent 
seasons.  These studies provide insight into mechanisms of iron supply to this region and key biogeochemical 
pathways of reactive forms of iron that should be introduced in ecosystem models.  
 
What are the gaps and issues related to experimental and modeling activities on an iron cycle study in the 
subarctic North Pacific? 
 
 With respect to the atmospheric dust input to the surface ocean, one of the largest uncertainties entails 
the % of Fe dissolution from types of dust. 
Appendix 4 WG 22 Annual Reports and Topic Session/Workshop Summaries  
PICES Scientific Report No. 42  37 
 Similarly, the extent of dissolution or biological availability of suspended particulate Fe, especially the 
continental source from rivers and re-suspended sediments, is a large uncertainty. 
 In coastal areas with high concentrations of suspended terrigenous particles with iron coatings, the 
concentration of strong Fe(III)-binding organic ligands appears to control the dissolved Fe concentrations. 
 The large excess of leachable particulate Fe acts as a capacitor or buffer to supply dissolved Fe to 
essentially titrate the strong Fe(III)-binding organic ligands. 
 Leachable particulate Fe is a far more important source of iron than has been realized. An important 
question is the residence time of particulate Fe in the relatively long lived eddies.

Extended Abstract 
 
Atmospheric dust has been thought to be the most important source of iron (Fe) supporting annual biological 
production in the Western Subarctic Pacific (WSP) (e.g., Duce and Tindale, 1991).  Our recent study clearly 
indicates that there is another important source of Fe for the WSP (Nishioka et al., 2007, 2011).  We conducted 
direct observations in the Sea of Okhotsk and found that Fe was re-suspended from the sediments of the north-
western continental shelf area.  The re-suspended Fe was included into dense shelf water (DSW), which was 
produced by sea-ice formation at the north-western shelf, then transported to the Kuril basin by the Okhotsk 
Sea Intermediate Water (OSIW).  The Fe-rich OSIW influenced the surrounding waters around the Kuril Strait, 
so that the Fe was re-distributed to a wide range of water density in the water column (from surface to deep 
water) due to the strong diapycnal mixing at the strait.  Chemical properties of the mixed water had an 
influence on the North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW).  These results clearly indicated that re-suspended 
sedimentary Fe is transported by ventilation processes, which are driven by sea-ice formation in the Sea of 
Okhotsk, and which distribute the Fe to a wide area of the intermediate layer in the WSP (Nishioka et al., 
2007).   
 
The Fe supply process, i.e., the sedimentary Fe supply from the Sea of Okhotsk, can be used to explain the 
difference in Fe distribution between the western and eastern subarctic Pacific (Nishioka et al., 2003).  Vertical 
measurements of Fe in the WSP indicated that increased gradients in dissolved Fe concentrations with depth 
from subsurface to intermediate water (NPIW) were greater in the WSP relative to those of Station Papa in the 
eastern subarctic Pacific (ESP).  Furthermore, particulate Fe concentrations are extremely high in the water 
column of the western region.  We also found that extremely high total Fe concentrations in the surface in the 
WSP occurred only in subarctic water masses north of the subarctic front (SF), and that this feature was clearly 
separated by the SF boundary (Nishioka et al., 2007).  Additionally, time series of Fe observations clearly 
show that there was temporal variability in dissolved Fe and total Fe concentrations in the WSP.  A higher 
temporal variability was observed to be stronger in the upstream of the Oyashio flow than at the oceanic 
station in the downstream of the Oyashio flow and in the ESP.  From the spatial and temporal Fe distributions, 
we determined that the high Fe input, mainly in the particulate phase, occurs north of the SF and upstream of 
the Oyashio region, and the Fe is subsequently distributed to the cold subarctic water in the WSP area.  These 
time-series and spatial data also indicate that some fractions of the Fe in particulate and colloidal matters were 
lost from the water column during the water transportation.  The results are consistent with our studies that the 
Fe-rich water is transported from the Sea of Okhotsk to the WSP. Therefore, the presence of Fe in the WSP 
cannot be solely explained by aeolian dust supplies over the study area (Nishioka et al., 2007). 
 
Furthermore, we observed a clear seasonality in dissolved Fe concentrations in the surface waters of the 
Oyashio region (Nishioka et al., 2011).  The Fe-rich intermediate water, also beneath the surface in the 
Oyashio region, influence the high concentrations of dissolved Fe in the surface layer in winter by seasonal 
mixing processes.  The surface waters are significantly influenced by high Fe concentrations in the 
intermediate waters through diffusion and winter mixing.  Therefore, in addition to the traditional view of dust

input, the Fe transported by intermediate waters should be considered as an important source of Fe for 
phytoplankton blooms in the Oyashio region and the Oyashio-Kuroshio transition zone. 
 
Similar sedimentary Fe supply processes have already been reported in the Gulf of Alaska.  Previously, Martin 
et al. (1989) reported on a North-South vertical section profile in the Gulf of Alaska, and indicated that 
enhanced Fe input occurred along the Alaska continental margin.  Takata et al. (2006) also indicated that high 
particulate Fe levels in intermediate to deep waters observed at 50°N, 165°E may be due to the input of Fe 
from the Alaskan continental margin to the Alaskan Stream.  Our previously observed Line P data also indicate 
the influence of the continental margin along Line P (Nishioka et al., 2001).  These results are all consistent 
with numerical modeling studies and water current structures in the Gulf of Alaska (Lam et al., 2006).   
 
The continental shelf is increasingly recognized as an important source of Fe in the many regions in the 
subarctic Pacific and its marginal sea (e.g., Johnson et al., 2005; Hurst and Bruland, 2007; Aguilar-islas et al., 
2007; Nishioka et al., 2007).  Location of the continental shelf in relation to water formation and current 
direction, especially in the mesopelagic layer, is an important factor for controlling the long-distance transport 
of sedimentary Fe into the subarctic Pacific.  Therefore, in addition to the traditional view of dust input, the 
sedimentary Fe sources and Fe transport by the water current system, especially in the intermediate layer, 
should be considered as an important source of Fe for biological production in the subarctic Pacific.  
Quantitative evaluation of these Fe sources, with an upward transport system, can contribute to a better 
understanding of the mechanisms influencing biological production and Fe biogeochemical cycles in the 
subarctic Pacific.  
 
Summary 
 Sedimentary Fe sources are important to understand Fe biogeochemistry in the subarctic Pacific. 
 These sources of Fe can explain the differences in Fe distribution and biological production between the 
WSP and the Station Papa. 
 Location of the continental shelf in relation to water formation and current direction, especially in 
mesopelagic layer, is an important factor for controlling long-distance sedimentary Fe transportation in the 
subarctic Pacific. 
 Considering this source of Fe with upward transport processes is essential in our understanding of 
biological production and biogeochemical cycles in the WSP and ESP. 
 
1) What are the gaps and issues related to experimental and modeling activities? 
 Location of continental shelf with water formation and current direction, especially in the mesopelagic 
layer, is an important factor in controlling sedimentary Fe transportation in the subarctic Pacific. The 
model should include these processes with high resolution water circulation. 
 The main form of Fe, which is supplied from sedimentary sources, is in particulate form.  We need to 
know the spatial change of the particulate Fe bio-availability which contributes to phytoplankton 
growth. (We need more experiments, and more observations, for evaluating its bio-availability.  
Models should represent particulate Fe with changing bio-availability). 
2) What are the processes that can explain the upward Fe transport from the intermediate water to the surface 
layer (tidal mixing, winter mixing, Ekman transport, etc.)?  
 Modeling studies can suggest some processes.  
3) What should be suggested for international research programs focusing on Fe biogeochemistry? 
4) Is there any other sedimentary Fe source area and transport system to the open ocean?  
 We need other process studies.

The constraint of carbon export by iron supply to the high nitrate, low chlorophyll (HNLC) subarctic Pacific 
likely has contributed to past global climate change.  Each year, mesoscale (~100 km diameter) eddies form off 
the Canadian and Alaskan coasts and transport coastal waters to the open ocean.  We studied the distribution of 
dissolved (<0.45 µm) and total iron in Canadian coastal shelf waters, in a 3 month old eddy off the Queen 
Charlotte Islands (Haida Gwaii), and in surrounding oceanic waters.  Our measurements show that iron levels 
were near oceanic levels in eddy surface waters while concentrations of iron below 80 m were ten-fold higher 
than outside the eddy. A simple one-dimensional advective/diffusion model’s estimates indicate that iron 
infusion to surface waters in this single eddy roughly matches the total annual dissolvable aerosol iron inputs 
to the entire eastern subarctic Pacific. We are analyzing the potential impact of eddies on iron transport in more 
detail using the Pacific Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS) model, utilizing the modeled vertical and 
horizontal velocities with our limited iron measurements.  These estimates of vertical and horizontal iron 
fluxes will help better ascertain whether eddy transport mechanisms can represent a major source of Fe to this 
HNLC region. However, in contrast to aerosol inputs that persist or increase during periods of glaciation, the 
mechanisms driving eddy formation would be greatly diminished or absent during glacial low sea level stands. 
The reduction of these mechanisms would in turn reduce iron transport to the eastern subarctic Pacific and 
provide a potential negative feedback mechanism affecting global climate.

The spring phytoplankton bloom is a routine event in the Oyashio region of the western subarctic Pacific. In 
addition to the ample supply of macro-nutrients to the euphotic zone by winter mixing, the high concentration 
of iron enables diatoms to utilize nitrate and that induces spring blooms. The supply of iron makes the Oyashio 
region different from the HNLC subarctic Pacific. The timing and magnitude of spring phytoplankton blooms 
are spatially heterogeneous. Satellite remote sensing clearly represents the variability in chlorophyll 
concentration, and the variations of environmental factors associated with the chlorophyll concentration are 
also detected by the monitoring study along the A-line across the Oyashio region. However, the time resolution 
(monthly to bimonthly) and the limited observational parameters in the A-line monitoring programme prevent 
further understanding of the factors controlling the phytoplankton dynamics in the Oyashio region. In order to 
overcome such limitations, we carried out repeated mapping observations in the Oyashio region in 2008 in the 
BLOSSOM (BLOoming plankton Succession Study in the Oyashio Marine ecosystem) project. Finer temporal 
resolution and more observational parameters than those obtained in the A-line monitoring revealed that light 
and/or iron availabilities, which were mainly determined by physical properties, would affect the spatial 
heterogeneity of the spring bloom dynamics in the Oyashio region.

We present evidence of a widespread bloom in the Subarctic Pacific in August-September 2008, which may 
have been caused by volcanic ash input. Satellite-derived surface chlorophyll and brightness from MODIS 
showed the highest average values seen in this region since 1997 and showed that the phenomenon was 
widespread over the entire Eastern Subarctic Pacific.  Two cruises to Station P (50
o
N 145
o
W) in late August 
confirmed unusually high net community production (from O
2
/Ar measurements) and gross production (from 
short-term 
14
C incubations).  Nitrate and silicate concentrations were lower than normally observed in this 
HNLC region.  Seawater pCO
2
 and pH measured on a mooring at Station P demonstrate drawdowns in DIC 
and alkalinity beginning on August 13.  Mesozooplankton biomass, from continuous plankton recorder

surveys, was unusually high in August 2008.  The timing of the beginning of this bloom event matches the 
unusually broad dispersal of volcanic ash from the eruption of Kasatochi in the Aleutian Islands August 7-8.  
Evidence from satellite altimetry and derived currents as well as the widespread nature of the bloom argues 
against mesoscale eddies as a cause. Although mixed layers were deeper in this region during winter of 2008, 
normal stratification was established by mid-June and the summer was not significantly cloudier than normal.  
QuikSCAT winds for the region show that August 2008 was only somewhat winder than average, suggesting 
that enhanced vertical mixing was not a primary driver.  A large-scale iron fertilization of the region by 
volcanic ash remains the principal hypothesis for this event.

Extended Abstract 
 
It is hypothesized that Fe availability controls the growth of phytoplankton significantly in the Oyashio region 
during spring (Hattori-Saito et al., 2010). We examined Fe stress in micro-sized (20–200 µm) diatoms at a 
station in the Oyashio region during the spring bloom period from 6 April to 1 May in 2007, by immunological 
ferredoxin/flavodoxin assays and measuring the maximum photochemical quantum efficiency of PSII (F
v
/F
m
). 
The abundance and species composition of the diatoms were also examined concurrently with the 
hydrographic conditions including dissolved Fe (D-Fe) and macronutrient concentrations. Chlorophyll a 
concentrations at 5 m depth were consistently high (2–29 mg m
–3
), indicating that phytoplankton had bloomed 
throughout the cruise (Isada et al., 2010). According to the scanning electron microscopic analyses of the 
diatoms collected from 5 m depth, chain-forming centric diatoms dominated the phytoplankton community 
throughout the cruise. Interestingly, the dominant diatoms changed from Thalassiosira and Chaetoceros 
species to Chaetoceros radicans from 25 April. Only flavodoxin, an in situ diagnostic marker for Fe 
deficiency, in the micro-sized diatoms was detected throughout the cruise. This result indicates micro-sized 
diatoms were stressed by Fe availability. Dissolved Fe concentrations ranged between 0.17–0.53 nM 
(Nakayama et al., 2010). Comparing the abundance of the flavodoxin to F
v
/F
m
, higher abundance of 
flavodoxin were detected between 18 and 20 April, when the F
v
/F
m
 values were relatively low, indicating that 
the diatoms suffered low iron availability in their cells. Thereafter, flavodoxin levels were decreased with the 
increment of F
v
/F
m
, suggesting that diatoms might be somewhat released from iron stress. However, no 
significant relationships between flavodoxin abundance and dissolved Fe concentrations or F
v
/F
m
 were found 
during the observation. Despite the dramatically change of F
v
/F
m 
and flavodoxin abundance during the survey, 
macronutrients were replete and dissolved iron levels were relatively stable. Our results indicated that changes 
in photosynthetic physiology of the micro-sized diatoms were possibly caused by the difference in iron 
requirements among the diatom species.

Extended Abstract 
 
Introduction 
We intend to model the iron circulation in the western subarctic gyre in the Pacific in the near future. In order 
to model it, three steps are needed: constructing the ocean model, constructing the iron model, and combining 
the two models. In this study, we have constructed an ocean model as the first step for the iron modeling. 
  
The Sea of Okhotsk is considered to be a main source region of iron to the western subarctic gyre in the Pacific 
(Nishioka et al., 2007). Within the Sea of Okhotsk, iron is transported in the intermediate layer from the 
northwestern shelf along Sakhalin to the Pacific. Therefore, an ocean model that can reasonably represent 
circulations in the intermediate layer in the Sea of Okhotsk is essential for the iron modeling in the 
northwestern North Pacific area.  
  
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are inert gasses and are distributed only by advection and diffusion after they are 
taken into the sea at the sea surface from the atmosphere. Accordingly, models that can represent CFC 
distributions reasonably well may be regarded as models that can represent current fields in the intermediate 
and deep layers reasonably well.  
  
Keeping these things in mind, we have performed a simulation and two numerical experiments of CFCs. 
 
Model 
The model we use is Center for Climate System Research Ocean Component Model ver. 3.4 coupled with a 
sea ice model (Iced-COCO).  The model domain spans the northwestern North Pacific, from 136°E to 180.5°E 
and 39°N to 63.5°N.  The horizontal resolution is 0.5°.  The model is driven by daily climatology atmospheric 
data at the sea surface.  At the lateral boundaries and grids deeper than 2000 m, temperature and salinity are 
restored to the WOA01.  This model does not include tidal effects; diapycnal mixing by tides along the Kuril 
Islands is parameterized with large vertical diffusivity. CFC experiments are performed according to OCMIP-2 
protocol (Dutay et al., 2002).  At the lateral boundaries, CFCs are restored to 0.

Results 
Compared with the observation by Yamamoto-Kawai et al. (2004), the model represents the observed features 
in CFC-12 distribution reasonably well (we have simulated CFC-11 and CFC-12, but in the presentation we 
show only the results of CFC-12). The CFC-12 concentration in the intermediate layer is higher in the Sea of 
Okhotsk than in the Pacific, which implies that the source region is the Sea of Okhotsk. On the 26.8 σ
θ
 surface, 
the concentration is highest around the northern and northwestern shelf. On the 27.4 σ
θ
 surface, it is highest 
around the Kuril Islands. On the vertical section along 55.5°N, which passes through the northwestern shelf, a 
characteristic distribution is represented. While the CFC-12 concentration is high throughout the water column 
around the shelf, high concentration is limited within the winter mixed layer in the eastern part. These suggest 
that brine rejection and tidal mixing (diapycnal mixing by tides) play an important role to transport CFC-12 
into the intermediate and deep layers. 
  
To clarify the effects of tidal mixing along the Kuril Islands and brine rejection on the distribution of CFCs, 
two experiments are carried out where one of the two processes is not included. The experiment without tidal 
mixing along the Kuril Islands is referred to as the NOtide, and that without brine rejection is referred to as the 
NObrine. The simulation, which includes both the tidal mixing and brine rejection, is referred to the standard 
experiment. 
 
We show the difference in the CFC-12 concentration between the standard and each experiment (the standard 
minus each experiment) on three vertical sections:  along 55.5°N, along 50°N, which is located at the southern 
area of the Sea of Okhotsk, and along 151°E, which passes through Bussol’ Strait. In the northwestern shelf on 
the section of 55.5°N, the difference between the standard and the NOtide is small, and the difference between 
the standard and the NObrine is large, which illustrates that brine rejection is important and tidal mixing is not 
very important on the northwestern shelf. On the other hand, in the eastern part on the section, the CFC-12 
concentration is lower in both experiments than in the standard, but different from the standard in that the 
NOtide is larger and more homogeneous than the NObrine. On the section of 50°N, while the difference 
between the standard and the NOtide is large below a depth of about 100 m independent of longitude, 
prominent difference between the standard and the NObrine is only along the Sakhalin in depths of a few 
hundreds meters, which corresponds to the path of Dense Shelf Water (DSW). On the section of 151°E, the 
difference is distributed similarly. The difference between the standard and the NOtide is large below a depth 
of about 100 m independent of latitude, and the difference between the standard and the NObrine is prominent 
only in depths of a few hundreds meters around the Kuril Basin, which corresponds to the path of DSW. The 
differences on the three vertical sections illustrate that tidal mixing along the Kuril Basin plays a great 
influence in the distribution of CFCs below the winter mixed layer over the entire Sea of Okhotsk while it is 
only along the path of DSW that brine rejection greatly influences the distribution of CFCs. 
  
CFC cumulative flux is a time-integrated CFC flux at the surface during the simulation period, and it shows 
where CFCs are taken into the sea. In the simulation, the most prominent uptake of CFCs occurs around the 
Kuril Islands. Another prominent uptake occurs around the northwestern shelf. Those two prominent uptakes 
disappear in the experiments without tidal mixing along the Kuril Islands and brine rejection, respectively. 
Therefore uptake in those areas is due to brine rejection and tidal mixing, respectively. Those two processes 
make temperature and CFCs concentration low at the sea surface through convection or mixing. The lower 
temperature and CFCs concentration are, the more CFCs are absorbed in the sea. Therefore, the uptake of 
CFCs in these two areas is large. While tidal mixing exists throughout the year, brine is rejected only in winter. 
Hence, the uptake in the northwestern shelf is not as large as around the Kuril Islands. 
 
Concluding remarks 
The influence of tidal mixing along the Kuril Islands is very large on the distribution of CFCs over the entire 
Sea of Okhotsk. On the other hand, influence of brine rejection is large only in a limited area. However, in 
view of iron supply from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Pacific, brine rejection is, of course, important because the 
influence of brine rejection is large along the path of DSW, and iron is transported with DSW.  In this study, 
we have not discussed CFCs distribution in the Pacific since the model boundaries exert great influence there. 
Tidal mixing is expected to exert great influence on the distribution in the Pacific; it redistributes vertically the 
CFCs when they pass through the Kuril Straits.

Supplies of essential micro-nutrient iron to the upper ocean largely determine regional differences in biological 
production in the North Pacific Ocean.  The original NEMURO model developed by the PICES/GLOBEC 
CCCC MODEL Task Team did not include iron, so we have developed a new ecosystem model including iron 
cycling with the new Optimal Uptake (OU) kinetics for multiple nutrients.  Smith and Yamanaka (2007) and 
Smith et al. (2009) showed that, compared to the classic Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics, OU kinetics better 
explains the observed nutrient uptakes from both laboratory and shipboard experiments. By fitting the 
respective versions (MM and OU kinetics) of an identical ecosystem model to the same data, Smith et al. 
(2010) have rigorously compared MM and OU kinetics in a modeling study of the SERIES iron-enrichment 
experiment. MM kinetics could not reproduce the observed increase in Si uptake rate as a function of the 
decreasing trend in concentration of silicic acid. Also, the MM kinetics predicts Si limitation throughout nearly 
all of the experiment after iron-fertilization.  By contrast, OU kinetics reproduces the observed increase in Si 
uptake rate and matches the observed estimate for the timing of the return to iron limitation.  Previous studies 
have shown that including the iron cycle (with MM kinetics) has fixed problems in models without iron (e.g., 
overestimates of chlorophyll-a in the Southern Ocean and of nutrient concentration in the subarctic North 
Pacific). However, the inclusion of the iron cycle has degraded model performance for some regions, such as 
the Equatorial Pacific.  We are estimating the key parameters of our model with OU kinetics for 17 sites, 
including JGOFS stations.

Extended Abstract 
 
We examine the interplay between marine ecosystem structure and iron supply in the context of a global three-
dimensional ocean model where self-assembling phytoplankton communities emerge from a set of potentially 
viable organism types, including diazotrophs. The parameterization of the iron cycling includes representations 
of advection/diffusion, biological uptake, remineralization, aeolian and sedimentary sources, as well as explicit 
complexation with an organic ligand and scavenging (Parekh et al., 2005).  We explore how the availability of 
iron critically regulates the ecosystem structure in the modeled Pacific, and how the ecosystem itself controls 
iron concentrations. We use resource competition theory (Tilman et al., 1977, 1982) to understand our results. 
Competition resource theory suggests a strong link between ecosystem structure and nutrient concentrations 
and supply. In the simplest form (see Dutkiewicz et al., 2009) it suggests that phytoplankton biomass is 
controlled by the supply of the limiting nutrient and the phytoplankton loss rates (e.g., grazing). In turn, the 
concentration of the limiting nutrient is controlled, not by the supply rate, but rather by the phytoplankton 
physiology and loss rates. 
 
Firstly we explore how different assumptions about the solubility of Aeolian dust deposited iron affect the 
phytoplankton biomass, distribution of diazotrophs and concentration of iron. We examine simulations where 
we assume uniform solubility  (4% and 1% ) of  the iron dust estimates of  Luo et al. (2003), as well as newer 
estimates of spatially variable solubility (Luo et al., 2008). We compare results between the different 
experiments. We find, as have several studies (e.g., Moore et al., 2004, Moore and Doney, 2007, 
Krishnamurthy et al., 2009), that increased iron supply (here due to higher solubility) leads to slightly higher 
global primary production, and significantly higher global nitrogen fixation. Here, we concentrate on the 
differences in the experiments seen in the North and central Pacific. 
 
The spatial patterns of differences of local biomass and iron between experiments are quite complicated. We 
find that resource competition theory does explain many of the differences: 
1. Where the limiting nutrient of the dominant phytoplankton is iron, biomass increases with increasing iron 
solubility, but ambient iron concentrations remain fairly constant. 
2. Increased nitrate consumption in these regions leads to reduced lateral supply of nitrogen to surrounding 
regions (e.g., Williams and Follows, 2003; Dutkiewicz et al., 2005), resulting in a decrease in biomass 
downstream. 
3. Increased iron solubility leads to larger regions where diazotrophs can exist (though they are never 
dominant). Nitrogen fixation increases leads to a larger supply of nitrogen which allows a larger biomass of 
non-diazotrophs. 
 
Appendix 4 WG 22 Annual Reports and Topic Session/Workshop Summaries  
PICES Scientific Report No. 42  47 
We consider two additional sensitivity experiments where we examine what happens if we “alter” the 
physiology of the phytoplankton, in particular we change the value of the Monod iron half saturation constant. 
Resource competition theory predicts accurately the altered iron concentration and also that biomass remains 
unaltered. In addition, we find that the region inhabited by diazotrophs changes: This too is suggested by 
resource competition theory (explored further in Monterio et al., 2009). 
 
From a modeling perspective these results suggest that we cannot simulate ecosystems correctly before good 
parameterizations of iron supply, but also we will not be able to capture iron concentrations without 
successfully parameterizing the ecosystem structure and physiology. More importantly however, this work 
helps us further our understanding of the strong coupling between ecology and nutrient cycling.

To investigate the effect of Asian dust on picophytoplankton, we carried out laboratory experiments for the 
variations of growth rate and DNA cell cycle on Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus after addition of Asian 
dust. There are no differences in the growth rates of control samples and experimental samples with additions 
of 5%, 20%, 50% Asian dust, respectively. The specific growth rates of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus 
in the experiment with additions of 50% Asian dust were lower than others and the additions of 20% and 50% 
Asian dust also induced a Synechococcus cell cycle response. But the 50% addition of Asian dust was a high 
concentration relative to the concentration in the ocean during Asian dust periods. These results indicated that 
a high concentration Asian dust has a physiological effect on picophytoplankton growth and cell cycle.

REPORT OF WORKING GROUP 22 ON 
IRON SUPPLY AND ITS IMPACT ON BIOGEOCHEMISTRY AND 
ECOSYSTEMS IN THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN 
 
 
The final meeting of the Working Group on Iron Supply and its Impact on Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems in 
the North Pacific Ocean (hereafter WG 22) was held from 14:00–18:00 hours on October 24, 2010.  The Co-
Chairmen, Drs. Fei Chai and Shigenobu Takeda, called the meeting to order and welcomed the participants 
(WG 22 Endnote 1).  The draft agenda was reviewed and adopted (WG 22 Endnote 2).  As WG 22 will be 
disbanded in 2010, the Co-Chairmen expressed appreciation to the WG 22 members and to all scientists who 
contributed to the workshop and the annual meeting session proposed by the Working Group. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 2 
Review of WG 22 activities 
 
Iron biogeochemistry data sets in the North Pacific 
Data collected by WG 22 during its term (2007–2010) include dates, position (station, depth), cruise #, iron 
measurements (size, analytical method). A map of the stations and a list of the data sources will be prepared. 
Dissolved iron data sets collected from Japanese scientists are being work on. WG 22 members (Drs. Takeda, 
Mark Wells and William Crawford) will contact other key scientists who have made iron measurements in the 
North Pacific in order to collect as much available iron data as possible. The database may include 
cruise/station information in which iron samples were collected and analyzed but have not been published. 
 
Report on BIO Topic Session 2 (S2)  
To review the past and ongoing laboratory, field and modeling studies on iron biogeochemistry and its impact 
on biological productivity and marine ecosystems in the North Pacific Ocean, WG 22 convened the BIO Topic 
Session co-sponsored by SOLAS (Surface Ocean-Lower Atmosphere Study) on “Understanding the role of 
iron in regulating biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem structures in the North Pacific Ocean” at the PICES-
2010 in Portland, U.S.A. Participation included scientists from Canada, China, Germany, Japan, and the 
United States (WG 22 Endnote 3). There were 11 oral presentations focusing on iron biogeochemistry and the 
impact of iron (dust) on ecosystem dynamics, based on field observations, onboard experiments and numerical 
models. A summary of the session is included in the Session Summaries section of this Annual Report.  Co-
convenors (Drs. Angelica Peña, Toshiro Saino and Mark Wells) will ask invited speakers to submit extended 
abstracts with key figures and tables to be included in the WG 22 final report. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 3 
Basic questions and recommendations for the future of iron studies within PICES 
 
The Working Group discussed basic questions regarding the future of iron studies within PICES. It was agreed 
that the next phase of iron research in the North Pacific will involve:   
 ecosystem responses to changes in iron supply rate, amount, and pathway, 
 dissolution or biological availability and residence time of suspended particulate Fe (from rivers, 
resuspended sediments, industrial combustion, and dust), 
 mechanisms controlling chemical speciation of Fe in seawater and interaction of Fe binding organic 
ligands with particulate Fe, 
WG 22 Annual Reports and Topic Session/Workshop Summaries  Appendix 4 
50  PICES Scientific Report No. 42 
 dynamics of Fe binding organic ligands, and 
 interactions of iron with other stressors such as pH, Cu, etc. 
 
For improving ecosystem models that include an iron cycle, more information is needed on: 
 iron removal and recycling, 
 iron sources,  
 physiology of co-limitation by iron and other parameters, and  
 grazing on phytoplankton communities. 
 
The Working Group agreed that they needed to have a better understanding of the iron supply before they can 
get ecosystems right, but they also need to get ecosystems right before they can get the iron concentration 
right. 
 
WG 22 recommended that PICES should support:  
 integration of regional studies on iron biogeochemical cycles and its ecosystem impacts, 
 development of a North Pacific database for iron and related parameters, 
 symposium/annual meeting sessions on the role of iron in regulating ecosystem responses to natural and 
anthropogenic forcing in the North Pacific, and 
 model inter-comparisons activities. 
 
WG 22 term of reference 5 “Elucidate the role of iron as a potential regulator of harmful algal bloom (HAB) 
in coastal ecosystems of the North Pacific” has not been fully taken up for discussion in WG 22. Therefore, it 
is suggested that this topic could be incorporated into the activity plans of HAB-S and/or FUTURE.  
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 4 
Publication of the WG 22 final report  
 
A draft of the final report will be prepared for the PICES Scientific Report series in April 2011. The contents 
and assignment of the WG 22 final report were discussed (WG 22 Endnote 4). WG 22 will also prepare a 
review to be submitted to Oceanography that summarizes the key issues on iron sources and cycling in the 
North Pacific and the Working Group recommendations for future iron studies in the North Pacific. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 5 
Future activities related to the work of WG 22 
 A workshop on Asian Dust and Ocean EcoSystem (ADOES), November 28–December 2, 2010; 
 A joint Quebec–Shandong provinces workshop on ocean acidification in Qingdao, December 6–8, 2010; 
 American Geophysical Union 2010 Fall Meeting, December 15:

Proposal for a new working group 
Dr. Maurice Levasseur (Canada) prepared a proposal for a new working group on “Sensitivity of the North 
Pacific to Atmospheric Iron Deposition in a Low pH Ocean” (WG-22 Endnote 5).  This proposal was discussed 
at the COVE-AP meeting on Friday, October 22, 2010 where they decided to include the topic as part of the 
mandate of their own Working Group proposal on “Ecosystem response to multiple stressors.”  COVE-AP felt 
that the topic of Dr. Levasseur’s proposal was too specialized and should be broadened to comprise other 
important issues that all PICES countries are interested in.  WG 22 recommended that COVE-AP consider 
nominating a few of WG 22’s current members (e.g., Levasseur, Wells, Chai, or Takeda) as potential members 
of the new working group to reflect the activities that have been accomplished by WG 22.

Rationale 
Twelve large-scale iron ocean fertilizations (IOFs) have been conducted so far in order to assess the impact of 
Fe deposition on primary production, carbon sequestration, climate-relevant trace gas emissions, and global 
climate (see reviews by de Barr et al., 2005; Boyd et al., 2007).  These experiments have shown that Fe-dust 
can increase, albeit modestly, carbon sequestration, and significantly affect the production and flux of DMS 
and other trace gases to the atmosphere (see review MEPS, 2008).  In several of these experiments, the 
dynamics of DMS were tightly coupled to the growth and decline of prymnesiophytes such as Emiliania 
huxleyi and Phaeocystis spp. which tended to respond quickly to iron addition.  These early blooms of 
prymnesiophytes also contributed to carbon production and sequestration by diverting a portion of the nutrients 
Appendix 4 WG 22 Annual Reports and Topic Session/Workshop Summaries 
PICES Scientific Report No. 42  53 
from the diatom blooms.  Several prymnesiophytes are calicifying organisms, which are highly sensitive to 
variations in pH.  Thus, the predicted decrease in oceanic pH could affect their response to iron availability. 
This could significantly alter the impact of atmospheric iron deposition on the North Pacific ecosystems.  
 
Central Objective 
To determine how the predicted decrease in ocean pH will impact the response of the HNLC ecosystems to 
atmospheric iron deposition in the North Pacific. 
 
General Approaches 
This important question should ideally be addressed through large-scale in situ experiments (addition of dust, 
Fe, Fe+CO
2
, CO
2
, control).   But this represents a technical, financial, and logistical challenge probably out of 
reach.  For this reason, we propose to start with the development of onboard and in situ mesocosms protocols.  
Such protocols should allow maintaining a constant pH level for the duration of the experiment (several days).  
These experiments should be conducted in the different HNLC regions.  The target area for the PICES WG 22 
could be the North Pacific HNLC waters.  
 
Specific Approaches for WG 22 
In Canada, part of this project could be associated with the ongoing Line P cruise program led by the Institute 
of Ocean Sciences (IOS) of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO).  Additional days devoted to the 
project could be added to the two Line P summer cruises if we can find extra money (NSERC) to cover these 
extra days at sea.  Chinese colleagues could explore the possibility of obtaining a special research permit to use 
Chinese dust during PICES experiments.  Mesocosms have been developed for ocean pH studies by Dr. Ulf 
Riebesell. Dr. Levasseur contacted him for potential use of the mesocosms at OSP). 
 
Contributions 
The proposed working group would contribute to bring together the following ongoing activities, foster 
additional collaborations, and help secure funding; 1) In Canada, Nadja Steiner (IOS-DFO) and Maurice 
Levasseur (Laval University) are already leading a project on the co-effect of Fe and pH on the North-East 
Pacific Ecosystem, 2) Maurice Levasseur (Laval University) and Gui-Peng Yang (Ocean University of China) 
received funds from the Government of Quebec (Canada) to conduct a joint Quebec–Shandong workshop on 
the impact of ocean acidification on marine resources and biogeochemical cycles. The objective of the 
workshop is to establish a new Quebec–Shandong joint multidisciplinary 3-year research program on the 
impact of ocean acidification and the functioning of marine ecosystems, coastal resources, and biogeochemical 
cycles.

Understanding the role of iron in regulating biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem structures in the North

Background 
 
Iron plays a key role in regulating the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen, and pelagic ecosystem 
structures in the North Pacific Ocean, yet our understanding of these effects remains limited.  External sources 
of iron, such as Asian dust, rivers, sediments, and volcanoes, supply large amounts of iron to the North Pacific, 
while the physical processes of upwelling, meso-scale eddies, boundary currents, and tidal mixing transport 
deep waters with high iron concentration to the upper ocean.  Biological uptake, zooplankton grazing, re-
mineralization, and iron chemistry change the forms of iron and its distribution in the North Pacific Ocean.  
This session invited papers that address physical, biological and chemical processes controlling iron 
distribution and transformation, linkages between iron and ecosystem responses, and impacts on carbon and 
nitrogen cycles.  Of special interest were papers that combine recent progress from field observations and 
modeling studies that relate iron cycling to ecosystem structures and carbon fluxes in the North Pacific Ocean. 
 
Summary of presentations 
 
The BIO/SOLAS Topic Session was held on Tuesday, October 26, 2010 and consisted of 11 oral presentations 
(including 2 invited talks). About 50 persons attended the session and generated interesting discussion.  The 
papers presented at this session covered a wide range of topics from iron chemistry, sources, and distribution 
and iron impacts on plankton dynamics and DMS production.  The first invited talk gave an introduction to 
iron chemistry and presented an overview on recent progress in studying how the chemical form of iron 
impacts its bioavailability.  The second invited talk addressed the response of the marine ecosystem to natural 
iron fertilization by Asian dust.  Dust storms carry a large amount of aerosol particles to the ocean which 
substantially affects surface biological production.  The remaining talks covered a wide range of topics 
including mechanisms controlling dissolved iron distribution, sources and transport of iron by vertical winter 
mixing, eddies and currents, impact of Asian dust on DMS production, the role of zooplankton in smoothing 
the geographical heterogeneity of primary productivity generated by iron availability and the potential of ocean 
fertilization to sequester carbon.  In addition, an overview of the activities of the international Surface Ocean-
Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS) project was presented, including those which plans for iron related work.

The marine geochemistry of Fe is inextricably linked with the cycle of growth, vertical transport and 
remineralization of marine microbes.  The availability of Fe to vegetative cells can affect the species 
composition, ecological structure and productivity of the phytoplankton community. Indeed, we now recognize 
WG 22 Annual Reports and Topic Session/Workshop Summaries  Appendix 4 
56  PICES Scientific Report No. 42 
that phytoplankton affect: 1) the distribution of Fe through active cellular uptake and subsequent sinking of 
organic matter to depth, and 2) the physicochemical speciation of Fe through the production of strong 
complexing ligands.  The marine biogeochemistry of Fe and C are thus intimately coupled, in that the supply 
of Fe to ocean surface waters regulates the synthesis of organic matter by phytoplankton, and, ultimately, the 
export of organic carbon from the surface to the ocean interior.  However, our current understanding of the 
sources, sinks and chemical speciation of Fe, especially as it relates to bioavailability, in the upper ocean is 
incomplete.  Here we will provide an overview of recent progress by chemists and microbial physiologists, 
sometimes working side by side, studying how the chemical form of Fe impacts its bioavailability.  Insights 
provided by metal-metal interactions during microbial uptake between Fe and Cd and Fe and Cu in the North 
Pacific will also be summarized.

Redox cycling of iron in natural seawater is an important process that can affect iron availability to marine 
phytoplankton, but one that often is overlooked in modelling iron effects on ocean ecosystems.  We used 
luminol chemiluminescence to measure picomolar Fe(II) oxidation rates in continental shelf waters and surface 
(upper 200 m) waters of the iron-limited eastern subarctic Pacific.  In both cases, Fe(II) oxidation rates were 
markedly faster in waters from the surface mixed layer and chlorophyll maximum depth than rates measured in 
UV oxidized seawater (UVOS). Conversely, Fe(II) oxidation rates measured in waters from below the mixed 
layer agreed well with UVOS rates.  Even so, Fe(II) oxidation rates in surface and chlorophyll maximum 
waters slowed to converge with UVOS rates with stepwise Fe(II) and Fe(III) additions.  These Fe titrations did 
not affect Fe(II) oxidation rates in waters from below the mixed layer. We hypothesize that excess 
concentrations of strong Fe(III)-complexing organic ligands known to occur in seawater accelerate Fe(II) 
oxidation at the surface and chlorophyll maximum; a process that we titrated away with stepwise Fe additions. 
Given that Fe(II) oxidation rates were enhanced only in the surface mixed layer, our findings suggest that the 
chemical nature, biological availability, and perhaps origin of natural Fe(III)-complexing organic ligands may 
differ in surface and deep waters.

Mechanisms controlling dissolved iron distribution in the North Pacific are examined by numerical simulation. 
We use the Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling (BEC) model with the resolution of roughly 1° in horizontal 
directions and 60 vertical levels.  The model reproduces well the iron distribution in available field data: the 
surface concentrations are broadly below 0.2 nM; the concentrations increase with depth; and those in the 
lower thermocline are especially high in the northwestern region and off the coast of California.  Furthermore, 
the simulated result corresponds well to observed sections.  Experiments changing scavenging regimes and 
external iron sources reveal that lateral transport of sedimentary iron into the open ocean causes the high 
concentrations in the northwestern region and off the coast of California.  The penetration only appears under a 
scavenging regime where iron has a relatively long residence time at high concentrations, namely, the order of 
years. Sedimentary iron is intensively supplied around continental margins, resulting in locally high 
concentrations; the residence time with respect to scavenging determines the horizontal scale for plumes of 
elevated sedimentary iron.  Budget analysis for iron reveals that the existence of offshore directed currents is 
essential for sedimentary iron transport to the open ocean.

Much of the northeast Pacific Ocean is labeled high-nutrient (nitrate), low-chlorophyll (HNLC) based on years 
of sampling of ocean-surface nutrients by research vessels.  Year-to-year changes in the shape and extent of 
this region are difficult to track, since there are few wide-area, ship-based surveys to sample nutrients over the 
region.  It is now possible to track the movement of different water masses based on ocean-surface chlorophyll 
measured from satellite and on changes in currents determined by satellite-altimetry and Argo profilers.  I will 
combine these measurements with ship-based sampling to reveal changes in the HNLC domain over the past 
decade.

Dust storm carries a large amount of aerosol particles, sweeps continents and exports to oceans. When these 
aerosol particles deposit in ocean, which provides abundant nutrients such as nitrogen and iron for ocean 
ecosystem, increases the primary production and induces algae bloom.  Asian dust storm generates at a high 
latitude and a high elevation and is obvious a hemispheric scale phenomenon.  Asian dust is unique not only in 
morphology, soil texture, and dust storm activities, but also mixing and capturing anthropogenic air pollutants 
on the transport pathway.  Deposition of Asian dust substantially affects surface biological productivity.  To 
improve understandings of Asian dust and its effect on ocean ecosystem from the coastal sea to open ocean, 
ADOES (Asian Dust and Ocean EcoSystem) was proposed under the frame of international SOLAS (Surface 
Ocean-Lower Atmosphere Study).  A series of studies were performed in high-nutrient low-chlorophyll 
(HNLC), low-nutrient low-chlorophyll (LNLC) and eutrophication coastal regions of the Pacific Ocean.  These 
studies provided evidence of biotic response to natural iron fertilization caused by Asian dust particles in the 
WG 22 Annual Reports and Topic Session/Workshop Summaries  Appendix 4

subarctic North Pacific and showed that dust storm episodes were significant in the initiation of spring blooms 
in the East China Sea.  On-board incubations on the cruise in a LNLC region of the western Pacific at the 
southeast of Japan showed different responses of ocean ecosystem to nitrogen and dust fertilization. 
Correlation of the Asian dust storms with chlorophyll, primary productivity and algae blooms in the coastal 
seas of China from 1998 to 2008 were illustrated.

The Alaskan Gyre is a High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll region (HNLC) characterized in summer by 
exceptionally high concentrations of dimethylsulfide (DMS), a biogenic gas with a potential cooling effect on 
climate.  Surface waters in this region are sporadically replenished with Fe by aeolian dust wet deposition, 
events which can results in natural blooms.  During the June 2009 and 2010 Line P cruises we conducted a 
series of onboard incubation experiments where surface water collected along Line P were enriched with dust 
samples from different Asian sources.  Dust samples were added at concentrations of 0.12mg/L, 0.5mg/L and 
2mg/L in 5L incubation bags.  The incubations lasted between 48h and 96 h and the following variables were 
measured at T0, T24, T48 and T96: dissolved Fe, macronutrients, primary production, nitrogen fixation, 
chlorophyll a, phytoplankton and bacterial abundance, dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and 
dimethylsulfide (DMS).  Preliminary results will be presented and discussed in the context of reported impact 
of natural dust storm and artificial large scale fertilization experiments.

Multi-year (2003-2008) time series observations along the A-line provided information on the temporal 
variability of the dissolved iron (diss-Fe) concentration in the Oyashio region of the western subarctic Pacific 
and the data indicate that an annual cycle of surface diss-Fe occurs every year.  Diss-Fe was supplied into the 
surface water in this region every winter and supports the spring phytoplankton bloom after development of 
the thermocline.  The diss-Fe concentration was drawn down during the phytoplankton bloom period, and was 
depleted in summer in some water masses.  Then diss-Fe increased from autumn to winter with the increasing 
Appendix 4 WG 22 Annual Reports and Topic Session/Workshop Summaries 
PICES Scientific Report No. 42  59 
depth of the surface mixed layer.  The high diss-Fe concentrations in the surface layer in winter were 
controlled by mesoscale oceanic intrinsic processes, such as vertical winter mixing and horizontal Fe-rich 
intermediate water transport.  Difference in magnitude of the winter mixing processes among different water 
masses caused the heterogeneous distribution of diss-Fe concentration in the surface layer. Substantially higher 
diss-Fe/NO
3
 ratio in the winter surface layer region has a high potential to stimulate phytoplankton growth 
caused by the high Fe availability allowing high potential of macro-nutrients utilization.  Dust events were rare 
in the period when the surface diss-Fe concentration increased, therefore, the consistently occurring spring 
diatom blooms in the Oyashio region are concluded to be fuelled by the oceanic Fe supply.

Iron is the most essential factor controlling the ecosystems structure and dynamics of the subarctic North 
Pacific (SNP).  Iron limitation prevents nitrate uptake of phytoplankton in most oceanic regions of the SNP 
and maintains the nitrate concentration high.  Eastward decrease in iron supply brings the contrast of the nitrate 
drawdown and phytoplankton composition between eastern and western subarctic gyres. In iron-replete 
regions, such as the Oyashio region, centric diatoms consume nitrate and form extensive bloom in spring.  In 
spite of large regional differences in phytoplankton biomass and composition, regional difference in 
zooplankton composition is less distinct. Large calanoid copepods Neocalanus spp., Eucalanus bungii and 
Metridia pacifica are dominant throughout the SNP.  Recent studies on the transportation of Neocalanus 
showed that a significant fraction of the population in a oceanic domain was passively transported to other 
ocean domains within a generation.  This suggests zooplankton with long life cycle (months – 2 years) transfer 
primary production to higher trophic levels after smoothing the geographical heterogeneity of primary 
productivity.  We will discuss the relationship between iron supply, passive transportation of zooplankton and 
biogeography of higher trophic levels.

Numerous mesoscale eddies occur each year in the Gulf of Alaska, but their statistical characteristics and 
impact on biogeochemical cycles have never been substantially investigated.  A Pacific basin-wide three-
dimensional coupled physical-biogeochemical model has been developed and the results for the Gulf of Alaska 
are used to quantify the eddy activities and the subsequent biogeochemical responses during the period of 
1993-2009.  Based on sea level anomaly (SLA), the Okubo-Weiss method is used to identify eddies and a 
WG 22 Annual Reports and Topic Session/Workshop Summaries  Appendix 4 
60  PICES Scientific Report No. 42 
connectivity algorithm is used to track eddies in this study.  In order to evaluate the model performance, the 
modeled results are compared with the satellite derived SLA.  The impacts of mesoscale eddies to the 
biogeochemical processes are evaluated with the model results.  The iron transport from the coast to the Gulf 
will be estimated with the model results.  The total nitrate and silicate uptake within the eddies each year are 
calculated.  This study suggests that mesoscale eddies in the Gulf of Alaska are important sources of iron to the 
euphotic zone, which plays a significant role in regulating the biogeochemical cycle in the Gulf of Alaska.

The Surface Ocean - Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS) project is an international research initiative focusing 
on biogeochemical interactions at the air-sea interface and the immediately adjacent marine and atmospheric 
boundary layers.  It is a co-sponsored project of SCOR (Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research), IGBP 
(International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme), WCRP (World Climate Research Programme) and iCACGP 
(Commission for Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Pollution), comprising over 1600 scientists in 25 
countries.  SOLAS science has developed and matured considerably since publication of its Science Plan and 
Implementation Strategy in 2004 and there have been a number of broad-based national SOLAS research 
programs and related projects.  In 2008, pressing scientific issues and areas where progress can be accelerated 
significantly with the support of SOLAS were identified and referred to as the SOLAS mid-term strategy. 
These topics will be presented including the topic “Atmospheric control of nutrient cycling and production in 
the surface ocean” under which plans for iron-related work are being developed.

Ocean fertilization may offer a potential strategy for removing CO
2
 from the atmosphere by stimulating the 
growth of phytoplankton and thereby sequestering CO
2
 in the form of particulate organic carbon.  Scientific 
studies into the potential mechanisms for global climate modulation involving ocean fertilization activities 
have consistently demonstrated the stimulation of phytoplankton biomass through the addition of macro or 
micro nutrients in certain nutrient-deficient areas of the oceans.  However, an incomplete understanding of the 
linkages and drivers within this complex system introduces uncertainty in the extrapolation of experimental 
observations to the temporal and spatial scales proposed for carbon sequestration by commercial ocean 
fertilization.  Based on available information, four key factors limiting research on ocean fertilization are 
highlighted in this review: 1) a dearth of baseline information in the areas suitable for fertilization restrict the 
accurate observation and monitoring of impacts to marine biodiversity resulting from the alteration of chemical 
and biological processes; 2) the influence of natural variability and fluctuations in biogeochemical processes 
within the oceans on sequestration efficiency is not clear; 3) the costs, benefits and shortcomings of ocean 
fertilization cannot be accurately assessed; and 4) ocean fertilization, even carried out as legitimate scientific 
research, presents serious challenges for the law of the sea.
