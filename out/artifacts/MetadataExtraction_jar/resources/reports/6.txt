I. REPORT ON THE PICES WORKSHOP ON THE OKHOTSK SEA AND
ADJACENT AREAS
Yutaka Nagata, Vyacheslav B. Lobanov and Lynne D. Talley
(Co-Chairmen of the Scientific Steering Committee for the Workshop)
1. Outline of the Workshop
The PICES Workshop on the Okhotsk Sea and Adjacent Areas was held at the Pacific Academy of
Management and Business in Vladivostok, Russia, on June 19-24, 1995.
Prof. W.S. Wooster, the
Chairman of PICES addressed the meeting at the opening ceremony on July 19.
Following the
opening ceremony, a keynote lecture on Physical Oceanography of the Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio
Region was given by Prof. L.D. Talley, the Chairman of the former PICES Working Group 1.
Four
more keynote lectures were given: Biota of the Okhotsk sea: Structure of communities,
its interannual
dynamics and currents by V.P. Shuntov and E.P. Dulepova; Maritime nature use problems by B.V.
Preobrazhensky; Northwest Pacific paleohydrography by L.D. Keigwin;
and Bank of fishery-
biological and oceanographical data by L.N. Bocharov and V.K. Ozerin.
Eight parallel sessions were held under the following titles:
A) Circulation and water mass structure of the Okhotsk Sea and northwestern Pacific
B) Sea ice and its relation to circulation and climate
C) Waves and tides
D) Physical oceanography of the Japan/East Sea
E) Communities of the Okhotsk Sea and adjacent waters: composition, structure and dynamics
F) Abundance, distribution, dynamics of the common fishes of the Okhotsk Sea
G) Salmon of the Okhotsk Sea: biology, abundance and stock identification
H) Biodiversity of island ecosystems and seaside's of the North Pacific
The workshop Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) recognized that many of the items discussed in the
biodiversity session would be outside of the present scope of PICES, but gave consent to utilize the
occasion if it was beneficial to Russian scientists. 97 oral papers (including sixteen papers by overseas
investigators) were presented and 44 were presented in the poster sessions.
144 scientists attended the
various sessions. A rapporteur was nominated for each session during the first meeting of the SSC and
time was allowed for discussion at the end of each session. Free discussions were held, on a one day
excursion on the R/V Academik M.A. Lavrentiev, that proved very useful for creating mutual
understanding among participants. A second meetings of SSC was held on the vessel in order to
discuss and prepare a draft workshop report for Science Board to review at the Fourth Annual Meeting
in Qingdao. Additionally, a special meeting on data management was held.
A plenary session was held to present summary reports of the eight sessions and approve the outline of
the workshop report. Finally, Prof. W.S. Wooster provided closing remarks to the workshop.
2. Summary reports from sessions
The summary reports from the workshop sessions given by the rapporteurs are below.
Additional
recommendations from discussion in the SSC meetings, in the meeting on data management and in the
1
plenary session are added at the end of each report and at the end of this document in the
recommendations of the workshop.
A. Circulation and water mass structure of the Okhotsk Sea and northwestern Pacific
Rapporteur: S.C. Riser (University of Washington, U.S.A.)
From the wide variety of talks and posters presented at this session the following main themes
emerged:
a) There is a great deal of research activity taking place in the Okhotsk Sea and its adjacent
waters, perhaps more than at any time in recent history. There is interest in the Okhotsk
Sea in many of the countries that are members of PICES, due to both local economic and
social issues and to questions concerning the impact of the Okhotsk Sea on the larger-scale
North Pacific circulation. Included in this research are efforts to synthesize historical data
sets into a larger picture of the flow in and around the Okhotsk Sea, such as Talley's large-
scale picture of Okhotsk Sea-North Pacific interaction and Luchin's attempts to
characterize the tides over a large portion of the Okhotsk Sea.
b) Rapid progress is being made to improve the Okhotsk Sea data bases (i.e., water masses,
tides, ice cover, atmospheric parameters). Important zero-order problems remain, such as
determining the long-term exchange between the Okhotsk Sea and the North Pacific Ocean.
c) As the data bases continue to improve, more quantitative studies should be initiated. Some
models of the Okhotsk Sea circulation are already operational and the improved data bases
should help to constrain these models. Quantitative studies of many kinds, including
inverse models, box models, and process-oriented models should now begin, and should be
compared and contrasted with the new data, in an attempt to fully exploit the observational
data base.
Related discussion in the SSC meetings and the plenary session:
a) This workshop was built on past PICES activities, especially the work of WG 1/POC and
its issue of the PICES Scientific Report No. 2, 1995 on the Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio
Region. This workshop was also very successful not only as it reviewed the recent
investigations on physical oceanography in the region but also facilitated information
exchanges among nations, agencies, and individual investigators. This is an important step
for future international, bilateral and individual investigations.
b) Further understanding of the physical processes in the regions and their impacts on world
climate is urgent. Organized international cooperative studies are suggested, such as:
i) the dense water formation in the shelf regions of the northwest Okhotsk Sea,
ii) water exchanges between the Okhotsk Sea and the North Pacific Ocean,
iii) the role of the Soya Current on physical processes in the Okhotsk Sea,
iv) the detailed formation processes of the North Pacific Intermediate Water including
water mass modification in the Oyashio and Mixed Water Regions.
Modeling efforts might move in the direction of combining with the larger subarctic
region, which influences the circulation and properties of the Okhotsk Sea.
c) There is no reason to maintain a steering committee for studies of the Okhotsk Sea and
adjacent areas in POC or in the Science Board after the final report of the meeting is
produced. We recommend for POC, however, to maintain interest in this region, and to
organize a well focused symposium or a new working group in future. The next
2
symposium may be held around 1998 on the Okhotsk coast of Hokkaido, Japan (e.g.
Nemuro or Mombetsu), or at the time of the PICES Annual Assembly.
d) In order to study the important physical processes, we need much more detailed data,
which we hope that TCODE can assist in obtaining.
For example, high resolution CTD
data of 1 to 2-decibar interval in the Oyashio and Mixed Water Regions are essential to
clarify the formation mechanisms of the North Pacific Intermediate Water, but such data
are not routinely archived.
B. Sea ice and its relation to circulation and climate
Rapporteur: M. Aota (Hokkaido University, Japan)
There were seven presentations during this session that can be classified into four groups:
a) Characteristics of sea ice in the Okhotsk Sea; Dr. Yakunin provided statistical evidence of
the peculiarities of the sea ice in the Okhotsk Sea, and Dr. Polomoshnov reported on the
behavior of sea ice off the east coast of Sakhalin from point of view of oil development.
b) Relationship among magnitude of sea ice in the Okhotsk Sea and atmospheric and oceanic
conditions; Dr. Sekine suggested that a teleconnection exists among the variations in sea
ice areas in the Okhotsk Sea, from the intensity of the subarctic circulation in the North
Pacific, and from the air temperature on the Asian continent.
Dr. Petrov reported the
interaction between the hydrological structure in the active layer and the ice cover in the
Okhotsk Sea. Dr. Dashko pointed out that the monthly mean temperature and precipitation
over the South Far East Region is linearly connected with atmospheric parameters over
the
Okhotsk region in summer.
c) Wind waves and surges in the Okhotsk Sea and Kuril Islands region, Dr. Polyakova
described the nature of wind waves and surges in the Okhotsk Sea and Kuril Island Region
by using synoptic data and,
d) Technical method in studies of sea ice dynamics;
Dr. Lebedev reported that acoustic
methods are useful for studies of sea ice dynamics.
C. Waves and tides
Rapporteur: Y. Nagata (Mie University, Japan)
Four papers were presented: satellite observation of surface and internal waves, paleo-tsunami
investigation by analyzing sediment columns in marshes, and computational techniques of
tsunamis and tides. Several papers on forecasting wind waves and storm surges were given in
the poster session. In addition, several papers on tides and tidal mixing appeared in session A
and one paper on oceanic waves in the session D.
Tidal currents are strong enough to destroy oceanic stratification in the Okhotsk sea Region
and to create thick homogeneous layers especially in the shelf and bank regions and in straits
of the Kuril Islands. Further investigation is warranted as the mixing plays an important role
in water mass modification in the Okhotsk Sea and adjacent areas. It was also pointed out that
typhoons and strong cyclones may produce strong vertical mixing in the subarctic oceans
where the oceanic stratification is relatively weak.
Importance of nonlinearity and baroclinicity structures has not yet been clarified, thus, there is
still a need for more elaborate observational efforts.
3
Participants agreed that modeling and forecasting of tsunamis is an important subject in the
region and PICES should support the activities of the relevant organizations such as ITSU, the
IUGG Tsunami Commission.
D. Physical oceanography of the Japan/East Sea
Rapporteur: C.N.K. Mooers (Miami University, U.S.A.)
Two main topics were discussed concerning observations and models:
a) The circulation of the Japan/East Sea; Prof. Kozlov presented a new (quasi-geostrophic)
theory for "background currents" (or, mean circulation) for semi-enclosed seas, was
applied to the Japan/East Sea. The "background currents" consist of three components:
planetary, topographic and "running" (or throughflow). As a result, two-to-three main
gyres (and one of the Tsushima branch currents) occur, depending upon an unknown
parameter (alpha) for a two-layered regime. This model can assist the interpretation of
both observations and numerical simulations.
Dr. Goncharenko (for Drs. Danchenkov, Kim, and Takematsu) summarized the studies of
the subpolar front, "chimney" region (off Vladivostok), and of Japan/East Sea Proper
Water by the joint Japanese, South Korean and Russian CREAMS Program, including
CTD/ADCP cruises and current meter moorings from 1993 to 1995 and for future plans.
Dr. Ro described studies of the East Korean Warm Current (and, especially, of a recurrent
anticyclone) by a consortium of (South) Korean universities.
Prof. Mooers presented results on the 10-day spin-up of the high-resolution [about 10 km
and 20 sigma (terrain-following) levels], wind-and-inflow-driven Japan/East Sea Princeton
Ocean model, noting the barotropic adjustment (including strong subsurface jets and deep
flow) due to a strong JEBAR (topography/pressure gradient) interaction associated with the
coarse, over-smooth Levitus climatology. The most notable feature is the development of
a strong cyclonic circulation poleward of the subpolar front. The fully spun-up model, and
then the annual cycle, will be of considerable interest in comparison with observations and
other models.
Overall, there is now an improved bases for close coordination between observations and
modeling to rapidly increase our understanding of the circulation.
b) The ventilation of the Japan/East Sea; Prof. Yakunin presented his analysis of salt flux as
a by-product of ice production in the Tartarski Strait, Dr. Ponomarev presented his
analysis of mixing as a by-product of ice production in Peter the Great Bay, and Dr.
Goncharenko presented his analysis of the pre-conditioned, cyclonic eddy (and suspected
"chimney") region over the seamount near the continental slope and surface front off
Vladivostok. Though the chemists estimate about 1 % of the deepwater is produced each
year, the physicists cannot (yet) account for that much from these three sources.
Overall, there is a lack of observations (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, etc.) in
wintertime near the coast, and over the continental shelf and slope in general. It may be
necessary to integrate along all the coastal bays (and over the shelf/slope) of the Primorye
Coast. Not much addressed yet, is the interannual variability in the ventilation processes.
4
Discussions:
There was lively discussion, making it clear that there is both great interest and
controversy on these topics, which indicates a strong basis for scientific collaboration and
rapid progress in the near future.
Recommendations:
a) An international, long-term (about 10 yrs) study is needed of the Japan/East Sea circulation
and ventilation processes, including coordinated observational and modeling efforts.
b) A special emphasis is needed on the subpolar front, annual cycle, interannual variability,
and coastal ocean processes.
c) Air-sea interaction processes (especially associated with ventilation) need to be addressed
on an (atmospheric) synoptic time scale with daily resolution, rather than with monthly
averages on events. For example, establishment of a meteorological buoy near 42°N,
132°E would be particularly revealing of ventilation events and help to qualify the rate of
deepwater formation.
d) There is a need for observations of jet trapped continental margin and seamount
topography as indicated in various numerical models.
e) Deployment of numerous Lagrangian drifters, especially subsurface (RAFOS) floats at
intermediate depths and vertically cycling (ALACE) floats (to sample the mass field in the
(pycnocline) for two or more years would be very revealing of the general, mesoscale, and
transient circulation.
f) There is a need to organize a high-resolution (about 1/4 degree) seasonal ocean climatology
to support both observational and modeling studies. For this, an international effort is
needed to aggregate and manage both physical and chemical data.
g) It is important for all interested countries and institutions to be involved in both the
observational and modeling studies so that model-data and model-model comparisons can
be made. In particular, it is important that POI become directly involved in the numerical
modeling studies; for this, one or more powerful PCs or (preferably) workstations
dedicated to modeling would be needed.
h) Finally, creation of PICES Working Group on the Japan/East Sea circulation and
ventilation could facilitate the support and integration of CREAMS and other observational
campaigns with several ongoing modeling efforts.
E. Communities of the Okhotsk Sea and adjacent waters: composition, structure and dynamics
Rapporteur: O.S. Temnykh (TINRO, Russia)
Twelve oral presentations were made at this session. The range of interest was very wide and
concerned all organisms from microorganisms to whales. However, the main questions,
considered were the composition, structure and dynamics of plankton and nekton communities
of the Okhotsk Sea and the changes in ecosystems related to climatic-oceanological conditions.
The changes in epipelagic fish communities of the Okhotsk Sea are though to be caused by
climatic-oceanological changes. Total abundance of epipelagic fishes in the Okhotsk Sea
decreased by about 1.5 times and there is an obvious change in the ratio of the most common
species such as walleye pollock and herring.
5
Significant changes were also noted in nekton communities of the Pacific waters of the Kuril
Islands. Biomass of the epipelagic fishes decreased while the share of squids increased. Data
on species composition, abundance of the mesopelagic fishes as well as the interannual
dynamics of the trophic relations between plankton and mesopelagic nekton were investigated.
The decrease of abundance of predominant mesopelagic fish such as deep-sea smelt has been
established. Total plankton consumption by nekton also decreased.
Some presentations concerning plankton communities were made at the session:
a) An anomalous oceanological situation in 1993 in comparison with 1991-1992 is assumed to
have caused the high phytoplankton abundance in the Sakhalin-Kuril region.
b) No observed changes in plankton and benthic communities in the northeastern Sakhalin
shelf, where oil extraction occurs, was found. However, an oil spill appears to have cause
a large-scale death of zooplankton.
It was hypothesized that a high bioproductivity in northeastern Okhotsk Sea is conditioned by
the high concentration of mercury, which stimulates hydrobionts vitality and prolongs their
life. Therefore, current climatic-oceanological changes are presumed to initiate considerable
changes in the plankton and nekton communities of the Okhotsk Sea and adjacent water. A
mechanism of this influence is not clear and it appears to be a goal of further explorations.
Recommendations:
a) Mesopelagic fishes are very important in the functioning of an ecosystem. We propose to
conduct a special workshop "Mesopelagic fishes as the sea communities component"
b) Some fish species are important internationally (herring, pollock, sardine, saury, mackerel,
anchovy, salmon). Representatives at this workshop should form a working group to
collect and change all information on catch, size and age of these fishes.
c) A lot of information on composition, structure and long-term dynamics of the pelagic and
demersal communities has been collected in TINRO over more than ten years.
Therefore,
we propose to form a editorial board to prepare a review monograph on the biological
resources of the Okhotsk Sea (tentative name of this monograph may be "Ecosystems of
the Okhotsk Sea and Adjacent Waters")
F. Abundance, distribution, dynamics of the common fishes of the Okhotsk Sea
Rapporteur: T. Nishiyama (Hokkaido Tokai University, Japan)
The eight papers in this session dealt with the commercially important fish species in the
Okhotsk Sea. These included walleye pollock, herring, Greenland turbot and many other
flatfishes. Most of the papers have analyzed catch, abundance, migration, depth distribution,
spawning, and associated biological aspects. These papers were presented by Drs. Fadev,
Zolotov, Pushnikova, Dyakov and Nikolenko. Dr. Nishiyama reported Japanese fisheries
activities on the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido.
The historical data on several fish species were analyzed, and the long-term fluctuation of
abundance and the characteristics of population structures were discussed. The strong
yearclass and weak yearclass of fish were pointed out in pollock and herring, and the effects of
both natural and human factors were analyzed. The results of presented papers show that the
spawning, transport and dispersion of early life stages, depth distribution, and other biological
aspects were strongly influenced by the changes in circulation, flow pattern, eddies, water
6
temperature, and other oceanographic conditions. The studies also suggested some possible
ocean-atmosphere causes on the ecosystem dynamics.
Age determination of fish is an essential technique for the analysis of population structure in
fish stock assessment and management. Dr. McFarlane raised a question on the validity of the
present employed methods. The burnt otolith section method has indicated significant
discrepancies in annual count from the scale reading method, otolith surface method, and other
methods. Therefore, the necessity of re-examination of the age data previously determined by
the traditional methods is emphasized, and implication for pollock population dynamics and
environmental influence was addressed.
Walleye pollock is not only a major target species in many fisheries, but also a key species in
marine ecosystem. This fish is prey for marine mammals, sea birds and other large predatory
fishes. The partitioning of pollock resource to the human use and to the other animals is a
serious concern in the Bering Sea. Based on the analyses of biomass abundance, Dr.
Wespestad clarified the present status of pollock resources in different regions. The results
suggest the appropriate size for the pollock resource, the survival and abundance of the higher
trophic animals in the Bering Sea.
Some papers focused mainly on fluctuation in abundance of single species, but the changes in
fish community structure in relation to the abundance fluctuation of mixed species are of
serious concern. Therefore examining the changes in fish community structure should be
encouraged.
The presented papers and discussion in this session came to the following conclusions that
future research should be directed towards:
i) conducting comparative research on the causes of year-class variation of walleye pollock
around the Pacific rim,
ii) examining possible ocean atmosphere causes and effects on ecosystem dynamics,
iii) examining changes in fish community structure, and
iv) establishing an appropriate age determination method.
Recommendation:
Several papers have shown a common trend in abundance fluctuation of walleye pollock
between the Okhotsk and Bering Sea. Specific year-classes were strong and weak in both
areas, especially the very strong 1977-78 and 1988-1989 year-classes. Thus, participants in
this session believe it would be beneficial to hold a specific workshop on the causes of year-
class variation of walleye pollock around the Pacific rim.
G. Salmon of the Okhotsk Sea: biology, abundance and stock identification
Rapporteur: R.J. Beamish (Pacific Biological Station, Canada)
There were six oral presentations relating to salmon in this session. Topics ranged from
growth, survival and stock identification to new concepts of the factors affecting the dynamics
of pink salmon populations. Kamchatka pink salmon stocks were shown to be separate from
Sakhalin-Kuril region pink stocks in the ocean but overlapped during periods of higher
abundance. Using stock identification techniques to develop stock composition models, it was
observed that a small percentage (-6%) of the juvenile pink salmon in the Sea of Okhotsk
originated from Alaska stocks.
7
Feeding studies of pink, chum and sockeye indicated that feeding was mainly on zooplankton
during the day and not at night. Pink salmon fed principally on nekton and decapod larvae,
sockeye on hyperiids and chum on pteropods. River lamprey in Canada and Russia were
identified as major predators of salmon in some areas of the ocean, indicating that similar but
distinct species of salmon predators have common impacts on the marine survival of salmon.
The marine survival of hatchery-reared pink and chum salmon fry can be improved by
releasing smaller numbers earlier at the end of April and larger numbers in mid-May followed
by smaller releases at the end of the release period.
A new approach to forecasting the returns of pink salmon using chaos theory in a basic
production model allows for a more realistic way of incorporating the non linearity of the
"natural system".
There were no recommendations made after the session but later discussions identified the need
for a workshop on the behavior and population dynamics of pink salmon.
Recommendations:
Fish species that are important internationally are salmon and walleye pollock.
The
management issue related to pollock is the relative importance of fishing and natural changes in
abundance. Papers presented at the workshop provided information that pollock stocks may
not be overfished, may be overfished in some areas, or may fluctuate with trends in carrying
capacity.
a) Representatives at this workshop should form a working group to collate all information on
catch, size and age information of pollock in the Sea of Okhotsk.
b) Any future workshop should address the issue of the impact of short-term and long-term
changes in the climate/ocean environment on abundance trends of pollock.
The major issue in salmon was related to factors affecting marine survival and behavior of
pink salmon. At the southern part of the range, in the Amur and Fraser Rivers, returns in
recent years have been below forecasts; while in the more northerly areas, returns are
approximating historic high levels. In addition, there are suggestions by some scientists
that pinks may be straying more than in the past.
c) A special workshop (DICES sponsored) would bring together experts to determine what is
affecting pink salmon abundance and if the increased straying is real.
H. Biodiversity of island ecosystems and seaside's of the North Pacific
Rapporteur: B.I. Semkin (Pacific Institute of Geography, Russia)
In Vladivostok, the main center of marine, ecological and biological studies is located (Pacific
Institute of Oceanography, Pacific Institute of Geography, Institute of Marine Biology, Institute
of Biology and Pedology FEB RAS, etc.).
In this session scientists were involved in discussions on various aspects of the biodiversity
problem. 20 papers and a keynote lecture (B.V. Preobrazhensky, opened the session) were
discussed. The two days session was divided into four parts, and chaired by B.I. Semkin (2),
B.V. Preobrazhensky, A.G. Ablajev. Abstracts of twenty nine papers were published.
Scientists from Vladivostok (26), Magadan (3), Khabarovsk (2) and St. Petersburg (2) took
part in the workshop.
8
The main topics presented were:
a) biodiversity of marine, brackish water and terrestrial (coastal) ecosystem (salt marshes, dry
coastal ecosystems wetlands, forests, etc.),
b) biodiversity of shelf landscapes and their mapping,
c) biodiversity of terrestrial floras,
d) taxonomic diversity of vascular plants, lichens and fungi of Pacific sea coasts and islands
(Kurils, Commander Islands, Okhotsk Sea islands, Peter the Great Bay Islands (Japan/East
Sea),
e) application program for biodiversity conservation,
f) productivity forecasts of cultivated marine organisms,
g) vitality assessment of rare and endangered species in the island microrefuges,
h) flora and vegetation of Pacific islands,
i) natural ecological framework for territories,and aquatories,
j) halophytic plants of the Northwest Pacific coast: chromosomes, ecology and protection,
k) taxonomic diversity and relationships in major and important groups of plants in the
Northwest Pacific area,
1) rare plant species in the Russian Far East and their protection,
m) Pacific basin biodiversity protection,
n) plant communities diversity in wildlife areas of the Russian Far East,
o) mathematical methods of comparative study and assessment of biodiversity, and
p) databases of biodiversity components.
Proposals:
a) The biodiversity problem is of a great importance and must be placed among priorities in
the framework of PICES.
b) Coastal ecosystems determine bioproductivity of marine ecosystems, but there is a lack of
information about them, because terrestrial and marine ecosystems have, for a long time,
been investigated separately. We stress that studies on biodiversity of island and coastal
ecosystems are growing in importance.
c) Nature use and nature conservancy problems are the most urgent in coastal ecosystems.
Future actions and recommendations
The participants of the workshop are grateful to PICES for providing the opportunity to
present and discuss their work. Many participants hope consideration will be given to have the
proceedings as the workshop published. The workshop asked for a volunteer group of Russian
scientists (contact person: V. Lobanov) to plan to publish the proceedings, with the
cooperation of PICES Secretariat. The proceeding would be a good supplement to the PICES
Scientific Report No.2, 1995 on the Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio Region, which does not fully
include recent Russian work.
9
As the PICES Scientific Report No. 2 focuses on physical oceanographic items, another report
on biological and fisheries aspects of the Okhotsk Sea region would be desirable. In addition,
translation
of Russian monograph, Hydrometeorological Conditions of the Okhotsk Sea,
Gidrometeoizdatt, St. Petersburg, 1995 the Okhotsk Sea (in press) would be useful for us, and
we hope that the book will be published as soon as possible.
After it is published, we suggest
that PICES support translation into English and publish its English version.
3. Recommendations of the Workshop
a). PICES publish the workshop proceedings. PICES should also take the initiative to publish the
other reports mentioned above.
b). POC should take the lead on research in this region and assists to create relevant international
cooperative studies to solve the urgent problems. POC should hold another more focused
workshop on the Okhotsk Sea Region in the near future.
c). POC should organize a Working Group on the circulation and ventilation of the Japan/East
Sea. The Working Group should further discuss the recommendation items given in the
session D summary above.
d). BIO and/or FIS should focus on the biological and fisheries aspects of the Okhotsk Sea and
adjacent areas, through the medium of a report or workshop.
e). FIS should discuss recommendations proposed in the sessions E, F and G above and take the
appropriate action.
f). The workshop recommends that PICES member countries bordering the Okhotsk Sea facilitate
access to investigators to cooperate on scientific research in the region.
PICES should endorse
and support international research programs such as CREAMS in the Japan/East Sea and the
Soya/La Perouse Project.
g). The workshop recommends that CCCC Implementation Group coordinate an international
cooperative project on the Okhotsk Sea area as one of its key projects.
h). TCODE should consider amassing the data necessary for the special process oriented studies.
Complete data inventories from relevant institutions and individuals need to be identified.
It is
recommended that TCODE takes an initiative to solve these problems.
i). POC should takes the initiative to prepare for publication a complete list of nomenclature of
bays, straits, currents in all languages of PICES member countries.

Seasonal Variability of the Pycnocline in La Perouse Strait
and Aniva Gulf

The properties of the pycnocline reflect a number of processes (i.e., atmosphere-ocean heat
exchange, vertical and horizontal motions, etc.) which influence the water structure (Vinogradov et al.,
1984; Lebedev and Aizatulin, 1984; Ozmidov, 1986; Zyryanov, 1980; Trotsenko et al., 1992).
Investigation of the temporal-spatial pycnocline variability plays an important role for fishery and
ecology of the productive shelf regions within the Far Eastern Marginal Seas.
The most difficult problem in evaluating the pycnocline characteristics is to find the point of
inflection based on discrete density estimations at the standard horizons assuming, in advance,
continuous vertical assignment of the density function r(z). Layer by layer calculations are
unacceptable since such way permits one to define the layer of the maximal density change, but not the
inflection point. In order to eliminate the uncertainty, as a rule, the spline approximation is used
(Ahlberg et al., 1967). This approach allows restoration of the curve of vertical distribution r(z) in
the preliminary searched layer of the maximum density change with the help of a polynomial of the
third order and then to determine the position of the inflection.
An algorithm to define the pycnocline characteristics is given below. Firstly, the layer [z; ,
z;+,J of the maximum density change r(z) was found from discrete experimental data. In the cases
when the maximal change r(z) covered more that one layer their combination was considered as the
layer [z;, z;+,J. Within this layer distribution of r(z) was approximated by the cubic spline:
p(z) = a0z3 + a1z2 + a2z+ a3 (1)
In order to find the coefficients a; (i = 0-3) the following boundary condition have been applied:
P(z)lz=zi = Pi ;
P(z)lz=zi
+1 =

z=zi+1
D i+1 = [P(zi+2) - P(zi+1)l/(Zi+2 - zi+l) ,
zi+1 < H
Lo,
zi+1 = H
As a result the system of four algebraic equations was obtained and solved using the standard
approach.
By equating to zero the second derivative of the function r(z):
d2p/dz2 = 6ap zp + 2a1 = 0, (2)
13
the point of r(z) inflection zp was computed:
zP=-al/3a0.
The first derivative of the function r(z) gives the density gradient. By substituting the
equation (2) in (1), the expression for calculation of the pycnocline intensity at the depth zp i.e., the
maximum vertical density gradient G. in the fixed point was received.

Based on the given algorithm the charts of the maximum vertical density gradients (G,) and
the depths of their location (zp) in spring, summer, and fall have been prepared and used to reveal the
spatial pycnocline structure and its annual transformation in La Perouse Strait and Gulf of Aniva (Fig.
1). The multi-year means of the seasonal density fields, being restored in the nodes of regular net by
the standard graphic packages, have been applied for our calculations.
The charts clearly demonstrate that the pycnocline shape is a result of the water dynamic in the
region. Thus, the Soya Current meandering leads to the vorticity strengthening in the current field and
as a consequence, to the rising or deepening of the pycnocline.. For example, the Soya Current
cyclonic meander south-eastward off the Cape of Krilion is responsible for the pycnocline movement
upward to a depth of 10 in (Fig. la) and an increase of the intensity up to 0.06-0.07 sda/m (specific
density anomaly per meter) (Fig.ld). The Soya current anticyclonic meander in the La Perouse Strait,
on the contrary, forms an intensive downwelling zone where the pycnocline deepens to a depth of 30-
35 in (Fig. ic).
The pycnocline properties are influenced by the intrusion of external water in the region. The
Gulf of Aniva is characterized by the intense river runoff which in summer period causes the increased
persistence of two-layer vertical water stratification and the high (more than 0.1 sda/m) pycnocline
intensity in the upper layer (Fig. le). The sources of external water for the La Perouse Strait are the
streams or mesoscale vortexes of the East-Sakhalin Current (Fig. lb).
The spatial heterogeneity in the depth distribution of the pycnocline location is most vividly
expressed in spring and fall (Fig. la-c). In addition to the dynamic reasons, the spatial heterogenity
could be correspondingly explained by the radiation heating and the fall-winter convection in spring
and fall,. During the transitional seasons, the horizontal field structure of zp is represented by the
14
,
combination of closed isolines considered as the local dynamic formations. Within these formations
the depth of the pycnocline location changes abruptly, and the sharp density variations are observed
similar to those for other regions of the World Ocean, in particular, for the Sea of Scotia (Lebedev and
Aizatulin, 1984) and the Gulf of Aden (Trotsenko et al., 1992).
In the summer period, within the Gulf of Aniva, the large area of sinking waters is formed due
to the prevailing of anticyclonic current. As a result the pycnocline deepens and reaches the depth of
20 in (Fig. lb). The pycnocline rises slightly northward and in the nearshore zone of upwelling it
becomes thin and shows significant gradients (Fig. le).
Significant seasonal variations of the maximum vertical density gradients are revealed in the La
Perouse Strait and Gulf of Aniva. The lowest G,,,,,, values of 0.02-0.05 sda/m are found in spring and
fall (Fig. id, If) and the highest G,,. values of 0.14-0.18 sda/m are displayed in summer (Fig. le).
As a whole, summer is characterised by a more homogeneous distribution of z,, and by the general
increase of G,,. values, approximately by an order. During this season, a decrease of vertical density
gradient location to 15-20 in is also observed everywhere. These essential differences in the vertical
density stratification are related, mainly, to the annual insolation variation and seasonal transformation
of the current fields.
Our results show that the pycnocline within the shelfzone in the La Perouse Strait and Gulf of
Aniva is characterized by the strong seasonal variability with preserved mosaic G. distribution
during all seasons. This is evidence that the area under study is a region with a complex climatic
regime of dynamic and thermohaline water structure formation. In perspective the properties and
interannual
variability of the pycnocline in other regions within the Sakhalin Shelf have to be
evaluated.

Modeling of the Typical Water Circulations in
the La Perouse Strait and Aniva Gulf Region

INTRODUCTION
The Aniva and La Perouse Region is characterized by a quite complex spatial water circulation
structure. It was shown that the circulation patterns are determined by the sea level gradient of the
northern Japan Sea and southwestern Okhotsk Sea parts (Aota, 1970; 1975; 1982; 1988), but there is
not general agreement on the gradient's nature. In some works the supposition has been stated that the
sea level gradient is due to a difference in the sea water density between the Japan and Okhotsk Seas,
whereas other papers considered such factors as atmospheric circulation and tidal currents (Leonov,
1960; Shelegova, 1960).
The Japan Sea water discharge through the La Perouse Strait, under the influence of the sea level
gradient, has essential fluctuations within the range of the interannual, seasonal and synoptic scales.
Data on the diurnal mean transport through the La Perouse Strait are extremely limited. Regarding the
seasonal variability of discharge, it is known (Aota, 1988) that in the warm period (July - October) the
eastward (east or south-east) transport with velocities of about 50-80 cm/sec prevails. In the early
winter, the resulting vector of the flow reverses and has a northwestward direction; at that time the
current velocity, as a rule, does not exceed 10-15 cm/sec.
In the warm period, the diurnal currents are dominant in the Aniva and La Perouse Region, and
the main axis directions for diurnal and semidiurnal currents correspond to the direction of the mean
flow.
In the early winter, the diurnal and semidiurnal currents become significantly weaker (Aota,
1988).
Due to the shallow waters (the maximal depth is about 130-140 m) and the funnel-shaped
configuration of the shoreline in the Aniva and La Perouse areas, the water circulation in this region is
under the great influence of the relatively strong monsoon type local winds. Under some baric
conditions, these winds can transform the sea level gradient and the current structure on the southern
Sakhalin shelf. Therefore, to understand the water circulation variability it is crucial to reveal atypical
characteristics of the background currents resulting from these transformations.
The goal of this paper is to construct the typical water circulation schemes for the La Perouse
and Aniva Region taking into account the different types of the regional baric field applying numerical
modelling. Such an approach was successfully used previously for the Chukchi Sea (Kulakov, 1993).
MODEL DESCRIPTION
An improved version of the 3D diagnostic model (Budaeva et al., 1980) worked out for the
coastal Sakhalin waters was applied to estimate water circulation in the La Perouse Strait and Aniva
Gulf Region.
Diagnostic calculations of water circulation and the three-dimensional field of the
17
currents have been performed for the different regional baric situations (Atlas, 1977;
Atlas, 1979).
The grid used approximated the area with the steps of 10'x12'. The number of grid nodes was 72 and
the maximal calculated level was 125 in. The numerical modeling was conducted in the frames of
linear equations for shallow waters under the condition of free flowing liquid boundaries and a
discharge through the La Perouse Strait. In accordance with the our previous results (Budaeva et al.,
1980) the sea water baroclinity was considered.
RESULTS
Figs. la and lb present schemes of the integral circulation and surface currents corresponding to
the type (I) of the regional baric situation. This type is characterized by the southward winds
(southwestern and southern) that induce a significant sea level elevation in the eastern part of the Aniva
Gulf and a sea level depression along the Okhotsk Sea coast of Hokkaido Island. Under the effect of
the winds water circulation in the La Perouse Strait and Aniva Gulf region becomes anticyclonic and,
as a rule, vertically homogeneous. As a consequence of circulation intensification, an increased inflow
of the relatively warm Japan Sea waters is observed in the western and central parts of the Aniva Gulf
and their transport along the Okhotsk Sea coast of Hokkaido.
The anticyclonic mesoscale eddy
generated in the offshore area of the La Perouse Strait is the major element of such a type of water
circulation. It should be noted that the maximal development of the eddy is found under the influence
of the southwestern winds and within the area of 45°30' and 46°00'N with a transport about 0.3 Sv.
The highest surface current velocities (greater than 50 cm/sec) are revealed at the entrance to
La Perouse Strait near the Capes of Krilion and Aniva and on the northern periphery of the mesoscale
anticyclonic eddy.
A similar type of the water circulation, that could be generally considered as type (I),
is
observed when the western winds prevail (Fig. lc). The only difference from the type (I) is found in
the structure of the surface currents along the Okhotsk Sea coast of Hokkaido where a sea level
.depression is manifested less clearly and the scheme of currents is closer to the climatic circulation.
Figs. Id and le demonstrate schemes of the integral water circulation and surface currents
corresponding to the regional baric situation of the type (II). It is characterized by the northern and
northwestern winds that generate low sea level in the northern shallow part of the Aniva Gulf and a sea
level elevation along the Okhotsk Sea coast of Hokkaido. Changes in water circulation are observed,
mainly, in the formation of the mesoscale cyclonic eddy-meander on the western periphery of the Soya
current and in the water rising in the northern shallow part of the Aniva Gulf. The cyclonic current
active, mainly, in the surface layer (up to 50 m) is observed from the western side of this meander,
whereas a non-persistent anticyclonic current is noted eastward off the main flow. When this type of
regime exists, an increase of compensative near bottom inflow of the transformed Japan Sea waters is
revealed in the central and east part of the Aniva Gulf, from which point, being under the effect of the
eastern and southeastern flows, it follows to the southwestern part of the Okhotsk Sea.
Figs. If - lh illustrate the schemes of the integral circulation and the surface currents associated
with the type (III) of the regional baric situation. This circulation is formed when the northeastern,
eastern and southeastern winds occur and create a "counter current" in the La Perouse Strait for the
eastward transport of the Japan Sea waters. Prevailing winds cause a sea level elevation in the
northern (southeastern winds) or western (northeastern and eastern winds) parts of the La Perouse
Strait and Aniva Gulf region. This decreases the sea level gradient between the Japan and Okhotsk
Seas and can even change the sign of the gradient in the La Perouse Strait and favor the western flow
in the Strait. In this case the currents has a vividly pronounced two-layer vertical structure.
In the
surface layer (above 15-20 m) the main current flows westward/southwestward and, as a result, the
18
Soya current is blocked along the Okhotsk Sea coast of the Hokkaido. According to our estimations
the maximum velocities at the surface can reach 50-80 cm/sec in the La Perouse Strait, and 20-30
cm/sec in the Aniva Gulf. The current has the right rotation but at the depth of 25-30 in it reverses,
and the velocities observed are 2-4 times lower as compared with the surface velocities. The water
circulation, corresponding to the type (III) of the regional baric situation, has the most anomalous
character and leads to non-regular intraseasonal disturbances of the hydrological water structure along
the southwestern coast of Sakhalin Island (Shelegova, 1960).
The model calculations show that in the La Perouse Strait and Aniva Gulf region the current
fields are essentially dynamic and demonstrate the strong dependence on the type of regional baric
situation. In such cases the current structure has a number of peculiarities. Generally, during
prevailing northeastern, northern or eastern, northwestern (southeastern) winds the two-layer vertical
structure of currents is found and with southwestern, western (southern) winds it has, mostly, one
direction. The major activity of the mesoscale cyclonic eddies is observed when the persistent types III
(eastern,, northeastern and southeastern winds) and II (northern and northwestern winds) of the
regional baric situation occur, and the anticyclonic eddy exists under the influence of the southern
southwestern and western winds (the baric situation of type I).
The proposed method of standardization and dialogue computer program for the typical
circulation calculations generated by the wind in the La Perouse Strait and Aniva Gulf region are
useful for the diagnostic aims of the present climate and providing the navigation service with the
available information.

Anticyclogenesis over the Okhotsk Sea and its Influence on Weather
Nina A. DASHKO', Sergey M. VARLAMOV2,

The anticyclonic activity over the Far Eastern Seas is one of the reasons for the weather
anomalies over the adjacent territories. The anticyclogenesis
over the Okhotsk Sea, most developed in
May-July, contributes significantly to the synoptic processes in summer. In the years of active
anticyclogenesis the air temperature over Primorye, Sakhalin and the Western Kamchatka coast is
mostly below normal.
Precipitations over Sakhalin and Kamchatka are also below normal, whereas
over Primorye, on the contrary, they are above average.
At the beginning of summer, especially at the end of May and June, the intensification of the
anticyclone occurs over the Okhotsk Ridge and
moves towards the Japan Sea, across the periphery to
the south of Primorye. The maritime air mass
appearance is accompanied by the southern or south-
eastern winds reaching sometimes about 15-20 m/sec, as well as by rain, drizzle or fogs. Such
situations can continue for 5-7 days and lead to a decrease of the daily mean air temperature in
Vladivostok up to 9-10°C, while the daily
mean air temperatures in June from the multi-year
observations is 12.8°C (Manual of the Short-term.., 1965; Dashko and Teslenko, 1991).
June in South Primorye is a transition period from spring to
summer, and thus, a month of
weather contrasts.
It is a central month in the first half of the summer monsoon which provides the
coast of Primorye with a continuous drizzle, thick fogs and strong, primarily, southern winds (Manual
of the Long-term.., 1968; Dashko and Teslenko, 1991).
Fig. 1 demonstrates that the temperature regime in June in Vladivostok is distinctly different
from the temperature regime of Nice and Rome located at the same latitude. The monthly mean air
temperature in Vladivostok from April till July is the same as in Stockholm situated at 59°N (Fig. 1).
The duration of day light increases from 14 hours 32 minutes in May to 15 hours 12 minutes
in June. The duration of sun radiance,
on the contrary, decreases from 170 hours in May to 130 hours
in June, on average. The ratio of the actual to the possible
sun radiance duration is 41 % in May and
only 32 % in June.
The monthly mean temperature in June is 12-13°C. This is slightly lower than in September
and can be compared with the mean air temperature in the first half of October. The air temperature
shows significant variations during the month: the minimal
temperature of 4.4°C and the maximal of
32°C were recorded (Soviet Union's Climatic Reference Book, 1966-1970).
It should be noted that
moving off the coast, the continental climatic features prevail and June becomes
the typical warm
summer month.
The comparison of the summer weather characteristics
over the Primorye edge of Russia and
Korean Peninsula, based on a 50
year data set from observations at meteorological stations,
demonstrated that the air temperature field distribution depends,
to a great extent, on the circulation
peculiarities and thermal state of the Okhotsk Sea.
21
For more detailed analysis, the correlation matrices were constructed for
the monthly mean air
temperature at stations of Primorye and Korean Peninsula and the
monthly mean meteorological
parameters (pressure, air temperature, surface geopotential at 500 gPa), their derivatives
(OS
/ ax, OS / r9y, 02S / axdy, a2S /
dx2,
a2S / oy2
) and Laplacians AS at 30 points over the Okhotsk
Sea and adjacent regions.
The correlation coefficients of 0.7 were found between the monthly mean
air temperature and air pressure over the Okhotsk Sea and the monthly mean air temperature
at stations
of Primorye and Korean Peninsula (Fig. 2). The significant correlation coefficients were
also revealed
between the monthly mean air temperature and the first oS / 0y
and second
8S / 032 derivatives, and
Laplacians for the air pressure field at sea level (P0)
and the geopotential at standard pressure level 500
mbar and their relative topography (Fig. 3).
The cold subsurface (dichothermal)
layer of the Okhotsk Sea creates the favorable conditions
for the intensification and stability of the anticyclonic atmospheric fields in the
region. On climatic
maps for the summer months (from the beginning of May and
sometimes even from the end of April)
the pressure fields over the Okhotsk Sea are revealed as the ridge of the North
Pacific anticyclone.
The permanent North Pacific (Honolulu, Hawaii)
anticyclone is an enormous high warm baric
formation developed over the warm oceanic surface within the high pressure
band of the Pacific
subtropical and tropical zones (20-40°N) with a center located to the north of the
Hawaiian Islands.
The appearance of the North Pacific anticyclone results from dynamic factors
and is supported by
migration of Arctic and Asiatic continent anticyclones into the system.
The summer thermal conditions over the oceanic surface lead to the ridge
propagation from the
source towards the Far Eastern Seas, in particular, to the Okhotsk Sea.
Under the favorable
tropospheric thermodynamic conditions in the Maritime Polar Air Mass over
the Okhotsk Sea the
original anticyclone generates a cold baric formation with the relatively low height
extension.
Generally, from May till July, in the period of the most intensive
anticyclogenesis,
the high
pressure fields over the Okhotsk Sea were observed from 27 up to
60 days or, on average, in a half of
all cases (47%) with an increase in June up to 55%
(Table 1). The ridge was detected two times
more
often than the anticyclone centre.
The essential variations in the yearly mean distribution of the
high
pressure fields over the Okhotsk Sea were revealed. For example,
in June the ridge or anticyclone
centre was fixed from 6 up to 24 days.
The summary duration of the whereabouts over the Sea was
10-14 days for the anticyclone and 15-19 days for the ridge.
The lowest air temperatures were recorded in the period of the most intensive
anticyclogenesis.
A weakening of the anticyclone induced an enhancement of the air temperature
in Vladivostok,
Magadan and at other stations.
The same conclusions were made based on the analysis of the air temperature
variations at the
station of the Korean Peninsula (Pyongyang and Seoul) (Fig. 4).
Thus, the Okhotsk maritime anticyclogenesis is a result of the atmospheric processes not over
the temperate zone but their interaction with the ocean and the processes over the
Tropical and Arctic
zones in the Northern Hemisphere.
The role of the anticyclonic activity in the Far Eastern
weather
formation is not doubted and complex.

Research of Water Structure and Dynamics in the Okhotsk Sea
and Adjacent Pacific
Boris S. DYAKOV, Alexander A. NIKITIN and Vadim P. PAVLYCHEV
Pacific Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (TINRO-centre)
Vladivostok, Russia.
Water structure and dynamics of the Okhotsk Sea and adjacent Pacific have been studied based on
satellite information and CTD data from the section carried out aboard the R/VAcademik Nesmeyanov in
September 3-12 1993. Spatial variability of geostrophic currents and hydrological conditions in the layer
of 1,000 in have been investigated. It was established that the most complex dynamic zone was situated
near the Kuril Islands.
The international expedition organized by the Pacific Oceanological Institute (Vladivostok,
Russia) and the Institute of Ocean Sciences (Sidney, Canada) was performed in September 3-12 of 1993
aboard the R/V Academik Alexander Nesmeyanov. The oceanographic section along the WOCE P1W
line has been carried out. A total of 30 stations, separated nominally by 30 nautical miles, were occupied..
The section started in the Pacific at 44°00'N and 153°30'E and ended on the northern Okhotsk shelf at
58°30N and 141°48'E. On the way section passed through the Bussol Strait and crossed the basin and
the shelf region of the Okhotsk Sea. A total length of the section was 870 miles (Fig. 1).
CTD data from this section and satellite information were used to investigated the water structure
and dynamics of the Okhotsk Sea and adjacent Pacific. Velocities and volume transport of the geostrophic
currents in the layer of 1,000 m were calculated applying the standard procedure (Zubov, 1979).
In September the cyclonic activity in the Okhotsk Sea and adjacent are of the Pacific strengthed.
Also, the intrusion of water from the Pacific through the Bussol and Fourth Kuril Straits in the Okhotsk
Sea increased (Luchin and Darnitsky, 1993; Luchin, 1987). Satellite images indicated the complex
horizontal water structure near the Kuril Islands and on the northwestern shelf of the Sea (Fig. 1). The
main features of this structure are: thermal front, currents, eddies of different scales and rotations
(cyclonic and anticyclonic). Within the Kuril Islands area the intrastructure of the Kuril front and seasonal
and synoptical secondary fronts have been revealed (Gladyshev, 1994). The cold Kuril current was
observed along the Kuril Islands, and the warm Soya current was detected near the northern coast of
Hokkaido. Six anticyclonic eddies were found in the region, five (Al-AS) in the Okhotsk Sea and one (A6)
in the Pacific. The transverse streamers branched from topographical upwelling near the Central Kuril
Islands (Darnitsky and Bulatov, 1995). The formation of Okhotsk sea eddies and streamers is a result of
the interaction of large-scale tidal currents with the bottom topography (Gladyshev, 1994; Darnitsky and
Bulatov, 1995).
The anticyclonic eddy A6 was found to the southeast from the Bussol Strait at 45°00N and
152°00'E. The eddy was not stationary but was a type of eddy usually observed in the area of current
convergence or divergence (Bulatov and Lobanov, 1983). The main formation mechanism of this eddy is
the displacement of currents (Ginzburg, 1992). At the same time Lobanov (1993) considered all Kuril
anticyclones as old Kuroshio rings. He suggested that in result of water transformation the warm core of
these rings was destroyed and the cold core was formed.
29
The oceanographic section crossed the northeastern periphery of the eddy A6 (Fig. 1). In the
layer
of 50-350 in (stations 1-5) the cold water core with temperature less than 2°C was found (Fig.
2). During
the survey more eddies were established in the Okhotsk Sea as compared with the adjacent
Pacific, similar
to that was observed in 1991 and 1994 (Darnitsky and Bulatov, 1995). Eddy
formation is connected to
general water circulation of the Okhotsk Sea and the water exchange between the Sea and
the Pacific
(Gladyshev, 1994).
Analysis of the satellite information demonstrated the entry of the Pacific waters
through the Bussol Strait in the Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 1).
Some structural zones were revealed on the section "Pacific Ocean-Okhotsk Sea".
The most
complex dynamic zone was situated near the Kuril Islands. The cold Kuril current of 100 miles
width
moved along Simushir Island (Fig. 3). In the center of this current (20-300 m) geostrophic velocity was
18.0-19.8 cm/s. The discharge of the Kuril current ws equal to 10.2 x 106 m3/s (near normal), but
in July
1993 the discharge was 6x 106 m3/s.
The speed on the periphery of the eddy A6 was 5.2-8.9 cm/s and increased to the center to
12.8-
15.9 cm/s (Fig. 3). The diameter of eddy A6 was equal to about 70 miles and the discharge changed
from
6.8 up to 8.4 x 106 m3/s which compared with the intensity of the Kuril current. The Kuril current
and
anticyclone A6 spreaded approximately up to 700 in (depth of speed isoline of 5 cm/s).
To the northwest from the Kuril current the Northeastern current (stations 8-12) of 140 miles
width
and speed in the center 6.3-7.5 cm/s was traced (Fig. 3). The discharge of this flow was 7x 10
6 m3/s and
water temperature in the upper layer of 20 in was 10-12°C (Fig. 2).
In central deep water part of the
Okhotsk Sea a calm halistatical zone was found where the current velocity of different directions
did not
exceed 2.5 cm/s in the upper 50 m layer and the volume transport in the layer of 1,000 m between
separate stations fluctuated from 0.1 to 0.7x 106 m3/s. Water temperature of the upper
homogeneous 20
m layer was 12°C (Fig.2).
The increase in the current velocity to 5.5-11.7 cm/s is observed in the north near the continental
slope and at Iona Island (Fig. 1). Close to the southwestern part of the Kashevarova bank
(stations 23-25)
the cyclonic rotation with speeds 9.1-11.7 cm/s was found. The eddy led to the powerful
upwelling of the
intermediate waters (Chernavsky et al., 1993) (Fig. 2). Near the northwestern shores of the Okhotsk
Sea,
the Northern Okhotsk current to the west had a speed of 4.5 cm/s (Fig. 1). The more southern current
with
speed 5.5 cm/s was opposite in direction (Northern Okhotsk counter current). These two currents
formed
the cyclonic gyre.
The oceanographic section crossed the region of the subarctic hydrological water masses.
Typical
T, S curves of a variety of subarctic water structures are presented in Fig. 4.
For example, T, S curve
from station 3 was characteristic for waters from the Pacific (Pacific variety). The region near
the Kuril
Islands was characterized by T, S curves from stations 6,7,9 (Kuril variety). The subarctic
hydrological
structure of the deep water part of the Okhotsk Sea was reflected on T, S curves from
stations 12, 16, 20,
2, 24. The water structure on the Okhotsk sea shelf was presented by T, S curves from stations
26, 28, 30.

INTRODUCTION
In the fall of 1993 an opportunity arose to conduct a CTD
and hydrographic survey along a
line of stations through the Okhotsk Sea.. This line of observations was
conducted to WOCE (World
Ocean Circulation Experiment) specifications for the accuracy of sampling
and the nominal spacing (30
nautical miles) of stations. The observations were acquired as a joint
project involving scientists from
Canada and Russia to execute the westernmost leg of the WOCE
line P1, hereinafter referred to as
P1W, from the research vessel Akademik Nesmeyanov operated by the
Pacific Oceanological Institute
in Vladivostok, Russia.
Fig. 1 displays a map of the station locations. A total of 35
stations were occupied to the
bottom or 3,500 metres, whichever is shallower.
However, for the purposes of this paper only the
first 30 stations will be discussed as they included all variables sampled
and specifically constitutes the
line of observations known as P1W. These are the stations identified
with triangles and circles on
Fig. 1.
It is well known (Talley, 1991) that the salinity distribution in
the top 1,000 metres of the N.E.
Pacific is dominated by a salinity minimum tongue.
The salinity minimum dominates the salinity
distribution between latitudes 45°N to 25°N and is still detectable as
far south as 10°N. Talley (1991)
reviews some of the history concerning speculation about the possible
origin of the NPIW, and some of
that material bears repeating here. The Okhotsk Sea does have
lower salinity (33.45 psu) and higher
oxygen (170 µM/kg) at ae = 26.8 than is encountered
in the North Pacific.
Typical values along the
165°W section presented in Fig. 2 being 34 psu and 120 µM/kg,
respectively.
Furthermore, the
density of water at the sill in the Bussol' Strait is high (ae = 27.7)
suggesting that it could be a source
of dense water in the North Pacific. These ideas were pursued by Wiist
(1930) who concluded, based
on very little information, that the Okhotsk Sea
likely was the source of NPIW. Reid (1965,
1973)
concluded otherwise. In particular, Reid felt that the Okhotsk Sea
could never supply the volume of
water required.
Favorite et al (1976) disagreed with Reid and actually attributed
the sources of both
the Oyashio and the East Kamchatka Currents to water formed
within the Okhotsk Sea. Kitani (1973)
suggested that water mass modification on the Okhotsk Sea shelf
could produce water at densities up to
27.05 ae which might subsequently flow into the northwest Pacific.
Finally, Talley (1991) concurs
with the opinions of Kitani, though is unable to estimate the volume
of NPIW that might be formed
within the Okhotsk Sea. This paper will demonstrate evidence in support
of Kitani's conjecture.
In this paper we will present results from a single section
completed from the open Pacific,
through the Bussol' Strait and continuing through the Sea of Okhotsk to
the coast of Siberia. The data
will be described in section 2 and discussion of the implications for the
formation of the NPIW mass
will be presented in section 3. We will conclude that we have observed
the Okhotsk Sea component of
36
the NPIW water, but that only part of that water mass is formed by direct ventilation from surface
processes.
DATA DESCRIPTION
The observations discussed in this paper were completed as part of the cruise designated P1W
(western leg of line P1) by the WOCE Hydrographic Program office, 9316 by the Institute of Ocean
Sciences (which took a major part in the program), and AN25 by the Pacific Oceanological Institute,
Vladivostok, which operates the vessel, the RN Akademik A. Nesmeyanov. In all that follows it will
be cited by the WOCE designation, PIW. This survey was a joint endeavour completed by scientists
from the Institute of Ocean Sciences (Canada), the Pacific Oceanological Institute (Russia) and the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (U.S.A.). The cruise began on the 30' August and was
completed on the 21' September, 1993. The Woods Hole interest was in sedimentary processes within
the Okhotsk Sea, and none of those observations will be presented or discussed here.
Fig. 2 displays profiles of the primary variables. The indicated bottom is determined from the
bottom of each CTD cast.
This is reliable as a bottom determination as the CTD was lowered to
within a few tens of metres of the bottom with the aid of a pinger suspended below the rosette sampler.
Potential temperature and density are computed relative to the surface. A notable feature is the
presence of two lenses of very cold water lying entirely within the Okhotsk Sea. The dichothermal
layer, centred at a depth of about 100 metres was contoured in the open water between stations 13 and
24 (Fig. 2a).
It is characterized by low salinities 33.0-33.2 psu (Fig. 2b) and densities 26.4-26.6 ae
(Fig. 2c) and is supersaturated (up to 360 µmol/kg) by oxygen (Fig. 2d). The latter indicates that
winter convection reaches to the depth of the dichothermal layer and that surface heating covers the
layer in summer. Temperatures within this sub-zero water mass are as low as -1.1 °C near station 20
and represents the temperature of the winter surface mixed layer (Moroshkin, 1966; Talley and
Nagata, 1995).
The "saline" (about 33.48 psu) water with temperature near the freezing point
(-1.71 °C), density of 26.85-26.90 ae and oxygen concentration of 250-260 p.mol/kg was found just
above the bottom on the northwestern shelf on stations 28 and 29 (Figs. 2a-d). This is the so-called
Kitani Water originated due to brine rejection during active sea-ice formation (Kitani, 1973; Alfultis
and Martin, 1987).
We should also mention that in the temperature field there is evident of a
discontinuity in properties on opposite sides of the Bussol' Sill. This could suggest either that
exchange between the Okhotsk Sea and the open Pacific is restricted at depths from 1,000 in to as
shallow as 100 metres, or that the area of the Bussol' Strait is a region where water masses are being
modified rapidly, perhaps by tidal mixing.
The potential density structure through the Bussol' Strait and into the Pacific Ocean is
interesting (Fig. 2c). Isopycnals at all depths shoal as they are followed from the Okhotsk Sea towards
the Pacific. Between stations 5 and 3 they then deepen and then rise between stations 3 and 1. This
indicates the presence of a very energetic eddy. In fact there are persistent reports of the presence of a
semi-permanent anticyclonic eddy directly outside the Bussol' Strait, and has been named 'The Bussol
Eddy' by Russian Scientists.
Descriptions of the Bussol' Eddy can be found in papers by: Saitoh,
Kosaka and lisaka (1986);
Rogachev and Goryachev (1991) and Rogachev et al (1995). Over the
central Okhotsk Sea a general doming of isopycnals is evident, suggestive of a general cyclonic
circulation pattern. All of these features are also reflected in the salinity distributions shown in Fig. 2.
Between stations 11 and 24 contours of all variables are fairly flat, suggesting little dynamics taking
place at the time of the survey.
A doming of isopycnals near station 24 may be indicative of a
recirculation over the Kashevarov Bank which was close to line PIW.
37
The dissolved oxygen concentrations in the deep water within the Kuril
Basin are more
homogeneous than those at similar depths in the open Pacific (Fig. 2d). Oxygen
levels throughout the
Kuril Basin are similar to values in the Pacific at sill depth.
This fits the distribution of other
properties, where in all cases the profiles below sill depth inside the Kuril Basin are
different from
those outside. This suggests that some exchange is occurring in the very deep waters
replacing water
in the Kuril Basin. But we see little evidence of exchange at other depths. We will return to
this point
in more detail later in the paper. We see a water mass at the bottom of the Deryugin
Basin which is
very low in dissolved oxygen, and is also (see Fig. 2) extremely
rich in dissolved silicate. This has all
of the marks of a very old water mass that is rarely replaced and so sets this basin apart
from the Kuril
Basin. Water this low in dissolved oxygen is actually found at stations 1 to 4 outside
of the Okhotsk
Sea where the dissolved oxygen profiles show typical for the northern N.
Pacific minimum near a
depth of 1,000 metres. However, there can never have been any actual connection
between these two
water masses as the dissolved silicates are substantially different
The distributions of the nutrients, reveal patterns that are largely reflected
in the other,
dynamic variables.
The notable exception being the presence of very high silicate
levels within the
Deryugin Basin.
The absence of extremely high silicate levels near the bottom of the
Kuril Basin
suggests that water within that basin is freely exchanged with water
in the open north Pacific.
The
other nutrients (phosphate and nitrate) do not show elevated values in the
Deryugin Basin.
Fig. 3 demonstrates details of the potential density distribution around the sill
in the Bussol'
Strait computed from data at the first 11 stations (shown by the triangle symbols
of Fig. 1). This
clearly shows that water at a depth of 3,000 metres near the bottom of the
Kuril Basin can be
exchanged freely with water at a depth of only 2,000 metres in the open Pacific.
Examination of other
properties indicate that these waters have identical silicate and oxygen profiles,
and we will see later
that these also have identical 0-S relationships. We presume, therefore,
that the properties of the
seawater in the open Pacific at 2,000 metres and near bottom in the Kuril Basin are
identical, and that
deep water is freely exchanged across the Bussol' Sill.
Indeed, it appears from Fig. 3 that the survey
actually caught a deep water replacement event in the act, so to speak.
The density structure shown in Fig. 3 suggests that the Bussol' Eddy penetrates very
deeply.
If the eddy intensifies its circulation then the dip in deep isopycnals centred on station
#3 must become
more pronounced and either isopycnals will rise at stations 1 and
5, or fall at station 3, or both. This
suggests that the density of water appearing at the Bussol' Sill
from the Pacific Ocean may be
determined by the strength of the eddy.
In other words, the probability of a deep water replacement
event in the Kuril Basin may well be pre-conditioned, or possibly even
determined, by the strength of
the Bussol' Eddy.
NORTH PACIFIC INTERMEDIATE WATER
Fig. 4 shows 0-S curves for all data collected along the major line of 30 stations
indicated in
Fig. 1. At the far right of the diagram all curves converge to a single water mass.
This is expected
from the detailed structure around the Bussol' Sill shown in Fig. 3. The
0-S curves separate into two
distinct curves in the ag range of 26.9 to 27.3. The upper branch contains
0-S curves from stations 1
to 5, inclusive, i.e., stations from the open Pacific to the sill in the
Bussol' Strait, but no further. The
lower branch contains profiles from all the other stations 6 to 30 within the Okhotsk
Sea.
A region of 0-S space has been marked with a square.
This identifies the profiles that are
typical of the Okhotsk Sea, but having 0-S properties (at the same sigma-theta
values) distinctly
different from water in the open Pacific.
Ohtani (1989) identifies this water as the Sea of Okhotsk
38
component of the North Pacific Intermediate Water mass (NPIW), and Watanabe et al (1991) agree
with this conclusion. In the remainder of this paper we will refer to the Sea of Okhotsk component of
NPIW as Sea of Okhotsk Intermediate Water, or SOIW. Let us assign an SOIW concentration of 1.0
to the 0-S values that occupy the centre of that rectangle. Allow this concentration to fall linearly to
zero at the boundary of the box, and remain zero for any 0-S value outside of the box. We can then
search the distributions of 0 and S and use this concentration to examine the spatial distribution of the
SOIW which is illustrated in Fig. 5. The highest concentrations of this water mass occur between
depths of 700 to 800 metres. The water does not penetrate to the bottom in the deepest part of the
Deryugin Basin and appears to be cut off very abruptly in the approaches to the Bussol' Strait. We see
no evidence of exchange of water through the Bussol' Strait within this water mass. The dashed line
superimposed on the contour chart is the path of the contour ae = 27.05, discussed above. This, as
expected, delineates the upper surface of the SOIW distribution.
If a water mass is formed at the surface and then ventilates a deeper basin, then some
properties of this water mass will be carried from the surface and maintained. McDowell et al (1982)
point out that for quasi-geostrophic ocean dynamics the horizontal velocity is nearly non-divergent and
so at scales larger than the Rossby radius of deformation the relative vorticity is much smaller than the
stretching term and so potential vorticity can be estimated from hydrographic measurements alone as:-
- fap
q
poaz
The quantity q is conserved as water sinks below the surface and has been used by Talley and
McCartney (1982) to track the penetration of Labrador Sea Water into the deep waters of the north
Atlantic by tracking the locations of a tongue of potential vorticity minimum. A ventilated water mass
will show up as a minimum in q because a convectively renewed water mass should show excessive
vertical homogeneity relative to the water above and below it.
The potential vorticity q is presented on Fig. 6. The contour interval is variable because q
has a very large dynamic range. In this plot we have shaded the region of q less than 100 x 10" and
greater than 50 x 10" cm's'. Also, the bold dashed lines show ae values of 26.85 and 27.05. The
potential vorticity at stations 1 through 4 (in the open Pacific) decreases monotonically from the
surface to the deep water and so show no evidence of any recent ventilation.
However, the vorticity
separates the water masses within the Okhotsk Sea into 4 distinct regions. Starting from the top we
find the high potential vorticity region, above 200 metres. Extending from 200 m to a depth of
perhaps 450 m we find a region of low potential vorticity. The line co = 26.85 lies down the centre of
this potential vorticity minimum. Below this value of aethe potential vorticity increases to a maximum
value at a mean ae of 27.05 (region 3) and thereafter decreases steadily to the bottom (region 4). This
diagram suggests that a recent convection event has occurred that has ventilated the Okhotsk Sea at a
mean density of ae = 26.85. The region of ventilation extends to greater densities, perhaps as great as
ae = 27.05, the maximum density possible indicated by Kitani, but certainly no deeper. Thus we have
observed ventilation of the Okhotsk Sea essentially to the top surface of the water mass identified as
the SOIW, and possibly a short distance into that water mass.
DISCUSSION
What this paper has shown is that if the water mass identified here, and by others, as the
SOIW then we have a problem. The calculations of Kitani and the observations here indicate that only
39
the upper levels of this water mass are ventilated.
If we are to move some of this water to higher
densities then it is necessary to invoke some form of mixing process that will move water properties
selectively downwards.
Talley (private communication) has suggested that cabelling might be a
significant process. Certainly, if two water masses of equal density are mixed, then cabelling will
always increase the density of the mixture so leading to steady sinking. However, the density changes
that can be effected by cabelling are rather small compared with the increases of density that we
require here, of order 0.2 to 0.3 a9units.
Another possibility might be mixing by bottom generated
turbulence originating from the very strong tidal flows known to run through the Bussol' Strait. We
recommend that the Okhotsk Sea should be subjected to much greater scrutiny than has hitherto been
the case. In particular future surveys should have as one object a determination of the role of sub-
thermocline mixing processes and the role that these may play in the determination of the properties of
the Okhotsk component of the North Pacific Intermediate Water mass.

1. INTRODUCTION
Geophysical satellite monitoring of the environment becomes a necessary tool for investigation
the of seas and atmosphere, especially for such a hard-to-research area as the Okhotsk Sea. It seems
that the most interesting results in studies of variable natural objects could be obtained by combining
satellite and in-situ data. Using the regular satellite information, it is possible to control the in-situ
data acquisition according to location and development of the object investigated, and thus to increase
the productivity and cost-effectiveness of marine expeditions. These are the considerations that
determine the direction of our work as well as the objects of interest and methods of data processing.
At present moment, we are developing the technology that may be specified as Regional Environmental
Satellite Monitoring (RESM). The technology includes:
regular capture of high-resolution multi-channel satellite data,
extracting of geophysical parameters from the data,
reconstruction of geophysical fields,
location and tracing of natural and human-made objects and phenomena at sea surface and
atmosphere (eddies, cyclones, frontal zones, currents and its meanders, ice fields, pollution, etc.),
evaluation of spatial and temporal variability of the fields, objects and phenomena.
Because of high variability of our objects, the data processing should be performed in the
quasi-real-time mode and the results should be transmitted to the vessel immediately.
Since 1993, we performed the RESM support for several cruises in the Japan and Okhotsk
Seas. The following paragraphs are brief description of our RESM Data System, technology and
methods we used, as well as some problems we have met.
2. THE RESM DATA SYSTEM: GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The RESM technology is based on daily capture and processing of data transmitted by
meteorological NOAA (HRPT mode) and GMS (digitized LRFAX mode) satellites.
To achieve the goal, the Data System consisting of a 1.7 GHz Receiving Ground Station and
local network of five IBM PC compatible computers was built. One of the computers executes a data
receiving and antenna control functions; another one (the most powerful) is proposed for the data
processing and packing. The rest of the computers are used for both data processing and software
development. Being located in Vladivostok our System covers a wide area: from 17 to 62°N and up
to 160°E. This area includes the Okhotsk, Japan, Yellow and East China Seas, and some areas of
Western Pacific.
45
At the moment a major part of our work is dealing with sea surface temperature (SST)
fields,
thermal structures (SSTS), currents (SSC), and ice location and movement. For the last two
objects,
as well as to provide the fine cloudy filtering and atmosphere
correction, both the single images and
their series are processed.
In the nearest future we plan to work with some atmosphere phenomena,
especially typhoons. To research these objects, the System should be upgraded to receive the
S-VISSR
data from the new geostationary satellite GMS-5.
Main RESM output products include:
a. calibrated IR images, transformed into Mercator projection, both instantaneous and
composed (in
the last case a cloudy filtering may be performed);
b.
SST charts and/or grid information of various resolutions, both instantaneous and composed;
c. SSTS charts;
d. charts of ice cover margins and ice movement;
e. surface current vectors and circulation maps.
3. THE RESM SUPPORT OF MARITIME STUDIES
It is extremely importance to obtain the information regularly during marine
expeditions. As a
rule, our support was carrying out according to the following scheme:
day-to-day receipt and pre-processing of the NOAA/HRPT data (2-3 satellites, 4-6 times a day);
packing the raw and pre-processed data onto a streamer tape;
processing of the data as described above;
making of the 5-10 day composed SST, SSTS, and SSC charts;
transmitting of the charts to the expedition vessels by radio-facsimile channel;
post-expedition processing of the data collected.
This approach has been used already to support five scientific and fishing
cruises to the
Okhotsk and Japan Seas.
Apart from the evident advantages, this way has some serious limitation, such as:
the impossibility of supporting expeditions outside the area covered (e.g.,
in the central part of the
Bering Sea);
low noise-immunity of the radio-channel used does not allow recognition of small
details on the
charts;
low channel capacity hinders transmission of such informative products as images;
the time of satellite information transmission from the coastal System to a
vessel is relatively long,
so efficiency may be lost.
But the most significant limitation is that researchers do not have immediate access
to the data
processing system. As a result, they cannot control (or specify) the satellite data processing
according
to their observations or changed needs. On the other hand, the absence
of in-situ information during
the satellite data handling decreases the quality of RESM products.
Installation of the RESM System onboard the research vessel eliminates all
the difficulties
providing the best combination of remote and in-situ observations.
This was done aboard the
SHIRASE (Japan) and POLARSTERN (Germany) research vessels in the mid-80's.
We have a similar
experience, where our first RESM System was installed onboard the r/v
AKADEMIK KOROLEV and
took part in several cruises in 1988-1990 (Herbeck et al., 1992). Of course, it was a very
difficult and
expensive device at that time, because of the high cost of satellite ground stations
and due to the
46
necessity of placing the antenna drive onto a gyro-stabalized platform. But at the present time, both
stations and computers have become reasonably priced. Besides, due to the increase of computer
capacity it is possible to compensate the vessel motion by using a computer controlled antenna drive
over a wide range.
4. THE DATA PROCESSING
Several details and problems of satellite data processing we have met during the RESM support
of cruises mentioned above are briefly discussed here.
4.1. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Fields
Within the framework of our SST field retrieval technology (Goncharenko and Kazansky,
1992) the main output products are SST charts which might be classified according to time-averaging
as follows:
type A: averaged SST charts over a period of 5-10 days and 50-100 km resolution (Fig. la);
t We B: composite charts of 2-3 days / 10-20 km averaging (Fig. lb);
We C: high resolution charts of 5 km averaging from a single image (Fig. ic).
In addition SST fields are presented as cartographic Mercator projections of 1 km resolution.
These products of digital processing are single images under cloud-free conditions or composite images
under partially cloudy conditions (Fig. id). The data may be presented both as a picture and as digital
grid field information.
A major problem in using satellite measurements for ocean flow visualization is cloud cover.
During an expedition, only a few of images can yield usable data (cloud-free images). The Okhotsk
Sea region has the most cloudy conditions for satellite surveying. Therefore, it is necessary to make a
average or composite map to represent the full SST distribution over the Japan or Okhotsk Seas.
It should be mentioned that SST type A fields are used for hierarchical control while products
(B) and (C) are processed. (A) is successfully applied to fine cloud filtering of every individual image
from the sequence and to normalize images for (B) composition.
The last procedure is required to
avoid artificial defects associated with errors from an atmospheric correction and false thermal front
appearances.
The operative linear atmospheric correction MCSST recommended by NOAA/NESDIS for
NOAA-1 1/12/14 satellites was used to make a preliminary SST retrieval. The technique provided an
accuracy for SST determination of about 0.5°C.
Corrected measurements were filtered to detect
obvious cloudy elements and averaged inside 50 km squares to obtain a preliminary SST field (A).
Both filtration and correction procedures were based only on satellite data from AVHRR channels 2
(0.9 mkm), 4 (11 mkm) and 5 (12 mkm) without any in-situ measurements. The SST field provided
test temperature values when the time sequence of all infra-red images was iteratively filtered to
eliminate residual cloud contamination. To retrieve the field (B), relevant images must be additionally
normalized by (A) and averaged inside 10 km squares. Hence, temperature values of (B) depend on the
time-overlapped `climatic' field (A). Note, that the accuracy of SST determination is not a limiting
factor when a spatially detailed picture is required.
It is advisable to provide the maximal spatial resolution for a SST map obtained from a single
image, so AVHRR data were corrected and averaged inside 5 km squares. To retrieve surface current
fields from satellite data, the navigated images from the AVHRR band of 10.8 mkm were used. To
avoid noise, these images were not corrected pixel-by-pixel.
47
Fig. 2 illustrates the results of applying of our cloudy filtering technique.
There were very
hard cloudy conditions as one can see from the images Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b. After the
processing of a
7-days imagery sequence, the composed SST fields have been built (Fig. 2c)
which are in a good
agreement with the momentary SST fields (Fig. 2d) obtained through
4 days (when cloudiness is
dissipated).
4.2. Sea Surface Velocity
4.2.1. Methods And Their Accuracy
Two methods were applied to prepare the sea surface velocities charts:
feature tracing on sequential satellite images (FT);
maximum cross-correlation technique (MCC) .
The FT procedure was based on a displacement estimation of water
submesoscale
inhomogeneity (AX) and velocity vector calculation (V):
V=AX/11T,
where AT is time interval between two images. The positions of an object are pointed out
manually.
The MCC is an automatic method for velocity estimation.
The essence of the method is the
identification of the maximum cross correlation between search (second image) and
template (first
image) windows, as the end points of displacement vectors from the window center.
Statistical
significance of the cross-correlation maxima was used to refuse vectors with a
low level of
significance.
Instrumental accuracy of velocity estimation was in the range of 2-6 cm/c.
It depended on
space resolution of satellite images and time interval AT. The
final accuracy was usually achieved by
comparison with another kind of velocity measurements, as a rule with
in-situ ones.
It should be mentioned that in-situ
and satellite velocity measurements have different
mining.
The first are measurements at specific points, while a tracing feature on a satellite
image has spatial
size of tens to hundreds of square kilometers.
Obviously, the short-scale and short-time velocity
components are absent in its satellite evaluations, and thus satellite
velocity estimations are usually
underestimated. The time interval AT is comparable with the tide periods and from
this reason the
satellite velocity measurements should be interpreted correctly.
To consider the accuracy of the satellite technique as a technique for velocity
displacement of
large-scale water mass, we have to compare satellite and ship measurements
(1) for flows with
negligible short-scale and short-time velocity components and
(2) when the space-time discrepancy
between measurements compared is less than the space-time variability of now.
Some estimation of the FT technique accuracy on the Kuroshio extension flow
data has been
done:
1. 12 velocities calculated by satellite APT-images (year 1984) have been
compared with dynamic
method estimations by Alexanin, 1991.
The accuracy of comparing scheme was 30 cm/s.
Velocities range was 80-160 cm/s and the average difference between two fields was
AV = [S(V; U)]/N = 6.3 cm/s,
that was less then instrumental accuracy. V; and U; are projections of satellite
and in-situ velocity
measurements on the flow direction, N - the number of measurements.
48
2. The dynamic overfall across Kurosio extension on 142°E has been calculated as 90 cm by satellite
HRPT-images of 1990 (Alexanin and Kazansky, 1994) whereas according to Japanese data this
value on 144°E was near 100 cm. Such difference could be explained by natural factors.
3. Two sea surface velocities, 124 cm/s and 45 cm/s, were measured in the same region and time
aboard R/V KOFU MARU (Japan). The differences between ship and satellite velocity
measurements were 26 cm/s and 3 cm/s and the scheme accuracy was about 10 cm/s.
As we can see, the satellite velocity estimations differ from other ones in the limits of the
scheme accuracy (not worse then 20% of value).
As a rule, the FT technique was used because this method gives more information about
circulation as compared with MCC when measurement accuracy is severe.
The MCC method was
usually applied for ice velocity calculations.
4.2.2. Observation Conditions And Data Volumes Received
The ability to create sea surface velocity charts is based on the existence of sea regions without
cloudiness and mist during 6 hours or more. The results (number of velocity vectors) received
naturally depend on the weather conditions (Table 1). For this reason the most difficult place in the
Far East region is the central and southeast parts of the Okhotsk Sea in summer. Two expeditions in
the region have been supported. Circulation charts were built in operative mode and sent to the ships.
The weather conditions during these cruises were difficult (Table 2), nevertheless the detailed charts
for the most interesting regions and water objects were built 2-3 times a month using data processing
from 3-4 polar NOAA satellites. The longest time interval during which we could not make a chart
was 3 weeks. But for the last expedition we could not prepare any chart for the North-Kuril region
(approximately 3*3 degrees).
4.2.3. Chart Samples
Fig. 3a displays a chart fragment of the sea surface circulation during April 3-6, 1995. Dynamic
topography overfall of the eddy presented in the right and lower corner has been estimated as 45 cm
and velocity profile across the eddy was developed. The highest velocity revealed was 70 cm/s.
Fig. 3b presents a chart calculated during the CREAMS expedition, whose main goal was to
investigate circulation in the north part of the Japan Sea. Large-scale charts were extracted from the
velocity estimations received during August 28-31, 1993. The circulation was in a good agreement
with direct in-situ measurements.

The Tidal Influence on the Sakhalin Shelf Hydrology
Alexander A. KARNAUKHOV
Pacific Oceanological Institute, Far Eastern Branch, Russian academy of Sciences,
Vladivostok, Russia.
The international ecological expedition aboard the R/V Academik M. Lavrentjev was performed
on the eastern Sakhalin shelf in October-November of 1994.
The character of hydrological
observations was determined by small site sizes and the general situation in the studied areas.
Sites
"C" and "D" were situated in the zone of the influence the East-Sakhalin Current, on the western
periphery of the Okhotsk Sea cyclonic circulation (Fig. 1). Water masses, moved by the current, have
been formed under the influence of the Amur River drainage in the areas of the Sakhalin Gulf and
Nevel'skoy Passage. The gradual salinity increase of these waters is observed southward
All observations were carried out in the beginning of autumn - winter convection characterized
by cooling of surface waters and subsequent intermixing. The thickening of the upper homogeneous
layer, observed at this time, is accompanied by simultaneous decline of the seasonal layer of abrupt
temperature and salinity changes. The process is supported by the wind activity typical for this season.
These are the basic conditions forming the thermohaline structures of the East Sakhalin shelf region.
The small-scale spatial - temporal variability is caused basically by two factors:
(1) the strong
influence of the East Sakhalin Current executed by wind and (2) the influence of tidal motions. The
prevailing western winds force the removal of the deep stream current from the shore and the
subsequent active upwelling. During our study the wind field was quasi-stationary relative to the
period of survey (less than two days) and only tides could determine the dynamics of hydrophysical
fields.
Therefore, the full tidal cycle observations are necessary to examine the nature of temperature
and salinity variability in the area. Unfortunately, only two day measurements were performed at each
site and the actual observational period was only from 8 AM till 10 PM. The corresponding data set
makes the interpretation of results more difficult as it does not overlap the tidal cycle.
The tidal
regime off the east Sakhalin coast is rather complicated. The semidiurnal tides prevail in the southern
part of the investigated area, whereas the diurnal tides are dominant in the region of Chaivo.
Observations at sites "C" and "D" demonstrate the significant influence of tidal waves on the
temperature and salinity distribution. Based on surface T-S diagrams all stations of site "D" could
be
divided into two classes with average values equal to 5.15°C - 27.4 psu and to 5°C - 30.0 psu
(Fig. 2a.). The average time (ship time) of sampling was approximately 9:30 AM for the first class and
4:30 PM for the second class. A similar situation was observed at site "C"; here all the stations are
concentrated in two areas of the T, S plane: 5.0°C - 29.6 psu and to 4.65°C - 31.0 psu (Fig. 2b). The
lesser contrast of mean T, S characteristics on site "C" in comparison with site "D", apparently, could
be explained by the distant location of the former from the main stream of the East Sakhalin Current.
In this area the average time of sampling was about 11 AM for the first and 3 PM for the second group
of stations. It should be noted, that the periodicity of measurements of 7 and 4 hours does not
adequately reflect the temporal structure of tidal processes, since the time of observations corresponded
only to certain tidal phases and does not overlap the tidal cycle.
In other words, if the time of
54
observation is symmetric to the phase of high or low waters, the shorter periodicity will be recorded.
If a fewer number of stations is sampled during the ebb phase and more during the high water, the
longer periodicity will be fixed. This process plays
an important role in the distortion of the tide wave
form at a shoal where variations of the sea level become comparable with depth. In this case the crest
moves faster than the trough and the forward slope of a wave becomes steeper.
The coincidence of cotidal lines and isohalines (Fig. 3) reflects the significant temporal
variability in the region. The subarctic waters (the Okhotsk Sea water belongs to this water type) are
characterized by the dominant influence of salinity on water stability and stratification. Therefore the
spatial distribution of isohalines is the most representative for comparative purposes. It is remarkable,
that for both sites, the variability picture is qualitatively preserved at all horizons (Fig. 3a and 3b).
That corresponds to the present conception of current structure in the long progressive waves in the
shallow sea, where the reversal fluctuations in longitudinal (horizontal) direction prevail at all depths.
Thus, the influence of tides is reflected in horizontal shifting of the whole thermohaline water
structure.
As it was mentioned, sites "C" and "D" are situated in the area of two spatially
homogeneous water masses, which can occupy the region under study in different time periods.
During this process the entire replacement of one water type by another occurs. Taking into account
the size of the sites "C" and "D" (approximately 6x6 miles),
it seems that the amplitude of horizontal
transformation of the whole water column exceeds 3 miles. One of the mentioned water structures is
under the direct influence of the East Sakhalin Current which provides a salinity contrast forcing the
observed variability.
Assuming the tidal nature of T-S variability on the Sakhalin shelf we can conclude that the
spatial temperature and salinity distributions on sites "C" and "D" in fact represent the temporal
variability of these properties.
At 9 AM site "D" was occupied by the water mass of East Sakhalin
Current that was reflected in the freshening of the upper homogeneous layer. Hereafter, the shifting of
this water structure occurred, and before 4 PM it was completely replaced by a practically non-
stratified water mass (Figs. 4a and 4b; St. 23 and 15), conditionally called "background water". The
temperature inversions (Fig. 4, St. 15) indicate the active horizontal transformation of water masses. A
similar situation
was observed at site "C". However, the "background" conditions here were different
and were determined by the larger offshore distance and, possibly, by another character of the large-
scale circulation.
At site "C" the East Sakhalin Current water mass was observed about
11 AM (Fig. 4c, St. 34). The water mass transformation
was completed closer to 3 PM and resulted
in an
increase of salinity of the surface layer and in the deepening of the thermocline from 50-60 to 70-
80 meters (Fig. 4d, St. 32).
Investigations of the hydrophysical fields on the East Sakhalin shelf should be planned taking
into account the tidal processes in this zone.
In future, we have to coordinate the continuous
measurements at daily stations with site surveys executed during definite tidal phases. Despite the
limited
number of representative data, this study expands our understanding of dynamic processes in
this region.

On the Formation Process of the Subsurface Mixed Water
Around the Central Kuril Islands
Yasuhiro KAWASAKI
Hokkaido National Fisheries Research Institute, Kushiro, Hokkaido, 085 Japan
The formation of the Oyashio Water (Oy) seems to be related to the mixing of two Subarctic
waters: the Okhotsk Sea Water (OW) and the East Kamchatka Current Water (EKCW). On the other
hand, near the Central Kuril Islands, a relatively warm and saline Mixed Water was surveyed on the
shallow isopycnals lighter than 26.7 sigma-theta (Kawasaki and Kono, 1994).
This water shows the
vertically homogeneous temperature profile from 2 to 3°C, contrary to the dichothermal (inter-cooled)
structure with temperature lower than 2°C revealed for both Subarctic Waters. The surface layer of
the Mixed Water has peculiar characteristics: it is cold, saline, dense and rich in nutrient.
This
suggests that the Mixed Water originates from the deeper layer.
Surface silicate distribution within the study area during the period from late August to early
September 1993 is shown in Fig. la. High silicate concentrations were found over the bank (hereafter
called Bank A) to the east of the Kruzenshtern Strait and to the south of the Bussol' Strait.
Sections of
potential temperature (deg-C) and salinity (psu) as a function of potential density
(kg/m3 in sigma-theta,
cl/ton in thermosteric anomaly) through the Kruzenshtern Strait are given in Fig. 2. The origin of the
Mixed Water was observed at the Bank A (Stn. MU5) as isolated warm water with salinity higher than
33.3 psu on the isopycnal layer 26.5-26.6 sigma-theta. This suggests that the effect of bottom
topography is an important factor for the formation of the Mixed Water. In the present paper vertical
nutrient profiles will be used to discuss the mechanism of the Mixed Water formation.
We assumed that the horizontal supply of subtropical waters, like a
warm-core ring (WCR) or
Soya Warm Current waters, cause the appearance of saline and warm Mixed Water on the isopycnals
lighter than 26.7 sigma-theta. However, this is in contradiction with the nutrient data: the silicate
concentration of Subtropical Water is lower than 5 µmol/l. Also, the formation of the Mixed Water
cannot be explained by horizontal isopycnal mixing of two Subarctic Waters as they have a
dichothermal layer with temperature below 2°C. Therefore, saline and nutrient-rich water has to be
supplied from the deeper layer.
During the 1994 summer cruise, CTD and nutrient bottle sampling were carried out
concurrently within the Bussol' Strait area. The observation line through the Bussol' Strait and surface
silicate distribution are shown in Fig. lb. Silicate concentrations higher than 40 .tmol/l were revealed
in the Strait. Sections of potential temperature (deg-C), salinity (psu) and silicate (.tmol/l) as a
function of potential density (sigma-theta and thermosteric anomaly) through the Bussol' Strait during
the period from late August to early September 1994 are presented in Figs. 3a-3c. The warm, saline
and nutrient rich Mixed Water is observed in the Strait (Stn. NU1) at density levels less than 26.8
sigma-theta. Stations NU' 1, NU 1, NU5 and NU9 were selected to compare the characteristics of each
water type, i.e. OW, Mixed Water, EKCW, and Subtropical Water, respectively. Silicate and
potential density relationships for the different waters are given in Fig. 4. Numerals on the shoulder
of each symbol indicate sampling depths in hecto-meters. It should be mentioned that the upper 50 m
layer of the Mixed Water is nutrient rich and its silicate - potential density relationship is similar to
61
that of EKCW. On the other hand, OW is characterized by lower nutrient concentrations at the same
density level as compared with other Subarctic waters such as EKCW.
Vertical profiles of silicate (open symbols) and phosphate (closed symbols) for each station on
the section through the Bussol' Strait are displayed in Fig. 5.
Nutrient concentrations for the Okhotsk
Sea Water (Stn. NU' 1) do not exceed those within the upper 600 m of the Mixed Water. These data
suggest that the Mixed Water can not be produced by vertical mixing of OW itself.
Additionally,
vertical mixing within the upper 200 m of EKCW can not lead to the Mixed Water formation, as the
mean silicate concentration in the 200 m layer of EKCW is about 43 µmol/l, whereas mean silicate
concentration in the upper Mixed Water is about 56 µmol/l.
If vertical mixing of EKCW induced by tidal current over the continental shelf is predominant,
the upper Mixed Water becomes more warm, fresh, and poor in nutrients.
To consider the vertical
supply of saline and nutrient-rich water from the deeper layer, relationships between salinity and
silicate for selected station are shown as in Fig. 6. Characteristics of the Mixed Water shallower than
200 m coincide with subsurface 100-150 m layer of EKCW. Assuming silicate and salinity are more
conservative than a water property such as temperature, the dichothermal layer of EKCW (33.1-33.4
psu in salinity) might be a possible source of the upper Mixed Water. However, in this case a
heating
process should follow the upwelling. In order to heat up the 30-40 m of water column (see
Fig. 4) to
about 0.5-2°C, what kind of process should occur?
We presumed that vertical mixing induced by tidal current occurs only over the continental
shelf, however, the sill depths for the straits of the Central Kuril Islands are about 400-500 m.
Recalculated mean silicate concentration over 400 m water column, EKCW (68 µmol/l) exceeds the
mean concentration for the Mixed Water (63 µmol/1). Thus, if tidal currents around the
Central Kuril
Islands are strong enough to mix the entire water column, vertical mixing of EKCW is another possible
forcing mechanism to produce the Mixed Water.
SUMMARY
Around the Central Kuril Islands, a peculiar warm, saline and nutrient rich upper Mixed Water
was found on the isopycnals lighter than 26.7 sigma-theta near the Bank A. It seems to be responsible
for high primary production of the Oyashio. However, isopycnal mixing of two Subarctic Waters and
horizontal transport of the Subtropical Water can not produce the upper Mixed Water.
Vertical transport of the Okhotsk Sea Water is also disregarded as the source of the upper
Mixed Water formation based on the nutrient and salinity relationships, whereas upwelling of the
subsurface East Kamchatka Current Water appears to be a cause of the upper Mixed Water formation,
though the heating process after upwelling remains unknown. The entirely vertical mixing of the upper
400-600m of EKCW is another possibility for the production of the upper Mixed Water.
In future, we have to analyze the water formation process using time resolution tracers or
properties and also to carry out model experiments combined with direct current measurements around
the Bank A and within the continental shelves near the Central Kuril Islands.

Northwest Pacific Paleohydrography
Lloyd D. KEIGWIN
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, MA 02543, U.S.A.
It is important to document carefully glacial-interglacial changes in North Pacific circulation
and hydrography in order to understand changes in atmospheric pCO2 because the Pacific Ocean is the
end-member of the modern circulation regime. The modern circulation pattern tends to accumulate
CO2 in the deep Pacific, yet there has been considerable speculation that there may have been a young
deep water mass produced in the Pacific during glacial times (Mammerickx, 1985; Keigwin, 1987;
Keigwin et al., 1992; Zahn et al. 1991). In addition, it is thought that the marginal seas of the North
Pacific contribute to the ventilation of that basin at intermediate depths (for example, Reid, 1973;
Talley, 1991). Elsewhere in the world ocean it has been shown that the intermediate depth waters
were better ventilated during glaciation, at the expense of the deep ocean (Boyle and Keigwin, 1987;
Kallel et al., 1988; Oppo and Lehman, 1993). Could the processes which generate Pacific
Intermediate Water in today's ocean have been extended to produce Pacific Deep Water 15,000 years
ago?
To answer this and other critical questions about the history of northwestern Pacific
circulation, I have been involved in several cruises in the region onboard American and Russian ships
to collect new sediment cores and conduct hydrographic investigations. Paleontological and
geochemical results from numerous cores on the northern Emperor Seamounts (Fig. 1) support our
previous observations based on a single core (Keigwin et al., 1992). For example, the diatomaceous
facies centered on deglaciation is found to be widespread (see also Sancetta, 1992) and many new
Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (AMS) 14C determinations show that sedimentation rates peaked at that
time. The oxygen isotope events in deglacial benthic foraminifera have been confirmed, as has been
the evidence for a low salinity event in surface waters. Recently, we have calibrated the
813C of
the
benthic foraminifera Cibicidoides against the 813C of the total CO2 in nearby seawater samples, finding
that Cibicidoides S13C is an excellent proxy for the seawater nutrient content in the northwestern
Pacific Ocean (McCorkle and Keigwin, 1994). Carbon isotope measurements on Cibicidoides of
glacial age are uniformly low in the depth range 2,300 m to 4,000 m, supporting the contention that
deep ventilation has been low for at least the past 20,000 years. However, the lack of hemipelagic
sediment sequences from <2,300 in on the Emperor Seamounts denies us a window on the past for
shallower depths.
Previous work indicates that the Okhotsk Sea contains appropriate sediment for reconstructing
paleoclimate and paleohydrography (Gorbarenko et al., 1988; Morley et al., 1991). Many new cores
from that basin reveal that the hemipelagic deposition rates are very high and that, at least during
glacial maximum conditions, the benthic fauna contained enough Cibicidoides to reconstruct
intermediate depth hydrography (for example, Fig. 2). Cores of quality similar to Vulkanolog 34-91
have been recovered at "100 m spacing in the Kuril Basin along the seaward margin of Akademia
Nauk Rise between 1,000 and 3,200 m.
My goal is to combine data from the Okhotsk Sea cores with comparable data from the
Emperor Seamounts to produce a composite paleohydrographic profile for the far northwestern Pacific.
The two regions are shown schematically in Fig. 3. Various data from hydrocasts in the these regions,
71
including T, S, [PO4], S13C and [021, indicate that water in the Okhotsk Sea between 2,300 m and
1,000 m is in full communication with open Pacific water. This is consistent with modern views of the
intermediate depth circulation which show inflow of water to the Okhotsk Sea through Kruzenshtern
Strait (sill = 1,600 m) and outflow through Bussol' Strait (sill = 2,300 m) (Figs. 1 and 3).
I suppose that there was no barrier to this circulation pattern during glacial maximum
conditions. In addition, because of the general absence of this genus from the modern Okhotsk Sea, it
must also be assumed that Cibicidoides are as good a proxy for nutrient content of intermediate depth
water as they are for deep water. Using the S18O of the benthic foram Uvigerina to mark the glacial
maximum level in our core collection, we have taken additional samples where necessary to extract
enough Cibicidoides for S13C analysis and plotted all those results vs. water depth (Fig. 4).
In Fig. 4, data points connected by the bold solid line are the S13C of total CO2 from the
Emperor Seamounts, and the data connected by the fine line are those from the Okhotsk Sea. As noted
above, the two hydrocast data sets are indistinguishable between 2,300 in and 1,000 m.
It is seen that
where the Cibicidoides are abundant in modern sediments their 613C (open circles) lies close to the
water column data. So far, we have found Cibicidoides abundant in only one coretop from the
Okhotsk Sea, near a depth of 1,000 m off the coast of Sakhalin (BC-32 in Fig. 1).
During glacial times, Cibicidoides are present throughout the region. In the open sea the
glacial 813C data (solid circles) are systematically offset from the coretop data by an amount roughly
equivalent to the secular change in seawater chemistry (0.3-0.4 %o).
Those data argue against any
major change in deep ocean ventilation, although Cd/Ca data in benthic foraminifera are contradictory
(Boyle, 1992). Above 2,300 m, on the other hand, Okhotsk Sea S13C data indicate relatively increased
ventilation, consistent with results from other locations worldwide. If the glacial data were adjusted by
+0.3 to 0.4 %o to account for the secular change in world ocean carbon isotope composition, then it
would be seen that the change in ventilation begins at the depth of the sill at Bussol' Strait.
These
results suggest that the Okhotsk Sea was an important source of more oxygenated intermediate waters
in the glacial North Pacific Ocean. The influence of this better ventilation may be evident as far
downstream as the Gulf of California. There, in Guaymas Basin which is anoxic today at Pacific
Intermediate Water depths, glacial bottom waters contained enough oxygen to support an active
benthos (Keigwin and Jones, 1990).

Physical Mechanisms for the North Pacific Intermediate Water Formation
Talgat R. KILMATOV
Pacific Oceanological Institute, Far-Eastern Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences,
Vladivostok, Russia
1. The surface and subsurface fresh water sources for the North Pacific Intermediate Water
(NPIW) formation are disposed in the Mixed Water Region between the Kuroshio and Oyashio
Currents, especially at the Subarctic Front (SF). The analysis of the salinity fields across this region
shows that the connection of the NPIW with surface waters occurs in the SF and this front is the
southern border of the subarctic low salinity water distribution. This water moves to the southeast and
downward to the intermediate depth in the subtropical part of the North Pacific.
The surface of the North Pacific subtropical zone loses about 40 cm of pure water every year
as the result of evaporation. Assuming the low salinity water from the Subarctic
Gyre compensates the
superfluity of salt in the subtropical zone, the minimum fresh water transport is .5 Sv (106 m3/s) to
form the NPIW. The direct estimations of this transport give values of about 6 Sv (Talley and Nagata,
1995). The total volume of the NPIW is approximately 2* 10 6" km3 (Kuksa, 1968), and thus its
renewal time is 10-100 years. Based on the isotopic measurements the intermediate water longevity is
about 10 years. These data clearly demonstrate that the NPIW is an important factor influencing the
climatic change of the North Pacific on the time scales of 10-100 years.
The formation of the NPIW is due to the downwelling process.
The Subarctic Front is a
distinct downwelling zone where dynamic equilibrium keeps the climatic thermohaline front as a sharp
border in temperature and salinity fields. In this work we will review several possible physical
mechanisms of downwelling at the SF.
2. The Subarctic Front can be roughly described as the axis of the convergence.
If the SF is
regarded as the longitudinally-uniform thermohaline front, the density ratio (a0T/[3AS) is about 1 and
the cross velocity on the convergence axis equals zero. The vertical component of the planetary vortex
is the Coriolis parameter f = 2w sin (p = 0.43 *10' s', ((p 40°N), the horizontal component of the
planetary vortex is m = 2w cos cp = 0.59*10' s'. If the inertial and vorticity forces are balanced
along the convergence axis, the following equation is correct (Pedlosky, 1979):
u(du/dx)+mw =0
This equation shows that the planetary vortex produces the vertical motion on the convergence axis,
and thus, turns the inertial velocity along the SF downward. The estimation of vertical velocity gives
wu2/(mxL)__ 102cm2s-21(5.9x10--4 s'
x103km),10-4ms-'
Besides, there is a link between the latitude advection and the convergence intensity at the
climatic thermohaline front.
3. The thermohaline SF is the place of the intensive cabbeling process (Kilmatov and Kuzmin,
1990, 1991). The necessary condition of the downwelling due to the cabelling is a AT/PAS = 1. The
78
changes in temperature and salinity in the upper layer across the Subarctic Front are AT - 4=10°C
and AS - 0.5=1.5 psu. The value of the cabelling can be estimated by the next formula:
8p-0.125*d2p/d7'*d7'O0.125 *10 5g cm 3 °CZ *102 °C 10'g cm"3.
As an example,
distribution of basic hydrographic characteristics across the SF at the end of the
cooling period is presented in Table 1. The maximum of water density is emphasized.
Cabelling reaches its maximum value in winter due to the favorable conditions (Kilmatov and
Kuzmin, 1990).
Thus, in the cooling period downwelling occurs at the front to some intermediate
depth, where densities of the sinking and surrounding waters become equal. Hence, the cabelling
effect in the upper ocean layer at the SF has an annual periodicity with the maximum during the
winter.
At that time the maximum convergence is observed at the front and its kinetic energy is
transformed from the available potential energy of the cabelling process. The vertical velocity
produced by the cabelling can be evaluated from the mechanical energy balance equation:
w _hM LM ' (g h 8p/p) °'s _102M (10' m)"' (10 ms 2 * 10 m * 10')°'s ^-10' ms'
4. The cyclic sinking of the ordinary portion of the upper water layer at the SF during winter
due to the cabbeling assumes the "spotted" structure of waters in a horizontal direction at intermediate
depths. Although the NPIW in the Mixed Water Region of the Kuroshio-Oyashio is characterized by
complicated dynamic and thermohaline structure: the horizontal periodicity in values of salinity,
temperature and dissolved oxygen at depth about 300 m is observed. The "spotted" structure in the
core of the intermediate water mass with decreased salinity at a depth of 600-800 m is also found in the
subtropical part of the North Pacific. The observations show that the core of NPIW in the horizontal
direction consists of zones with closed isolines alternating at almost equal intervals of about 100-200
miles. Within these zones the decreased salt content takes place. The horizontal and vertical scales of
zones are AL - 100 km, Ah - 100 m, respectively.
Note, that the mechanism of formation of these zones does not exclude such elements as the
synoptical deformation fields.
In particular, storms, winter convection, ocean rings at the Mixed
Water Region of Kuroshio
- Oyashio lead to an increase of water exchange between the upper and
intermediate waters. But the cabelling process occurs only at the Subarctic Front and it produces the
downwelling.

Water Masses in the Okhotsk Sea
Vladimir A. LUCHIN
Far Eastern Regional Hydrometeorological Research Institute, Vladivostok, Russia
INTRODUCTION
The cold intermediate layer in the Okhotsk Sea was firstly distinguished by Makarov (1884).
The water masses in this marginal sea has been described in details by Kitani (1986), Leonov (1960)
and Moroshkin (1966).
These surveys contain many illustrations and sufficient analysis of the
previous studies.
The water structure of the southern Okhotsk Sea has been discussed by Takizawa
(1982) and Vakao and Kodzima (1962). The number of papers are devoted to the substantial
contribution of the Kuril Straits in modification of the Okhotsk Sea water (Bogdanov, 1968; Bruevich
et al., 1960; Leonov 1960; Moroshkin, 1966) and to the considerable influence of the Okhotsk Sea
hydrological processes on the North Pacific water structure (Favorite et al., 1976; Kajiura, 1949;
Kitani, 1986; Reid 1965; Tally, 1991; Wakatsuchi and Martin, 1991; Yasuoka, 1967).
DATA AND METHOD
The hydrographic (temperature and salinity) data collected at 51,607 stations during the period
from 1930 to 1988 were analyzed and classified in times (by months) and in space (trapezia of 1
degree). To distinquish the Okhotsk Sea water masses the TS analysis method was applied and T-S
curves were created for each 1 degree square.
RESULTS
The Okhotsk Sea water structure is formed under the influence of the Pacific water advection,
fall-winter cooling, river run-off, water mixing in the regions of intensive dynamics, solar radiation as
well as the system of the occurring currents. Fig. 1 strictly demonstrates four different water masses
in the Okhotsk Sea:
the surface layer, the cold intermediate layer, the deep Pacific water mass and
near-bottom water mass of the southern (Kuril) basin.
The surface layer is distinquishable only in the warm period. In winter the boundary between
the surface and cold intermediate water masses disappears.
The influence of the Pacific water is
clearly observed within the temperature field: due to the intensive tidal water mixing in the Kuril
Straits the Pacific waters are the warmest in winter and the coldest in summer (Figs. 2a, b). The same
effect takes place for the low temperature formations in summer near the Shantar Islands and at the
entrance to Shelikhov Bay. The temperature anomaly over the Kashevarov Bank is the result of the
water rising from below. The warm Soya current in the southern Okhotsk Sea is well pronounced in
the summer season.
During the whole year the more saline Pacific waters penetrate into the Okhotsk Sea and fill in
its southern and eastern parts. At the same time the coastal dilution is distinctly expressed in summer
in the western part of sea:
for instance, the influence of Amur river is observed for 100-150 miles
from the northern tip of Sakhalin Island (Figs. 2c, d).
81
In the warm period the cold intermediate water mass can be revealed in the Okhotsk Sea. The
distribution of basic temperature and salinity features are preserved in this layer during spring and
summer, but the depth of the core location increases by 20-30 in in summer as compared with spring.
The deepening of the upper boudary and core of the cold intermediate water mass continues in autumn.
Fig. 3 demonstrates characteristics of the summer modification of the cold intermediate water mass.
Temperature distribution in the core (Fig. 3c) indicates that the cold waters are transported southward
in the western part of the sea. The water flow from the Cape of Terpenie to the southern tip of
Kamchatka Peninsula is also distinquished. The intensive dynamic processes at the entrance to
Shelikhov Bay promote formation of the positive temperature values here. The salinity isolines show
the Pacific water inflow northward in the eastern part of the sea (Fig. 3d).
Fig. 4 presents properties of the deep Pacific water mass. The temperature maximum (>2°C)
is observed in this water. The T-S distribution in the core suggests that the Pacific water moves from
the Kuril Straits towards the Kashevarov Bank. The temperature within the core of the near-bottom
water mass of the southern (Kuril) basin does not exceed 1.8-1.9°C and salinity varies from 34.6 to
34.7 psu.
The density (sigma-t) distributions in the cores of the Okhotsk Sea water masses are displayed
in Fig.5. In accordance with our estimations density in the cold intermediate water mass varies from
26.0 to 26.75 sigma-t (near the Kuril Straits from 26.3 up to 26.75). In the deep Pacific water mass
the density changes from 27.0 up to 27.4 sigma-t and maximum values are observed within the Central
Kuril Straits. During the last decades the Okhotsk Sea region has been considered as one of the
sources for the North Pacific Intermediate Water formation. Taking into account the water mass
parameters (Figs. 2-5) together with the Okhotsk Sea current system (f.e., Luchin, 1995) we can
conclude that on the way to the Pacific Ocean the cold intermediate waters from the northern Okhotsk
sea (with density of 26.0-26.75 sigma-t) are blocked and transformed at least twice: first, in the
anticyclonic circulation system over the southern basin and then within the Kuril Straits Region.

Numerical Experiments with Finite Element Model of
the Okhotsk Sea Circulation
Andrey V. MARTYNOV, Elena N. GOLUBEVA and Victor I. KUZIN
Computing Center, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk, Russia
INTRODUCTION
In the recent years the coastal areas and marginal seas of the World ocean attract the attention
of oceanographers. This interest derives from the fact that these regions are of exceptional importance
for the earth's climate and from the point of view that the overwhelming majority of nations' marine
activities are performed within 200 mile Exclusive Economical Zones. This special interest did not
exclude scientists working in the numerical modeling of oceanic processes. Some well known general
ocean circulation models were used as regional models to investigate the circulation of the Greenland
and Norwegian Seas (Legutke, 1991), the South China Sea (Shaw and Chao, 1994), the Japan Sea
(Holloway et al., 1995), etc. The Okhotsk Sea is the object of the present study.
The general circulation of the Okhotsk Sea consists of a large cyclonic gyre which begins with
surface and subsurface northward flow of the North Pacific water through the Kruzenshtern Strait
along the Kamchatka Peninsula (the West Kamchatka current), then curves to the northern part of the
Okhotsk Sea and flows south along the Sakhalin Island as the Eastern Sakhalin current. The existence
of counter currents with the same names one is mentioned for both cases in some recent references
(e.g., Zhigalov and Figurkin, 1994). Main features of the current system are the Oyashio inflow
through the northern straits and its outflow through the central straits. The warm Soya current inflows
through the Soya strait in the southern part of the Okhotsk Sea, comes along the Hokkaido Island and
outflows through the Kunashiri strait (Leonov, 1960; Luchin, 1987).
The air circulation above the Okhotsk Sea has a monsoon character which is controlled by the
interconnection of the main high and low pressure centers above the mainland and adjacent sea regions
during winter and summer. Strong northerly geostrophic winds dominate during the winter monsoon
and weak winds from the opposite direction are more typical for the summer monsoon. Investigation
of the Okhotsk Sea water circulation response to the seasonal variability of the wind stress in the
region is the primary goad of the present study. Analogous numerical experiments were performed by
Sekine (1990). The main distinctions of that study from the above mentioned work are connected with
some differences in the model formulation. We used different bottom topography as well as wind
stress data.
The 3-D ocean general circulation model of the Novosibirsk Computing Center (1986) is
adapted to the Okhotsk Sea. This model was earlier applied for the Kuroshio region (Kuzin et al.,
1992). The bottom topography used in the model is presented in Fig. 1. The horizontal grid size is
0.25°. The study region covered the entire Okhotsk Sea with the exception of the shelf region with
depths less than 30 m.

WIND STRESS DATA
Wind stress is one of the major factors determining the strength of the surface currents. The
model was forced using both the monthly climatological wind stress data of Wright (1988) and the
seasonal wind stress data prepared based on the same source. These data are sparse and their coverage
implies some uncertainty, nevertheless, they were used to increase the wind stress influence because of
their higher values in comparison with the analogous data of Hellerman and Rosenstein (1983)(HR):

* All values are in dyne/cm2-
Numerical experiments were carried out for selected seasons and 12 months separately. The
definition of seasons has no rigid "calendar" in this region where the first sea ice forms in November
and covers up to 97% of the sea surface in March-April (Wakatsuchi and Martin, 1990).
So, the
winter period can continue in the Okhotsk Sea for 5-6 months.
The following approach was applied to select the seasonal wind stresses:
winter and summer
fields were estimated by averaging the monthly mean data of December, January, February, and June,
July, August, respectively; spring and autumn fields were estimated by averaging the monthly mean
data of April and May, and October and November, respectively. The selected averaging periods were
used in order to correctly consider the impact of winds. According to the available wind stress data
the winter monsoon begins in October and relatively stable strong northern and western winds are
conserved during October and November (Fig. 2d). With the development of a high-pressure center
over Siberia a wind stress field is reconstructed and northern winds prevail. The sea
ice cover initially
forms in northern bays and along the continental shelf.
The position of the sea ice edge spreads
southward under the influence of cold air coming from the north and due to transportation by the
northerly wind. This wind is rather stable for three months but its influence on water circulation is
less remarkable compared to the autumn because of the gradual decrease in the open water zone (Fig.
2a). The maximum area of ice is observed in March when transformation of the wind stress field to
the summer monsoon begins and the western winds prevail.
The influence of the sea ice cover is
essentially during the whole spring season including May (Fig. 2b).
To specify this influence in
numerical experiments, no wind stress was imposed above the ice covered regions for both winter and
spring. The mean location of the ice edge was defined from the Pacific Ocean Atlas (1974).
A
relatively stable southern wind is dominant during June, July and August (Fig. 2c).
Mean and
maximum (Fig. 2) estimates of the wind stress show that wind strength is higher in the autumn and
winter periods, and it is weaker in spring and summer.

NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS WITH BAROTROPIC MODEL
The simulation of seasonal situations for the general water circulation clearly shows the
presence of cyclonic circulation in autumn (Fig. 3d) which corresponds the most known references
listed in PICES report No.2 (1995). Simultaneously, the anticyclonic gyre is formed within the Kuril
Basin. The cyclonic circulation is also revealed in winter, but only at the central part of the Sea (Fig.
3a). At the same time, two anticyclonic gyres appear to the north and south of the cyclonic one.
Spring and summer distribution of the stream function (Fig. 3b and c) is smoother and does not
represent the analogous large-scale formations with the exception of the small cyclonic gyre west off
Kamchatka and anticyclonic circulation in the southern part of the Okhotsk Sea during the summer
season.
The results of numerical experiments for 12 monthly mean wind stress fields (not presented in
figures) suggest that the cyclonic circulation is formed under the influence of steady northern and
north-western winds as a main feature of the Okhotsk Sea from October till April. This circulation is
replaced by the anticyclonic one from April till September, but its intensity is several times weaker.
The Eastern Sakhalin current is expressed best of all in December.
Some other characteristic quasi-stationary features were obtained in the northwestern part of
the Okhotsk Sea, west off the Kamchatka Peninsula and north off Hokkaido. In particular, the last two
circulations are very important because of their significant influence on the strength of the West
Kamchatka and the Soya Currents. The change in rotation is observed during the annual cycle for both
cases. The first medium scale circulation is formed near the entrance to Shelikhov Bay. There
is the
cyclonic eddy at this location which enhances the West Kamchatka Current for June, July and August.
The anticyclonic rotation is typical for an eddy situated at the same location from December till May.
As a result the intensification of the counter current with the opposite direction (from north to south) is
observed west of Kamchatka. In the southern part of the Okhotsk Sea the cyclonic eddy induces the
enhancement of the warm Soya current from November till March. The existence of similar cyclonic
eddies north off Hokkaido coast has been reported on the basis of the radar imagery data collected
during 1969-1988 (Wakatsuchi and Ohshima, 1990). The anticyclonic eddy occurring near the same
92
location promotes the weakening of the Soya current and decreases the intensity of the western
boundary circulation during the period from April till October.
NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS WITH 3-D MODEL
At the next stage of the study the density stratification was included in the model which has 21
vertical levels. Shelihova Bay was excluded from the domain as temperature/salinity data for this
region are not available. The climatological temperature and salinity distributions for summer were
used in the initial conditions. These data were prepared on the basis of all observations accessible at
the Far Eastern Regional Hydrometeorological Institute, Vladivostok, Russia (V. Luchin, personal
communication). The model was spun up by the summer wind stress field prepared on the basis of the
monthly mean stresses of Wright (1988). At the diagnostic stage the numerical integration was made
with a 15 minute time step. According to the control of the total kinetic energy the equilibrium state
was attained after 20 days of model time. The adaptation calculations with the whole system of
equations were carried out for another 30 days. Some preliminary results are presented below.
The Ekman drift dominates the flow in the upper layer from the surface to about 30 m. There
is no obvious cyclonic circulation on the whole. Although the structure of currents is very complex,
some main features of the Okhotsk Sea general circulation are revealed. The north periphery of the
anticyclonic gyre above the Kuril Basin is well-developed but the gyre is divided into several cyclonic
and anticyclonic eddies. The Eastern Sakhalin current begins to appear below 50 m, it spreads
southward to about 50"N, the West Kamchatka current flows north of about 55°N, and strong
anticyclonic eddy extends from the upper layers to the bottom near the Kashevarov Bank north of
Sakhalin Island. An intense stream in the southern part of the Okhotsk Sea is artificial. The
appearance of this simulated stream is connected, probably, with extrapolation of initial data to the
southern part of the domain and can not be recognized as the Soya Current directly. Also the
formation of two eddies, exactly in the central part of the Sea, is induced by data discrepancy in this
region (initial temperature/salinity fields did not smooth to test the model sensitivity for different
instabilities).
DISCUSSION
The obvious dependence of the general Okhotsk Sea water circulation on the wind stress field
is considered in the present investigation. The reconstruction of atmospheric conditions from the
winter monsoon to the summer monsoon induces the essential changes of the whole current system in
the region. But this alteration embraces only thin the upper 20-30 meters layer. Some characteristic
features of the general circulation and its variability in the annual cycle are obtained in this layer
during numerical experiments with the barotropic model. At the second stage of our research some
interesting features of the vertical structure of the Okhotsk Sea current system are simulated. For
example, the Eastern Sakhalin current is well-developed in the subsurface layer (50-200 m). This
current can transport the water generated in the northern part of the Okhotsk Sea far to the south.
Preliminary presentation of in-flow and out-flow through the passages is proposed at the next
stage of this study. Winter observations are very sparse even in the open water regions, but during
future experiments we hope to prepare some climatic winter fields for comparison with the summer
season.

Structure of Intermediate Water Layer in the Northwest Pacific
Nikolay A. MAXIMENKO, Anatoly I. KHARLAMOV and Raissa I. GOUSKINA
Institute of Oceanology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia
Data collected during Japanese surveys in the northwestern Pacific (Fig. 1) were used to
investigate the spatial structure and seasonal variability of the North Pacific Intermediate Water
(NPIW) (Talley, 1993). The corresponding information for about 1,300 hydrographic stations in the
area contoured by 30-50°N and 140-155°E was published in "The Results of Marine Meteorological
and Oceanographic Observations" in 1970-80's. We revealed that although the depth of the salinity
minimum and water properties at that depth express significant temporal variations (connected,
probably, with eddies activity) their spatial structure is quite stable. The NPIW layer outcrops around
40-42°N where salinity, temperature, potential density and oxygen content are equal to 33.3 psu, 5°C,
26.5 sigma theta and 6.9 ml/l, respectively.
Two principal results were obtained from the general analysis of these data:
1. Spatial variability along the latitude of 41°N did not exceed the accuracy of measurements as well
as no reliable difference has been found between sections along 144°E, 148°E and 150°E.
2. Seasonal variability beneath the depth of 100 m was not identified (it was also below the data
accuracy).
In the meridional direction the NP1W layer deepens southward to a depth of 800 m at 30°N
where the salinity, temperature and potential density reach 34.1 psu, 6.2°C and 26.95 sigma-theta,
respectively, but concentration of dissolved oxygen drops to 3.0 ml/l. Typical standard deviations of
those parameters are equal to 30 m, 0.03psu, 0.2°C, 0.03 sigma-theta and 0.3 ml/l. Thus, within the
NPIW all characteristics are variable and, hence, the layer cannot be traced by any fixed iso-surface
(e.g., isohaline or isopycnal). The only distinct tracer of the NPIW is a salinity minimum at an
intermediate depth.
The following features of the NPIW layer structure have been determined from the detailed
analysis of data along 155°E between 45°N and the equator (Fig. 1):
a) The NPIW outcrops again at 7-8°N around the Subtropical Front (Fig. 2a);
b) At the southern edge of the NPIW layer salinity and temperature increase (Figs. 2b and c), whereas
the content of dissolved oxygen and potential density (Figs. 2d and e) decrease southward;
c) Curvatures of vertical salinity (Fig. 2f) and temperature (Fig. 2g) profiles are positive everywhere
and express the highest values at the southern and northern edges of the NPIW layer, while the
curvature of the dissolved oxygen profile (Fig. 2h) is much noisier and at any latitude it has
readings of both signs.
These data were also used to investigate kinematic and dynamic properties of the NPIW layer.
Important for our consideration is the fact that the stationary solution of the diffusion equation for
salinity may not contain internal extremes without intrusions of "new" water from the boundaries.
Since the salinity vertical profile has a minimum in the middle of the layer, the value of this minimum
grows towards the equator and the curvature is positive everywhere, we anticipate southward water
flow along 155 °E.
99
Mathematically this can be expressed in the following way. Using the above conclusions 1 and
2 (stationary and weak spatial variability of the NPIW layer structure), full equations of salinity,
temperature and dissolved oxygen evolution may be presented as
V x Sy = ks x Szz
, (1)
VxT=k,xTZZ,
(2)
V x 0,, = ko x OZZ - q, (3)
where y- and z-axis are parallel and normal, respectively, to the NPIW layer (traced as a salinity
minimum), V is velocity component along y-axis, k; is corresponding diffusion coefficient, expected
to be positive (below we will suggest that effective mixing processes in the NPIW are governed by
turbulence and all the k-coefficients are of the same magnitude), q is dissolved oxygen dissipation rate
due to biological and chemical processes (also expected to be positive). Thus (1-3) may be rewritten as
V/k=Szz/Sy=Tzz/T,.=Ozz/O,.-q/O,,
(4)
and the two last equations of (4) may be checked from the data. A good correspondence between Szz /
Sy and T,z / T,, and significant difference between S
a
/ Sy and Ozz / Oy were revealed (Fig. 3), that
can be explained by a large positive q. Roughly Fig. 3 provides an estimate for meridional velocities
V,& -1cmtxk (5)
that gives 1 cm/s for typical value of k = 1 cm2/s and should be directed everywhere towards the
equator.
Thus, we may conclude that the source of a "new" NPIW is located at the southern edge of the
layer. The NPIW has a tendency to shift equatorward and must outcrop and "die" at the Subtropical
Front. This event was observed by Bingham and Lukas (1994), but the mechanism is not clear yet.
Of course, meridional motion should be superimposed on the general large-scale circulation in the
North Pacific, however some results suggest that this effect is not so strong (Kilmatov and Kuzmin,
1991).
Our attempts to investigate physical mechanisms of the NPIW formation and dynamics
(Maximenko et al., 1995) revealed that the local geostrophic balance can be disturbed by vertical
(diapycnal) mixing that in the case of tilted isopycnals will push water particles quasi-isopycnally up or
down towards a new geostrophic equilibrium. From traditional 2D dynamic equations we can derive
for meridional velocity
V=-gxtanOxp1/(paxf2) (6)
where g is the gravitational constant, O is, tilt of isopycnals, f is the Coriolis parameter, po is
seawater density and pp is evolution rate in time. Depending on sign of pp water should sink or
rise, what we really observe in the NPIW layer.
Values of p, for the section along 155°E (calculated as a local evolution of po due to
vertical mixing of temperature and salinity) were found to be in good correlation with Figs. 2a and 2e:
p, has the same sign as the tilt of isopycnals. Again if k is estimated as lcm2/s, V is equal about
1 cm/s and is directed towards the equator.
Quite unexpected results have been obtained from our investigation of the cabbeling effect on
NPIW dynamics. We developed an original formal mathematical description of cabbeling rate that for
the salinity minimum layer can be written as
100
)2 Ptabb PTT (T7
(7)
We found that the cabbeling effect is significant everywhere in the NPIW layer and its
contribution to local density evolution reaches 30%. That means that analysis of the NPIW should be
based on the exact nonlinear equation of state.

Fine-structure of the North Pacific Intermediate Water Layer
Nikolay A. MAXIMENKO and Andrey Yu. SHCHERBINA
Institute of Oceanology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia
INTRODUCTION
The North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW), characterized by an obvious salinity minimum
and slight increase of dissolved oxygen concentration, is observed within the latitude range 10-40°N
(Yang and Nagata, 1992). This layer outcrops at its border contouring the area of the Subtropical
water mass distribution. In the north the NPIW is limited by the Subarctic Front (SF). The concept of
the NPIW formation by waters of the Okhotsk and Japanese Seas (Yang and Nagata, 1992) coexists
with the hypothesis of its role as an interface between the Subtropical and Subarctic water masses
(Burkov, 1972). The search for a possible physical processes governing the NPIW formation and
evolution is under way.
Role of cabbeling in the frontal zone has been investigated by Kilmatov and Kuzmin (1991).
In accordance with Talley (1993), at a narrow front cabbeling breaks the pre-existing geostrophic
equilibrium and forces the layer to slip down isopycnically to recover the balance.
The proposed
mechanism is expected to be the most efficient in the upper ocean at sharp fronts. Data collected from
the section along 155°E demonstrated that the dynamics of the NPIW layer in the central and southern
parts is determined by the diapycnal (vertical) heat and salt mixing and resulted in an equatorward drift
of the layer, superimposed on a subtropic gyre (Maximenko et al., 1995).
DATA
We analyzed numerous CTD data of the "Megapolygon" experiment conducted in the summer-
fall period of 1987 in the 500 x 500 km area centered at 40°N and 155°E (Ivanov, 1992). To decrease
the effect of the probe calibration, as well as to exclude mesoscale variability of various fields, our
primary attention was paid to long longitudinal sections carried out by the same vessel. The section
along 152°E, carried out by R/V "Vityaz" in October 1987 with 20 miles resolution, is a good example
and is discussed below.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
At least three sub-mesoscale objects are disclosed within the NPIW layer which is clearly seen
as a salinity minimum (Fig. 1). These objects are characterized by negative salinity and temperature
anomalies of 0.1 psu and 0.6°C, respectively. The horizontal (in the meridian direction) diameter of
the anomalies does not exceed 40 miles occupying depths of 200-400 in.
Analysis of vertical profiles
of 1 in resolution revealed well developed fine-structure inside the mesoscale anomalies mentioned
above. Temperature and salinity pulsations are as much as 5-10 times higher than in surrounding
waters (Fig. 1). Vertical profiles of water properties at one specific station are shown in Fig. 2. Note,
that pulsations of T and S, reaching 0.1 psu and 0.6°C, respectively, do not influence the stability of
104
stratification, which can be explained by their good inter-correlation (Fig. 3). The vertical scale of the
pulsations varies from 1 to 60 meters.
We have discovered that in the horizontal plane the anomalies look like isolated intra-
thermocline lenses. Within the "Megapolygon" area we observed simultaneously 3 to 5 such lenses
associated with negative temperature and salinity anomalies, each being 40 miles or less in diameter.
The actual number of the anomalies could be even greater as not all of them were resolved by the
sampling grid. The typical scale of horizontal coherence of T and S pulsations was close to the
distance between the stations (20 miles).
Fig. 4 displays the Cox numbers (< > sign shows averaging over the 200 m layer centered at
the salinity minimum depth) calculated along the Section as
< (VT
)2
> < (VS')2 >
CT < VT >2
Cs
< VS >2
(1)
CT exceeds Cs by 1.4 times almost everywhere in the NPIW. Assuming that molecular diffusion
plays the leading role at the finest resolved scale and that the mixing process at the larger scale is
governed by developed turbulence, we can estimate the turbulent diffusion coefficients as
KT = kT C; = 2.10-2 cm'/s and Ks = ks Cs = 6.10' cm2/s, where kT and ks are corresponding
coefficients of molecular diffusion. Although this evaluation is very rough, the difference between the
coefficients as well as their small values prove the pulsations to be a feature of fossil turbulence rather
than of a developed one. The time of dissipation of anomalies with a vertical scale of h = 30m
t = h2 I K (2)
is equal to 5.108 s » 15 years for the temperature and 2.1010 s M 500 years for the salinity. This means
that our lenses may have a long pre-history and still preserve the footprints of the processes which
formed the lenses.
Another possible source of the pulsations is the isopycnal intrusions, which are frequently
observed on narrow fronts and on the periphery of mesoscale intra-thermocline lenses. Calculations of
potential temperature and salinity on the surfaces of constant potential density show that corresponding
isopycnal gradients are too weak to provide high values of pulsations. Moreover, water properties
viewed in the lenses can be found nowhere except for the vicinity of the Subarctic Front where high
mean gradients coexist with high small-scale pulsations of temperature and salinity.
Thus, from both approaches we may conclude:
- the fine-structure of the anomalies revealed contains water relevant to that observed around the SF;
- both the temperature and salinity pulsations are generated by intensive local mixing at the SF,
rather than by local dynamics of the sub-mesoscale anomalies;
- those sub mesoscale anomalies represent a "new" intermediate water, which ventilates the layer.
It should be noted, that all three lenses on the section described above (Fig. 1) are located
inside the large warm anticyclonic eddy, which is, apparently, a separated Kuroshio meander shifted
about 300 km north from the Kuroshio Extension. Such an eddy can create a local narrow high-
contrast front essential for effective mixing and cabbeling.

An Experimental Study of Water Transport through
the Straits of Okhotsk Sea by Electromagnetic Method
Renat D. MEDJITOV and Boris I. REZNIKOV
Pacific Oceanological Institute, Far Eastern Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences,
Vladivostok, Russia
Studies of water dynamics and transport through straits require rapid and accurate observations
of water velocities over large spatial scales. Application of standard oceanographic technique is
complicated due to hydrometeorological conditions of the area. Significant new information about
steady and variable ocean transport can be extracted from the measurements of motion induced electric
fields being made with submarine cables and towed electrode systems. Such experiments were
performed in the Nevelskoy Strait with the aid of a bottom mounted electrode system that detected the
horizontal electric fields at several points of the Strait. Information about lateral and temporal
structure of water exchange between the Japan Sea and the Okhotsk Sea was obtained. From these
results it is evident that the data were dominated by diurnal and semidiurnal tidal elements.
Geomagnetic electro kinetograph (GEK) profiling of the Kuril Straits was realized using towed
electrodes to demonstrate the possibilities of this method for future oceanographic investigations.
INTRODUCTION
The depth integral of horizontal water velocity (the transport) in the straits is one of the
fundamental characteristics of general water circulation in the Sea. Only two conventional tools to
measure barotropic currents are now available. Long-term observations of the velocity fields can be
carried out directly with a. set of current meters, but this method is usually costly, especially if good
resolution is desired. The second method is based on calculations of the bottom pressure records.
An unconventional. technology measuring the motion induced electric field is also available for
direct observation of transport, but it remains almost unclaimed. This technique detects signals which
arise from the motion of sea water through the Earth's magnetic field and contain information about
local and regional water velocities. The method of towed electrode pairs or geomagnetic electro
kinetograph (GEK) and the utilization of submarine cables are two principal examples of the
electromagnetic approach to measuring sea flows. Only a few of that kind of results in straits are
known at present, in particular, measurements carried out by Teramoto (1971) in the Sugaru Strait, by
Larsen and Sanford (1985) in the Florida current and by Bowden, (1961) near England. This is quite
an abnormal situation, since the induced electric fields can yield information on both the spatial and
temporal variability of transport in real time scale by using simple, reliable and very cheap tools. This
paper presents examples of electromagnetic measurements that have been made in the Straits of
Okhotsk Sea.
METHOD AND INSTRUMENTS
The theory of motional electromagnetic induction in the ocean has been refined over the last
few decades. In the case where temporal magnetic fluctuations can be neglected, the electric field E
111
and electric current density J arising from interaction of moving water with Earth's magnetic field
F are related by the Ome's law for moving conducting media:
E=Vf =VF-Jls (1)
where f is the electric potential, V is the velocity vector and s is the electric conductivity.
To define the vector velocity field V, in general case we need to accomplish the simultaneous
measurements of F and J at the same points or to determine only one of these parameters and use
an adequate theoretical model of induction process based of Maxwell's equations. Usually
it is a rather
difficult and complex problem, but in some specific situations it can be simplified. Namely, in the low
frequency limit when the effect of self induction is weak, the vertical velocity may be neglected by
comparison with the horizontal components. Further assuming that the ocean bottom is flat, it can be
shown that in the stationary reference frame the induced horizontal electric field is related to the
horizontal velocity field by (Sanford, 1971)
EH =CFz<VH>' (2)
where C is a constant, Fz is the known local vertical component of the geomagnetic field, <VH >
is the vertically-averaged sea water conductivity -
weighted horizontal water velocity determined by
IV,,
(z) . 6(z) - dz
<VH>'= ° (3)
J6(Z) . dz
0
and H is the depth.
Due to the cross-product relationship in equations (1) - (2), the north electric field is
proportional to the west component of <VH >8, and the east electric field is proportional to the north
component of < VH >` .
Oceanographic interpretation of equations (2) and (3) depends on the specific effects of the
scale factor C and sea water conductivity weighting in (3). The first of these values is principally a
function of the local sea floor electrical conductivity structure, and is a measure of the extent to which
electric currents induced in the ocean are shorted out by underlying rock. Theoretical predictions
suggest that C should lie between 0.9 and 1, and observations give actual values of 0.91-0.94 (Sanford,
1971).
For many oceanic regions, i.e., such as shallow wide straits, it can be shown that the quantity,
specified by equation (3) is nearly equivalent to the simple vertically-averaged horizontal water
velocity, also called the transport T [m3/sec], so the expression (2) can be reduced to the following
form
4f =FzTlH (4)
From the other hand, in a reference frame attached to a water element moving at the velocity V, an
observer would measure the so-called apparent electric field EA
EA=J/s=Bz.(VH-<VH>')=kFzVH (5)
where V. is the local velocity at the depth of measurement, and "k-factor" is an empirical parameter
defined as
112
k=IVHII VH-<VH>*I
So, the GEK data should. be interpreted as a vector difference between the surface and vertically
averaged velocities (Sanford[, 1971).
The surface drift generated by wind and waves generally effects only a very shallow surface
layer h in such a way, that h is often small compared to H
k =(I -h / H)-' -1, (6)
and therefore, GEK is a very suitable tool to study a shallow surface drifts in a deep sea.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The long-term observations of the velocity field were performed in the Nevelskoy Strait with
the aid of bottom deployed electrode system that measured the horizontal electric fields at several
points of the Strait. This Strait separates the Sakhalin Island from the Main Land and is the place
where the water exchange between the Japan Sea and Okhotsk Sea occurs.
The bottom topography with the disposition of electrodes is shown on Fig. 1. Five electrodes
in contact with sea water were connected to the measuring circuit by an insulated cable at a distance of
0.2 km, 0.75 km, 2 km, 3 km and 5 km from the shore. This method can be operated to examine the
lateral structure of the horizontal electric field, and hence the structure of transport in the Strait. We
used the silver-silver chloride electrodes selected in such a way that any pair difference in electrode
potential was hundred of times smaller than would be observed in the Strait.
Fig. 2 displays the data (a one-day section) registered by different pairs of the electrodes
(curves 1 - 4). Curve 5 shows the potential difference over the whole section (electrodes 1 - 5), while
curve 6 represents the sum of the results on separate elements of antenna (curves 1 - 4). It is evident
that results of measurements are dominated by irregular diurnal and semidiurnal tidal elements with
velocity and transport amplitudes up to 80 cm/sec and 4.104 m'/sec, respectively, and with
approximately zero average transport. It should be noted that the presented data were obtained during
quiet weather. Under other weather conditions with a strong north wind the southward water transport
was found in the Strait. An excellent coincidence of the curves 5 and 6 demonstrates experimental
evidence of the theoretical prediction, and thus we can use only two electrodes to measure the total
transport through the Strait.
A horizontal GEK-profiling along the Kuril Straits was conducted in August 1983. The results
are presented in Fig. 3, where one component of the surface velocity normal to the vessel's course is
drawn (k- factor in equation 5 was found being equal to 0.8 from the hydrological soundings).
It is evident from the data, that currents were not uniform, but consisted of a set of individual
narrow streams frequently with opposite directions. Besides, this velocity structure is not an
instantaneous picture, as it took about two days to cross all these straits and, certainly, the surface
currents depend upon the spatial and temporal structure of wind. So, we naturally see that these data
do not constitute a considerable global oceanological result, but are presented here only to demonstrate
the possibilities of electromagnetic methods for the sea current measurements.

Oceanological Zoning of the Kuril Islands Area in the Spring-Summer Period
Valentina V. MOROZ
Pacific Oceanological Institute, Far Eastern Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences,
Vladivostok, Russia
In the present paper we provide the regional classification of water adjacent to the Kuril Islands
(within a 120-mile zone) in both the Okhotsk Sea and Pacific Ocean for the spring-summer period.
The following materials were considered during this study:
1. Expeditions of the Pacific Oceanological Institute of Far-Eastern Branch of Russian Academy of
Siences to the Kuril Straits in the spring-summer period of 1989-1991,
2. Expeditions of the Pacific Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography to the South Kuril
Islands region in the spring-summer period of 1980-1988,
3. Japanese expeditions to the Kuril Islands area in the spring-summer period of 1963-1972.
Based on systematization of temperature and salinity data and results of T-S analysis, five
different thermohaline structures were revealed in the region:
1. Pacific type (Oyashio water)
2. Okhotsk Sea type
3. South Okhotsk Sea type (Soya current zone)
4. Deep straits zone type (Kuril Straits variety of subarctic structure)
5. Islands shelf zone type (homogenized).
Distribution of these water types is shown in Fig.1, while thermohaline indexes of the
corresponding water masses are given in Table 1.
It was shown that the water structures displayed above are separated by frontal zones of
various intensity, namely by:
1. Oyashio front
2. Okhotsk Sea Kuril front
3. Soya current front
4. Kuril straits fronts
5. Shallow zone fronts.
It was also found., that peculiarities of formation and distribution of different water structure
types are not constant and are conditioned by the variable intensity of the current system in the area.

Note on the salinity balance in the Okhotsk Sea
Yutaka NAGATA
Faculty of Bioresources, Mie University, Tsu, Mie-ken, Japan
The source water of the North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) is believed to be generated
in the shelf region of the northwestern Okhotsk Sea (e.g. Talley and Nagata, 1995: the figures used in
the following discussion will be referred by figure numbers in this report). Sea ice formation occurs
actively in the coastal polynya just off the Siberian coast throughout winter season, and the annual rate
of the dense water formation is estimated to be about 0.5 Sv by Alfultis and Martin (1987). They urge
that the volume of the formed dense water is large enough to maintain NPIW, as it is doubled by
horizontal mixing before it flows out into the North Pacific Ocean and reaches to the formation area of
NPIW. We shall discuss whether such a formation process of the dense water is physically feasible by
considering salinity balance.
Characteristics of the waters and oceanic currents which would affect the salinity balance in the
Okhotsk Sea are:
1. The temperature of the dense shelf bottom water is almost at freezing point - 1.8°C, and the
salinity is between 33.3 and 33.6 psu (Kitani 1973: Fig.2.3.29). We assume the typical salinity
value here as 33.5 psu.
2. The salinity of the surface water in the shelf region is 32.5 psu in summer and between 32.7 and
33.2 psu in winter. Its temperature in winter is -1.8°C (Kitani, 1973 and Reid, 1965). We assume
the typical salinity value as 325 psu.
3. As to the salinity of the East Kamchatka Current Water near the northern straits of the Kuril
Islands, 33.1 psu is selected as the typical value from the figures of Ohtani (1989) (Fig. 2.5.4).
4. The salinity at the temperature minimum (almost at freezing point) in the central part of the
Okhotsk Sea is from 32.9 psu (sigma-t 26.5) to 33.1 psu (sigma-t 26.7). We select 33.0 psu as the
typical value (Kitani, 1973: Fig.2.3.29).
5. The salinity of the Soya Current Water is about 34.0 psu, and the averaged flow rate is 0.7 Sv
(Aota and Ishikawa, 1991).
6. The fresh water supply from Amur River into the region under consideration is of the order of
0.01 Sv (Aota and Ishikawa, 1991).
7. The volume transport from the Pacific Ocean to the Okhotsk Sea through the northern straits of the
Kuril Islands is not clear, but is estimated to be 13.2 Sv by Kurashina et al. (1967). The averaged
salinity value in the upper 1,900 in layer is about 34.1 psu. The transport from the Okhotsk Sea to
the North Pacific through the southern straits of the Kuril Islands is 16.7 Sv (Kurashina et al.,
1967). The averaged salinity of the upper 1,900 in is about 33.9 psu. We use these values
tentatively.
If we assume the formation rate of the dense water in the shelf region is 0.5 Sv as estimated by
Alfultis and Martin (1987), the resulting salinity loss of the surface layer due to ice formation is:
120
(33.5 - 32.5) x 10-3 Kg/m3 x 0.5 x 106 m3/s = 0.5 x 10' Kg/s (1)
If the salinity loss is balanced with the horizontal transport in the surface layer from the East
Kamchatka Current Water, the required transport U is:
(33.1 - 32.5) x 10-3 Kg/ms X U = 0.5 x 10' Kg/s, and U = 1.1 Sv. (2)
This value would be considerably underestimated because the distance between the East
Kamchatka Current and the shelf regions is about 1,000 km, and because the effective horizontal
salinity difference may be one order of magnitude smaller than that used in the above estimation. So,
the surface current in the order of 10 Sv is required to be flowing into the region. This is not realistic
as we find no eminent current there.
One of the curious behaviors of the dense shelf water is that it looses its high-salinity before it
flows out into the central part of the Okhotsk Sea (Kitani, 1973: Fig. 23.2.8-9), though its
temperature remains almost at freezing point. This indicates that the water is mixed with low-salinity
cold water, which may be found in the surface layer in late winter or in early spring. If we assume its
salinity is equal to the typical value (32.5 psu) in the surface layer in the shelf region, the mixing ratio
R of the dense shelf water with the cold surface water can be given:
32.5 R + 33.5 x (1-R) = 33.0, and R = 0.5. (3)
Namely, the dense water is mixed with the surface water in the ratio of 1:1. This would be reasonable
as we find vertically homogeneous water over the Kashevarova Bank which is thought to be generated
by strong tidal mixing there (Kitani and Shimazaki, 1971: Figs. 2.3.22 through 2.3.24). This means
that half the amount (0.25 x 10' Kg/s) of the salt, which has been given for the shelf bottom layer due
to the ice formation, is carried back to the surface layer due to the mechanical mixing in the sea
adjacent to the bank.
If net water transport from the surface to the bottom layer due to ice formation is negligible,
the dense shelf water would flow out into the central Okhotsk Sea at the rate of 0.5 Sv, and the
relatively less saline water would flow into the shelf bottom layer at the same rate. The salinity loss in
the shelf bottom layer is giiven by
(33.5 - 33.0) x 10 "3 Kg/m3 x 0.5 x 10 6 m3/s = 0.25 x 10' Kg/s. (4)
Thus, a half of the salt gain of the bottom layer due to ice formation is carried back to the
surface layer, and another half is just carried out from the shelf bottom layer to the intermediate layer
of the central Okhotsk Sea.
However, it would be reasonable to assume that some amount of net water mass is transported
from the surface to the bottom layer in the process of dense water formation. This would result in the
net outflow from the shelf bottom region to the central Okhotsk Sea. If we denote this transport with
V, the amount of the salt carried out into the central Okhotsk Sea is 33.5 x 10-' Kg/m3 x V. Even if
the net water flux is 1/1,000 of the generation rate of the dense water formation rate (0.005 Sv), the
resulting salt flux is 0.16 x 1103 Kg/s, and of the same order of magnitude as the salt fluxes in the above
discussion. This indicates that the accuracy of the present discussion is very limited, and further
elaborated investigations would be needed.
The salinity balance in the surface layer of the shelf region is much more complicated as we
need to consider the fresh water supply from Amur River. This salinity loss may be estimated as:
(33.5 - 0.0) x 10-3 Kg/m3 x 0.01 x 106 m3/s = 0.34 x 103 Kg/s. (5)
121
This amount is almost the same order of magnitude as the salinity loss due to the ice formation (0.5 x
103 Kg/s). However, the same amount of the water mass in the surface layer should flow out from the
shelf region to the central Okhotsk Sea. If the salinity of the out flow is that of the surface shelf water,
there would be no net salinity gain or loss. However, most of the Amur River fresh water may spread
out over the entire Okhotsk Sea, and additional fresh water would be carried out from the shelf region
in the form of drifting ice due to strong westerly winter winds.
It should also be noted that Alfultis and Martin's estimation is based on satellite observation of
the coastal polynya, and may include significant error. They assumed that the volume of the dense
water would be doubled by horizontal mixing with the surrounding waters before it reaches the
Oyashio region, and be enough to maintain NPIW. Recent investigations (see Talley and Nagata,
1995), however, indicate the intermediate Oyashio Water will be modified by horizontal mixing with
the old and saline NPIW which is carried by the Kuroshio into the Mixed Water Region (Fujimura and
Nagata, 1992). The volume of water is again doubled before it reaches to the formation area of
NPIW. The rate of the dense water formation in the shelf region of the Okhotsk Sea, which is
required to maintain NPIW, might be much smaller than that estimated by Alfultis and Martin (1987).
If we take the typical salinity values of the Soya Current Water and of the Okhotsk interior
water as 34.0 and 33.0 psu, respectively, the effective salt flux carried into the Okhotsk Sea by the
Soya Current is:
(34.0 - 33.0) x 10-3 Kg/m3 x 0.7 x 106 m3/s = 0.7 x 103 Kg/s. (6)
It should be noted that this effective flux is just in the same order as that produced by ice formation in
the shelf region. The Soya Current Water sinks easily by winter cooling due to its high-salinity nature
(Talley and Nagata, 1995), and appears to influence directly the nature of the water in the intermediate
layers of the Okhotsk Sea.
However, the effective salinity fluxes from and to the North Pacific Ocean through the
northern and southern straits of the Kuril Islands are:
34.1 x 10 -3 Kg/m3 x 13.2 x 106 m3/s = 450 x 103 Kg/s (7a)
and
33.9 x 10"3 Kg/m3 x 16.9 x 106 m3/s = 556 x 103 Kg/s,
(7b)
respectively. The net flux flows out from the Okhotsk Sea to the North Pacific is of order of
100 103 Kg/s, and two orders of magnitude larger than the fluxes discussed above. This means that the
salinity fluxes discussed above do not significantly affect the salinity balance in the whole Okhotsk
Sea, although they are essential for the formation mechanisms of NPIW.
The accuracy of the present discussion would be very limited, but we may conclude:
1. There would be some efficient mechanisms to maintain the salinity value of the surface water in the
shelf region of the north-western Okhotsk Sea. This is essential for the formation of the dense
shelf water which is considered as the source water of NPIW.
2. The vertical tidal mixing in vicinity of the Kashevarova Bank plays an important role to carry back
salt from the shelf bottom layer to the surface layer.
3. The net water mass transport is a very effective way to carry salt, and so we need to estimate
accurately the volume transport of the downwelling associated with the sinking of brine generated
by ice formation.
122
4. The fresh water transport by drifting ice would be important in the salinity balance in the surface
layer of the shelf region.
5. The further discussion on salinity balances in various scales is needed: for the northwestern shelf
region, for the Soya Current Region and the intermediate layers, and for the whole Okhotsk Sea
region.

Variability of the Kuroshio Front in 1965-1991
Alexander D. NELEZIN
Pacific Oceanological Institute, Far Eastern Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences,
Vladivostok, Russia
The northwestern part of the Pacific ocean is characterized by contact of the cold subarctic
and warm subtropical water zones. The Subarctic front, related to the Kuroshio Current, is
distinguished by the enhanced bioproductivity and is one of the fishery regions. Doubtless, the
fisheries' interest promoted the investigation of the front position and properties (Uda, 1938).
The oceanic fronts are revealed by the enhanced horizontal gradients of the characteristics.
The basic frontal zones, or the climatological fronts, are the boundaries of the natural zones in
the ocean. They are identified by the multi-year mean (climatic) charts of the oceanographic
characteristics distribution. By constructing the climatic fields, the relatively wide frontal zone is
charted as a result of the data averaging. This is the region of probable front position
fluctuations.
At the present moment only the sea surface temperature data are widely available for the
study of fronts (Gulev et al., 1988; Rassadnikov et al., 1987), but deep-sea observations should
be performed to analyze the vertical water structure and interannual variability of the front
position.
The vertical temperature sections crossing the Subarctic front were constructed along the
section of 145°E based on multi-year oceanographic data collected in February and August
(Fig. 1). The figure shows that the frontal zone transforms significantly from winter to summer
in the upper oceanic layer of 150 in. Moreover, it is difficult to define the front position in
August in the upper layer, but it is well distinguished in the layer of 150-300 in.
In order to study variability within the annual climatic period, the monthly charts of
multi-year temperature and salinity means were prepared at the standard horizons in the upper
layer of 300 in. The front position was marked on each longitude from 140 to 150°E, and then
the value corresponding to the average front position eastward from the Honshu Island was
calculated. To improve the accuracy of our calculations the characteristic isotherm (isohaline) in
zone of maximal gradients was assumed as a criteria of the front.
The preliminary analysis suggested that the isotherm of 13°C and isohaline of 34.6 % at
the level of 200 in, located in the Kuroshio current zone, are the most informative for the
Subarctic front within the region of 140-150°E. Therefore, for further investigations the term
Kuroshio front was used appropriate to the chosen criteria. The Subarctic front concept is
broader as it includes the Kuroshio and Oyashio Currents and the Mixed Water Region.
The annual variability of the front position (Fig. lc) is characterized by the northeast
displacement in December and by the southeast displacement in April. During the cold period
(December - April) the rapid front displacement southward is observed and then the relatively
smooth fluctuation of its northward movement occurs. Perhaps, it can be explained by some
changes in the variability of the hydrological parameters within the subarctic and subtropical
waters. Southward from the front the semiannual harmonic with maximums in August and
124
February is distinguished, whereas northward the annual harmonic with maximum in December
and minimum in July is revealed.
Interannual front position variations is one of the basic indicators of the ocean
thermodynamic regime, but the shortage of information regarding this problem is obvious. The
opportunity to solve the above problem appeared as a consequence of the Cooperative Study of
Kuroshio (CSK) (The Kuroshio ..., 1972) and the program "Sections" devoted to the monitoring
of the energy active zone of the Kuroshio (Expeditional ..., 1989).
To investigate the multi-year Kuroshio front variability, the mean front position (within
the region of 140-150"E) and standard deviations were calculated using the seasonal mean
temperatures at the level of 200 in from observational data collected in 1965-1991 (Fig. 2). The
isotherm of 13°C was also assumed as a criteria of the front. To perform the analysis of the
interannual variations the smoothing of the temporary data set was carried out applying the
seasonal variation model. To estimate the long-term component the trends were calculated with
the help of the parabolic model. The trends with the opposite tendencies in variations of the
mean front position and standard deviations were interpreted as meandering of the Kuroshio front.
In 1965-1977 a tendency for the front to move northward from 35.5 to 37°N was
observed, then in 1978-1986 the front shifted southward (to 35.2°N) and in the latter period the
inverse shearing to 36.4°N (in 1991) occurred. The Kuroshio front was located in the extreme
north and south positions in the autumn of 1977 (37.6° N) and in the summer of 1986 (34.7°N),
respectively (Fig. 3b). The front meandering decreased in 1965-1977 and increased in 1978-
1985.
The front meandering is a wave of the current track deviation (bending) with a consequent
eddy detachment, and is considered as one of the basic reasons for the spatial front position
variability. Apparently, it is under the influence of quasi-stationary meanders and the Rossby
waves, associated with the non-stationary Kuroshio. The quasi-stationary meanders were well
distinguished by the averaged spatial front positions for all four seasons for the period of study
(Fig. 3a). The greatest meander amplitude was observed in winter, while in the warm period the
front shear became more sloping. The temporal variation analysis suggested the presence of non-
regular processes in the interannual Kuroshio front position variations caused by transfrontal heat
and mass transport, as the stationary frontal divisions play the role of barrier for the sea waters
located on the opposite sides of the front.
To investigate the Kuroshio front position fluctuations the spectral analysis of the
temporal sets along with a preliminary exclusion of the trends was applied. The initial temporal
set, including 105 realizations, was approximated by the model of "piece-wise linear trend" and
divided on three specified sections of the predominant tendencies. After removal of the trend
components the spectra of the residual set were calculated (Fig. 4). The significant interannual
fluctuation periodicity of :5-6 years (at the level of 90%) was obtained for the residual smooth set
of the average front position. It should be noted that previously the temperature anomaly in the
system of the North Pacific circulation with the period of 6 years has been considered and related
to the Polar front shear or the Kuroshio Current axis movement (Kort, 1970). Spectrum based on
the initial set of standard deviations after separating of the trend component had two maximums
corresponding to the periods of 2-3 seasons and about 2 years, respectively.
Multi-year variability of the average front position is under the influence of the water
circulation intensity on the western periphery of the subtropic Pacific gyre. Fig. 4a illustrates the
results of water transport calculations for the North Trade Current and the Kuroshio along the
section of 137°E in 1972-1991. The trends approximated by the parabolic model showed
125
unidirectional tendencies for the currents associated with the long-period variations of the
Kuroshio front position. The running means of the current discharges have been obtained with an
averaging interval of 7 seasons (3, 5 years). Fig. 4b demonstrates the residual curves after the
trend component is separated. As it was noted, in the Kuroshio front variability the extreme
north and south positions were recorded in the autumn of 1977 and in the summer of 1986. This
coincides with the enhanced current intensity in the first mentioned period and weakening of the
current intensity during the second period. The abrupt increase of the current discharges in 1975
-1977 was due to the rapid front shear northward, while the relatively slow decrease of water
transport in 1979-1985 could be explained by a comparatively smooth front shift southward.
Thus, the Kuroshio front movements, to a great extent, are related to the multi-year fluctuations
of the current intensity within the Subtropical gyre.

An Experimental Study of Currents in the Near-Kuril Region of the
Pacific Ocean and in the Okhotsk Sea

INTRODUCTION
Direct current measurements in the main pycnocline of the Pacific and the Okhotsk Sea waters
adjacent to the Kuril Islands are presented and compared with observations of temperature, salinity,
density and dissolved oxygen. These data were collected in July 1993 aboard of RN Academik
Aleksandr Nesmeyanov during the joint expedition organized by the Russian Federal Research Institute
of Fisheries and Oceanography (VNIRO), the Pacific Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography
(TINRO) and the Pacific Oceanological Institute (POI) and supported by the Fisheries Committee of
Russian Federation. Direct current measurements were carried out by Dr. E.P Varlaty, Mrs. M.Y.
Cheranyev and G.P. Shvetsov from POI.
MEASUREMENTS
Current velocity was determined by the acoustic equipment (complex) designed at the Pacific
Oceanological Institute. The equipment and method of measurements were described in details by
Varlaty and Tihomirov (1980), and Varlaty and Ozmidav (1981). Current speed and direction were
detected synchronically by sinking of the acoustic complex from a drifting vessel. The technique used
to measure absolute current parameters included relative velocity sounding and ship drift determination
by any available satellite navigation system. Accuracy of velocity, current direction and depth were
estimated as 0.5 cm/sec, 3" and 0.25%, respectively. Temperature, conductivity, pressure and oxygen
concentration were obtained using Neil Brown MK3 CTD Probe.
A total of 120 stations in the Kuril Islands adjacent areas and the Okhotsk Sea were sampled
during the cruise. On the shelf and over the continental slope CTD and current measurements, as well
as Rosette sampling, were carried out mostly to the near-bottom. Oceanographic stations in deep areas
were taken to a depth of 800-1,000 m
RESULTS
The major patterns of the obtained velocity fields are in agreement with known general
circulation of the Okhotsk Sea and the Pacific Subarctic western boundary area in summer, in
particular, with the current velocity in August (Fig. 1) estimated by geostrophic balance referenced to
2,000 dbar in deep area and to the bottom on the shelf (Moroshkin, 1964). The Kuril (Oyashio)
Current of the Pacific, the :Eastern Sakhalin and the Western Kamchatka Currents over the Okhotsk Sea
continental slope associated with cyclonic gyre in the central part of the Sea were displayed from the
observations.
131
However, the detailed distribution of current velocity demonstrated some specific features and
differences. According to our survey, in July 1993, the jets of the Oyashio Current were situated over
the steep continental slope near the shelf break and in the deeper area over the western slope of the
Kuril Trench. Meandering, branching and eddy generation off the Boussole and Vriez Straits were
typical for the Oyashio Current in summer. The main branch of this Current was located off the Kuril
Islands and deep Straits, that was also characteristic of summer situation. The current velocity module
of the Oyashio decreased from the northeast (0.7-0.8 m/s) to the southwest (0.3-0.4 m/s) due to
disturbances and water exchange through the Straits. In the southwest region the Oyashio turned to the
south-southeast off the Small Southern Kuril Islands (Fig. 2).
At all Pacific stations adjacent to the Kruzenshtern, Boussole and Vriez Straits, streams in the
layer of 0-800 m possessed a major component directed from the Pacific to the Straits (Fig. 2). The
current velocity in this area was 0.4 - 0.8 m/s and its direction demonstrated a good link with bottom
topography. At the same time the total flow in the relatively thick upper layer of the Straits (0-800 m)
was directed to the Okhotsk Sea only in the Kruzenshtern Strait and in the deep channel of the
Boussole Strait adjacent to the Simushir Island shelf slope. The average speed in the Straits was about
0.3-0.4 m/s. In the Okhotsk Sea, along the Kuril Ridge, the current was directed from the northeast to
the southwest (or from Kruzenshtern to Vriez Strait). The major inflow to the Sea of Okhotsk through
the Vriez Strait occured mainly below the depth of 400-500 m in the deep strait channel and gentle
outflow dominated in the upper layer of the Strait.
The dynamic topography (Fig. 3) based on CTD data provided by Verkhunov and Maslennikov
(1993) and Moroshkin's geostrophic currents (Fig. 1) revealed the surface inflow stream through the
Kruzenshtern Strait and surface outflow current through the southwestern part of the Boussole and
Vriez Straits. The current speed in the whole layer of 0-700 m reached maximal values 0.7-0.8 m/s in
the area adjacent to Kruzenshtern Strait. The dominated inflow of the Pacific waters to the Okhotsk
Sea through the Kruzenshtern Strait was confirmed by both direct current measurements (Fig. 2) and
the dynamic topography (Fig. 3), that is in agreement with Leonov (1960) and Moroshkin (1964). The
features described above were characteristic for the summer of 1993 and might be typical for summer
climate in general.
Regularities of the vertical current velocity distribution were also disclosed for the areas with
different water structure, bottom topography and depth. It was shown that the stream current over the
shelf break border on the steep continental slope was at maximum speed in the undersurface layer of
the pycnocline between 200-300 m. This situation was revealed at stations 276 (Fig. 4c), 283 and 287
in the current over the shelf break of the Small Southern Kuril ridge area. A local velocity minimum
was observed in this layer of pycnocline when we move away from the shelf break to the deep offshore
area (station 275, Fig. 4a). The velocity maximum shifted to the surface layer at station 275.
This
phenomenon is related to the vertical and horizontal oscillations of current velocity over the continental
slope and also with jet generation and vertical circulation over the shelf break (Johnson and Manja,
1979, 1982).
The main feature of the vertical current velocity distribution on the northern Okhotsk Sea shelf
was the two layer structure associated with a two layer density profile. Two current velocity maxima
over and under the density interface are typical on the Okhotsk Sea shelf under strong and temperate
wind conditions. In this case the current vector turned right with depth from sea surface to the upper
maximum and left below this maximum towards the density interface, just as in the surface and bottom
planetary boundary layers. In the lower layer the current vector turned in a similar way.
132
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Thus the important features of the horizontal and vertical current velocity distribution in the
main pycnocline of the Kuril adjacent Pacific and in certain areas of the Okhotsk Sea were revealed by
direct current measurements. The acoustic measuring complex of POI could be useful in future
investigations of currents and eddy dynamics.

Hydrographic and Tracer Measurements of the Water Mass Structure
and Transport in the Okhotsk Sea in Early Spring

Russia
In April and May of 1995 a detailed survey of the most important portions of the Okhotsk Sea,
including the Kuril Straits, the Kuril Basin, and northern part of the Okhotsk Sea was undertaken in a
joint USA-Russian expedition aboard the Russian research vessel Akademik Lavrentjev.
Observations
were collected at over 160 stations in the Okhotsk Sea, using
both CTD and Niskin bottle methods,
with all measurements made over the entire water column.
The parameters measured included
temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, chlorofluorocarbons, carbonate
chemistry, and
tritium and helium-3. A map of the expedition location is given in Fig. 1.
Many of the data were
collected close to the ice-edge or in regions where ice had been present only a few days or weeks
before. The resulting data set represents one of the most complete modern surveys of the Okhotsk
Sea
in late winter/early spring conditions.
When plotted on a potential temperature-salinity (0/S) diagram, the CTD data from these
160
stations are suggestive of the regional differences in the character of the water masses of the Okhotsk
Sea, as shown in Fig. 2 (note that these are preliminary data, and some editing is obviously
required).
There are several branches to the main 0/S
manifold in the region 1.0°C < 0 < 3.4°C and 33.0
< S <
34.6. At the lowest temperatures in this region lies the main water of the upper 500 m of the Okhotsk
Sea; at the highest temperature lies the water of the North Pacific Ocean, just outside
Bussol' and
Kruzenshtern Straits. Between these curves lie data from a number of stations that suggest the
complexity of the mixing between the Okhotsk Sea and North Pacific.
It appears that a third water
mass, at potential temperatures somewhere between the general Okhotsk Sea
and the North Pacific, lies
between these extremes and exists as a result of mixing between these two endpoints.
Similar
properties can be seen in many of the chemical tracers collected on the expedition.
It is suggested that
the main mechanism responsible for this third curve is tidal mixing through the Kuril Straits.
At the highest densities in the Okhotsk Sea the water mass characteristics are asymptotically
similar to the deep water of the North Pacific Ocean. This is due to the fact that the deepest entrance
to the Okhotsk Sea is through Bussol' Strait, at a depth of 2,200 in. At depths greater than
this within
the Okhotsk Sea, in the Kuril Basin, there is no other apparent source of water.
Stated differently,
although the surface waters of the Okhotsk Sea in winter are among the coldest anywhere in the world
ocean, there is no evidence of the occurrence of deep convection within
the Okhotsk Sea. The
dissolved oxygen concentrations and chlorofluorocarbon ratios in the deepest portions of the
Kuril
Basin (not shown) appears to preclude this possibility. The chlorofluorocarbon measurements suggest
that the deepest waters of the Kuril Basin have not been exposed to the sea surface for 30-50 years,
although waters above 1,000 m in the Sea appear to have been ventilated in the past 15 years.
In
general, the vertical distribution of these variables inside the Okhotsk Sea is quite different from the
North Pacific, suggesting that vertical mixing is much stronger inside the Okhotsk Sea, perhaps again
due to enhanced tidal activity.
138
At the lowest potential temperatures in the Okhotsk Sea (0 < 0°C) two main masses of water
appear to be present, both formed near the sea surface during the winter, both having some expression
close to the freezing point of seawater. At the lowest salinities (< 32.7) and densities (oe < 26.4), the
remnants of melting ice can be seen. At somewhat higher salinities (> 33.0) and densities (ce> 26.5) a
second general water mass appears at these cold temperatures. This is the water discussed by Dr.
Kitani that is formed by brine rejection under ice shelves. Almost all of this type of water was
observed in the northwest Okhotsk Sea, off the northern coast of Sakhalin Island. Taken together,
these measurements allow us to make better estimates of the water mass characteristics of the Okhotsk
Sea, the residence time of water in the Sea, and the mechanisms that lead to the distributions of these
water masses.
A central goal of this expedition was to examine the nature of the flow through the main
passages between the Kuriles and the North Pacific, Bussol' Strait and Kruzenshtern Strait. A CTD
section across Bussol' Strait was carried out twice
over a 3-day period, and a section across
Kruzenshtern Strait was run three times over
a 2-day period. The repeat times of these sections were
chosen to attempt to minimize effects of tidal aliasing.
Potential temperature sections across Bussol'
Strait are shown in Fig. 3; from the data it
can clearly be seen that there is a great deal of change in
the subsurface temperature field in Bussol' Strait over time scales of a day or two. Note especially the
apparent warming in the western portion of the strait between section 1 and section 2 and the apparent
cooling near the central portion of the strait,
near the major topographic feature, also between section 1
and section 2. These changes suggest that there is
a great deal of tidal energy present at the straits and
that the flow near the straits changes on quite short time scales. With this in mind, it is suggested that
it will in general be quite difficult to determine the low-frequency (i.e., geostrophic) flow through
these straits with any acceptable degree of accuracy in the absence of a dedicated program to carry out
direct measurements of currents in the straits for times of a few years or more.

INTRODUCTION
Significant transformation of the subarctic water from the northern part of the Okhotsk Sea
occurs in the Kuril Basin. Using satellite and a few CTD observations Alfultis and Martin (1987) and
Wakatsuchi and Martin (1991) disclosed the anticyclonic circulation in the Kuril Basin in contrast with
the large cyclonic Okhotsk Sea gyre by which cold northern shelf waters propagate to the Basin. The
detailed synoptic structure of the Kuril Basin is studied insufficiently due to very sparse surveys.
In the present work we describe observations obtained in August 1994 during the cruise of the
RV "Akademik M.A. Lavrentyev" and demonstrate that anticyclonic circulation in the Kuril Basin
constitutes the chain of three anticyclonic eddies with their centers located along the axis of the Basin.
Significant water mass transformation and mixing were revealed inside these eddies. Strong inflow of
the Pacific warm intermediate waters to the Okhotsk Sea has been detected above 500 dbar (with
geostrophic transport through the Boussole Strait of 9.8.106 m3/s), while outflow from the Okhotsk Sea
has been found at pressure below 750 dbar.
METHOD OF OBSERVATIONS
CTD survey has been conducted in the period from July 26 to August 26, 1994, using NBMK3
instrumentation. Guildline model 8737 probe provided by the Institute of Ocean Sciences (Sidney,
B.C., Canada) and calibrated at IOS just before the cruise was used for inter-comparison of the data.
RESULTS
Fig. 1 shows the geopotential anomaly and geostrophic currents at 200 dbar relative to 1,000
dbar for the Kuril Basin area. Three anticyclonic eddies with diameters of 125-300 km in the Okhotsk
Sea and one off Boussole Strait are clearly seen. The position of the eddy centers coincide with the
Kuril Basin axis, similar to the Kuril Islands anticyclonic rings, which axis lies along the Kuril-
Kamchatka trench. The Okhotsk Sea eddies of the Kuril Basin separate cold intermediate waters from
the northwest Okhotsk Sea and warm intermediate waters penetrating through the Boussole Strait. The
dynamic heights for the Kuril Basin anticyclonic eddies are higher than those in the center of the
Boussole ring and have maximum value for the western ring of 12.5 J/kg. The lower boundary of the
cold intermediate layer changes from 150 m within the Oyashio to 950 m in the center of the western
anticyclone, the biggest eddy of the survey (Fig.2).
144
Geostrophic transport to the Okhotsk Sea
Recently, Stabeno and Reed (1994) evaluated geostrophic transport through the Aleutian
Straits. A similar approach was used in the present work to calculate geostrophic transport (relative to
1,000 dbar) for the Kuril Straits area. We found that transport by the First Oyashio Branch
(southward transport to the west of the Boussole ring) was 9.2.106 m3/s, while total transport through
the section across the Oyashio First Branch and anticyclonic eddy was 10.4.106 m3/s. The transport
through the Boussole Strait to the Okhotsk Sea has been computed as 9.8.106 m3/s. These data
contradict the earlier estimations of geostrophic outflow through the Boussole Strait (Reid, 1973).
However, despite the uncertainties of geostrophic transport calculations for the Strait area, we assume
that the direction of flow reflects the propagation of warm intermediate waters to the Okhotsk Sea.
This penetration is clearly seen in the temperature and salinity profiles (Fig. 3).
Penetration of warm intermediate layer to the Okhotsk Sea
A warm intermediate layer to the east of the Kuril Islands was observed at 200-700 dbar. Its
maximum
temperature was 3.55°C at 300 dbar on station 86. Warm layer with temperature of 3.54°C
was also found at 500 dbar on station 82 in the canyon of the Boussole Strait. Simultaneously, water
with temperature from 2.6 to 2.68°C was revealed at the other side of the Boussole Strait in the
Okhotsk Sea on stations 94 and 95 at 650 dbar. It was the highest temperature of the intermediate
waters in the Okhotsk Sea in the area of study. Salinity in the warm core continuously decreased from
33.983 psu (station 86 at 300 dbar) and 33.987 psu (station 82 at 500 dbar) to 33.840 psu (station 94 at
650 dbar) and 33.903 psu (station 95 at 650 dbar). It appears that warm intermediate water penetrates
through the Strait deepening gradually from 300 dbar to 650 dbar between station 86 and stations 94-
95. Abrupt changes which lead to the temperature and salinity decrease were detected within the
Boussole Strait.
Okhotsk water outflow through the Boussole Strait
Our observations in the Boussole Strait canyon (station 82) strictly demonstrated a four-layer
vertical water structure (Fig. 4): the surface warm layer (at pressure less than 100 dbar); the cold
intermediate
layer (typical for summer) with the core at 100 dbar; the warm intermediate subarctic
layer (with distinct boundaries at pressures of 450 and 780 dbar) characterized by temperature higher
than 3.2°C and salinity over 34.0 psu. However, the most interesting feature of the vertical structure
is the
lower layer of water which is relatively cold (< 2.3°C), fresh and rich in oxygen. A very sharp
dropping of salinity and temperature, as well as an increasing of oxygen concentration take place at a
pressure of 780 dbar. Comparison of TS diagrams for stations 82 and 94-97 shows that water of this
layer originates from the Okhotsk Sea, i.e. below the warm intermediate layer the TS diagram of
station 82
coincides with those in the Okhotsk Sea. Note, that Okhotsk Sea waters in TS diagrams are
obviously separated from the Oyashio and Kamchatka current waters with its lower temperature and
higher salinity at maximum temperature. Hence, the gap between TS-curves for ocean and Okhotsk
Sea stations is evident. Similar signs of the Okhotsk Sea outflow were observed at station 85,
however, at station 82 they were more pronounced. The reason could be that this particular station is
located exactly in the Boussole Strait canyon.
The CTD results are confirmed by the oxygen bottle data. The Okhotsk Sea water is
characterized by high oxygen saturation (up to 15% at pressure of 1,000 dbar) and the absence of an
oxygen minimum within the Boussole Strait at pressures less than 1,000 dbar. Meanwhile, oxygen
minimum with saturation below 10% and absolute values less than 0.7 ml/l (station 80) exists in the
145
ocean to the east of the Strait at pressures of 700-850 dbar. Therefore, oxygen
concentration of 1.32-
1.69 m1/1 and saturation of 17-22% at 800-1000 dbar detected at station 82 clearly prove that these
waters have originated from the Okhotsk Sea.
Two stations were taken in the Boussole Strait canyon in April 1995, during the joint Russian-
USA expedition to the Okhotsk Sea on board of the RV
"Akademik M.A. Lavreryev",
in which the first
co-author participated.
These results (not shown here and kindly provided by Dr. S. Riser from the
University of Washington and Dr. G. Yurasov from the Pacific Oceanological Institute) definitely
indicate the gap between TS-curves for stations at the opposite sides of the Boussole Strait, similar
with 1994 data. In particular, vertical structure at station 23 in the Boussole Strait canyon was similar
to station 82 (August 1994): cold and relatively fresh layer with high oxygen concentration was
found
below the warm intermediate layer at pressure 800 dbar. Thickness of this layer was greater than
400
dbar and its thermohaline characteristics coincide with the Okhotsk Sea waters.
Talley (1991) described unusually cold, fresh and rich-oxygen water with sigma-theta of 27.4
at pressure of 800 dbar, observed off the Boussole Strait in August 1985.
Isopycnal maps allow the
conclusion that this water has an Okhotsk Sea origin.
The only station considered by Talley (1991)
shows an anomaly of temperature, salinity and oxygen in the layer of 100 in thickness, which is much
less than during our survey.
It can be explained by the greater distance of this station from the Strait,
as compared with our station 82 in August 1994. Moreover, anomalies
of temperature and salinity
with respect to neighboring waters reached 0.2-0.5°C and 0.07 psu in 1985, whereas anomalies
of
0.84°C, 0.08 and 1 ml/1 for temperature, salinity and oxygen were revealed in 1994.
Therefore, these observations permit the assumption of the regular outflow from the Okhotsk
Sea through the Boussole Strait at pressure below 800 dbar and inflow of warm subarctic waters
through this Strait at 300-700 dbar.

North Pacific Intermediate Water Formation
and the Role of the Okhotsk Sea
Lynne D. TALLEY
Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego, U.S.A.
The following is an extended abstract of a talk which was presented on NPIW, with emphasis
on how the salinity minimum forms in the Mixed Water Region. A more general talk,
which included
more emphasis on the role of the Okhotsk Sea, was presented separately. Because this is an
extended
abstract, the references are greatly truncated and include primarily my own work.
More complete
references can be found in those publications.
LARGE-SCALE PROPERTIES OF NORTH PACIFIC INTERMEDIATE WATER
North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) can be defined as either the salinity
minimum of the
subtropical gyre of the North Pacific, at a potential density of 26.7 to 26.8 sigma-theta, or as the
subtropical layer which is freshened by subpolar water with a potential density range of about 26.65 to
27.6. The subtropical gyre's salinity minimum is evident in any vertical section of salinity which
crosses it.
The NPIW salinity minimum should be carefully differentiated from the shallower salinity
minima which are found in the eastern and tropical North Pacific, and from the Antarctic Intermediate
Water (AAIW) found in the tropical Pacific, because their sources differ from that of NPIW. The
shallower salinity minima, arrayed around the eastern subtropical gyre, arise from subduction of
surface waters as they move southward and encounter less dense surface waters (Talley, 1983; Yuan
and Talley, 1992). Antarctic Intermediate Water comes from the south and is found up to the southern
boundary of the subtropical gyre, although there is some controversy about whether the salinity
minimum in the North Pacific's tropical region really derives more from NPIW than from AAIW.
The NPIW salinity minimum is found only in the subtropical gyre (Sverdrup et al., 1942;
Talley, 1993) although isopycnal properties show that its low salinity clearly arises in the subpolar
region (Reid, 1965; Talley, 1993). Its northern and southern boundaries are well-defined and coincide
respectively with a deep expression of the Subarctic Front and the southern side of the subtropical
circulation, which is relatively far to the north at the NPIW depth.
Its eastern boundary is less easy to
define, but the eastern Pacific's California Current is a region of multiple or
missing salinity minima,
and it appears that intact NPIW does not extend into this region (Talley, 1993).
The NPIW's salinity minimum has a density of 26.7 to 26.9 sigma-theta in the
subtropical
Pacific (Fig. 1 from Talley, 1993). Where a portion of the NPIW protrudes southward along the
western boundary in the Mindanao Current, it appears to be truncated from below and its density can
be lower (Bingham and Lukas, 1994). In the Mixed Water Region (MWR) between the separated
Kuroshio and Oyashio, NPIW salinity minima are found in this full range of densities;
the denser
minima have higher salinity and lower oxygen and are apparently old NPIW which has entered the
MWR from the Kuroshio. The lighter minima are
considered here and in Talley et at. (1995) to be the
newest NPIW.
150
If low salinity and high oxygen are considered to indicate the most recently-ventilated NPIW,
then the region of newest NPIW is the northwestern subtropical gyre, in the MWR, based on salinity
and oxygen distribution at the NPIW salinity minimum (Talley, 1993). Away from this location of
new NPIW, salinity increases, probably due to vertical diffusion and possibly horizontal diffusion
along the eastern and southern sides of the gyre; oxygen decreases due to consumption and diffusion.
The highest NPIW salinity is found in the southwestern subtropical gyre and in the Kuroshio and
Mindanao Currents. Lowest oxygen is found in these regions as well.
CIRCULATION AND TRANSFORMATION IN THE OKHOTSK SEA
In the wintertime, surface densities in the open North Pacific do not exceed approximately
26.65 sigma-theta except in very localized coastal regions. Even these small regions around Hokkaido
and northern Honshu do not ventilate water much denser than 26.7 sigma-theta. What is the source of
fresh, oxygenated water at densities greater than 26.65 sigma-theta?
It appears that the source is the
Okhotsk Sea, and results from direct ventilation of densities 26.6 to 27.2 sigma-theta. On isopycnals
which intersect the NPIW salinity minimum, it is clear that the highest oxygen and lowest salinity are
found in the Okhotsk Sea (Talley, 1991; hints of this in Reid, 1965, 1972). In fact, the highest
oxygen, suggestive of the most recent ventilation are found in the Okhotsk Sea for all densities from
26.7 to 27.6 sigma-theta, which is the density at the greatest sill depth separating the Okhotsk Sea and
the NW Pacific.
The lowest salinities for this density range and even lower are also found in the
Okhotsk Sea. Thus one concludes that the Okhotsk Sea is the site for the densest ventilation impacting
isopycnals in the open North Pacific.
(While deep water is formed in the Japan Sea, its dense waters
do not connect with the open North Pacific.)
Most of the Okhotsk Sea ventilation occurs under sea ice in winter. Winter surface density in
open water in the Okhotsk Sea does not appear to much exceed 26.7 sigma-theta, even though waters
are clearly ventilated to much greater densities. Brine rejection is a very effective mechanism for
increasing the density of near-freezing surface water.
Dense, cold water has been observed on the
shelves of the northern and western Okhotsk Sea (Kitani, 1973). Based on water properties in the
western Okhotsk Sea, it appears that the brine rejection mechanism might be operative to a maximum
density of about 27.2 sigma-theta (Talley, 1991). Because this mechanism deposits a very cold water
on denser isopycnals, this water is also the freshest on those isopycnals, although there is a net flux of
salt downward.
The Okhotsk Sea also contains the North Pacific's freshest, most oxygenated water at densities
greater than 27.2 sigma-theta.
Based on isopycnal salinity and oxygen distributions, Talley (1991)
hypothesized that the principal mechanism for this "ventilation" is vertical mixing primarily within the
Okhotsk Sea, and operating most vigorously close to Bussol' Strait. Bussol' Strait is the deepest
passage through the Kuril Islands, with a sill depth of 2300 meters, and sill density of about 27.6
sigma-theta.
This argument is a refinement of Reid's (1965) argument that vertical diffusion in the
North Pacific carries the low salinity surface signature downward - the refinement is to suggest that
much of the vertical diffusion is localized.
Moroshkin (1966) concluded that there is a great deal of
mixing in the Kuril Straits. The primary mechanism for mixing might be tidal flows, which are on the
order of 4-5 knots near the surface through the various straits.
In the following few paragraphs the circulation and transformation in the Okhotsk Sea are
reviewed; a much more complete review can be found in the PICES Scientific Report on the Okhotsk
Sea (Talley and Nagata, 1995).
151
The Okhotsk Sea is
the northwesternmost region of the subpolar gyre (Fig. 2). Much of it is
ice-covered in winter, although the ice melts away completely each summer.
It is connected to the
open North Pacific through the Kuril Island chain, and so the subpolar circulation
which enters the
Okhotsk Sea must do so through island passages. The two most important passages are Bussol' and
Kruzenshtern Straits. Part of the East Kamchatka Current, flowing southward out of the Bering Sea,
enters the Okhotsk Sea, and part remains outside. Some of the western boundary current
might also
enter at Bussol' Strait which is also the primary site of the denser outflow.
The outflow turns
southwestward and becomes the Oyashio. The net exchange between the open North Pacific and the
Okhotsk Sea is on the order of 3-5 Sv, although a very good estimate is not possible
using available
data.
Within the Okhotsk Sea, the flow is basically cyclonic, but eddy activity
is prominent, as are
local gyres. In this sense it resembles the Bering Sea, which is also separated by an island chain from
the open Pacific. Local circulation features in the Okhotsk Sea which appear to be important for water
mass transformation are the northern shelf region where coastal polynyas are
often found, Kashevarov
Bank around which there is commonly intensified cyclonic flow and above which there is
upwelling,
the East Sakhalin Current which transports dense, ventilated waters southward from the northern
shelf
region, the Soya Current which transports saline
Japan Sea water into the Okhotsk Sea, and an
anticyclonic gyre and anticyclonic eddy field in the Kuril Basin which spreads the
saline Soya Current
waters into the Okhotsk Sea.
Two important physical elements for dense water formation in the Okhotsk
Sea are the input of
saline water in the Soya Current, which preconditions the Okhotsk Sea to forming denser water, and
sea ice formation which produces dense shelf water through brine rejection.
Sea ice forms along the
northwestern boundary in December and eventually covers most of the northern and western parts
of
the sea. A coastal polynya appears in mid-winter along the northwestern side; observations
of the
densest, saline waters have been along this shelf.
Kitani (1973) observed shelf water at nearly 27.05
sigma-theta, and showed that the very coldest waters in the summer temperature minimum,
indicative
of freezing in winter, were located in the northwestern Okhotsk Sea.
The exception is above
Kashevarov Bank, where strong tides mix the warmer deep water upwards; a polynya is usually
found
in this location in winter. Since the surface waters in the coastal polynya are probably
near freezing, it
is more likely to produce the densest water than would the Kashevarov polynya, whose waters are
relatively warm.
The dense waters formed in the northern Okhotsk Sea are advected southwards in the East
Sakhalin Current and then over towards Bussol' Strait, based on isopycnic properties (Talley,
1991).
Strong tides are found around the Kuril Islands, including in Bussol' Strait. These produce a mixed
water around the islands (Kawasaki, these proceedings;
Kawasaki and Kono, 1993) which includes
components of waters from outside the Kurils and which is also vertically mixed, so
that the water
which leaves the Okhotsk Sea is not pure Okhotsk Sea water.
The newly-ventilated and mixed
Okhotsk Sea waters join waters from the East Kamchatka Current and flow southwestward
towards
Hokkaido.
FORMATION OF THE NPIW SALINITY MINIMUM IN THE MIXED WATER REGION
The ventilated water from the Okhotsk Sea exits primarily through
Bussol' Strait and joins the
southward flow of the Oyashio towards Hokkaido. The Oyashio separates from the western boundary
at the southern end of Hokkaido and flows eastward. It typically meanders at least twice, in well-
known locations, after it separates (e.g. Kawai, 1972). Some of the Oyashio
water separates off and
remains in the MWR while the remainder circulates eastward as part of the subpolar gyre circulation.

The MWR occupies an interesting dynamical niche in the North Pacific's gyre circulations. First, it is
bounded to the north and south by vigorous, meandering separated boundary currents, which spawn
"rings" or "intrusions" into the MWR, so it is a mixing region between Oyashio and Kuroshio waters.
(A third source of water for the region is flow from the Japan Sea through Tsugaru Strait, which
affects the uppermost density layers, and introduces extra salinity which preconditions the MWR to
have higher winter surface densities, on the order of 26.65 sigma-theta [Talley, 1991].) Second, the
MWR is part of the subtropical gyre in terms of Sverdrup transport but it is also a region of Ekman
upwelling; these can coexist because of the southwest-northeast tilt of the zero of Ekman pumping over
the whole North Pacific (Yuan and Talley, 1992).
The complexity of the MWR is evident in any depiction of water properties in the region.
Analyses of temperature at 100 meters are produced monthly by the Japan Meteorological Association;
an example during April, 1989 (selected because it was the period chosen for Talley et al.'s [1995]
CTD analysis) shows an intrusion of cold water of Oyashio origin down the coast of Honshu, a patch
of warm water east of Hokkaido at the usual location between the first two Oyashio "intrusion" or
meanders and warm water originating from Tsugaru Strait. CTD sections are occupied regularly along
144°E and show the wall of the Kuroshio, often a warm core ring to its north, and the more density-
compensated signature of the Oyashio (e.g. Talley et al., 1995). NPIW is found as a salinity minimum
south of the Oyashio front; on the sections which we analyzed it was in almost pure form in the
Kuroshio warm core ring.
Temperature / salinity profiles in the MWR away from the near-coastal regions can be
classified in four to five relatively well-defined categories (Talley et al., 1995): Kuroshio (subtropical)
water, Oyashio (subpolar) water, Tsugaru Water, and one or two classes of mixed water (subtropical
and subpolar transitional water), in which the upper part of the T/S relation is dominated by Kuroshio
water', the middle by the mixture of Oyashio and Kuroshio water, and the lower by either Kuroshio or
Oyashio water. A salinity minimum occurs in all but Oyashio water. The subtropical transitional
water is considered to contain the "new" NPIW. A map of the MWR in April, 1989 plus earlier
sections at 152°E shows new NPIW in patches through the MWR west of 144°E and completely
dominating the MWR by 152°E. Using the definition of the subtropical transitional water as the new
NPIW, and assuming primarily isopycnal processes on a large scale, we find that new NP1W is
composed of about 45% Oyashio water and 55% Kuroshio water (Talley et al., 1995). This ratio
breaks down at densities lower than 26.65 sigma-theta, suggesting that much less Oyashio water is
available at lower densities.
New NPIW is therefore formed when the ventilated, freshened Oyashio waters encounter the
older, more saline waters of the Kuroshio; their mixture creates a salinity minimum. What sets the
density of the actual minimum? The density of new NPIW is slightly greater than 26.7 sigma-theta.
The surface density in winter in most of the Oyashio and northern Mixed Water Region achieves 26.65
regularly, implying a steady and large source of newly ventilated water at this density. At a few small
coastal patches density greater than 26.7 is achieved but they do not seem to produce enough water to
influence the density of the NPIW. A density of 26.7 sigma-theta is also clearly denser than most
surface water even in the open Okhotsk Sea in winter.
The robustness of the NPIW density after formation, and its nearness to the Oyashio winter
surface density suggests that winter surface density is important, but there must also be a density-
increasing mechanism.
The obvious candidates are cabbeling and double diffusion. Cabbeling is
obviously most effective when the source waters are very different, as they are in the MWR. It is easy
to show that a mixture of Oyashio and Kuroshio waters of approximately 45%:55% can produce a
density increase of about 0.06 sigma-theta, which is clearly enough to increase the density of the
Oyashio's winter surface water to greater than 26.7 sigma-theta after it mixes with Kuroshio water
153
(Fig. 1). Therefore our hypothesis is that the NPIW salinity minimum density is set by:
(1) intrusion
of Oyashio waters into Kuroshio waters, with the largest volume of Oyashio water near the
surface
being at its winter mixed layer density, and (2) mixing/cabbeling of these waters.
How much NPIW is formed? In order to answer this, the question needs to be better posed.
It
can mean either how much ventilation occurs in the NPIW
density range (i.e., how much surface water
is converted to water in some specified density range each year), or it can mean how water of this
density range enters the subtropical gyre from the subpolar gyre each year? In Talley et al. (1995) we
answered the latter question, using a density range of 26.65-27.4 sigma-theta. Subsequent
calculations
have modified the estimates published in that paper. We used two ways to estimate the exchange
of
Oyashio water into the subtropical gyre:
(1) calculating the eastward transport of new NPIW and the
amount of pure Oyashio water included in the new NPIW across 152°E south of the
subarctic front,
and (2) estimating the amount of Kuroshio water which enters the MWR based on the average
number
of warm core rings formed each year. Using transports across 152°E (and also 165°E and
175°E), we
found that 6.1Sv of new NPIW were moving eastward between the subarctic front and the
Kuroshio;
thus there were 2.7Sv of Oyashio water included in this.
NORTHWEST PACIFIC TRANSPORT BALANCES
A much better-posed question than the formation rate of "new NPIW" is:
what is the total
transport of Oyashio water into the subtropical gyre.
Since the Kuroshio itself begins to incorporate
the new NPIW immediately after it separates from Honshu, and the freshening then begins to
spread
into the Kuroshio recirculation to the south, a complete estimate of the total of new NPIW must
include the Kuroshio and its recirculation.
At this point it becomes difficult to define "new NPIW"
since various mixtures of old and new are involved. Using the same 152°E sections as in Talley et
al.
(1995), a new estimate of the total amount of Oyashio water being transported eastward south
of the
subarctic front is 4-5 Sv.
The total Oyashio transport east of Hokkaido is on the order of 10-15 Sv in the upper
1,000
meters. Therefore 5-10 Sv remain in the subarctic gyre while 4-5 Sv cross into the
subtropical gyre.
A schematic of upper layer transports through the northwestern Pacific, including exchanges
with and
transformations in the Okhotsk Sea, and the transport of Oyashio water into the subtropical gyre
is
shown in Fig. 2. Various estimates of the East Kamchatka Current transport in the upper 1,000 meters
yield 15-25 Sv (Talley and Nagata, 1995).
Approximately 3-5 Sv enter and circulate through the
Okhotsk Sea, in which approximately 1 Sv of surface water is transformed into water in the
NPIW
density range. The Oyashio carries about 10-15 Sv southward.
Thus approximately 1/4 of the
Oyashio transport is cycled through the Okhotsk Sea, and of this about 1/4 is new dense water.
The
ventilation time scale for the subpolar gyre, based on the 1 Sv transformation in the Okhotsk Sea,
is on
the order of several decades. This seems rather long, and hence the total ventilation rate
is probably
underestimated. Study of these balances is continuing.

Seasonal Variability of Integral Water Circulation
in the Okhotsk Sea

INTRODUCTION
The Okhotsk Sea represents the marginal sea and is separated from the Pacific Ocean by the
Kuril Islands and Kamchatka Peninsula, and from the Japan Sea by Sakhalin and Hokkaido
Islands.
Out of all Far-Eastern Seas the Okhotsk Sea extends farthest into the continent and thus
is more
influenced by continental conditions.
Characteristic morphometric peculiarity of the Sea is the vast
shelf which occupies more than 40% of its area. The water exchange between the Okhotsk Sea and the
Pacific Ocean is determined by the sizes and depths of the Kuril Islands straits.
In the Kuril Islands
Ridge there are more than 30 straits with total width about 500 km. The widest and deepest straits are
those of Bussol' (the sill depth is 2,318 m and 43.3% of the total width), Kruzenshtern (1,920 m
and
24.4%), Freez (900 m and 9.2%) and the Fourth Kuril Strait (600 m and 8.1 %). Although the
straits
are rather deep, even the Bussol' Strait is 1.5 km shallower than the
Kuril Basin. The deep water
exchange with the ocean is thus restricted. The Okhotsk Sea is connected with the Japan Sea
through
the shallow strait of La Perouse (the sill depth of 75 m and width of 44 km) and the passage
of
Nevel'skoy (the sill depth of 14 m and width of 7 km).
Thermochaline structure of the Okhotsk Sea waters is conditioned on the one hand by the
intensive water exchange with the Pacific Ocean and, on the other hand, by the strong convective
mixing and ice formation during autumn-winter period of the year.
Investigation of the Okhotsk Sea currents started some time ago (Luchin, 1987;
Moroshkin,
1966). Most of the known water circulation schemes has been obtained either by the dynamic method
with the limited array of the initial data (Moroshkin, 1966) or as a result of diagnostic calculations
based on the linear diagnostic model of Sarkisyan (1977) using available water density
information and
atmospheric pressure fields (Luchin, 1982, 1987). In addition, numerical simulations of currents have
been executed applying the simplified baroclinic or barotropic models (Kozlov, 1972; Sekine,
1990).
To investigate the synoptic variability of the Okhotsk Sea currents numerical experiments were
performed based on meteorological and CTD observations, and in situ current velocity measurements
aboard the RN Akademik Alexander Nesmeyanov in September 1993 (Vasiliev and Khrapshenkov,
1994). Seasonal variability of currents has been studied using both the diagnostic Sarkisyan's
model
for the warm period of the year (Luchin, 1987) and the model of the Novosibirsk Computer Center
which takes account of the density stratification (Martynov et al., 1995).
MODEL DESCRIPTION AND INITIAL DATA
The quasigeostrophic model based on principles of self-similarity of the second order was used
to reconstruct the sea water circulation by months.
It considered spatial distribution of water density,
atmospheric effect, bottom topography and coastline, water exchange through the straits,
and
158
b - effect.
The sea water density was taken as the function possessing the natural self-similarity (similarity
of the vertical distribution):
p(x,y,z,t) = (x,y,t)[a(z,t) + aa(x,y,t)(z-hd )J+d'(x,y,t), (1)
'06(Z, t)I
Oatzha, a(x,y,t)=- z=H;
where a, _
1atz>ha,
, x y't)=
c9(x, ,t)=0;
Here, p (x, y, z, t)
is spatial-temporal distribution of the sea water density; pP(x, y, t) is known sea
surface density; a(z, t) is stratification function; a(x, y, t) is discrete-constant function regulating
zero flux through the bottom; he'- is depth of the near-bottom layer of Ekman friction; (x, y, t) is
self-similarity function; x, y, z
are coordinates, corresponding to the axes directed eastward,
northward or vertically down; t is time, and R is an index related to a characteristic station of the
studied region, corresponding to the average vertical distribution of the sea water density.
In a quasistationary statement, computation of currents and density distribution from the
tangential stress of wind and surface density leads to the equation for the transport stream function V:
-o'P+O'P=F(T,p°,f);
lPL
= T
K
(2)
where L is basin contour;
T is tangential stress of the wind; pP sea surface density; v is
relaxation parameter;
f is the errors function related to some additional conditions on surface current
velocities (Vasiliev, 1993).
Bringing in the additional conditions
on surface current velocities allows calculation of the
vertical distribution of currents and components of net fluxes both inside the area and on the liquid
margin. Moreover, it permits derivation of the
errors function resulting from the need to satisfy the
discontinuity equation and water balance in the region. Equation (2) is solved by the method of
minimal errors (Marchuk, 1.974) by way of reaching a steady state in the time interval corresponding to
the period of averaging marginal and surface conditions. The explicit solution of the equation provides
the gradients of self-similarity function, the self-similarity function itself,
sea water density, level
inclinations, and horizontal and vertical distribution of currents.
A more detailed mathematical statement of the problem and the model description are given in
(Vasiliev, 1993, 1994; Vasiliev and Dudka, 1994; Vasiliev and Khrapchenkov, 1994). The model
has been used for the numerical experiments
on dynamic studies in the Northwestern Pacific (Vasiliev,
1993, 1994; Vasiliev and Dudka, 1994; Vasiliev and Khrapchenkov, 1994).
The input data to calculate the integral circulation of the Okhotsk Sea included the real
atmospheric pressure fields corresponding to the monthly predominant type of the atmospheric
processes (Polyakova, 1994), the average monthly fields of temperature and seasonal surface salinity
fields, as well as the monthly averaged stratification function in
a characteristic point of the Sea. A
uniform mesh with a width of 30' in latitude and longitude, and standard vertical horizons was used for
calculations. The ice formation was considered in winter
season, but the direct effect of wind was not
taken into account for the ice covered
area.. Current velocities were determined by the explicit
formula, after solving the problem relative
to the flow function. Characteristics of the atmospheric
influence on the sea surface were computed based
on the half-empirical ratios. Discharges in the
159
straits were either given according to the estimates available (Kozlov, 1972;
Luchin, 1982, 1987;
Zyryanov, 1974, 1977) or determined from the net fluxes normal to the liquid boundaries of the area,
considered while using the given stratification function and the influence function obtained in the
solution. The water exchange through the Tartar Strait was not considered. Numerical realization of
the model was performed using the method of minimal errors (Marchuk, 1974).
RESULTS
Results of the numerical experiments by months are given in Fig. 1. The cyclonic character of
waters circulation, pointed out by many authors studying the Okhotsk Sea currents, was confirmed
only for the northern part of the Sea and only for the warm period of the year.
A series of not
unidirectional gyres which change their sizes and relative location in time was revealed in the southern
part of the Sea.
One of the most stable currents of the Okhotsk Sea, namely the East Sakhalin Current, was
observed near the eastern coast of Sakhalin Island.
Its characteristics, conditioned by the seasonal
variability of the atmospheric circulation over the Sea, demonstrated essential temporal changes.
During the autumn-winter period (August to May) the current was traced everywhere along the
Sakhalin coast. The discharge and velocities were maximal for this season, and reached 1-1.5 Sv and
more than 35 cm/s in October. In June-July the current was detected only in the southern part of the
Sakhalin coast. Similar changes occurred in the Counter Current, a part of which together with the
East-Sakhalin Current forms a cyclonic gyre to the east of Sakhalin Island, and the other part forms the
anticyclonic gyre in the central part of the Okhotsk Sea. This dipole structure was well expressed on
the maps from October to May, and practically was unobserved in December and June-September,
while forming the more complex structures of different vorticity. The maximal discharges and current
velocities (more than 2 S and 40 cm/s correspondingly) were found in the Counter Current and in the
anticyclonic gyre in October.
The North Okhotsk Current of small speed was traced during the warm season and practically
vanished for the cold half of the year. This is related probably to generation of the ice cover.
The Kamchatka Current was revealed from January to September, and its
core moved
gradually (from winter to summer) to the western coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula. For some months
we observed the current bifurcation into the northern branch passing to Penzhinsky Gulf and the
western branch taking part in the cyclonic gyre to the west of the south-western coast of Kamchatka.
The maximal velocities of the Kamchatka Current (exceeded 20 cm/s at 52°N) occurred in November-
December. The compensating current near the western coast of Kamchatka was not seen, as it passed
on the shelf with water depths less than 100 m. Only in November and December weak flow (with
velocities not more than 5 cm/s) directed southward was found near the coast on the section along
52°N.
The Soya Current, with varying level of intensity, was observed during the whole year.
In
winter it fell into two and sometimes three branches, one of which moved along the coast of Hokkaido
Island, the second turned to the north-east, and the last one passed to the east. Both eastward branches
were involved into the anticyclonic gyre which shifted to the southern part of the sea in January-
February. From June to December, the Soya Current was well manifested as the flow passing along
the Hokkaido coast, whereas in July-August and December it turned to the north (not reaching Siretoko
Cape) and propagated between two gyres of different vorticity up to the Strait of Freez.
In
September-November, the main Soya Current branch extended from Siretoko Cape along Kunashir
Island as far as the Strait of Freez where it divided into two branches: one of them passed to the
160
Pacific Ocean through the Strait, another one moved to the north while participating in the anticyclonic
gyre.
A series of gyres characterized by different signs of vorticity
was observed in the southern part
of the Okhotsk Sea during the whole
year. From month to month they changed both their sizes and
relative location.
The Kuril Islands area within the Sea of Okhotsk can be conventionally separated
into the northern and southern parts.
In January the whole southern part of the Sea was occupied by
the anticyclonic gyre with two centers extending along the Kuril Islands
up to 48°N. To the north of
this structure, a cyclonic vortex of considerably smaller size
was located. Together with the
anticyclonic gyre it formed a dipole with
a meridionally oriented axis. In February the cyclonic gyre
was shifted southward to the Islands, while driving back the main anticyclone to the south-west. Their
sizes became equal, and the dipole axis extended along the Kuril Islands. At
the same time, a cyclonic
gyre originated near the southern terminal of Sakhalin Island.
In March it displaced the anticyclone
from the southern part of the Sea and thus shifted the dipole
to the northeast. Such a situation was still
preserved in April-May.
In June the anticyclonic gyre moved to the south.
It was composed by two centers, one of
them was situated to the northwest of the Bussol' Strait, and another to the northwest of the Ekaterina
Strait. A cyclonic gyre occurred near the
coast of Sakhalin Island and stretched out in the northeastern
direction while merging with the cyclone situated
to the north of the anticyclonic gyre in the previous
months. The similar situation was manifested in July-August when both the anticyclone and cyclone
were extended along the Islands to the north-east.
Starting from August the cyclonic gyre increased in
size from the north to the south and in September it occupied the whole southern
part of the Okhotsk
Sea up to 49°N and 148°E. Horizontal sizes of the anticyclone
grew essentially smaller, and the dipole
axis was again oriented to the northwest.
In October the double center cyclonic gyre increased in size, mainly eastward, up to 150°E,
and the anticyclone moved to the northeast along the Islands while decreasing in size and stretching out
along; the meridian. An approximately similar picture
was preserved in November-December, but the
anticyclone gradually extended along the Islands
up to the Strait of Ekaterina.
The cyclonic gyre located near the Kruzenshtern and Forth Kuril Straits
was observed during
the whole year and its horizontal size was not changed notably. However, during
some months, while
growing stronger, it merged with the cyclone which moved from the south.
The structure of the main Okhotsk Sea currents,
as well as the system of gyres with different
vorticity in its southern part, changed considerably from
season to season. To the great extent the
temporal variability is related to the reconstruction of the atmospheric
processes. This allows
amplification of existing notions on water dynamics and their seasonal variability, especially in
the
southern part of the sea.
Based on our calculations it is possible to estimate the integral discharge through the Straits. In
practiically all the Straits the flows of different orientation
were revealed: in the northern straits the
Pacific waters inflow being predominant, whereas in the southern straits
the outflow of the Okhotsk
Sea waters was observed. The total water discharge through the Kuril Straits
varied from 0 to -1.0 Sv
and was approximately equal to the water discharge through the La Perouse Strait.
Table 1 presents
the integral discharge of waters through the Kuril Straits for August and December (sign "+" denotes
the Pacific waters penetration into the Okhotsk Sea).
Comparison of our numerical calculations with results presented elsewhere (Bobkov, 1992;
Luchiin, 1982, 1987; Moroshkin, 1966; Sekine, 1990; Zyryanov, 1974,
1977) shows a satisfactory
correspondence with the main elements of the Okhotsk Sea circulation schemes.
But it should be noted
161
that the cyclonic character of waters circulation stated by many authors, was
confirmed for the
northern part of the Sea only.
In the southern part the complicated dipole structures changing their
sizes and location were observed.

Acoustic Methods
in Sea Ice Dynamics Studies

The interaction of engineering structures with ice in the regions with fast or drifting ice cover
is significant.
The most difficult problem is to describe floe interaction, because an ice cover drift
depends on external forces acting at some points
as well as on the state of ice cover in adjacent areas.
The ice dynamics is determined by hydrometeorological
processes. The equation of strength
balance on a specific ice surface is based
on hydrodynamic theory of ice cover drift:
= r+ zW+C+G+R
67
where V is drift velocity factor; p is ice density; Ta is tangent air pressure on the ice surface
caused by wind; TN,
is strength of friction between ice and water; C is the Coriolis force; G is
projection of gravity on the sea surface; R is internal resistance caused by interaction between ice
flows.
Unfortunately, there are no suitable methods for evaluation of the last parameter R. To
overcome this difficulty the following equations were used (Volkov et al., 1971) to describe a spatial
irregularity of the ice drift:
div V = dv/dy + du/dx
rot V = dv/dx - du/dy
def, V = dv/dx + du/dy
deft V = dv/dy - du/dx
where u and v are projections of vector V
on axes x and y correspondingly.
The first equation (divergence)
characterizes the intensity of ice cover extension (compacting)
at a given point,
whereas the second equation (rotation) illustrates the velocity of the turn. It should be
noted that both equations are invariant in coordinate
axes. The two last equations represent the rate
change of ice cover element formation
or deformation. So, the third equation gives angular
deformation (i.e. the change of angle between the sides of the originally square area) and the fourth
shows irregularity of linear deformation along two perpendicular
axes. Thus, to solve the problem of
the study of sea ice dynamics it is necessary to
carry out frequent and accurate measurements of spatial
deformation characteristics of the ice cover.
ACTIVE ACOUSTIC METHOD
Two approaches are used to study the ice dynamics.
The first is based on the continuous
measurements of buoy coordinates installed on different floes. These measurements
are performed by
a space system designed for observations and radio communication. The second method is based
on
observations of ice formation characteristics with active and passive
sensors from the artificial Earth
satellites.
Both methods are mainly used to determine the large scale movements of ice cover. To
167
study the middle scale ice deformations the radiohydroacoustic method was developed in the Arctic
and Antarctic Research Institute (Bogorodsky et al., 1975). It is based on measuring (with
necessary accuracy) the difference among time intervals corresponding to the propagation of a sound
impulse in a water body between several marked drifting flows situated within the distance of one
wavelength of acoustic ray propagation.
The change in distance from point A to B for the period between successive observations can
be calculated using the sound impulses propagation time:
Ar=r - r; = c,,(t-t;)
where t and t; are the times of sound propagation between A and B, c,,, is the sound velocity in sea
water. The main limitation of this method is the temporal fluctuations of the vertical sound velocity
distribution which can lead to distortions of the refraction sound picture if ray approximation is used.
The relative accuracy of distance evaluation is:
Ar / r = At/t+Ac./c,,
The At/t is the accuracy of sound propagation time registration and Ac,,,/c, is the accuracy of known
sound velocity. The first parameter is systematic and can be not taken into account. Thus, the
accuracy of the Or/r measurement is caused only by Ac,,,/c,,,. and is about 0.02% of the measured
distance, if Weelson's empirical formula is used to calculate the sound velocity from experimental data
(Stashkevich, 1966).
In addition to the seasonal variations of sound velocity, the short period internal waves have an
influence on the acoustic signal propagation time. Internal waves are sometimes formed in the zone of
the upper thermocline and can induce the distortion of the refraction sound picture. To consider this
effect continuous temperature and salinity measurements were carried out in the layer where the main
changes of water physical parameters occur.
One of the numerous in-situ measurements is presented in Fig. 1, as an example. Here, each
point on the experimental curve represents an average r-value determined within the 30-min interval of
observation while each marking off was taken every 30 sec. In addition, the results of estimated ice
cover linear deformation was obtained with the help of repeated large scale air-photo surveys.
Analysis of the independent observations shows their sufficient coincidence as evidence of the high
efficiency of the radiohydroacoustic method for the middle scale ice deformation studies.
This
conclusion justifies the elaboration of a multi-channel radiohydroacoustic automatic station designed
for the collection and transmission of information on the strain stress state of the ice cover. Installation
of such devices directly on engineering structures will permit exploitation with reduce risk in the
regions with fast or pack ice.
PASSIVE ACOUSTIC METHOD
The method is based on the relationship between the energetic and frequency characteristics of
ambient noise made during the ice destruction caused by stress state change (which can be explained by
the variability of the hydrometeorological processes). Parameters of elastic oscillation (amplitude,
frequency spectrum, wave length, sound and vibration velocities, duration of acoustic impulses, sound
energy density) can be independent criteria for determination of the ice state before, during and after
the moment of ice break up. In particular, the wide spectral maximum at the 50-300 Hz frequency
range and 10-12 dB/octave fall of noise level in the direction of high frequency are distinctive
characteristics of the noise connected with ice destruction.
168
The following multi-correlation equation is the result of analysis of the correlation
relationships for statistical dependencies linking sound pressure in the water (P), wind velocity (Vw,),
drift ice velocity (V;), air temperature (ta), deformation, divergence and other parameters and their
derivatives:
P=a*div V+b*def C+c*V,,+d*ta+Po
The coefficients a, b, c and d are functions of the partial coefficients of correlation, dispersion and
mean values of the equation parameters, V is the vector of drift velocity. In different seasons some
terms of the equation can be neglected (i.e. in winter P = b*def C+d*ta+P0). In such cases the
reverse task can be solved and def V or div V can be found. These values will characterize the
stress state of ice cover in the areas within the radius of spatial correlation.
The practical solution of the task for the Arctic ocean has demonstrated that the proposed
method is quite suitable for the estimation of the ice extension or compression intensity. Fig.2 shows
fragments of these investigations. The curves 1 (measured) and 2 (calculated) represent temporal
changes of noise levels in 20-100 Hz frequency band. The calculated curves 3 and 4 (smoothed)
display the deformation of ice cover.
Observations of ice break-up processes, including ice drift at Yenisey, Angara and Daugava
rivers also illustrate applicability of acoustic methods for remote studies of ice cover state (Bogorodsky
and Gavrilo, 1976). Investigations of ice formation physics during ice destruction performed both in
laboratory and in-situ have allowed one to obtain the spectrum and energetic characteristics of noise
generated at the different stages of ice stress state and during the process of ice drift. Spectral energy
characteristics (pressure of underwater ambient noise in the 1 Hz frequency band relative to the zero
level 2 105 Pa) from the delta region of the Yenisey river are presented in Fig. 3. It clearly shows that
extreme dynamic process during the ice drift causes an essential (up to 40 dB) increase of noise level
by comparison with the corresponding characteristics for the unmoving ice cover (complete freezing)
or for the ice-free river surface (complete ice clearance). Besides, the non-stationary acoustic noise for
the river ice break-up differs from the quasi-stationary noise while unmoving ice cover exists on the
river.
The represented spectra also demonstrate that the wide maximum, caused by the rupturing and
crushing of ice, takes place in the frequency band from 0.4 up to 3.0 kHz. The maximum can be
widened up to 4.0-5.0 kHz due to friction between snowy ice flows.
The acoustic noise features mentioned above could be the basis for elaboration of methods to
control the ice dynamic state at the local river regions in order to improve the ice jam forecast.

The Role of the Far-East Atmospheric Circulation in the Formation of the
Ice Cover in the Okhotsk Sea
Nina M. PESTEREVA and Larissa A. STARODUBTSEVA
Department of Meteorology, Far Eastern State University, Vladivostok, Russia
INTRODUCTION
One of the major characteristics of the intensity of ice formation is the ratio of the ice covered
sea area to the whole sea area.
In this study we consider a long-term variability of this ratio for the
Okhotsk Sea.
The ice cover has a pronounced annual variability explained by natural and, especially during
last years, by anthropogenic peculiarities.
Natural features include hydrologic factors and the
atmospheric circulation in the second natural synoptic region enveloping the area from 80°E up to
160°W.
METHOD AND DATA
Data on the Okhotsk Sea ice cover for the period from 1957 to 1990 have been provided
by
chiefs of the Sea Forecasting Laboratories of the Primorsky Department on Hydrometeorology and
Environment Monitoring. Based on this information the time period was divided on three
classes:
(1) years with heavy ice cover;
(2) years with light ice cover;
(3) all other years or years when ice cover of the Okhotsk Sea was normal or near normal.
The years:
1958-59, 1966-67, 1968-69, 1972-73, 1977-78, 1978-79, 1986-87 were regarded as the
first class or heavy ice-covered years (Table 1).
The second class or light ice-covered years were
determined as follows:
1963-64, 1973-74, 1975-76, 1983-84, 1984-85, 1987-88 (Table 2).
Features
of atmospheric circulation for the second natural synoptic region were analyzed for different year
classes.
Snow, as well as ice, are very sensitive elements of the Sun - Earth - atmosphere system and
considerably influence both micro- and mesoclimate, weather and atmospheric circulation.
Conversely, the atmospheric circulation effects on ice-formation for various classes.
The troposphere circulation anomalies cannot be explained only by the interrelation processes
between the troposphere and underlying surface. The stratospheric circulation and its interaction
with
troposphere also play a key role in the formation of a certain weather regime. The circumpolar gyre
is
a major synoptic stratospheric phenomenon defining the weather of the
northern hemisphere for
moderate latitudes. Fluctuations of the intensity and location, to a considerable extent, influence the
weather regime in different regions. A detailed description of this approach was given in publications
by the distinguished Russian meteorologist Pedya (1976).
The circumpolar gyre trajectories are rather complicated. The cyclonic gyre propagates after
the stratospheric cold site, which appears as a result of air cooling during the polar night. Thus, at
the
first stage we considered the circumpolar gyre intensity and features during the cold period from
172
November till March for heavy and light ice years using positions of the gyre center and monthly mean
data for the geopotential at 100 mbar. In cases where the gyre had two or more centers, we took into
account the center located in the Asian sector of the Arctic, or that situated above the Asian continent,
and calculated mean values for the first and second year classes.
To reveal the tropospheric circulation features, the data on the Ilyinsky circulation forms were
used.
RESULTS
For heavy ice cover years in the Okhotsk Sea, in 60% of cases the circumpolar gyre center
shifted to the Asian continent southward of 70°N (e.g. Fig. 1) and the Far Eastern trough stretched to
the Khabarovsky Region. The center of the circumpolar gyre was located to the southeast of the usual
long-term position in 72% of cases for the period from November till March. Monthly mean
distribution of the geopotential at 100 mbar for November 1977 and March 1978 is given on Fig. 1.
This map shows that meridional and particularly, western circulation prevailed during this season (it
was above normal in 3-11% cases for different years). The planetary high altitude frontal zone was
located further to the south in comparison with the long-term mean, which is normally near 40°N. The
cyclones moved the southern trajectories. The arctic air mass advection was observed on the western
edge of the high-altitude Far-Eastern trough in these circumstances, and negative air temperature
anomalies were formed above the southern Far-East, Japanese Islands and Okhotsk Sea. These thermal
and dynamic factors contributed to an intensive process of ice formation and maintenance of a severe
ice regime in the Okhotsk Sea.
For light ice years in the Okhotsk Sea, the circumpolar gyre shifted to the northwest in
comparison with its normal position (Fig. 2). The high altitude Far Eastern trough was weak and an
intensive zonal movement was noticed above the region. Meridional processes were below normal up
to 5-10% and latitudinal circulation occurred more often in comparison with the normal years. The
high-altitude frontal zone stretched to the north from Lake Baikal, to the Amur river and further to the
south of the Okhotsk Sea. Simultaneously, with the cyclones movement along the high altitude frontal
zone, the drift over of warm air masses towards the Okhotsk Sea was seen. Over the larger part of the
Far East, the positive air temperature anomalies at the surface are present followed by less than normal
ice cover in the Okhotsk Sea.
Thus, the atmospheric processes in the troposphere and lower stratosphere during fall and the
first half of winter are important factors influencing the ice formation in the Okhotsk Sea.

Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion and its Teleconnection with
Subarctic North Pacific Circulation, Sea Ice of the Okhotsk Sea and
Air Temperature of the Northern Asian Continent
Yoshihiko SEKINE
Faculty of Bioresources, Mie University, Tsu, Mie-ken, Japan
INTRODUCTION
The subarctic water (known as the First Branch of the Oyashio) extends southward in the
surface layer along the coast of Honshu, Japan. Sometimes the Oyashio Water reaches off the Boso
peninsula, and then it is often called the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion. The water near the southern
tip of the extended area is considerably modified by horizontal mixing with surrounding waters, but
keeps the cold and less saline characteristics of subarctic waters. The Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion
usually causes the abnormally cold summer in the northern areas of Honshu, Japan, and influences the
coastal fisheries.
The southernmost latitude of the 5°C isotherm at a depth of 100 in is frequently used as an
index of this southward Oyashio extension strength. The variation of this latitude is shown in Fig. 1
(the bottom curve).
For the period from 1970 to 1988 the eminent Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion
occurred in 1973-74, 1981, 1984 and 1986. Charts of the sea surface temperature anomalies in April
1981 and April 1984 taken from the Ten-day Marine Report published by Japan Meteorological
Agency are presented on Fig. 2. It can be seen that the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion is not a local
phenomenon, and the low temperature anomalies are widely observed within the subarctic and
subtropical waters of the western North Pacific.
In the present work the occurrence of the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion and its relationship
with several oceanographic and meteorological phenomena will be discussed.
THE OCCURRENCE OF THE ANOMALOUS OYASHIO INTRUSION AND WIND CONDITIONS OVER THE
NORTH PACIFIC
Based on the wind stress data by Kutsuwada and Teramoto (1987), Sekine (1988a) suggested
that the latitude of no wind stress curl is observed in mid-winter just before the occurrence of the
Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion. Using a numerical modelling (homogenous ocean model), he also
demonstrated (Sekine, 1998b) that change in the wind stress field over the North Pacific Ocean causes
the subsequent change in the subarctic circulation pattern: the southward shift of the no wind stress
curl is usually accompanied by an increase of the wind stress over the North Pacific. The volume
transport of the subarctic circulation is enhanced, and its position at the southern margin is shifted
southward. This influences the occurrence of the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion. In the present paper,
only the averaged winter wind stress data just before the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion (namely the
average over late autumns and winters of 1973-4, 1980-81 and 1983-84), and that for the other years
are considered.
Here, we numerically examine the year-to-year variations of the subarctic circulation in the
North Pacific by using a two-layer ocean model
on a beta plane. For simplicity, we consider an ocean
177
with simplified geometry and bottom topography as shown in Fig. 3a and 3b. The hydrostatic, rigid
lid and Boussinesqu approximations are adopted. The governing equations are the same as used by
Sekine and Kutsuwada (1994). The grid interval is 1 degree both in the west-east and the south-north
directions. The coefficient of horizontal eddy viscosity is set to be 5x106 cm2 s' in this analysis.
Teramoto and Kutsuwada (1987) compiled monthly mean wind stress fields over the North
Pacific Ocean for the period from April 1961 to March 1984. The monthly mean wind stress fields
from April 1984 to December 1987 were obtained using the same approach and the wind velocity data
supplied by the Japan Meteorological Agency. These monthly mean fields are assumed to represent
the field at the middle of the corresponding month, and the daily fields are calculated by interpolating
these monthly values. The obtained wind stress data from January 1961 to December 1987 are applied
in our model. However, as the ocean is presumed initially at rest and as the time scale of the
baroclinic response is several years in our model, baroclinic adjustment may not be completed before
1970. In the later analysis, the comparison with the change of the Oyashio Intrusion strength would be
made mainly for the period after 1971.
The distribution of the total volume transport function is displayed in Fig. 4 for January of
each year. The western boundary currents are formed even during the first year (January 1961),
indicating that such gross features are created through barotropic responses.
The portions of anti-
clockwise circulation (the subarctic circulation) are shaded in each figure.
The area of the subarctic
circulation and its strength (the density of the transport function in the shaded area) are characterized
by noticeable temporal variability. It can be seen that the area and the strength have a tendency to
increase in the years of the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion: namely, in 1974, 1981, 1984, and 1986.
The southernmost latitudes of the calculated subarctic circulation were obtained for three
longitudinal ranges:
1. 142°E - 170°W (the wider domain),
2. 142°E - 170°E (the domain west of the Emperor Sea Mounts) and
3. 142°E - 150°E (the Oyashio region).
Temporal variations of these latitudes for the period from 1971 to 1987 are shown in the
upper-top, the upper-middle, and the upper-lower curves of Fig. 1, respectively. The seasonal
variation is distinctive for all of three curves, except the period 1972-75 for the wider domain. The
southern boundary of the subarctic circulation shifts southward generally in winter and northward in
summer-autumn for almost all longitudes under consideration. However, the southernmost latitudes or
the strengths of the southward winter shift are very changeable from year to year:
the strengths are
high in 1974, 1977-1978, 1980-1984, and 1986.
The temporal variation of the Oyashio Intrusion strength (the southern most latitude of the 5°C
isotherm at 100 m depth) is also shown in the lower curve of Fig. 1 for the period from 1971 to 1987.
The seasonal variability of this curve is not so significant, and variations having longer periods appear
to be dominant. As discussed before, the southern shift of the latitude is distinguished in 1974, 1981,
1984 and 1986, and we assume that the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion occurred for these years. From
the same curve, we may conclude that the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion took place also in 1977, 1978,
1982 and 1983, though its magnitude was somewhat smaller. It should be noted that these years just
coincide with the years of the strong southward shift of the southern boundary of the subarctic
circulation.
The correlation coefficient between the Oyashio Intrusion strength (the lower curve
in Fig. 1)
and the latitude of the southern boundary of the subarctic circulation is 0.35 if we chose the Oyashio
Region (142°E-150°E: the upper-lower curve in Fig. 1) or 0.38 if we chose the domain west of the
178
Emperor Sea Mounts (142°-170°:
the upper-middle curve in Fig. 1). The latter coefficient is
increased to 0.40 if we apply one month lag for the curve of the Oyashio Intrusion strength.
The correlation coefficient between the Oyashio Intrusion strength and the latitude of the no
wind stress curl is also calculated for the same period, and the coefficient is 0.31 without lag and 0.40
with one month lag. Though the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion is a rather local phenomenon along the
Pacific coast of the northern part of Honshu, it is strongly suggested that Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion
has a close relation to the strength and the position of the global subarctic circulation in the North
Pacific and to the position of the no wind stress curl of the wind system over the North Pacific.
OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA RELATED TO THE ANOMALOUS OYASHIO INTRUSION
Examples of the distribution of the 500 hPa height anomaly over the northern hemisphere are
presented in Fig. 5 at the time of the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion. In these figures, a prominently
low pressure area is seen over the North Pacific and high pressure areas over the north Asian
Continent (the Siberian High) and over North America. These distributions correspond to the so called
PNA pattern, which relates to the ENSO phenomenon or abnormal high sea surface temperatures in the
equatorial Pacific (Horel and Wallace, 1981; Shukla and Wallace, 1983). It strongly suggests that the
occurrence of the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion would have a teleconnection with the ENSO
phenomenon.
The air temperature anomalies averaged over the nine stations shown in Fig. 6 for the
years of the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion (1974, 1981, 1984, and 1986) were calculated. The
anomalies in
December and January are positive, and equal to 1.57°C and 1.73°C, respectively. The
winter air temperature at the stations surrounding the Okhotsk Sea and in the northern Asian Continent
appears to be relatively warmer at the time of the occurrence of the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion.
The similar correlation between the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion and the sea ice cover of the Okhotsk
Sea can be seen:
the area of sea ice cover of the Okhotsk Sea were calculated for each month from
December to May separately for the years of the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion and for the years of no
Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion (all years from 1970 to 1988 except for 1974, 1981, 1984 and 1986).
The obtained results are shown in Table 1. The sea ice cover is clearly larger for the years of no
Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion: averaged ice cover area for the whole period analyzed is 61.5 x 104
km2 for the years of the Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion and 77.1 x 104 km2 for the other years.
Bhanu Kumar (1988) estimated the area of monthly snow cover of the Eurasian Continent for
the period from 1970 to 1986. A significant positive correlation between this snow cover and the
Okhotsk sea ice cover areas can be seen for both January data and three months data averaged from
December to February (Figs. 7a and 7b). As Yasunari (1990) pointed out the close relationship
between the strength of the Asian Monsoon and the occurrence of ENSO phenomena, there is much
evidence suggesting the relationship among various oceanic and atmospheric phenomena. Though the
Anomalous Oyashio Intrusion is a rather local phenomenon off the Pacific coast of the northern part of
Honshu, Japan, but it should be noted that its occurrence is closely related with various large scale
phenomena such as the subarctic North Pacific circulation, the wind stress distribution over the North
Pacific, the atmospheric pressure pattern like the PNA pattern, the sea ice coverage of the Okhotsk
Sea, the snow coverage over the Eurasian Continent, the ENSO phenomenon, and etc. Further
investigations are necessary to explain the physical mechanisms of these teleconnections.

Characteristics of the Tidal Motions in the Kuril Straits
Vladimir A. LUCHIN
Far Eastern Regional Hydrometeorological Research Institute, Vladivostok, Russia
INTRODUCTION
The tidal currents increase considerably their velocity in the Kuril Straits and create favorable
conditions for intensive vertical and lateral water mixing leading to a decrease of the vertical gradients
of the water properties observed in the region.
Results from previous investigations and data collected from 66 buoy stations within the Kuril
Island area were recently examined by Luchin (1995).
Tidal constants from 20 island positions were
used to calculate yearly sea level fluctuations.
All data obtained demonstrate that the main part of the
Kuril region is characterized by predominant diurnal tidal currents and sea level fluctuations.
These
tides and sea levels are in phase: during the low water time it is clearly seen that observed differences
in the onset time of tidal extrema do not exceed 1-2 hours and depend mostly on the geographical
position and local bottom topography of sea level observational points.
The diurnal tidal sea level
fluctuations are dominant during both summer and winter and the maximum tidal amplitudes are
detected in these seasons.
Semidiurnal sea level fluctuations are the most pronounced in March and
September.
The major ellipse axes of tidal currents are directed mainly along isobaths, whereas in the
straits they are oriented along the troughs. In narrow straits, under specific astronomic conditions,
maximum tidal currents can reach 5-8 knots.
DATA AND METHOD
The instrumental current measurements were collected from 516 stations in the Kuril region.
Unfortunately, their duration at 450 stations did not exceed 1 day and was from 3 to 15 days only at 66
buoy stations (38 of which have been located in the narrows of straits).
Sea level fluctuations along
the Kuril Islands have been considered at 20 coastal stations. The hourly sea level heights were
calculated using tidal constants for 8 main constituents.
RESULTS
Analysis of available observations show that vertical structure of tidal currents in the Kuril
Straits is quite homogeneous (Fig. 1).
Variations of current parameters with depth are insignificant
and demonstrate that the barotropic component dominates in tidal flow.
Certain variations in the
current directions at specific depths are probably related to the topographic peculiarities within the
straits. The weakest tidal current velocities are observed in the Bussol Strait.
Therefore, water
structure here is less transformed and the effect of non-periodic and baroclinic disturbances
increases in
the tidal flow.
188
Simultaneous current measurements were also performed at several points spatially divided up
to 26 miles. These data show that spatial variations of tidal flow (in the absence of abrupt topographic
changes) are insignificant.
The sea level temporal variations and tidal current features demonstrate the existence of a
certain interaction between them. Temporal sea level fluctuations simultaneous with current
observations were calculated using tidal constants from the nearest sea level station and the following
results were obtained. In the Bussol Strait (sill depth 2,318 m) tides have a progressive wave
character. The maximum tidal currents penetrating into the Pacific occur in the period of low water or
about 1 hour before.
Standing fluctuations are observed in the deep part of the Kruzenshtern Strait (sill depth 1,920
m). The maximum currents occur 1-3 hours before low water (Fig. 2). The standing fluctuations
dominate also in the shallow straits and over the shallow parts of the deep straits. For instance, the
tidal currents move into the Okhotsk Sea over the shallow part of the Kruzenshtern Strait as sea level
rises and reverse into the Pacific Ocean as sea level falls (Fig. 3).
The anomaly relation between sea level and the currents is observed in the deep trough of the
4th Kuril Strait. Standing fluctuations are dominant in this case, but the maximum currents into the
Okhotsk Sea occur 6-8 hours after the low water (Fig. 4). Further investigations under different
astronomic conditions are required for this region.
Thus, in the straits with complicated morphometry different contributions of progressive and
standing wave components were observed. It can lead to generation of eddy disturbances within the
tidal flow. This event should also be expected in the regions of abrupt depth changes.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FIELD OBSERVATIONS
1.
Current measurements in the main Kuril Straits should be conducted simultaneously and duration
of observations has to be not less than 15 days. Sea level fluctuations should be recorded nearby at
the same time.
2. Tidal observations in straits with complicated topography should be simultaneously assessed in
both troughs and shallow water regions.
3. Observations have to be carried out in the periods of prevailing diurnal currents as well as when
semidiurnal currents are dominant.

On Seasonal Variability of Tidal Constants, in the
Northwestern Part of the Okhotsk Sea
George V. SHEVCHENKO
Institute of Marine Geology and Geophysics, Far Eastern Branch,
Russian Academy of Sciences, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Russia
INTRODUCTION
The main problem of tidal regime research could normally be reduced to the determination of
tidal constants (amplitude h and phase g) from the available sea level observational series.
Tidal sea
levels and currents for any moment of time can be predicted using these constants.
In most cases a
monthly observational series is enough for reliable estimation of h and g, and as a rule, a
corresponding long-term forecast can be made with sufficiently high accuracy, satisfying practical
requirements for hydrology surveys, port activities, coastal engineering, etc.
However, in some ocean regions this method does not work properly for various reasons, such
as, change in water circulation, bottom friction, influence of ice, outflow of energy into internal
waves, etc. As a result, temporal variability of tidal constants is observed (Pugh and Vassie, 1976;
Sgibneva, 1981) and prediction of tides turns into a more difficult problem.
A correct prediction of tidal currents and sea levels is highly important for the northwestern
part of the Okhotsk Sea because of planned development of the oil and natural gas industry in this area.
In the present work the seasonal variability of tidal constants is studied based on hourly sea level data
at three stations: Nabil Bay (Katangli), Okhotsk and Moskalvo. Seven year average tidal constants
were used to calculate the amplitude and phase "systematic corrections" for each month.
DATA ANALYSIS
Hourly sea level data from tide gauges in the Okhotsk Sea [Korsakov (1977-1990), Poronaisk
(1977-1988), Kurilsk (1977-1985), Magadan (1977-1988), Okhotsk (1982-1988), Moskalvo (1965-
1966, January-May) and Katangli (1987-1993)] were analyzed. Tidal sea level constituents were
determined by least square method for all years. Significant difference between observed and predicted
sea level series has been found at three stations in the northwestern part of the Okhotsk Sea (Okhotsk,
Moskalvo, Katangli) where spectra of residual sea levels had prominent peaks at tidal frequency
bands). For these stations, tidal constituents were determined for each month separately as in Pugh
and Vassie (1976). Since for monthly series some tidal constituents (such as K, and P, or S2 and K2)
could not be separated, they were estimated using values obtained from the whole year. Our results
(Figs. 1 and 2) clearly demonstrate that the amplitude and phase of main constituents change from
month to month.
Similar phenomenon was also revealed in some other Okhotsk Sea regions, in particular for
Penzhinskaya Guba (Sgibneva, 1981) and in Amursky Liman (Lyubitsky, 1989).
194
SEASONAL VARIABILITY OF TIDAL CONSTANTS
Seasonal variability of tidal constants at Okhotsk and Moskalvo stations is very strong. For
the principal semidiurnal constituent M2 variances in amplitude and phase are over 30% and 25°,
respectively. Maximum amplitudes are observed in March and April and maximum phases are found
in September and October when amplitudes are small. The diurnal tides have maximum amplitudes
and minimum phases in January, whereas minimum amplitudes are observed in August and maximum
phases in October. Thus, seasonal variability of tidal amplitudes and phases of the main constituents is
almost in counter-phase.
Variability of tidal constants on the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island is not evident.
Although the maximum amplitudes (in April and December) mainly correspond to minimum phases,
but maximum phases (in September for diurnal tides and in July for M2) do not coincide with minimum
amplitudes observed in June for diurnal tides or in January - February for M2. It should be noted that
variability of tidal constants at Katangli station is not so significant and clearly emphatic as at the
Okhotsk station where it has almost periodic character.
"SYSTEMATIC CORRECTIONS" OF TIDAL CONSTANTS
Seven year average tidal constants for Okhotsk and Katangli stations were used to calculate
"systematic monthly corrections". The amplitude corrections have been estimated as a ratio of the
average monthly values to the whole year value, while the phase correction was computed as a
difference between monthly and the whole year values. These corrections may be used in analysis of
relatively short off-shore measurements of currents and sea levels, and also for more accurate tidal
predictions.
To characterize the importance of "systematic corrections" three variances and corresponding
ratios (%) have been calculated for each tidal constituent (Table 1):
1. Factoral (or intergroup) variance (Df) related to deviations of the mean monthly values from
the mean yearly value;
2. Average group variance (Dg) associated with deviations of mean monthly values for every year
from the average (over 7 years) monthly values caused by various reasons, considered as
casual;
3. Total variance (D,) equals to the sum of two previous.
The relative contribution of the intergroup variances demonstrates the importance of regular
events in comparison with the casual elements caused by fluctuations inside the groups. It is also
evident, that in the Okhotsk region seasonal fluctuations of tidal constants are the most essential, and
casual deviations are insignificant compared to "systematic monthly corrections".
CONCLUSIONS
1. Significant seasonal variability of tidal constants in the northwestern part of the Okhotsk Sea has
been revealed based on analysis of tide gauge data.
2. Seasonal variability is high and steady in the Okhotsk region and rather less on the northeastern
coast of Sakhalin Island.
3. Use of "systematic monthly amplitude and phase corrections", calculated from seven year average
tidal constants, reduces errors of sea level prediction up to 0.5 in in the Okhotsk region and up to
0.2 in at Katangli station.
195
4. Obtained results could be used for more accurate forecast of tidal sea levels and currents in the
northwestern part of the Okhotsk Sea.

INTRODUCTION
It is generally believed that the Japan Sea Proper Water (JSPW) is formed in the northwestern
part of the Japan Sea. Nevertheless, this area was investigated very poorly in comparison with the
southern part of the Sea. Almost twenty five years ago Nitani (1972) noted that the winter situation in
the northwestern Japan Sea is unknown and suggested a survey in Peter the Great Bay just before and
during the period of ice formation. None the less, after fifteen years, Gamo et al. (1986) mentioned a
lack of information about the spatial and temporal variations of water properties in the northern Japan
Sea regarded as a regional source of the bottom water and emphasized the need to research the
northern and northwestern Japan Basin, especially in the winter season. According to Sudo (1986), the
most probable source of the JSPW formation is the region north of 41°N between 132°E and 134°E.
This statement was amplified by Senju and Sudo (1993) who advised that the upper portion of the
JSPW is formed by winter convection, likely off the Siberian coast west of 136°E between 40°N and
43°N.
Now the opportunity arose to discuss the process of water formation in the northwestern part
of the Japan Sea based on new temperature and salinity data collected during two consecutive winters
in 1994 and 1995.
DATA
During the winter of 1994 research vessels of Far Eastern Regional Hydrometeorological
Research Institute repeated temperature and salinity measurements nine times on the section along
132°E from Vladivostok to 36.5°N. In March 1995 seven one-time sections were performed from the
coast to 41.0°N between 131.5°E and 133.6°E. The total number of stations sampled was 116.
Note the interesting feature of bottom relief in the area of investigation: just south of
Vladivostok between 41.5°N and 42.5°N there is a bottom rise with a minimum depth less than 1,000
m contoured by a 2,500 m isobath.
VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF WATER CHARACTERISTICS IN 1994 AND 1995
The "chimney" - area of homogenous vertical water properties near the bottom rise - was
revealed for the first time in March 1994 along 132°E between 41.5°N and 42.5°N. In March 1995
during the winter CREAMS cruise the meridional boundaries were determined as 131.8°E and
133.2°E. The "chimney" was bordered from the south and west by the Subarctic (Polar) thermal
front, from the north by a coastal saline front and from the east by a coastal thermal front.
198
In March 1994 the temperature in the "chimney" changed from -0.7°C to 0.7°C and was lower
than in neighboring waters. Salinity in this area varied between 34.02 and 34.19 psu and was lower
than in the northern part of Peter the Great Bay, but higher than in surrounding waters by 0.03-0.10
psu. Density (sigma-t) in the "chimney" was in the range 27.30-27.44, almost uniform in vertical
direction and also differed from density of adjacent waters. Seawater homogeneity was observed from
the surface down to 1,500 m (the lowest horizon of observations).
In March 1995 measurements at section along 132.3°E were performed with better accuracy
and just above the bottom rise, and the characteristics of seawater were found in a good agreement
with our previous survey (Table 1). Depth of salinity maximum was situated at 300-500 m and depth
of temperature minimum at 1,700-1,900 m.
At 132°E (western border of the "chimney" area) and at 133°E (its eastern edge) the sigma-
theta surface of 27.32 was located at depth above 100 m. In the center of the "chimney" near surface
sigma-t was higher than 27.32 (Fig. 1). Between the surface and 1,000 m water temperature changed
from 0.5°C to 1.0°C and salinity from 34.05 to 34.07 psu. Even during summer, sigma-t of 27.3 was
closer to the sea surface than anywhere else in the Japan Sea.
HORIZONTAL WATER STRUCTURE
At the sea surface in winter the "chimney" area was bordered from the south and west by the
Subarctic (Polar) front and from the north by the coastal Primorye front. The Subarctic front was best
revealed by temperature distribution and the coastal front by salinity distribution. According to
satellite images (e.g., November 28, 1983) water of in the "chimney" was colder than surrounding
waters, and that cold pool is detected in the area every winter. It should also be mentioned that
extremely high salinity (more than 34.15 psu) was observed in the pool at the end of 1994.
CONCLUSION
The "chimney", an area of homogeneous vertical temperature and salinity distribution, was
found in winter above the bottom rise near Vladivostok. The "chimney" water is characterized by
temperature 0.5°C - 1.0°C, salinity - 34.05-34.07, and density (sigma-t) higher than 27.3.

INTRODUCTION
The circulation of the Japan Sea is dominated by the throughflow of the Tsushima Current,
which enters through the Korean Straits, branches along the Korean and Japanese coasts, and exits
through the Tsugaru and Soya Straits. It is also strongly influenced by atmospheric forcing and river
runoff, plus ice formation and tidal circulation, especially in the northern reaches of the Tatarsky
Strait. The instantaneous circulation is characterized by intense mesoscale variability;
i.e.,
meandering jets, eddies, and fronts. The upper few hundred meters of the southern half of the basin
are much more stratified than the northern half of the basin; the two halves are separated by the
subpolar front and jet. The lower few kilometers of the water column are filled with the relatively
homogeneous Japan Sea Proper Water, which, however, has fine structure associated with interannual
variations in wintertime deep convection.
Major open questions exist concerning the deep convection process, which has at least three
candidate source regions: north of the subpolar front off Vladivostok, various shallow sites along the
Primorsky Coast (especially Peter the Great Bay), and the Tatarsky Strait in association with ice
formation. So far, the physical estimates of deep water formation rates are substantially less than those
inferred from geochemical properties. Other open questions include the role of mesoscale variability
in the evolution of the general circulation (including deep water formation), the seasonal evolution of
the circulation and stratification, the response to Siberian cold air outbreaks and subtropical cyclones,
and to seasonal and interannual variability of the inflows. In general, there is presently a strong
interest in understanding the circulation of semi-enclosed seas, with the Japan Sea representing a
different part of parameter space compared to the Gulf of Mexico/Caribbean Sea and the Okhotsk Sea,
for example. Several numerical simulations for the Japan Sea circulation have been undertaken in
recent years; for example, Seung and Kim (1993), Kim and Yoon (1994), and Holloway, et al.
(1995), with considerable success. However, they have all lacked various elements of realism, and it
is desirable to attempt further progress.
Thus, a numerical simulation has been undertaken with an advanced, primitive equation model
[Princeton Ocean Model: POM; Blumberg and Mellor (1987)] which can treat realistic bottom
topography, atmospheric forcing, free sea surface (for tides and storm surge), and thermohaline
processes. The model computes the three-dimensional currents, sea surface height, temperature,
salinity, and turbulent exchange variables. POM has been implemented in the Japan Sea (and is called
SOJ-POM) with marginal mesoscale eddy-resolution. Thus, it should be capable of treating most (if
not all) of the key circulation processes enumerated above. Here, results from the beginning of a long-
term campaign are described; namely, some of the properties of the initial spin-up are discussed.
202
THE JAPAN SEA MODEL
SOJ-POM uses realistic bottom topography from DBDB5 (extending to 20 m at the coastline),
a rectangular grid with 10 km resolution in the south and 7.5 km resolution in the north, sigma
(terrain-following) coordinates with 15 vertical levels, and Levitus (1982) climatological annual mean
temperature and salinity fields. Thus, it has marginal mesoscale eddy-resolution, because the Rossby
baroclinic radius of deformation varies from about 17 km in the south to about 8 km in the north.
Geostophically-balanced, climatological mean inflow of 2.8 Sv (plus temperature and salinity) through
the Korean Straits is specified, and outflows of 2.24 Sv and 0.56 Sv through Tsugaru and Soya Straits,
respectively (where a radiation boundary condition is also applied) are designated. For the initial
simulation, climatological mean wind stress from Hellerman and Rosenstein (1983) has been applied,
and the sea surface temperature and salinity have been clamped to the Levitus climatology. The
Mellor-Yamada (1982) level-21h vertical turbulence closure and Smagorinsky (1963) lateral turbulence
closure [with adjustable proportionality constant (HORCON) equal to 0.1] schemes have been utilized.
The horizontal integration is on the Arakawa C-grid, vertical time-integration is implicit, and the
horizontal time-integration is explicit, split-mode, with a barotropic mode time step of 10 sec. and a
baroclinic mode time step of 5 min. The integrations are being carried out on a DEC-Alpha
workstation and have been run for 190 days. Early results are also presented from a prognostic 100-
day run with a 100-day relaxation of surface temperature and salinity to the Levitus climatology.
INITIAL SPIN-UP OF SOJ-POM
It is of interest to compare the simulation after 190 days of spin-up with the initial condition.
Based on the total and eddy kinetic energy (averaged over the volume) versus time (Fig. 1), the model
spun-up to statistical equilibrium in about 80 days and undergoes oscillations (due to instabilities) on a
timescale of about a month. The surface dynamic height relative to 1,500 m (not shown) from the
Levitus climatology (used to initialize SOJ-POM) indicates a broad, weak northeastward surface
geostrophic flow from the Korean Coast to the Japanese Coast, which is, of course, consistent with the
general circulation; however, the pattern is devoid of the boundary currents and subpolar jet is
expected from observations. In contrast, the sea surface height at Day 190 in the prognostic
calculation (Fig. 2a) indicates a strong East Korean Warm Current, Nearshore Branch (along Japanese
Coast), Middle Branch, and two meandering subpolar jets associated with the bifurcation of the East
Korean Warm Current, to be discussed below. There are also several mesoscale eddies or gyres. The
surface dynamic height relative to 1,500m (proportional to the approximate baroclinic stream function),
computed from the prognostic mass field at Day 190, has an overall pattern and magnitude similar to
the sea surface height (Fig. 2b). Compared to a dynamic height difference of about 30 cm across the
basin, the difference (barotropic geostrophic) field (Fig. 2c) between sea surface height and surface
dynamic height is characterized by anomalies (due to mesoscale eddies and gyres) of typically up to 6
to 8 cm, indicative of the importance of the deep flow and its interaction with bottom topography. The
depth-integrated (barotropic) stream function (not shown; similar in pattern to Fig. 2c) is dominated by
strong anticyclonic and cyclonic gyres over the deep basin north of 40N. Somewhat weaker cyclonic
gyres occurred over basins (Ulleung, Yamato, and southwestern Japan Basins, respectively) off the
Korean, Japanese, and southern Primorsky Coasts, plus a mid-basin anticyclonic gyre centered at 39N,
134E over the Yamato Rise and other anticyclonic gyres, generally over rises, are secondary features.
The throughflow follows the Japanese Coast. Further details on the basin-scale circulation are given in
Mooers and Kang (1995); here other aspects are emphasized: circulation near the inflow and outflow
ports, time series and vertical profiles of velocity, etc. at key locations, and a few comparisons of the
effects of surface clamping versus 100-day surface relaxation.
203
The surface currents for in the inflow (Fig. 3) and outflow (Fig. 4) subdomains undergo
substantial adjustment from the initial condition (10 day diagnostic run) to 10 days and 190 days of the
prognostic run. The inflow is split by Tsushima Island and flows mainly along the Japanese Coast as
the Nearshore Branch at Day 10 in the diagnostic run, which is the initial condition for the prognostic
run. The East Korean Warm Current and Nearshore Branch developed by Day 10 in the prognostic
run. A strong cyclonic meander in the East Korean Warm Current developed just downstream of
Tsushima Straits by Day 190 in the prognostic run. For the outflow subdomain, equatorward coastal
flow feeds the outflow through both Tsugaru and Soya Straits by Day 10 in the diagnostic run. The
equatorward coastal flow intensifies and becomes connected to the offshore flow by Day 10 in the
prognostic run. A large anticyclonic meander of the subpolar jet feeds the outflow through Tsugaru
Strait by Day 190 in the prognostic run. Obviously, there are strong, complex, and variable cross-
isobath flows in the vicinity of the inflow and outflow ports, and it would be useful to understand
them.
For several selected levels, time series of currents (Fig. 5) at two grid points (S4 and S5) near
CREAMS current meter moorings demonstrate the magnitude and nature of the flow, which varies on a
time scale of ca. 1 month. In the upper layer (above 22 m) at S4, the speed is often at least 0.2 ms',
while in the interior (between 480 and 1,920 m) the speed is generally less than 0.2 ms'. In contrast,
in the upper layer (above 25m) at S5, the speed is generally less than 0.2 ms-', while in the interior
(between 540 and 2,160 m) the speed is often at least 0.2 ms'. At both S4 and S5 the interior flow is
highly (visually) coherent, but the upper layer and deepest level flows are only partially coherent with
the interior flow. Thus, there is strong barotropic and shallow baroclinic mesoscale variability, plus
variability apparently localized to the surface and bottom layers.
At Day 190, the vertical profiles of velocity (Fig. 6) at S4 and S5 have quite different
characteristics. For example, at S4, the zonal velocity is westwards (at about 0.Ims') in the upper half
of the water column, with a linear shear in the lower half that leads to a reversal to eastward below
2,500 m, and the meridional and vertical velocities are very weak. In contrast, at S5, the zonal
velocity decreases from about 0.03ms' eastward near surface to nearly zero below 500 to 1,700 m,
where it increases to about 0.1ms' near bottom. The meridional velocity is poleward at 0.02 to
0.08ms' between 200 m below the surface and above the bottom; and the vertical velocity (which is
normal to the sigma surfaces) has a downward maximum of 0.2ms' at 3,000 m (and requires more
analysis). At both S4 and S5, the thermocline is largely confined to the upper 400 m and the halocline
to the upper 100 m.
A few results at Days 30 and 100 (Figs. 7 and 8, respectively) from a prognostic case in
progress with a 100-day relaxation time-scale (vice clamping) of the surface thermohaline forcing,
illustrate the emerging character of what is expected to be a superior simulation. (This case spun-up to
statistical equilibrium in ca. 50 days and at an eddy kinetic energy level about one-half that of the
clamped case.) For example, the sea surface height (Figs. 7b and 8b; to be compared with the
evolution of the clamped case in Figs. 7a and 8a) has a single subolar jet that separates at 38°N and
meanders (gently at Day 30 and vigorously at Day 100) to exit through Tsugaru Straits. There are
cyclonic and anticyclonic circulation gyres over the Japan Basin, and there is a cyclonic gyre over the
Ulleung (but not the Yamato) Basin. However, comparing Day 100 with Day 30, considerable
mesoscale evolution is probably still in progress at mesoscale Day 100.
SUMMARY
Many of the major features of the general circulation of the Japan Sea are revealed in the
simulations, and it is clear that flow interaction with bottom topography (JEBAR effect) is an important
204
factor.
However, there are number of improvements
to be expected, such as, full separation of the
East Korean Warm Current
at a lower latitude (ca. 38° to 41°N),
as now appears to be emerging in the
case of surface relaxation
(vice clamping).
Improvements are anticipated when
the model is run with seasonally-varying wind
stress
[possibly with the improved climatology
provided by Na (1992)] and surface heat and moisture fluxes.
It may also be necessary to increase
the horizontal resolution, and possibly the vertical
resolution and
positioning of sigma levels,
to account better for the mesoscale variability, especially
the smaller
(shallow and transient) mesoscale eddies
and fronts, and to minimize the effects of spurious horizontal
pressure gradients over steep bottom topography.
Another level of improvement
can be expected when the model is forced with synoptic wind
stress and heat and moisture fluxes, and with river
runoff. Then it will be possible to explore the
very
important wintertime deep convection
process, perform energetics calculations for eddy-mean flow
interactions, and compare the
model output with observations from the CREAMS
Program. At that
point, the stage will be set for data assimilation
(with satellite radar altimetric
sea surface heights,
etc.), and for development of
a nowcast/forecast system.

Influence of Ice Production on the Deep Water Formation in the Japan Sea
Lev P. YAKUNIN
Department of Oceanography, Far Eastern State University, Vladivostok, Russia
The main ice-forming areas in the Japan Sea are the Tatarsky Strait and Peter the Great Gulf.
More than 90% of ice is produced in winter in the first region and this process occurs the most
intensively in February. During that month ice covers 3, 6 and 11% of sea surface, respectively in a
warm, temperate, and severe winter. At the same time ice volume changes from 2 to 6 cubic
kilometers, with the average of 3 cubic kilometers. Ice is formed to the north off the Strait and, under
the influence of wind and streams, moves to the south at an average speed of 11 miles a day. After 15-
30 days it reaches the ice edge that is usually situated at 49°N. Further to the south ice starts breaking
noticeably.
Assuming that the Tatarsky Strait is divided in two parts by 49°N and taking into account the
thickness, concentration, hummock, and the speed of ice drift, we can estimate the amount of ice
crossing a selected range:
V; = A*L(h + Ah) v and Ah = 0.25T*h (1)
where:
V; - ice volume, cubic kilometers;
A - concentration level, decimals;
L - width of the Strait at 49°N, kilometers;
h - average ice thickness, kilometers;
Ah increase in ice thickness due to hummock, kilometers;
T - level of hummock, /in 5-level scale/;
v - speed of ice drift, kilometers per 10 days.
Based on a 26-year (1964-1989) data set we found that the volume of ice moved from north to south
beyond 49°N during the "ice lifetime" varies from 12 to 53 cubic kilometers, with the average of 31
cubic kilometers. Martin et al (1972) reported the value of about 25 cubic kilometers a year for the
volume of ice formed in 1988-1990, that is comparable with our calculations.
The amount of salt entering the water during the ice formation period can be computed by the
simple formula:
S, = O,*V; (S,. - S). (2)
where:
S, - amount of salt going into the water, tons;
0; - density of ice, tons per cubic meter;
V; - ice volume, cubic kilometers;
S, - salinity ('/..)of the surface-water;
Si - salinity (°/,) of ice.
215
Taking V; from (1), 8; = 0.9 tons
m-3,
SSW =32.5'/. and Si =5 °l.. based on our measurements in
the northern part of Tatarsky Strait and Sakhalin Gulf, we evaluated the annual numbers of S, and the
average value equal to 775* 106 tons.
During the process of ice formation, only about 15% of salt remains in ice whereas the major
part goes to increase salinity of the surface water and enables consecutive mixing. As a result, the
surface water has T, S - indexes typical for the deep water of the Japan Sea. The volume of deep water
formed due to ice production is given by following equation:
Vdw =
Ss
(3)
where:
Odw . Sdw - Ow Ssw
Vd,,
- volume of deep water formed, cubic kilometers;
SS - amount of salt brought into water (calculated by eq.2), tons;
9d,,, and B,,,, - density of deep and surface water, respectively, tons per cubic meter;
Sd,, and SS,,, - salinity of deep water and surface-water, respectively, (°/.).
In accordance with the characteristics of deep (Sd,, = 34.08 °/,. and Td, = 0.5°C) and surface
(Ss,, =32.5 °/°O and Ts,9 = -1.7°C) waters, the corresponding densities are equal to Odw = 1.02738 and
95,,, = 1.02614 tons per cubic meter (Oceanological Tables, 1975). Our further calculations
demonstrated that for the period of observations the volume
Vd,,
changes from 185 to 807 cubic
kilometers, with the average value of 470 cubic kilometers (Fig. 1).
The amount of ice from other sources in the Japan Sea does not exceed 10% of the square and
the volume of ice produced in the Tatarsky Strait. Therefore, in average the volume of deep water
originated, because of ice formation, in the entire Japan Sea is under 550 cubic kilometers. This
number accounts for less than 0.1 % of the Sea volume and cannot significantly effect the hydrological
properties of the Sea as a whole. Near the northwestern coast, within the shelf of Peter the Great Gulf
and Tatarsky Strait, ice formation seems to have considerable influence on the thermohaline structure
of water.

Exogenous Succession of the Southwestern Sakhalin Algal Communities
Lubov A. BALKONSKAYA
Sakhalin Research Institute of Fisheries & Oceanography
196, Komzomolskaya Street, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Russia, 693016
The southwestern Sakhalin is a traditional harvesting region for Laminariajaponica. Recently,
the commercial importance of this region decreased due to a reduction of the area occupied by algae.
Shifts in species distribution have resulted in a change of the species mix from the past.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Data was collected and processed using the method of Kalugina-Gutnick (1975). Photo surveys
were carried out in 1965-1967, 1990, and the data was analyzed using VNIICAM (Sorokin and others,
1987). Algal samples were also collected by divers in 1963 (Sarochan, 1963), 1988-1944
(SakhTINRO, SakhNIRO).
RESULTS
Macrophytobenthos of southwest Sakhalin consists of 242 species, 41 species related to
Chlorophyta, 70 to Phaeophyta, and 131 to Rhodophyta (Klochkova,1994). Macrophyte distribution
depends on bottom type near the southwestern coast of Sakhalin where abrasion terraces or "benches",
all without alluvium are found on the underwater shore slope. Bare rocky surfaces are zones of active
hydrodynamic processes. Benches are found along all the southwestern coast of Sakhalin but
interrupted by bays and inlets at river mouths where a thin layer of alluvium is observed. The
southwestern littoral zone had little alluvium because the rivers and streams are small. Soils, mainly
sand, which is moved some kilometres occurs near the Cape of Slepikovsky and the Cape of Lopatino.
Hydrological conditions of southwest Sakhalin littoral zone are generally determined by two
currents, the West Sakhalin and the Tsushima. Waters of the Tsushima Current enter into the Tatar
Strait around Moneron Island from the west and swung to the south along the coast into the La Perouse
Strait. Waters of the Okhotsk Sea enter into the Japan Sea and move along the north coast creating a
tidal current of cold-water near southwest Sakhalin (up to the Cape of Windis) (Budaeva, 1981).
The algae habitat is along the coast at depths of 0.5-15 m. Three algal communities, two
three-strata, and one one-stratum were delineated. One community is located near Sadovniki-
Gornozavodsk at depths of 0.5-1.5 m (Fig. 1). The upper stratum is large brown algae (Laminaria
japonica, Laminaria cichorioides, Costaria costata, Cystoseira crassipes). Laminaria japonica is the
dominant species in both biomass (2,000 g/sq.m in avarage) and in the frequency of occurrence. This
community was named Laminaria japonica. The species most common to the middle stratum are
Dichloria viridis, Rhodymenia pertusa, Tichocarpus crinitus, Ptilota filicina, Chondrus pinnulatus,
Ulva fenestata, Monostroma grevillei and others. The algae which dominates the lower stratum are
Bossiela cretacea, Corallina filifermis and cortical algae of genus Melobesia. For more than a year 30
species of macrophytes were found in this community.
221
A second community was located near Gornozavodsk, the Cape of Krilyon at depths of 1-10 m.
It contains many-stratum and differs from the first area as Alaria marginata and Laminaria angustata.
Laminariajaponica appeared in the upper stratum. Alaria marginata is not the most abundant but we
called this community Alaria. The middle and lower stratum species structure is similar to the first
community.
A third community was delineated as one-stratum composed of red corallina algae of species
Corallina, Bossiela, Melobesia and Lithothamnion which we called the Corallina community. This
community is located in the littoral zone near the village Sadovniki-Town Nevelskb but deeper in the
water than the Laminaria community at depths of 2-10 m.
Analysis of data from the southwest Sakhalin near the village of Sadovniki-town Nevelsk
indicats that exogenous succession occurred. The Laminaria community which only occurs in the most
shallow part of bench at depths of 0.5-1.5 m was replaced by Corallina. This change is clearly seen in
Fig. 2 where the algae distribution at the villages Yablochnoye-Antonovo is shown.
Limits of the
Laminaria distribution were determined with great precision. Table 1 shows the reduced distribution
of Laminaria in the zone.
Laminaria japonica is locate on the tops of ridges where spring ice can cutoff the second year
thallus. This causes Laminariajaponica to have a one-year cycle which can adversily affect the stock
state as the biomass of one-year plants is smaller than second year plants. The horizontal distribution
of succession rapidly takes place in a southerly direction. In 1994 succession occurred near Sadovniki-
Kalinino and in 1995 the southern limit of the Corallina community reached Nevelsk (Fig. 3).
Succession also occurs near southwest Sakhalin which could have been caused by changes in
the Tsushima Current found by Komaki (1988). If this hypothesis is true, the Corallina species
movement along the coast will continue to the south up to the Cape of Windis.
Another possible
explanation for the succession could be the presence of dense accumulations of urchins (Nabata and
others, 1992). Near Sadovniki-town Nevelsk the urchin (Strongylocentrotus intermedius) is mainly
phytophagous. Last year, the reproduction of Laminariajaponica likely exceeded the algae consumed
by urchins. The most dense urchin accumulations aree at 1-5 m in the Corallina community and these
urchins are feeding on Corallinaceae. The succession may have been caused by the intensive use of
concrete to develop 12% of the shoreline of the village Sadovniki-town Nevelsk. The direct influence
of concrete on the development of algae has not studied however.

INTRODUCTION
Sakhalin Island shelf is an area where a number of fisheries for bottom and pelagic species
occur. The region also has a great potential for oil and gas exploitation and needs to have an
ecological monitoring system developed to monitor exploration and production to prevent possible
negative effects on marine organisms. Five expeditions to the North Sakhalin Island shelf have been
carried out by FERHRI scientists in 1990, 1991 and 1994. Background data on pollutant concen-
trations and the characteristics of the benthos and phyto and zooplankton were collected (Tkalin, 1993;
Tkalin and Belan, 1993).
Phytoplankton samples were collected from the surface layer and zooplankton was sampled
from the bottom to surface during the daytime using a large Jeday net. Two benthos samples were
taken at each station using a Van-Veen grab (0.11 m2) or modified Petersen grab (0.25 m2).
PHYTO AND ZOOPLANKTON
In 1990-1991, twenty four species of diatoms and flagellates were collected; 23 species are
typical of marine waters and one (Glenodinium pilula) of brackish waters. The spatial distribution of
phytoplankton is not uniform. In 1990, the maximum values of phytoplankton biomass and abundance
(7,907 mg/m3 and 454,500 ind/1) are in the northern part of study area and minimum values (262
mg/m3 and 7,700 ind./1) are at the southern periphery. In 1991, high values of biomass and density of
phytoplankton are in the northern part of study area (1,046 mg/m3 and 22,100 ind/1) as well as in the
south (2,082 mg/m3, 16,600 ind/1). In 1990 and 1991, the diatom Nitzshia seriata is dominant
(biomass) in the northern periphery and the flagellates Protoperidinium granii and Gyrodinium lacryma
are dominant in the southern part of study area.
Zooplankton in the study area is mainly copepods (up to 88% from total abundance). The
biomass and abundance of zooplankton decreases from the north to the south. In 1990, maximum
values are about 1,660 mg/m3 and 17,789 ind/m3 and the minimum values are about 745 mg/m3 and
11,315 ind/m3 respectively. In 1991, the spatial distribution and abundance of zooplankton is the same
as in 1990 but the seston biomass was three times lower.
In general the status of the plankton community is considered to be normal except for an area
where the zooplankton is affected by an oil spill that caused a reduction of more than 40% of plankton
(B.M. Borisov, personal communication).

BENTHOS
Benthos samples were collected along the North Sakhalin Island shelf in 1990-1991 and in
1994. In 1990 and 1991, the highest biomass (1,600 g/m2) is in the northern part of study area, with
the average biomass being more than 500 g/m2. The sea urchin Echinarachnius parma
(Echinodermata) is the most abundant. Minimum values of biomass (13 g/m2) were detected in the
southern part of study area where Polychaeta and Actiniaria dominated. In general Echinodermata and
Bivalvia are the most abundant (biomass) in the investigated area.
In 1994, benthos samples were collected from four polygons along the North Sakhalin Island
shelf (Table 1). Data on the distribution of the benthos biomass are presented in Table 2. Polygon A
is situated in the Sakhalin Bay, close to the Amur River mouth and the average biomass is 56 g/m2.
Echinodermata is absent except for Stegophiura brachyactis (Ophiuroidea) and the Crustacea,
Polychaeta and Bivalvia are the most abundant (Table 3). Macrobenthic fauna is typical of brackish
waters.
Polygons B, C and D were situated along the Northeast Sakhalin Island shelf. The biomass in
polygon B ranged from 300 to 8,000 g/m2 with an average of more than 1,300 g/m2.
Sea urchin
Echinarachnius parina are the most abundant (Table 3). At some stations E. parma biomass exceeds
1,000 g/m2 and at one station reached 8,000 g/m2 (abundance 360 ind/m2). The average biomass in
polygon C exceeded 1,500 g/m2, varying from 298 to 2,700 g/m2. E. parma is dominant at all
stations in this area comprising of up to 80% of the total benthos biomass (Table 3). At some stations
the density of E. parma abundance and biomass reached 280 ind/m2 and biomass 3,000 g/m2
respectively. The average biomass in polygon D was 732 g/m2. Sea urchin E. parma is dominant, but
the percentage of the total biomass and frequency of occurrence decreased to 75% and 85%
respectively (Table 3). The percentage of the Bivalvia increased to 13% and the mollusc Tridonta
borealis borealis dominated at two stations.
CONCLUSION
Several expeditions were carried out in 1990-1991 and in 1994 to determine the abundance of
species on the Sakhalin Island shelf. Data collected of benthos and phyto and zooplankton along the
shelf off North Sakhalin Island before commercial oil and gas extraction shows high productivity and
variability of pelagic and bottom communities. Continuous ecological monitoring during the
exploitation of mineral resources is required to determine if negative changes in the marine
environment quality occurs in order to take remedial action if necessary.

Fishery and Oceanographic Database of Okhotsk Sea
Lev N. BOCHAROV, Vladimir K. OZYORIN
Pacific Fishery and Research Centre (TINRO-Centre)
The specific feature of resource research and especially in commercial fishery forecasting is
that field work costs are augmented by the processing of data from commercial and unexploited stocks.
The requirement for providing marine resource data to researchers includes the following:
- planning, organizing and carrying out the vessel cruises;
- collecting data to allow the short and long term forecasting of stocks abundance;
- creating a data base management system for storing, assembling and processing oceanographic
and biological data that can be easily used;
- developing programs to provide analytical and forecasting ability;
- preparing data for analysis and for monthly, quarterly and annual forecasts and for other
practical recommendations.
These requirements are inter related to form a linear sequence of events; a sequential method
for solving problems is a necessity for developing the technology for complex research on ocean bio-
resources. It is possible to solve a number of questions using specialized computer systems developed
for keeping the data with access channels and using the technical and research potentiality of staff to
analyze the data. The data base should be available at all times for the data processing and analyses
and "friendly" programs for complex data analyses should be available. These programs should allow
for simple adaptation to new data and methods, etc. Thus, it should be possible to use an interactive
process where a researcher can obtain current information quickly, process and present the data in a
convenient form, make formal and expert analysis and repeat any stage of the data processing using
new data etc. This paper deals with the state of data management and processing capability for the
Okhotsk Sea resources. Bioproductivity of the Okhotsk Sea is at a high level from analysis of the data
from long-term investigations carried out by TINRO research cruises.
By the early 1980s the monitoring of fishery resources were well developed by TINRO. The
exploratory stage of investigating the North and South Pacific Ocean from Arctic to Antarctic was
completed and the qualitative and quantitative composition of commercial fishing became the central
activity. The main purpose of research is to focus on the establishment of rational fishing practices by
the fishing fleet. A system of regular surveys was introduced to monitor pollock, herring, halibut,
crabs and other species in the Okhotsk Sea.
The ecosystem investigations of 1980s in the Okhotsk Sea developed a better understanding of
the biocenosis, food availability and the interaction of fishery resources. Since 1965, more than 160
cruises in the Okhotsk Sea contribute to the development of a large database that is available for
analysis. The long-term monitoring data make it possible to better understand the dynamic processes
which occur in the Okhotsk Sea and to estimate the influence of fishing pressure on the dynamic
processes and to look at the effects of climate change, etc. Moreover, retrospective analysis of the data
has become more important recently, due to funding shortages.
From early 1981 all data have been saved in a single format in the appropriate database. The
most common formats are:
230
trawl log
specimen
length frequency
hydrological
A large amount of data is kept in the database as shown in Fig. 3. One data base deals with
the distribution of hydrological stations in the northwest parts of Pacific ocean and adjacent seas and
another with the coincident distribution of research trawls in Okhotsk Sea. More than 50,000 trawl
logs were collected from esearch cruises; data on the results of biological analysis of 110,000 species;
7,000 samples of general analysis (one sample consists of 100-200 species) and more than 52,000
hydrological stations are held in the Okhotsk Sea database. The distribution of the biological data on
fished species is shown in Table 1 and the distribution of monthly hydrological observations are shown
in Table 2.
Fisheries statistics are collected in a special database. Monitoring of commercial fishing is
ensured by a special
automatic system for data collected from 60-80% of the commercial fleet. The
captains provide daily information about the fishing operation. The monitoring of fishing has been in
place for 12 years and it has resulted in the development of
a unique data base on the main fishing
areas. Data from 400,000 fishing trips dealing with fishing for pollack, cod, halibut and herring are
kept in the database which include catches and other parameters for all areas. The Software allows
analysis of each parameter for all fishing areas and to study the changes of the parameters with time,
analyze stock density effects and solve a number of other problems related to the fishery. Since 1960,
the data on catches have been kept in the database as annual observations. The database
can be used to
solve simple questions with unrestricted selection of time and space scales to complex analysis of
population state.
The following analyses are the most popular: analysis of the cartography of unstudied
parameters, contouring the size-mass frequency distributions using the annual data, calculating the
climatic norms according to definite squares and calculating anomalies using different characteristics.
The best result of our work is the creation of
a Fishing Areas Catalogue. The Catalogue includes more
than 400 fishing charts of the main areas and parameters of Okhotsk Sea. The Catalogue can be used,
not only by scientists, but by captains of fishing vessels. Using fish distribution charts on board of
vessels can allow captains to fish more effectively by selecting the best fishing grounds to improve
catches while saving time and fuel. The creation of
a Catalogue of Far Eastern Seas is possible using
data available for all fish species from each research cruise. The
surveys are often carried out through
international cooperation by combining the efforts of scientists from interested countries to include
their information sources, computer techniques, funding and printing facilities.
The information available on computers could be doubled if data collected in the 1960-80s
period is added to the current data base. Our plans, for the
near future, are to increase our efforts to
put this data on the computer. In conclusion, it should be noted that developing the fishery biological
database continues to be an ongoing process.

Interannual Dynamics of the Epipelagic Ichthyocen Structure
in the Okhotsk Sea
Victor V. LAPKO
Pacific Research Fisheries Centre (TINRO-Centre)
From the beginning of the 1990s, the oceanography changes in the northern Pacific due to
changes in the level of water exchange between the Okhotsk Sea and Pacific Ocean and, consequently,
the sea current intensity. The abundance of common species changes and these fluctuations differs
from the long-term interannual variability. The present time period is interpreted as "cold" similar to
the 1940-60s cold period (Shuntov et al. 1996).
Climate change in the Sea of Okhotsk is thought to have resulted from a long-term change of
atmospheric circulation over the northern Pacific and a decrease in the intensity of water exchange
between Okhotsk Sea and Pacific Ocean. The West Kamchatka and East Sakhalin Currents which
indicate water inflow and outflow are weaker than in the previous ten years. The influence of the cold
dichothermal layer becomes more apparent as a consequence of the decrease in the warm Pacific water
inflow. Taking into consideration this reasoning, the present period is thought to be cold and the
impact on the epipelagic fish community was found to be as follows:
1. the walleye pollock abundance decreases 2-3 times;
2. the herring abundance increases 4-5 times;
3. subtropical fishes such as pacific sardine and anchovy discontinue migrating into the southern
Okhotsk Sea in summer;
4. the abundance of the pacific salmon increases over the last two years.
Increases in abundance of some fish species did not compensate for the decreases in walleye-
pollock, thus, the total fish biomass in the epipelagic layer is still approximately 1.5 times lower
(Table 1). A number of studies have been carried out on changes in the nekton composition but little
is known about changes in the community structural. Data collected during the last combined surveys
allow estimates of the total consumption of fish, the composition of food and the long-term dynamics.
The epipelagic fish community of the Okhotsk Sea consists of walleye-pollock (about 6.0
mln.t), herring (2.5 mln.t), capelin (0.08 mln.t), salmon (pink and chum, 0.48 min.t) and northern
smoothtongue (deep-sea smelt 1.2 mln.t). In comparison with the 1980s the main changes in the fish
community composition occurs due to a decrease in abundance of walleye pollock while the herring
increases. In previous years, walleye pollock in the southern deep basin is about 1.5-2.0 min.t in the
summer. Subtropical fishes such as sardine and anchovy stopped migrating to the southern Okhotsk
Sea. Salmon and northern smoothtongue are the only abundant species there. The total fish biomass
in the epipelagic layer, in the southern Okhotsk Sea, decreases approximately 2-3 times. In the
northern Okhotsk Sea, the total fish biomass decreases insignificantly (15-20%) because both walleye-
pollock and herring remain comparatively abundant. Therefore, fish distribution in the epipelagic
layer increases northward relative to the long-term trends in species abundance.
The data show that the species composition has significantly changed and total fish daily diet
decreases insignificantly from 568 th.t to 511 th.t in comparison with the 1980s (Fig. 1). Euphausiids
decrease from.57 to 28% due to T.longipes, while amphipods increase from 7.5 to 17.3%, pteropods
237
from 0.8 to 9.2%, and copepods and forage fish stay at about the same level of abundance.
The
walleye pollock share of food resources stays stable while the capelin share increases two times and the
mesopelagic fishes decreases six times. Other hydrobionts consume less than 1 % of the total available
food. Such changes in the total diet are due to the affect of fluctuations of key species in both the
plankton and nekton. Thus, the trophic structure including fish distribution throughout Okhotsk Sea is
influenced by the oceanographic conditions. Further, Walleye pollock eat about 80% of the total daily
diet in the 1980s. Currently, in summer, walleye-pollock and herring consume almost equal amounts
48 and 44% respectively (Fig. 2). Although the condition of each species differs, as herring had a
higher ration value of about 9% of body weight in comparison with about 4% for pollock.
CONCLUSION
Currently, walleye-pollock and herring are key nekton species utilizing most of the organic
matter in the epipelagic layer of Okhotsk Sea, though the walleye pollock abundance has
declined
considerably. Taking into account that these two species are more abundant in the northern Okhotsk
Sea, availability determines the total diet composition.
In comparison with the 1980s, the total
consumption decreases insignificantly throughout the whole epipelagic layer of the Okhotsk Sea, but
recently a difference between the north and south appears to be because of the northward shift of fish
species biomass. Though the total fish biomass in the epipelagic layer decreases by about 1.5 times,
the quantity of organic material passing through fish remains almost the same.

Quantitative Seasonal and Year-to-Year Changes of Phytoplankton
in the Okhotsk Sea and off Kuril Area of the Pacific
Valentina I. LAPSHINA
Pacific Scientific Research Fisheries Centre (TINRO-centre)
4, Shevchenko Alley, Vladivostok, 690600, Russia
Data from 1353 Jady plankton net samples collected over 4 years from the upper layer of the
Okhotsk Sea and adjacent Pacific Ocean areas were analysed (Fig. 1). The net is made of kapron with
a mesh size of 0.168 mm and mouth diameter 37 cm. Tows were carried out in the
0-50 in and 0-200
in (bottom) levels. Phytoplankton was separated from zooplankton by a set of sieves
("Recomendations...",1984). The data were averaged by 1-degree squares and biostatistical areas (Fig.
1) (Volkov, 1986; Shuntov et al., 1993). The organisms sampled were separated into the different
genera for analysis.
During the period of the investigation diatom algae are the most abundant.
The "bloom" is
caused by intensive development of Chaetoceros and Thalassiothrix.
Peridinium is noted as single
cells.
In 1993, three overlapping surveys are carried out by 3 vessels to estimate seasonal
phytoplankton distribution (Fig. 2) and biomass (Tables 2, 3 & 4).
Anomalous oceanographic
condition were found due to a lack of water influx into the Okhotsk sea through the northern Kuril
Straits (Shuntov, 1994), which causes sea surface temperatures of 9-10 degrees, 1-1.5 degrees lower
than in 1991.
In area 13-a (above shelf water of the central and southern Kuril Islands), the phytoplankton
abundance within the 50 in layer is the richest.
The average phytoplankton biomass for all three
surveys is at a maximum in the area and concentrations increase 4.2 times between
July and August
from 1,242-4,980-5,250 mg/m3. The total phytoplankton concentration in the area increases from
4.6-
18.3-19.3 bin.t. The same is observed in area 12 where the biomass of plankton during the second
survey is 1.7 times higher than the first (2,050 and 1,242 mg/m3). At the same
time the quantity of
silicon in both areas decreases from 10-20 to 5-6 mg-at./l and phosphates from 0.8-1.0 to 0.2-0.4 mkg-
at/1. The difference in phytoplankton biomass between areas is most evident in the third survey. For
instance, in areas 10 and 11 phytoplankton is almost non existent, in area 12, it is more than 1,000
mg/m3 and in area 13 more than 5,000 mg/m3.
In the Pacific, maximum biomass of phytoplankton occurs during the second survey (7,320,
8,152 and 5,800 mg/m3) but the average biomass gradually increases between July and August, from
the first survey to the third from 819 to 1,390 and to 1,470 mg/m3.
In 1993, the biomass of phytoplankton in the Okhotsk sea and in the Pacific is 2-5 times higher
than in other years.
In conclusion, the distribution of plankton is patchy which is caused by the complex
oceanographic conditions.
The highest biomass of phytoplankton is in areas above the shelf and in
upwelling zones. The data confirms that the Sakhalin-Kuril region continues to be a highly productive
area. Seasonal Bogorovs index varies from 0 to 4,540, thus, the plankton community appears
to be in
a different stage of seasonal succession in different parts of the region from spring to
mid-summer.
240
Changes in abundance continues from April through to September - October depending on
environmental condition in the main part of the Okhotsk Sea.

(Northern Part of Okhotsk Sea)

In August 1993 (244' cruise of the R/V " Alexander Nesmeyanov") the contents of mercury in
the water, plankton and bottom sediments in some regions of the Okhotsk Sea were investigated. The
research was conducted on the western Kamchatka shelf at the entrance to Shelikhov Bay and in the
Tauisky Sakhalin region. Mercury is estimated using cold vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometry
(Hatch and Ott, 1968). The mercury level in the sea water is determined following Virtsavs et al.,
1974 and Mercury ..., 1979. The determination of mercury in plankton and bottom sediments is based
on using standard methods (Oradovsky, 1977; GOST ..., 1986).
Analysis of the data indicates that mercury in the upper layer of the water column is rather
homogeneous and the concentration ranges from 0.000 to 0.042 mcg/l (average 0.019 mcg/1) (Fig. 1).
The relatively low mercury content of the water is observed in all regions. The upper microlayer of
water had 1.6 times the mercury content of the lower layer (Fig. 2). The maximum concentration of
mercury (0.070 mcg/1) is found in the entrance to Shelikhov Bay. Abnormally high concentrations of
mercury (0.600 mcg/1) is found in the bottom layer of water of the entrance to Shelikhov Bay which
was 6 times more than in marine fisheries waters (The collection ..., 1991) (Fig. 3).
In the bottom sediments, the concentrations of mercury ranges from 0.006 to 0.028 mcg/g of
dry mass in association with the granulometric composition. The concentrations of mercury in
plankton ranges from 0.036 to 0.121 mcg/g of dry mass. In the high mercury concentration 1 m
bottom layer of water, similar increases in the concentration of mercury is found associated with
bottom sediments and plankton.
The data suggest that a spatial mercury anomaly coincids with the location of a strong cyclonic
eddy of the Jamsky current moving out from Shelikhov Bay. The surface waters are to a high degree
satiated with oxygen (up to 138%) as a result of the high biomass of the diatom Thalassiosira. This
diatom has the highest mitotic index for the area.
The maximum concentrations of organic carbon, carbohydrates, organic and mineral forms of
biogenic elements are also found in the region. The maximum amount of chlorophyll "a" and
abnormally high values of primary production are observed. The maximum biomasses of bacteria and
infusoria and a large amount of zooplankton (99% of it were larvae of crab) are found along with large
amounts of pollock. The size of algae and zooplankton are unusually large. Similarly, hydrological
and hydrochemical conditions are observed over the Kashevarov Bank where the mercury content in
the water is low. Upwelling of cold bottom waters are enriched by the biogenic elements which are in
higher concentrations than in the entrance to Shelikhov Bay but the biological productivity is lower.
High biological productivity is found in areas where there is upwelling to the surface as the
bottom waters are enriched with nutrients. In these zones, high biomass of phytoplankton and
zooplankton occur along with fish species who feed on the plankton (Natarov, 1966).
247
In the region between the Tauisky Gulf and the entrance to Shelikhov Bay an inter-structural
hydrological front is formed as a result of the interaction between the two currents which move in
opposite directions (Chernyavsky, 1970). In the narrow zone between the flood, the upwelling of cold
deep nutrient rich waters occurs. The constant exchange of nutrients produces an intensive, long
development period of phytoplankton and a large accumulation of zooplankton in the entrance to
Shelikhov Bay (Afanasyev, 1981). Most of the herring stocks and pollock stocks in Okhotsk Sea are
found in the region. A number of studies have found that this area has an extraordinary high stable
biological productivity (Kotlyar, 1970; Chernyavsky, 1970).
A very high abundance and biomass but simplification in the complexity marine organisms can
be found in a polluted environment.
The hyper development of some species and the decrease of
species composition are a reaction to extremely high levels of nutrients and high levels of pollutants
that favors only some species.
Organisms living near volcanic activity on the sea-bottom where high
levels some chemicals (including mercury) can cause a decrease of biological activity and reproduction
(Tarasov et al., 1985).
Some levels of mercury may increase the length of hydrobionts life, stimulate their activity and
cause strengthening of exchange processes (Weis et al., 1985; Weis et
al., 1987). Natural selection
may cause some organisms, that live in high concentrations of mercury, to
become more resistant to
pollution stress (Baker et al., 1985).
The above experiment shows that the interaction of natural
geochemical anomalies as well as antropogenic influences may cause an adaptation of populations
of
hydrobionts to allow them to live in a polluted environment.

Origin of Hydrocarbons in the Ecosystem of Coastal Region
of the Okhotsk Sea
Inna A. NEMIROVSKAYA
Institute of Oceanology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia
The industrial development of oil and gas deposits at the Okhotsk Sea shelf has been
started recently. Authentic information about distribution and origin of hydrocarbons (HC) is
necessary to evaluate both the oil and gas development prospects and ecological rates setting of
anthropogenic pressure on marine environment.
Our study included investigations of the concentration and composition distribution of
dissolved and particulate aliphatic hydrocarbons (AHC) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHC) in the surface waters and bottom sediments. The observations were carried out near
the Kuril Islands, along the east coast of the Okhotsk Sea, in the Gulf of Sakhalin and on the
N.E. Sakhalin Island shelf in August 1993 aboard the R/V Academic Alexander Nesmeyanov
(cruise AN24). The last two areas were surveyed repeatedly during the 23rd cruise of the R/V
Academic Mikhail Lavrentev in the fall of 1994. The purpose of this research is to establish
the background characteristics and level of petrogenic hydrocarbons in these coastal zones.
The average concentration of dissolved aliphatic HC in surface waters collected from
different regions of the Okhotsk Sea varied within a relatively narrow range: from 15 to
19 µg11 in summer, 1993, and from 21 to 33 µg/1 in autumn, 1994; the degree of enrichment
in the surface microlayer (ML) changed from 1.2 to 6.6 (Table). As have been shown earlier
(Tkalin, 1993) the HC content in the water column and bottom sediments is not very high and
comparable with the other regions of the N.W. Pacific. Along the N.E. Sakhalin Island shelf,
the average AHC concentrations were from 9 to 15 µg/l in different seasons, with maximum
value of 44 µg/1. The state of the benthic and pelagic environments appeared to be normal
except for the area affected by a local oil spill.
The mean level of dissolved PAHC in the surface coastal waters was 8 µg/1, with the
degree of their enrichment in the ML from 2 to 3. Naphthalene and fluoranthene dominated in
PAHC composition whereas pyrene and benzo(a)pyrene remained minor components.
These data probably represent the background concentrations for the Okhotsk Sea.
The removal from the coast in the offshore direction and from the river-sea boundary in the
Gulf of Sakhalin did not significantly affect the distribution of dissolved HC, but their
suspended (particulate) form. The distribution pattern of alkanes in waters near the Kuril
Islands and the eastern shelf of the Okhotsk Sea indicated the natural origin of HC with various
ratio of autochthonous and auochthonous components.
Bottom sediments in the coastal regions of the Okhotsk Sea are characterized by low
concentrations of aliphatic HC in comparison with less productive aquatories. In the surface
layer of the bottom sediments the average content of AHC changed from 3.8 to 19.6 µg/g
(calculated on dry weight) and represented from 0.07 to 0.80% of organic carbon (Cg)
253
whereas the average PAHC content varied from 2.2 to 43.1 p.g/g and from 0.3 to 14.3x10-'%
in C. These values remained within the range of concentration (1.5 to 52 µg/g) found in
bottom sediments of the Bering Sea by Venkatesan and Kaplan (1982).
The reported
concentrations of HC can be explained by comparatively low organic matter contents in the
sediments which, in turn, can be related to the short vegetative period of diatom algae, as well
as to the rapid biogenic decomposition of particulate organic matter dominated by proteins
and
carbohydrates (Romankevich, 1984). It is apparent that biological production of the region and
lithology of sediments influence the distribution and composition of hydrocarbons.
In summer 1993 along the N.E. Sakhalin Island shelf (in the region of oil deposits) the
aliphatic HC concentration in surface waters exceeded the background level sevenfold (on
average), and the PAHC content surpassed the background level by 19. The bottom sediments
indicated an increased portion of hydrocarbons in organic matter and a varied HC distribution
pattern. In autumn 1994, in the Gulf of Sakhalin concentrations over 50 .ig/l were observed
in surface as well as in near bottom waters.
The spatial distribution of hydrocarbons and the distribution pattern of alkanes in some
samples suggest the existence of a local source of petroleum pollution on the Sakhalin Island
shelf. However, comparison of the abnormal chromatograms of alkanes from water and
bottom sediments in this area with chromatograms of the Sakhalin petroleum indicates some
basic differences. Even if the Sakhalin petroleum is subjected to weathering (such as would
occur 30 days after a spill on marine waters), alkanes C17 - C,8 will dominate in the
low
molecular area (Mishukov et al., 1987). According to our chromatograms the homologous
compounds up to C,, were practical absent.
Therefore, it is more likely that there is an endogenous source of the abnormal
hydrocarbon concentrations in the bottom core (such as fluid flow). These data were obtained
from the marginal regions which are connected with oil and gas-fields. They are restricted to
very small areas (<1 m2) with a limited depth of oil stratum bedding and with
favorable
tectonic and lithology situations (Venkatesan and Kaplan, 1982; Nesterova and Nemirovskaya,
1988). The analysis of fluid hydrocarbons has shown a high degree of similarity with crude oil
and the HC composition observed in the bottom sediments.
On the other hand, migration of small quantities of low molecular hydrocarbons from
the bottom core with fluid fluxes can promote intensive development of bacterial communities.
This can lead not only to the appearance of the oil oxidizing bacteria, but also the bacteria
which re-synthesize the high molecular alkanes, as was discovered in bottom water samples
collected from the Bering Sea (Nesterova and Nemirovskaya, 1988).
It is quite likely that a natural distillation of petroleum in fluid fluxes takes place in
deep water layers along the Sakhalin shelf, causing the selective accumulation of high
molecular hydrocarbons. The transition of the transformed HC from the bottom sediments to
the water column in shallow areas results in their accumulation in the surface waters.
This
assumption is supported by the similarity of alkanes distribution patterns in water and bottom
sediments, as well as by high concentrations of PAHC at specific stations of this region.
Apparently, the ecosystem of the Okhotsk Sea can endure these natural fluxes of
petroleum hydrocarbons, as evidenced by the background concentration and composition of HC
in the South Sakhalin Island shelf. In addition, there is a high natural rate of the hydrocarbon
biodegradation (mean value 540 µg/1 per day), reflecting a high assimilative capacity for
petroleum hydrocarbons (Anikiev et al., 1992).

ABSTRACT
This paper examines the interannual variability of water temperature and atmospheric
circulation as well as their effect on the distribution of plankton, saury and sardine.
In cold years
(1980-1988), the abundant growth of phytoplankton was observed to negatively affect saury entering
the area because of the florescence but affected sardine positively as it feeds heavily on phytoplankton.
"Warm" years (1970-1979) were characterized by low plankton biomass and rich saury abundance.
INTRODUCTION
Recently (1960-1994), Northwest Pacific saury catches fluctuated up and down while in 1976-
1988 sardine catches underwent a period of increase followed by a decline. In 1960-1969 there was a
periods of medium and small catches of saury in the South Kuril Area (SKA), while in 1970-1979
catches were large and from 1980-1988 catches were extremely poor for saury but good for sardine.
Factors that affect growth and abundance of saury and sardines are water temperature and the state and
distribution of plankton that is the main food of pelagic fish and squid. In turn, the production of these
species are affected by the variability of atmospheric circulation.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
The atmospheric circulation over the Far-East can be analyzed from meridional and zonal
forms of circulation and types of synoptic processes. These processes can be followed from the atlas
for 1949-1985 (Kalachicova and Nikolayeva, 1985). The atlas includes atmospheric circulation from
Ilyinsky (W, C, E, Z) as well as types of atmospheric processes (W, M, E, S). Using the atlas, the
anomalies of atmospheric circulation (in days) and of ground synoptic process types from May to
August, 1978-1985 can be accounted for.
W - western, E - eastern, C - central, M - mixed, Z - zonal, S - southern.
To estimate the long-term variability of the water thermal regime in the SKA, data from the
coastal hydrometeorological stations for 1961-1989 was used. Decadal data on water temperature
distribution near the sea surface and at a depth of 50 in as well as data on plankton within a layer of 0
to 100 m for seven years (July through September 1979-1981, 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1988) were
analyzed.
RESULTS
In accordance with the earlier findings of Bokhan et al (1989), the area is divided into five sites
associated with the heterogeneity of the water masses and of plankton distribution: Site 1; the South
257
Kuril shallows, Site 2; coastal waters adjacent to the Pacific shores of Iturup Island;
Site 4;
Southwestern Pacific and Site 5, Southeastern Pacific (Fig. 1).
From the August distribution of plankton in different years for different sites it is evident that
there were differences in the plankton biomass distribution (Table 1). High value of plankton biomass
for the years is observed northeast of the coastal waters of Iturup Island and Friz Strait. The smallest
values of plankton biomass are observed in the South Kuril shallows and in the ocean .
The interannual variations of plankton biomass over the area was significant.
In coastal waters
of Iturup Island and Friz Strait, the plankton biomass is 1,000 to 7,000 mg/cub.m early in August
1981, and 200 to 1,000 mg/cub.m in August 1978-79.
It is well known that June is the last month of phytoplankton development and August is a
period of the majority of zooplankton development. The maximum zooplankton development
came, as
a rule, 1.5-2 months after the completion of phytoplankton development in a boreal area (Kun,1985).
We observed an extension of plankton productivity cycle except in August 1978-79 when
plankton
development was typical and fit the "biological summer" concept.
The variations in plankton distribution was reflected in the saury and sardines fishery
conditions in the SKA. 1978 and 1979 were characterized by good saury catches (50,000-70,000 t),
whereas in 1980-1988 there were extremely poor (0-10,000 t). At the same time the 1980s were
marked by good catches of Pacific Sardine (250,000-300,000 t). The different responses of saury and
sardine to plankton distribution can be explained by differences in their nutrition. Saury avoided areas
of good phytoplankton development by migrating far from the South Kuril Islands into the ocean,
northeast to the Central Kuril. The sardine diet included a wide variety of both zooplankton and
phytoplankton as was observed in the 1980s (Kun, Shatilina, 1989).
To determine thermal conditions in the SKA, water temperature variation profiles of the
surface and at the 50 m level were developed. An extremely warm year occurred at all sites in 1978.
By early August the water temperature on the coastal of Iturup Island and Friz Strait was I 1 and 13°C,
being 5-10°C in 1980, 1981, 1987 and 1988 (Fig. 2). At the two ocean sites an abnormally high water
temperature of 22°C occurred early in August 1984 and the lowest temperature was 13°C in 1980. In
the South Kuril shallows, water temperature was 14-17°C. Late in July 1979 the water temperature
was 10°C but rose to 16°C by mid August. In the 1980s the water temperature remained below 15°C.
Fig. 3 shows average monthly water temperature anomalies at the Kurilsk and Yuzhno-Kurilsk
hydrometeorological stations in the summer. Two cold periods occurred, the first cold was observed
from 1963 through 1971 and the second from 1980 to 1988. The temperature began to rise in August
1989 and continues to the present.
Variations in the seasonal and interannual plankton biomass were observed in relation to water
temperature variations at all the sites of the SKA.
The highest values of plankton biomass
(phytoplankton bloom) are observed in cold waters of Iturup Island and near Friz Strait (Table 1). The
least values of biomass is observed in the South Kuril shallow waters and at the ocean sites.
In cold
years, in coastal waters of Iturup Island and Friz Strait, the plankton is characterized by a
late
biological spring (extension of biological processes in plankton).
Table 2 shows the data of anomalies in types of bottom processes in 1978-1984. In the years
when water temperature in the coastal waters of SKA is above normal, processes of the western type
dominated over the Sea of Okhotsk and the South Kuril Islands. Thus, in July 1978, the western-type
process comprised 25 days and in August 1979 it was 16 days. The high western-type process, with
cyclone activity dominates the Far-Eastern sea and a high pressure field observed in the Northwest
Pacific provides a transfer of warm air in the area of the Sea of Okhotsk and the Kuril Islands.
In
258
years of low temperature in coastal waters of Kunashir and Iturup, a southern-type process is
intensified providing cold northeastern air masses.
Table 3 represents the data of anomalies of circulation forms by Iliinskiy (1965). From these
data, in 1978, zonal circulation dominates with a high-altitude frontal zone (HFZ) being located to the
north of 40°N. In 1979, a western-type form dominated in the 1980s reiteration of the C and W forms
became important. In May 1983 and 1984 the Z form reiteration is elevated but the HFZ was located
to the south of 40°N. In June and July of 1984 and 1985 the reiteration of the high altitude depression
is abnormally elevated over the Sea of Okhotsk and caused the intensification of an arctic invasions. In
1980 the C form reiteration was abnormally high which was related to the intensification of the
Okhotsk invasion.
DISCUSSION
A cold type of thermal regime, and therefore an abundant development of plankton depends on
the frequency and intensity of cold arctic invasions. Warm types are formed when zonal processes are
intensified causing quick development of plankton.
One of the ways of determining SKA food availability is by forecasting water temperature
which depends on atmospheric processes.

Biota of the Okhotsk Sea: Structure of Communities,
the Interannual Dynamics and Current Status
Vyacheslav P. SHUNTOV, Yelena P. DULEPOVA
Laboratory of Biocenology, Pacific Research Center, Vladivostok, 690600 Russia
The biological resources of the Okhotsk Sea are of great importance to the Russian fishery.
The size of the biological resources is related to the high productivity and lead to increased research
activity on behalf of fishermen. Unfortunately, only TINRO has been engaged in regular research on
the biological resources of the area and these studies are a summarization of a number of papers
including reviews (Shuntov, 1985; Shuntov and Dulepova, 1993; Shuntov et al.,1993). This paper
focuses on the characteristics of the biota during the 1990s. In order to evaluate the long-term
dynamics in the biological phenomena a comparison of the
new information with data of the previous
year is necessary.
These data were obtained from combined surveys conducted between 1980-1990
and from the literature.
In 1980, the relative stability of the composition and structure of the Okhotsk Sea communities
and the biomass and production of major groups of hydrobionts is evident (Table 1).
Based on these
data, the energy balance requirements are calculated and diagrams of the partitioning of the energy
flow between the different levels within the Okhotsk Sea
ecosystem have been constructed (Fig. 1).
The results are approximate and can be only considered
as one of a number of possible variants.
The exchange of energy between the different levels of the food web cannot be explained
unless the detritus cycle is included. The
energy obtained from dead organic substance exceed by 1.5
times that from direct consumption of primary production. The
greatest flow of energy passes through
the bacteria and protozoa which are consumed by zooplankton and non-predatory zoo-benthos (Fig. 1).
The energetic expenditure of bacterial plankton and
protozoa exceed 85% of total respiration of all
heterotrophs of the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem.
The non-predatory zooplankton mainly consist of copepods and euphausids (third in
importance) which are a major energetic reserve for other higher trophic levels. Over 10% of the total
energy flow and heterotrophic production is dependent on this link. The predatory zooplankton
consume up to 65% of the energy and non-predatory zoobenthos, nekton and nektobenthos also depend
on this component of the foodweb.
Twenty five percent of the production of non-predatory
zooplankton, which became part of the detritus
component, replenish the energy reserve of the
ecosystem from which the consumption by non-predatory zooplankton is
more than two times.
Predatory zooplankton consume 27% detritus in their diet. The
rest of the ecosystem components are
less important in utilizing detritus although they contribute
a considerable share of their production to
the cycle.
The demersal fauna (predatory and non-predatory benthos, nektobenthos) of the Okhotsk Sea
consume slightly more than 1 % of the total energy flow. These components of the ecosystem subsist,
mainly, on microflora of the sediments, detritus , protozoa and bacterial plankton, although the pelagic
animals are part of the nekton benthos ration, the greater part is consumed by demersal fishes and
crabs (bentophags and predators) (Dulepova and Borets,1994).
Taking into consideration fishing
effects, the transformation of the demersal fauna production into detritus is much
higher than for
263
zooplankton: non-predatory, zoobenthos more than 40%, predatory zoobenthos more than 80% and
nektobenthos more 50%. Thus, a considerable part of the production of the ecosystem components (20
to 63%) is not utilized and turns into detritus but a lesser amount of organic substance goes to detritus
than is consumed. The Ohkotsk Sea produces excess detritus which is related to the high level of
phytopankton and protozoa production.
In the early 1990s, a climatic change took place in the pelagic zone of the Far-Eastern Seas
analogous to a period from 1940s-1960 as changes from 1970-1980s is analogous to a period from
1920-1930s (Shuntov, 1993; Shuntov et al.,1993). In the 1990s, the pelagic community was
considered to be in transition.
ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES
Data on zooplankton for 1980-1990s was mainly only available from the southern Okhotsk Sea
(Tables 1-2). In the early 1990s, the number of predatory plankton and euphausids increased but the
number of copepods declined. The decline of the plankton communities in the early 1990s was likely
from high concentrations of plankton feeding pollock and sardine. In 1994, the biomass of euphausids
remained high and the biomass of copepods increased as the number of sagittas decreased.
These
changes were related to the beginning of the stabilization of the composition and structure of the
plankton community under new conditions.
The plankton community of West Kamchatka was quite different to other areas of the Okhotsk
Sea due to a pronounced reduction of the biomass of pollock, the most important plankton feeding fish.
In 1994, the number of predatory plankton in Kamchatka waters was maximum but the levels remained
high (Table 3). Such a high level of predatory plankton was abnormal in communities and was likely
the result of decreased predation. It was likely that the process of succession occurred as was found in
the southern part of Sea. New information about the Okhotsk Sea plankton also supported the
conclusion that the plankton community was in a transition but the reorganization occurred at different
rates in different areas.
NEKTON COMMUNITIES
In 1993, simultaneous to the decreased sardine and pollock biomass in the southern Okhotsk
Sea, there was an increase of squids abundance which was unexpected (Table 4). In 1994, the biomass
and abundance of the fish concentrations increased due to the increased number chum and pink salmon
which came into the Okhotsk Sea for part of the year. In the southern part of pelagic zone there was
no change in the number of some epipelagic fish after the pollack and sardine decreased.
It was
thought that herring from Sakhalin, anchovy, saury, arabesque, greeling and squids might have
replaced the pollock. At the present time, changes in abundance of fish species in the north Okhotsk
Sea is no longer synchronous (Table 5). In 1994, for the first time, more than one third of the fish
biomass in the epipelagic zone was herring.
DEMERSAL ICHTIYOCENOSIS
Most populations of demersal fishes and invertebrates which were reduced by fishing in the
1950s-1960s, began to recover due to better management measures in allocating the catch (Shuntov,
1985). In the early 1980s, when fish and crab stocks grew, the production of the benthos was
evidently under-exploited by fishes and invertebrates (Table 6). It was concluded that benthos stocks
would further increase (Dulepova and Borets, 1990). In the late 1980s, the biomass of demersal fish
264
and crab on the West Kamchatka shelf increased approximately two times (Dulepova and Borets, 1994).
As a consequence, the consumption of benthos organisms approached the value of production (trophic
capacity) if one considers that not all the benthos organisms were food for fish and crab. In this case
under moderate fishing, such a situation can, evidently, be indefinitely continued.
FISHING
By the early 1960, the total catch in the Okhotsk Sea reached approximately 1 min tons (Fig.
2). Herring, flatfish, salmon and crab were the most common species in the catch. In the second half
of the 1960s, the volume of the catch of salmon and flatfish decreased but the catch of herring and,
especially, pollock increased. The pollock became the most abundant of the species caught of all the
fish species taken together. After the 200 mile fishing zone was introduced the access of foreign fleets
to Russian waters was limited and the catch in the Okhotsk Sea decreased by approximately two times.
By the mid-1980s, the Russian fishery had increased and stocks increased as a consequence of raising
the natural reproduction efficiency as well as relaxation of the fishing pressure in the second half of the
1970s, the total catch in the Okhotsk Sea reached 2.6 min. t., almost the 1975 level. This increase was
related to the increased pollock catch and, to lesser degree, from other stocks which were, at the,time,
at a good level (salmon, cod, flatfish, crab).
In the early 1990s, fishery conditions worsened in most of areas of the Russian economic zone.
In the Okhosk Sea, the catch remained stable until 1993 when the level declined from a maximum of
2.5-2.6 min. tons to the present reduction of the catch by approximately 0.5 min. t which was largely
related to decreased pollock abundance. It is not inconceivable that the lost income from the pollock
fishery can not be replaced by other species such as herring, cod, flat fishes, safron cod, crab, capelin
and other species.
Total catch in the Okhotsk Sea could be maintained at about 2 min. t or somewhat
higher if an increase of the Gizhigin and Sakhalin herring stocks were to take place. The Okhotsk Sea
and adjacent waters will remain a major fishing area of Russia.
The research described in this publication was funded partly by Grant N N49300 from the
International Science Foundation and the Government of Russia.

Influence of some Abiotic Factors on Spatial Population Dynamics
of
the West Kamchatka Flounders (Pleuronectidae)
Yuri P. DIAKOV
Kamchatka Fisheries and Oceanography Research Institute Naberezhnaya
18 Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskii, 683002 Russia
Flounders, inhabiting the waters of West Kamchatka are currently the most important
commercial species. The total catch increased from 30 to 55 thousand tons in an unregulated fishery.
The commercial species of flounders, except halibut, are yellowfin sole, Alaska plaice, Sakhalin
flounder, longhead dab, flathead sole, starry flounder and rock sole.
Often inhabiting in the same
regions, these species form a complex group.
Various interspecific relationships and common
biological features are tipical for the group.
The dynamic characteristics of flounder populations (distribution, migrations) are explored by
many investigatiors (Moiseev, 1953; Polutov, 1958; Fadeev, 1971, 1987).
This study estimates the
influence of dynamic factors on fish distribution and migration on the annual cycle.
Two aspects of distribution of the above species are considered in the paper:
1. To define the influence of population density of each species on depth and temperature in
different seasons, and to recognize the influence of these factors on fish distribution.
2. To determine the degree of habit coincidence of flounder which will give the opportunity to
explore their interspecific competition. The results allow estimates of directed catch for certain
species and to develop methods to determine commercial aggregations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples were collected by a bottom trawl survey on the shelf of West Kamchatka in 1973-
1990. About 1,200 trawls samples were collected during the period. To ascertain population density,
fish catch per unit effort is transformed into a relative number.
The number is represented as the
percent of the total catch per effort in a certain month and a year. Later a corresponding average value
for each month for the years of the survey is estimated.
The information obtained was used to
characterize fish aggregation density in connection with three factors:
depth (interval - 20 metres),
temperature of water on the bottom (interval - 0.5°C) and latitude (interval - 15').
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The distribution of West Kamchatka flounder in the seasonal cycle is typical of the distribution
within limits of the depth and the temperature of water on the bottom. All flounder species examined
were mostly concentraded at depths of 90 to 250 metres in winter (January-February)
and in the
shallows from 20 to 160 metres in spring due to seasonal migrations from deep waters to shoal waters.
Quite different optimum temperature conditions for most of the West Kamchatka species are found
during three time periods: winter-spring (January-May), summer (June-July) and summer-autumn
(August-September). Four relatively stable periods of flounder distribution are found with various
272
combination of bathymetric and thermic conditions. These periods are as follows: winter (January-
February), spring (April-May), summer (June-July) and summer-autumn period (August-September).
Analysis of the data indicate that there are common and specific features of flounder
distribution for various species. Regular bathymetric distribution in different seasons is typical for
flatfishes examined, except for the deepwater and cold water species: Sakhalin flounder and flathead
sole. In winter, the flounders density decreases gradually with the depth. The nature of the
relationship resembles a normal distribution. The dependence of population density on depth changes
sharply in spring-summer, summer and summer-autumn periods. The most fish aggregations are
marked on the shallows and decrease gradually as the depth increases (Figs. 1 (1, 2, 4, 6, 7)).
Sakhalin flounder and flathead sole did not show variations of bathymetric distribution in various
seasons. Flathead sole population density change a bit but it is independent of the season and depth
(Figs. 1 (5)). Sakhalin flounder extend their range of depth in summer-autumn period which is typical
for the species(Figs. 1 (3)).
West Kamchatka flounders population density varies greatly in different seasons with the water
temperature on the bottom. In winter and in spring, all species form the most dense aggregations in 0
- + 1°C water temperature. In summer, when the water warms, flounders are found in a broader
thermic range and did not appear to prefer any particular temperature. Coldwater species, Sakhalin
flounder and flathead sole, however, prefer waters of -1 - +2°C (Fig. 2).
The distribution of most West Kamchatka flatfish is related to depth during spring migration.
In April-May the variation of flatfish density aggregations is closely related to the bathymetric
gradient. In winter as well as in summer and summer-autumn the depth affects flatfish distribution the
least. This is more typical for the three shallow species: longhead dab, yellowfin sole and Alaska
plaice, and less for deep water species: Sakhalin flounder and flathead sole. The dependence of
aggregation density on depth is not marked for Sakhalin flounder and flathead sole. Rock sole and
starry flounder did not aggregate with depth gradient in winter but are found to do so in summer.
The temperature influence on West Kamchatka flatfish population density for four species:
yellowfin sole, longhead dab, flathead sole and starry flounder is defined by the temperature layer on
the bottom in winter and during spring migration. The dependence of flatfish distribution on the
temperature for Alaska plaice, Sakhalin flounder and rock sole greatly increases during spring months
compared with the winter period. The influence of temperature on flatfish distribution decreases
sharply for the summer months as catches are similar throughout the temperature range. Thus, the
results indicate that West Kamchatka flatfish distribution is influenced by the variability of habitat
conditions observed. If the formation of flatfish concentrations is mainly dependent on water
temperature in the home range in winter and during spring migration, the role of depth increases
greatly as it defines fish distribution and the distance traveled.
During summer feeding the influence of the depth and water temperature, in particular,
decreases.
Probably fish distribution and behaviour is more related to the of food supply abundance
and distribution.
Cluster analysis is used to determine the degree of habit competition among the different
species during the year. Each row of fish population density distribution is compared separately to all
other rows, depending on the depth, water temperature and latitude. In order to obtain quantative
values for the degree of habit coincidence, methods developed by Zhivotovsky are used to analyze
morphometric characters. The pair-group method by Baily (1970) is used to determine the population
habit coincidence.
273
Based on the analysis of the data there are three flatfish ecological nitches relative to the habit
conditions using a hierarchic approach (Fig. 3). Shallow and warm water species occupy one nitche:
yellowfin sole, longhead dab, Alaska plaice and starry flounder. The yellowfin sole and longhead dab
which belong to the genus Limanda are closely ecologically related (Fig. 3 (1)).
The other nitche
includes the deep sea and cold water species: Sakhalin flounder and flathead sole (Fig. 3 (2)). And,
finally, the third group is represent by rock sole (Fig. 3 (3)).
Deep but limited aggregations of rock
sole are found on the southwest Kamchatka shelf. Rock sole is seldom found north to 53°N.
Assuming all flounder species occupy a specific ecological nitche, then indirect evidence of the
competition between them can be considered.
Likely strong competition occurs among species from
the same or close nitches than for species from desperate nitches.
The most adaptable species will
increase in this case oppressing the other ecologically similar species.
Yellowfin sole is the most
abundant flatfish in the first group (Fig. 3), and longhead dab which is ecologically
similar is not very
abundant. Alaska place and starry flounder are not abundant though they are more abundant than
longhead dab.
In the second group, Sakhalin flounder is abundant on the shelf while flathead sole abundance
is in deeper water. And finally, rock sole form a separate group of high abundance in the southwest
Kamchatka coast as evidenced from commercial exploitation.

(Theragra chalcogramma) from the Sea of Okhotsk using the
Burnt Otolith Method and Implications for Stock Assessment
and Management

ABSTRACT
In a previous study the first two authors examined age determination structures of walleye pollock,
7heragra chalcogramma, from five stocks in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. We found that the burnt otolith
section method consistently produced older age estimates. In this report we used this method to age walleye
pollock sampled from the Sea of Okhotsk, and compared these results with ages estimated for the same fish
using the otolith surface method. We also discuss how these estimates change our understanding of a
number of biological parameters used in stock assessment, and also discuss the ecological implications.
INTRODUCTION
Up until the early 1980s age determination methodology was considered routine and
accurate for
aging all fish in a population. Unfortunately, few of these methods were validated.
In 1983, the first two
authors published a study which reviewed the accuracy of methods used to provide fish ages for fisheries
stock assessment and management (Beamish and McFarlane 1983). The study was intended to emphasize
the complexity of producing accurate ages and to discuss the consequences to assessments and management
of relying on ages of uncertain accuracy. We found that in general fish were being underaged and that these
age estimates had a substantial impact on estimates of growth and mortality that strongly
influenced the
development of management strategies.
In 1989 McFarlane and Beamish (1990) examined a number of structures which had been used to
estimate the age of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma)
in the Northeast Pacific Ocean to determine,
on a stock basis, which structure produced the most consistent pattern of growth and
the most obvious
annuli. In 1990, we extended this study to walleye pollock in the Sea of Okhotsk. The purpose of this
report is to briefly review the results of our examination of age-determination structures from
pollock in the
Northeast Pacific Ocean, present the results of our examination of otolith surface and otolith cross-sections
(burnt otolith method) from pollock from the Sea of Okhotsk, and comment on the implications for stock
assessment and management of these stocks.
METHODS
A sample of 160 pollock was collected by trawl from the Sea of Okhotsk (off northeastern Sakhalin)
in July, 1990. Each fish was measured for fork length and sex was determined. Paired sagitta otoliths were
collected from each fish. Unfortunately, scales were not collected from these fish.
Ages were estimated
using both the surface and burnt cross section.
Criteria for annulus identification are presented in Chilton
278
and Beamish (1982). In general, an otolith surface can be aged by immersing the otolith in water on a black
background and examining it with a dissecting microscope using reflected light. Some otoliths have a
cloudy or chalky surface inhibiting the identification of the growth zones. These zones may be made slightly
more distinct by rapidly dipping the otolith in a weak solution of HCI (usually 20%) before placing it in the
water.
Otolith cross sections are aged by breaking the otolith dorso-ventrally through the nucleus and
burning one of the broken surfaces in an alcohol flame and painting the burnt surface with non-toxic mineral
oil to enhance the contrast between growth zones. The annulus was defined as the translucent zone or the
zone of slower growth that appeared as a dark zone under reflected light.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
McFarlane and Beamish (1990) indicated that the most appropriate structure or method or both for
age determination may vary among stocks. Pectoral fin-ray sections, otolith surfaces and burnt otolith
sections are all suitable structures for stocks consisting of mainly younger fish.
Annuli on scales from all areas appeared to be distinct. However, ages estimated from scales were
similar to ages determined from other structures only for the youngest fish. For most stocks, the burnt
otolith section consistently produced older age fish. For example, for pollock from the Aleutian area and the
international waters of the Bering Sea (Donut Hole), more annuli were identified on the burnt otolith section
(Figs. 1 & 2) than on other structures. All four methods produced different age compositions (Figs. 3a &
b), which resulted in different estimates of length at age, growth and mortality (McFarlane and Beamish
1990).
For the Sea of Okhotsk stock, a similar pattern was found. The burnt otolith sections consistently
produced older ages than ages estimated using the otolith surface method (Fig. 4) when older fish were
present in the sample. For example, when the fish is young (Figs. 4a & b), both methods produce the same
estimates, however as the fish ages, and growth of the fish is reduced, otolith growth occurs almost
exclusively on the ventral surface of the otolith (Figs. 4d, f & h) resulting in a thickening of the otolith.
In order to identify the annuli, the otolith must be sectioned (broken) and burnt. As with the other
stocks (McFarlane and Beamish 1990), the two methods produced different age compositions (Fig. 5) and
growth curves (Fig. 6).
We recognize that the age estimates for pollock have not been proven to be accurate. However, we
applied the same age determination criteria to the burnt sections of pollock as we applied to other species
such as rockfish and sablefish. The older ages for those species have been shown to be correct (Bennett et
al. 1982; Leaman and Nagtegaal 1987; McFarlane and Beamish 1995). In our study and in other studies
comparing otolith surface and section readings (reviewed in Beamish and McFarlane 1987) it was shown that
otolith burnt sections do produce older age estimates than otolith surface readings.
Accurate age estimates are important for determining a number of biological parameters used in our
assessment models. In particular, accurate age estimates are required to determine growth, mortality rates
and identify strong year classes. If this small sample is considered representative of Sea of Okhotsk pollock,
then the natural mortality estimate from this area is lower than determined using the otolith surface ages.
Ensuring accurate age determination is also important in identifying and measuring the strength of year
classes of the stock. Misidentification of strong year classes would lead to a misunderstanding of the
precesses which regulate a population, particularly the importance of environmental factors.
We would like to conclude this report with a few thoughts on the "ecological" consequences of
understanding the population dynamics of a population. For example, what is the effect of truncating the age
279
distribution of a population? What are the long-term implications.
If many individuals in the population
would actually live to 25 or 30 years in an unfished stock then there had to be an advantage to a population
having these old fish around ... clearly related to environment.
In an earlier paper we hypothesized that the length of life was related to the longest period of
unfavourable conditions that the species encountered. Just the fact that pollock can live this old means there
were such environmentally unfavourable periods. If this is true then our management strategies must
consider that at some point these environmental conditions leading to poor survival of pollock will reoccur.
If we truncate the age structure then we are becoming the agents of natural selection - and we are selecting
for fish that optimize their survival under heavy fishing pressure as opposed to natural selection which
selects for survival of the species in an environment that has extreme fluctuations in the physical or
biological conditions.
What happens to these "truncated" stocks when the extreme environmental changes occur.
Notice
we said when, not if. It is inevitable that these changes will occur. We believe that accurate ages of walleye
pollock will indicate that in general our management of fisheries must be conservative both because mortality
rates are lower (stocks less productive) and there needs to be enough fish to survive periods of poor
conditions.

Migration of Greenland Turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides)
in the Okhotsk Sea
Larisa P. NIKOLENKO
Pacific Research Fisheries Centre (TINRO-Centre), Vladivostok, Russia
The Sea of Okhotsk Greenland turbot annual catch has been 15-19 thousand tons since 1976.
The ecology of the species is not well understood, particular, the distribution of larvae and young up to
three years old and during the pelagic phase. This information would be useful to better manage the
fishery. This paper presents an analysis of ichthyoplankton survey data from surveys in 1984-1987,
pelagical surveys 1985-1993 and botton surveys 1963-1993.
The analysis showed that Greenland turbot with mature gonads (stages IV-V, V, V-VI)
occurred along the continental slope of western Kamchatka, northern Okhotsk Sea and northeastern
Sakhalin. The most intensive spawning occurred in TINRO basin, where catches were 10-25 per hour
trawled but some catches exceeded 50 (Fig. IA). The Lebed trough and Tinro basin are import for
commercial fishing which was confirmed by data collected by scientific observers on fishing vessels in
October-November, 1985. Almost all spawning was concentrated in these two areas (Fig. 1B). The
northeast Sakhalin slope is of secondary importance, where some catches reached 25 per hour trawled
but the majority of catches did not exceed 10. In other areas, spawning individuals were rare from 1
to 10 per hour.
Larvae of Greenland turbot from 17 to 24.2 mm were caught in the epipelagic zone.
The
larvae were distributed over the north of the Sea of Okhotsk and some specimens were collected near
the Kuril Islands (Fig. 2). High concentrations were found in the TINRO basin and near the
northeastern Sakhalin coast.
Twelve to 15 cm fingerlings were caught while trawling from 0-60 m above the 60 to 190 m
depth. There was a significant difference in the distribution of larvae and fingerlings.
Fingerlings
were found in Terpeniya Bay, Shelikhov Bay and adjacent waters as well as the nearshore of southwest
Kamchatka (Fig. 3). The highest catches of 7-8 cm (100 or more) specimens were in Shelikhov Bay
and adjacent shelf waters of northwest Kamchatka. In waters adjacent to southeast Sakhalin,
fingerlings were rare, less than 10 per trawl.
The distribution of larvae and fingerlings was related to the main currents of the Sea of
Okhotsk. Larvae from TINRO basin were carried by the current along the continental slope of
northwest Kamchatka (the north branch of the West Kamchatka current) to Shelikhov Bay (Markina
and Chernyavskyi, 1984). The origin of the Sakhalin fingerlings was probably from mixed eggs and
larvae carried by the middle current from the northern part of the Sea of Okhotsk to northeast Sakhalin
where they were picked up by the East Sakhalin current to join with local larvae in the South Bay of
Islands.
All areas in the Sea of Okhotsk, where larvae and fingerlings were found, were regions of high
biological productivity(Chernyavskyi et al., 1981; Markina and Chernyavskyi 1984;
Shuntov et. al
1993). Some drift to other areas also occurred as catches of larvae and fingerlings were obtained near
Kuril and Shantar Islands.
286
Greenland turbot yearlings were from 14-23 cm. At one year old they usually settled to the
bottom in the Bering Sea and on the shelf of East Kamchatka. In the Sea of Okhotsk, good catches of
18-20 cm Turbot were caught in a pelagic trawl at depths of from 64 to 210 m at the same location as
fingerling. Yearlings occurred in the pelagic zone of Shelikhov Bay where catches reach 25-50 per
hour trawled but were less than 25 near southeast Sakhalin (Fig. 4). Older specimens moved in an
anticlockwise direction in Shelikhov Bay and there was an appearance of some yearlings in Tauiskiy
Bay and adjacent waters.
Not more than 5 per hour trawled of 1 + individuals occurred along the shelf of the north part
of the Sea of Okhotsk and they were distributed over a broader area compared to the fingerlings. They
also occurred along the shelf of Tauiskiy and adjacent waters on shelf and upper continental slope of
TINRO basin and the northwest shore of Kamchatka.
In contrast to the northern areas, the number of fingerlings in the pelagic zone near Sakhalin
decreased significantly and the majority of 1 + settled to the bottom of Terpeniya Bay and adjacent
areas of the East Sakhalin shelf.
In general, the eggs and larvae drifted in the West Kamchatka Current toward Shelikhov Bay.
Probably the concentration of young fish near southern Sakhalin had the same origin. Eggs and the
larvae also drifted to the northeast Sakhalin coast in the Middle Current, and local larvae were carried
by the East Sakhalin Current into Southern Bay of Islands where they eventually settled to the bottom.
Kelp, coral and balanus prevent bottom trawl surveys in Shelikhov Bay. Nevertheless, judging
from the stable and dense concentrations of larvae and juveniles up to age 2 in the northeast area and in
pelagic zone of Shelikhov Bay it can be theorized that part of the Okhotsk Greenland turbot settle in
this Bay. The northeast area was favourable for development of the young because there are numerous
gyres and upwellings and it is a zone of high biological productivity during the larval drift period
along the northwest Kamchatka shore. A vast gyre in Shelikov Bay prevent juveniles from being
carried to less productive areas before they settle to the bottom. The northern shelf within the Sea of
Okhotsk provides good condition for a gradual transition of Greenland turbot from shallow to the deep
depth as they grow older.

Fisheries Impact on the Sakhalin-Hokkaido Herring Population

For several decades the Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring Clupea Pallasi
has attracted attention of
fishery scientists because of the commercial exploitation potential from the population where
annual
cumulative catch reached a high of 1 min t., a greater annual yield than any other Far-East population.
At the same time, other regional populations such as Sakhalin-Hokkaido declined.
Birman (1973)
indicated that an increase in the Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring abundance should have been expected
in
the 1970s but actually only the 1973 yearclass was good. Sokolovsky (1985) predicted stock
increases
during the 1980s but only the 1983 yearclass was good although it proved to be lower than the
1973
yearclass. Therefore in the 1970-80s the abundance of the Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring population
remained at extremely low levels.
Conservation measures such as, stopping fishing for spawning and
immature fish, introducing a commercial fish size limit and full closure of the fishery for a
five-year
period did not produce an increase in the stock. Thus, understanding the reasons causing the
declines
in abundance and ways to stabilize and increase abundance of the herring would help manage
the
fishery. In this paper, the author attempts to propose possible solutions by establishing reasons
for
regulating the herring fishery.
Data on the annual Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring catches for a period 1921-1992 together
with
information on the age composition, yearclass strength and stock levels are analyzed. The long
time
series of data allows a review of abundance fluctuations which indicates three abundance
related
periods in the Sakhalin-Hokkaido population as follows:
1. Before 1950 during a period of the high abundance year-classes varies from 201.5 bin in
1939
to 1.8 bin in 1949 with average 28.3 bin.
2.
1951-1960 a sharp abundance decline occurs (transitional stage) from 5.4 bin in 1953 to 0.3
bin in 1960 with average of 1.9 bin fish.
3. 1961-1992 the population remains in a depressed state. Yearclass strength varies from 4.7 bin
in 1973 to 0.05 bin in 1985 with average of 0.8 bin fish.
During 1949-1951, 1953-1956, 1958, 1961 several bin individuals were produced but lower
abundances occur in 1965, 1970; 1972-1973 (Fig. 1). In the years that followed only the 1983
yearclass is high (2.85 bin).
In the other years extremely low abundance levels (tens of millions
individuals) are observed.
The stock level declines from the early 1950s to the present is from fishing and poor
yearclass
production (Fig. 1). It is interesting to note that the occurrence of a few good year-classes did not
prevent the stock from continuing to decline. The stock has not shown any attempt to recover
and has
remained in a depressed state for a long time. For each of the three abundance-related periods, the
Sakhalin-Hokkaido population, mean stock abundance and catches are calculated for several age groups
as follows:
292
1. In the periods of high abundance, the exploitation rates of cohorts 3 to 9 years old constituted
5.35% for the age 3, 7.8% for the age 4, 9.6% for age 5, 10.9% for age 6, 11.2% for age 7,
16.2% for age 8 and 39.0% for age 9 (Fig. 2).
2. During the reduced abundance period, the exploitation rate of 3 years olds increases to 39.2%,
for 4, 5, 6 and 7s; 35.5%, 26.8%; 16.3 and 22.4% respectively. The exploitation rate of 8
and 9 year olds decreases to 14.7 and 13.7% respectively. The fishery appears to be
concentrating on fish 3-5 years old during maturation .
3. Exploitation rates during low stock abundance for 3 to 9 year olds is similar to that observed
during the decline; 34.3% for age 3, 39.7% for age 4, 44.2% for age 5, 23.1% for age 6,
6.0 % for age 7, 2.9 % for age 8 and 0.9 % for age 9.
During normal stock abundance levels, commercial catches are dominated by individuals of
older age (that might have participated in spawning at least 4 times) groups, while in periods of
abundance decline catches are dominated by immature and first maturing fish. While the stock was
depressed, the 1973 and 1983 year-classes are relatively high and the 1974 and 1980 are at low levels.
The first two year-classes are exploited at 75.7% for 1973 for the 3 year olds and 56% for 1983 (Fig.
3). Exploitation rate for 4, 5 and 6 year olds for both years are 51-52, 25-44.5, and 21.6-25.6%
respectively.
Catch during the low 1974 and 1980 stock abundance also tends to be concentrated on
young immature fish before they are able to breed. The stock has been harvested by both Japan and
Russia. During the last 16 years, the Russian catch varies between 0.7-4.3 th. t, while the Japanese
catch varies from 1.4 to 72.4 th. t (Fig. 4). The average annual exploitation rate is 14.5 and 85.5 %
respectively.
The Russian fishery focuses on feeding concentrations and the Japanese on over
wintering and pre-spawning fish. In the initial years of the fisheries, Japan caught much more than
Russia, especially of high abundance year-classes (Probatov, 1954). For example, a total catch for the
1983 brood year constituted 614 min individuals, with Japanese portion amounting to 92.2% or 559.8
individuals. The catch of the Japanese fleet in 1986 was 73% or 408.7 min of younger than 3 years
old (Fig. 5). In 1987 the Japanese fishermen took 83.7 min individuals of the same yearclass.
Therefore, about 88% of the total catch of the 1983 yearclass were taken by the Japanese fleet during
maturation period, which greatly reduces the reproductive potential of the parent stock (Fig. 5).
The lack of spawners on the Sakhalin-Hokkaido grounds has been discussed (Kachina, 1974,
1981; Pushnikova, 1981, 1994) including meetings of different levels and meetings between Russian
and Japan. Russian scientists proposed a closure of the fishery to allow the population to increase but
the proposal was not accepted by representatives from Japan. The eggs surveys conducted in 1970,
1980 and 1990s, reveal that 90% (and in some years even more) of the traditional Sakhalin-Hokkaido
population spawning grounds is not visited by spawners even though the substrate is ideal (good algae
and eel grass). No herring eggs were found in traditional areas where major spawning usually occurs.
Spawn was observed at smaller spawning sites that were difficult to find (Fridland, 1951).
Based on a study to determine an appropriate parent progeny ratio, it is estimated that an
optimum parental stock abundance for the population should be 3 bin individuals (Pushnikova, 1994).
The estimated spawning stock strength from 1968 to 1976 varies between 0.04 and 0.35 bin fish about
15 times lower than the optimum level for the stock. If the current fishing strategy is continued on
these stocks, the abundance will likely continue to drop. This is supported by the abundance decline,
poor yearclass strength and no spawning on traditional spawning grounds and extremely low spawner
abundance. To prevent this continuing decline the parent stocks should be stabilized and provide for
favorable conditions to allow the stock to increase, thus, a closure of the fishery for both Russia and
Japan should occur.

Is Pollock Overfished?
Vidar G. WESPESTAD
Alaska Fisheries Science Center
7600 Sandpoint Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115, U.S.A.
Is pollock overfished?, is a question often asked by fisheries and conservation groups. The
primary motivation has been the growth in the harvest by U.S. vessels, and the entry of large amounts
of pollock on the international market from the Far East. The appearance of Russian pollock in the
international market along with large catches from international waters in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas
has increased concern over the long term health of the pollock resources. Conservationist point to
pollock fisheries as a possible cause of declines in the abundance of sea lions and sea bird populations
for which pollock is an important food. The recent history of exploitation and stock declines and
collapses in North Atlantic cod populations has also caused conservation groups to question the
management and condition of pollock in the North Pacific.
Catch relative to exploitable biomass has been relatively low for the major North Pacific
pollock stocks.
Comparing the level of exploitation of eastern Bering Sea pollock to the major cod
stocks of the North Atlantic for the period 1964-1990, it can be seen that the level of exploitation was
about 20% for pollock, while Atlantic cod stocks were fished at a much higher level (Fig. 1). The
northeast Arctic cod of the Barents Sea was closed to fishing in the early 1990s and recovered due to
the fortuitous occurrence of a very strong year-class. The Northern cod of eastern Canada collapsed
recently following an extended period of over harvest and has caused economic hardship to the
Newfoundland fishing community. The North Sea cod is likely the next stock to collapse, since the
fishery now operates on age 2 fish, of which about 75% are harvested. Iceland is attempting to reduce
cod harvest this year and has made sharp reductions in cod quotas hoping that controls will prevent a
stock collapse similar to Canada and Norway.
Why compare walleye pollock to Atlantic cod? Primarily, because they are ecological
equivalents, being the dominant gadid species and having similar behaviors. Fig. 1 clearly shows that,
in gadids, that exploitation in excess of 50% is not sustainable. The question is what is the safe level
of fishing for pollock and other members of the cod family.
The abundance of pollock is controlled by recruitment variation. In the eastern Bering Sea the
largest year-class (18 billion fish at age 3) was 11 times greater than the weakest year-class, 1.6 billion
at age 3.
Eastern Bering Sea recruitment is best fitted to a Ricker spawner-recruit function, which is
logical for pollock because cannibalism by adult pollock is a major factor influencing recruitment (Fig.
2). Temperature is also important, and warm years usually produce strong year-classes and cold years,
weak ones. Variation in recruitment produces variation in stock biomass which can be quite strong in
pollock as shown in Fig. 3 for the eastern Bering Sea and other stocks. What is interesting is the
similarities
between the Okhotsk Sea and eastern Bering Sea. In both the 1978 year-class was strong
and more recently the 1989. The apparent similarity of biomass trends between the two areas suggests
the influence of broad scale climatic factors. Perhaps further study of this phenomenon will produce
some insight in underlying causes of recruitment variation. Since 1977, pollock harvest in the eastern
Bering Sea has been kept to under 1.5 million t including discarded catch. Can this harvest be
sustained?
299
To examine the question, I have been modeling the population dynamics of the stock along
with different fishing patterns. The primary variable is recruitment. I incorporated recruitment in the
model as a Ricker model with log normal error to reflect the natural variation observed in the history
of the stock. One result of the model with fishing at the F0.1 level, which is the F that results in a yield
per recruit that is 10% that obtained from the first increment of fishing effort, shows the recruitment
trend is similar to the trend observed (Fig. 4). The important point is that fishing at the F0,1 level
produces catches on average that are greater than recent year averages, and the biomass does not fall
below 4 million t--the lowest level observed in the stock (Fig. 4 lower panel). Fishing at F0.1 equals an
F of 0.31, an exploitation of around 20%. The maximum level of harvest is at F=0.43 which 28%
exploitation. Fishing at levels beyond a 28% exploitation rate results in overfishing and reduced long-
term yield.
The long-term yield from the fishery is greater than currently taken and the biomass is near the
long-term average. My conclusion is that eastern Bering Sea pollock is not overfished and catches
near the current level can be sustained without any problem. Model results indicate that any
exploitation below 28% does not impact the productivity of the pollock resource. Similar results have
been obtained for Northeast Arctic cod, which suggests a 30% exploitation rate may be a maximal
exploitation rate for gadids. The best exploitation policy for eastern Bering Sea pollock may be to fix
catch in the range 1.3-1.5 million t for economic reasons, and not allow the fishery to grow beyond
this level, thus avoiding having to reduce quotas at times of stock decreases, which given the recent
crises in the Atlantic cod stocks, are apparently difficult to do.

Epipelagic Far Eastern Sardine of the Okhotsk Sea
Vladimir A. BELYAEV, Alexander Yu. ZHIGALIN
TINRO, Vladivostok
The far eastern sardine was one of the most abundant species in northwest Pacific in the 1970-
1980 period. The distribution and migration patterns changed from earlier times (Kenya, 1981).
The maximum abundance of sardine during the feeding period (summer-autumn) migrates into
the south part of the Okhotsk Sea from the Pacific following the warm waters from the Japan Sea and
Soya Current. During the high sardine abundance levels, the Russian fishing fleet concentrated their
effort on catching the species. Landings first occurred in 1977, however, the most successful fisheries
were after 1984. The fishery usually occurs from June to October as was observed in 1988 when a
maximum catch of 241,300 ton occurred (Fig. 1).
There are two main regions where sardines are caught in the Okhotsk Sea, near the Okhotsk
Sea coast of the Kuril Islands and in the southern Okhotsk Sea near Sakhalin (Fig. 1).
The sardine
distribution in these two regions are usually distinct but in October 1985 they were continuous (Fig.
l.ii). Catches in the Okhotsk Sea are thought to have come from two different populations. A Pacific
population that came through Kuril Straits to feed adjacent to the Kuril Islands, and a population from
the Japan Sea entering into the Okhotsk Sea through Laperuza Strait, near Sakhalin. Sardines which
fed near Sakhalin are from the Japan Sea population (Shvidkiy and Levada, 1987). Surveys indicate
that the catch near the Kuril Islands was fish from the Pacific population near Sakhalin, a significant
part of catch was from the Japan Sea population. The annual biomass was calculated for Sardines
distributed near to Hokkaido, southern Kuril Islands (Pacific part) and in the Okhotsk Sea. Based on
these estimates we assume that, in the summer-autumn period, up to 25% of the Pacific population
migrates into the Okhotsk Sea.
The biomass of the Pacific sardine population during maximum abundance is estimated to be
about 30 million tons which is comparable to the biomass of walleye pollock in the Northwest Pacific.
The sardine biomass in the Okhotsk Sea is calculated based on data that include the month,
catch, catch per boat day and catch per effort (on one seine net haul). The analysis is standardized
based on methods used by the Laboratory of Fish Resources from Kuroshio (Abakumov, 1993). The
sardine biomass is estimated from 1985 to 1991. There is insufficient data for the earlier period since
1977. Biomass in the area of the fishery increases from 320 thousand tons to 1,200 thousand tons
(Fig. 2). The total biomass is 3-4 millions tons as the fishery covered only small part of the
distribution (Fig. 3). These data appear to indicate that sardine is the dominate species in the southern
part of the Okhotsk Sea.
The total size of the sardine population has an influence on the epipelagic ecosystem of the
Okhotsk Sea. It is one of the rare species that feeds on phytoplankton in this area (Kun, 1975).
Sardine consume some zooplankton but the greatest portion of their diet consists of phytoplankton
(Table 1). An estimate the quantity of food consumed by the sardine from data from the middle 1980's
is used as an estimate of the biomass from the earlier period is poor. The food eaten during the day
changes from 4 to 6% in the Japanese Sea, southern Kuril Islands and Hokkaido regions.
Unfortunately, data on the ration of the sardine from the Okhotsk Sea is not available. The necessary
304
food required during maximum abundance of the sardine is estimated to be about 8 million tons (Fig.
2).
If the real biomass of the sardine is three times higher the volume of food consumed, it would be
16-24 million tons.
The efficiency of food utilization by sardines from the southern part of the Okhotsk Sea is
evaluated by Dulepova (1991) who found that the sardine has a significant influence on abundance and
biomass of phyto- and zooplankton.
The existence of competition for food between sardine and other species s evaluated. For
example, the food similarity between sardine and walleye pollock is from 20 to 30% overlap in various
regions. Highest overlap is in the southern Kuril Islands (juvenile walleye pollock and adult sardine).
It should be noted that there is an independent population of the walleye pollock in the southern part of
the Okhotsk Sea called the Sakhalin-Hokkaido population. Most years competition for food resources
between sardine and walleye pollock is relatively small except during the high abundance of the sardine
in a middle of the 1980's.
It should also be noted that the catch of walleye pollock in this region has
decreased in comparison with the 1970's.
The increase of the populations of sardine in the 1980's in comparison with the end of 1970's
is more than 500-1,000 times. At the same time the vital space of the walleye pollock in the southern
part of the Okhotsk Sea is reduced.
CONCLUSION
During high abundance, the far eastern sardine population expands into the coldwater
ecosystem of the Okhotsk Sea. At the same time, the increase in abundance creates an intensive
fishery which is comparable to the dominant species of the coldwater complex (for example, walleye
pollock). The influence of the sardine on the ecosystem of the Okhotsk Sea is found to be as follows:
1.
the sardine consumes a great amount of zoo and phytoplankton which impacts on their
abundance;
2.
the sardine competes for food resources with other fish in the summer-autumn period;
3. the sardine serves as food for predatory fish, bird and marine mammals;
4.
the abundance of the sardine is so great that it occupies a large part of the southern Okhotsk
Sea;
5.
other subtropical fishes (saury, anchovy, the common mackerel) also influence the ecosystem
of the Okhotsk Sea in summer-autumn.

Developing a new stock exploitation plan for a horsehair crab fishery in the South Kuril Strait
is difficult without having knowledge about the abundance and productive capacity including
measurements of the population structure, growth rates and longevity.
In this paper analysis of data by crab groups to present some productive characteristics of
horsehair crab stock state using catch effort and size structure is attempted.
THE MATERIAL AND METHODS
Samples were collected using a standard truncated cone shape trap, with bottom ring diameter
of 103 cm, upper ring diameter of 54 cm, height of 50 cm and mesh size of 60 mm, set in the central
part of the strait between Kunashir and Shikotan Islands at depths of 52-78 in.
Fresh-frozen pollock
was used as bait in traps that were fished for one to two days. Vernier calipers
(precision of ±0.1 mm)
were used to measure the largest width (W) and length (1) of the carpace.
Stock age structure is
determined by the size of animals using probability paper (Harding, 1949) and known size-age from
North Hokkaido horsehair crab (Abe, 1977, 1982, 1984 - cit. by Abe, 1992). Histograms indicate that
the size step is 1 mm. Group growth is calculated using Bertalanffy equations because of the good
correspondence between the modal values of W at age of t years.
Samples were collected from July-September. Ten samples of individuals of different sexes
were collected before and after molting. Samples NN 1, 5, 8, 10 were gathered
in 1991, NN 2, 3, 4,
6, 7, 9 in 1994. The number of crabs caught in the samples were 3060, 3063, 888, 1169, 3012, 1148,
1265, 903, 1781 and 652, respectively.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In July, 85-87% of the individuals had soft or semi-hard carpace due to molting and by the end
of September 30% had a hard carpace. Most of the catches (82-92%) consist of males with carapace
width of 35-122 mm and 50-70% were commercial size (W > 80 mm).
The average weights of
individuals was 490-520 g. Females size varied between 41-102 mm. Moulting is complete by the end
of August when 50% of the individuals are fertilized and their reproductive orifice are sealed
indicating the success of mating.
312
The average catch effort (y) in all groups (commercial males, commercial males and females)
increases
up to the second week of August to 3.07 individuals, for large males at a depth of
approximately 70 in, then decreases rapidly. Values y of commercial groups are 1.49, 1.36, 0.8 and
1.08 individuals in 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994, respectively indicating a stock decrease during the
period.
Unfortunately, this conclusion cannot be confirmed because correct official statistics are not
available.
At the same time, a horsehair crab stock decrease was observed in the neighboring area
along the north coastal of Hokkaido, where catches dropped from the beginning of the 60s to 2-3
thousands tons (Abe, 1992).
Bearing in mind postmoulting growth of body size, the estimate of the modal values W for
individuals of each sex and physiological state were the same in different samples so they are combined
to calculate the corresponding average values (Table 1). The horsehair crab reproduction period is
lengthy (Abe,1992), and settling was found to be polymodal (Fig.1) which makes comparison of the
age modes difficult.
Thus, Abe's size-age method is used: males and females up to the second year
moult grow similar;
at the sixth instar (one year) the average carapace length is 20.4 mm; at the ninth
instar (two years) 46.4 mm; male growth increases reaching 59.1, 73.3, 88.2, 103.5, 117.5 mm, at age
3, 4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10 years at instars NN 10-14; female growth is 55.9, 65.8, 74.1 mm at age 3-5, 6-8,
9-11, 12-14 years at instars NN 10-13, respectively.
We calculate the theoretical relationship to
determine lengths in widths:
for males:
if1 < 75 mm, W=0.931,
if I > 75 mm, W =0.8861 + 3.465 (original data),
for females: W =0.951 - 0.1 (Kawakami, 1934 - cit. by Abe, 1992).
It appears, that male carapace widths are 19, 43.1, 55, 68.4, 81.6, 95.1, 107.6 mm at age 1, 2,
3, 4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10 years, and female are 19.3, 44, 51.6, 62.4, 70.3, 79.7 mm at age 1, 2, 3-5, 6-8,
9-11, 12-14 years, respectively.
The following measure of average values of modes: 54.5, 68.8,
81.4, 95.2, 107.4 mm and 51.7, 63.4, 70.2, 81.2 closely correspond to the theoretical figures (Table
1). On the bases of these modes the curves of linear growth were constructed (Fig. 2). Up to the age
of 3 years females grow very fast and then by about 50 mm width their growth rate slows significantly,
which corresponds to the beginning of first maturity (Abe, 1992).
The equations of horsehair crab linear growth are as follows:
Wt =135. (1-
e-0.1823t)
for males,
Wt =112.23 - 60.5
e-0.2087{'r-1.333
for females aged 4 or more years,
where:
W, - carapace width at age t (years);
135, 112.23 - definitive width sizes (W.), mm;
0.1823 year' and 0.2087 year' - constants of growth;
t - conventional age equal to t/3;
1.333 - conventional zero age for to = 4 years;
60.5 = W. - W., where W. =51.7 mm.
The following theoretical values correspond to given equations: for males at age 1, 2, 3 ... 9
years, sizes are 22.5, 41.2, 56.9, 69.9, 80.7, 89.8 (conventionally), 97.3, 103.6 (conventionally),
108.8 mm; for females at age 4, 7, 10, 13, 16 years, 51.7, 63.1, 72.3, 79.9, 86 mm respectively.
313
Approximation correctness is estimated in the Fig. 2 from calculated sizes. Thus, the biggest horsehair
crab male found is 152 mm length and for females 117 mm (Abe, 1992) which corresponds to
approximately 138 and 111 mm width.
The average maximal theoretical crab age ( W. = 0.95 WW ), was 16.4 year for males and
about 37 years (!) for females. Such great longevity is theoretically due to the low rates of female
growth. The real figures are likely lower due of strong fishing press.
The characteristics of growth for horsehair crab in the South Kuril Strait is identical to the
populations off the coast of North Hokkaido; growth rates of mature females are very low which
theoretically indicates greater longevity; for the last 4 years the catches decreases for the level of effort
observed which could indicate that the stocks are over harvested.

Mezoplankton Distribution in the West Japan Sea
Natalia T. DOLGANOVA
Pacific Research Fisheries Centre (TINRO-Centre)
4, Shevchenko Alley, Vladivostok, 690600, Russia
Species composition and biomass distribution of mezoplankton in the western Japan Sea from
0-100 m are evaluated from data obtained from two surveys during April-May in 1989 and 1990.
Samples were collected using a Jady plankton net (mouth square 0.1 sq. m., mesh size 0.168 mm,
rising velocity 0.5 m/s). Phytoplankton biomass is estimated from the net samples.
Zooplankton is
divided into three size fractions and fishing efficiency is used to calculate their biomass
("Recommendations", 1984; Volkov, 1986). The distribution of plankton is considered in four
specific water mass regions which had been defined by temperature salinity analysis:
Primorye Current zone,
subarctic zone,
Polar front between region II and IV zone(Fig. 1),
subtropic zone.
A phytoplankton "bloom" of 50 to 500 mg/cub.m occurred in April from southwest to
northeast. The species of genera Coscinodiscus, Chaetoceros, Thallasiosira, Ceratium are dominant.
The "bloom" ended in late May when the biomass decreases to 50 mg/cub.m.
Patches of high
phytoplankton biomass (200-500 mg/cub.m) occur in the Primorye Current zone and in an area known
for it's high productivity (Kun, 1984; Markina and Cherniavsky, 1985) (Fig. 2).
In spring plankton
accumulates in the upper 0-100 m layer (Zenkevich, 1963; Vinogradov, 1968). Zooplankton in Japan
Sea is characterized by the highest biomass in spring (Kun, 1975; Markina and Cherniavsky, 1985;
Volkov, Chuchukalo 1986; Lapshina et.al., 1990). The mean total biomass of zooplankton is about
1,000 mg/cub.m in April-May of both years. The total stock of plankton in the upper 100-m layer is
estimated as 120 t/sq. km in 1989 and 140 t/sq. km in 1990. The ratio between size fractions
in 1989-
1990 is equal though the total biomass in 1990 is higher. The high numbers of the small zooplankton
fraction (1.5 mm organisms were 100-360 mg/cub.m or almost 40% of total biomass) testifies to the
reproductive success. The middle fraction biomass is formed by large numbers (Figs. 3 and 4).
A boreal complex was found to be present in the mezoplankton. This complex is composed of
Parasagitta elegans, Neocalanus plumchrus, Neocalanus cristatus, Eucalanus bungii, Metridia
pacifica, Oithona similis, Oncaea borealis, Pseudocalanus minutus, 7hysanoessa longipes, Euphausia
pacifica and others. Some are homogeneously distributed, while others are concentrated creating a
large biomass in certain regions (Figs. 5 and 6). Copepoda
dominated in all the sampled areas. N.
plumchrus and M. pacifica constitute the maximal biomass but O. similis and P. minutus are the most
numerous. All stages of maturity of these animals are present but the young are the most abundant.
The biomass of certain groups of zooplankton dominate in each of the four regions: Copepoda
are the most abundant (84%) in the subarctic zone; followed by Amphipoda and Chaetognatha (each
about 20%) in region II; Euphausiacea (Thysanoessa longipes) and Chaetognatha dominate in the
Polar front, and they are observed to be the most significant species because of the faunae mixture;
Chaetognatha and Euphausia pacifica dominate in the subtropic zone. The ratio of the main groups of
318
zooplankton and size at maturity correspond to the rate of plankton community succession in a
particular water mass.
The day night cycle led to a change in the ratio of size fractions and the abundance of some
groups (Table 1). There are such active migrants such as Euphausia, Amphipoda and Chaetognatha.
Diurnal migration coefficients are 3.0-10.0. They are specifically for Copepoda: Metridia
pacifica 3.0 (adults) and 1.5 (copepodites III-IV); N. cristatus 5.0, Pareuchaetajaponica 6.0, Gaidius
variabilis 8.0. Small Copepoda, O. similis, P. minutus, O. borealis concentrations did not change
considerably throughout the maturity stages during the day/night cycle.

The salmon form aggregations composed of numerous stocks during their marine portion of
life.
Identification of these stocks in mixtures has been a great problem in salmon management for
fisheries agencies. The absence of the information on the stock composition results in either
overharvest or over escapement.
One of the most informative methods for investigating stock structure is the electrophoretic
analysis of protein variation. The method and its application began with developmental work by Utter
and his associates at the National Marine Fisheries Service in the 1970's. This method has been used
by several fisheries agencies in North America since the early 1980's and past results show that genetic
stock identification (GSI) is a practical fisheries management tool (Grant et al., 1980; Milner et al.,
1985; Utter et al., 1987; Shaklee et al., 1990; Wilmot et al., 1992).
Unfortunately, to date GSI analysis was almost never used for management purposes in Russia.
Recently, the genetic baselines were constructed for Asian pink and chum salmon. These baselines
cover main spawning regions of pink and chum in Asia ranging from Hokkaido to Anadyr river. Two
goals of this work were:
1.
to evaluate the accuracy and precision of stock composition estimates using computer simulations
of baselines,
2.
to estimate the stock-group contributions of the mixed fishery samples from the Sea of Okhotsk and
the North Pacific Ocean via maximum likelihood method.
MATERIAL AND METHOD
Chum and even year pink salmon baselines (Auke Bay Laboratory NMFS) were used for
computer simulations. Chum salmon baseline includes allozyme data for 30 loci and 33 stocks; even
year pink salmon baseline - 24 loci and 21 stocks (Fig. 1 and Table 1). We attemped to obtain 100
adults whenever possible from each stock. Six hundred and twenty six pinks were collected in the Sea
of Okhotsk and the North Pacific Ocean in 1994 during June-August by scientific vessels (Fig. 1).
Four tissues (muscle, liver, heart and eye) were taken from each fish for protein
electrophoresis.
Protein electrophoresis was conducted as described by Aebersold et at. (1987).
Specific enzymes were stained according to Harris and Hopkinson (1976) and Aebersold et al. (1987).
Estimation of the mixture composition and a simulation of possible mixture scenarious for a
given baselines were performed using the SPAM program (Gates, 1995).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Simulated mixtures were used to evaluate the accuracy (bias) and precision (standard deviation)
of the stock composition estimates. These hypothetical mixtures were generated using the baseline
allele frequencies assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. First, we used a simulated mixture of 100%
of the group and these simulations showed at least 87% accuracy for chum salmon and 83% for pink
salmon (Tables 2 and 3). We also used mixtures where the contributions of each baselines stock-group
to the simulated fishery mixture represented the stock compositions of likely mixed-stock fisheries.
These simulations were performed to explore the effects of sample size on the accuracy and precision
of the maximum likelihood estimates too. Our simulations revealed that chum and even year pink
baselines can provide a reasonable estimates of regional contributions.
The increase in sample size
reduced the bias and standard deviations of the estimates (Tables 4 and 5).
Maximum likelihood were calculated for the samples collected from the Sea of Okhotsk and the
North Pacific Ocean. The West Kamchatka region was the predominant group in all the estimates;
its
contribution ranged from 46% in the south part of the Sea of Okhotsk to 93% by the North Kuril
Islands (Fig. 1 and Table 6).
The alaskan component was also fairly consistent in the Sea of Okhotsk near West Kamchatka
ranging from 13% in the end of July up to 28% in the begining of August. These data contradict with
tagging information (Takagi et al., 1981) and are needed to verify, but simulation showed that alaskan
pinks can be identified with high accuracy and precision (Tables 2-5).
Computer simulations and mixed fishery analyses show the potentiality to use chum and pink
salmon baselines for both management and studies of the marine migration. Our permanent challenge
is to improve baselines, incorporating a new important stocks.

Strategy for Culture, Breeding and Numerous Dynamics of
Sakhalin Salmon Populations

ABSTRACT
The marine littoral zone and the influence of hatchery produced salmon fry on the biocenose
structure in South Sakhalin were studied. The littoral area is highly productive and had a complex
community structure. The release of hatchery salmon fry influences a number of the components of
littoral biocenose, particularly, the Harpacticoida which are the preferred food items of salmon fry
upon entering the sea. In shallow waters, the competition for food by chum and pink salmon fry
causes a deterioration of the habitat conditions for other species of fish, namely, pond smelt
(Hypomesus olidus), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes personatus) and the fry of plaice and Far-Eastern
navaga etc. Salmon fry are also feed for carnivorous fishes such as kunscha (Salvelinus leucomaenis),
rainbow Asiatic smelt and sculpins (Cottidae) etc and they compete for food with wild salmon fry
which lead to increased mortality of the naturally bred fry.
INTRODUCTION
For ten years, the Chairman of Water Ecology and Sea Culture of Far-Eastern State University
studied the conditions of salmon fry in regions influenced by hatchery production in the southwestern
and eastern Sakhalin waters. There is an enormous shallows which is separated from the open sea by a
stone ridge along the southwestern coast of Sakhalin. The warming and active aeration of waters in
the area creates an intensive growth of aquatic vegetation producing favorable conditions for the
reproduction of small invertebrates. Historically, a number of fish species inhabit the shallows and
more recently young hatchery salmon have been introduced to feed as they move into the sea. The
Department of Aquatic Ecology and Aquaculture has carried out research on wild communities and the
impact of hatchery produced salmon on the coastal areas (Andreyeva et al., 1994).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The investigations were carried out in different areas of southern Sakhalin from 1985 to 1991.
Samples of plankton, benthos, epiphyton, and fish were collected during May-July, during 3-5 day
periods. At the same time, 2 hr. diurnal observations were carried out in laboratory conditions. The
temperature, salinity, oxygen content, water level, direction and strength of wind were measured.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The salmon young feed on small invertebrates dwelling, in the water layers, on the vegetation
and on the bottom surface layer. The community composition can be classified as plankton, benthos,
and epiphyton as well as intermediate forms (planktobenthos). The most abundant groups in the study
area are Harpacticoida andAmphipoda.
332
The data indicate that seasonal and interannual abundance changes occur for most animal
groups but especially for Harpacticoida which are about 80-90% of the total biomass of plankton,
epiphyton and meiobenthos. A maximum biomass of Harpacticoida (760 sp.m 3) occurs in mid-May
which then decreases and is replaced by other species (Fig. 1). Abundant spring species are also
replaced by less abundant summer forms due to warm water formation (Fig. 2). Undoubtedly, the
abundance of Harpacticoida depends on the amount eaten by the salmon young which are in high
abundance at the end of May.
The plankton abundance (Pseudocalanus minutus,Acartia clausi, Centropages abdominales,
Oithona similis, some larvae of Polyhaeta) is maximum during the flood tide except for Eurytemora
thompsoni which increases during the falling tide. Daily rhythms were observed for other animals
such as Amphipoda, Harpacticoida, Isopoda, Ostracoda, Mysidacea, however, the increased
abundance in the water usually occurs during the night (Fig. 3). Diurnal fluctuations of abundance of
these groups can be explained by changes in their activity during the day. According to some authors,
the numbers and biomass of animals living in the bottom surface layer and on the vegetation increases
in the water column at night (D'Amours, 1988; Walters, 1988). During this study, diurnal migrations
vary among the different species but the number and biomass of Harpacticoida increases during the
day. Animals with a pronounced daily migration into the water column are found to be more
vulnerable to feeding young salmon and other fish. Young salmon mainly feed on Harpacticoida,
Amphipoda and less often of Polychaeta and Insecta larvae. Daily changes in feeding intensity and
food composition is typical for salmon young.
The food of the salmon young in the coastal marine areas consists of 14 groups of organisms,
usually the size preference was a length of 0.5-2.5 mm. The food spectrum depends on the habitat
type. In bays Amphipoda and Harpacticoida are 34.6 and 36.6% of the diet and in lagoons it is
mainly Polychaeta, Harpacticoida, and Amphipoda to lesser extent. The food composition changes in
May to large species of Harpacticoida, Harpacticus uniremus and species of Thalestris and
Dactylopodia, whose size are 0.8 - 1.5 mm. In June smaller species are eaten such as Tusbe and
Scutellidium which are 0.4-0.7 mm. The salmon young consume the maximum food at 1,200 in May
and 1,400 in June. During the daily cycle Harpacticoida is the dominant species in May, Amphipoda
and Insecta in June. The abundance of salmon fry had an influence on the abundance of the main
components of the littoral biocenose, particularly, Harpacticoida due to heavy predation when leaving
the river for the sea.
The salmon young near southwestern Sakhalin feed from the beginning of May to end of July.
They are competitors with other of coastal fishes: silver smelt, sand lance, burnstickle as well as the
young of Pacific navaga, flounders and other fish. Salmon fry are also food for carnivorous fishes of
biocenose: kundscha (Salvelinus leucomaenis), rainbow Asiatic smelt, sculpins (Cottidae) etc. The
salmon fry produced by hatcheries are competitors for food used by wild salmon fry which could lead
to an increase in mortality of naturally spawned salmon fry (in rivers).
During feeding in the coastal marine areas (a month and a half on average), the young salmon
consume up to 135 tons of food organisms daily which is estimated to be 30 mg day-1 per individual
and approximately 80-100 million individuals aree released from the hatcheries of southwestern
Sakhalin. The impact of hatchery salmon production changes food organism abundance and species,
such as for Harpacticoida, Amphipoda, Polychaeta and others, during there migration to the sea. Food
availability for a number of fish (smelt, flounder, sand lance, navaga and others) is also effected by the
large hatchery production. From studies of the daily ration of fry and estimates of the optimal
production of fry in this region about 3.5-11.5 million of fry would be optimum for the available
littoral area of Kalinin.
333
The analysis of data show that the total production of Sakhalin hatcheries did not contribute to
the low survival of fry and low recurrence of salmons. Rather the practice of releasing 20-30 million
fry at one time from hatcheries impacts on survival. A better policy would be to release 2-4 million
from the end of April to first part of May, 6-9 million from the middle of May and then reduce the
output throughout June until the total production has been released.
Additionally, it would be good
practice organize the release by spreading it along the Sakhalin seashore.

Primary Production in Sakhalin Shelf Waters

INTRODUCTION
The distribution and productivity of phytoplankton on the Sakhalin shelf varies in space and
time depending on different physical forcing. The dominant physical effects on phytoplankton
processes in this region are the strong seasonal changes in intensity of incoming solar radiation, wind
direction and nutrients in the water.
This work examines primary production on petroleum deposits on the continental Sakhalin
shelf at Chayvo, Arkutun-Dagi, Piltun and Sakhalin Bay. Development in these areas has started and
the measurement of primary production can be used as an indication of the effects of chronic
petroleum pollution and navigation on bioproductivity.
Productivity data were primarily collected from 27 stations located between 52° and 54° N and
142° and 144°E in depths not exceeding 90 in relative to the shelf waters.
METHODS
With some modifications, the primary production is measured according to Steeman Nielsen
(1952). Photosynthesis is calculated by the incorporation of C" in particles collected on 0.4 mkm
Synpor filters. All samples are processed in 0.1 NHCI and analyzed with the help of the Delta-100
liquid scintillation counter. The fixing of carbon during the dark is determined in each experiment.
The water is selected from different layers and incubated on the deck with neutral density filters to
simulate the in situ radiation field. The fractional exposition of the same water samples are used to
determine the daily production. In a special experiment C14 incorporation is very low at night
compared to the usual radioactive background.
The curve of daily production of 1 m3 of water is plotted on data of fractional expositions (by
calculation of under peak square) to determine the daily production in the water column under 1 m2.
The coefficients for each daylight period are calculated to permit exposition at any time.
The Phytoplankton Primary Production on Petroleum Deposits of Continental Sakhalin Shelf
Two major natural parameters regulating the phytoplankton quantity and production in the
ocean are light and nutrients, particularly, nitrogen. In the investigated region seasonal changes of
solar radiation on the sea surface and nitrate concentrations are significant. The Sakhalin Bay nitrate
concentration is very low, average 6 mM despite the Amur river discharge, much lower than in the
open Okhotsk sea 15 mM, and Piltun deposit 18 mM (Tech. Report, 1992). The primary production
is 0.33 gC/m2 day, 0.8 gC/m2 day and 2.4 gC/m2 day respectively. The nitrate concentration is taken
into account from the lower level of the photosynthesis zone to a depth not exceeding 50 m, since in
the upper layers the concentrations are grazed and it would underestimate the initial conditions. In
337
August 1992 on the Piltun deposit the average value of primary production reaches 2.4 gC/m2 day
(maximum 5.56 gC/m2 day ), and in August 1993 it did not exceed 0.53 gC/m2 day (Tech. Report,
1993). The comparison of primary production and nitrate concentration on stations with close
coordinates indicate that nitrate contents are some times higher (Table 1). The 1994 primary
production at the end of October during a shorter daylight period is compared to the longer daylight
period of August 1993. The values of primary production varies from site to site: Chayvo the
average primary production is 0.4 gC/m2 day (maximum 0.65 gC/m2 day); Arkutun-Dagi 1.24 gC/m2
day (maximum 2.84 gC/m2 day); Piltun 0.68 gC/m2 day (maximum 1.4 gC/m2 day) and in Sakhalin
Bay 0.42 gC/m2 day (maximum 1.21 gC/m2day) (Fig. 1). The length of daylight is the major
regulating parameter in the rate of phytoplankton production which explains the lower rate of
photosynthesis on the Piltun stations, for example, 0.68 gC/m2 day in October 1994 and 3.11 gC/m2
day August 1992. Additionally, the role of the nutrient flux in the Okhotsk Sea euphotic zone should
be taken into account as is shown in the nitrate example.
It is difficult to separate the different influences of these processes in determining primary
production because they are closely related. Some regeneration of nitrogen in the eutrophic waters is
caused by zooplankton and microzooplankton metabolism. The greatest phytoplankton biomass and
rate of primary production is from the nitrate flux from upwelling (Eppley and Peterson, 1979;
Dortch and Postel, 1989). While photosynthetic radiation defines the rate of primary production in
situ, the rate of dissolved nitrogen production is responsible for high primary production in the
upwelling zone. As a rule, a combination of the solar radiation and nitrate flux provides higher levels
of primary production in summer.
The arrangement of the deposits and the distribution of primary production is shown in Fig. 1.
The lowest primary production is observed on Chayvo, the highest on Arcutun-Dagi, and on other two
sites the values are similar and intermediate. The change of the primary production on Chayvo is
possibly connected to sampling conditions (the stormy weather causes the top and bottom water layers
to mix in the shallow depths) as is evident from the vertical distribution of primary production in
different layers. The maximum primary production which usually occurs near surface or just below
does not occur at nearly all the stations. A similar distribution is observed on the very shallow
Sakhalin Bay (maximal depth 22 m) deposit. The value of primary production is reasonably high 1.21
gC/m2 day. The deposit is near the Amur river influence and the water structure is characterized by
the upper quasi-homogenous layer to 10-15 m. It is reflected in the homogeneous vertical primary
production structure. The lowest daily production, which did not exceed 0.2 gC/m2 day, is observed
in strong current. Thus the non-uniformity in primary production (from 1.21 to 0.15 gC/m2 day) is
connected to the hydrodynamic processes in this region.
At deep-water sites, there is a more ordered vertical distribution of primary production (Piltun
deposit, maximum depth 63 m, and Arcutun-Dagi maximum depth 90 m). At the Arcutun-Dagi site,
the photosynthetic zone ceases at 90 m while in summer months of 1993 it is 40 m (Tech. Report,
1993) and 60 m in 1979 (Eppley and Peterson, 1979).
Within the limits of each site, the variability of primary production is (particularly at Arcutun-
Dagi deposit) from 2.84 gC/m2 day to 0.09 gC/m2 day. Such a mosaic, within the limits of the small
area, testifies to the complexity of the photosynthesis process. The high primary production of waters
at the study site indicates the possible problems that could occur from future industrial development.
Primary production is sensitive to pollution, as is found for the toxic compounds of drilling muds
which suppress photosynthesis (Tech. Report, 1993). As phytoplankton is the primary unit in the
trophic food web, it is not hard determine possible consequence to the system of a toxic event.
Therefore, primary production measurement can be used as main indicator of environmental
conditions and to select harmless drilling mud.
338
The relationship between primary production in the water column and surface phytoplankton
pigment biomass was investigated for the purpose of the determining the opportunities of using
pigment concentration for predicting primary production (Eppley et al., 1985; Perry, 1986). It is
shown that the biomass variability defines many, but far from all factors of primary production.
Thus, the primary production method of research on photosynthesis gives the best representation of
bioproductivity of the ocean. The method permits the simulation of any conditions in situ. In
particular, the influence of various additives on primary production can be produced for guidance in
areas where industrial development is planned.

Some Reasons for Resource Reduction of
Laminaria Japonica (Primorye Region)
Tatyana N. KRUPNOVA
Pacific Research of Fisheries and Oceanography (TINRO)
4, Shevchenko Alley, Vladivostok, 690600, Russia
At the present time, the resources of Laminaria japonica are significantly reduced in three
regions of the Primorye (north, middle and south). Surveys from recent years show that in a large
area there are no commercial fids or they are in a depressed state. This lead to a 1991 closure of
harvesting of Laminaria japonica to allow the stocks to rebuild. To determine the possible causes of
the problem, analysis of growth, biological characteristics, climate and oceanographical condition were
studied.
All three regions occur in the Prymorsky cold current. In the north the conditions are the most
favorable for Laminaria japonica (many biogenes and low water temperature). In the South Primory
region conditions are less favorable as there are less biogens and the temperature is higher (Fig. 1).
North Primorye the plants grow to a larger size and mass and the volume of sporogenesis
tissue is greater than in the South Primorye. For example, in North Primorye one plant weighed 1,000
g and the coefficient of sporogenesis tissue K was 0.7 on a thallus. In the south region plants of
Laminariajaponica weigh 600 g and the K was 0.5. In the middle region the weight is 800 g and K is
0.6 (Fig. 2). These proportions remained relatively stable in the three regions except for one year in
the last 7-8 years when a weakening of the Prymorsky cold current resulted in less growth. For
example, in 1981, in the north one plant weighed 800 g and K was 0.6; in the middle one plant
weighed 500 g and K was 0.3; in the south one plant weighed 300 g and K was 0.2.
During the reproductive cycle in the fall, after zoospores are released to settle and sprout the
temperature is found to fluctuate from 3°C-14°C which causes the destruction of gametophytes (Fig.
3).
Thus, in these years the reduction of sporogenesis tissue causes the death of zoospores that are
already formed.
In the north and middle regions, cold waters results in low growth of rhizoids and
zoospores are unable to attach to the substrate (Fig. 3). All these facts influence the yield of future
years.
Commercial harvesting of Laminaria in Russia is undertaken by divers who only remove the
plant material leaving the rhizoids to grow another year. In the years of reduced productivitiy,
commercial harvesting of Laminaria should be stopped. At least harvesting should be stopped in the
north and middle regions when the cold current causes low productivity. Taking into consideration all
these facts there is an opportunity to use a new method for forecasting Laminaria yield and developing
better management strategies for harvesting the plant.

Mercury in Bottom Sediments of the Northeastern Okhotsk Sea
Lyudmila N. LUCHSHEVA, Anatoliy I. BOTSUL
Pacific Scientific Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (TINRO)
Pacific Oceanological Institute (POI)
To delineate the problem of monitoring mercury in the marine environment, data is needed at
the ecosystem level. For example, data from bottom sediments are of great importance because they
serve to locate where the long-term storage of mercury occurs, which potentially can be reintroduced
into the environment (Hiroshi et al., 1989). In bottom sediments, mercury is transformed by
microbiological activity into a highly toxic methyl-mercuric form which can cause serious ecological
disturbances when incorporated into biota and vice versa (Akagi et al., 1979). Reasonable mercury
levels in the bottom sediments can serve as an indicator of both anthropogenic (waste drain waters,
aerosols, toxic waste burials, etc.) and natural (the seepage from the interior along deep faults, ore
oxidation zones,
disseminated cinnabar deposits) sources in the ocean.
The quantitative estimation of the extent of bottom pollution by mercury was determined using
the flame atomic absorption spectroscopy method (Hatch and Ott, 1968) from bottom sediment probe
samples collected on the R/V "Acad. A.Nesmeyanov" (24' Cruise) in 1993. The grain-size
composition of bottom sediments was determined using the pipette method for estimation of the
correlation between the mercury contents and the structural sedimentary types (Petelin, 1967). A map
of the sediment type distribution has been plotted on the basis of grain-size analysis data (see Fig. 1).
The most coarse-grained sediments (fine psammites) occur within the zone of intensive water-mass
movements in the nearshore region off the west coast of Kamchatka near the Shelikhov Sound neck
where the intra-structural hydrological front is characterized by high biological efficiency
(Chernyavskiy, 1970).
Aleurites and pelites are laid at greater depths where the dynamic activity
causes the accumulation of finely dispersed sediments.
Bottom sediment mercury concentrations vary from 0.006 till 0.028 mcg/g of the dried mass.
The lowest mercury content (0.006 mcg/g) is found in psammites that may be connected with their
weak adsorption properties and with the intensive washout. At increasing depth, growth and particle
size
decreases and the mercury concentration increases up to 0.028 mcg/g due to the high metal
adsorption capacity of the aleuritic fraction of bottom sediments (Duzzin et al., 1988).
When mercury concentrations in bottom sediments of our region are compared with the
background values to determine a criterion for a quantitative pollution level estimation based on the
relative mercury ground accumulation coefficient.
For the Shelikhov Sound neck region, the
coefficient varies from 2 to 4 units. The mercury content excess (relative to the background content) is
a factor of 2-4 in the bottom sediments which was assigned to a category of sediments enriched with
mercury. It should be noted that it was only this area where we observe elevated mercury
concentrations in the near-bottom water layer. The high level is likely due to natural mercury fluid
seepage from the deep earth crust. The mercury transfer is usually effected by alkaline sulfide solution
or from organic compounds incorporated into the carbon bearing gases. The mercury transfer can also
be in a vapour phase (Ozerova and Pikovskiy, 1982).
The tectonics data for the Okhotsk Sea region indicates that the Shelikhov Sound area is
characterized by folded deformations in the earth crust. These deformations are caused by deep seated
345
faults (Gnibidenko and Khvedchuk, 1982).
Tectonic movements along the faults are caused by active
processes within the earth crust and upper mantle and by mantle differentiation. As a whole, our
data
shows that the mercury content values for the bottom sediments (laid within the anomalous mercury
concentration zone in the near-bottom layer) are not high enough to cause environmental
contamination. It was assumed that the mercury entering into the near-bottom water layer is in a vapor
form. As the result of the high water agitation observed, the mercury transfer processes is presumably
dominated by the mercury settling to the bottom surface. Thus, the undesirable action of the toxicant
to biota tends to be diminished.
The data suggested development of a monitoring system for mercury contamination in the
marine environment and for setting estimation criteria in waters and bottom sediments.

ABSTRACT
Carbohydrate binding proteins and carbohydrases are widely used in glycobiology and
biotechnology. In our laboratory galactose specific lectins were isolated from marine invertebrates of
the Japan Sea from the mussel Crenomytilus grayanus and the marine worm Chaetopterus
variopedatus. The peculiar lectin obtained from hemolymph of crab Erimacrus isenbecki showed
affinity to sialic acids and N-acetyl-aminosugars. The lectins were found to bind Ehrlich carcinoma
cells and the humane and animal erythrocytes in various manners. The reaction of agglutination was
inhibited by such glycoproteins as mucin, fetuin, alpha-i-acid glycoprotein.
The mannose specific
lectin isolated from the celomic fluid of the marine cucumber Stichopus japonicus was shown to
interact with high mannose "hybrid type" glycoproteins.
To search for producers of beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase, chitinase and carrageenase, the
screening was carried out using marine bacteria from the Kuril Islands. The low-molecular weight of
kappa- and lambda-carrageenans with potential antiviral activity were obtained by fermentolysis of
natural polysaccharides. In a preparative scale, Chitobiose and chitotetraose were isolated after chitin
degradation with a crude enzyme from marine bacteria KMM B-07.
These substances are useful
intermediates in technology of biologically active substances.
INTRODUCTION
The screening of genetic sources as tools for marine carbohydrate biotechnology is a problem
of modern oceanography. The lectins from plants are very well known (Kilpatrick, et al.
1991;
Gabius and Gabius. 1993). Recently, researchers are being directed to marine organisms (Renwrantz,
1986; Pavlenko et. at., 1990; Hatakeyama et. al., 1993). Special attention is being directed to
substances (oncoprecipitins) which may bind with human oncofetal antigens (Pavlenko et. al., 1990;
Moroz et. at., 1993). The isolated lectins and oncoprecipitins will be useful for diagnosis and therapy
of cancer.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Carbohydrases are useful tools for bioglycans structure investigation and the preparation of
various biologically active substances. A chitinase, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, kappa- and
lambda-carrageenases were obtained from some marine microorganisms.
The following lectins and
carbohydrases were isolated from marine invertebrates and microorganisms of Japan and Okhotsk Seas.
348
Lectin of the mussel Crenomytilus grayanus (CGL)
CGL was isolated from the mussel body using extraction of the mussel homogenate with saline
solution followed by centrifugation and fractionation of the mixture obtained by affinity
chromatography on the hydrolyzed Sepharose 6B or on Lactosyl-Sepharose 4B to yield the purified
lectin.
Using HPLC on TSK G2000SW column or gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 column, the
average molar weight was determined to be 36 kDa. A desegregation of the lectin was observed in the
presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. CGL treated with 2-mercaptoethanol was subjected to sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to show a single band of 18 kDa. These data
demonstrated that the mussel lectin appears to consist of two sub-units.
CGL was found to possess an agglutinating activity in relation to the human erythrocytes
(ABO), sheep erythrocytes and Ehrlch's carcinoma cells. The highest agglutination titer was observed
with the trypsinized human erythrocytes to reach up to maximum value for blood group B. A
maintenance of agglutinability in the wide range of pH-values (2.5-10.0) indicated an occurrence of
reversible alterations in the protein molecule. An inhibition of hemagglutination was achieved with
galactose and derivatives of alpha-D-galactoside demonstrated alpha-D-galactose specificity of CGL.
A peculiarity of the mussel lectin was thermo-stability of the molecule. CGL was found to maintain
agglutination at an elevated temperature of up to 60C.
Lectin of the marine worm Chaetopterus variopedatus ( CVL)
CVL was isolated from fresh marine worms C. variopedatus collected in the sublittoral zone of
Bay of Peter the Great in the Japan Sea. Marine animals harvested were homogenized and subjected to
extraction with a saline solution followed by precipitation with ammonium sulphate. The fraction
obtained was shown to possess a hemagglutinating activity. Hemagglutination was inhibited with
galactose and lactose. In this connection, a purification of CVL was achieved using affinity
chromatography on lactosyl-Sepharose 4B followed by elution of the lectin with an aqueous solutions
of galactose.
The CVL obtained showed a single band on SDS-PAGE with a molar weight ca. 30
kDa.
SDS-PAGE of CVL in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol showed the same single band
demonstrating the absence of disulfide bridges in the lectin. CVL was found to agglutinate all types of
the human erythrocytes. The sheep and rabbit erythrocytes were also agglutinated with CVL. A
treatment of erythrocytes with trypsin was shown to enhance hemagglutinating activity of CVL. In
addition, a high titer of agglutination of the cells of Ehrlich's sarcoma was observed.
An alteration of pH-values of the buffer solutes demonstrated that specific activity of CVL was
maintained in a range of pH 5-9. CVL showed a maximal activity at pH 8. An elevation of
temperature of CVL solutes failed to substantially reduce specific activity up to 40C. A significant lost
of activity occurred on heating at higher temperature. CVL was found to become inactive completely
at 50C.
The minimal concentrations of various monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and glycoproteins
require to completely inhibit agglutinating activity of CVL were determined. The galactose showed a
maximal inhibitory activity among monosaccharides investigated. The inhibition of CVL with N-
acetyl-D-galactosamine was substantially lower than that with galactose. The inhibitory activity of D-
fucose and D-galacturonic acid reduced 3 and 4 fold respectively in comparison with that of D-
galactose. This phenomenon indicated certain participation of the C5-C6 region of sugar in binding the
lectin. An inhibitory
ability of lactose was found to be equal to that of methyl beta-D-
galactopyranoside.
Lactose showed the most inhibition in comparison to raffinose and melibiose.
349
These data were possibly connected with an anomeric configuration of the galactose residue in the
oligosaccharides as follows: beta-galactosyl residue involved in lactose while raffinose and melibiose
contained alpha-galactosyl residues.
Mucin, fetuin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein were found to be effective inhibitors of
hemagglutination. It is noteworthy that desialylation of fetuin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein was
accompanied by a substantial increase of inhibitory activity while the desialylated mucin showed the
same inhibition as the parent glycoprotein. As is known, the neuraminic acid residues occurred at C-6
of the subterminal galactose residue in mucin while C-3 atom was additionally involved in linkages
with the neuraminic acid residues in both the other glycoproteins. This phenomenon demonstrated that
the hydroxyl group at C-6 failed to influence binding the galactose residues of glycoproteins with CVL
while hydroxyl group at C-3 appeared to be very significant for binding glycoproteins with the lectin.
CVL was found to possess a substantial agglutinating activity in relation to the tumour cells due to
oncofetal antigens involved in tumour cells which are known to contain regions which resemble those
of mucin (Mikheyskaya et al, 1995).
The crab Erimacrus isenbeckii lectin (EIL)
A very interesting lectin was isolated from the hemolymph of crab E.isenbeckii (EIL) using
affinity chromatography on bovine serum mucin-agarose column in the presence of Ca-ions. Elution of
EIL was achieved with 0.5M GlcNAc in Tris-HC1 buffer in the absence of Ca-ions. The EIL fraction
was subjected to chromatography on a column with DEAE-Toyopearl 650M to obtain a purified lectin.
SDS-PAGE showed a single band of 70 kDa in the presence or absence of 2-mercaptoethanol
thus indicating the occurrence of a single subunit. Homogenecity of EIL was confirmed by
immunodiffusion against antiserum obtained by immunization of rabbits with a purified hemolymph of
the crab. EIL was shown to represent glycoprotein which contained 2% sugars. An absence of amino
acid residues contained S-atom was a peculiarity of the lectin.
EIL was found to agglutinate the human A, B, 0 erythrocytes. More high agglutinability was
observed in relation to erythrocytes digested with trypsin. The sugar specificity of the lectin was
elucidated using inhibition of EIL-hemagglutination with various sugars. The lectin agglutinability was
inhibited with aminosugars (G1cNAc, Ga1NAc), with N-acetyl neuraminic acid (NANA) and
glycoproteins which contain NANA residues (mucin, fetuin et. al.). In addition, uronic acids (G1cUA,
Ga1UA) and KDO (2-keto-3-deoxy-octonic acid)-containing lipopolysaccharides were found to inhibit a
hemagglutination of EIL.
Hemagglutinating activity of EIL was estimated to continue in the range of pH-values from 7
to 10. Activity was half a maximum at pH 6. EIL was shown to afford a precipitate at
pH-values less
th an 4. EIL showed thermostability at the interval of temperature from 4 up to 40C. Its
agglutinability was completely maintained at 37C for 30 min. Half an activity was observed at 50C.
Activity was shown to disappear completely at 60C for 10 min. EIL was shown to represent Ca
dependent protein similar to lectins from other species of crabs. The agglutination activity of EIL was
completely lost after dialysis with a buffer containing EDTA. An addition of Ca-ions led to restoration
of hemagglutination of EIL.
The marine cucumber Stichopus japonicus lectin (SJL-M)
SLJ-M was found in celomic fluids of S. japonicus by affinity chromatography on mannan-
Sepharose 4B. Lectin agglutinated human group 0 and rabbit erythrocytes. The hemagglutination was
350
inhibited by yeast mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and extra cellular mannan from Vibrio
flavialis.
Two other lectins described early from cucumber's body have specificity to galactose
(Hatakeyama et al, 1993). Such variability of the carbohydrate binding molecules to one organism is
convincing that the Ocean might possibly be a good source of genetic information.
The mannose-binding proteins have various physiological activity and participate actively in
the homeostasis and the defense of macroorganisms (Ohta et al, 1994; Nermes et al, 1995).
Carrageenases from marine microorganisms
The search for the enzymes which specifically degrade carrageenan (sulphatated galactan from
red alga) is urgent because of its low molecular weight it is used in cosmetics and medicine.
(Akagawa-Matsushita et al, 1992; Luk'yanov et al, 1995). The screening of carrageenases bacterial
producers were carried out among epibiotic microorganisms of Rodophitae and microbes from various
species of decomposed red algae as result of accessing 20 bacterial cultures capable of growing on
solid kappa-carrageenan medium. Four strains had the highest enzyme production. The enzyme
secretion was observed to be maximal in the period between 21 and 30 hours from start of bacterial
growth in a 0.5% carrageenan medium.
Crude enzymes were obtained from the 25 h cultural medium of the most promising strains
(KMM SW-4f, KMM 12-3, KMM 10-32). The enzymes purified by 40-70% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation
with following gel chromatography had a specific activity of 10-20 units per mg protein which were
determined by color reaction of reducing carbohydrates with 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrasolium chloride with
0.25% carrageenans as substrate. The enzyme preparation was shown to be cryo-stable (after freezing-
thawing it lost only 15% activity) and to have pH-optimum in the range of 5.5-7.0.
The isolated enzyme hydrolyzed kappa-carrageenan as it was shown by the decrease of
polysaccharide solution viscosity and gel permeation chromatography. Low molecular weight
carrageenan had molecular mass of 30-50 kDa.
Chitinase and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) from bacteria
The complex of enzymes which hydrolyzes chitin (poly- beta-(1,4)-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminide)
in living organisms consists of chitinase and (or) NAGase [ ]. The chitinase degrades polysaccharide
to chitobiose, NAGase to N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. These compounds of polysaccharide fermentolysis
are useful in biotechnology for synthesis of various biologically active substances. The high
chitooligosaccharides are essentially interesting as substrates for lysozyme and syntons for preparation
of glycolipids with immunostimulating activity.
The perspective bacterial strains (32) were found by the screening of more 200 chitinolytic
strains from a Collection of Marine Microorganism (Pacific Institute of Bio-Organic Chemistry, FEB
RAS, Vladivostok).
Six of them had only chitinase activity. An enzymatic preparation was obtained
from KMM B-07 culture by 40-70% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. The chitobiose ( 37% from chitin),
chitotetraose ( 8%) and chitohexaose (1.5%) were prepared by polysaccharide fermentolysis using this
enzymatic preparation in a preparative scale.
Thus,
it has been shown that the Ocean is a rich source of carbohydrate-binding and
polysaccharide-hydrolyzing molecules as described above. The lectins isolated will be investigated for
there diagnostic significance in use for oncological diseases.

Among existing approaches, the analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphism
seems to be the most feasible for the genetic marking of populations and separate stocks of Pacific
salmon. However, the restriction endonuclease analysis of whole mtDNA from chum salmon
(Oncorhynchus keta Walb.) and coho salmon (0. kisutch Malb.) as well as of its fragments, amplified
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrates the low level of intraspecific variability in these
species of salmon (Ginatulina et al., 1988; Cronin et al., 1993). The use of the expensive direct
sequencing for the mass screening and identification of populations, stocks and individuals is
cumbersome.
The DNA fingerprinting technique (Wright, 1993) seems to be more useful but not less
informative, including the recent approaches for the analysis of mtDNA polymorphisms as based on
the PCH with a single primer (SP) PCR (Derenko and Malyarchuk, 1994), and low-stringency (LS)
SP-PCR (Pena et al., 1994). The LSSP-PCR of the human mtDNA results in the set of PCR-products,
whose quantity and distribution pattern depends on the type, quantity and character of mutational
events in the studied DNA segment (Pena et al., 1994).
In this paper we present the results of LSSP-PCR fingerprinting of mtDNA genome of chum
salmon which enable genetic identification at an individual level. This level partly includes the family
due to the matrilinear inheritance of mtDNA (Avise and Lanchman, 1983) and maternally akin
individuals possess the identical mitochondrial genomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Standard methods were used to isolate the mtDNA from salmon muscle. The fragments from
the control region of mtDNA (about 1,300 by long) are amplified with the primers L15926 and H651
using conditions described by Kocher et al. (1989). The PCR products are isolated from the gel of
LNP agarose (BioRad) and reamplified, using some modifications in the process, with the L15926
primer under LSSP-PCR conditions as described by Pena et al. (1994). The reaction mixture contains
Taq-buffer (according to Hertzberg et al., 1989), dNTPs, 15 ng of DNA template, 48 pN of primer
and 2.5U of Taq DNA polymerase. DNA is amplified under 35 two-phase cycles (1 min at 93° and 1
min at 30°).
LSSP-PCR products are fractionated in 5 % polyacrylamide gel and stained by silver
(Brandt et al., 1992).
The fragments of 5-ended cytochrome b gene region 375 by long are amplified with the Bi and
B2 primers (Kocher et al., 1989).
Restriction analysis of cytochrome b gene of chum salmon is
performed using restriction endonucleases Alul, HaeI1I, Hinfi, Mspl, and RsaI from MBI Fermentas,
353
Lithuania. LSSP-PCR fingerprinting of products of the first PCR round is performed using the B1
primer. The PCR and analysis conditions are identical to those described above for the mtDNA
control region.
The mathematical analysis of data include the construction of binary matrix where the columns
correspond to the individuals and lines to the found segments with 1 and 0 elements according to the
presence or absence of segmentation, respectively.
Distinction coefficients (D) are calculated by
dividing the number of segments which differ in the compared individuals by the sum of all segments
found.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The feasibility of a single primer PCR (LSSP-PCR technique) for the analysis of intraspecific
variability of mtDNA control region was recently demonstrated for humans (Pena et al., 1994) and fur
seal (author's unpublished data).
This technique results in a set of fragments of mtDNA which is
specific for species and individuals. The employment of the method described above for the analysis
of mtDNA control region allows the identification of several samples of chum salmon and coho
salmon. These results were unexpected since the non-coding regions of mtDNA in vertebrates possess
a marked structural closeness, being significantly variable (Cantatore and Saccone,
1987).
The information about the variability of coding regions of a genome whose evolution more
corresponds to a neutrally selective one is of consequence in the case of evolutionary and population
genetic studies. In this case the character of accumulation of genome changes during molecular
evolution looks to reflect the sequence of evolutionary changes in individuals, populations, species etc.
The cytochrome b (cyt b) gene of mtDNA is among such regions whose polymorphisms are used in the
phylogenetic studies in animals (Irwin et al., 1991).
This protein (cyt b) has a rather conservative
aminoacid sequence but the nucleotide sequence of the responsible gene possesses both intraspecific
and higher range variations. The RFLP analysis reveals the mitochondrial genomes of such salmons as
chum salmon and coho salmon have a somewhat low polymorphism thus making a genetic analysis
difficult (Ginatulina et al., 1988; Cronin et al., 1993). Thus, we attempt to estimate the variability of
evolutionary conservative cytb gene of chum salmon by means of PCR-fingerprinting.
We formerly demonstrate the low variability of cyt b gene of chum salmon by RFLP
(Radchenko and Malyarchuk, 1995). One half of the sampled fish are characterized by 5A mitotype
and the remainder by 5B mitotype. In this paper we use ILSSP-PCR fingerprinting to assess the
variability of cytb gene in four chum salmon fish (sampled in Yana river, Magadan region).
The
RFLP shows these salmons to have 5A mitotype (samples Nl and N2) and 5B mitotype (N3 and N4).
The LSSP-PCR spectra is characterized by a significant band variability. The number of bands sized
(1,800 - 80 bp) per sample varies between 20 and 24.
The individual differences in the number,
position and intensive bands dominate in the LSSP-PCR spectra. The pair comparison of spectra show
the variation in the number of common bands is 10 to 17. The samples Nl and N2 which had common
5A mitotype also shows the greatest similarity in LSSP-PCR spectra (D=0.652).
However the
samples N3 and N4 which also belong to a common mitotype 5B had fingerprints differing (D=0.74)
from the pairs N2-N3 and Nl-N3 (D=0.733 and 0.724 respectively).
Our results point out the existence of a rather high level of diversity of cyt b gene in chum
salmon which could not be proven by RFLP. LSSP-PCR-fingerprinting which has a higher resolving
ability could, evidently, be recommended for studies in the micro-differentiation of populations as well
as for separate stocks of salmon. This approach allows estimation of the real levels of genetic
354
variability in populations and it
is hoped to enable the elaboration of techniques for marking
populations according to LSSP-PCB spectra and estimating the degree of kinship of populations.

Chaos and Relaxation in Dynamics of the Pink Salmon
(Oncorhynchus Gorbuscha) Returns for Two Regions
Alexander A. MIKHEEV

INTRODUCTION
"... Simple non-linear systems do not necessarily
possess the simple dynamics properties".
Robert May. 1991
At present, the ecology of Oncorhynchus gorbuscha has been well studied (Birman, 1985).
Pink salmon live in the freshwater for a very short period and migrate great distances in the ocean.
Pink salmon tagging indicate that the frequency and the range of deviation from native rivers when
returning to spawn is inversely related (Maksimovich, 1991). It seems quite reasonable to propose,
that migration fluctuations are produced by the environment and represent system noise in nature.
Consequently, there is some probable pink salmons population structure fluctuation.
The strays join
existing stocks to form new stocks without contradiction of the concept of fluctuation (Glubokovsky
and Jivotovsky, 1986) and local (Ivankov, 1993) stocks, compete with strays from other stocks. This
would mean that there is a statistical relationship of returns to different spawning sites.
We emphasise that the length of life of pink salmon has been determined with enough
precision. The pink salmon hatch and leave for the ocean to return to spawn and die. This results in a
chain of generations that do not overlap in time, but with strict reciprocal correspondence.
It may be
said that nature displays a biological model of known mathematical formulation: discreet mapping of a
segment of the real straight line onto itself (Haken, 1985;
Shuster, 1988; Ahromeeva et al., 1992;
Sharkovsky, 1964; May, 1976; Feigenbaum, 1979).
Correspondence of mapping as a model of a natural prototype in many respects will be
determined by the mapping parameters. It is assumed, that the most generalised demographic
parameters, that reflect the biological state of a population, are reproduction and carrying capacity
(Odum, 1975).
Reproduction integrates such characteristics as mortality, fertility and sex in pink salmon.
These characteristics depend on a great number of factors, where the change in the scale of the time
period is much less than the length of the reproductive cycle.
Examples of the main groups of such
factors are: weather, sea and river waters state, currents, anthropogenous activity and predation.
Eventually changes in combinations of these factors take place that are specific to a region.
As a
result, local spatial fluctuations of the habitat appear. As solitary fluctuations are weekly forecast, it is
more advisable to regard them as stochastic noise. Noise is present in almost all natural processes
(Haken, 1985; Shuster, 1988; Ahromeeva et al., 1992).
The influence of fluctuations on discrete
mapping is analysed in general (Haken, 1985; Shuster, 1988; Wull et al., 1984) and in a particular
case of disturbance of reproduction by white noise (Rabinovitch and Thieberger, 1988).
356
The scale of carrying capacity change corresponds
to the scale of climatic change. Climate as
a global factor is displayed in a similar way for different stock reproduction.
Birman (1985) and
Chigirinsky (1993) advanced and substantiated the
thesis of a correlative connection between long-term
pink salmon abundance and global climate variations.
The role of climatic epoches in marine
ecosystems was analysed by V.P. Shuntov (1993).
.
Taking into account the existing problems of forecasting pink
salmon spawning abundance, it
is necessary to study, in general, the role and contribution
of external factors in affecting returns.
RESEARCH METHODS
The influence of the environment
on the abundance of pink salmon spawning returns is studied
using a simple model based on "'logistic" mapping of
real straight line segments (May, 1976) with
perturbed parameters.
Reproduction is subjected to accidental non-correlative fluctuations and the
carrying capacity changed quasi-periodically following global
climatic variations. The model used
was:
(1) xn = Xn /Kn,6 <- xn <- A,n = 0,1,...,N,
(Kn /Kn+1)(r+sn)xn(1-xn), if 6 <_xn <1,
(2)
xn+1 =
5, if 1<<_xn <<-A,
3
(3) Kn =K+sg Zsin(7tn/Tm +(pm),
m=1
where controlling parameters r>0 and K>0 characterise
pure reproduction and carrying capacity,
respectively. Xn is a return number;
xn belongs to a segment of the real positive number [6, A],
where A is the greatest of numbers
xn, n = 0,N ; the n index of year return and discreteness of one
iteration corresponds to a two
years period. The quantity en is white noise with parameters 0 and a;
sx is
the standard deviation of abundance during N
years; Tm is a period and qm a phase of harmonic
with index m in the trend of carrying capacity changes;
ir=3.14.... Periods, Tm9 m=1, 2, 3, are
equal to 11, 22, and 45 years, respectively, and phases
=1.2ir, 92=0.5ir and 93=1.6 r are
selected so, that maximums will lie in the neighbourhood
of 1989 (Shuntov, 1993).
Shifts of the
process with respect to adjacent generations is accomplished by changing the index
n by half of the
iteration step.
A small parameter S corresponds to the number of individuals,
labile to the most
unfavourable changes of the external environment.
The equations (1) - (3) set a stochastic process,
known as a Marcov chain (Rabinovitch and Thieberger,
1988).
The simulation process consists of setting
an initial value of x0 from actual time series and
reconstruction of the model time series according
to x0 by the set parameters r, K, a, S of model (1) -
(3).
The model is tested on time series of pink
salmon abundance returns of "even" and "odd"
yearclasses (Birman, 1985) in two regions for
the period 1970 - 1993.
Location of regions with
respect to each other is shown in the Fig. 1. For each model iteration
the correlation coefficient R and
standard deviation s relative to actual series
are calculated.
For every combination of parameters (r,
K, a, S) 100 iterations took place, by which
a frequency spectrum f(R) is produced. The position of
the extreme right mode of spectrum
serves as a criterion of model quality.
That combination of
357
parameters is considered to be the best, by which the quality criterion approaches the maximum value
Rmax The last iteration is calculated by the gradient descent method (Bundy, 1988).
Using mode values, cross tabulations of R and s, the discriminating signs for parameters
formally stood out in the form of couples (R, s). All outputs received in the process of modelling are
classified with the help of discriminate analysis. Properties of return dynamics are studied comparing
probability appearance characteristics of corresponding class, number, size, distribution and fluctuation
in the time period for each output. The known characteristics of discrete mapping with noise were
used.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Results of parameter identification are presented in Table 1. The sensitivity of quality
criterion
Rmax to
the estimates of parameters (for exception of rather arbitrary parameter 8) appear to
be an order higher for even year generations.
The spectrum f(R) for optimum the combination of parameters by region and generations are
shown in the Fig. 2. The quantity Rmax corresponds to the position of the extreme right line of all
spectrums. Otherwise, the most similar output appears to be the most probable. By the figure one can
compare the output with the actual dynamics for every region.
We note, that optimum values of r and a form couples equal for the generations of the same
eveness independently of the region. In Fig. 3 theoretical distributions of r are shown for even and
odd year generations, respectively. The upper 99% percentile in these generations is practically the
same and equal to r0.99= rf = 4.5. Thus, every couple (r, a) is determined by the equality r + 3a
rf
Of 1,000 outputs modelled by optimum parameters, there are five classes with peculiar values
of R and s for every region and generation. For example, in Fig. 4 the classes for odd-year
generations of Region 1 are shown. Visually comparing the morphometry of typical points of the
discriminating output allows the setting of each class of output to possess a specific stable fluctuation
distribution which makes a specific generalised image of the output dynamic class pattern. We point
out the signs of the chosen classes and probability of their appearance: class with signs (R, s)=(0.75;
0.28) has probability 0.13; (R, s)=(0.65;0.32)-0.14; (0.55;0.28)-0.30; (0.55;0.32)-0.30; class
(0.45;0.38)-0.13. Stability of patterns indicate the natural development and relation of fluctuations.
Of the known properties of logistic mapping, it follows that the rate of fluctuation growth is higher for
the value of perturbed reproduction (r + en). Fluctuations of the order axn are distributed
accidentally and homogeneously in the time period. Global fluctuations of the order K+3sx have a
periodicity of the climatic trend and taking into account the rate of growth are distributed in the time
period by secluded groups of one to two "splashes".
We discuss output values for r and a. The high individual fertility of pink salmon is
considered to be 2,000 eggs (Birman, 1985). If it is assumed that the sex ratio is close to 1:1 and for
every thousands eggs, 5 spawners return, then r f = 2,000x0.5x0.005=5.
This is not a bad
correspondence allowing interpretation of rf as a species reproductive maximum and equality r + 3a
= rf finds the meaning. On the other hand pink salmon population density regulation of reproduction
is connected with the heterogeneous conditions for maturing and surviving and interspecies competition
for the best habitat conditions (Birman, 1985). Thus the reproduction r of generations of low
abundance will be greater, and the variability of reproduction a smaller and their relationship is
determined by the equality for rf, cited above. Will the obtained correspondence values of r and a to
358
theoretical distributions of reproductions for generations with different level of abundance (Fig. 3) be
greatly strengthened, if it is possible to find an explanation of the fact that values of r appear to be
equal for generations of the same eveness, independent of the region? Such explanation is found in the
properties of logistic mapping (Haken, 1985; Shuster, 1988; Ahromeeva et al., 1992; Sharkovsky,
1964; May, 1976; Feigenbaum, 1979; Wull et al., 1984; Rabinovitch and Thieberger, 1988). A
parameter r change leads to the consequent replacement of the dynamic types of quantity xn. At r =
2.5, the value of xn approaches a non-zero equilibrium, at r = 3.25 periodic oscillations appear in the
dynamics, at r = 3.25 the number of harmonics begins to redouble to the chaos which appears at r =
4.0. The theoretical basis of the universality of bifurcation of values r is given by M. Feigenbaum
(1979) (Feigenbaum, 1979), and the considered scenario of transition from equilibrium to chaos bears
his name. Rabinovitch and Thieberger (1988) indicate that the influence of white noise on
reproduction r in logistic mapping supports the scenario of Feigenbaum. Evidently any change of K is
a simple transformation of the scale in the mapping, and also it cannot change the Feigenbaum
scenario.
If the model represents nature, then when the density of spawning change is due to density
regulation, there must be a transition from one type of dynamics to another according to Feigenbaum's
scenario. Formally, we call this phenomenon the capability of pink salmon to adapt. Close location of
r to bifurcation values speaks in favour of the existence of factors connected with abundance that at
low level change chaotically and at high level relax after external influence on the equilibrium state.
So, pink salmon generations with stable high abundance tend to depress fluctuations from outside,
whereas generations with stable low abundance show the capability to increase fluctuations within.
Such behaviour follows the reproductive strategy, the aim of which is to keep up the stock to an
abundance level as high as possible for a specific region. In suitable external conditions, the strategy
is able to lead to "dominant" generation replacement (Birman, 1985).
The presence of chaos and non-linearity in pink salmon returns indicated the problem of
forecasting which can not be solved within the frameworks of traditional approaches. Discussing these
problems is beyond the scope of this paper. May (1991) has worked out the non-linear dynamics of
chaos forecasting and suggests the algorithm for a solution (May, 1991).

selection, treatments are performed that prohibit fertilization of eggs by defective sperms.
RESULTS

The dry method of fertilization provid s an equal opportunity for all sperms to fertilize an egg.
The quality of fertilized eggs from late ma ring males produce a poor quality of progeny. A
significant amount of dead embryos and dead y along with an increase in the of ratio of males were
observed. Sperm selection (SS) results in a ecrease of these indices (Tables 1 and 2). Apparently,
salmons which have more gene defects grow lower and therefore they become matured later. If the
sperms of late spawning males are selected ag inst by sperm selection the quality indices of progeny is
improved (Tables 1 and 2).
The use of SS from early maturing m les reduces the number of dead embryos (Tables 4 and
5) and increases the of sizes and weight of fry of chum (Table 3).
Fluctuating body asymmetry (FA) of c um is found to indicate the presence of significant small
genetic errors during development. The number of body spots along the sides of fry is not an
important feature, however, when the level of spots FA is high, the gill raker FA is significantly
reduced and the pores FA on pre operculum i the least high (Table 5). The indices of FA of progeny

without SS is even lower than those of wild chum. The decrease of FA took place with the decrease
progeny mortality and numbers of males. All these indices appear to reflect a process of reduction in
the number of defective genes in progeny without SS.
The indices of FA indicates an increase in small gene errors during development.
The FA
indices are more sensitive than the other methods that we used. For instance, mortality because sperm
selection also decreases the FA in progeny of early spawning salmons (Table 5).
SS decreases the
number of males too. According to Geodakyan (1987) the high number of males used is an index of
the extent of population degeneration. It corresponds to the summarized data of FA change from our
work. The FA decreases when male numbers decreases.
The method of sperm selection is also important to reproductive success for chinook 0.
tshawytcha of Kamchatka. The experiments are carried out using wild individuals from late spawning
fish. The life history of chinook differs from other Pacific salmons as this salmon spawns in rapidly
moving rivers waters and the sperm is more active than those of chum and pink salmon. Using the dry
method of fertilization of chinook eggs (control) significantly decreases the of number of females
(33.4%) which leads to an equal number of females and males.
Thus, sperm selection leads to a
decrease in the level of fluctuation asymmetry.
The connection of FA with viability and heredity of Salmon gairdneri is described in radiation
ginogenesis experiments (Leary et al., 1985).
The SS method prevents the exposure of chum fry to unfavorable factors found in the
environment such as oxygen deficiency. The SS influence on FA growth rate increases resistance to
unfavorable factors from the environment which increases the number of females. We suppose that all
these changes of features are based on small heredity defects in genes.
We suppose it to be important to discuss the differences of salmons of one population at the
end and in beginning of spawning. N. Kulikova (1983) studied early and late spawning

gairdneri. The survival of progeny from the late maturing females decrease to 63% fecundity (1,890
eggs) and the number of cells with chromosomes aberrations increases up to 23%. The progeny of
females of early maturity is distinguished by high level of survival (87%) and fecundity (3,050 eggs)
and also a decrease in the number of cells with chromosome aberrations (9%).
Low levels
chromosome aberrations is an important positive index.
It shows stability of the heredity process.
Thus, the early maturing Atlantic salmons produce more viable progeny.
CONCLUSIONS
1. Fertilization by late spawning male salmon using the dry method of fertilization of eggs leads to a
significant high level of heredity defects in the progeny.
2. The method of sperm selection decreases the amount of large and small defects in the salmon
produced and in the number males produced.

Abundance of Young Halibut along the West Kamchatka Shelf
in 1982-1992
Larisa P. NIKOLENKO
Pacific Research Fisheries Centre (TINRO), Vladivostok, Russia
The Sea of Okhotsk is a marginal habitat for Pacific halibut, thus, it is less abundant than in
the Bering sea and Pacific waters where a specialized fishery occurs. In the past, Sea of Okhotsk
Pacific halibut have not been targeted for special investigation. There is some biological data but
information on abundance has not been available. The Sea of Okhotsk halibut occurs all along the
shelf on the upper continental slope but relatively stable accumulations were only observed on the West
Kamchatka shelf. Data collected by expeditions for fishes (other than halibut) and invertebrates were
analyzed keeping in mind that the sampling scheme may not have been appropriate for use in
determining halibut abundance.
Abundance calculations were made using the method of squares (Aksyutina, 1968), adjusted
for a trawl efficiency coefficient of 0.4.
30-85 cm individuals at age 4+ - 9+ were 80-95% of the catch by longline and trawl (Table
1). Thus, the West Kamchatka shelf appears to be a region for young Pacific halibut feeding migration
in the Sea of Okhotsk. In 1982 the estimated abundance was 1.7 min. and by 1989 it increased to 13.1
min., while distribution increased three times from 3,149 to 9,163 sq.mile (Table 2, Fig. 1). At the
same time, the abundance of halibut in the Pacific waters of Kamchatka increased (Bakkala, 1993;
Kodolov et al., 1994). The increases in both areas may have been due to a shift in abundance and
distribution throughout the region as a result of better conditions for halibut. From the early 90s
western Kamchatka halibut abundance decreased to 6.5 min by 1992 and the distribution also decreased
in the area.
It is difficult to determine what were the causes of the fluctuations from the data available.
However, a comparison 1989 and 1993 length frequencies from trawl catches indicated a decrease in
the 50-70 cm length category from 63.6 to 39.9% of the total. On this evidence, it can be proposed
that in the early 90s there was a decrease in survival and a shift in the distribution from the mid-80s.
Without direct evidence, however, it is difficult to know if there has actually been a shift in survival
and distribution of Okhotsk halibut. Large individuals were mainly found near the Kuril Islands, along
the West Kamchatka slope, in the north area of Sea of Okhotsk and eastern Sakhalin areas. Gill nets
and trawls used to catch turbot, crab traps and the cod long-lines were likely responsible for removing
halibut but the available data are poor. Thus, it is difficult to determine shifts in the migration of
young halibut off West Kamchatka.

Living Conditions of Golden King Crab Lithodes aequispina
in the Okhotsk Sea and near the Kuril Islands
Sergey A. NIZYAEV
Sakhalin Research Institute of Fisheries & Oceanography (SakhNIRO)
196, Komsomolskaya Street, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Russia. 693016
In 1968 fishery information on golden king crab became available from Japanese vessels under
a special pot fishery contract in the central part of the Okhotsk Sea (55°- 56°N, 147°-150°E). The first
TINRO research on this crab on the continent slope of West Kamchatka was in August-September 1969
when a trawl survey was carried out at depths of 250-850 in to collect information on the biology,
distribution and commercial importance of golden king crab (Rodin, 1970). Further investigations in
the Northeast Okhotsk Sea were carried out in 1972, 1973, 1975-1977 but they did not focus on the
golden king crab. In the spring-summer of 1989, an extensive trawl survey of the Okhotsk Sea to a
depth of 2,000 m was carried out, except for the zone adjacent to the Kuril Islands. For the first time
samples were collected of golden king crab over the continental slope throughout the Okhotsk Sea
(Nizyaev, 1992). In 1991 a survey for golden king crab stocks in the Kuril Islands was undertaken
using commercial crab vessels equipped with deep-water pots. Thus, directed research on golden king
crab in Okhotsk Sea only started in the last 5-7 years but was limited to depths less than 200-300 in.
There are always a number of difficulties with developing an investigation on the biology of a species
where samples were collected from 200-600 in. and until recently crab pots were the main gear used by
commercial fisheries and research. The pots are a highly size selective and some biological
measurements are difficult to obtain unless the catching methods are modified to overcome the
problem.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data were collected during trawl and pot surveys in the Okhotsk Sea from 1989-1994.
Samples were collected using a 48-m trawl towed at 3 knots for one hour and by modified standard
American trapezium pots of 175x175 cm in base, 90x90 cm in upper edge and 80 cm in height.
Analysis of the data was according to "Guidance of studies of the Far-East Seas commercial Decapoda"
(1979).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
From the 1989 trawl survey golden king crab was caught near West Kamchatka and to the west
along the north coast of the Sea of Okhotsk to 142°30' E (Fig. 1). A high percent of crab was also
caught by commercial nets for halibut near Northeast Sakhalin. Trawl catches of commercial crab
averaged 10-20 per trawl.
Crab caught from a stock discovered by trawling on Kashevarov bank
averaged from 21 to 35 per pot. As a whole, the distribution of golden king crab in the open part of
the Okhotsk Sea was similar from West Kamchatka to East Sakhalin except along 152°E where females
and small males were absent and catches of commercial males did not exceed 1-2 per trawl.
371
In the area of Kuril Islands golden king crab was distributed all along all the ridge
and near a
group of islands. The greatest concentrations were found near the
islands of Shiashkotan, Ushishir,
Simushir and Iturup. Pot catches of commercial crab were 25-35 per pot.
The spatial structure of golden king crab was generally associated with local
reproductive
groups.
Distribution of non commercial males and mature females was more local than that
of
commercial males. Non commercial males (of small size) were usually found near breeding areas
in
association with juvenile females the group that tended to migrate the least of all size groups.
Mature
females concentrated in high densities together with mature males. Some of the mature
males located
with the females took part in spawning while another assemblage of males were located
in the outlying
area of the female assemblage representing a reproductive potential.
Differences between golden king crab living conditions in the open part of the Okhotsk
Sea and
near the Kuril Islands were determined, mainly, from non-biological
factors. With rare exception, the
open area of the Okhotsk Sea is a plateau without sharp changes
in depth allowing migration over long
distances between different groups resulting in a mixing of genetic material. The Kuril
Islands area on
the other hand has sharp changes in depth on the bottom resulting in groups
being isolated by
restricting movement and the exchange of genetic material.
The genetic link between groups can also be kept up through larvae transport. Larvae
of such
crab species such as red king crab (Paralithodes camtschatica) and blue king crab (P.
platypus) drift in
the surface layer of the sea where they are dependant of surface currents.
Golden king crab larvae
behaviour is thought to be different by many authors. Somerton (1981) compared the
developed yolk
sac of Lithodes couesi (a close relative of golden king
crab) with the red king crab larvae and
expressed doubt of the necessity of Lithodes couesi larvae to migrate to the photic zone.
Somerton and
Otto (1986) advanced the hypothesis that the large size of golden king crab larvae
in contrast to red
king crab larvae allow them to go without food for longer periods and feed on large
organisms. In the
early stages of larvae development golden king crab may be lecythotrophic
feeders resulting in a
demersal type of existence, -while shallow living shelf species larvae are planctotrophic.
This idea is
confirmed from the behaviour of the larvae of the deep-water crabs of genus
Lithodidae which have not
been found in the plancton layer, while larvae of red and blue king crab have been
found in large
numbers in the sea surface layer (Hoffman, 1968; Kurata, 1964; Marukawa, 1933;
Takeuchi, 1962).
In the Kuril Islands there is almost complete lack of crabs that have planktotrophic
larvae. This is
thought to be related to the powerful currents which could carry the larvae away
from areas where they
could settle to the bottom.
Golden king crab is common to these areas which suggests that
larvae
development is independent surface currents.
Thus, in the Kuril Islands the golden king crab is
isolated by the topography and through larval drift limiting genetic exchange compared to
the stocks
living in the open part of the Okhotsk Sea.
High concentrations of crab on small isolated areas near the Kuril Islands may produce
high
catches per effort but lead to a false impression about the size of the stocks.
Intensive harvesting
would result in a sudden reduction of catch rate and it would take years to recover
the lost biomass.
On the plateau near the Shiashkotan and Lovushka Islands the average catches per
effort decreased
from 28 to 9 per pot over three years and the mode of males decreased from 210 for
175 mm carapace
width. Lower harvest rates by adjusting commercial pressure on isolated stocks that are not
connected
need to be implemented to prevent over fishing and to allow recovery of stocks that
have already been
over exploited. Stocks in the open Okhotsk Sea remain more
stable unless fishing pressure becomes to
great for the rate of replacement of the stock biomass.

Settlements of Japanese Scallop in
Reid Pallada Bay (Sea of Japan)
Ludmila A. POZDNYAKOVA and Alla V. SILINA
Institute of Marine Biology
Far-East Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, Vladivostok 690041, Russia
INTRODUCTION
Reid Pallada Bay (northwestern part of Possjet Bay of the Sea of Japan) is the major scallop
cultivation area in eastern Russia. The cultivation of the scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensis (Jay)
involves collection of spat, spat rearing in nursery-cages for one year and the transfer of juveniles to
the bottom culture sites for 2-3 years until they are an acceptable size (100 mm)(Belogrudov, 1986).
Usually cultured juveniles are seeded in low density natural scallop populations. Over the last 20
years, cultured scallop in the bight of Reid Pallada Bay have replaced native populations. The purpose
of this study was to delineate the stocks, the percentage of cultured and natural individuals, age and
size composition and to compare the growth rates of seeded and natural scallops at six sites in Reid
Pallada Bay.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A Scuba survey of Reid Pallada Bay was undertaken along transects perpendicular to the coast
line to 15 m depth. The number of natural and introduced scallops were counted in a 1 m wide band
or in a 1 m frame, depending on the settlement density. To determine the growth, size and age
structure of population 106-500 individuals were collected.
The shell height, wet weight, tissue weight and adductor muscle weight were determined. The
age and linear growth of each scallop were determined from the microsculpture of the surface of the
upper valve (Silina, 1978). The same method was used to reconstruct the individual linear growth of
each scallop and to estimate the mean growth of scallops from each site. Scallops seeded into natural
settlements were distinguished from the natural individuals by the presence of a noticeable mark in the
elementary growth ring of the microsculpture in the upper valve surface which was caused during
transport and seeding on the bottom. The year of transfer to the grounds of each scallops was
determined from their age. The growth of cultured scallops in different years was compared with
resident individuals.
RESULTS
All sites had an irregular strip like distribution of scallops with density 0.1-7.0 (in the main
0.5-5.0) per m. This was considerably higher than in natural settlements due to seeding to increase
profits.
The scallop shell height was 30-165 mm (1-12 years old) (Table 1) but the size and age
distributions of the seeded scallops were differed from natural scallop. The maximum age in each
population was found to occur in the cultured scallops but cultured scallops were smaller at age than
resident (Table 2). The highest growth rates were in the northwest part of Reid Pallada Bay and in
375
Temp Bay, where they reached the commercial size at 3 years old. On the other studied sites scallops
reached the harvest size at 4. The total number and weight of scallops on all six sites (127 hectares)
was about 1,200,000 individuals weighing 240 tons.
During August 1990 the estimated harvestable
biomass was about 98.1 tons total weight and 17.8 t muscle weight.
DISCUSSION
An irregular strip like distribution was characteristic for cultured scallops in the study sites due
to the method of seeding. Cultured scallops had a smaller shell height than the resident individuals of
the same age (about one year) at the time of transfer, which was due to slower growth of juveniles in
the nursery cages during the first year.
After transfer the scallops need time for adaptation to new
conditions and for regeneration of the growing edge of the shell which was usually broken during
transportation to the grounds. The resulting difference in shell height usually remains throughout life
(Pozdnyakova and Silina, 1993; Pozdnyakova et al. 1992;
Silina et al. 1994). The growth rate of
cultured scallop in the studied sites of Possjet Bay was slower than in most other areas of Peter the
Great Bay (Silina and Pozdnyakova, 1986; Silina, 1990; Silina et al. 1994). The high water
temperature (16 to 26 C) in July-September is thought to inhibit growth (Silina, 1983;
Silina and
Pozdnyakova, 1986) which means the scallops were not harvest size until about 4 years old.
The number of the resident scallops before introducing cultivated juveniles was small at five of
the sites studied.
The encouragement of natural scallop settlement on the bottom of Possjet Bay
enhances productivity of commercial beds and there is good production of spat for artificial collection
and rearing in nurse-cages for later seeding. This reduces the need for cultivation and transportation to
the grounds which reduces the expenses as well as the adaptation after seeding.

Features of the Southwest Okhotsk Sea Herring
Galina M. PUSHNIKOVA
Sakhalin Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (SakhNIRO)

A number of independent herring populations with different levels of abundance, in the Far-
East Seas, are in the process of changing (Svetovidov, 1952).
Herring inhabiting Sakhalin waters
differ from others because they have a more complex intraspecies
structure (Frolov, 1950;
Rumyantsev, 1967; Pushnikova and Rybnikova, 1991).
Some authors have studied the population
structure and tried to separate populations into groups using a number of ecological features.
Frolov
(1964) concluded from morphological characters that there are two groups of herring in Sakhalin
waters; marine (Sakhalin-Hokkaido) and lake. Rumyantsev (1967) studied herring scale structure
and
came to conclusion that there are ocean, marine and lagoon groups. Other
researchers (Sokolov, 1962;
Drujinin, 1963) denied the existence of any groups of herring other than the Sakhalin-Hokkaido.
Japanese researchers suggest two groups, oceanic and local herring and to separate local herring
into
lake and neritic herring (Iizuka and Morita, 1991).
This paper examines data on herring, inhabiting the southwest Okhotsk Sea along the Sakhalin
coast and the Tatar Strait.
Analysis of morphometric, biological and biochemical parameters suggest
the presence of herring populations in the area of Sakhalin-Hokkaido, Terpeniya bay, Aniva bay,
Sakhalin bay, Northeast Sakhalin coast bays, De-Kustry bay, Tunaycha lake, Nevskoye lake and
Ainskoye lake (Pushnikova et al., 1987; Rybnikova, 1987; Zverkova et al., 1991). The data indicate
that Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring differ from others by the greatest number of parameters and the
stock
occupies the largest area.
Lake populations are characterized by the smallest number of parameters
and smallest occupied area.
The two groups differ from each other by the rate of growth, sex
maturity, fecundity, location in waters of a different hydrochemical structure.
Fish of other
populations had intermediate biological and ecological parameters.
Thus, biological and ecological
parameters allowed the separation of the population into oceanic, local and lake.
The largest annual catch from the oceanic herring was one million tons, local populations 12
thousand tons and lake 200 tons (Table 1). Catches were reduced to 0.9, 0.08 and 0.001 thousand tons
when the stocks decreased.
The maximum age of the different groups of herring are: oceanic 18, local 11 and lake 9. The
longest body length is: oceanic 44 cm, local 32 cm and lake 29 cm.
Recently, the abundance of the
oceanic herring (largest stock) has been greatly depressed and the maturity age of all herring groups
has been reduced to 2.
Oceanic herring usually mature at 4, local at 3 and lake at 2 when the stocks
are not depressed (Table 2).
Lake herring have the lowest rate of growth rate of all the groups(Fig. 1). The body length of
1 year olds was: lake 8 cm, local 10 cm, oceanic a little more than 12 cm. The maximum difference
of body length at age 1 was 4 cm between oceanic and lake herring. This difference reaches 7cm at
4-
years old and 10 cm at 8. For example, data on Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring (oceanic), on De-Kastry
herring (local) and Tunaycha Lake herring (lake) are presented in Fig. 1.
378
Eighty percent of the lake group herring mature by 13.0
cm and mature local and oceanic
groups of herring appear in small numbers by 19 cm when all the lake group was already mature (Fig.
2). Eighty percent of the local group is mature by 20
cm and 80% of the oceanic by 24 cm. The body
length increased by 6 cm from the beginning to 100% maturity for lake and local herring but oceanic
did not fully mature for 8 cm. The maturity rate of oceanic herring is slow in comparison with other
groups. The slow rate of oceanic herring maturity compared to the other groups is, evidentely,
an
illustration of the deep intrastructure transformations that has happened in the Sakhalin-Hokkaido
herring over the 40 year depressed period.
Fecundity data were different between the three herring groups. The average number of eggs
of 19-25 cm lake group females was the highest
among individuals this size group(Fig. 3). Further,
with increasing of body length and fecundity of the
same size groups of oceanic herring grows at a
great rate, practically along the straight line at
an angle about 60° to absciss axis. At the same time,
the increase in the rate of lake herring fecundity is lower. When body length reaches 28
cm and more
lake herring has the lowest number of
eggs per female. The greatest fecundity oceanic herring is
more, than 120 thousands eggs (body length
- 35 cm), for local a little more than 60 thousands eggs
(body length - 31 cm) and for lake herring less than 50 thousands
eggs (body length - 29 cm).
The number of eggs per oceanic female is higher at all ages compared to local and lake herring
(Fig. 4). Fecundity of local herring at 2
years old (the beginning of maturity for this groups) is lower
compared to the lake group (2 years old is the
age of greatest maturity). Further fecundity of the same
age group of local herring increases and during the period of ontogenesis exceeds the index values of
the lake herring.
The winter and spawning conditions of herring greatly differs
among the three groups.
Oceanic and local groups over winter in the
open sea near the slope and slope areas, at 150-300 m
depth. Lake herring over winter in
lakes where the salinity does not exceed 12%o. Oceanic herring
spawning takes place in open littoral areas, at depths of 1.0-10.0
m, mainly, on sea plants and brown
algae. Salinity on the spawning grounds changes from 24.8 to 33.7%o. Local herring spawning occurs
on open littoral areas, in bays, creeks and lagoons at depths of 0.5-4.0 m on sea grass, brown and red
algae. Water salinity on the spawning grounds varies from 9.9
to 33.2%o. Lake herring spawn at sea,
in low salinity which vary from 9.0 to 21.4%o in the immediate neighbourhood of channels mouths
joining lakes in the sea at depths of 1.0-2.0
m on sea grass and brown algae.
The oceanic group of herring inhabit the North Japan Sea, south and middle parts of the
Okhotsk Sea and Pacific waters adjoining the South Kuril Island and Hokkaido
at different stages of
ontogenesis (Rumyantsev and Frolov et al., 1958). Local herring did not make extensive migrations as
the Sakhalin-Hokkaido group but remain in De-Kastry, Aniva bays, Terpeniya, Sakhalin and bays
and
lagoons of the northeast coast of Sakhalin (Nabil, Nyivo, Chaivo, Piltun).
Lake herring did not make
extensive migrations and differ from other
groups by feeding in open sea areas and returning to lakes
in the winter. Herring populations of lakes Tunaycha, Nevskoye, Ainskoye
form the lake groups.

Present State of the Okhotsk Herring Stock and Fisheries Outlook
Vladimir I. RADCHENKO and Igor I. GLEBOV

Center (TINRO-Center), Vladivostok, 690600,
Russia
Pacific herring was one of major fisheries developed during the initial period of the Russian
marine fisheries in the Far-East in the early 1950s. The Sea of Okhotsk the herring fishery has been
based on two large stocks: Okhotsk and Gizhiginsky-Kamchatkan. Catch of Gizhiginsky-Kamchatkan
herring quickly increased to the highest possible level and has sharply decreased since
1960s. The
Okhotsk herring were the subject of large scale fisheries until the second half of the 1970s. By 1963
the annual catch by Soviet fishermen was in excess of 200 thousand tones and by 1968-1969 reached a
peak of 417.9-424.4 th. t. The combined Russian and foreign catch was about 600 th. t.
During this
period, herring contribute 42.7-45.0% of fish production caught by the USSR in the Sea of Okhotsk
(Shuntov, 1985).
The development of a large scale herring fishery stimulated the formation of the
national
marine fishing fleet in the Far-East.
Historically, it has played an important role in Russian fisheries
management strategy in the Pacific Basin.
Planned increases in fish catch, resulted in the decline of
herring stocks as well as for other traditional species (salmon, flounders, etc.) caught in the coastal
areas and shelf, which caused a movement to fish walleye pollock. The presence
of a powerful fishing
fleet resulted in a shift of fishing efforts to the resources of the continental slope and offshore waters.
This strategy was caused by an additional stimulus with the introduction of the 200-miles economic
zone by most countries of Pacific region in 1978.
In the mid 1980s, the walleye pollock became the
most important fishery in Russian and in the world (Gershanovich et al., 1990).
An analysis of the stock dynamics of herring and walleye pollock, the two most abundant fish
species of Far-Eastern Seas pelagic zone, reveals that an increase in abundance of one coincides with a
decrease in abundance in the other (Shuntov, 1986, 1991;
Naumenko et al., 1990). By the early
1990s, North Pacific walleye pollock biomass decreased, particularly, in the northern area from 20-25
to 6 m1n. tons in the Bering Sea pelagic zone and from 14 to 5 min. tons in the North Sea of
Okhotsk.
The cause of this significant decrease was periodic global climatic oceanographic change in the pelagic
ecosystems of the Far-Eastern Seas, as well as, a corresponding change in the structure
of the
hydrobiont communities and the number of dominant fish species (Shuntov et al., 1993).
The majority of the herring populations throughout the Pacific region increased in abundance
from the early 1990s. There is evidence of increases in herring stocks inhabiting the Gulf of Alaska
and waters of British Columbia (Collie, Spencer, 1993; Schweigert et al., 1993). Data from a survey
of the Korfa-Karaginsky herring stock in 1993, in the west Bering Sea, indicates
a increase of about
two times compared to the second half of the 1980s.
Analysis indicate 286 thousand tons of herring
occur within the shelf at depths more than 50 in. and 120 min. fingerlings were
found in the
Karaginsky Bay. If in 1986-1987 the ratios of the numbers of walleye pollock to herring fingerlings
were from 100:1 to 25:1 then in December 1993 it was 2:1.
Data collected in fall of 1994 indicates
that the ichthyofauna in the eastern Olyutorsky Bay was predominantly small herring (fork length 13.6-
27.0 cm), about 37% of the estimated fish biomass while the walleye pollock was 29%.
384
From data collected in the eastern Bering
Sea groundfish surveys, the estimated herring by-
catch in 1988 as compared with that in the
early 1980s increases by three times (Bakkala 1993). These
data are mainly related to the herring from
the Bristol Bay sub-population being about 80% of total
numbers in the eastern Bering Sea. Some indirect
data also provides evidences of the growth of this
stock.
In July 1992, a large group of herring (modal
group of 32-33 cm) arrived in the Russian
economic zone north of 58°N. The walleye
pollock fishing fleet caught up to 60 tones per hour of
which the catches sometimes contain
up to 60% herring as by-catch. The herring are also distributed
in open waters of the Aleutian Basin
up to 100 miles off the shelf.
In the fall of 1994, a similar large
mass of herring was found by the r/v "Shursha" in Anadyr Bay.
In the 1980s, the abundance and
migration pattern of the East Bering Sea herring
is less pronounced and the distribution is limited to
the northern shelf.
The abundance in the western Bering Sea did
not exceed 35 min. fish and the
biomass was 8 th. tons or 2.5-3.0% of Korfa-Karaginsky
herring.
Assessments of the Okhotsk herring
stock were accepted until recently. The results of
epipelagic ecosystem studies in the Sea of
Okhotsk in 1984-1990 indicate a biomass in the order of 1
min. tons (Shuntov et al., 1993) and herring
are concentrated on the northern shelf. A recent
assessment by scientists from the Magadan Branch
of TINRO recommends a catch of 100 th. tons for
the Okhotsk herring (Yolkin, 1988). In the
early 1990s, there was an expansion of the feeding
area of
the Okhotsk herring to the south of West Kamchatka
and north of Sakhalin. In November-December
of 1993, herring biomass is estimated
at 2.5 min. tons by the volume method from a trawl
macro-
survey by the r/v "Professor Kaganovsky". However, the location
of the survey area and the density of
echo-records and catches (which is characteristic
of hibernating herring) provides grounds for doubt of
the estimation.
In March-April of 1994, the trawler "Novokotovsk"(
a small area 1.34 thousand sq.
km) caught 45-160 tons (average for 24
trawls was 11.8 tons per hour) while surveying for walleye
pollock. The average density of herring
within the grounds is estimated to be 66.8 tones
per sq.km
and the biomass about 90 thousand
tons.
The boundary of herring concentrations is to the south,
where herring is not found south of 57°N
and to the southeast where catches are 2 tones per hour in
TINRO Basin.
In August 1994, when dispersed herring
are feeding in the North Okhotsk Sea the r/v
"Professor Levanidov" operating mainly
to the south of 54°N caught up to 10 tones per hour to the
northeast of Sakhalin, in
an area where, in the 1970s-1980s, feeding herring
was not typical (Yolkin,
1988).
The most complete information
on the stock status, age composition and distribution of
Okhotsk herring during active feeding migrations
was collected from 498 thousand sq. km including 57
stations during a 25 day cruise of the r/v "TINRO"
in September-October of 1994. A comprehensive
survey of oceanographic conditions and the distribution of plankton,
fish and squids was conducted.
At each deep-water station, surface trawls
and stepped trawls within a layer of 50-280 m were carried
out using a rope trawl RT 108/528 equipped with
a fine mesh cod end of 6 to 30 mm. On the outer
shelf (depths more than 100 m)
one half hour trawls were carried out in the surface layer and in the
layer of echo-recordings.
Only surface trawls were carried out
over the shallow shelf. The average
fish density was quite high at 12.7
tones / sq. km (Table 1).
More than 95% of the biomass is from
three species;
walleye pollock (52.7%), herring (36.0%)
and northern smooth-tongue (8.2%).
A
pronounced reduction of the walleye pollock
occurs from 75.0-84.3% of the biomass in the latter half
of 1980s and an increase of the herring
is found from 3.5-9.7% (Shuntov et al., 1993). The herring
biomass is greater than that of other fish
species within the 0-50 m depth zone as well
as in the coastal
zone (Table 1).
Herring were quite widely distributed in
the North Sea of Okhotsk during the survey;
80.7% of 53 trawls on 46 stations
contained herring. The major concentrations of herring
occurs in
the shelf zone of the northern part of the investigated
area (Fig. 1). 99.3% of the herring biomass was
concentrated in regions Nos. 1, 2 and
5 including 60.1 % in Tauisky where the fishing fleet
caught
herring located to the south of the
mouth of Tauisky inlet.
The density was 92 tones per sq. km,
on
385
average, in an area of 4.3 sq. km. The catch from that station was 52.5 tones of 24-32 cm in length.
In region Nos. 6 and 7 the herring were dispersed (echo-records) and catches were not more than 90
kg per hour.
Size composition of herring varies insignificantly in the different areas. The 25-28 cm length
group predominate: 62.4 - 94.3% of total numbers in the regions which average 85.2% over all. The
modal length class is 27 cm: 28.3-53.7% which average 52.1% (Table 2).
The average length of
herring varies insignificantly from 26.2 to 26.8 cm with mean 26.7 cm. The Gizhiginsky- Kamchatkan
herring are longer, 35 cm versus 33 cm for Okhotsk herring. The portion of fish greater than 28 cm is
18.3% in the Shelikhov Bay and 11.8% in the Tauisky region. The proportion of small herring in the
Shelikhov Bay is more than in the Tauisky region: 13.4 % versus 0.4% for fish length less than 24
cm. The feeding grounds for fingerlings and maturing Okhotsk herring is in the Ayan-Shantar area
and Sakhalin Bay.
Herring fingerlings were also caught in trawls in Gizhiginsk Inlet (up to 10.8 kg per hour) and
at the coastal stations from Tolstoi Cape to Alevin Cape (single specimens). The length varies from
7.5-10 cm (some specimens reach 12 cm) with mean 8.74 cm (weight was 5.8 g) in large catches.
In
small catches the fingerlings vary from 5 to 7.3 cm. The low level of fingerlings in the Tauisky region
may have been caused by commercial fishing which may have caused the biomass and numbers of
herring fingerlings to be underestimated; 16.7 min. for the Okhotsk stock and 0.2 min. for
Gizhiginsky-Kamchatkan. The herring biomass is calculated both by the areal method and from echo-
records. Similar estimations have been obtained;
approximately 1.9-2.0 min. tons for Okhotsk and
0.27- 0.30 m1n. tons for Gizhiginsky-Kamchatkan.
Based on the estimates of mature Okhotsk herring biomass, it is recommended that the quota
could be increased during the herring feeding period because in early October, in the area of dense
echo-records (55.2 thousand sq. km), a biomass of 715 thousand tons was estimated which would
allow a fishery of 200 thousand tons without damage to the stock. A part of the herring stock is
dispersed and another part is outside the range of the survey in a third (Okhotsk-Lisyansk) region
serving as a "reserve". Based on the Okhotsk herring maturing by 5 years old, the age composition of
the catch (Table 3) shows the spawning stock of about 1.5 min. tons.
Herring spawning usually occurs in the coastal bays and inlets. The spawning success sharply
decreases with a high density of spawners as was evidenced by the low hatching rate of larvae at high
spawning density. Tyurnin (1980), concludes that a stock over 1 min. tons requires more extensive
use of available resources.
Based on data available, the recommended catch, in 1994, was increased to 120 th. tons for the
Okhotsk herring stock. However, in the late October, due to the low levels of catch, an unrestricted
(including trawling) fishery for herring was permitted by the "Glavrybvod" (Department of fish stocks
conservation of Russian Ministry of Fisheries). Unfortunately, the weather over the North Sea of
Okhotsk is extremely bad in December which prevented fishing.
Forecasting the Okhotsk herring catches for 1995 and subsequent years is under discussion due
to data from air flights on herring spawning grounds which was not provided in a timely manner. The
estimated spawning biomass of herring in the late spring early summer of 1994 is 700 thousand tons
which implies a low level of stock exploitation (10% level). About 70% of the mature herring
abundance is from the 1988 yearclass which spawned for the first time in 1994. From marine survey
data (Table 1) the 1989 yearclass will spawn at age 6+ in 1995 and their portion was 61.5% in the fall
of 1994 with biomass of 980-1030 th. tons. The biomass of the 1988 yearclass (28.4% of the
abundance) is estimated at 530-560 th. tons. Thus, a large part of the spawning stock of the Okhotsk
herring is not accounted for on the spawning grounds in 1994.
386
High density of Okhotsk herring during the feeding and hibernation periods is determined by
the appearance of two abundant cohorts that
are smaller in length and weight at age than other year-
classes. The average length of the herring spawners at the
ages of 5+, 6+ and 7+ are 266, 277 and
287 mm respectively (Yolkin 1988). Samples of herring going to hibernate in the winter at five, six
and seven are 254, 264 and 273 mm long, respectively.
The fork length of 8+ herring, on the
average, is 306 mm, close to the long-term average of 303 mm. A small numbers of fish 8+ could
imply an increase in the rates of natural mortality of elder age groups due to density dependent factors.
Similarly, a reduction in fecundity of Okhotsk herring (average number of
eggs spawned by one
female) might also be caused by density dependent factors (personal communication R.K.
Farkhutdinov).
Another indication of the considerable growth of herring is the massive occurrence of adults in
late October in the vicinity of the TINRO Basin and Kashevarov Bank. Yolkin (1988) observed that
herring migrate to the North Sea of Okhotsk shelf by the middle of September. The expansion of
populations of herring causes an expansion of the inhabited area boundaries for the period of high
abundance (Timofeyev-Resovsky et al., 1973). The resources (space, food) of neighboring habitat
(including open ocean) which are chiefly used by walleye pollock in 1980s, are an immediate reserve.
In the most cases, an expansion of herring towards
open waters occurs at the expense of feeding
migrations of mature fish (Blaber 1991).
Detailed discussions of results obtained from
a cruise in 1993-1994 allows the doubling of the
Okhotsk herring catch for 1996 to 120 th. tons. One can understand the reasons for caution when
reminded of the sharp reduction of the Okhotsk herring abundance in the second half of 1970s which is
thought to be caused by over harvesting and non-registered catches from the driftnet fishery. At the
same
time, recent studies show that a natural decline of herring abundance caused by global climate
change and oceanic conditions occurs during the
same period (Shuntov, 1991; Radchenko, 1994).
The increase in Okhotsk herring abundance, in the early 1990s,
appears to have been the result of a
shift in conditions from what is expected in the long-term. It should also be considered that, unlike the
usual gradual abundance increases, declines from high levels are usually abrupt. Evidently, it is
determined by the sharp increase of natural mortality rates for productive generations after approaching
of the limiting age.
The sustainable exploitation of marine biological
resources provides for the removal of excess
production. The actions should be even
more promptly taken to remove surplus biomass which could
cause the degradation of feeding and spawning conditions and density-dependent and intraspecific
mechanisms leading to population productivity reductions, late maturation and low viability of
embryos, larvae, etc.
The Okhotsk herring quota should be increased for 1995. In 1996-1997 a
change from a conservative approach of setting catch limits to a more pragmatic approach would
annually allow a harvest of not less than 200 thousand tons of Okhotsk herring.

Near the Coasts of Primorye (Sea of Japan)

INTRODUCTION
Balanus rostratus eurostratus
Bronch occurs subtidally near the Sakhalin coasts of the Sea of
Japan not farther north than 50°N and near the Japanese coasts (Tarasov and Zevina, 1957). This
species is long-lived and one of the largest barnacles. It can form a large biomass on a small base. It
inhabits stones, boulders, rocks as well as the shells of mollusks including commercially important
species (Ovsyannikova, 1989; Silina and Ovsyannikova, 1995). This species is often found to foul the
water intakes of hydro-technical construction (Gorin, 1975; Brykov et at., 1980), but it never settles
in a ship bilge (Tarasov and Zevina, 1957). Barnacle larvae are generally food for fish and adult
individuals for invertebrates and birds.
The data on the biology and distribution of B. rostratus
eurostratus are extremely scanty and fragmentary.
The purpose of this study was to analyze the data (about 90% of total), including data from the
literature, on the distribution of the species near the coasts of Primorye on the substrate (bottom and
hydro-technical construction), attached to organisms and to the mobile Japanese scallop Mizuhopecten
yessoensis
to study the occurrence of species in terms of the time spent in an area with increasing
anthropogenic pollution.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study of the distribution of the B. rostratus eurostratus was conducted from 1973 to 1995
near the south coast of Primorye (from the west coast of Possjet Bay and Furugelm Island to Nakhodka
Bay) and northeast of Povorotny Cape to Vladimir Bay. Barnacles were sampled by scuba divers at a
depth of 0-40 m (most often at 0-20 m).
Measurements of the carinorostrum diameter of the shell base and the shell height by the carina
plate for adult individuals were done using
a slide gage. Juveniles were measured under a binocular
microscope. The weight of concretions (druses) and individuals
were determined.
RESULTS
In the northwest part of the Sea of Japan, B. rostratus eurostratus is found only in Peter the
Great Bay (Table 1). North of Povorotny Cape, recognized
as a boundary between the north and west
Japan Sea districts of the Manchuria biogeographic province, is devoid of this species (Table 2).
Similarly, the species is not found west of Povorotny Cape in the
open part of Peter the Great Bay
where there are strong currents and a small amount of organic detritus on the bottom(Table 2). The
barnacle is not found to foul vessels. B. rostratus eurostratus most often occurs in protected and semi-
391
protected bays, near capes of bays or near islands where currents or wave action is significant.
It was
found that the barnacle attaches to the grotto walls or in the shade of large boulders and rocks.
B. rostratus eurostratus is generally found in concretions consisting of several barnacle
generations along with the mussel Crenomytilus grayanus, and Modiolus kurilensis.
The oyster
Crassostria gigas inhabiting Possjet, Amur, and Ussuri bays also occurs in the concretions.
Such
concretions are generally attached to boulders, rocks and at the base of stones and mollusc shells on
muddy and sandy bottom. A concretion found in Vostok Bay of B. rostratus eurostratus weight 1,232
g. The concretions with mussels and oysters found in the vicinity of Peschany Cape in
Amur Bay are
75 cm in diameter and weigh about 5 kg. In addition to natural substrates, B. rostratus eurostratus
colonizes objects, such as buoys, barrels, anchor chains, piers, rubber, glass and on cultured mollusk
shells. The barnacle usually appears on buoys in the first month of life.
In Possjet Bay, B. rostratus
eurostratus together with other organisms form a biomass fouling hydro-technical constructions .
For
instance in Vityaz Bay up to 65 kg per meter of which 21 kg is B. rostratus eurostratus are found
fouling anchor chains. The mass of single individuals did not generally exceed 85 g. The shell base is
no more than 65 g and the carina height did not exceed 65 mm.
The greatest biomass of B. rostratus eurostratus occurs in areas where domestic and industrial
sewage is discharged, i.e., in areas with high organic material.
Significant changes in the timing of
settlement is observed in these areas. In Amur Bay, near the city of Vladivostok, with a million
population, pollution is increasing and substantial changes have occurred to B. rostratus eurostratus
and to the Japanese scallop. In 1982, only few individuals of B. rostratus eurostratus are encountered,
whereas, by 1987 this species is dominant, having a biomass of up to 550 g and up to 180 specimens
per scallop shell. After flourishing since 1990, B. rostratus eurostratus has declined.
It should be
noted that in the more open parts of Amur and Possjet bays, there is a gradual tendency for the bottom
to become increasingly muddy.
Under these conditions there is an increase in occurrence of B.
rostratus eurostratus settling on Japanese scallop. On muddy bottom, the shell changed to
lily-shaped
and it grows higher and sometimes its carina reaches a height of 76 mm and the shell base is 48 mm.
DISCUSSION
This study confirms the presence of a boundary where there is a noticeable change of species
composition in the area of Povorotny Cape. These findings do not agree with the suggestions made for
bryozoans (Kubanin, 1981) and polychaetes (Bagaveeva, 1988) that the boundary lies farther north in
the area of Sokolovskay Bay. North of Povorotny Cape the influence of the cold Primorskoe Current
(from the northern part of the Sea of Japan) on the presents of the species is considerable.
In the
innermost parts of unprotected bays, the water temperature increases to over 17-18°C for a short time
to allow spawning of B. rostratus eurostratus to take place (Korn, 1985).
Evidently, the need for a
fairly high temperature, for reproduction, prevents it from existing farther north.
B. rostratus eurostratus forms large concretions on its own, on bivalve mollusks and on
barnacles and serves to provide a refuge for other organisms.
Seaweeds, bryozoans, hydroids, sea
anemones, juvenile mollusks, other barnacle species and tubeworms attach
themselves to the
concretions. Between the "branches" of the concretions, polychaetes, various crustaceans, and
nemertini are found. This increases the bioproductivity of polluted areas and enhances food for fish
species. Barnacles and bivalves, being sestono-feeders favor clean water.
At the same time, these
aggregations can cause problems for mariculture installations and hydro-technical construction.

Dependence of Urchin Strongylocentrotus Intermedius Reproduction
on Water Temperature
Galina I. VICTOROVSKAYA
Pacific Research Fishery Centre (TINRO)
4 Shevchenko Alley, Vladivostok, 690600 Russia
The sexual development and growth rate of urchins is, in many respects, determined by their
environment and ecological factors. Temperature plays one of the most important roles in the complex
of ecological factors regulating sexual activity of invertebrates (Korringa,1957;
Milyakovsky, 1970;
Kaufman, 1976; Wilson and Simons, 1985; Maru, 1985; Kasyanov, 1991; Hotimchenko, 1993).
Reproduction responds to daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations and salinity is not considered as
important (Mori, 1975; Yakovlev, 1976; Milyakovsky, 1981; Fretwel, 1987; Motavkine et al.,
1990).
The purpose of work was to study the influence of the temperature on the reproductive process
of gray urchins Strongylocentus intermedius inhabiting the coast of north Primorya (from Cape Gold to
Cape Belkina).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The object of the research was to collect samples by diving for gray urchins in their habitat
from Cape Gold to Cape Belkina. The reproductive process is studied throughout the spring-summer-
autumn during 1992-1993. The influence of temperature on gonad development is investigated using
histology examination to determine the stage of ripeness and to compare this to a gonad index. The
samples are fixed using 10% neutral formalin, filling with melted paraffin and 5 microns slides are
prepared for viewing by washing with hematoxilin Arlih and aozin.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Research of gray urchins gametogenesis inhabiting the coast of north Primorye indicate that
water temperature is an important influence on the reproductive process, especial, in the formation
eggs.
Growth and development of gametes is influenced by two time periods:
the autumn when
temperature of the water decreases and the spring when the temperature increases.
The most active
growth of gametes is observed at low positive but constantly rising temperature. During the winter,
the low negative temperature prevents duplication and the main mass of sexual cells is reabsorbed.
Active growth of sexual cells is observed when the water begins to increase at the end of April
beginning of May from Cape Gold to Cape Belkina (Fig. 1). Temperature of water did not exceed 1.5-
2.5°C and the gonadal index values are from 1% up to 7-10% where cells are observed in the early
stages of growth, "active gametogenesis" and "before spawing".
Spawing males and females first
appear in the region at the beginning of June. With increases in the temperature of water, the growth
of sexual cells becomes more active. The most intensive growth is observed when the temperature of
396
the water is 4-8°C which is observed at northern sites from the end of May to the end of June. In this
period, spawning females appear from the end of June to the beginning of July. The percent of the
ripeness increases
to 20. Spawning of the urchins, from Cape Gold to Cape Belkin, are from mid-July
to mid-August. The maximum temperature during reproduction is 12-16°C. After spawning the eggs
that remain in the gonads are reabsorbed and a 1.5 month period "of relative rest" occurs in which
gonad physiological reorganization took place.
When temperature decreases in the second half of
September a new reproductive cycle begins with active growth of gametes. In autumn, different stages
of reproductive growth of gametes is observed where the gonad index is from 1-10% and the
percentage with ripe gonads reaches 60.
In December, the low water temperature (up to 0°C) slows
development of sexual cells.
Temperature of approximately 0°C is critical for development of the
gametes of gray urchins.
The development of invertebrate gonads depends on the water temperature and in particular the
variation of the temperature during development determines when spawning occurs (Kaufman, 1977;
Uki and Kikuchi, 1984).
The water temperature is summed over the active period of sexual cell
development. In the first phase of gametogenesis (autumn
- winter), the degree days are summarized
in intervals of 14. In the second phase, in the spring - summer, development of takes place from 0°C
to spawning temperatures. Temperatures lower than 0°C cause re-absorption of cells, thus, zero is the
critical temperature for gamete development.
In the first phase, development of sexual cells of grey
urchin requires 600-650 degree days (Fig. 2).
In the second phase the effective temperature in this
region increases development up to 800-850 degree days. In general, the development of sexual cells
takes about 1,400-1,450 degree days.
It is
necessary to emphasize that the sum of the effective temperature for development of sexual
cells is constant and annual fluctuations in the spawning
season depends on the seasonal changes of the
water temperature(Yakovlev, 1976;
Kasyanov, 1991). On northern plots, the peak spawning of
urchins is the end of July beginning of August. Growth of larvae and spat settling generally occurs at
a temperature of 15 - 18°C (Agatsuma et al., 1989; Kasyanov et al., 1983).
At northern sites, the
time to heat the water to the required temperature for urchin development to the larval stage
compresses the spawning season. The importance water temperature in the process of development of
sexual products is seen by the fact that urchins inhabiting
areas on shoals, where the seasonal
temperature rise occur earlier than at greater depths, spawn earlier (Milyakovsky, 1981; Kasyanov,
1991).
The dependence of urchin reproduction on other ecological factor and the external environment
is a problem for further research.

Feeding Habits of Pacific Salmon in the Sea of Okhotsk
and in the Pacific
Waters of the Kuril Islands in Summer 1993

PINK SALMON
Pink salmon feeding in the Sea of Okhotsk was investigated. One-2 species predominate
in the
food of pink salmon (Synkova, 1951; Andrievskaya, 1957;
Gorbatenko and Chuchukalo, 1989).
Euphausiids are the predominated food item in the diet of pink except for West
Kamchatka where
hyperiids are the most important item eaten.
Nekton proved to be a minor item and squid did not
exceed 2% of the total food weight.
Fish is also insignificant excepting near the Eastern Sakhalin,
where it composed about 50% of the total weight of food eaten.
The Sea of Okhotsk plankton differ from Bering Sea and northwest
Pacific by the high
abundance of Euphausiids (Volkov, 1986; Shuntov et al., 1993). Feeding studies
indicate that walleye
pollock feed, mainly, on Euphausiids in the Sea of Okhotsk and copepods
in Bering Sea. Similarly,
the share of Euphausiids in the diet of salmon increases in the Okhotsk
Sea, while the species
composition of stomach content is simple. It
is known, that many species of Euphausiids are
unavailable to salmon because they descend to 100 m in the daytime and at twilight
when most salmon
are feeding (Volkov, 1994). In the summer of 1993, in the
south Okhotsk Sea, common Euphausiids
Thysanoessa longipes stay in patches of large mature specimen (from echo
sounder tracings) in the
epipelagic layer (0-50 m) during daytime. These crustacea, the most abundant among
Euphausiids in
the macroplankton are the main food of pink salmon.
In 1994, in almost all areas the stomach fullness of pink salmon was
high. The species
composition of food varies more in the Pacific waters of the Kuril Islands than in
the Sea of Okhotsk.
The nekton share in the diet is appreciably higher and Myctophids are the
main item in the nekton,
while squids are insignificant (up to 8%).
Euphausiids predominate in the diet near the Kuril Islands and
T.longipes is the most numerous
in the diet in the Okhotsk Sea but both T.longipes and Euphausia pacifica
are abundant in the Pacific
waters. The former in ocean ward areas and the latter in the waters adjacent to
the Kuril Islands. A
similar situation is observed in the plankton. The common hyperiids species
Parathemisto pacjca is
dominant in the food of salmon in all areas surveyed.
The hyperiids are in the middle of the food
group organisms
but they are more common when stomach fullness was low. Fullness
by hyperrids is
higher (2.8-18.4%) among small fishes (40 -50 cm) and 3.0-7.6% for larger fish.
The proportion of pteropods in the diet of pink salmon
is similar
throughout the survey area.
The highest share (14.4-33.7%) is observed over the deep water area where
hyperiids are the most
abundant in the plankton. Although the biomass of
Limacina helicina is almost
equal to Clione
limacina, pink salmon prefer the former.
The Copepods Calanus cristatus,
C. plumchrus, Eucalanus bungii and Metridia pacifica
frequently occur but are insignificant in the stomachs, except for
C.cristatus
which is 2.4-10.8% of the
stomach contents.
400
In general stomach fullness is lower in the
ocean than in the Sea of Okhotsk.
CHUM SALMON
The composition and dominance of some species in the diet of chum are similar among all size
groups (30-70 cm). Stomach fullness decreases with increasing body length. The nekton is a minor
part of the food similar to pink salmon (Gorbatenko and Chuchukalo, 1989). Euphausiids
(T.longipes)
dominate in the diet of chum 59-78% and hyperiids constitute 15-30%.
Pteropods, hyperiids and
ctenophores are also present in increasing importance. C. plumchrus is significant
among the copepods
in the deep water zone.
In the Pacific waters of the Kuril Islands chum feeding is similar
to the west Bering Sea and
Pacific waters of Kamchatka.
Pteropods such as Clione and Limacina are dominant in the diet and
abundant in the plankton (6-13 and 5-12 mg/m3 respectively) but the biomass is lower in most of
Okhotsk Sea (0-6 mg/m3). The pteropods in the chum's diet is
an important part of the diet in summer
of 1992 although it is lower than in 1993 (20-47%). Euphausiids (T.longipes and E.pacfca) and
hyperiids (P.pacifica) are the second and third
most abundant items in the plankton. Ctenophores
(Beroe cucwnis) sometimes exceed 50% of the stomach
content wet weight. Jellyfish (mainly Aglanta
digitale)
also frequently occur but is insignificant in the total diet.
In general, the stomach fullness in the
ocean is lower than in Okhotsk Sea.
We estimate the daily rate of chum and pink feeding using fullness, the share of
empty and
little filled stomaches and the fresh food in the stomach
contents. Most pink had empty and half-empty
stomaches from 00 to 7-8 a.m., when the least fullness is observed. The share of
empty stomacher
began to decrease after 9 a.m. The most fresh food
occur from 1 p.m. to 00 o'clock. Chum salmon
has a similar but lower daily rate of feeding. A classic daily
rate of chum's feeding is established in
the Bering Sea, where pteropods are the main food.
COHO AND CHINOOK SALMON
Data on the feeding behavior of these two species
are sparse, so the average is calculated for
south Okhotsk Sea and Pacific waters of the Kuril Islands. In 1993 the length of fishes range from 50
to 70 cm. Coho fed, mainly, on nekton (77-84%) but fish and squids
are also found in fish from the
Pacific Ocean and only fish in coho from the Okhotsk Sea.
Euphausiids are also considerable (13-
27%), while hyperiids and pteropods
are scarce. Stomack fullness is high everywhere 146-181%.
Chinook salmon stomaches often had little food
or are empty. Nekton is the most common
food item 67-70% (mainly fish) in the
ocean and euphausiids, fish and squids are eaten in the Sea of
Okhotsk.
It is interesting to note that small chinook (less than 30 cm) only fed
on nekton in the Okhotsk
Sea in the fall-winter period and no plankton is
not found in their stomachs.
CONCLUSIONS
Owing to differences in the composition of plankton communities in
the Okhotsk Sea and
Pacific Ocean, some distinctive feeding behavior is observed in
salmon. Species composition in the
diet is similar for plankton but a diversity of other species
dominate. During migration in summer
(June-July) pink salmon actively feed
on nekton (juveniles, small fishes and squids) and large
401
zooplankton (euphausiids, pteropods).
Sometimes copepods are an appreciable (25-38%) amount
of
the food consumed. Euphausiids dominate in the pink diet in the Sea of Okhotsk,
while the nekton is
low. There is less euphausiids in the stomachs in Pacific waters of the Kuril Islands due to an
increase
of hyperiids and pteropods. Squids are insignificant in the total diet.
Chum feed, mainly, on euphausiids (T.longipes)
in the Sea of Okhotsk and pteropods,
hyperiids and nekton are a minor part of the food consumed (up to 25%). Pteropods,
ctenophores and
jelly-fishes dominate in the diet in Pacific waters, while euphausiids are a minor part of the
food items.
Coho (50-70 cm) feed, mainly, on nekton (fish and squid).
Chinook (50-70 cm) eat nekton
(fishes) in Pacific waters of the Kuril Islands and euphausiids in the Sea of Okhotsk.
Copepods are a minor part of the salmon diet and the abundant chaethognaths are
absent in the
salmon diet.

Okhotsk Sea Walleye Pollock Stock Status
Larisa M. ZVERKOVA, Georgy A. OKTYABRSKY
SakhNIRO, 196 Komsomolskaya st, Yuzhno - Sakhalinsk, 693016, Russia.
The stock status of the walleye pollock in the North Okhotsk Sea (to the north of 50°N) was
analyzed using commercial fishery statistics and production models. Modelling of the catch enabled
estimates of production parameters which were applied to concrete numerico-temporal conditions. The
objective of this paper is to extend the previous study by Zverkova and Oktyabrsky (1994) using a
longer time series and different assumptions. The time series and assumptions used in the previous
study yielded an upper limit of the walleye pollock fishery stock at 7.4 min. tons and the estimated
maximum sustainable yield was 1.7 min. tons for the optimum exploitation. The presented paper
contains fewer limiting conditions than the previous one but still retains some model stability problems
due to the short data time series.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The walleye pollock found in the North Okhotsk Sea is relatively isolated and a single resource
(Zverkova, 1993). The fishery has traditionally been conducted in the two regions. The first region is
located in the eastern part of the sea and bounded by East Kamchatka and the North Kurils. The
second region is located in the northwest part of the Okhotsk Sea and includes the area near Taui Inlet,
Shelikhov's Bay and the highseas part of the Okhotsk sea, where largescale uncontrolled international
fisheries are ongoing. Within the first region, fishing pressure has been a factor for approximately
twenty years. The second region fishery, which began in 1981, developed into a large scale fishery by
1983. The fishery statistics used to run the model are summarized for the whole region starting from
1981. The cumulative walleye pollock catch for both the North Okhotsk Sea and the two fishery
regions is shown in the Table 1.
The walleye fishery within the first region has always been more diversified than in the second
region. The fleet fishing within the first region is by small, medium and large tonnage vessels and in
the course of time the small vessels were replaced by more productive larger vessels as the medium
tonnage fleet was updated.
As these changes occurred, the walleye pollock resource became more
available to the fishing fleet and catches were more representative of the effort expended. The medium
tonnage fleet is used as a reference for the first region based on the significant impact they had on the
total harvest. A hypothetical medium tonnage vessel is used to represent the fleet, ranging in
characteristics from seiner-trawler to medium tonnage trawler. These vessel types proved to be the
most productive in terms of walleye pollock harvesting and their unit effort is comparable with that of
the large tonnage fleet. The walleye pollock fishery in the northern Okhotsk Sea has a seasonal cycle
of catch and catch rates starting in November-December and finishing in April-May. The temporal
distribution of catch per unit effort as corresponds to the efficiency of the fishery approximates a the
convex function. However, due to the poor quality of the data and the need to consolidate it within
one calendar year, it is assumed that the fishery efficiency is uniform during the fisheries season. For
those years where we do not have annual data, average catch per unit effort is taken as the geometrical
403
mean for those months where data is available excluding the
last month in the season. Fadeev and
Smirnov, (1994) data from sources other than ours are used based on a uniform
distribution.
The fishing effort that best describe efficiency of the reference
medium tonnage vessel
operation is catch per vessel day in the first region (Table 1).
The standartization of the effort for a
long time period would be a difficult task to solve, so it is assumed to be
taken by the vessels of the
seiner trawler and meduim tonnage trawler types.
The walleye pollock fishery in the second region is mainly by large
refrigerator trawlers.
Recently, the contribution of the medium tonnage fleet increased and
has become dominant in the
fishery.
The catch of this fleet is more representative than the cumulative ones
for the first region.
The 1985-1992 time-series of the catch per unit effort for the second
region is constructed based
mainly on data taken from Programs ..., (1989).
These data contain catch per unit effort obtained
from the Russian large tonnage fleet in terms of tons per vessel day for the
fishery. A hypothetical
average vessel is developed combining the features of the
large refrigerator and large autonomous
freezer trawler types as a reference for the second region using vessel day as a
unit of fishing effort.
Catch information from the high seas fishery is obtained partly from
Li (1994). Since 1991,
medium and large tonnage vessels have played a major role in the large-scale
walleye pollock fishery.
In 1991-1992, foreign vessels similar to the Russian large refrigerator
trawlers and large autonomous
refrigerator trawlers are used to calculate the averaged catch per unit effort.
In 1994, due to the lack
of data, the fishing efficiency in the high seas is assumed to be similar to
that attained for the Russian
large tonnage fleet in the second region. It is assumed that the whole
catch was taken by the vessels of
the reference type.
Catch per unit effort by vessels of the reference type
of vessel is shown in the
Table 1.
Based on the assumptions for the walleye pollock fisheries in the two
regions, a hypothetical
fishing effort can be expressed as: fi = Yi/ Yf,i where i denotes
the fishing regions. After
summarizing the data for each region, the standartization is performed by the two
methods:
v1 v2
1/2 1/2
a) Yf, st = Yf, l x Yf,2 and
b) Yf, st = Yf, l x Yf,2 .
Where V1 and V2 are the mean values of the statistical weights
for the fishing effort made by
the reference vessels for the first and second regions, respectively.
Expression "b" the geometrical
means are given.
The aim of the study is to select a Production Model that would
yield the best fit for the data
series available. The models selected are Shaefer's model in linear
Yf = Yf(fe), and least square Ye
= Ye (f, f2), and Ye = Ye (Yf, Y2f) versions and the
generalised Fox model in two versions: Yf =
Yf(fn) and Ye = Ye(f,fm).
Estimated values are calculated using least square
method, an
approximation method by Kramer and the Shaefer method. The calculations are
carried out using two
software packages PROD (5) and ME202AUR (6).
The process of calculation and their results
The standardized values of fishery efforts:
f = Y / Yf are calculated based on the sum
of
catches for the two fishery regions and the standardized walleye pollock
catches for the North Okhotsk
Sea.
Then the walleye pollock stock for the whole North Okhotsk Sea is
calculated using the
Production Models. Of the different modelling options the most acceptable
results are obtained with
V1 = V2 where catch per unit efforts and efforts are standardized
according to version "b" above
(Table i) using the Shaefer Production model.
404
The input was the time-series 1981-1994 using the differential model versions:
Ye,t = Bt x (1 - 0.1(6)Bt) min T.
Where Ye,t is the equilibrium catch;
Bt the average biomass of the fishery portion of the
walleye pollock stock for the year t; the maximum fishery biomass Bmax is taken as equal to 6 min.
tons, and instanteneous production increment rate (k) as 1 (year-1). Along with production
parameters, the catchability q = 2.06*10-5 (vessel day {for the vessel of MLT type}-1) is calculated.
Note that MLT means, a hypothetical vessel combining characteristics of both medium tonnage and
large tonnage fleet on a 50-50 basis. An equation of equlibrium state or working model of Shaefer
proper has the form:
Ye = 4.8X 104 Yf - 389 Yf2.
The equation yielded the following parameter values for the optimum exploitation: MSY
(maximum sustainable yield) Yopt = 1.5 min. tons, Yf, opt = 62 tons per vessel-day for MLT vessel
type, fopt = 24 thousand vessel days for MLT vessel. Using q, we obtain the instanteous fishing
mortality rate Fopt = 0.5 per year and the fish stock level Bopt= 3 min tons.
The actual catch and that is obtained by the model and the theoretical mean values for the
northern Okhotsk Sea walleye pollock stock for the period 1981-1994 are calculated by: Bi = Yi / Fi,
where i represents a particular year (Fig. 1). Since 1984, actual catches exceed the sustainable yield
and the stock has declined while catches for a number of years since have been near MSY with great
deviations from it recorded in 1988 and 1990. The stock is underexploited for 11 years, according to
Shaefer's model.
In 1992, due to the international fisheries, the actual exploitation rate greatly
exceeded MSY. The strength of the walleye pollock stock slightly exceeds the optimum level and
that's why the pressure of the international fishery, exerted in 1992, left it at, the optimum level.
During the last two years the stock has remained at the optimum level and the harvest has been
at the optimum exploitation. In view of this, it would be reasonable not to exceed the level of
cumulative catch obtained by the nations fishing in the northern Okhotsk Sea so as not to overexploit
the stock of walleye pollock and bring it below the optimum level.

Water Soluble Polysaccharides of some Far-Eastern Seaweeds

Seaweeds contain a large number of different polysaccharides that are of
interest to mankind.
These substances perform a broad spectrum of functions in seaweeds. They serve as energy resources,
take part in the formation of cell walls, of outer capsules and in the internal
matrix and cause selective
cation absorption. The water extracts obtained from seaweeds and polysaccharides
isolated from these
extracts were shown to possess immunomodulatory and anti-tumor
activities and to be able to bind
some heavy metals, etc. (Colwell, 1985).
These polysaccharides have enabled scientists to
develop
modern biotechnology tools and techniques (Reen, 1993). Although the results
of many studies ascribe
different physiological properties to these polysaccharides few can be found
in the literature and few, if
any, have ever reached commercial importance.
The abundant supply of algae and the large variety of their species make
it possible to exploit the
Russian Far-Eastern seas algae on an industrial scale.
The main regions for commercial seaweed
harvesting are the coasts of Primorye, Sakhalin Island and South Kurile
Islands (Kizevetter et al.,
1981).
Laminarans, fucoidans and alginic acids are the main polysaccharides of
brown seaweeds. Their
contents vary from 50 to 80% of alga dry weight. During seaweeds
processing, these valuable water-
soluble polysaccharides are waste despite the fact that they are widely used
in the food industry and in
medicine.
Term "laminaran" describes a group of the reserve, water-soluble 1-a3;
1->6-p-D-glucans with
low molecular mass isolated from seaweeds of Phaeophyta.
Laminarans from different sources are
well known to vary considerably in both content, and structure (Zvyagintseva et
al., 1994). The study
of 1, 3-(3-D-glucanases and their substrates 1-*3-(3-D-glucans are explained
by the direct participation
of these substances in animals and plant immunity.
Fucoidans are the sulfated polysaccharides composed mainly of a-l--*2 or
a-1-->3-linked L-
fucose residues and they can also contain residues of galactose, mannose, xylose,
and glucuronic acid.
Fucoidans are nontoxic polyelectrolytes. They can be used like alginic acids
for heavy metal binding
or, like dextran sulfate for HIV infection treatment (McClure et
al., 1992), etc.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the content and structure of
laminaran and fucoidan
collected from the most widely distributed Far-Eastern seaweeds: brown algae
Laminaria cichorioides,
L.gurjanovae, L.digitata, L japonica, Fucus evanescens,
and grass Zostera. Recently, a simple method
for separation and isolation of 1-*3;
1->6-(3-D-glucans and fucoidans was developed in our
laboratory.
It allows the isolation of laminarans from very dilute solutions and to
effectively separate
them from fucoidan. A sample from dry powdered alga fronds is
successively extracted with cold (t°
-20-25°C) and hot (t° -70-80°C) water and the resultant extracts are
separately subjected to
hydrophobic chromatography.
Structures of the laminarans and fucoidans isolated are studied
using
specific enzymes, and by means of gel-filtration,
IR-, mass- and 13C-n.m.r. spectroscopy, by
408
methylation analysis, and other standard methods of carbohydrate chemistry. The monosaccharide
contents of these glycans are determined by means of carbohydrate analyzer after the complete acid
hydrolysis.
The yield of polysaccharides from seaweeds appreciated concerning the dry weight of fatless
frond (Table 1). The laminaran content varies from species to species and depends on the season. The
greatest quantities accumulate in Laminaria cichorioides in the autumn.
The 13C-n.m.r spectra of polysaccharide fractions provide evidence of the presence of 1-+3; 1-p
6-(3-D-glucans in almost all except for the hot extract fraction from L.gurjanovae, representing a linear
1-*3-(3-D-glucan (Table 2). The signal in the substituted C-1 (around 103.0 p.p.m.) and C-3 (85.0-
87.0 p.p.m.) regions are complex for the majority of glucans and indicate their branched structures
(Table 2).
All glucan fractions are treated with exo-(1->3)-P-D-glucanase from Eulota maakii. This
enzyme produces D-glucose upon sequential hydrolysis of laminaran from the non-reducing end
circumventing the P-(1-46)-linkages as they appear at the terminal end and attacks the adjacent (3-(1-*
3)-linkages liberating gentiobiose. The molar ratio of gentiobiose to glucose estimated during
enzymatic hydrolysis reflects the degree and localization of the glucan branching. Enzymatic
hydrolysis products are analyzed by h.p.l.c. Besides the contents of 1,3-a- and 1,6-n-linked glucose
residues are determined by methylation analysis and by 13C-n.m.r. spectroscopy. The findings indicate
that laminarans from the alga studied differ considerably in the ratio of 1, 3-R-linked glucose residues
to 1, 6-p-ones (from 2:1 to 49:1) (Table 3).
The laminarans under study are also found to differ considerably in molecular mass reaching, in
some cases, the value of about 50 kDa (Table 3, laminarans isolated from Laminaria digitata and
Zostera).
All glucans under study are optically active and have negative rotation except for laminaran II
from Zostera (Table 3). The water solution rotates in the polarization plane to the right but the
solution in 0.05 M sodium hydroxide is optically inactive. This observation indicates that laminaran II
from Zostera probably has an ordered triple-helical structure in neutral solutions.
So, neutral polysaccharides from the brown alga examined aree mainly 1-*3; 1-*6-p-D-glucans
which differ considerably in the degree of branching, molecular-weight distribution, the value of
specific rotation, the availability to enzymatic hydrolysis.
All seaweeds studied also contained a considerable quantities of fucoidan (Table 1). Fucoidans
were the high sulfated heteropolysaccharides: IR-spectra showed characteristic absorption-peak at 842
cni 1. Their molecular masses varies in a wide range. IR- and 13C-n.m.r. spectra of fucoidans isolated
from different sources differed including their monosaccharide compositions (Tables 1 and 4). One of
the fucoidan fractions isolated from Fucus evanescens involved attention due to the following
peculiarities:
L-fucose content is diminished, but galactose content is raised; mannose is absent, but
the presence of unidentified monosaccharide X was noted.
Brown alga Laminaria cichorioides seems to be a rich source of laminaran, and Fucus
evanescens
contained the greatest quantity of fucoidans differing in their structures.

ABSTRACT
Data collected over 14 years from Posieta Bay are analyzed to determine the relationship
between the hydrometeorology and hydrobiological characters of scallops. The annual development
cycle of cultivated Japanese scallop Patinopecten yessoensis (Jay) is delineated. The average water and
air temperature, points of temperature transition over 0°C, sums of "heat" and variability of
temperature for each period and the duration of ice cover is evaluated to determine the statistical
significant predictors to provide schemes for increasing production.
INTRODUCTION
Climatology is used to explore the productivity of sea farms, in particular, scallop farms of
Primorye.
The intensive development of sea farming in the Primorye in recent years has created
conditions where it is becoming very important to determine the productivity of the farms.
To predict the long-term productivity of scallops, one must study the hydrology (water
temperature, salinity, ice cover, water mass stratification, and wave activity), meteorology (air
temperature, direction and speed of wind, precipitation, and sunshine) and solar activity (Wolf number)
effects on Japanese scallop and on the method of cultivation. The major aim of this study was evaluate
possible hydrometeorological predictors to forecast the long-term impact on sea farm scallop
productivity in the South Primorye.
This study is the first stage of our research. Mori (1975) produced the first paper on this topic
which was and
followed by studies of other scientists (Belogrudov and Skokleneva, 1983; Belogrudov,
1986; Kucheryavenko, 1986; Gabayev, 1987).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The area of the study was the Experimental Sea Base "Posieta" where bivalve mollusks have
been cultivating since 1970. Hydrometeorological Station (HMS) "Posieta" observations are used
from data that has been collected since 1931 (Fig. 1). All culture operations from the production of
spat to commercial production are performed in natural conditions. From 1970-74 scallop spat is
collected using shells and since 1975 a net consisting of an envelope and a filter is used. The net
consists of 10 sacs attached one to another (Belogrudov, 1986). The timing of spat release is
determined by the change in the gonadal index according to Ito et al. (1975). The sea surface water
temperature, at Posieta HMS, was measured 4 times a day, air temperature 8 times a day, using
standard procedures. The average daily temperature is used in the analysis. The duration of the ice
417
period is determined from the date of the first appearance of ice to the date
of complete disappearance.
The variability ratio is used to calculate water temperature as follows:
V=s*t-'*100% (1)
The sum of "heat" for different periods of scallop development represents the sum
of the daily
averaged water temperatures throughout the period of observations.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The analysis of data indicated that there are four annual development
periods for cultivating
scallops :
Period I - wintering(t,);
Period II - a stable water temperature transition over 0°C to
the beginning of spawning (t2);
Period III - plankton development (t3);
Period IV - beginning to full larvae settlement (t4).
The duration of Period I (days) agrees with the ice period. Periods II,
III and IV are calculated
using the average daily water temperature, the provision of heat or "heat" sum
and the coefficients of
variation (Table 1).
Correlation analysis indicates that scallop spat density is dependent on
the
following variables:
- duration of the ice period (t,, days );
- duration of Period II;
- heat sum for Period II;
- variability of water temperature
during spawning period (V, %).
The density is approximated by a linear regression (Table 2).
Scallop spat density and ice
period duration are the best correlates (inverse relationship) (Fig. 2). The
medium and high values of
spat density are recorded when spawning began but no earlier than
the 19-22 June in 1976, 1977, 1979
and 1983. The negative effect of the water temperature variability during
spawning on subsequent
scallop spat density is due to the lack of the larvae's ability to adapt to sharp
fluctuations. A rather
stable water temperature (Period III) with V = 5.49% corresponds to the most
productive year (1983).
It is one third to two times as great as in other years (Table 1).
CONCLUSION
The data indicate that the duration of ice
is the most significant hydrometeorological
parameter.
There is a linear dependency between the density of spat settlement
and the following
parameters:
the period from stable water temperature transition over 0°C to
the beginning of
settlement, the stability of water temperature during spawning, and the sum of
heat in the prespawning
period. In the future these parameters will be use to project spat density.
