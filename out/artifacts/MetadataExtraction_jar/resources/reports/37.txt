PICES Scientific Report No. 37 xi 
 
Executive Summary 
In October 2004, PICES Working Group on Ecosystem-based Management Science and its Application to the 
North Pacific (WG 19) was established, under the direction of the Marine Environmental Quality Committee 
(MEQ) and Fishery Science Committee (FIS), with the following terms of reference: 
1. Describe and implement a standard reporting format for Ecosystem-based Management (EBM) initiatives 
(including more than fishery management) in each PICES country, including a listing of the ecosystem 
based management objectives of each country. 
2. Describe relevant national marine ecosystem monitoring approaches and plans and types of models for 
predicting human and environmental influences on ecosystems. Identify key information gaps and research 
and implementation challenges.  
3. Evaluate the indicators from the 2004 Symposium on “Quantitative Ecosystem Indicators for Fisheries 
Management” for usefulness and application to the North Pacific. 
4. Review existing definitions of “ecoregions” and identify criteria that could be used for defining ecological 
boundaries relevant to PICES. 
5. Hold an inter-sessional workshop in Year 2 or 3 of the WG’s mandate that addresses the status and progress 
of EBM science efforts in the PICES region, with the deliverable being either a special journal issue or a 
review article. 
6. Recommend to PICES further issues and activities that address the achievement of EBM in the Pacific. 
 
The second term of reference above was never addressed, as it was later realized that no PICES country was 
advanced enough in EBM applications to be at the stage where it was monitoring and actively practicing EBM. 
 
This Working Group report builds on the earlier Study Group on Ecosystem-based Management Science and its 
Application to the North Pacific report (Jamieson and Zhang, 2005), which documented that:  
1. EBM challenges are different in China, Japan and Republic of Korea compared with Canada, Russia, and the 
United States because of differences in coastal population sizes and their different exploitation histories for 
most harvestable renewable resources. For the former three countries, EBM is, initially at least, focused on 
(a) minimizing existing impacts, (b) rebuilding depleted stocks to more acceptable levels, and (c) minimizing, 
in nearshore areas in particular, widespread impacts in the marine environment from land runoff from both 
industrial and urban developments.  In contrast, human coastal populations and urban development in the 
latter three countries were generally much less, with fishing impacts and offshore oil and gas development 
and transport identified as the major impacts. In many instances, relatively unaffected habitat and biological 
communities still exist, and so the challenges there are often how to maintain them while permitting 
appropriate new economic activities to occur; and  
2. While there are many human activity impacts on the marine environment (e.g., fishing, mariculture, oil and 
gas exploration and development, pollution from land-based activities, disruption of freshwater discharges by 
urbanization, etc.), a relative lack of comprehensive databases has meant that reporting of ecosystem impacts 
has mostly focused on documenting and addressing only fishery impacts. 
 
To date, management of human activities in the marine environment has been primarily sector-focused.  For 
instance, fisheries have targeted commercially important species, without explicit consideration of 
non-commercial species and broader ecosystem impacts.  There is an increasing international awareness of the 
cumulative impacts of sector-based activities on the ecosystem and the need to take a more holistic or EBM 
approach to ensure the sustainability of marine ecosystems.  In this report, we track progress toward developing 
ecosystem approaches by PICES member countries in the North Pacific.  The primary focus is on fisheries as one 
of the most common economically and socially beneficial uses of the North Pacific ecosystem. However, 
fisheries can be a significant driver of ecosystem change.  Still, as is discussed herein, there are many other 
activities of importance to countries in the North Pacific and these, too, are increasingly becoming part of the 
  
xii PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
forward looking evaluation of ecosystem approaches to management (EAM).  The diversity in approaches taken 
by the different PICES member countries is seen positively as experimenting with the concept of EAM/EBM 
consistent with each country’s experience and circumstances.  Through the process of documenting this 
diversity, it can be discerned about what works and does not work under particular circumstances.  We therefore, 
also look beyond fisheries applications and suggest what a fully integrated EAM might entail as a long-term goal 
of management. 
 
This report provides a summary of the emerging consensus on indicators of marine ecosystems, and makes 
recommendations applicable to North Pacific waters of PICES interest.  In addition, it attempts to take a broader 
view of indicators for EBM of marine systems rather than the narrower application to fisheries management 
(even though most research to date has focussed on this narrower application).  Specific recommendations 
relating to indicators include that PICES should:  
1. explore the use of a consensus suite of indicators in each of its regions to develop a common set of indicators 
to be included in each iteration of the PICES North Pacific Ecosystem Status Report;  
2. use the WG 19 Ocean Management Activity reports and FIS and MEQ committee inputs to help identify 
region-specific drivers of change and pressure measurements in order to interpret relevant status indicators;  
3. establish collaborations with social scientists to develop indicators which describe the coupled marine 
social-ecological system and expand the understanding of human behaviors and responses to 
environmental forcing from the marine sector; and  
4. recommend a research activity to explore the use of additional indicators for marine ecosystem-based 
management in each of its regions, building from those outlined here and elsewhere. 
 
Accounting for spatially explicit trends, processes and relationships is a main component of EBM, and so the 
identification of spatial characteristics and the relevant spatial scales of marine ecosystems is important to 
provide a context for identifying stakeholders, defining objectives, conducting research, and implementing 
policies focused on sustainable management of species, goods and services.  The Working Group found broad 
consistency in the criteria used to define and delineate marine ecosystems in the territories of PICES member 
countries, even though the member countries approached the issue in several different ways.  All PICES 
countries also acknowledged cases where ecosystems extend beyond their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), 
either into another nation’s EEZ or into international waters.  However, National Summaries contain less 
information about waters that lie beyond continental slopes and outside of their EEZs, even in cases where those 
waters are deemed part of the same ecosystem as (and are thus thought to be ecologically linked to) waters lying 
nearer to shore.  PICES member countries varied widely in the formality of their approaches and the extent of 
their progress with respect to ecosystem delineation and sub-regionalization.  Finally, at least two major 
challenges remain for formal delineation of ecosystems and subregions in the PICES area.  First, PICES member 
countries need to determine the priority of developing, defining and implementing a standardized template for 
ecosystem delineation.  This is relevant because many suggested ecoregions extend beyond national boundaries. 
Currently, such a template does not exist and its priority, both within individual nations and within PICES, 
remains unclear.  Second, the delineation schemes described above were largely prepared by fisheries ecologists 
and likely reflect biases inherent to this sector.  The limitations and consequences of those biases would need to 
be addressed, likely through inclusion of a broader number of disciplines.   
 
The PICES EBM topic sessions and workshops held in association with Annual Meetings in Vladivostok, Russia 
(2005, Session 8 on “Ecosystem indicators and models”); in Yokahama, Japan (2006, Workshop W3 on 
“Criteria relevant to the determination of unit eco-regions for ecosystem-based management in the PICES 
area”) and in Victoria, Canada  (2007  Worskhop W3 on “Comparative analysis of frameworks to develop an 
ecosystem-based approach to management and research needed for implementation”) made progress in 
highlighting the above issues with respect to implementation of EBM in PICES member countries.  From the 
presentations, especially at the 2007 workshop, it was clear that member countries are in different stages of 
implementation with respect to EBM.  Some countries are still working on incorporating an ecosystem approach 
to fisheries management while others have national legislation that provides a mechanism for implementing a 
cross-sectoral approach to the management of marine activities to ensure environmental protection.  The degree 
of advancement might be partly related to the nature of the different human pressures being exerted on the 
  
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 xiii 
marine environment.  Even some of the countries that appeared to be more advanced in their implementation 
mentioned problems in actually making cross-sectoral management work in marine ecosystems.  Particularly, 
the need for overarching legislation that requires action may be needed.  It was clear that more than one agency 
was involved in EBM activities in each country and a challenge is to get agencies to work together in 
implementation.  It was also noted that the main type of legislation in most nations that forced this cross-sectoral 
implementation was species-at-risk legislation. 
 
Data requirements for EBM were discussed to some extent.  The Australian experience demonstrated that 
implementation could involve both highly quantitative approaches and models if data are available but the 
framework could also include methods to evaluate ecosystem status and potential impacts even in qualitative 
ways.  The ICES experience demonstrated how highly evolved data gathering for EBM advice could be, 
although it was noted that highly evolved advice did not necessarily translate into the political will to follow such 
advice.  The PICES Technical Committee on Monitoring (MONITOR) outlined some of the data requirements 
that would require its involvement along with the involvement of all the PICES Committees.  The 2007 
workshop particularly noted the lack of socio-economic data to aid in decision-making in an EBM context.   
 
Analytical tools being developed to aid in EBM frameworks included the highly structured risk assessment 
framework of Australia that allows for both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of risks and defining when 
actions are needed.  The PICES MODEL Task Team described the suite of modeling tools that might be used to 
understand impacts of climate variability on marine ecosystems.  Models such as Atlantis, used in the evaluation 
of management strategies, seem to be important tools in EBM decision-making. 
 
Communicating results of EBM activities is ongoing in PICES member countries.  Some are using highly 
structured reporting instruments such as ecosystem assessment documents.  ICES advisory structure for 
communicating EBM advice in a tactical way is highly evolved although reporting its success in implementing 
EBM might not be so advanced.  Reporting of ecosystem status is important but it was also recognized that 
identification and reporting of ecosystem pressures and ecosystem responses to management are important 
pieces of communication of EBM progress.  Communicating measures of human health was noted as important 
in this regard.  The PICES role in communicating EBM was seen to be more of a strategic one.  There are a 
variety of potential scales useful in reporting results.   
 
A major outstanding research gap is the need for inclusion of social science indicators and information.  The 
advancement of risk assessment frameworks and tools also seemed particularly important. 
 
 
Looking Beyond WG 19 
 
We discussed how the findings and work of WG 19 could best be integrated and built upon within PICES in 
years ahead, particularly within the context of the new PICES integrative science program on Forecasting and 
Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems (FUTURE). 
Development of EBM is still very much in its early stages in each of the PICES member countries, and so we 
recommend that PICES continue to actively monitor progress into the foreseeable future.  To provide a 
long-term forum for this process, we concluded that the issues addressed by WG 19 might justify the 
establishment of a new group, with emphasis on developing an integrative, science-based, ecosystem-scale 
understanding of the human dimension (across a diversity of sectors).  This group will be closely associated with 
FUTURE’s Advisory Panel on Anthropogenic Influences in Coastal Ecosystems (AICE).  We suggest the new 
group be called “PICES Understanding, Linking and Synthesis of Ecosystems” (PULSE).  Below is a draft 
proposal on the objective, terms of reference and membership recommendations for PULSE: 
 
  
xiv PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
Objective 
 
To monitor and synthesize regional and basin-wide ecosystem-based management (EBM) studies and initiatives 
(ecosystem health) and to provide a forum for the integration of FUTURE-related EBM practices and their 
implementation.  
 
Draft Terms of Reference 
 
1. PULSE (PICES Understanding, Linking and Synthesis of Ecosystems) is the scientific body responsible for 
the promotion, coordination, integration and synthesis of research activities related to the implementation of 
EBM among PICES member nations.  This goal would be accomplished by convening meetings, periodic 
scientific symposia or workshops, and by distributing information designed to foster cooperation and 
integration among existing or developing PICES programs, and possibly between and/or within member 
nations. 
2. PULSE will provide the scientific body to identify and improve indicators to measure progress in the 
achievement of EBM. It will provide the forum to discuss the needs, impacts and responses of coastal 
communities in a changing marine environment, and to enhance the use of this information by governments 
and society at large.  It will also provide a forum for the connection of ecosystem monitoring  and status 
reporting of both environmental and social indicators (through linkage with MONITOR), and the 
subsequent implementation and adaptation of EBM. 
3. Scientific collaboration and coordination with other international agencies, bodies and societies that are 
engaged in either EBM or human activities that are relevant to the achievement of EBM will be undertaken. 
This will engage expertise not previously active in PICES, such as social-scientists and policy makers.  
4. PULSE will encourage establishment of other component activities, such as developing the basis for 
coupled human science-natural science models, and emerging approaches as needed to facilitate synthesis of 
the FUTURE Program. 
 
Membership 
 
We recommend a membership that will ensure core connection with PICES Committees, key expertise from the 
various disciplines involved in studying ecosystem approaches to management, and national representation.  We 
advocate a nomination process that will closely connect PULSE to PICES Scientific Committees, such as 
ensuring that a member or designate from each Committee and perhaps from the current Study Group on PICES 
Communications in PULSE.  There is also perhaps merit in having member participation from different sectors 
besides fishing (e.g., mariculture) and ecoregions. 
 
 
Advice on the Structure and Content of Future North Pacific Ecosystem Status Reports 
 
WG 19 also considered advice on the structure and content of future North Pacific Ecosystem Status Reports 
(NPESRs), and specifically the inclusion of EBM-related topics in status reports.  An incremental improvement 
version of NPESR is being recommended by Science Board, and we recommend that enhanced information on 
pollution and socio-economics be considered for inclusion.  We discussed the need to identify key pressures in 
each region, and how indicators on status and trends describing human well-being should be determined, and 
concluded that further review on these topics is needed.  Establishment of a PICES Study Group on Indicators of 
Human Well-Being: Benefits and Health is recommended to assist in this effort.  Terms of reference for such a 
group might include:   
1. Identify potential indicators of human-well being and human impacts in relation to the PICES report on 
marine ecosystem status and trends; evaluate the Millennium Ecosystem Report indicators for their 
appropriateness. 
2. Review how these measures might be quantified and standardized across member countries, and if the data 
are available to quantify these. 
3. Review how these measures can be used in ecosystem models and management strategy evaluation 
frameworks. 
  
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 xv 
4. Identify longer-term issues that might be covered by a working group on this topic (governance structures 
for implementation, etc.). 
 
Criteria for selection of membership should include natural and social scientists, including in the latter those with 
strong economic, sociological and anthropologic expertise who are working on questions relating to marine 
ecosystem approaches and management issues.   
 
 
Ecosystem-based Management in International Waters 
 
In the above, all details and discussion presented have been focused on initiatives being undertaken within the 
EEZs of PICES member countries.  While significant progress is being made in these regions to address issues 
related to EBM, the reality is that many species have spatial distributions in the Pacific Ocean that extend well 
beyond national jurisdictions.  For these species, effective EBM can only be realized if national efforts to achieve 
EBM are harmonized with similar multinational efforts in international waters.  To this end, many of the 
initiatives to determine appropriate EBM steps in national waters, such as identifying ecoregions (spatial areas 
with a basically similar mix of species and environment) and within them, ecologically and biologically 
significant areas and species, need to be undertaken in offshore international waters of the PICES region.  
 
  
  
Section 1 Introduction 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 1 
 
1 Introduction 
 
Jamieson and Zhang (2005) noted that under the 
overarching objective of conservation of species and 
habitat, ecosystem-based management (EBM) is the 
implementation of defined objectives related to 
maintaining and monitoring biodiversity, 
productivity and physical and chemical properties of 
an ecosystem. EBM worldwide is now recognized as 
both timely and necessary because 1) in many 
environments, individual ecosystem components are 
presently being utilized, harvested or impacted with 
limited attention paid to the maintenance of the 
integrity of the overall ecosystem, and 2) the scale of 
these impacts is now so large that there is real danger 
of overall negative ecosystem change to the 
detriment of human society. Following 
recommendations of the PICES Study Group on 
Ecosystem-based Management Science and its 
Application to the North Pacific (Jamieson and 
Zhang, 2005), a working group was formed 
(Appendices 1 and 6) to deal with these issues, and 
this report builds on that initiative.   
 
In October 2004, the PICES Working Group on 
Ecosystem-based Management Science and its 
Application to the North Pacific (WG 19) was 
established, under the direction of the Marine 
Environmental Quality Committee (MEQ) and 
Fishery Science Committee (FIS), with the following 
terms of reference: 
1. Describe and implement a standard reporting 
format for EBM initiatives (including more than 
fishery management) in each PICES country, 
including a listing of the ecosystem based 
management objectives of each country.  
2. Describe relevant national marine ecosystem 
monitoring approaches and plans and types of 
models for predicting human and environmental 
influences on ecosystems. Identify key 
information gaps and research and implementation 
challenges. 
3. Evaluate the indicators from the 2004 Symposium 
on “Quantitative Ecosystem Indicators for 
Fisheries Management” for usefulness and 
application to the North Pacific. 
4. Review existing definitions of “ecoregions” and 
identify criteria that could be used for defining 
ecological boundaries relevant to PICES. 
5. Hold an inter-sessional workshop in Year 2 or 3 of 
the WG’s mandate that addresses the status and 
progress of EBM science efforts in the PICES 
region, with the deliverable being either a special 
journal issue or a review article. 
6. Recommend to PICES further issues and activities 
that address the achievement of EBM in the 
Pacific. 
 
The second term of reference above was never 
addressed, as it was later realized that no PICES 
country was advanced enough in EBM applications to 
be at the stage where it was monitoring and actively 
practicing EBM. 
 
This is the final report of WG 19.  It should be noted, 
though, that establishment of ecosystem-based 
approaches to management of human activities in the 
marine environment is very dynamic, and in the three 
years that this report has been in preparation, 
numerous changes have ocurred in each of the PICES 
member countries.  While attempts have been made to 
provide the most relevant and recent data at the time 
of report completion, there are likely many instances 
where, by the time this report is published, some 
elements may be somewhat dated.  Nevertheless, this 
report does provide a snapshot in time in documenting 
where the different PICES countries are in their 
progress towards their achievement of EBM. 
Implementation of EBM is best viewed as an 
incremental adaptive approach, and  thus countries 
should be considered to be in a constant process of 
adaptation toward achieving an agreed upon 
ecosystem approach to management.  
 
This report is structured to first provide an overview 
of why EBM is relevant today, the incentives that are 
making its implementation such a high priority in 
each PICES member country, and how EBM is being 
approached by each of the six member countries in the 
North Pacific.  Section 2 tracks the progress toward 
developing ecosystem approaches, and while the 
primary focus is on fisheries as one of the most 
common economically and socially beneficial uses of 
the North Pacific ecosystem and one that may be a 
significant driver in ecosystem change, there are 
many other relevant human activities of importance to 
Introduction Section 1 
2  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
PICES countries in the North Pacific.  These too are 
becoming part of the forward-looking evaluation of 
EBM. 
 
The next section of this report focuses on the 
development and utility of marine ecosystem 
indicators, which is currently an active research topic 
worldwide.  This is connected with the increased 
interest in moving forward with EBM of marine 
resources, and recognition of the need to index and 
summarize the state of marine ecosystems.  
 
Section 4 focuses on identifying the spatial 
characteristics of North Pacific ecosystems, and how 
the different PICES member countries have 
incorporated these features into their management 
regimes.  Because accounting for spatially explicit 
trends, processes and relationships is a main 
component of EBM, it follows that the spatial 
characteristics of marine ecosystems need to be 
identified in order to provide a context for identifying 
stakeholders, defining objectives, conducting 
research, and implementing policies focused on 
sustainable management of species, goods and 
services. 
 
The report concludes by presenting a brief overview 
summary of regional approaches to EBM, and their 
implications, and suggests relevant actions for PICES 
in the future, i.e., beyond the end of WG 19.  It 
addresses the fact that while all EBM activities to date 
in the North Pacific are occurring within the 
Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of member 
countries, i.e., from the edge of each country’s 
territorial sea (up to 12 nautical miles (22 km)) out to 
200 nautical miles (370 km) from its coast, recent 
international conventions are beginning to focus 
development of EBM in international waters, i.e., 
beyond the EEZs. 
 
Finally, the PICES EBM topic sessions and 
workshops held in association with Annual Meetings 
in Vladivostok, Russia (2005, Session S8 on 
“Ecosystem indicators and models”); in Yokahama, 
Japan (2006, Workshop W3 on “Criteria relevant to 
the determination of unit eco-regions for 
ecosystem-based management in the PICES area”) 
and in Victoria, Canada  (2007  Worskhop W3 on 
“Comparative analysis of frameworks to develop an 
ecosystem-based approach to management and 
research needed for implementation”); see 
Appendix 5) made progress in highlighting the above 
issues with respect to implementation of EBM in 
PICES member countries.  From the presentations, 
especially at the 2007 workshop, it was clear that 
member countries are in different stages of 
implementation with respect to EBM.  Some countries 
are still working on incorporating an ecosystem 
approach to fisheries management while others have 
national legislation that provides a mechanism for 
implementing a cross-sectoral approach to the 
management of marine activities to ensure 
environmental protection. The degree of advancement 
might be partly related to the nature of the different 
human pressures being exerted on the marine 
environment.  Even some of the countries that 
appeared to be more advanced in their implementation 
mentioned problems in actually making cross-sectoral 
management work in marine ecosystems.  Particularly, 
the need for overarching legislation that requires 
action may be needed.  It was clear that more than one 
agency was involved in EBM activities in each 
country and a challenge is to get agencies to work 
together in implementation.  It was also noted that the 
main type of legislation in most nations that forced 
this cross-sectoral implementation was species-at-risk 
legislation.

2.1 Introduction 
 
This section is an effort to identify the efforts of 
PICES member countries in moving toward adoption 
of an EBM approach for fisheries and other sectors.  
Member countries were asked to confirm their 
commitments to, or incorporation of ecosystem-based 
management (EBM) actions or principles, into current 
fisheries and ocean management.  As reported below, 
there is a wide range of effort in this regard, with 
considerable variation in approach and with respect to 
how comprehesive management actions turn out to be.   
The PICES Working Group on Ecosystem-based 
Management Science and its Application to the North 
Pacific (WG 19) regards these efforts as indicative of 
the progress toward EBM – especially with respect to 
fisheries from which we can compare experience and 
gain knowledge.  None of the PICES member 
countries can be seen as fully implementing an 
ecosystem-based approach even for the fisheries 
sector, yet it is apparent that each member is seeking 
to employ and learn from the experience of 
implementing EBM.  It is the hope of WG 19 that 
these experiences will be expanded upon and that as 
an EBM approach encompassing multiple sectors is 
developed among PICES countries, PICES will 
provide a significant focal point for documenting, 
synthesizing and comparing national experiences. 
 
Since the industrial revolution, man’s impact on the 
oceans has increased dramatically, this being 
especially true in recent years.  In nearshore coastal 
areas, human population growth has led to increasing 
pollution and habitat modification. Fishing effects 
have become increasingly severe, with many, if not 
most, traditionally harvested populations now either 
fully exploited or over-fished (Garcia and Moreno, 
2003).  Thus far, management of these activities in the 
North Pacific has been primarily sector-focused. 
Fisheries, for example, have generally been managed 
in isolation of the effects of other influencing factors 
and have targeted commercially important species, 
without explicit consideration of non-commercial 
species and broader ecosystem impacts.  There is an 
increasing international awareness of the cumulative 
impacts of sector-based activities on the ecosystem 
(Jennings and Kaiser, 1998; Kaiser and de Groot, 
2000) and the need to take a more holistic or 
Ecosystem-Based Management approach (Anon., 
1999; Link, 2002; Kabuta and Laane, 2003) to ensure 
the sustainability of marine ecosystems.  Globally, 
there is an emerging paradigm shift in our approach to 
ocean management and usage (Sinclair and 
Valdimarsson, 2003) that is quite broad for which the 
term Ecosystem Approach to Management (EAM) 
applies.   
 
The roots of this change can be found in the 1972 UN 
Conference on the Human Environment, and the 1992 
UN Conference on Environment and Development 
(UNCED) in Rio, itself emanating from the 1973 UN 
Conference on the Law of the Sea which, in turn, 
resulted in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the 
Sea (UNCLOS).  UNCED highlighted the need to 
consider resource management in a broader biological, 
socio-economic and institutional context.  This led to 
follow-up conferences and conventions such as the 
1993 Convention on Biological Diversity, the 1995 
Agreement for the implementation of provisions of 
the UNCLOS relating to the Conservation and 
Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly 
Migratory Fish Stocks (UN Fish Stock Agreement), 
and the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible 
Fisheries, to name a few. FAO has put in place 
International Plans of Action to meet UNCED 
objectives, progress against which was reviewed in 
Johannesburg at the RIO +10 meeting in August, 
2002. At the World Summit on Sustainable 
Development (WSSD), governments obligated 
themselves to an ambitious time frame for 
implementing EBM in marine waters.  Thus, there is a 
growing body of international agreements in support 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management Section 2 
4  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
of EBM.  (See Table 2.1.1 for some examples of the 
involvement of North Pacific nations.)  In addition, 
the transboundary nature of marine resource use and 
management for fisheries, oil and gas, maritime 
transportation, and pollution control make it 
imperative that countries cooperate scientifically to 
observe and understand these activities and their 
interactions.  In Table 2.1.2 we provide some 
examples of North Pacific multilateral regional 
agreements and bilateral agreements that recognize 
the transboundary nature of the ocean environment 
and cooperation needed to take the ecosystem into 
account. 
The focus of this portion of the WG 19 report is to 
track the progress toward developing ecosystem 
approaches by PICES member countries in the North 
Pacific.  The primary focus is on fisheries not only as 
one of the most common economically and socially 
beneficial uses of the North Pacific ecosystem, but 
one that may be a significant driver in ecosystem 
change.  Scientific research that enables better 
understanding of the conditions affecting fishery 
management and the role of fisheries in an ecosystem 
is critical.  Still, as is discussed herein, there are many 
other activities of importance to countries in the North 
Pacific and these, too, can become part of the forward 
looking evaluation of EAM.  
 
 
Table 2.1.1 Examples of international conventions to which PICES member countries are parties.  Note that UNCED and 
WSSD were conferences, not conventions.  However, these meetings did produce some important exhortatory documents 
that have helped popularize and give commitment to sustainable development concepts, including ecosystem-based 
management and integrated management.  Those documents were Agenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation 
(JPOI).  Both were negotiated and adopted by consensus by States, and represent outcomes of conferences.

In order to have a common language and definition of 
EBM/EAM, we developed a typology (Table 2.1.3) 
that served to discipline our Working Group’s 
discourse on this topic.  Further, we have elected to 
construct Country Profiles of efforts to implement 
EAM.  The template for these profiles is in Appendix 2.   
 
The reports provided by each country in the following 
sections demonstrate a high level of interest and a 
diversity of approaches.  This diversity is seen 
positively as experimenting with the concept of 
EAM/EBM, consistent with each country’s 
experience and circumstances.  Through the efforts of 
WG 19, approaches being tried under particular 
circumstances are shown.   
 
Although we have looked primarily at fisheries 
applications, we hope the approach discussed here 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management Section 2 
6  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
will guide PICES in its further research and 
deliberations on EAM in the context of the new 
PICES scientific program, FUTURE (Forecasting and 
Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of 
North Pacific Marine Ecosystems). 
 
 
2.1.1 Ecosystem-based Management/ 
Ecosystem Approach to Management 
Typology 
 
It is useful to agree to a common typology of 
ecosystem approaches to management for purposes of 
discussion because it helps us more rigorously 
evaluate the progress toward EBM, or as its 
sometimes referred to, an Ecosystem Approach to 
Management (EAM).  The typology found in Table 
2.1.3 starts with recognition that even traditional 
management approaches that focus on single sectors 
or species, in the case of fisheries, do take 
considerable ecosystem information into account.  
The more factors and species that are taken into 
account in management decisions, the greater the 
progress toward EAM, e.g., sectoral and ultimately 
integrated management in an ecosystem context. 
 
2.1.2 Country Profiles 
 
Country profiles have been constructed to provide 
background information of how each PICES member 
country has begun to recognize an EBM/EAM in its 
scientific research in support of management 
decisions and societal goals.  We present the country 
reports in alphabetical order.  Each report brings very 
interesting and valuable contributions to our learning 
about how EAM can be applied.  Each country has 
attempted to respond to a systematic set of descriptors, 
listed below: 
1. Definition of EAM objectives/purposes and goals 
2. Agencies involved 
3. Legislative mandates related to EAM. 
4. Current implementation 
5. Future implementation 
 
For current and future work, we developed a template 
(Appendix 2) for assessing concrete progress toward 
developing and implementing EAM in fisheries, and 
provide illustrations by Canada of how it might be 
used.  While there is some deviation from this format 
because of national experience and circumstances, 
this template serves well to organize each of the 
presentations.

PICES Scientific Report No. 37 7 
Describing and documenting EBM is a complex 
enterprise and one that does not fit into a single 
pattern.  Each member country profile presented here 
addresses those components that are part of that 
country’s approach to management.  It is not expected 
that each component may necessarily be discussed in 
each profile.  In fact, diversity in approaches is 
expected and adds to the potential for learning from 
alternative approaches.  Critical to understanding the 
process of implementing EBM is that current efforts 
are seen as building blocks toward eventual fully 
implemented EBM.

2.2.1 Objectives/Purposes, Goals and 
Legislative Mandates for 
Ecosystem-based Management 
 
In Canada, the Fisheries Act, first enacted in 1857, has 
been to date, the prime legislative vehicle governing 
ocean usage, particularly fishing.  It regulates the 
capture, holding and possession of all marine life, and 
makes unlawful the harmful alteration, disruption or 
destruction of fish habitat.  While it is periodically 
revised (most recently in 1991), the focus of the Act 
has been the conservation and protection of 
commercially exploited species and their habitat. 
Similarly, the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act 
regulates the presence of foreign fishing vessels in 
Canadian fisheries waters and since 1977 there have 
been no unauthorised foreign vessels in Canadian 
Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) fisheries. 
Responding to both international legislative changes, 
as well as to concerns for the impacts of human 
activities on its marine ecosystems, Canada enacted 
the Oceans Act in 1997.  This Act outlined a new 
approach to managing oceans and their resources, 
based on the premise that oceans must be managed as 
a collaborative effort among all stakeholders using the 
oceans, and that new management tools and 
approaches are required.  While fishery management 
plans under the Fisheries Act continue to focus on 
target species, the Oceans Act has changed the 
legislative basis for management and now requires 
consideration of the impacts of all human activities on 
Canada’s ecosystems in marine resource management 
plans. 
 
While Canada’s Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
(DFO; also referred to as Fisheries and Oceans 
Canada) had been active in addressing habitat impact 
issues (e.g., oil and gas resource development in 
Atlantic Canada), the Oceans Act has provided a new 
tool in Canada’s development of an EBM approach. 
As a consequence, since 1997 there have been a 
number of initiatives through which Canada’s 
approach to EBM is beginning to emerge. In 2002, 
Canada’s Oceans Strategy was published (Anon., 
2002a), a key element of it being a nationally 
coordinated Integrated Management (IM) program in 
which interested stakeholders and regulators will 
work together to decide on how to best manage 
designated geographic areas (Anon., 2002b).  In 
support of the IM program, DFO has established a 
national coordinating body, termed the Working 
Group on Ecosystem Objectives (WGEO), to 
facilitate the development of best practices for IM and 
oversee regional pilot projects designed to test 
implementation of the concepts.  In 1998, a pilot 
project was established in DFO’s Maritime Region to 
facilitate EBM in the Atlantic Ocean on the eastern 
Scotian Shelf, with a Strategic Planning Framework 
recently produced (Anon., 2003).  Similarly, DFO’s 
Pacific Region joined the Province of British 
Columbia in initiating the Central Coast Land and 
Coastal Resource Management Plan (CCLCRMP) 
process, and has established the pilot Central Coast 
Integrated Management (CCIM) project in another 
IM approach.  The WGEO was instrumental in 
planning a national workshop (Jamieson et al. (2001), 
termed herein as the Sidney workshop) in 2001 to 
outline the objectives to guide EBM and, more 
recently, has initiated an exercise to define 
scientifically-based ecoregion boundaries within 
which ecosystem objectives (EOs) will be established.  
Human activities will be managed in Large Ocean 
Management Areas (LOMAs) in a manner that will 
allow the conceptual ecological objectives for the

2.2.2 Current Implementation 
 
When the Oceans Act was proclaimed in 1997, there 
was little concept in Canada as to what IM actually 
meant in practical terms, not unlike the situation in 
other countries.  Much of the dialogue had been at a 
higher policy level, with little linkage to 
implementation.  Since then, there has been much 
discussion on implementation both in Canada and 
elsewhere, with various approaches starting to emerge 
(e.g., Garcia and Staples, 2000; Pajak, 2000; 
Sainsbury and Sumaila, 2003).  Here, we summarize 
the Canadian perspective on IM, based on our 
experiences with EBM in Canada (O’Boyle and 
Jamieson, 2006).  
 
IM has been defined in Canada as “a commitment to 
planning and managing human activities in a 
comprehensive manner while considering all factors 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 9 
necessary for the conservation and sustainable use of 
marine resources and the shared use of ocean spaces” 
(Anon., 2002a).  IM acknowledges the inter- 
relationships that exist among different uses and the 
environments they potentially affect (Anon., 2002b). 
It will thus involve many facets relating to both what 
activities are undertaken and to how these are 
undertaken when it is finally implemented.  
 
It should be pointed out here that the Oceans Act 
refers to Marine Environmental Quality (MEQ) 
objectives, which are to be incorporated in IM plans to 
facilitate implementation of an ecosystem approach. 
MEQ objectives are functionally synonymous with 
the definition of operational objectives.  Operational 
objectives are the strategies by which conceptual 
objectives are actually implemented. They make the 
link between conceptual and management control. 
Jamieson et al. (2001) considered that an operational 
objective consists of a verb (e.g., maintain), a specific 
measurable indicator (e.g., biomass from a population 
analysis), and a reference point (e.g., 50,000 t for a 
specific species or stock), thus allowing an action 
statement for management (e.g., maintain biomass of 
a given forage species greater than 50,000 t biomass). 
While others might differ on the details of what 
defines an operational objective (e.g., FAO, 2003; 
Sainsbury and Sumaila, 2003), there is consensus on 
the need for indicators and reference points in 
operational objectives.  In this PICES WG 19 report, 
we will use the terms ‘conceptual’ and ‘operational’, 
as they are more in line with usage in the literature. 
 
How the conceptual and operational levels of 
objectives are linked is a critical issue. Jamieson et al. 
(2001) considered components and sub-components 
associated with the high-level conceptual objectives, 
thus creating a ‘branched tree’ of conceptual 
objectives.  They stated, for example, that diversity 
and productivity are components of the ‘conservation 
objective’, and under diversity there are 
sub-components at the community, species and 
population level. For each component and 
sub-component, a conceptual sub-objective is stated 
(e.g., for the diversity component, conserve 
population diversity so that it does not deviate outside 
the limits of natural variability).  Jamieson et al. 
(2001) then provided example operational objectives 
(verb, indicator and reference point, as described 
above) linked to each conceptual objective.  These 
were primarily included to indicate the intent of the 
associated conceptual objective.  
 
Jamieson et al. (2001) translated each of the 
sub-objectives into operational objectives through a 
process termed ‘unpacking’, which involves breaking 
the objectives completed into their component parts 
(Table 2.2.1).  Unpacking involves considering each 
conceptual objective associated with a component/ 
sub-component and determining whether or not a final 
operational objective can be stated.  In other words, 
how best can a measurable indicator and reference 
point (see Appendix 3 for definitions) be associated 
with that sub-objective? This requires an 
understanding of what knowledge and information is 
available upon which indicators and reference points 
can be based.  If this information is available, then the 
unpacking process stops and the final operational 
objective associated with that conceptual objective is 
considered defined.  Otherwise, a further unpacking 
occurs which is again tested for it being a final 
operational objective.  The unpacking stops when all 
conceptual objectives have been addressed. As 
mentioned above, Canada’s Oceans Strategy (Anon., 
2002b) refers to MEQ objectives.  Both of these terms 
are synonymous with the operational objectives that 
would go in management plans.

Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management Section 2 
10  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
With ‘maintenance of productivity’ as an example 
conceptual objective, beginning to unpack it creates 
the statements as maintaining trophic transfers and 
interactions within the foodweb.  However, while this 
restatement is a more tractable concept than 
maintenance of productivity, it is still far from what 
managers can deal with practically.  Therefore, the 
concept of ‘trophic transfers’ is further unpacked.  
This produces a more specific statement on the 
maintenance of forage species, and then, in turn, of 
target escapement.  A point is finally reached where 
some component of the ecosystem is associated with a 
particular measure or indicator, and at this point, the 
objective can be termed ‘operational’. 
 
Before IM can be implemented in Canada, concepts 
and approaches need to be tested in pilot-scale 
initiatives.  Only through a nationally coordinated 
system of pilot studies would the challenges, 
opportunities and utility of different approaches be 
operationally evaluated for consideration in the 
development of a national approach. Such exercises 
would need to include: 
• Synthesis, either through Delphic (see Appendix 3 
definition) or more quantitative approaches, of all 
currently available information including socio- 
economic data, 
• Practical experience in compiling ecosystem-level 
data and their utilization in ecosystem function 
measurements to allow comparison of experiences 
from different situations, 
• Practical experience with regional ‘unpacking’ 
exercises to break down conceptual objectives to 
operational ones, and  
• An assessment of the costs of conducting required 
ecosystem monitoring.  
 
Since the Sidney workshop, many of the above 
recommendations have been or are in the process of 
being acted upon.  Pilot IM projects have been 
established to test the concepts discussed at the 
workshop, including the unpacking exercises (e.g., 
Jamieson et al., 2003; O’Boyle and Keizer, 2003; 
Jamieson and McCorquodale, 2004) to test the 
efficacy of the objectives’ structure and the unpacking 
process reported above. These pilots involve 
consideration of how best to engage managers, clients 
and scientists in consultation and decision making.  It 
will take time for results of these pilots to be realized 
and to determine how the concepts and approaches 
discussed by Jamieson et al. (2001) can be 
implemented over the long term. 
Canada’s IM planning is at the heart of new, modern 
oceans governance and management. It is a 
comprehensive way of planning and managing human 
activities so that they do not conflict with one another 
and so that all factors are considered for the 
conservation and sustainable use of marine resources 
and shared use of oceans spaces. IM is: 
• an open, collaborative and transparent process that 
is premised on an ecosystem approach; 
• involves planning and management of natural 
systems rather than solely political or 
administrative arrangements; 
• is founded on sound science that can provide the 
basis for the establishment of ecosystem 
management objectives. 
 
Canada’s Oceans Strategy calls for the Minister of 
DFO to lead the development and implementation of 
plans for the IM of all activities affecting estuaries, 
and coastal and marine waters. 
 
In the Oceans Action Plan (http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/ 
oceans-habitat/oceans/oap-pao/pdf/oap_e.pdf), DFO 
identified ecoregions nationally and named five 
priority LOMAs across the country in which it will 
coordinate IM efforts.   In the Pacific Region, the 
priority area was the Queen Charlotte Basin, which is 
the Pacific Northern Shelf Ecoregion (see section 4.2, 
Figure 4.2.8).   This area is also now referred to as the 
Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area 
(PNCIMA), and includes the previously identified 
Central Coast Integrated Management Area 
(CCIMA).  The earlier CCIMA work laid the 
foundation for later PNCIMA development. 
 
In initial attempts to develop operation objectives 
from higher-lever conceptual objectives, referred to 
above, it was quickly realized that a solely top-down 
approach could not prioritize objectives, and so a 
combined top-down:bottom-up approach was 
developed. This involves the identification of 
Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas 
(EBSAs; DFO, 2004; Clarke and Jamieson, 2006a,b), 
Ecologically Significant Species (ESSs; DFO, 2006), 
Depleted Species, and Degraded Areas, and through 
consideration and weighting of these data, first 
identifications of highest priority science-based 
conservation objectives (DFO, 2007) will be 
proposed.  This latter process is currently on-going for 
PNCIMA, and is now beginning to be undertaken for 
the other parts of Canada’s Pacific Coast.

2.2.3 Future Implementation 
 
Integrated Management is still in its initial stages in 
Canada. While progress has been made in some areas, 
much remains to be done.  In the short term, Canada 
has stalled implementation of IM nationally – while 
the science process to develop appropriate 
conservation objectives has advanced, the 
complementary consultative process to develop 
appropriate socio-economic objectives has yet to 
commence, at least in Canada’s Pacific Region. 
Jamieson et al. (2001) summarized three main 
recommended next steps to achieving IM in Canada, 
which are still relevant today: 
 
1. Objectives, Indicators and Reference Points 
There is a need to develop objectives for the other 
dimensions of sustainability (social, economic, and 
cultural) through workshops involving the appropriate 
experts. Whereas biology is relatively well 
circumscribed and objective, these other dimensions 
of sustainability tend to be driven by regional and 
local issues, and can be politically charged.  
 
2. Assessment Approaches 
A technical review of ecosystem assessment 
approaches is required, considering their performance 
and sensitivity through simulation exercises using 
existing and simulated data.  
 
3. Research Directions for the Future 
There is a continuing need for research to define 
indicators and reference points related to each 
objective, including consideration of their practicality, 
the extent to which measurements can separate real 
change from background variability, cost of 
measurement, etc.  The direction of this research 
would greatly benefit from unpacking case study 
exercises to identify appropriate indicators and 
reference points for management, which would 
identify gaps in our knowledge to supply this 
information. This research needs to build on 
international initiatives such as the SCOR WG 119 
workshop on Quantitative Ecosystem Indicators for 
Fisheries Management (Cury and Christensen, 2005).  
 
Also, relatively little effort has been put into how one 
would use suites of indicators to meet the totality of 
objectives defined under operational resource 
management plans.  Such an exercise has begun on 
the Eastern Scotian Shelf (O’Boyle et al., 2005) 
where a number of ocean sectors – fishing, oil and gas 
exploration, transport, defence – utilize the area, 
typical of situations both in Canada and elsewhere in 
the world.  A standardized operational framework for 
integrated management will thus be of global interest. 
The suite of national conceptual ecosystem-level 
objectives has been unpacked to a regional level for 
the Eastern Scotian Shelf Integrated Management 
(ESSIM) area to address biodiversity, productivity 
and habitat issues.  Operational objectives, which 
identify an indicator and reference point associated 
with each conceptual objective, are being considered. 
Utilizing Canada’s conceptual objectives unpacking 
protocol, individual ocean sector management plans 
and activities are beginning to be reviewed in a 
consistent manner to determine how they might be 
influenced by the conservation objectives for the area. 
Issues of spatial scale and cumulative impacts are 
beginning to be addressed, as required, and evaluated 
as to how progress against the suite of objectives 
could be reported. 
 
Based on these experiences, it is suggested that the 
following sequential steps be required to effectively 
make the linkage between the high level, national 
objectives and operational objectives necessary for 
implementation of IM: 
1. Identification of the conservation issues and 
threats relevant to the IM area, 
2. Identification of the ecosystem science 
components (EBSAs, ESSs, Depleted Species and 
Degraded Areas) to be conserved, and the 
associated conservation objectives (Figs. 2.2.1 and 
2.2.2), 
3. Determination of the appropriate socio-economic 
(desirable) objectives (Figs. 2.2.1  and 2.2.2), 
4. Definition of operational objectives for the IM 
area, 
5. Definition of operational objectives for each ocean 
sector (fishing, oil and gas, transportation, etc.). 
 
Once the operational objectives are available, 
monitoring programs can be designed to provide the 
indicators and reference points needed for assessment 
and decision making.

2.2.4 Canadian Template of Ocean 
Management Activities 
 
Ecoregion  
 
In 2004, DFO conducted a workshop (Powles et al., 
2004) to identify Canadian marine ecoregions to be 
used as a basis for integrated oceans management, 
using criteria that fell into three broad categories: 
geological properties, physical oceanographic 
properties and biological properties.  The workshop 
resulted in the identification of 17 marine ecoregions 
for Canada’s three oceans:  four in the Pacific (see 
section 4.2, Figure 4.2.8), six in the Arctic and seven 
in the Atlantic.  Here, we describe ocean management 
activities in the PNCIMA, a LOMA whose 
boundaries exactly match one of the identified Pacific 
ecoregions, the Pacific Northern Shelf (Fig. 4.2.8).  Its 
characteristics are represented in the following: 
  
1. Geographic features: It is bounded to the south by 
Brooks Peninsula and extends northward into U.S. 
Alaskan waters.  A distinctive geological feature in 
this ecoregion is the shallow water area in Hecate 
Strait located between the Queen Charlotte Islands 
(officially renamed Hiada Gwai in 2009) and the 
mainland coast. 
   
2. Physical Oceanographic Properties: The shallow 
water area east of the Queen Charlotte Islands 
results in a warm water front and strong mixing, 
and is considered to be a weak boundary within the 
ecoregion. 
 
3. Biological Properties: The Northern Shelf is one 
of 17 ecoregions in the Canadian Pacific, Arctic 
and Atlantic oceans identified by experts within, 
and external to, DFO in 2004.  Four ecoregions 
identified in the Pacific Region are the Strait of 
Georgia (part of the officially named Salish Sea 
(2010) that also includes Juan de Fuca Strait and 
Puget Sound), the Southern Shelf (West Coast of 
Vancouver Island), the Northern Shelf, and 
Offshore.  The Southern Shelf extends from 
Brooks Peninsula on the northwest coast of 
Vancouver Island, south into U.S. waters.  The 
Northern Shelf extends north from Brooks 
Peninsula into Alaskan waters.  Many fish 
populations in the Northern Shelf area are 
managed separately from other populations of the 
same species.  North Coast herring, several 
rockfish and flatfish species, and some other 
groundfish species, for example, are considered 
discrete populations based on biological traits, 
tagging studies which indicate minimal migration 
between geographic zones, and observed variation 
in trends in abundance indicators over time.  
 
General Description of the Oceanographic and 
Biological Setting 
 
The Pacific Northern Shelf is the continental shelf 
portion in the transition zone where the 
eastward-flowing trans-North Pacific Current divides 
into the southward flowing California Current and the 
northward-flowing Alaska Current.  It is included in 
the description of the Gulf of Alaska in PICES (2004). 
Strong seasonality in storm intensity and frequency 
cause strong seasonality in coastal current forcing. 
During the winter, intense southeasterly alongshore 
winds support northward-flowing currents, while in 
the summer, the Eastern Pacific High Pressure system 
expands into the Gulf of Alaska and the associated, 
generally northwesterly winds create southward- 
flowing currents.  Freshwater input varies seasonally 
with maximum discharge in the fall and minimum 
discharge in winter, when much of the precipitation 
is stored as snow.  Water density in coastal waters is 
primarily driven by variations in salinity from 
freshwater input which, along with wind mixing, 
determines the onset and the strength of stratification 
in the spring and summer, with important 
implications for ocean productivity.  
 
The Gulf of Alaska shelf is highly productive and 
supports a number of commercially important fisheries 
such as walleye pollock, salmon, Pacific halibut, other 
flatfish, Pacific herring, crab, and shrimp. The 
nearshore areas serve as important spawning grounds 
and as nursery grounds for juveniles of numerous 
demersal and pelagic species, including salmon, 
walleye pollock, Pacific cod, crab, and over 20 species 
of flatfishes. 
 
Relevant Management Plan, Policy and 
Legislation  
 
DFO is the Department within the government of 
Canada that is responsible for the management and 
safety of waters under federal jurisdiction. The 
Department mandate is largely focused on the 
conservation and allotment of quotas for saltwater 
fisheries on the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic coasts of 
Canada.  To address the need for conservation, DFO 
has an extensive science branch, with research 
institutes in various locations across the country. 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management Section 2 
14  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
Typically, the science branch provides evidence for 
the need of conservation of various species, which are 
then regulated by the Department. DFO maintains a 
large enforcement branch, with peace officers (known 
as Fishery Officers) used to combat poaching and 
foreign overfishing within Canada’s EEZ. The 
Department is also responsible for several 
organizations, including the Canadian Coast Guard 
and the Canadian Hydrographic Service.  
 
The Fisheries Act, passed in 1887 and last modified 
in 1985, is the main legislation under which marine 
resources have been managed. It is focused primarily 
on the management of commercial species, but does 
have some habitat conservation provisions. It 
prohibits the deposit of deleterious substances that 
would alter or degrade water quality, such that it 
would harm fish or fish habitat, into waters 
frequented by fish, such as oceans, rivers, lakes, 
creeks, and streams, or into storm drains that lead to 
such waters.  
 
DFO, through the Fisheries Act, has authority over all 
marine animals and plants, but this Act does not allow 
for the establishment of marine protected areas 
(MPAs).  Where MPAs have been established by 
other federal legislation (e.g., National Park Act), 
fishing may still occur unless specifically closed by 
Fisheries Act regulation. 
 
Provincial land in British Columbia is all land 
between ‘headland to headland’, and while this is 
accepted by the federal government, there is a 
difference of legal opinion as to what constitutes a 
headland.  However, to date, this lack of clarification 
has not resulted in serious jurisdictional problems. 
Thus, in some nearshore waters, seafloor habitat is 
managed by the province but all marine animals 
present are managed federally by DFO.  This means 
that in provincial MPAs, fishing may still occur, 
unless specifically closed there by Fisheries Act 
regulation. 
 
Canada’s Oceans Act, passed in 1997, states that 
“conservation, based on an ecosystem approach, is of 
fundamental importance to maintaining biological 
diversity and productivity in the marine environment”.  
EBM is a guiding principle for implementing oceans 
management and preserving the health of oceans 
under Canada’s Oceans Action Plan.  EBM is the 
management of human activities so that ecosystems, 
their structure (e.g., diversity of species), function 
(e.g., productivity) and overall marine environmental 
quality are maintained.  This ecosystem approach to 
oceans management recognizes that activities must be 
managed in consideration of the interrelationships 
between organisms, their habitats and the physical 
environment.   
 
The Oceans Act calls for: 1) implementation of IM 
plans, 2) development of a national system of MPAs, 
and 3) establishment of MEQ guidelines, objectives 
and criteria.  However, DFO is still determining how 
best to implement IM, and because the other two 
components are in reality a part of IM, progress in 
their implementation is also stalled.  The PNCIMA is 
one of five pilot areas in Canada (the other four are in 
Atlantic Canada) where establishment of IM is 
currently being focused, and as of April 2009, only 
initial draft ecological objectives (EOs) in support of 
IM have been developed. EOs are determined from 
both science (conservation) objectives and 
socio-economic (desirable) objectives, as illustrated 
in Figure 2.2.1.  The threshold relationship between 
conservation and desirable objectives is shown in 
Figure 2.2.2.  Development of the draft EOs is 
ongoing and will be the culmination of a lengthy 
process which involves the completion of an 
Ecosystem Overview Assessment (EOA; Appendix 4) 
for the PNCIMA.  The EOA is a technical document 
to provide IM partners and stakeholders with relevant 
information on marine and coastal ecosystems, 
including regional status and trends, an impact 
assessment and recommendations to management – 
based on the best science and knowledge available – 
in order to support IM planning and further decision 
making. The EOA contains two main parts: 
1.  A LOMA-scale ecosystem description that reports 
on ecosystem status and trends, and the basic 
information necessary to inventory key properties 
and components of ecosystems and describe 
ecosystem relationships and key elements.  This 
part consists of different sections to report on 
influencing systems: 
 a.  geological systems (e.g.,  sedimentology), 
 b.  oceanographic systems (e.g., physical 
oceanography), 
 c.  biological systems (e.g., flora and fauna). 
 
2.  Based on the above background information, the 
second part of the EOA document, “Assessment 
and Conclusions”, provides managers with: 
 a. an assessment that:  
 i. reviews threats and human activities which 
have – or are suspected to have – significant 
impacts at the ecosystem scale;  
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 15 
 ii. assesses and reports on the impacts of 
human activities on ecosystem structure 
and function, and overall marine 
environmental quality; and  
 iii. identifies ecologically and biologically 
significant areas (EBSAs) (Clarke and 
Jamieson, 2006a,b), ecologically 
significant species and community 
properties (ESSCPs), and Depleted Species 
and Degraded Areas; 
 b. recommendations for science managers to 
support planning and management actions in the 
IM area, i.e., in terms of knowledge gaps 
identification, science research planning and the 
use of monitoring programs – be they existing or 
specifically designed – to effectively support 
oceans management in future. 
 
Overall Ecosystem-based Management Objective 
 
• How will the objectives be achieved? 
• What is the timeframe to implement objectives and 
meet goals? 
 
In 2002, DFO held a national workshop (Jamieson et 
al., 2003) which identified national ecosystem-level 
objectives, with associated indicators and reference 
points, that could be used in managing ocean 
activities. Under the overarching objective of 
conservation of species and habitat, the workshop 
defined objectives related to biodiversity, 
productivity and the physical and chemical properties 
of the ecosystem. Under each of these, further nested 
components were defined, along with an unpacking 
process to link these conceptual objectives to those 
suitable for operational management (see Table 2.2.1). 
For each nested component, a suite of biological 
properties or characteristics was developed that 
further described the objective.  Example indicators 
and reference points were also developed by 
operational objective, although further work on these 
at both a national and regional level was required. 
Assessment frameworks that evaluated progress 
against all objectives were discussed simultaneously 
and their potential uses investigated. A major 
achievement of the workshop was development, at a 
national level, of the concepts and terms related to 
EBM.  
 
Two broad overarching general goals for EBM were 
accepted: 
• the sustainability of human usage of 
environmental resources, and 
• the conservation of species and habitats, including 
those other ecosystem components that may not be 
utilized by humans. 
 
Discussion at the workshop was extensive and focused 
on objectives under the conservation goal; for more 
detail, refer to Jamieson et al. (2003). Initial 
conceptual objectives relating to biodiversity, 
productivity and the physical and chemical properties 
of the ecosystem were developed to: 
1. conserve enough components (ecosystems, species, 
populations, etc.) so as to maintain the natural 
resilience of the ecosystem, 
2. conserve each component of the ecosystem so 
that it can play its historic role in the foodweb (i.e., 
not cause any component of the ecosystem to be 
altered to such an extent that it ceases to play its 
historical role in a higher order component), 
3. conserve the physical and chemical properties of 
the system. 
 
The first conceptual objective, biodiversity, has the 
following nested components: 
1. to maintain communities within bounds of natural 
variability, 
2. to maintain species within bounds of natural 
variability, 
3. to maintain populations within bounds of natural 
variability. 
 
Current activities in relation to endangered and 
threatened species would be addressed under the 
species component, which thus provides a link to 
national and international species at risk acts, accords 
and legislation. 
 
The second conceptual objective relates to the 
productivity of the ecosystem, with nested 
components being: 
1. to maintain primary production within historic 
bounds of natural variability, 
2. to maintain trophic structure so that individual 
species/stage can play their historical role in the 
foodweb, 
3. to maintain mean generation times of populations 
within bounds of natural variability. 
 
Current work under the Fisheries Act relates primarily 
to these three components. 
 
The third conservation objective is intended to safe- 
guard the physical and chemical structures within which 
the ecosystem resides, with nested components being: 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management Section 2 
16  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
1. to conserve critical landscape and bottomscape 
features, 
2. to conserve water column properties, 
3. to conserve water quality, 
4. to conserve biota quality. 
 
Example indicators and reference points were also 
developed for some of these objectives. It is expected 
that specific situations within particular ecosystems, 
while starting from the same set of conceptual 
objectives, may produce different operational 
objectives through the unpacking exercise. 
 
O’Boyle and Jamieson (2006) summarized a number 
of initiatives undertaken to explore the structure and 
function of this approach in Canada, in both the 
Atlantic and Pacific, since the 2001 Sidney workshop. 
These include not only the objectives of management, 
both at the conceptual and operational levels, but also 
issues relating to assessment, regulations and 
governance.  They thus span the full complexity of 
what is termed IM.  
 
O’Boyle and Jamieson (2006) also considered 
activities undertaken as part of management 
(functions) separate from the organization of how 
management is achieved (structures) (O’Boyle, 1993). 
Functions involve both goal setting (what one hopes 
to achieve, i.e., objective definition) and control 
activities (how goals are achieved), the latter 
involving both regulation of human activity and the 
monitoring and assessment of the scale and nature of 
impacts.  Structures include what it is that is being 
managed (e.g., determination of ecosystem 
boundaries) and the organization of mandated 
management institutions (decision-makers and 
technical bodies).  Much of their paper was focused 
on IM functions, particularly the determination of 
objectives, with some consideration of IM structure. 
 
A number of lessons were learned (Jamieson et al., 
2003; O’Boyle and Keizer, 2003; DFO, 2004) from 
these exercises.  Having an objectives tree that outlines 
the desired conceptual objectives and that formally 
links these to operational objectives used in everyday 
management forced consideration of why a particular 
indicator should be, or is being, measured.  There was 
a tendency to use data availability to define the 
objective, rather than the converse. There will be 
occasions when documented scientific support for use 
of a particular indicator and reference point is not 
available. In these cases, expert judgement (Delphic 
approach) is appropriate. 
O’Boyle and Jamieson’s (2006) conclusions were that 
IM on Canada’s East and West coasts is still in its 
initial stages. While progress has been made, 
development of IM will be a long-term, ongoing, 
adaptive process that will involve the testing of many 
alternative approaches to determine which approach 
works best and is most cost-effective.  Incorporation 
of conceptual objectives for the dimensions of 
sustainability (social, economic and cultural), 
technical review of ecosystem monitoring approaches, 
and the continuing need for research on appropriate 
indicators and reference points are just some of the 
major IM challenges ahead.  Progress to date has been 
substantial though, and the broad outline of what is 
required to implement IM is starting to emerge, as 
presented in the following. 
 
 
1. Fishery Management  
 
- General approach to management for target and 
non-target species in fisheries 
 
Canadian fishery management is still either species or 
gear-type focused.  Management plans for target 
species, available for Canada’s Pacific Coast as a 
whole, are listed in Table 2.2.2. Ecological objectives 
are just beginning to be incorporated into 
management plans.  Non-target species are typically 
not specifically managed, although regulated area 
closures and catch limits exist in some management 
plans for some species/gear types to avoid incidental 
capture of some species (depleted species, or species 
that are targeted by another gear type) or damage to 
fragile species, such as sponges.  Examples are 
regulated sponge reef closures and sub-area closures 
to address shellfish interception and shallow water 
habitat concerns in the groundfish trawl fishery 
(http://www-ops2.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/xnet/content/
mplans/plans10/Groundfish_2010_june28.pdf; ap- 
pendix 8, section 5.1) and shrimp trawl fishery 
(http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/336240.pdf; sec- 
tion 1.13 and appendix 6).  
 
• How is the ecosystem taken into consideration 
when managing fisheries? 
Initial EOs in support of EBM have only been 
established since April 2007, and their incorporation 
into management plans is an on-going adaptive 
management process, with EOs being refined in both 
number and detail as a gradual shift to effective EBM 
is achieved.  An example of their inclusion to date is 
shown in the shrimp trawl management plan

Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2 
18  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
(http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/336240.pdf; sec- 
tion 8), which discusses Canada’s efforts to date in 
identifying areas and species that require protection or 
other conservation measures. 
 
• How selective is the gear (e.g., bottom trawl, 
midwater trawl, purse seine, long line and trap, 
gillnet and other gear) for the target species? 
Selectivity for target species varies by gear type, as 
does the options available to minimize bycatch. 
Spatial and temporal closures to avoid bycatch are 
sometimes effective and design features of the gear 
can help minimize bycatch of either non-target 
species or undersirable sized individuals such as 
juveniles of target species.  Groundfish trawl bycatchs 
have not been well analyzed, particularly with respect 
to their ecosystem impact implications but since 1996, 
every groundfish trawl vessel has been required to 
have an observer onboard to document bycatch by 
species and weight.  Jamieson and Davies (2004) 
document both the nature and quantity of bycatch in 
the groundfish trawl fishery in PNCIMA. Bycatches 
for other fishing gears are not as well documented, as 
observers are typically not present, and data have not 
been analyzed in detail.  An example of a selectivity 
device is in the shrimp trawl fishery management plan 
(http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/336240.pdf; 
appendix 1, section 6), which typically targets pink 
shrimp (Pandalus borealis eous and P. jordani). 
Voluntary plastic lattice panels are recommended to 
be installed in all otter trawl nets to reduce eulachon 
(Thaleichtys pacificus, an osmerid that currently has a 
reduced abundance) bycatch. 
 
• Does fishery gear target certain sizes or 
life-history stage(s)? 
Mesh sizes and trap escape rings regulations are, in 
some instances, used to target specific sizes and 
life-history stages by allowing the escape of undesired 
animals. 
 
• Is the fishery spatially concentrated? 
• Is the fishery year-round? 
Because of the wide diversity in fisheries in PNCIMA, 
there is a whole range of fishing strategies being used 
for different species.  Some species are year-round 
with a minimum size limit (e.g., Dungeness crab); 
others are year-round with individual vessel quotas 
(IVQs), or have specific closed periods, and many 
have spatial restrictions, either as to where fishing can 
occur or to limit the amount of fishing activity (e.g., 
number of vessels) that can occur in an area. 
Management plan features are summarized in Table 
2.2.3. 
 
• Are certain geographic areas excluded from the 
fishery?  Explain reason for the exclusion. 
In some cases, yes, for the following alternative 
reasons: 
1. to avoid bycatch and/or to conserve biogenic 
habitat (e.g., sponge reef closures), 
2. to protect spawning stock and/or habitat and 
hopefully, to enhance recruitment (e.g., rockfish 
conservation areas), 
3. to protect communities in MPAs, which can be 
established for a variety of reasons (see Jamieson 
and Lessard, 2000). 
 
• Are there catch limits on non-target species? 
Not usually, but they do occur for some depleted 
species (e.g., eulachon ‘action levels’, in shrimp trawl 
fisheries) when the species is normally fished by 
another gear type (e.g., prawns (normally trapped) in a 
shrimp trawl fishery), or when different quotas exist 
for species caught by the same gear (e.g., salmon 
species).  When a certain biomass of eulachon (action 
level) is caught, the fishery may be closed.  Likewise, 
no more than 100 prawns (all prawns caught must be 
retained) are allowed on a vessel while fishing. If 
prawn catch levels become too high, the area is closed 
to shrimp trawling. 
 
• Is the catch of non-target species recorded and 
accounted for? 
The groundfish trawl fishery has had 100% observe 
reporting of all bycatch since 1996.  The shrimp trawl 
fishery requires estimates of bycatch to be provided 
for certain species.  Other fisheries do not as of yet 
require bycatch reporting, which creates difficulties in 
the gathering of necessary inputs for EBFM. 
 
• What is the environmental variability (e.g., 
physical disturbance regime; El Niño, typhoon, 
changes in current strength) and how do species 
respond, if known? 
Periodic North Pacific regime shifts and El Niño 
events have an impact on the Pacific North Coast 
ecoregion.  Water temperatures, in particular, may 
vary, which can impact some species.  Migrating 
salmon seem to be particularly impacted, as in colder 
water periods, most salmon migrate to the Fraser

River from the outside of Vancouver Island, while in 
warmer water periods, most migrate through 
Johnstone Strait (see section 4.2, Figure 4.2.8) which, 
because of tidal mixing with deeper colder waters, is 
cooler.  Because this region is also in the transition 
zone between many southern and northern species, 
ranges and relative abundance of different species 
may consequently vary. In El Niño years, for example, 
more southern species occur in abundance farther 
north (e.g., hake in Queen Charlotte Sound). The 
relative copepod species proportions between 
southern and northern species can also change 
significantly. 
 
• What is the spatial distribution of the fishery 
compared to the distribution of the target species?   
With so many regional fisheries, this is difficult to 
answer. Many fisheries target mobile species when 
they are concentrated in abundance, such as spawning 
or feeding aggregations, or when they are 
concentrated by topography while migrating (e.g., 
salmon in the confines of Johnstone Strait.  With 
relatively sedentary nearshore invertebrate species 
like sea urchins, crabs and clams, fisheries occur 
where high abundances of these species occur, which 
are often dependent on substrate characteristics. 
Figure 2.2.3 shows the spatial distribution of 
commercial trawl effort in recent years for the 
northern British Columbia (BC) coast. 
 
 
2. Management of Threatened or Protected 
Species and Communities 
 
- General approach to management of threatened or 
protected species and communities   
 
Oceans Act 
 
Under the Oceans Act, the main deliverable for Phase 
I of the Ocean Action Plan (OAP) for the Pacific 
Region is the establishment of a LOMA planning 
process for the North and Central coasts called the 
Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area 
(PNCIMA).   PNCIMA will: 1) focus on addressing 
management needs and priorities related to multiple 
ocean uses, 2) be a collaborative planning and 
management process and 3) augment and consolidate 
decision making processes in the Queen Charlotte 
Basin.  
 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2 
20  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
The aim of the Plan is to augment and consolidate 
decision making processes and link sector planning 
and management to an overarching set of 
management objectives and targets.  Regulatory 
authorities will continue to remain responsible and 
accountable for implementing management policies 
and measures within their mandates and jurisdictions. 
Rather than build an entirely separate process, the 
goal of the PNCIMA plan is to build references and 
linkages to existing management strategies and 
actions.  DFO is currently preparing the background 
documentation required to inform this process.  Part 
of this documentaion is the identification of EBSAs 
(DFO, 2004), ESSCPs (DFO, 2006), and Depleted 
  
Species and Degraded Areas which, as a first effort 
for PNCIMA, was completed for EBSAs (Clarke and 
Jamieson, 2006a,b). These will be used to determine 
conservation objectives (DFO, 2007). 
 
Species at Risk Act (SARA) 
 
The Species at Risk Act (SARA) was created to 
protect wildlife species from becoming extinct by:  
1) providing for the recovery of species at risk due to 
human activity and 2) ensuring, through sound 
management, that species of special concern do not 
become endangered or threatened.   The Act became 
law in June 2003.  It includes prohibitions against

Islands (Haida Gwai) from 1996–2004.  Data were plotted using a 1 km

 grid. Grids are colour coded by decile of the 
cumulative distribution, with the highest density coloured red and the lowest light blue.  The histogram summarizes the 
percentage of the fished area covered by each decile.  The line graph shows the depth distribution of effort (from Sinclair, 2007).

killing, harming, harassing, capturing or taking 
species at risk, and against destroying their critical 
habitats.  Marine PNCIMA species listed at risk under 
SARA or other criteria can be found in Table 2.2.4. 
Recovery plans have been developed for many of the 
COSEWIC-listed species 
 
Protected Areas 
 
Protected areas in PNCIMA have been established 
under many different federal and provincial Acts 
(Jamieson and Lessard, 2000), and management plans 
have been written for only some of them.  As 
indicated above, DFO manages all living marine 
animals, and management plan references for 
individual species or species groups are given in 
Table 2.2.3.  There are presently no DFO Oceans 
Act-legislated MPAs in PNCIMA, so in the mpas 
legislated by other provincial or federal Acts in 
PNCIMA, two management plans are needed: one for 
substrate habitat by the appropriate agency that 
designated the mpa, and a DFO one for living 
resources.  Many PNCIMA protected areas do not yet 
have specific management plans for either species or 
substrate.  However, there is a plan to harmonize 
management objectives for mpas between the 
different agencies involved, but when this will be 
effected has yet to be determined. 
 
- General approach to designation (legal/ 
regulatory framework), management and 
recovery of threatened or protected species/ 
communities [describe ecological properties of the 
species or groups that make them vulnerable and in 
need of protection.] 
 
• Is there legislation for designating species at risk? 
• How are threatened species identified, and are 
there timeframes for developing recovery plans? 
• Are recovery thresholds identified above which a 
species no longer needs legal protection?  
The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife 
in Canada (COSEWIC), an independent body of 
experts, was created in 1977 when the need for a 
single, official, scientifically sound, national 
classification of wildlife species at risk was 
 
recognized. COSEWIC has developed and 
periodically modified its operating procedures, the 
categories of risk and their definitions, and its 
assessment procedures to fine-tune its operations. 
COSEWIC’s mandate currently considers vertebrates 
(mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes), 
plants, molluscs, and arthropods. COSEWIC has the 
power to designate species on an emergency basis 
when there is a clear immediate danger of serious 
decline in the species population and/or range, or 
when such a decline is already in progress and will 
continue unless immediate corrective actions are 
taken, and when the delay involved with going 
through the normal process could contribute to the 
species’ jeopardy. 
 
The COSEWIC process is divided into three 
sequential steps, each of which has a tangible outcome. 
These are: 1) selection and prioritization of species 
requiring assessment – COSEWIC Candidate List and 
the Priority List;  2) compilation of available data, 
knowledge and information – COSEWIC status 
report; and 3) assessment of a species’ risk of 
extinction or extirpation and subsequent designation – 
the record of COSEWIC assessment results.  Species 
get on the SARA list by being designated ‘at risk’ by 
COSEWIC. The federal Cabinet then decides whether 
those species should get legal protection under the Act, 
following consultations with affected stakeholders 
and other groups (http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/ 
default_e.cfm).  More details can be obtained at the 
COSEWIC website (http://www.cosewic.gc.ca/eng/ 
sct0/assessment_process_e.cfm). 
 
In Canada, the identification of recovery thresholds 
above which a species no longer needs legal 
protection is proving to be a non-trivial exercise. A 
national workshop was held on this topic (DFO, 2005), 
and a precautionary framework that has three zones 
for a population – healthy, cautious and critical – 
seems useful.  It was determined that there are both 
strengths and weaknesses in placing a 
biologically-based recovery target at either the 
critical–cautious boundary or at the cautious–healthy 
boundary.  There is, at present, no compelling 
scientific argument pointing to one position or the 
other, or to any specific position between them.

3. Habitat Management 
 
- General approach to management of habitats    
 
The mandate of the Habitat Management Program in 
DFO is to: 1) protect and conserve fish habitat in 
support of Canada’s coastal and inland fisheries 
resources, and 2) conduct environmental assessments 
under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 
before DFO makes a regulatory decision under the 
habitat provisions of the Fisheries Act. 
 
The federal government has constitutional authority 
for seacoast and inland fisheries.  Legislatively, it has 
exercised this authority through the Fisheries Act, one 
of the oldest acts in Canada.  The Fisheries Act 
contains provisions to conserve and protect fish 
habitat (defined in subsection 34(1) of the Fisheries 
Act as “spawning grounds and nursery, rearing, food 
supply and migration areas on which fish depend 
directly or indirectly in order to carry out their life 
processes”) that sustain Canada’s fisheries resources. 
 
There are two types of habitat provisions in the 
Fisheries Act: habitat protection and pollution 
prevention.  A key habitat protection provision is 
subsection 35(1). This section prohibits the harmful 
alteration, disruption or destruction (HADD) of fish 
habitat without an authorization from the Minister of 
DFO, or by regulation.  Other habitat protection 
provisions include dealing with obstructions 
impeding the free passage of fish and with the 
minimum flow of water for fish. 
 
Section 36 of the Act is the key pollution prevention 
provision.  It prohibits the deposit of deleterious 
substances into waters frequented by fish unless 
authorized by regulation or by federal laws.  The 
administration of section 36 has been assigned to the 
Minister of the Environment. However, the Minister 
of DFO is responsible to Parliament for all sections of 
the Act. 
 
The national Habitat Management Plan (HMP) has 
responsibility for conducting environmental 
assessments under the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act prior to regulatory decisions being 
made by DFO under laws administered by the 
Department. This includes the issuance of 
authorizations of a HADD under section 35 of the 
Fisheries Act. 
 
The Policy for the Management of Fish Habitat, 
tabled in Parliament in 1986, provides guidance for 
the administration of the habitat provisions of the 
Fisheries Act and a comprehensive framework for the 
management of Canada’s fish habitat resource base in 
the context of sustainable development.  It includes 
the overall objective of net gain for habitat for 
Canada’s fisheries resources and outlines the three 
goals to reach this objective: fish habitat conservation, 
fish habitat restoration, and fish habitat development. 
It also includes a guiding principle of ‘No net loss’ (a 
working principle by which the Department strives to 
balance unavoidable habitat losses with habitat 
replacement on a project-by-project basis so that 
further reductions to Canada’s fisheries resources due 
to habitat loss or damage may be prevented) which 
allows development to proceed where compensation 
of loss of fish habitat is acceptable. 
 
- General approach to management of habitats 
(including biological habitat such as corals, 
seagrass beds, etc., as well as physical habitat) 
[describe ecological properties of the habitat that 
makes it significant.] 
 
• Are specific habitats designated for protection, 
and what legislation allows for the designation? 
The Policy for the Management of Fish Habitat 
protects fish habitats by administering the Fisheries 
Act and incorporating fish habitat protection 
requirements into land and water use activities and 
projects.  Procedures for implementing the no net loss 
guiding principle are used as an integral part of the 
strategy to deal with proposed works and 
undertakings that could affect fisheries.  DFO ensures 
a uniform and equitable level of compliance with 
statutes, regulations and policies, as necessary to 
manage and protect fish habitats in jurisdictions 
where the federal government manages fisheries.  The 
Fisheries Act contains powers to deal with damage to 
fish habitat, destruction of fish, obstruction of fish 
passage, necessary flow requirements for fish, the 
screening of water intakes and the control of 
deleterious substances.  Potential adverse effects on 
fish habitats are frequently avoided by modifying the 
plans, designs and operating procedures for projects 
and activities, and by incorporating mitigation and 
compensatory measures.  
 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 27 
• Are there monitoring and inventory activities in 
place? 
Proponents of an activity that might affect fish habitat 
may be asked to provide an assessment of the potential 
impact of existing or proposed works and undertakings 
on the fisheries resource.  Usually such requests would 
apply to major projects (potentially having significant 
negative impacts on the habitats supporting Canada’s 
important fisheries resources).  Assessments include 
project-specific information on the resource in question, 
and supporting habitat and baseline fisheries 
information required to assess the potential impact of 
the proposed project.  Costs of mitigating any 
anticipated damages, and for implementing 
compensation measures and facilities designed to avoid 
losses of fish habitat and reductions in the supply of 
fish, are the responsibility of proponents.  DFO 
conducts detailed reviews, frequently and preferably as 
a participant in a provincial or federal environmental 
review process, of major proposed industrial 
undertakings that could potentially harm habitats 
supporting the fisheries resources.  
 
• Are there restoration plans or activities 
underway? 
DFO initiates projects and provides advice to other 
interested groups to restore and develop fish habitats, 
in support of the net gain (an increase in the productive 
capacity of habitats for selected fisheries brought about 
by determined government and public efforts to 
conserve, restore and develop habitats) objective. 
Under this strategy, habitats may be restored by 
rehabilitating streams; by eliminating or controlling 
exotic species, predators, parasites, and competitors; by 
removing man-made and storm-related physical 
barriers and other initiatives; and, in cooperation with 
Environment Canada, requiring the installation and 
operation of suitable waste treatment technology. 
Where it manages the fisheries directly, DFO will 
provide advice and guidance to community and 
conservation groups that wish to undertake habitat 
restoration and development projects; financial support 
also may be provided, depending on the availability of 
public funds for this purpose.  
 
- Evaluate the effectiveness of decisions taken and 
techniques used to conserve, restore and develop 
fish habitats 
 
1. Recognizing limitations in the ability to predict 
changes to fish habitats arising from proposed 
actions, the Department aims to monitor the 
effects, both during and, for a prescribed period, 
after development.  In this way the effectiveness 
of departmentally prescribed conditions of 
approval, intended to maintain the productive 
capacity of fish habitats, would be evaluated and 
new knowledge acquired.  
2. Proponents may be required to undertake 
follow-up monitoring studies on the 
effectiveness of habitat mitigation and 
compensation prescriptions as a condition of 
project approval by the Department, and subject 
to prior discussion and agreement with the 
proponent on the scope and schedule for 
monitoring.  
 
• Are there ecologically or biologically significant 
habitat types/areas that can be identified and are 
they given special protection, and are there 
standards (e.g., no activities allowed or just 
limitation of human activities in the habitat) for the 
level of  protection? 
See “2. Management of Threatened or Protected 
Species and Communities” for the identification of 
EBSAs.  These areas under IM are to be more closely 
managed and monitored to ensure the conservation of 
features identified as ecologically and biologically 
significant, but IM has yet to be established in 
Canada. 
 
  
4. Community/Trophic Structure Management 
 
- General approach to management of food webs in 
general and of direct feeding interactions 
specifically 
    
• Are the characteristics of the community altered 
by human activities (e.g., eutrophication, pollution, 
species introductions, sedimentation, altered 
coastal circulation, dredging and filling, altered 
hydrography of rivers, fishing, etc.)?   
• Are management activities affecting food-webs or 
do existing food web perturbations constrain 
moving to a desired state? 
 - Does specific legislation address issues relevant 
to food webs? 
 - Are there monitoring and inventory activities in 
place? 
 - Are there restoration plans or activities 
underway? 
 - Are there ecologically or biologically significant 
species interactions that can be identified and are 
they given special consideration, and are there 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2 
28  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
standards (e.g., ballast water, coastal 
development, water quality) for the level of 
protection? 
 
Although desirable “Community Properties” have 
been identified as something to conserve (DFO, 2006), 
the reality is that in Pacific Canada at least, the 
required data to evaluate what the current status of 
these properties is does not exist, and there are no 
programs underway that are currently collecting the 
required data for future assessment.  However, since 
species in the higher trophic levels are often the ones 
that have been, or are being, most perturbed, the 
Species at Risk Act does address indirectly to some 
extent conservation of community/trophic structure. 
 
 
5. Management of Contaminants and Pollutants 
 
There are both federal and provincial approaches to 
the management of toxins and pollutants, in part 
depending on whether federal or provincial land or 
water is involved. Canadian Provinces have 
considerable authority, and are deemed to have 
control over most terrestrial land, freshwater and 
coastal seafloors (not the water column) between 
headlands. 
 
- General approach to management of contami- 
nants and pollutants 
 
Federal Legislation 
 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) 
 
The federal Canadian Environmental Protection Act 
(CEPA) of 1999 authorizes the Minister of the 
Environment and Minister of Health to investigate a 
wide variety of substances that may contaminate the 
environment and cause adverse effects on 
environmental or human health.  The federal 
government is responsible for the management of 
risks to health and the environment posed by 
substances found to be toxic under CEPA.  Under the 
federal Toxic Substances Management Policy, which 
is administered under CEPA, substances are 
considered toxic if they conform to the definition of a 
toxic substance as specified in CEPA.  CEPA sets 
time limits for developing management strategies for 
substances found to be toxic under the Act.  These 
strategies can include the preparation of regulations, 
pollution prevention plans, environmental emergency 
plans, environmental codes of practice, and 
environmental release guidelines.  Once a substance 
has been determined to be CEPA-toxic, management 
strategies are developed with one of two possible 
objectives: 1) life-cycle management of the substance 
to prevent or minimize its release to the environment, 
or 2) virtual elimination of the substance from the 
environment.  However, for CEPA-toxic substances 
which are also bioaccumulative, persistent and 
anthropogenic, the Act requires virtual elimination of 
that substance.  CEPA does not regulate pesticides 
unless the active ingredient also has a non-pesticidal 
use and has been categorized as toxic under CEPA.  
The federal government policy for addressing toxic 
substsances is called the Toxic Substances 
Management Process.  
 
Under the authority of CEPA, the Minister of the 
Environment can sign political commitments and 
agreements to address key issues of environmental 
protection and health.  The Canadian Council of 
Ministers of the Environment (CCME), which includes 
federal, provincial and territorial environment 
ministers, has signed such an agreement, the Canada- 
Wide Accord on Environmental Harmonization and 
the Canada-Wide Environmental Standards 
Sub-Agreement.  Under the framework of this 
agreement, the CCME develops Canada-wide 
Standards (CWSs) with the objective of establishing 
and achieving common environmental standards 
throughout Canada.  CWSs can target specific 
substances or a number of sectors, sources, and 
substances.  Action relating to the CWSs is taken by the 
jurisdiction deemed most appropriate.  For many of the 
CWSs, action will be implemented by the provinces 
and territories.  Where the federal government is 
identified as the most appropriate jurisdiction, 
regulations, codes of practice, or other preventive 
control instruments may be developed under CEPA.

Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 29 
Fisheries Act 
 
While responsibility for the administration and 
enforcement for the Fisheries Act lies primarily with 
the federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, since 
1978, the Minister of the Environment has had 
responsibility for the administration and enforcement 
of subsection 36(3) of the Act, which prohibits the 
deposit of substances that are deleterious to fish into a 
place where the substance may enter or does enter 
waters that are frequented by fish.  Under this 
provision, the discharge of any quantity of a 
deleterious substance is prohibited, unless there is a 
regulation that permits that discharge.  Under the 
Fisheries Act, any substance that may harm fish or 
alter fish habitat is considered deleterious.  In addition, 
a number of sector-specific regulations under the 
Fisheries Act limit the release of toxic substances to 
the environment.   
 
In addition, regulations for specific sources or 
industry sectors have been developed under the 
Fisheries Act.  These include Pulp and Paper Effluent 
Regulations, Metal Mining Effluent Regulations, and 
Petroleum Refinery Liquid Effluent Regulations. 
 
For additional information on the Fisheries Act, the 
general provisions of subsection 36(3), and the 
regulations pertaining to sector-specific releases of 
toxic substances, refer to http://www-heb.pac.dfo 
-mpo.gc.ca/water_quality/fish_and_pollution/fish_act
_e.htm 
 
Pest Control Products Act (PCPA) 
 
The federal Pest Control Products Act (PCPA) is 
administered and enforced by the Pest Management 
Regulatory Agency (PMRA) for the Minister of Health.  
The PCPA regulates the use of substances that claim to 
have a pest control use and also substances such as 
formulants, adjuvants, and contaminants that are 
contained in pest control products.  All compounds 
used for pesticidal purposes in Canada must be 
registered under the PCPA.  Applications for pest 
control product registrations are reviewed by PMRA.  
In consultation with Environment Canada, PMRA 
considers science-based health, environmental, value 
and efficacy assessments for each pesticide prior to 
approving its use.  Revisions to the PCPA have been 
completed and the revised PCPA came into force June 
28, 2006.  Under the revisions to the Act, PMRA will 
be able to provide to Environment Canada scientific 
studies and data that were submitted by chemical 
companies to support product registration.  In BC, 
Environment Canada, in consultation with Fisheries 
and Oceans Canada, advises PMRA on regional 
concerns relating to unregistered pesticides and 
requests for emergency registrations.   
 
For more information on the PCPA and the regulation 
of pesticides in Canada, refer to the PMRA website at 
http://www.pmra-arla.gc.ca/english/index-e.html. For 
an explanation of the recent revisions to the PCPA,

Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA) 
 
This Act is administered by the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Agency, which is 
accountable to Parliament through the Minister of the 
Environment.  The CEAA specifies the 
responsibilities and procedures for conducting 
environmental assessments on projects conducted in 
Canada, which involve federal government decision 
making.  The objective of the Act is to ensure that such 
projects do not cause significant adverse environment 
effects, by promoting a cooperative approach under 
which the federal and provincial governments review 
the potential impacts of these projects before 
decisions and actions are taken by the federal 
government.  The process provides an opportunity for 
First Nations and public participation.  The 
regulations under this Act identify the projects and 
classes of projects whose potential for causing 
adverse environmental impacts is considered 
sufficient to require an assessment under the CEAA. 
For more information on the CEAA, refer to 
http://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/013/index_e.htm. 
 
Migratory Birds Convention Act 
 
Section 35(1) of the Migratory Birds Convention Act 
prohibits the deposit of oil, oil wastes or any other 
substance harmful to migratory birds in any area 
frequented by migratory birds.  Under this Act it is an 
offence to harm the habitat of migratory birds while 
the birds are in residence at the site.  This includes the 
release of harmful substances (including pesticides) to 
areas frequented by them. For more information on 
the Migratory Birds Convention Act, search in 
http://www.ec.gc.ca. 
 
Fertilizers Act 
 
The Fertilizers Act is administered by Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency (CFIA).  Fertilizers and 
supplements imported into or sold in Canada must be

Federal Programs for Managing Municipal 
Wastewater Effluents 
 
• In November 2003, the CCME agreed to develop a 
Canada-wide strategy for the management of 
municipal wastewater effluents (http://www. 
ccme.ca/ourwork/water.html?category_id=81). 
The strategy includes: 1) a harmonized regulatory 
framework, 2) coordinated science and research, 
and 3) an environmental risk management model.   
• Environment Canada is developing a 
comprehensive federal strategy for municipal 
wastewater effluents, including addressing a 
number of substances found in municipal 
wastewater effluent that have been assessed as toxic 
under CEPA 1999.  A contemplated long-term 
requirement of the federal stragegy is a regulation 
under the Fisheries Act which would include 
wastewater effluent standards equivalent in 
performance to conventional secondary treatment, 
with additional treatment where required.  
• A CCME CWS on mercury for dental amalgam 
wastes was prepared in 2001.  Through the 
collection and recycling of amalgam wastes and 
the use of advanced amalgam separator units at 
dental clinics, the amount of mercury discharged 
to sewer systems will be reduced.  The intent of the 
CWS was to reduce environmental releases of 
dental amalgam in Canada by 95% by 2005, 
compared to releases in 2001. 
• Under the Georgia Basin Action Plan (GBAP), 
Environment Canada, in cooperation with 
interested partners, is undertaking a projects to: 
 - determine molecular level (genomic) toxicology 
of municipal wastewater effluents at receiving 
water concentrations to fish;  
 - utilize in-house developed gene micro-arrays for 
salmonids to evaluate gene expression to either 
freshwater rainbow trout or seawater acclimated 
Pacific salmon.  Effluents will be collected from 
the Greater Vancouver Regional District 
(GVRD) and Capital Regional District and 
adjusted to relevant receiving water 
concentrations in concert with District staff; 
 - analyze select pharmaceuticals and fragrance 
compounds in-house and profile for molecular 
toxicity; 
 - conduct sterol and select pharmaceutical 
chemistry on each effluent sample collected 
(~60 samples); 
 - educate homeowners on the correct ways to care 
for their septic systems;  
 - supporting technical and scientific conferences, 
such as the Annual BC Waste and Water 
Association Conference and Tradeshow.

Provincial Legislation 
  
Environmental Management Act (EMA) 
 
The BC Ministry of the Environement (BC MOE) is 
responsible for managing the release of wastes and 
other contaminants from the industrial and 
agricultural sectors, with the exception of waste 
discharges to the air in the GVRD which is under the 
jurisdiction of the GVRD.  The pertinent provincial 
legislation is the Environmental Management Act 
(EMA), which controls the handling, disposal and 
release of wastes from industrial, provincial and 
municipal sources.  The EMA was brought into force 
on July 8, 2004 and replaced the BC Waste 
Management Act (WMA).   
 
Through a permitting system, the WMA had enabled 
allowable releases to be determined, based on 
scheduled standards (generally discharge volume, 
toxicity and chemical/compound concentration).  
Monitoring requirements in the permits depended on 
factors such as daily discharge rate and receiving 
environmental characteristics and, in some instances, 
receiving environment monitoring was required and 
was determined on a facility/site-specific basis.  
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 31 
Under the WMA, all discharges to the environment 
from industry, trades and businesses had to be 
authorized by the Ministry.  However, the new EMA 
takes a risk-based approach in the authorization to 
discharge waste. Activities considered to be of 
medium to high-risk will require authorization to 
discharge waste.  However, activities considered to be 
low risk will not require authorization to discharge, 
but will remain subject to the requirement that they 
not cause pollution.  The BC MOE will prescribe 
industries/activities which require a waste discharge 
authorization through the EMA’s Waste Discharge 
Regulation.  Industries posing a high risk to the 
environment (such as mines and pulp mills) will 
require a valid authorization such as a permit or 
adherence to an existing regulation.  Industries or 
activities considered to pose a modest risk to the 
environment will be required to adhere to 
province-wide codes of practice for that industry 
sector or activity.  Operations will continue to require 
authorization through a permit, approval or regulation 
until accepted codes of practice have been established 
for that prescribed industry sector or activity. For 
more information on the Environmental Management 
Act refer to http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/main/ 
ema.htm. 
 
Integrated Pest Management Act (IPMA) 
 
The Integrated Pest Management Act (IPMA) 
replaced the Pesticide Control Act in 2004.  Under 
this Act, the BC MOE addresses the application, 
storage, sale, transport and disposal of pesticides.  The 
provincial integrated pesticide management program 
includes education and training programs, the 
licencing and certification of applicators and vendors, 
reviewing Pesticide Management Plans for managing 
pests, and the issuing of permits for the use of certain 
pesticides.  For more information on the Integrated 
Pest Management Act and the provincial integrated 
pest management program, refer to http:// 
www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/ipmp/regs/index.htm. 
 
Mines Act 
 
The Mines Act, which is administered by the BC 
Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, 
regulates the operation, health and safety of all BC 
mines.  The regulations and orders under this Act 
prescribe most aspects of mine design and operation, 
like the stability of mine openings, dams and 
enclosures, and the prevention of pollution such as 
from acid rock drainage or acid mine drainage (AMD).  
Since 1969, this Act has required all mines to have 
bonds or letters of credit sufficient to ensure 
reclamation of mined lands. For more information on 
AMD, see http://www.focs.ca/reports/Catface_info_ 
pkg/Acid%20Mine%20Drainage--FNEHIN.pdf. 
 
 
6. Management of Aquaculture 
 
A useful web site to review is the State-of-Knowledge 
Presentation for the Special Committee on 
Sustainable Aquaculture of the British Columbia 
Legislature at http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/ 
aquaculture/sok-edc/aquamanage-gestionaqua-eng.htm.  
 
The Strategic Plan objectives of 2005–2010 are to 
deliver programs that reflect the priorities of 
Canadians, in which aquaculture governance is a 
priority to achieve: 
- healthy and productive aquatic ecosystems, 
- sustainable fisheries and aquaculture. 
 
General characteristics of aquaculture activities (e.g., 
stocking or releasing of seed/fry/juveniles, production 
of individuals in contained environments) relative to 
the PNCIMA are: 
- Finfish net pen culture of Atlantic salmon is 
primarily in the Broughton Archipelago; some 
sites are likely provincially licenced for sablefish 
but are not actively culturing this species yet; 
- There are some test pilot shellfish aquaculture sites 
in First Nation territories;  
- Very little shellfish culture in the PNCIMA (water 
is generally too cold); 
- Shellfish culture of mussels (Mytilus 
galloprovincialis, M. edulis, M. trossulus), oysters 
(Crassostrea gigas), scallops (Pactinopecten 
yessoensis), and manila clam (Venerupis 
philippensis); 
- The provincial government (Ministry of 
Agriculture and Lands) has authority to approve 
species cultured and licence requirements; 
- Culture methodology is dependant on the species 
being cultured; 
- Future cultures may include geoducks (Panope 
abrupta) and cockles (Clinocardium). 
 
 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2 
32  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
• Do specific regulations address issues relevant to 
species selection, scale of the operation, spatial 
distribution, and environmental impact of 
activities? 
Species selection:  
-  is provincially regulated as part of the licence 
obtained; movement of species is regulated by the 
DFO introductions and transfer committee, and 
listed in the licence. 
 
Scale of operation and spatial distribution: 
- finfish are regulated by provincial and federal 
siting rules, provincial Finfish Aquaculture Waste 
Control Regulation, Fisheries Act Authorizations, 
including DEPOMOD modeling (modelling the 
deposition and biological effects of waste solids 
from marine cage farms), provincial land tenure 
requirements, and Transport Canada approval; 
- shellfish are regulated by provincial management 
plan, conditions, siting and mitigation 
requirements within the Habitat Management 
Operational Statement or Letter of Advice, 
provincial land tenure requirements (some sites 
require Transport Canada approval). 
 
Environmental impact:  
-  The provincial government requires monitoring of 
the benthic condition within the tenure under the 
provincial Finfish Aquaculture Waste Control 
Regulation.  Under the provincial regulation, 
restocking cannot occur until near-field oxic 
conditions are demonstrated.  This requirement 
limits the possibility for long-term habitat loss and 
cumulative effects.  Fallowing is required prior to 
restocking in the event near-field anoxic 
conditions reported under the provinicial Finfish 
Aquaculture Waste Control Regulation.  
Site-specific differences have been observed with 
respect to benthic recovery and further research in 
this area is ongoing.  For sites authorized by DFO, 
additional monitoring may be required on a 
site-specific basis.  
 
• Are there monitoring and inventory activities in 
place? 
Finfish 
- Monitoring occurs for environmental effects 
(near-field monitoring is conducted by industry 
and far-field is conducted by DFO Science); 
auditing on-site management includes culture 
methods, species, etc. and is conducted by both the 
provincial and federal governments; on-site water 
quality monotoring, including dissolved oxygen 
levels, is conducted by industry; on-site feed 
monitoring is conducted by industry; on-site fish 
health is monitored by industry; escapes are 
reported to provincial and federal authorities – 
there is an Atlantic salmon watch program that 
monitors for Atlantics in natal systems; wild fish 
health is monitored by DFO/CFIA; sea lice 
abundance is monitored by industry and DFO 
Science; wild fish populations are monitored by 
DFO; CSSP (Canadian Shellfish Sanitation 
Program) monitoring is conduced by Environment 
Canada; research into contaminants and potential 
human health effects is conducted by Health 
Canada.  
- Industry monitors for mortalities in their 
inventory. 
 
Shellfish 
- Government (federal and provincial) provides 
auditing regarding effectiveness of management 
approach. 
- Culture of new species may require provision of 
baseline genetic information (e.g., with geoducks). 
 
• Are there mitigation plans or activities 
underway? 
Finfish 
- Extensive mitigation of harmful effects is required 
for the industry including meeting provincial 
environmental performance standards, contingency 
planning, provincial health plans, siting, best 
management practices, etc.  The finfish industry is 
also required to provide habitat compensation when 
triggered.   
 
Shellfish 
- Conditions of licence, mitigation measures and 
siting are all used to minimize risk to wild fish and 
fish habitat.  
 
• Are there significant ecological and biological 
interactions that can be identified and are they 
given special consideration? 
Please see the State-of-Knowledge report, referenced 
above, for details. 
 
Significance is evaluated on a site-specific basis and 
afforded appropriate management response based on 
the level of residual risk determined.  The Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act screening that is 
conducted for finfish aquaculture sites provides for a 
structured evaluation of the risks.

DFO management of ecological effects:  
• Where an effect cannot be avoided through 
mitigation or design, those residual effects must be 
examined more closely to determine if they are 
negative (some effects can be positive or neutral); 
• When a negative (or potentially negative due to 
uncertainty) residual effect remains, a risk 
management process is used to apply the 
appropriate management option. 
 
 
7. Management of Enhancement Activities 
(species and habitat) 
 
Management objectives: In 1977, backed by strong 
public support, DFO launched the Salmonid 
Enhancement Program (SEP) with the goal of 
stopping and reversing declines in salmon 
populations.  It partnered with the BC MOE, which 
had responsibility for steelhead and cutthroat 
trout.  As well, this government program set a new 
precedent as many British Columbia citizens became 
vital, hands-on partners in the effort.  While DFO 
built major facilities (hatcheries and spawning 
channels), individuals and groups went to work 
cleaning up damaged streams and building small 
incubation boxes. 
 
In a further effort to keep SEP in tune with local 
needs, the Community Economic Development 
Program (CEDP) was initiated in 1977/78, placing 
contracts with community-based groups to operate 
local enhancement projects. 
 
Today, the scope of SEP is varied.  Major hatcheries 
and spawning channels, on some of North America’s 
greatest salmonid-producing rivers, incubate and 
release millions of juveniles each year.  Slightly 
smaller, but effective, are the CEDP projects.  Scientific 
research has contributed another technique: on 
Vancouver Island fertilization of lakes has greatly 
increased the production of sockeye salmon. 
 
In some areas, SEP has turned to smaller 
technologies.  Semi-natural spawning and rearing 
channels that require little or no ongoing staff or 
maintenance are producing fish in remote 
regions.  Fish ladders and fishways provide access for 
spawners to areas once barren of 
salmonids.  Volunteer projects have grown and 
matured.  Besides leaving a legacy of improved 
habitat in many urban areas, these projects often 
produce salmonids from small, genetically-unique 
populations that might otherwise have vanished 
forever.  In addition, every spring many 
neighbourhood creeks receive a few healthy fry that 
have been raised in a classroom by schoolchildren. 
 
Not every project has been successful; many 
individual runs are still threatened by too many 
fishermen and too little habitat.  However, in most 
rivers and streams, salmonids return every fall, as they 
have done for thousands of years. 
 
The report “Pacific Salmon Hatcheries in British 
Columbia” summarizes salmon hatchery approaches

2.3 Japan 
 
2.3.1 Ocean Management Activities 
Relative to Ecosystem-based 
Management 
 
In Japan, fisheries management is conducted on a 
species-by-species basis.  A national definition of 
EBM has not been established, but the Japanese Law 
of the Preservation and Management of Marine 
Biological Resources requires that the government 
should take inter-specific relationships as well as 
other biological or socio-economic factors into 
account when it decides the total allowable catches 
(TACs) of important fishery resources or total 
allowable effort (TAE) for certain fisheries.  Thus, it 
is clear that we should take an ecosystem perspective 
into account.  For that purpose, we are monitoring 
physical environmental factors and marine 
productivity along with the effects of fishery resource 
management (Table 2.3.1). 
 
1. Fishery Management 
 
Coastal fisheries 
 
Fisheries resource management in Japan has been 
basically left to fishermen themselves who are 
licensed by either the national government or local 
  
government.  Self-management or mutual regulation 
has been the traditional style in Japan’s fisheries.  
However, in recent years Western-style fisheries 
management, that is, with management measures 
decided by the government on the basis of science and 
assigned to fishermen using a top-down style, has 
been also adopted in Japan, mostly for offshore 
fisheries. 
 
In coastal fisheries especially, the self-management 
system by fishermen licensed by the government or 
local governments has been effective.  Below, an 
example of a self-resource management system in a 
coastal area is shown, i.e., the sand eel fishery in Ise 
Bay in the central part of Japan.   
 
The sand eel is a cold current fish that has the unique 
characteristic of estivating in summer by digging into 
the sand, except in the northern part of Japan.  The 
duration of estivation in Ise Bay is continuous from 
June to December.  The sand eel spawns in winter 
after estivation.  Fishermen are permitted to catch 
juvenile sand eels from March to May.  They start 
catching from such a young stage because the market 
value is high in this stage.  Sand eel mature one year 
after hatching and adult sand eel are caught in January 
and February.  The core measures for self-management

Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2

of resources are: 
1. Protect spawning fish through preservation of 
habitat during estivation,  
2. Protect larvae and juveniles by establishing a 
closed season, and 
Ensure the proper escapement of sand eels before 
estivation by closing the fishery. 
 
Other appropriate self-management measures for 
target resources are carried out in many places around 
Japan, taking into account the life history of the 
species and the habitats on which they depend. 
 
Offshore fisheries 
 
Off-shore fisheries, such as purse seining, are also 
restricted in fishing effort by a Japanese license 
system that prohibits open access, except for 
small-scale line fishing.  Besides these traditional 
regulations that still exist, fisheries management 
under a TAC approach has been conducted since 1997 
for some fisheries resources in Japanese offshore 
waters.   
 
Fishes managed by TACs in Japan are jack mackerel 
(Trachurus japonicus), Japanese common squid 
(Todarodes pacificus), saury (Cololabis saira), 
sardine (Sardinops melanostictus), chub mackerel 
(Scomber japonicus), spotted mackerel (Scomber 
australasicus), snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio), and 
walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma).    
 
These species inhabit the pelagic warm current 
ecosystem around Japan.  They spawn in the southern 
or middle part off Japan and migrate as far as the 
extent of the mixed water region, that is, to the area 
where the warm current (Kuroshio) and the cold 
current (Oyashio) mix.  Biological reference points 
(BRPs) specific to each species are decided, based 
mainly on spawner–recruitment relationships in 
recent years and the allowable biological catch (ABC), 
which gives a scientific basis of the TAC which is 
calculated using the BRPs for each species.  BRPs are 
set according to the level of each stock of fish.  For 
fish stocks in a low level of abundance and which 
require recovery, the target stock level to recovery is 
determined and a BRP is set to achieve the level 
within a decided timeframe.  For fish stocks in good 
condition, BRPs are usually set to ensure the current 
stock level. 
 
Besides the TAC system, a TAE system has been 
employed since 2003.  TAE  is a management 
measure which sets an upper limit to the fishing effort 
allowed.  Target species under this management 
system are both coastal and offshore species, i.e., 
flathead flounder (Hippogrossoides dubius), sand eel 
(Ammodytes personatus), sharkskin flounder 
(Clidoderma asperrimum), Spanish mackerel 
(Scomberomorus maculatus), tiger puffer (Takifugu 
rubripes), small-mouthed sole (Limanda herzensteini), 
marbled sole (L. yokohamae), slippery (willowy) 
flounder (Tanakius kitaharai) and spear squid (Loligo 
bleekeri). 
 
Resource Recovery Plans developed by the 
government have also been introduced for many 
coastal and offshore resources since 2002.  As of 2006, 
28 plans are being implemented in nearly all fishing 
regions of Japan.  Those plans include measures such 
as: 
1. reduction in fishing effort, 
2. active cultivation of resources through release of 
larval and juvenile fish, 
3. conservation of the fishing ground environment, 
4. ecological properties of the species (e.g., where it 
is on the r-K spectrum, i.e., top predator, 
intermediate predator–prey, prey species). 
 
The warm current ecosystem fish species described 
above, i.e., jack mackerel, Japanese common squid, 
saury, sardine, chub mackerel and spotted mackerel 
feed mainly on zooplankton and are categorized in the 
same ecological niche, i.e., as secondary consumers in 
the marine pelagic ecosystem.  These fishes have 
experienced wide fluctuations in their stock size on 
decadal scales and are indicative of the phenomenon 
that a dominant species is periodically replaced by 
other species over time.  Sequential replacement of 
dominant species has not been explained by 
bottom-up control, so the existence of inter-specific 
relationships among those species is suspected.  By 
this we mean that there is a pathway of sequential 
replacement of dominant species, e.g., ‘usual’ level of 
interannual recruitment variability leads to highly 
variable recruitment interannually which, in turn, 
leads to episodic recruitment and dominant species 
shift (Fig. 2.3.1). 
 
The biomass of  these fish stocks fluctuates widely in 
size on decadal scales.  In the 1930s, sardine was 
dominant among these fishes.  After sardine declined, 
Japanese common squid, saury and jack mackerel 
increased in abundance.  After that, chub mackerel 
increased in abundance in the1960s.  In the 1970s and 
1980s, sardine increased remarkably again and 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 37 
decreased rapidly in the 1990s.  Presently, saury, jack 
mackerel and Japanese common squid are again 
showing relatively high stock size levels. 
 
It is thought that sardine stock size fluctuations, which 
were the most remarkable among those fishes, was 
mainly due to bottom-up controls in the ecosystem, 
accompanied by environmental changes such as a 
regime shift.   
 
- Planned management responses (control rules, 
recovery rules and targets) 
 
The target stock size and B(limit) are set in advance 
for sardine, chub mackerel, jack mackerel and walleye 
pollock. When the stock size of a certain stock falls 
short of its B(limit), F(fishing mortality coefficient) 
will be reduced linearly.  
 
Target reference points for the following fishes in 
2004 are (Table 2.3.2): 
   
 
Table 2.3.2 Target reference points for Japanese fish stocks in 2004. 
Jack mackerel (Pacific stock): F(sus)*

38  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
Measures are taken for bycatch species which can be 
described using a general approach for a 
representative selection of species/groups.  For groups 
which have a propensity to be caught in bycatch, i.e., 
sea turtles and sea birds, we are investigating their 
biology and stock abundance and have developed 
devices to avoid bycatch and have adopted them in 
fisheries.   
 
 
2. Management of Threatened or Protected 
Species and Communities 
 
Our fishery control rule decides that the allowable 
biological catch (ABC) should be zero when the stock 
size falls short of its B(ban).  At present, the stock size 
of the Tsushima Current stock of sardine was nearly 
equal to B(ban) which was decided on a biological 
analysis.  So an ABC for this stock could not be 
described or set.  
 
- Ecological properties of the species or groups  
 
Sardine showed a remarkable fluctuation in catch on 
decadal scales.  This may be due to a fluctuation in the 
mortality rate in early life stages, although the details 
of this  process are not clear. 
 
- Level of natural variability  
 
The stock size could not be estimated precisely in 
recent years because the stock is too small.  Judging 
from several indices, the stock size in recent years 
may be smaller by two orders of magnitude than that 
of 1980s.   
 
- Planned management responses (control rules, 
recovery rules and targets) 
 
The recovery plan for this stock is to prohibit catch 
and increase spawning stock biomass. 
 
 
3. Habitat Management 
 
A few examples are: 
• preservation of habitat used during estivation by 
sand eels in Ise Bay (explained above),  
• preparation of seaweed beds for spawning of 
sailfin sandfish in Akita Prefecture, 
• placing blocks on the the seabed to protect young 
snow crab from trawl fishing in Kyoto Prefecture. 
 
 
4. Community/Trophic Structure Management  
   
Data here describe the approach to management of 
food webs, in general, and of direct feeding 
interactions (predator–prey relationships involving 
the target species), specifically. 
 
This type of management has not been introduced into 
practice yet in Japan.  However, we understand that 
we should be clarifying ecosystem structure and 
quantifying energy flows among ecosystem elements 
and culls from every trophic level to properly preserve 
the diversity of marine ecosystems.  For direct feeding 
interactions (e.g., predator–prey relationships) that 
directly involve the target or other highly valued 
species, we must particularly define these 
interactions. 
 
 
5. Management of the Physical Environment 
(including Freshwater Discharge from Land) 
 
In offshore ecoregions, influences from land for 
ecosystem conditions may be negligible, but we think 
fluctuations in the natural marine environment (the 
strength of the Aleutian Low, El Niño, etc.) are 
important factors influencing the status of offshore 
ecosystems.  Therefore, we are monitoring general 
environmental factors over a long timeframe. 
 
In contrast, we must consider many influences by 
human activities in coastal ecoregions.  Local 
governments, as well as the central government, bear 
the responsibility for their environments and are 
responsible for managing the influence of human 
activities to sustain the environment within a desirable 
status range.   
 
Generally speaking, environmental factors, such as the 
quality of water, have improved as compared with the 
conditions in the 1970s or 1980s, but enviornmental 
changes, e.g., eutrophication, occurrence of red tides or 
oxygen deficient waters, all occur around Japan.   
 
 
6. Management of Contaminants and Pollutants 
 
The permissible amount of contaminants and 
pollutants is established by law and levels are 
monitored by environmental authorities.

7. Management of Aquaculture 
 
The major aquaculture species in Japan are scallops, 
oysters, yellowtail and laver (marine plants). Scallops 
are bivalves which occur in coastal areas of the 
Oyashio current region (cold water).  Wild larvae are 
collected in the sea.  Oysters are found all around 
Japan.  Yellowtail is a piscivorous fish which hatches 
mainly in the East China Sea but is distributed all 
around Japan.  Wild juveniles found under drifting 
seaweeds are the source of fish for their culture.  
Laver is a red algae which occurs in semi-closed 
coastal shallow seas.    
    
- Level of harvest variability 
 
Harvest levels of these species are relatively stable 
(Fig. 2.3.2). 
 
 
8. Management of Enhancement Activities 
 
-  General properties of enhancement activities 
(e.g., stocking or releasing of fry/juveniles, 
constructing artificial reefs, making seaweed 
beds, etc.) 
 
The released fry/juveniles of chum salmon and 
scallops are numerically the most heavily stocked 
species in Japan.  Other major species whose juveniles 
are released for stock enhancement are Japanese 
flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), red sea bream 
(Pagrosomus major) and prawn (Marsupenaeus 
japonicus).

2.4 People’s Republic of China 
 
In China, coastal waters have mostly been fully or 
over-exploited by activities, including fishing and 
mariculture.  High fishing intensity, increasing 
pollution and climate change have caused stock 
depletion of some commercially high-valued, 
large-sized species, and this, combined with 
environmental degradation, has brought attention to 
the loss of marine habitats and frequent outbreaks of 
toxic red tides.  Mariculture also has adverse effects, 
including contamination of the coastal environment 
by fish wastes, pesticides, and antibiotics; spread of 
diseases; and escapement of non-native species.  The 
Chinese government has recognized these problems 
and has promulgated several laws and regulations to 
prevent pollution, both directly in the sea and from 
land-based sources, and has zoned marine areas to 
include rational arrangements for the siting of 
mariculture areas and designation of marine protected 
areas. 
 
For ecosystem-based management (EBM), a better 
understanding of ecosystems is essential. Food web 
dynamics and species interactions have been studied 
in China through the GLOBEC (Global Ocean 
Ecosystem Dynamics) programs in the Bohai Sea, 
Yellow Sea and East China Sea.  Although scientific 
knowledge is still insufficient and the coastal zones, 
especially, were not well included, work has 
progressed.  The effects on the ecosystem from 
releasing species need to be evaluated. In order for 
EBM to be understood by all people and to be more 
operational, socio-economic factors must be 
considered in the establishment of an integrated 
management system.  All management agencies, not 
just those relevant to fisheries, should participate.  
 
 
2.4.1 Agencies Involved in Ocean 
Management 
 
In China, several government agencies are involved in 
regional governance of the Yellow Sea region and 
other marginal seas.  The national government is the 
most important stakeholder in regional environmental 
governance in the ocean, and local governments’ 
involvement is low. The State Oceanic 
Administration has been heavily involved in all ocean 
affairs, except for management of fishery resources 
and fisheries activities which are managed by the 
Ministry of Agriculture.  The State Environmental 
Protection Administration is mostly involved in the 
control of land-based sources of coastal pollution and 
the Ministry of Communications is in charge of 
shipping and harbors.  Therefore, several ministries 
have authorities for ocean issues. 
 
The promulgation and enforcement of the Law of 
Fisheries of the People’s Republic of China in 1986 is 
a milestone in the development of China’s fisheries 
history.  Since that time, Chinese fisheries have been 
in a period of rapid development.  The Law of 
Fisheries prescribes the legal basis for a fishery 
development policy suited to China’s conditions.  
This legislation has been important to the adjustment 
of fisheries activities, and to conservation and rational 
utilization of fishery resources, as fishery 
enforcement capability has been strengthened.  The 
Law of Fisheries was amended in 2000, and a quota 
management approach was determined to be the way 
forward.  In addition, the Law of Marine Environment 
Protection and Law of Sea Use Management were put 
into effect in 2000 and 2002, respectively. 
 
However, due to the effects of global changes and 
increasing human activities, inshore fishery resources 
in Chinese coastal waters have mostly been fully or 
over-exploited.  These fisheries highly depend on a 
market for small-sized, low-valued species.  With the 
development of industrial fisheries and aquaculture 
near coastal populated areas, pollution and habitat 
degradation in the coastal waters is recognized as 
serious.  In addition, the frequent occurrence of 
harmful algae blooms and introduction of non-native 
species through aquaculture and ballast water 
discharges are adversely affecting Chinese coastal 
waters and threaten the health of the ecosystem and its 
biodiversity.  
 
For sustainable utilization of marine living resources 
and maintenance of biodiversity, EBM is necessary 
and it is a management target for Chinese ocean and 
fisheries policies in order to benefit the social 
economy.  EBM of marine fisheries in China is, at the 
least, related to tasks under the jurisdiction of the 
Ministry of Agriculture (fisheries), State Oceanic 
Administration (oceanic affairs excluding fisheries), 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 41 
and State Environmental Protection Administration 
(pollution control).  There is no single governmental 
agency designated to coordinate integrated EBM 
policies.  
 
 
2.4.2 Fisheries Management Measures for 
Ecosystem-based Management 
 
EBM is related to the management and the direct and 
indirect human activities which affect the ocean, 
particularly with respect to fisheries resources. The 
following are management measures for EBM. 
 
1. Output Control –  Based on the existence of high 
fishing pressures and many fishermen, a single 
species total allowable catch (TAC) is not practical 
to enforce at present. 
 
2. Fishing Measures – China has established banned 
fishing areas for motorized trawlers in coastal 
waters, closed seasons and areas for major 
spawning grounds, licensing, minimum mesh sizes, 
and minimum landing size and limits on the 
percentage of bycatch for young fish.  These 
regulations have been in effect since the 1950s. 
 
3. Catch Limits – China has established  a cap (limit) 
on total marine catches since 1999 (zero growth 
policy). 
 
4. Input Control –  In order to reduce fishing effort 
(and by inference, fishing mortality), the Chinese 
government has arranged payment of 270 million 
CNY each year since 2002 to subsidize the 
scrapping of old fishing boats and to encourage 
fishermen to change to alternative employment. 
The number of marine fishing boats is planned to 
be reduced from 222,000 boats in 2002 to less than 
192,000 boats in 2010, with an average reduction 
of 3,750 boats each year.  Meanwhile, the building 
of new fishing boats is strictly controlled. 
5. Summer Fishing Ban –  Since 1995, China has 
completely closed fishing in the Yellow, Bohai 
and East China seas for 2–3 months in the summer. 
In 1999, this ban was extended for 2.5 months in 
the region north of 35ºN, 3 months for south of 
35ºN, and 2 months on the continental shelf of the 
South China Sea.  These measures are effectively 
protecing spawners and juveniles, and catches and 
size of fish caught have observably improved.  
 
6. Mariculture – Mariculture is being managed to 
achieve better distribution of siting relative to 
production and pollution control  
 
7. MPAs – Ten marine protected areas were 
established in 2007.  They are, so far, limited in 
distribution to coastal waters. 
 
8. Stock Rebuilding – To enhance ecosystem health, 
stock enhancement has been in effect for more 
than 20 years.  The main species are high-valued 
species, particularly penaeid shrimp (Penaeus 
chinensis) in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea and East 
China Sea since the mid-1980s.  Other artificially 
hatched juvenile species, such as scallop, abalone 
and jellyfish are also released into coastal waters. 
Since the late 1980s, some artificially hatched 
juvenile fishes have been released, such as red sea 
bream (Pagrosomus major), marbled sole 
(Pseudopleuronectes yokohamae) and redlip 
mullet (Liza haematocheila).  In recent years, 
juvenile large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena 
crocea) have been released in the East China Sea 
to rebuild the depleted stock. Artificial reefs are 
being built in some coastal areas.  
 
9. Monitoring –  Parameters that are being monitored 
in China with respect to fisheries ecosystems are: 
1) relative biomass, species composition, variation 
in mean length, trophic level of the catch, 
size-at-maturity, biophysical characteristics, 
long-term effects on the ecosystem of different 
fisheries management measures, 2) ecological 
effect of enhancement, 3) effectiveness of the 
complete summer ban on the conservation of 
juveniles, and 4) ecosystem benefits, and total 
economic benefit to society.

2.5.1 Ocean Management Activities 
Relative to Ecosystem-based 
Management  
 
Elements of ecosystem-based management (EBM) 
may be 1) sustaining yields, 2) maintaining 
biodiversity, 3) protection from the effects of 
pollution and habitat degradation, and 4) maintaining 
or increasing socio-economic benefits.  Based on 
these elements, initiatives in the spirit of EBM have 
been established in 14 Acts and 15 Presidential and 
Ministerial Orders.  One of the major EBM initiatives 
in Korea is the Basic Act of Ocean and Fisheries 
Development, which describes the maintenance of 
biodiversity in marine ecosystems, and the protection 
and restoration of habitats for marine living resources. 
 
Most of the Korean Acts in the context of EBM are 
focused more on the elements of the maintenance of 
biodiversity and protection from the effects of 
pollution and habitat degradation, rather than on 
sustainability of yields and provision of 
socio-economic benefits.  The Basic Act of the Land 
also describes the conservation of the natural 
ecosystem, including mountains, rivers, lakes, 
estuaries, and oceans, and the mitigation and 
restoration of the ecosystem, based upon 
comprehensive EBM. 
 
 
1. Fishery Management  
 
Korean fisheries have been managed by a variety of 
tools, such as input and output controls and technical 
measurements.  Current initiatives of EBM in Korea 
include the establishment of precautionary total 
allowable catch (TAC)-based fishery management, 
closed fishing seasons/areas, fish size- and 
sex-controls, and fishing gear restrictions. 
 
The general approach to retained species management 
in fisheries is the annual TAC-setting process under a 
precautionary TAC-based fishery management 
system. Recognition of uncertainty and its potential 
consequences have led to the adoption of a 
precautionary approach (PA) in many international 
agreements on fish stocks.  The PA is focused on 
reducing the likelihood of fisheries having adverse 
impacts on marine resources and the host ecosystem. 
Since 2000, Korean fisheries law has made provisions 
for the implementation of a TAC-based fishery 
management system in order to conserve and 
rationally manage fisheries resources in the Korean 
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).  A comprehensive 
monitoring and enforcement program has been 
developed for this management system.  Ten species 
are currently managed under the Korean TAC-based 
fisheries management system: three species of pelagic 
fish (chub mackerel, jack mackerel, Pacific sardine); 
four species of shellfish (pen shell, hen cockle, spiny 
top shell, common squid); and three species of crabs 
(snow crab, red snow crab, blue crab).  The annual 
stock assessment report is prepared by the stock 
assessment scientists of the National Fisheries 
Research and Development Institute (NFRDI) which 
sets the allowable biological catch (ABC) based on 
stock assessment models listed in the order of the 
quality and quantity of information required.  Five 
tiers of information are used to estimate ABC (Zhang 
and Marasco, 2003). In tiers 1 to 3, reference points of 
management are suggested, that is, fishing mortalities 
(F) of F
35%
, F
40%
, and F
0.1.
 In tiers 4 and 5, ABC is 
estimated from the fishery-dependent information, 
that is, time-series catch and effort data.  The ABC 
recommendation from NFRDI is passed directly to the 
TAC Committee of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs 
and Fisheries (MOMAF) for the selection of TACs for 
target species and target fisheries by gears within the 
Korean EEZ, which are determined to be less than or 
equal to the ABCs estimated by stock assessment 
scientists. 
 
Based on the Fishery Act, fishing seasons and fish 
size/weight limits are enacted for 41 species including 
Pacific cod, walleye pollock, and salmon.  In Korea, 
fishing seasons for 24 species during their main 
spawning seasons are closed. Fish size or weight 
regulation is applied for 27 species, based on the 50% 
spawning length or weight of each species.  Both 
fishing seasons and fish size or weight regulations are 
applied for 10 species, including Pacific cod. In July 
2005, MOMAF added 31 species (19 fish, three 
crustacean, two shellfish, five seaweeds, and two 
cephalopods) to the list of fishing seasons and/or fish 
size or weight regulations.  Catch of females of two 
crab species (snow crab and red snow crab) are not 
permitted. 
 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 43 
Restrictions on some fishing gears are enacted, for 
instance, gillnets of more than two layers of netting 
are prohibited in Korean waters.  The sizes of nets and 
meshes are restricted in 19 fisheries.  Gear restrictions 
are set for 18 fisheries to conserve spawning and 
juvenile stocks and their habitats.  The size of offshore 
and coastal fishing vessels is limited in terms of gross 
tonnage.  The number of licenses for five kinds of 
aquaculture farming and set net fisheries is limited by 
fishing gear and area, and the duration of a license is 
limited to 10 years.  Permission to fish is required for 
13 kinds of offshore fishing gears, 16 kinds of coastal 
fishing gears, 10 kinds of deep-sea fishing gears, and 
two kinds of set net; and for seed production fisheries. 
Fishing using trawl, purse seine, gillnet, stow net, and 
dredge net for 12 species is not allowed in coastal 
areas year-round but permitted offshore, based on the 
distance of conventional fishing areas from land.  
 
Zhang et al. (2009) recently developed a pragmatic 
ecosystem-based fisheries risk assessment method for 
Korean fisheries.  This approach was developed to 
measure the risks associated with Korean fisheries 
relative to three different management objectives 
(sustainability, diversity, and habitat quality).  For 
each objective, Zhang et al. (2009) assessed the risk 
of achieving an ecosystem goal by developing 
reference points for each indicator.  Based on this 
information, the study developed pragmatic risk 
indices that were used to assess the status of a 
management unit.  This assessment framework is 
expected to be used for implementing an EBM for 
Korean fisheries in the near future.  
 
 
2. Management of Threatened Protected Species 
and Communities  
 
When an animal species is categorized as an 
endangered species, the Minister of Food, Agriculture, 
Forest and Fisheries (MIFAFF) should take action to 
conserve the animal.  The designation of endangered 
fisheries animals requires consideration of all of the 
following: 1) fisheries animals which are regulated by 
CITES (the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora),  
2) endangered wild fauna and flora, specified by the 
Natural Environment Conservation Act, Article No. 2 
Clauses 6 and 7, and 3) fish species which are 
valuable for protection scientifically, and which are 
requested for protection for research by research 
institutes that are endorsed by the Minister of 
MIFAFF.  The Minister has to announce the 
designated fish species as a protected target species 
according to the above provisions (1) and (2), and 
should conduct proper steps to protect it.  
 
 
3. Habitat Management  
 
The habitats that are used by some or all of the life 
history stages of many species of fish are sometimes 
known, but the habitat utilization does not mean that 
the habitat is obligatory (i.e., that the species must 
have the habitat to successfully carry out its whole life 
cycle).  The mechanistic relationship between a fish 
species at a particular life history stage and the type of 
habitat it occupies should be known for most species 
and life history stages.  It is most critical to understand 
the essential fish habitat inshore, where anthropogenic 
effects on habitat are likely to be most significant.  
 
To ensure the opportunity for the propagation and 
conservation of fisheries resources, spawning and 
nursing areas are protected from fishing in Korea. 
Currently, a total of 10 areas in bays and estuaries 
(1,289 km
2
 of land, 2,542 km
2
 of shore) and 21 areas 
around lakes are regulated by Acts.  To conserve 
biodiversity in wetlands, five areas (141 km
2
) along 
the west coast and seven areas (44.48 km
2
) around 
mountains, lakes and estuaries are designated and 
managed by Acts, and nine more areas along the 
coastline from the west coast to the south coast are 
scheduled to be designated in the near future. 
 
The Korean government is currently developing a 
comprehensive ecosystem-based marine ranching 
program.  This program is designed to carry out the 
enhancement and efficient management of fisheries 
resources, and thus requires an understanding of 
ecological interactions among major species with 
respect to predation, competition for prey species, 
effects of climate on fish ecology, interactions 
between fishes and their habitats, and the effects of 
fishing on fish stocks and their ecosystems.  Based on 
the knowledge and such an understanding, fisheries 
management could avoid significant risks and 
potentially irreversible changes in marine ecosystems 
caused by fishing or marine ranching. The Tongyoung 
Marine Ranching Program has been conducted since 
1998 as a pilot program for a comprehensive EBM in 
Korea.  Currently the marine ranching programs are 
carried out in four other areas: in Gangwon, Taean, 
Jeonnnam, and Jeju.

44  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
4. Community/Trophic Structure Management  
 
Recently, research projects for developing a 
management plan considering trophodynamic 
relationships in marine ecosystems were initiated in 
Korea.  These are some marine ranching ecosystem 
management projects, such as Tongyoung, the 
Jeonnam Archipelago area, and three other marine 
ranching areas, which aim to understand the structure 
and function of an ecosystem using the 
Ecopath/Ecosim model.  This kind of research is still 
at the beginning stages, and these projects will be 
gradually extended in Korea. 
 
 
5. Management of Physical Environment 
(including Freshwater Discharge from Land)  
 
Ecosystem monitoring in the East China Sea takes 
place where the construction of the Changjiang River 
dam has been conducted to understand how changes 
in freshwater discharge off the land can influence 
coastal and offshore fish populations and their 
ecosystem around the Korean Peninsula. The study 
area of this monitoring includes geophysical, 
chemical, and biological oceanographic 
characteristics and ecological modeling. 
  
 
6. Management of Contaminants and Pollutants  
 
Contaminants and pollutants have been managed by 
the Basic Act of Environment Policy (BAEP) since 
1980. The management regions are categorized into 
river, pond and lake, and ocean.  The management 
targets are based on eight standards measurements of 
the environment including pH, BOD, COD, DO, total 
nitrogen, and nine standards related to the protection 
of human health, including Cd, As, CN, Hg, and PCBs. 
The classification of river, pond and lake quality using 
five levels of freshwater quality, and as a system for 
the ocean using three levels of ocean water quality is 
monitored by an integrated coastal environment 
management system.  For the preservation of a clean 
and safe ocean environment with systematic 
water-quality control, sea areas for special 
environmental management will be expanded from 
nine areas in 2000 to 30 areas in 2010.  MIFAFF has 
tried to conserve coastal ecosystems by mapping 
estuaries and by providing necessary laws to create 
wetland conservation areas.  NFRDI has continuously 
developed techniques to prevent or mitigate the 
effects of red tides.  Moreover, NFRDI tries to make 
the ocean environment cleaner and safer by 
formulating a national contingency plan against oil 
spills, and by establishing a comprehensive marine 
traffic management network.  
 
 
7. Management of Aquaculture  
 
The total size of aquaculture areas is about 122 
kilohectares (kha) and that of seaweed culture areas is 
68 kha, accounting for 55.8% of the total area of 
aquaculture.  Current cultured species number about 
50, including seaweeds, flounder, rockfish, oysters, 
clams, shrimps, scallops, and abalone.  Management 
activities of aquaculture are focused on the 
development of aquaculture species in order to meet 
the demand of the global fish market and sustainable 
production, and to follow the global market system, 
such as World Trade Organization/Doha 
Development Agenda (WTO/DDA) and Free Trade 
Agreement (FTA).  Development of new aquaculture 
species is strictly banned and renewing the expired 
licenses of aquaculture is very limited. 
 
 
8. Management of Enhancement Activities  
 
In Korea, construction of artificial reefs is aimed at 
improving productivity of devastated fishing grounds 
by providing fish resources with habitats, and 
spawning and nursery grounds.  Since 1971, 2,818 
fishing grounds have been augmented, with artificial 
reefs covering a total area of 168 kha, requiring an 
investment of 550 billion Won, as of 2003.  A total of 
55% of the area with artificial reefs is utilized as 
fishing grounds and the other 45% is preserved for 
fisheries.  In terms of construction area by sea region, 
the area off the East Coast of Korea accounts for 
25.8%, off the West Coast, 19.4% and off the South 
Coast, 54.8%, i.e., more than half of the artificial reefs 
were laid off the South Coast.  
 
In Korea, construction projects for seaweed culture 
enhancement started in 2002.  The project spent 3.49 
billion Won from 2002 to 2004.  In 2005, the Fisheries 
Resources Enhancement Center of NFRDI conducted 
a preliminary experiment in three provinces 
(Gangwon, Kyungbuk, Jeju) for three years, investing 
three billion Won each year to the seaweed bed 
project (Jeon, 2004).  
 
Since 1998, NFRDI has developed seed production 
technology to release strong juveniles of rockfish and 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 45 
sea bream. Seed production has successfully 
enhanced fishery resources and increased the incomes 
of fishermen.  In the early stages of seed production, 
national facilities took the lead to develop techniques, 
but private companies produce the seed currently.  A 
total of 19 species, such as abalone, flatfish, sea bream 
and sea slug, are targets to be produced and a total of 
203 million juveniles of all species have been stocked 
in the sea.  A total of 19 million juveniles of horseshoe 
crab, carp, crucian carp and another seven species 
were stocked in inland waters (Jeon, 2004).

2.6 Russia 
 
2.6.1 Ecosystem-based Principles in 
Contemporary Fisheries 
Management in the Russian  
Far East 
 
This paper consists of three parts. First, is a general 
characterization of contemporary Russian fisheries 
made with special attention given to the Russian Far 
East.  The total allowable catch (TAC) setting system 
is briefly described and catch values for recent years 
are presented.  Attention is also paid to legislation and 
problems derived from its implementation in fisheries 
management.  
 
The second part deals with the ecosystem studies of 
marine biological resources.  Using the recent 
literature review by Professor V. Shuntov et al. (2007), 
contemporary results and understandings of fishery 
stock dynamics are presented.  These create a good 
basis for the current ecosystem-based principles in 
Russia.  
 
The third part is devoted to fishery rules in the Far 
Eastern Basin, based on a new 2007 document.  On 
one hand, this document is a fundamental basis for 
future developments in this field.  On the other hand, 
it is also changeable like the famous “soft watches” 
painted by Salvador Dali. [Author’s note:  “Soft 
watches” – an allegory presented by Salvador Dali in 
his famous 1931 painting “The Persistence of 
Memory” to indicate that things may not be as rigid as 
usually assumed (Garcia and Charles, 2007).]  Four 
significant changes were made in this code of rules in 
2008 and more may be forthcoming.   
 
 
2.6.2 Ecosystem Approaches to 
Management 
  
First, it is necessary to characterize Russian fisheries 
and fishery management zones.  Four Fisheries 
Management Region ( FMR) patterns (gradually 
becoming more complex) were established in the 
former USSR in 1975, 1980, 1988 and 1989.  Each of 
these patterns corresponded to the specific period in 
development of understandings about fishery 
management tasks.  The first pattern (1975) 
corresponded to the time before the establishment of 
vast exclusive economic zones (EEZs) by coastal 
countries.  The second and third patterns were 
established under the influence of the potential 
fisheries area limitation imposed by the newly formed 
EEZs.  The most recent FMR pattern (1989) 
introduced further detailed elaboration (Fig. 2.6.1).  
 
Actual removals of fisheries resources, i.e., fishery 
harvest or catch, are influenced by a range of factors 
which are not always taken into account (e.g., size of 
fishing fleet, control and enforcement of the 
regulations, industry investments, and markets for the 
commodities produced).  Management is largely 
through effort control, and enforcement is in place.  
Additional data on the ecosystem, and to some extent, 
information on the impact of fisheries, is sometimes 
provided and occasionally fleet information is given 
as well (Hoydal, 2007). 
 
Traditional fishing areas of the Soviet expeditionary 
fishery period at the end of 1980s were found in all the 
world’s oceans.  Russia was the biggest player in the 
global fisheries economy with an annual harvest of 
more than 11 million metric tons (mt).  These indices 
are still in wide use now as a kind of target reference 
level when the national fisheries outlook is discussed.  
Even now, the biggest expectations for Russian 
fisheries still relate to the expeditionary fishery in 
open oceanic waters. 
 
In reality, the Russian fishing fleet has retreated to 
Russia’s own EEZ, yet the number of vessels has 
increased by 13.7% since 1990.  At the same time, the 
grand total fisheries harvest by national fisheries has 
decreased by a factor of 3.5 times below the peak 
level in 1960.  The main causes for these changes, 
besides the reduction of fishing in foreign waters, are 
higher fuel prices, the breaking up of fisheries 
ventures, and difficult business conditions, including 
the institution of administrative barriers and high 
transportation tariffs.  These factors have resulted in 
the fishery harvest being largely exported, i.e., 
redistributed from the domestic market in interior 
regions to the nearest foreign markets where higher 
prices are being paid.  The services and repair base of 
the fishery fleet, material supplies, and banking 
facilities have followed the ‘escaped’ fleet that is 
delivering its catch in foreign markets; fishery 
ventures have also obtained their supplies and 
services in ports outside Russia.  The annual average 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 47 
of Russia’s consumption of fishery products has 
decreased from 22 kg per person to 10–12 kg. 
 
Relatively few species contribute to the bulk of the 
total fishery harvest in the Russian Far East: in 
1989–1990, walleye pollock contributed up to 
2,930,000–3,120,000 mt; Japanese sardine, or iwashi, 
contributed up to 734,900–762,200 mt in 1989–1990.   
 
Other important fish in the Russian Far East are Pacific 
herring (Clupea pallasii) and Pacific salmon 
(Oncorhynchus sp.), with pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) 
accounting for the biggest landing.  In 2007, the 
Russian fishery harvest of pink salmon reached a level 
of 250,000 mt for the second time in recent history. 
Several other species have a regional significance: 
Commander squid (Berryteuthis magister) and Pacific 
saury for the oceanic waters, and Pacific cod (Gadus 
macrocephalus) and flatfish in the Bering Sea.   
 
When walleye pollock catches decrease below the 
range 1,016,000–1,211,000 mt, the total fishery 
harvest on the Russian Far East shows a significant 
decrease (1,970,000–2,150,000 mt in 2006–2007). 
The significance of this is reflected in the analysis of 
fisheries gear in use.  About 76.3% of the total fishery 
harvest was caught by trawls in 2005, with trawls the 
primary method used to catch walleye pollock.  Beach 
seines and stationary traps are the main gears in the 
Pacific salmon fishery.  Saury is caught using both 
liftnets and Dutch seines. Pot fisheries also account 
for landings by gear.   
 
The contemporary legislative basis for Russian 
fisheries management was developed in 2003.  Prior 
to this time, some temporary Acts, instructions, and 
guidelines were in force. Planning for fisheries 
development in the Russian Federation until 2020 and 
Procedure of Biological Resources Usage (approved 
by the Russian Government Resolution No. 704 of 
20.11.2004 regarding quotas for aquatic biological 
resources) have established a basis of long-term 
(five-year) quota allocations between fishery ventures. 
The federal law on Fisheries and Water Biological 
Resources Conservation was signed on December 20, 
2004.  Its realization required 30 more legislative 
documents, including 15 governmental resolutions.  
Among other statements, this federal law 
strengthened the main principle of contemporary 
Russian fisheries management: annual TAC setting 
  
 
Fig. 2.6.1 Fishery management regions and responsibility zones of regional inspections. 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2 
48  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
for target fisheries.  However, there was neither 
emphasis in this law nor in the governmental 
resolution after its issue (No. 583 of September 26, 
2005) that the TAC principle is obligatory for all 
marine biological resources, as it was in the 
documents previously enacted by the Duma.  Then, 
the Russian federal agency on fisheries issued an 
order (No. 219 of October, 2, 2008) approving a list of 
water biological resources, which will be further 
managed by the TAC principle. 
 
In summary: 
• The legislative basis for the Russian Far East 
fisheries is still being reformed.  The basic 
principles predicated on current statements about 
reforms are long-term quota allocations for fishery 
ventures, negotiation of administrative barriers, 
and strict poaching control. 
• The annual TAC setting procedure has some 
benefits for fisheries, as it compelled fisheries 
managers to undertake a comprehensive review of 
all commercial species and stocks, i.e., it: 
 - ensured a unified approach and centralized 
management of all biological resources;  
 - made preconditions for objective rules of quota 
allocations; and 
 - cut down the number of users of marine 
biological resources which had become 
excessive and had led to deterioration of the 
most valuable fishery stocks.  
 
This allows the formation of new approaches for 
tax collection from biological resource usage 
instead of the previous procedure, i.e., when 
fishery rights were being auctioned off.  However, 
the aggressive development of the TAC setting 
and the TAC limitation approach also led to 
negative consequences, such as bycatch discard 
problems, deterioration of fishery statistics, and 
new obstacles to the optimization of fishery 
management.  These were the main reasons to 
abolish TAC settings for all fisheries since 2009. 
 
 
2.6.3 Ecosystem Studies 
 
Russian fishery science has identified 374 fishery 
stocks in 11 fishery zones (note:  three zones (61.06.1, 
61.06.3 and 61.06.4; see Figure 2.6.1) are divided 
internally but are in fact managed as a single zone, 
thus giving the appearance of there being 14 zones) 
and sub-zones in the Far East, excluding the Chukchi 
Sea and freshwater.  An annual TAC setting is 
executed for each of these stocks. The largest number 
of stocks (52) is in the Primorie fishery sub-zone, and 
the smallest (22) is in the Northern Kurils  
zone.  The total average TAC for these regions was 
3,207,500 mt for the 2003–2007 five-year period. The 
Sakhalin Research Institute of Fisheries and 
Oceanography (SakhNIRO) is responsible for a 
significant part of this area.  Pelagic fish contribute to 
a large proportion of the total TAC as well as to the 
total harvest.  In contrast, pelagic squid and kelp 
resources in the southernmost zones are probably 
being underestimated. Some resources of mysids, 
jellyfishes and tunicates occur but they are relatively 
small. 
 
 
2.6.4 Science for Ecosystem Approach to 
Management 
 
The summary below demonstrates the long-term 
forecast capability of fishery stock conditions as a 
result of ecosystem studies of biological resources.  
These forecasts are based on our understanding of 
element relationships with respect to ecosystem 
trophic structure: common species of pelagic and 
groundfish, benthos, and plankton.  The main theses 
under consideration are briefly listed.      
 
Russian fishery science has completed an inventory of 
the aquatic biological resources in the pelagic layer of 
the Far Eastern seas with publication of a series of 
“Atlases of nekton distribution” (Shuntov and 
Bocharov, 2003a, 2004a, 2005a, and 2006a) in the Far 
Eastern seas and adjacent Pacific waters, and volumes 
of quantitative data as references for these atlases 
named “Nekton distribution” in the same years 
(Shuntov and Bocharov, 2003b, 2004b, 2005b, and 
2006b).  The database for these eight volumes 
includes results of 22,200 trawl hauls during research 
cruises.  This will be an important database for future 
comparative monitoring and consideration in the 
development of fishery management advice. 
 
According to forecasts from the Pacific Research 
Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (TINRO- 
Center), the fisheries harvest in the Far Eastern seas 
could reach 3.8 million mt by 2015.  This is less than 
the historical high of 5 million mt of 1988 but about 1 
million mt higher than the level of 2.48 million mt in 
2009.  Realization of this forecast depends on several 
factors:  
• general socio-economical conditions in the Far 
Eastern region,  
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 49 
• fishery management improvement and 
optimization, 
• scientific and technical assessment activities, 
• demand for utilization of currently unfished and 
under-fished resources (e.g., mesopelagic fish, 
pelagic squids, marine mammals, small bivalves, 
kelp, jellyfish),  
• abundance dynamics of common pelagic fish (e.g., 
walleye pollock, sardine, herring, Pacific salmon). 
 
From the ecosystem study results, Shuntov et al. 
(1997) forecasted a decrease of total nekton biomass 
as well as biological and fishery productivity in the 
early 1990s, with further stabilization at a lower level 
in the first years of the present century. These 
predictions have been realized. Long-term dynamics 
of pelagic nekton distribution in the biostatistical 
areas in the Far Eastern seas resulted in a landing 
decrease in the first half of 1990s and then some 
recovery in most recent years, with the northeastern 
and eastern parts of Russian EEZ recently 
contributing the greatest amount of catch.  
 
Biomass declines in the Far East are mostly 
attributable to decreases in pelagic fish.  Pelagic squid 
abundance subesquently increased because of a 
reduction in both predation pressure and competition 
for food.  Current high indices of pelagic squid 
abundance suggest that pelagic fish abundance is still 
far below the level of the 1980s.   
 
Recent results, however, suggest future growth in 
abundance of other common commercial fishery 
species.  The present understanding divides herring in 
the northern Sea of Okhotsk into two stocks.  These 
stocks are generally fished under catch limits in two 
adjacent fishery zones, with notably different allowed 
catches.  In recent years, some portion of the 
under-fished Gizhigin-Kamchatsky herring stock was 
allowed to be caught in the Northern Okhotsk zone, 
together with the Okhotsk herring stock.  However, 
each stock did not respond similarly to fishery effort 
and now it is believed that the herring population in 
the northern Sea of Okhotsk has a more complicated 
structure, represented by three stocks instead two. 
This will require changes in fishery management.    
 
Recent Pacific herring catch dynamics closely repeat 
the previous period of intensive fishing during the 
1960s–1970s, despite different fishery gears and 
methods in those times.  It is well known that Pacific 
herring resources undergo significant predation 
pressure, and that herring are sensitive to spawning 
conditions.  Herring stocks respond to climate change, 
as evidenced during the mid-1970s after the 
well-recognized 1977 regime shift. 
 
Walleye pollock in the Sea of Okhotsk demonstrate an 
expected spawning stock stabilization and gradual 
growth. Some peripheral regional spawning 
groupings of pollock show higher rates of abundance 
growth than the core stock in the western Kamchatka 
and northern Okhotsk fisheries areas.  The TAC in the 
Eastern Sakhalin fishery sub-zone increased seven 
times during a relatively short period (2006–2008, 
from 5000 to 35,000 mt).  It has continued to increase, 
with TAC of 50,000 mt in 2010 and 82,000 mt 
projected for 2011.  Fisheries there are more intensive 
after the spawning period, which is promising in 
relation to a proposed division of pollock fishing into 
two seasons.   
 
Pacific salmon marine life has been well studied by 
dozens of expeditions from 1990 to the present.  Data 
now allow the TINRO-Center to construct an annual 
pattern of Pacific salmon residence in the Russian 
EEZ.  The Sea of Okhotsk is the main forage ground 
for pink and chum salmon juveniles, while the Bering 
Sea is for larger salmon.  In recent years, pink salmon 
catches reached new records for the period after the 
middle of the last century, even in the odd years.  This 
may be, in part, because the success of pink salmon 
hatchery production has smoothed total annual 
salmon production by providing practically the same 
numbers of annual juvenile as from natural spawning.  
In any case, these data testify to recent good 
conditions for pink salmon survival during their 
marine stage.   
 
Results of benthic TINRO-Center surveys suggest an 
interaction level between the benthic and pelagic 
ecosystems.  A comparison of recent results with the 
estimates of benthos abundance in the 1970s–1980s 
does not reveal large differences. Shuntov (2001) 
considered that average benthos biomass varied 
among the Far Eastern shelf areas between 300–500 g 
m
2
, and that the benthos biomass contained forage 
benthos for groundfish.  Annual benthos consumption 
by groundfish was estimated to range from 30– 129 g 
m
2
 in the various regions, including a part of the 
nekton-benthic species, so fish consumption of 
benthos appear to have a relatively minor influence on 
benthic biomass dynamics.  
 
Food competition among groundfish does not, 
therefore, appear to reach a level where it could be a 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2 
50  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
limiting factor for their abundance.  Formation of 
groundfish year class strength occurs in the early 
ichthyoplanktonic stages when groundfish roe and 
larvae exist in the same habitat with the early stages of 
pelagic fish and bottom invertebrates, and with 
zooplankton, including predatory species.  Another 
issue is that some groundfish species consume the 
juvenile stages of other commercially valuable 
species, e.g., Pacific cod eat juvenile walleye pollock, 
shrimp and snow crabs.  On the western Kamchatka 
shelf, such consumption was estimated at 100,000 mt 
of shrimp and 11,000 mt of snow crabs annually.  That 
is higher than the TACs for these groups.  Thus it 
seems to be sensible to keep the Pacific cod stock at 
the lower edge of its optimal size to prevent excessive 
predation upon other commercial fishery targets.  A 
similar situation exists with the large sculpin species, 
snailfish, and skates, which are practically unfished 
now.  Sculpins and skates were targeted but their 
fishery now has a low intensity due to low market 
prices.  Snailfish are untargeted.  Greater fishing for 
these lower unit value predators, with a subsequent 
lowering of their abundances, may thus help increase 
higher unit value fishery resources.  
 
With respect to ecosystem studies, the following is 
observed:  
• Most stocks of biological resources in the Far 
Eastern seas and adjacent Pacific waters remain in 
satisfactory and/or good condition.  The resource 
base of the Russian fishery consists of numerous 
species and types of resources, some of which are 
under-utilized.    
• The main factors affecting biological and fishery 
productivity of the Far Eastern seas are natural 
ones, i.e., biotic and physical.  Data from 
ecosystem status monitoring show a cyclic nature 
of many natural processes, with different (often 
hidden) periodicity.  Regular monitoring is 
necessary.   
• Consideration of global and large-scale physical 
factors may be insufficient for analysis of 
processes in marine populations and communities 
in individual seas and smaller areas.  Local 
(provincial) conditions can affect them to a greater 
degree than global ones. 
 
 
2.6.5 Fisheries Regulation 
 
With respect to the fishery regulation procedure 
established by new legislative Acts, the Fisheries 
Rules for the Far Eastern Basin (hereinafter referred 
to as Fishery Rules) was signed on March 1, 2007. 
This document deals with all seven  kinds of fishery 
target removals from the marine environment, i.e.,  
the commercial fisheries in the territorial waters, on 
the continental shelf, and in the EEZ. 
 
The Fishery Rules have established 54 permanent and 
three seasonal area closures for commercial fisheries 
for all species: three closures are for trawls, one is for 
bottom gillnets, and others are for all gears for vessels 
whose total length is geater than 24 m.  There are 
exceptions for shorter fishery vessels conducting 
coastal fisheries, and four which exempt Pacific 
salmon and kelp harvesting.  There are additional area 
closures for some species: e.g., nine for walleye 
pollock, two for holothurians, and one or two for each 
of the eight crab species.  Many of these limitations 
protect marine mammals’ rockeries and the forage 
grounds around them, as well as some valuable 
bottom biotopes which are protected from the 
negative influence of the bottom trawl fishery.  
 
The Fishery Rules have established 44 seasonal 
fishery closures that deal with 20 species and groups 
of fishery targets.  Most of the closed areas protect 
spawning and early development of commercial 
species.  Other closures are efforts to restrict 
large-scale fisheries to the most profitable period 
(time with the highest catch per unit efforts) to reduce 
the total effects of a fleet presence on ecosystems.  
When a fishery quota is realized in the shortest time 
period, the fleet’s environmental impact, because of 
its discards, noise and wastes on the marine ecosystem, 
also occurs over a shorter time.   
 
The Fishery Rules have established 26 prohibitions 
and limitations that deal with fishing gears and 
method of catch, such as restriction in the crab fishery 
of any gear except specially equipped pots.  These 
measures protect fishery stocks from overfishing and 
they may reduce the juvenile and non-target bycatch. 
These rules also prohibit the hunting of marine 
mammals, excluding seals, by nets, traps, seines, and 
rifles, and there is a requirement for vessels being 
used to have a winch, ropes, etc. to ensure the 
immediate extraction of killed animals from the water.  
Loss of marine mammal bodies in the sea is 
prohibited and is regarded as polluting.  A minimal 
distance of beach traps from spawning rivers for 
Pacific salmon is also established. 
 
The Fishery Rules have also established legal fishery 
size limitations for 85 fishery targets, including local 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 51 
populations of the same species.  It is interesting that 
this section of Rules has an individual species focus, 
which is not implemented in TAC setting 
requirements and in fishery landing reporting.  In the 
TAC setting procedure and fishery statistics, all small 
flatfish species are supposed to be grouped and 
reported together, irrespective of the actual species 
composition in the catch.  However, the new Fishery 
Rules separate starry flounder, Alaska plaice, 
longhead dab, Sakhalin sole, and other species.    
 
Permitted fishery bycatch regulated by TAC settings 
is limited to 2% in weight (excluding marine 
mammals, crabs, and shrimp), and to a maximum 8% 
in number for undersized individuals in all specialized 
fisheries.  While this standard has also been called for 
in previous legislation, a new aspect is that the 
permitted bycatch of non-target species, for which 
TACs have not been established, is limited to 49% of 
total harvest weight.  These non-target species include 
e.g., mesopelagic fish, lumpsuckers, and poachers and 
usually are discarded.  New limitations in the Fishery 
Rules serve as a conservation measure for these 
species and for fish communities as a whole.  It 
prohibits a fishery by non-selective gears in areas 
where non-target species are spawning, overwintering 
or are otherwise aggregated.   
 
Nevertheless, the TAC system based on single-stock 
approaches fails to account for interactions between 
different stocks caught together in the same fishery.  
Continuation of fisheries for one species may 
undermine conservation targets for another and lead 
to increased discarding.  Mixed fishery considerations 
need to be included in setting annual TACs (Penas, 
2007).  
 
In summary:  
• Different fishery regulation methods are widely 
applied in the fishery management in the Russian 
Far East.  A TAC setting for all fishery targets and 
every fishery is not an optimal approach.  This 
situation can hopefully be changed through 
prioritization of fishery regulation measures for 
different fishery types (e.g., the trawl fishery on 
common pelagic fishes, coastal groundfish, etc.), 
and a transition from single-species management 
to multiple species-type regulations;   
• Russian fishery science possesses comprehensive 
knowledge on fishery resources composition, 
stock abundance and dynamics. Permanent 
multipurpose monitoring is necessary to improve a 
long-term forecasting; 
• Russian Far East fisheries currently possess all the 
preconditions for successful application of basic 
ecosystem-based principles.

2.7.1 Definition of the Ecosystem Approach 
to Fisheries Management 
 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA), the primary ocean research 
agency of the U.S., has defined an ecosystem 
approach to fisheries management as one that is 
geographically specified, adaptive, takes account of 
ecosystem knowledge and uncertainties, considers 
multiple external influences, and strives to balance 
diverse societal objectives.  Implementation will need 
to be incremental and collaborative.  Sissenwine and 
Murawski (2004) formally introduced this definition, 
and elaborated further on its components.  The 
geographic specification should be scaled 
hierarchically according to the processes being 
studied or managed.  The approach should account for 
several high-priority issues that have not traditionally 
been monitored in fishery management programs, 
namely bycatch and fishery interactions, indirect 
effects of harvest, and interactions between biotic and 
abiotic ecosystem components.  Finally, this approach 
is ideally an inclusive, integrative process that 
accounts for the needs and interests of a diverse set of 
stakeholders throughout society, and helps those 
stakeholder groups to understand and anticipate both 
the costs and benefits of sustainable marine resource 
management. 
 
 
2.7.2 Overview of Fisheries Management 
Implementation at the Federal Level 
 
Management of fisheries in federal waters of the U.S. 
is governed by several federal Acts that extend 
protection to fish, seabirds, marine mammals, 
endangered species, and the coastal zone.  Most 
significant is the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) 
passed in 1976, amended in 1996 by the Sustainable 
Fisheries Act and again in 2007 (http:// 
www.nmfs.noaa.gov/msa2007).  Implementation of 
the requirements of the MSFCMA by the North 
Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC) is 
aided by national standard guidelines 
(http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/refm/stocks/nsgfinal.pdf).   
 
The MSFCMA explicitly provides for institution of 
key components of ecosystem-based fisheries 
management.  It contains standards and provisions 
that relate maintaining or rebuilding the productivity 
and economic benefits of fisheries to broader suites of 
ecological interactions and ecosystem processes 
extending beyond single-species considerations.  
Some examples are described in the following 
paragraphs. 
 
National Standard 9, added to the MSFCMA in 1996, 
states that “conservation and management measures 
shall, to the extent practicable, (A) minimize bycatch 
and (B) to the extent bycatch cannot be avoided, 
minimize the mortality of such bycatch.”  This 
standard gave rise to a federal plan for managing 
bycatch (http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/bycatch.htm).  
The MSFCMA defines bycatch as “fish which are 
harvested in a fishery, but which are not sold or kept 
for personal use, and includes economic discards and 
regulatory discards…[but not] fish released alive 
under a recreational catch and release fishery 
management program.” 
 
The MSFCMA calls for direct action to stop or 
reverse the continued loss of fish habitats.  Congress 
mandated the identification of habitats essential to 
managed species and measures to conserve and 
enhance these habitats.  The MSFCMA requires 
cooperation among NOAA, the councils, fishing 
participants, and federal and state agencies to protect, 
conserve, and enhance essential fish habitat (EFH) to 
the extent that is practicable.  The amended 
MSFCMA requires NOAA to minimize damage to 
EFH from fishing practices, to the extent practicable.  
Federal agencies that authorize, fund, or conduct 
activities that “may adversely affect” EFH must work 
with NOAA to develop measures that minimize 
damage to EFH.  Federal agencies proposing to 
dredge or fill habitats in or near EFH, for instance, 
must consult with NOAA to develop EFH 
conservation measures if the action may adversely 
affect EFH.  While NOAA does not have veto 
authority over federal projects adversely affecting 
EFH, this mandate enables NOAA to provide 
guidance to federal action agencies on ways to tailor 
 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2 
54  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
their projects to minimize harm to EFH.  By requiring 
the consideration of impacts on EFH from both 
fishing and non-fishing activities, the MSFCMA 
ensures that NOAA takes a more holistic approach to 
fish habitat protection.  Laws and regulations on EFH 
can be found at http://www.habitat.noaa.gov/ 
protection/index.html. 
 
The MSFCMA approach to management of food 
webs, in general, and of predator–prey relationships 
involving target species, has several facets.  First, the 
MSFCMA defines optimum yield (OY) as the amount 
of fish that will provide the greatest overall benefit to 
the nation, particularly with respect to food 
production and recreational opportunities, and taking 
into account the protection of marine ecosystems.  An 
OY is prescribed on the basis of the maximum 
sustainable yield (MSY) from the fishery, as reduced 
by any relevant economic, social, or ecological factor.  
Examples of ecological factors are given in the 
National Standard guidelines and include 
predator–prey or competitive interactions, and 
dependence of marine mammals and seabirds or 
endangered species on a stock of fish.  Thus, fishery 
managers are given direction in modifying maximum 
biological yield targets to account for ecological 
factors such as predator–prey relationships.   
 
An even broader piece of legislation than the 
MSFCMA is the National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA; http://ceq.hss.doe.gov).  NEPA governs the 
actions of federal fisheries managers by requiring 
public officials to make decisions that are based on an 
understanding of environmental consequences, and 
take actions that protect, restore, and enhance the 
environment. 
 
Another relevant piece of legislation is the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act (MMPA; see http:// 
www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/laws/mmpa/text.htm).  The 
MMPA establishes a federal responsibility to 
conserve marine mammals, with a goal of obtaining 
an optimum sustainable population of marine 
mammals within the carrying capacity of the habitat.  
If a fishery affects a marine mammal population, then 
the potential impacts of the fishery must be analyzed 
in an environmental assessment or environmental 
impact statement required by NEPA.  No directed 
harvest may occur on any marine mammal, regardless 
of their population status.  However, the MMPA 
allows for a limited incidental ‘take’ that must be less 
than the potential biological removal (PBR) rate, the 
maximum level of incidental mortality that still allows 
the species to attain its optimum sustainable 
population (http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/prot_res/PR2/ 
Fisheries_Interactions/TRT.htm). The MMPA further 
establishes management for cetaceans and pinnipeds 
(by NOAA) and sea otters (by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service) and requires regular stock 
assessments of all populations.  Mammals whose 
population status is depleted receive protections that 
may include restrictions on fishing in their habitats or 
on fish species that they prey upon. 
 
Legislation comparable to the MMPA has been 
passed for other species groups as well.  The 
Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA; http://laws.fws.gov/ 
lawsdigest/migtrea.html), forbids the directed take of 
seabirds.  The Endangered Species Act (ESA; 
http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/laws/esa/) provides 
protection for fish and wildlife species that are listed 
as threatened or endangered.   
 
Other significant legislation deals with issues of water 
quality and coastal management.  A major 
overarching piece of legislation is the Coastal Zone 
Management Act (CZMA; http://laws.fws.gov/ 
lawsdigest/coaszon.html) which mandates that 
federally managed activities in coastal waters be 
consistent, to the maximum extent possible, with 
coastal zone management policies adopted by the 
states possessing the coastline.  A wide range of local, 
state, and federal laws are in place that set standards 
for levels of point and non-point pollution (e.g., 
http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wq/nonpoint/index
.html).  Reflecting research which demonstrated that 
increased nutrient levels can lead to harmful algal 
blooms (HABs), Congress passed the Harmful Algal 
Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act in 
1998 (http://www.cop.noaa.gov/pubs/habhrca/1998_ 
pl105-383.pdf), and amended and reauthorized it in 
2004 (http://www.cop.noaa.gov/pubs/habhrca/2004_ 
publ456.108.pdf).  This Act created a coalition of 
federal agencies to assess the ecological and 
economic impacts of HABs, bloom-derived toxins, 
and bloom-related hypoxic conditions.  Action plans 
have been developed for HAB species associated with 
fish kills, human shellfish consumption warnings, and 
marine mammal and seabird mortalities.  
Vessel-based dumping of materials into waters of the 
U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is regulated 
under the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and 
Control Act (MARPOL) (http://www.csc.noaa.gov/ 
opis/html/summary/mpprca.htm) and the Marine 
Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act  
(http://epw.senate.gov/mprsa72.pdf).  The latter 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 55 
legislation, passed in 1972 and amended in 2000, 
includes regulatory language for dumping of dredge 
spoils which often contain contaminated sediments. 
 
Below, we offer two case studies that illustrate the 
practice of U.S. ocean management under the laws 
listed above.  We also outline some basic interactions 
between the federal government, regional fishery 
management councils, states, and other agencies, 
organizations and stakeholder groups.  We offer two 
case studies from the U.S., in part, because the U.S. 
EEZ in the PICES region spans from the Eastern 
Pacific to the extreme north, and thus presents 
geographically and ecologically contrasting systems 
that are managed under a relatively common 
framework. 
 
 
2.7.3 Case Study 1:  Eastern Bering Sea 
 
Ocean Management Activities 
 
Alaska ocean management activities occur in a large 
area encompassing southeast Alaska, Gulf of Alaska, 
Aleutian Islands, Eastern Bering Sea, and the 
Chukchi/Beaufort seas in the Arctic.  The Eastern 
Bering Sea is a large focus for many of the ocean 
management activities.  The Bering Sea is a 
semi-enclosed high-latitude sea with a deep basin 
(3,500 m), and shallow (<200 m) continental shelves. 
The broad shelf in the east contrasts with a narrow 
shelf in the west.  In summer on the eastern shelf, 
coastal, middle, and outer domains can be 
distinguished by their hydrography and circulation 
patterns. The domains are separated by fronts that 
constrain cross-shelf exchange and are important 
locations for ecosystem interactions.  There are large 
seasonal differences in solar radiation, wind forcing, 
and sea ice.  The Bering Sea is connected to the North 
Pacific through the Aleutian archipelago and there is a 
shallow connection with the Arctic Ocean through the 
Bering Strait.  The region can be considered as a 
continuation of the North Pacific subarctic gyre. 
 
The region has high biological productivity that is 
strongly seasonal. Over 266 species in eight 
taxonomic classes of marine phytoplankton have been 
identified in the Bering Sea community.  Rates of 
primary productivity up to 225 gC m
–2
 y
–1
 have been 
reported from the most productive areas.  
Zooplankton biomass production is strongly seasonal 
but varies regionally, with estimates up to 64 gC m
–2
 
y
–1
 from the shelf edge to 4 gC m
–2
 y
–1
 for the coastal 
domain.  The region includes more than 450 species 
of fish and invertebrates, of which about 25 are 
commercially important. 
 
1. Fishery Management 
 
The groundfish fishery is managed by the North 
Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC; 
http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/npfmc/) under the Bering 
Sea/Aleutian Islands Groundfish Fishery 
Management Plan (http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/npfmc/ 
fmp/bsai/bsai.htm).  Management of commercially 
important crabs is delegated to the State of Alaska.  
Alaska is also responsible for managing harvests of 
salmon, herring, and scallops.    
 
Alaska groundfish fisheries 
 
Federally-managed Alaska groundfish fisheries occur 
in the U.S. EEZ, primarily on the shelf and slope areas 
of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and Bering Sea and 
Aleutian Islands (BSAI).  These fisheries are 
managed under two fishery management plans: the 
Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands Groundfish Fishery 
Management Plan  (http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/npfmc/ 
fmp/bsai/bsai.htm). 
 
Acceptable biological catch (ABC) and total 
allowable catch (TAC) levels are prescribed for a 
number of species in the BSAI, although some may 
not necessarily be a target species of the groundfish 
fisheries.  The environmental impact statement for the 
final specifications for the 2006–2007 fisheries on 
these species, which includes information on the 
biomass, ABC, overfishing levels, TAC levels, and 
the past year actual catch amounts can be found at 
http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/analyses/specs/06-07tacsp
ecseafrfa_v4.pdf. 
 
The following species/groups are actively managed in 
the BSAI region:  walleye pollock, Pacific cod, 
yellowfin sole, Greenland turbot, arrowtooth flounder, 
rock sole, flathead sole, Alaska plaice, ‘other flatfish’ 
(mostly starry flounder, rex sole and butter sole.), 
sablefish, Pacific ocean perch, northern rockfish, 
shortraker and rougheye rockfish, other rockfish (two 
predominant species: light dusky rockfish and 
shortspine thornyheads), Atka mackerel, squid, and an 
‘other species’ group (including sculpins, skates, 
sharks, and octopus). 
 
Another essential aspect of the management program 
is the large Observer Program.  Data provided by the 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2 
56  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
Observer Program is a critical element in the 
conservation and management of groundfish, other 
living marine resources, and their habitat.  For 
example, these data are used for:  1) assessing the 
status of groundfish stocks; 2) setting groundfish 
quotas and monitoring them in season; 3) monitoring 
the bycatch of non-groundfish species in season;  
4) assessing the effects of the groundfish fishery on 
other living marine resources and their habitat; and  
5) assessing methods for improving the conservation 
and management of groundfish, other living marine 
resources and their habitat.  The Observer Program 
also provides the industry with bycatch data it needs 
to make timely fishing decisions that decrease bycatch 
and increase productivity. 
 
Retained species 
The general approach to retained species management 
is the annual TAC-setting process and an at-sea 
Observer Program to monitor TAC.  Stocks or stock 
complexes within the retained (or target) species 
category are part of this process.  TACs are set by the 
NPFMC and are less than or equal to the ABCs set by 
stock assessment scientists which are, in turn, less 
than defined overfishing levels (OFLs).  The 
following document summarizes the tier system for 
setting groundfish ABCs and includes life history 
parameters for the managed stocks in the BSAI 
region:  http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/npfmc/summary_ 
reports/bsstock.htm.   Federal fishery scientists are, in 
general, responsible for deriving ABC and OFL 
estimates that are then reviewed by a panel of federal, 
state, and independent scientists who are on the 
Groundfish Plan Teams of the NPFMC.  These ABCs 
and OFLs are then presented to the Council’s Science 
and Statistical Committee for review.  The SSC then 
makes the ABC and OFL recommendations to the 
NPFMC.   Groundfish stock assessment documents 
each contain an ecosystem considerations section that 
outlines the ecosystem effects on the stock and the 
potential effects of that stock’s fishery on the 
ecosystem.  The ecosystem is also taken into account 
through the TAC setting process in which an 
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is prepared.   
  
Bycatch species 
There are several facets of bycatch management in 
Alaska groundfish fisheries, depending on the type of 
bycatch.  One is the accounting of bycatch of target 
groundfish species that are discarded, and these 
amounts are included in total catch estimates of the 
target species.  In 1998, an improved retention and 
utilization (IR/IU) amendment was approved that 
mandated the retention of pollock and cod in 
groundfish fisheries.  No special consideration is 
being given to species biodiversity among the bycatch 
species although biodiversity measures that include 
target and nontarget species are under development. 
 
For bycatch of non-target species, there is a special 
category called ‘prohibited species’ that is managed.  
In the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS), prohibited species 
include salmon, herring, crab, and halibut, and caps 
are placed on the amounts that can be caught by 
groundfish fisheries.  In addition, there are many 
gear/area restrictions that have been made to provide 
further protection to these prohibited species, which 
are the target for non-groundfish fisheries and are 
managed by either the State of Alaska (salmon, 
herring, and crab) or an international commission 
(halibut).  These agencies’ management practices 
promote sustainable stocks and, in some cases, catch 
mortality in groundfish fisheries is accounted for in 
stock assessments of these prohibited species.  A 
detailed history of the regulation of Alaska groundfish 
fisheries with regard to prohibited species can be 
found at http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/npfmc/sci_papers/ 
MFR.pdf.  There are many time/area closures, gear 
restrictions, and seasonal TAC apportionments 
designed to reduce bycatch of prohibited species.  One 
benefit of individual fishing quota (IFQ) fisheries 
(sablefish) is the reduced catch of prohibited species.  
There is a detailed reporting and accounting system 
that includes at-sea observers who provide estimates 
of total catch and discard mortality for prohibited 
species in the groundfish fisheries to ensure that 
catches are not exceeded.    
 
In some groundfish fisheries, particularly flatfish 
fisheries, the halibut cap is constraining and prevents 
the flatfish fisheries from achieving ABC.  
Groundfish fishery bycatch removals of these 
prohibited species do not significantly impact these 
stocks because groundfish fishery removals are much 
less than directed harvest amounts.  Halibut and 
herring are in good condition, some crab stocks are 
considered overfished (although directed fishing may 
not have been the proximal reason for some crab 
stocks falling below their minimum stock size 
thresholds (MSSTs).  Some western Alaska salmon 
stocks are depressed and the impact of bycatch 
removals are unknown for some stocks.  In general, 
the detailed accounting and bycatch cap approach to 
management of these species is very successful at 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 57 
providing protection to this group, although these 
constrain the groundfish fishery and thus may not be 
optimal from an economic point of view. 
 
Catch of a ‘forage species’ group is managed to 
prevent target fisheries from being initiated on those 
species, which include smelts, stichaeids, euphausiids, 
sandlance, sandfish, lanternfish, and gunnels.  These 
species are generally species with fast turnover rates 
but are not well studied in the region.  A maximum 
retention allowance (MRA) for each groundfish 
fishery is set at 2% of the total fishery catch for these 
species in aggregate.  Commerce in these species is 
currently prohibited, except for the small amounts 
retained under the MRA rates and for artisanal or 
subsistence uses.  Abundance estimates are not 
available for these species so their status is unknown.  
This group of fast turnover rate species is likely 
afforded sufficient protection by these maximum 
retainable bycatch limits that prevent target fisheries 
from starting on them. 
 
Although species contained in the ‘other species’ 
category are included in the target species 
management description, above, because they are 
managed using ABCs derived from the target species 
tier system, the species in this category are not 
currently economically important in North Pacific 
groundfish fisheries, but were perceived to be 
ecologically important and of potential economic 
importance, as well.  ‘Other species’ in the BSAI and 
GOA include sculpins, skates, sharks, squid and 
octopus (squid is catagorized as a separate group in 
the BSAI).  Stock assessments are conducted and 
TACs are established for other species and separately 
for squid in the BSAI.  Discussions are underway for 
improving the management of these groups through, 
for instance, improved detail in catch reporting.    
 
A group of invertebrate species called HAPC (habitat 
areas of particular concern) biota has been defined.  
This group consists of living structural habitat species 
such as corals, sea pens/whips, sponges, and 
anemones.  Some of these species, particularly deep 
water corals, are very long-lived and sensitive to 
fishing removals.  Large areas of the Aleutian Islands 
have now been designated as off limits for bottom 
trawling.    
 
Finally, there is a group of nonspecified species that 
are captured in the groundfish fisheries.  These 
include a huge diversity of fish and invertebrate 
species.  There is currently no management and only 
partial catch monitoring of species in this category, 
although retention of any nonspecified species is 
permitted.  The complete lack of reporting 
requirements may be problematic.  Research is 
ongoing to identify population trends in non- 
commercial species relative to fishing and climate.  
Species identification is very detailed for fish species 
in research surveys of the area but not very detailed 
for non-commercial invertebrates.     
 
2. Management of Threatened or Protected 
Species and Communities 
 
A number of threatened or endangered species or 
habitats for these species occur in Alaskan waters and 
these species are afforded protection under the ESA.  
The species include some marine mammals, seabirds, 
and fish.  The full list is available at http:// 
www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/esa_factsheet.pdf. Other 
marine mammal species are also afforded protection 
under the MMPA.  The general approach to fisheries 
management with respect to these species is the 
management of direct takes of species, utilization of 
take reduction devices, area closures to protect foraging 
habitat, and harvest rules that provide additional 
protection to key forage of some of these species.  
 
With the exception of salmon, the majority of these 
species are long lived K-selected species with a 
variety of foraging strategies.  There are difficulties in 
quantifying the level of natural variability in some of 
these stocks due to the past effects of direct harvest of 
mammals, and degradation of freshwater habitats of 
salmon, etc. that confound interpretation of species 
declines.  However, there have been observations of 
large variability in species abundance trends over the 
last 30 years that has been partly linked to climate 
variation, particularly for salmon.   
 
Fishery management restrictions that have been 
placed on Alaska groundfish fisheries because of ESA 
concerns are primarily for the protection of Steller sea 
lions and short-tailed albatross.  Measures are in place 
to protect Steller sea lions in nearshore and critical 
habitat areas through fishing closures in certain areas 
and temporal–spatial distribution of the catch.  
Overall abundance of key Steller sea lion prey 
(walleye pollock, Atka mackerel, and Pacific cod) is 
regulated through a lower threshold harvest when 
spawning biomass reaches 20% of the projected 
unfished biomass (B
20%
), which is more conservative 
than is used in single-species harvest strategies for 
those stocks.  The primary management concern for 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2 
58  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
short-tailed albatross is direct take in fisheries and 
very low take limits have been set (four takes within 
two years) that will trigger consultation.  In addition, 
seabird avoidance measures for fishing vessels have 
been mandated. 
 
Understanding and data are limited to providing 
general indications of status and change – often with 
many different plausible interpretations.  There is 
large uncertainty, particularly with regard to Steller 
sea lions, of the factors influencing the dynamics of 
this stock.  Large amounts of research funding and 
efforts of independent panels of scientists are being 
spent to evaluate the reasons for the decline.   
• Status of Steller sea lions and short-tailed albatross 
with respect to endangered listing reference point:  
these animals are still considered endangered.   
• Status of the fishery interactions with these species 
with regard to direct take limits:  interactions are 
below the direct take limits.   
• Status of the fishery interactions with regard to the 
indirect effects of fishery removal of prey:  
enactment of biological opinion protection 
measures should remove any adverse modification 
of habitat or jeopardy of species existence due to 
fishing but this is uncertain due to the difficulty in 
quantitatively evaluating these indirect effects. 
 
Direct take catch limits, gear modifications, and take 
reduction teams all provide good mechanisms for 
reducing direct takes of endangered and protected 
species.  Take limits, such as PBR rates, vary relative 
to the status of the stock of concern and relate to the 
stock’s productivity, and provide a sufficient trigger 
for management intervention  The qualitative nature 
of determining the degree of protected species 
protection provided, due to area closures and prey 
species harvest control rules when indirect 
interactions are the concern, are problematic and 
uncertain.  Considerable work needs to be done to 
determine more quantitative standards for reference 
points that ensure fisheries will not jeopardize the 
continued existence or adversely modify the critical 
habitat of listed species for these indirect interactions.  
However, detailed analysis of Steller sea lions and 
measures for their protection have been instituted 
through a Steller sea lion protection measures 
environmental impact statement (EIS) and a 
Biological Opinion.  An open public process has been 
employed, including the use of a unique stakeholder 
constituent committee, to develop fishery manage- 
ment alternatives.    
 
No consideration has been given to community 
biodiversity, except through protection of the 
individual pieces (individual community members).  
Development of biodiversity indices is ongoing 
though, typically, marine mammal and seabird 
communities are excluded from these because there is 
a lack of population abundance and trend information 
for many of the species. 
 
 
3. Habitat Management 
 
Habitat management for Alaska groundfish fisheries 
includes the consultation process mentioned above 
and the development of an Essential Fish Habitat 
Environmental Impact Statement (EFH EIS).  In 
addition, habitat protection is provided by a variety of 
area closures and bottom trawling restrictions that 
have been put in place over the years (see summary 
Bering Sea habitat conservation measures at  
http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/npfmc/current_issues/BSH
C/BSHC.htm).  Habitat assessment reports were 
developed for EFH of all managed species in Alaska 
(http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/habitat/).   
 
The BSAI and GOA groundfish management regions 
encompass a variety of habitat types.  The EBS shelf 
consists primarily of sand, mixed sand and mud, and 
mud substrates and an outer continental shelf.  The 
GOA has shallow, deep and slope areas that consists of 
soft (sand to gravel) or hard (pebble to rock) substrates.  
The Aleutian Islands region also consists of soft and 
hard substrates.  Efforts are ongoing to better map the 
distribution of living organisms that provide structural 
habitat to fish, but the AI and GOA are known to have 
deep-water corals that are long-lived.  Sponges also 
occur in all of these areas and are thought to be 
relatively long-lived, though present research is 
showing a range of recovery times.  Other epifauna that 
could be impacted by fishing gear include sea 
pens/whips and anemones, and not much is known 
about the recovery rates of these organisms.  Of the 
infauna in these regions, larger, longer-lived organisms 
include clams.  Smaller, higher turnover-rate 
organisms such as polychaetes also occur throughout 
the regions but little effort has been expended in 
mapping these distributions after U.S. surveys 
conducted in the late 1970s and early 1980s, although 
bottom typing efforts are ongoing.  Little is known of 
the natural levels of variability of these organisms 
although research is being conducted to compare 
densities and average sizes of organisms in trawled  
 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 59 
versus untrawled regions.  A habitat impacts model has 
recently been developed to provide a quantitative basis 
for relating fishing intensity and habitat recovery in the 
process of evaluating fishing effects.   
 
The main management response at this point is the 
requirement for federal agencies to consult with 
NOAA to see if that agency’s actions may adversely 
effect EFH, and for NOAA to provide conservation 
recommendations if deemed necessary.  For details on 
the consultation process, see http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ 
sfa/reg_svcs/Council%20stuff/council%20orientation
/2007/2007TrainingCD/TabT-EFH/EFH_factsheet. 
pdf.   
 
Reference points being developed for evaluating 
habitat effects relate to a standard for determining 
“adverse effects on EFH” that are “more than minimal 
and not temporary”.  Temporary impacts are defined 
as those that are limited in duration and that allow the 
particular environment to recover without measurable 
impact.  Minimal impacts are described as those that 
may result in relatively small changes in the affected 
environment and insignificant changes in ecological 
functions.  In the EFH context, the terms 
‘environment’ and ‘function’ refer to the features of 
the environment necessary for the life history 
requirements (spawning, breeding, feeding and 
growth to maturity) of the managed species and their 
function in providing that support.  Presently, for 
managed Alaska groundfish, the standard for 
assessment is the stock’s ability to remain above the 
minimum stock size threshold.   
 
Assessment of the status of groundfish species 
relative to this threshold is presently being done in the 
EFH EIS and the Programmatic Alaska Groundfish 
EIS.  It appears that groundfish stocks are above this 
threshold (for those in which MSST can be calculated, 
or else MSST is unknown).  Although MSST is a 
quantitative standard, it cannot be defined for some 
stocks due to lack of data.  Also, it provides only an 
indirect method of assessing the possible effects of 
habitat changes on a species’ productivity.  It seems 
there could be confounding factors, such as physical 
environmental regime shifts, that could make a 
species’ production appear to be unchanged, while 
habitat degradation could be ongoing and not noticed 
until a regime shift occurred.  Further research is 
required to quantitatively link habitat amount and 
condition with species production.  The Sitka 
Pinnacles Marine Reserve was designated, in part, 
because of the high diversity of organisms in that 
region, so some consideration to diversity is being 
given in management.  Also, the EFH EIS and 
Programmatic Groundfish EIS consider fishing 
effects on several types of diversity, including species 
diversity and structural habitat diversity.  Fishing 
effects on structural living habitat and benthic 
communities are considered qualitatively in these EIS 
documents that are being prepared.  
 
   
4. Community/Trophic Structure Management 
 
- General approach to management of food webs 
 
The MSFCMA allows the modification of a target 
species’ biological yield estimates to be modified to an 
OY that takes into account the protection of marine 
ecosystems and that is prescribed on the basis of the 
MSY from the fishery, as reduced by any relevant 
economic, social, or ecological factor.  Examples of 
ecological factors are given in the National Standard 
guidelines and include predator–prey or competitive 
interactions, and dependence of marine mammals and 
birds or endangered species on a stock of fish.  Thus, 
fishery managers are given direction in modifying 
maximum biological yield targets to account for 
ecological factors such as predator–prey relationships.  
In practice, an OY range is specified in the 
management of Alaskan groundfish.  In the EBS, the 
maximum OY is capped at 2 million metric tons (mt) 
and has proved constraining on individual target 
fisheries.  Guidelines indicate that OY should be a 
target reference point and not an absolute ceiling, but 
rather a desired result.  The EBS OY cap was not 
derived from a specific food web concern but rather as 
a general way of buffering total removals in the system.   
 
The Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation 
(SAFE) documents of the Alaskan groundfish 
fisheries includes an Ecosystem Considerations 
appendix that summarizes the best information 
available on the status and trends of various 
ecosystem components that are predators and prey of 
managed groundfish species, and includes the results 
of multispecies and ecosystem models of the region.  
Individual stock assessment reports now include a 
qualitative evaluation of the trends of predators and 
prey of the managed species.  Some species, such as 
walleye pollock, are cannibalistic and stock 
assessment of those species implicitly includes 
consideration of the cannibalism via the stock- 
recruitment curve.   
 
As mentioned in the “Bycatch species” subsection, 
the NPFMC has also designated a ‘forage fish’ 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2 
60  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
category that consists of relative fast turnover rate 
forage species such as gunnels, bathylagids, 
gonostomatids, lanternfish, sandfish, sandlance, 
smelts, stichaeids, and euphausiids.  A maximum 
retainable bycatch (MRB) rate  for each groundfish 
fishery is set at 2% of the total fishery catch for these 
species in aggregate.  Commerce in these species is 
currently prohibited except for the small amounts 
retained under the MRB rates and for artisanal or 
subsistence uses.  Abundance estimates are not 
available for these species so their status is unknown.   
 
Key forage species that are important prey of the 
endangered Steller sea lion and that are the target of 
commercial fishing in the region include walleye 
pollock, Pacific cod, and Atka mackerel.  Steller sea 
lion protection measures are in place to protect Steller 
sea lion foraging in nearshore and critical habitat areas 
through fishing closures in certain areas.  Overall 
abundance of key Steller sea lion prey (walleye pollock, 
Atka mackerel, and Pacific cod) is regulated through a 
lower threshold harvest when spawning biomass 
reaches 20% of the projected unfished biomass (B
20%
), 
which is more conservative than is used in single 
species harvest strategies for those stocks.   
 
The direct feeding interactions that involve target 
species primarily revolve around middle trophic level 
species such as walleye pollock and Atka mackerel, 
which are targets of fisheries and are prey of other 
target groundfish species in the BSAI and GOA.  
Cannibalism by walleye pollock in the EBS is well 
documented and explains part of the density 
dependence in the spawner–recruit relationship of 
pollock.  Single-species models of walleye pollock in 
the EBS and GOA have been developed which 
include predation by other species, including target 
groundfish. A multispecies virtual population analysis 
(MSVPA) model has also been developed for the EBS.  
It showed that most predation mortality on target 
species tends to occur in juveniles.  The trophic level 
of the groundfish catch has also been estimated for the 
EBS, AI, and GOA and appears to be relatively high 
and stable (see p. 224 of the Ecosystem 
Considerations appendix of the SAFE report:  http:// 
www.afsc.noaa.gov/refm/docs/2002/ecochap.pdf).   
 
Levels of natural variability in feeding interactions 
that involve target species are relatively high because 
of the variability in predator stock size and variability 
in the abundance of target species that serve as prey.  
MSVPA results from the EBS show that predation 
mortality of walleye pollock at age 1 can have 
relatively large interannual variability. 
Aside from the Steller sea lion prey protection rules 
mentioned above (B
20%
 lower threshold for walleye 
pollock, Pacific cod, and Atka mackerel spawning 
biomass and closed areas in sea lion foraging areas),  
the forage species maximum retainable bycatch rules 
and stock assessment scientist considerations of 
qualitative trends in predator or prey abundance for 
their stock (which could be used to justify changes in 
ABC recommendations but which, so far, has not 
been used in that way), there are no other planned 
management responses.     
 
The level of information available to parameterize 
models of groundfish predator–prey dynamics is 
relatively good – MSVPA, which has been developed 
for EBS and statistical catch at age models that 
include predators, has been developed for EBS and 
GOA pollock.  There are still lots of uncertainties 
about seasonal feeding dynamics, spatial–temporal 
variability in predation, and the form of the functional 
feeding responses of groundfish. 
 
Multispecies reference points have not been defined 
for this system, and for cannibalistic species such as 
walleye pollock and Pacific cod, such reference points 
may result in F
msy 
estimates that are higher than in the 
single-species case.  Walleye pollock, Pacific cod, 
and Atka mackerel are above the B
20%
 value 
established for Steller sea lions and MRBs of forage 
species have not been exceeded.  The 2 million mt OY 
cap on total groundfish catch in the EBS is frequently 
reached and constrains the groundfish catch.  For 
example, the sum of the recommended ABCs for 
BSAI groundfish in 2003 was 3.2 million mt, which is 
1.3 million mt above the OY cap. 
 
These reference points provide protection for 
endangered species that rely on target groundfish, 
prevent target fisheries from starting on some small 
pelagic fish stocks, and provide an overall cap on 
catch that is less than the sum of the individual ABCs.  
However, these do not provide explicitly for the needs 
of other predators in a particular year (i.e., through 
predator set-asides).  The OY cap constrains catch but 
does not explicitly constrain catch for a particular 
species, thus leading to ABC reductions based on 
economic considerations but not due to food web 
considerations.    
 
The EBS food web in general has been described in 
Aydin et al. (2002) (http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/ 
Publications/AFSC-TM/NOAA-TM-AFSC-130.pdf) 
based on parameterization of an Ecopath model of the 
system.  Similar models are being developed for the 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 61 
GOA and AI.  Ecosystem indicators are also under 
development, and the present state of indicators are 
reflected in the Ecosystem Considerations appendix 
of the SAFE report (http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/refm/ 
docs/2002/ecochap.pdf).  Most of these indicators 
reflect status and trends of environment, fishing 
pressure, and species abundance trends.  Aggregate 
indicators reflecting various ecosystem-level 
measurements, including types of diversity are also 
being developed.    
 
There is a fair amount of natural variability in the EBS, 
AI, and GOA food webs based on observations of 
species responses to climate variability.  Although 
primary and secondary production are not regularly   
evaluated in these systems, there have been unusual 
phytoplankton blooms occurring in recent years, 
along with dramatic changes in non-target species 
abundance including fish, bird, and marine mammals.   
 
There are no planned management responses to deal 
with the food web, except the inclusion of ecosystem 
information in the Ecosystem Considerations 
appendix of the SAFE report and the ongoing efforts 
to develop reference points that deal with the food 
web, in general.  General thresholds for evaluating 
fishing effects on ecosystem attributes have been 
developed as part of the requirements under NEPA to 
evaluate ecological effects of human activities (Table 
2.7.1).  Environmental impact statements which 
evaluate fishing effects on these ecosystems are being 
prepared.  Significance thresholds have been defined 
for food web effects of fishing on pelagic forage 
availability, spatial and temporal concentration of 
fishery on forage, removal of top predators and 
introduction of non-native species.  Ecosystem-level 
thresholds dealing with fishing effects on energy 
redirection and removals have been defined along 
with thresholds for species diversity, functional 
diversity, and genetic diversity.  Application of the 
thresholds require knowing either the natural levels of 
variability of a species or system attribute and the 
potential for fishing to bring that attribute either 
below a single species limit, such as MSST, or to 
bring a system attribute outside the range of natural 
variability.  Since these thresholds are difficult to 
define quantitatively in practice, indicators are used to 
evaluate whether or not particular organisms, groups, 
or ecosystem attributes are changing in an undesirable 
direction (Table 2.7.1). 
 
The level of information presently being used in this 
evaluation is mainly limited to providing general 
indications of status and change – often with many 
different plausible interpretations.  No target 
reference points at the general ecosystem level are 
being used, with the exception of keeping the sum of 
the individual species ABC limits within an OY range.  
This range was originally set equal to 85% of the 
range of the summed species-specific MSYs in the 
BSAI, in part to insure that future harvests would be 
sustainable.  Status of the food web relative to an 
ecosystem reference point is not known and heavy 
reliance is still placed on individual species status.   
 
The strengths/limits of general food web reference 
points are that the OY range provides some general 
food web protection although this should be evaluated 
using ecosystem models that have been developed for 
these regions.  It might be more appropriate to use OY 
constraints for trophic level groups (the forage fish 
MRBs could be thought of as an OY constraint for a 
trophic-level group though some central forage 
species, such as walleye pollock and Atka mackerel, 
might need to be included in an OY constraint that 
considers all mid-trophic level species).  Single- 
species thresholds appear to provide ecosystem 
protection – by protecting the individual pieces, you 
protect the whole.  However, there are many 
uncertainties about the effects of fishing on the food 
web as a whole, and the work developing ecosystem 
indicators and ecosystem models will be useful to 
evaluate the potential effects.  
 
 
5. Management of Contaminants and Pollution 
 
Fishery management in Alaska is primarily concerned 
with the effects of the physical environment on 
individual species production patterns because there 
is a great deal of evidence that climate influences are a 
strong driver of species recruitment in the region.  
Other agencies, such as the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) and Alaska, have primary 
responsibility for water quality issues, and fishery 
impacts on water quality through dumping of fish 
processing offal or vessel-related pollution is 
monitored and evaluated by these entities.  Individual 
permits are given to fish processing plants which are 
required to follow ‘total maximum daily load’ 
(TMDL)  plans for impaired waters to attain water 
quality standards for Alaskan waters.  TMDLs are 
specified individually to fish processing plants and 
depend partly on the characteristics of the receiving 
water basin with respect to water depth and exchange.

6. Management of Aquaculture and 
Enhancement Activities 
 
The EPA regulates all aquaculture activities in Alaska.  
Alaska aquaculture activities mainly consist of 
hatchery operations for rearing and release of salmon 
smolts.  Most salmon enhancement in Alaska is 
occurring outside of the GOA and is primarily 
focused on pink and chum salmon.  There are 30 
nonprofit hatcheries, two federal and two state 
hatcheries according to the latest Alaska Department 
Fish and Game (ADFG) salmon enhancement 
program report (http://www.sf.adfg.state.ak.us/ 
FedAidPDFs/fmr07-04.pdf).  Alaska’s hatcheries are 
primarily for sport fishing enhancement while the 
nonprofit hatcheries are for commercial enhancement 
goals.  ADFG geneticists, pathologists, and biologists 
review all projects before issuing a permit to operate a 
salmon ranching facility, transfer eggs or fish, or 
release any fish into Alaskan waters.  Production 
levels are relatively stable at this time.  EPA regulates 
hatchery operations by issuing permits to manage 
wastewater effluent (http://yosemite.epa.gov/R10/ 
WATER.NSF/webpage/Current+NPDES+Permits+in
+Alaska).    
 
In Alaska, saltwater aquaculture or sea culture of 
organisms by a variety of means to maturation only 
includes the farming of aquatic plants and shellfish. 
Farming of finfish is prohibited. In 2006, there were 
60 farms producing primarily oysters, with small 
numbers of clams and mussels being produced.  Most 
of this is occurring outside of the EBS.  Broodstock 
must be from state certified sources or else an 
application must be made to acquire broodstock from 
other sources.  Regulation of the farming of these 
products is primarily to ensure food safety and quality 
and to ensure disease-free stock.  A growing area 
classification must be completed before shellfish may 
be harvested for sale.  Classification is a two-part 
process, the water quality survey and shoreline survey. 
The water quality survey consists of the collection of 
water samples that are taken from designated stations.  
The shoreline sanitary survey is a physical on-site 
evaluation of all actual and potential sources of 
pollution that may affect the growing area. 
   
2.7.4 Case Study 2:  U.S. Pacific Coast 
Groundfish 
 
Ocean Management Activities 
 
The federally-managed groundfish community off 
California, Oregon and Washington occurs on the 
shelf and slope areas in the U.S. EEZ.  This area is 
located entirely within the California Current Large 
Marine Ecosystem.  The fishery is managed by the 
Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC; 
http://www.pcouncil.org) under the Groundfish 
Fishery Management Plan (FMP; http:// 
www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/), with catch levels 
proposed in the Groundfish EIS (http://www. 
pcouncil.org/groundfish/current-season-management/).  
In-season adjustments are often recommended by the 
PFMC and must then be approved by NOAA.  Every 
two years, the PFMC and NOAA convene to update 
and adjust policies that are currently in place. 
 
 
1. Fishery Management 
 
The Pacific Coast groundfish fishery has limited entry, 
open access, recreational, and tribal components.  
Most take is allocated to the limited entry permit 
fishery, comprised of separately regulated trawl and 
fixed-gear fleets; most landings come from trawlers.  
The open access fishery cannot use trawl gear directed 
at groundfish harvest.  Landings have recently been 
managed by cumulative trip limits and seasonal or 
annual quotas, although a transition to a catch-share 
system, known as ‘rationalization,’ is now underway 
(details available at http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/Groundfish 
-Halibut/Groundfish-Fishery-Management/). The text 
below generally reflects management practices prior 
to rationalization. 
 
The general approach to retained species management 
is the annual TAC-setting process and an Observer 
Program to monitor TAC.  Stocks or stock complexes 
within the retained (target) species category are part 
of this process.  TACs are set by the PFMC and are 
less than or equal to the ABCs set by stock assessment 
scientists, which are, in turn, less than defined OFLs.  
Alternative ABCs, OYs and TACs for the fishery are 
prescribed in Chapter 2 of the Groundfish EIS 
(http://www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/current-season
-management/).  The alternatives are offered because 
there are multiple goals of fishery management that 
 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2 
64  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
may be at odds with one another; chief among these 
potentially conflicting goals is the desire to maximize 
the economic value of the fishery and the need to 
rebuild depleted stocks that co-occur with healthy 
target species.  Federal fishery scientists are, in 
general, responsible for deriving ABC and OFL 
estimates that are reviewed by the Groundfish 
Management Team, a panel of federal, state, and tribal 
scientists.  These ABCs and OFLs are presented to the 
Council’s Science and Statistical Committee for 
review.  The SSC then makes the ABC and OFL 
recommendations to the PFMC.  The observer 
program (http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/research/ 
divisions/fram/Observer/) provides targeted catch, 
bycatch, and discard data in addition to the logbook 
data maintained by fishing vessels, and also monitors 
changes in fishing behavior as vessels approach their 
limits for target species.  Observer coverage in the 
Pacific Coast groundfish fleet is designed so that all 
limited entry trawling vessels are observed for a 
minimum of two consecutive months every two years.  
The exception is the at-sea hake fishery (vessels that 
catch hake and deliver them to at-sea processing 
vessels), which receives 100% observer coverage.  
Some additional observer effort focuses on fixed gear 
fisheries. 
 
Routine (i.e., on-going but regularly updated) 
restrictions on limited-entry fisheries are in place for 
several species, based on PFMC recommendations 
and on the classification of certain groundfish stocks 
as overfished.  Principal among those restrictions is 
setting seasonal quotas and/or cumulative trip limits 
that may be geographically based.  Routine 
restrictions are in place for all groundfish caught by 
open access or recreational fisheries.  The PFMC can 
recommend, and NOAA can implement, management 
actions beyond the scope of the routine actions in 
order to address arising conservation or socio- 
economic concerns.  Some notable examples are 
described below. 
 
Time/space closures to some, or all, fishing gears can 
be enacted when certain species reach defined quotas 
in a season or year, or they may be established on a 
permanent basis.  Recently there have been several 
large-scale closures throughout the EEZ.  In June 
2005, the PFMC voted to permanently close all EEZ 
waters deeper than 1280 m to bottom trawling, and 
closed seamounts to all bottom-contacting gears.  
Several times in recent years, the PFMC has 
temporarily closed bottom and midwater trawling on 
the continental shelf in regions referred to as Rockfish 
Conservation Areas (RCAs).  These areas are large, 
complexly shaped polygons defined by many 
waypoints in order to cover the appropriate depth 
strata, which define preferred habitat for overfished 
rockfish species such as bocaccio, canary rockfish, 
darkblotched rockfish, and Pacific ocean perch.  Other 
year-round closed areas that have been in place since 
the late 20
th
 Century are the Cowcod Conservation 
Areas (CCAs) located off the coast of southern 
California, and the Yelloweye Rockfish Conservation 
Area (YRCA) located off the coast of Washington.  
The PFMC is currently exploring the use of electronic 
vessel monitoring systems (VMSs) to track the 
movement of fishing vessels through closed areas.  
Finally, there are dozens of much smaller marine 
reserves throughout the region, typically in coastal 
regions, with varying degrees of restrictions on 
fishing and other human activities. 
 
A second management tool is restricted size of 
footropes on shelf trawls.  Rollers on footropes may 
be no greater than 8 inches (20.3 cm) in diameter, 
which essentially prevents fishing in rocky habitats 
because of the high likelihood of gear damage 
(Hannah, 2003).  Management believes that rocky 
habitats are critical for several life stages of 
groundfish, particularly rockfish, and that protecting 
these habitats by making them effectively untrawlable 
will improve rockfish rebuilding efforts. 
 
Another notable management tool was the recent 
buyback of trawl permits and vessels in the limited 
entry fishery.  This federal legislation, implemented in 
2003, was intended to reduce fishing effort on 
groundfish by roughly one third, and to increase 
financial stability among the fishing community.  It 
ultimately funded the buyout of 92 vessels and 92 
groundfish permits.  This effort may be further 
augmented by a combined trawl permit buyback and 
marine protected area establishment proposed by The 
Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense 
Fund, non-governmental organizations that plan to 
purchase the permits for roughly half of the remaining 
trawlers in Central California and then establish 
marine reserves in the same areas to conserve 
sensitive benthic habitats, fish species, and related 
marine resources (see details in Appendix F of the 
Groundfish Essential Fish Habitat Environmental 
Impact Statement, available at http://www.nwr.noaa. 
gov/Groundfish-Halibut/Groundfish-Fishery-Manage
ment/). 
   
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 65 
- General approach to management for target and 
bycatch species 
 
Eighty-nine fish species are actively and specifically 
managed under the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP:  
62 species of rockfish (59 species of the genus 
Sebastes; shortspine and longspine thornyheads; 
California scorpionfish); 12 species of flatfish 
(arrowtooth and starry flounder; Pacific sanddab; 
butter, curlfin, Dover, English, flathead, petrale, rex, 
rock and sand sole); six roundfish (lingcod, cabezon, 
kelp greenling, Pacific cod, Pacific whiting (hake) and 
sablefish); one morid (finescale codling); one 
grenadier (Pacific rattail); and seven chondrichthyans 
(leopard and soupfin sharks; spiny dogfish; big, 
California and longnose skates; ratfish).  However, 
the FMP states that any ‘rockfish’ (i.e., a member of 
the family Scorpaenidae) is subject to management 
under the FMP.  Pacific and California halibut are not 
managed under this FMP.   
 
The dominant retained species are hake, rockfish, 
sablefish, and flatfish.  Hake are potentially highly 
productive, with relatively short generation times (8 
years) and high fecundity, but their production is 
constrained by stochastic recruitment success such 
that hake biomass is typically dominated by a few 
strong year classes.  In general, rockfish (particularly 
large-bodied species) are slow to mature and have 
slow growth rates.  Rockfish generation times are 
often measured in decades.  They are live-bearing fish 
with very high fecundities, but survival of larvae is 
very poor and, in some species, episodic.  Adult 
natural mortality rates are assumed to be low.  These 
life history characteristics render rockfish susceptible 
to overfishing even at moderate rates of fishing 
mortality (Parker et al., 2000).  Sablefish have longer 
generation times than hake and episodic year class 
strength that appears strongly related to climate 
conditions.  Flatfish vary broadly in terms of life span 
and size-specific fecundity.   
 
Juvenile and adult hake eat mostly euphausiids, with 
larger adults also eating amphipods, squid, herring, 
smelt, crabs, and other fish, including juvenile hake.  
Juvenile hake are also eaten by lingcod and some 
rockfish while adults are eaten by sablefish, sharks, 
and marine mammals.  Rockfish occupy a broad range 
of trophic roles owing to their species diversity, size 
diversity, and habitat diversity.  Their diets range 
from gelatinous zooplankton to fish, with euphausiids 
being almost universally important.  Larval, juvenile, 
and smaller adult rockfish provide food for other 
groundfish, albacore, marine mammals, sharks, and 
birds.  Sablefish diets include fishes, cephalopods and 
benthic invertebrates.  Young sablefish provide food 
for seabirds, fishes (including lingcod), and marine 
mammals.  Juvenile and adult flatfish eat benthic 
invertebrates and fish, and are preyed upon by sharks, 
marine mammals, sablefish, and other flatfish.  Some 
flatfish, such as English sole, inhabit estuaries at early 
ages, and are vulnerable to wading birds. 
 
Population status of Pacific Coast groundfish is 
monitored through regular field surveys, using both 
fishery-independent trawl surveys and hydroacoustics.  
These surveys provide data on spatial distributions, 
habitat-specific abundances, and age structure of 
groundfish populations in trawlable habitats.  NOAA 
scientists are attempting to improve monitoring of 
groundfish stocks in untrawlable habitats, but that is a 
relatively new research effort.  Additionally, acoustic 
surveys concurrent with midwater trawl sets are done 
to monitor hake which inhabit midwater regions.  
Data from these surveys and from the fishery are 
incorporated into formal stock assessments; a 
compilation of SAFE documents for Pacific Coast 
groundfish from 2001 to the present is available at 
http://www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/. However, given 
the time required to conduct a stock assessment, the 
number of species in the FMP and the constant need to 
update assessments of key species, the number of 
species actually assessed is far less than the total 
number of species managed.  For example, during the 
2007–2008 biennium 23 species were assessed. 
  
For the purposes of management, a species in this 
FMP is designated at ‘precautionary status’ if its 
spawning stock biomass (SSB) falls below 40% of the 
estimated unfished biomass.  More drastically, a 
species is considered ‘overfished’ if its SSB is below 
25% of the estimated unfished biomass.  When fish 
are declared overfished, formal rebuilding plans are 
initiated; if SSB reaches 10% of initial, a zero catch 
policy is enacted.  Rebuilding plans are currently in 
place for several overfished rockfish species; owing to 
the long generation times and low productivity of 
rockfish, target biomasses for some rockfish are not 
expected to be achieved for many decades. 
 
Because several rockfish species have been declared 
overfished, and because their life history renders them 
especially sensitive to fishing mortality, fishing 
mortality target levels are being re-evaluated for 
rockfish.  In the early 1990s, stock assessments of 
rockfish suggested that a fishing mortality (F) of F
35%
 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2 
66  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
would be sustainable; this was soon changed to F
40%
 
(Clark, 2002).  This indicates a fishing mortality that 
would reduce the spawning biomass per recruit (a 
proxy for lifetime egg production) to 40% of that in an 
unfished population.  On subsequent analysis, this 
strategy was found to be unsustainable because of the 
low resiliency of rockfish to exploitation (Clark, 
2002).  More conservative F levels are being 
considered and implemented in current OY 
determinations for rockfish.  For example, recent draft 
stock assessments of vermilion rockfish (MacCall, 
2005a), widow rockfish (He et al., 2005), and 
bocaccio (MacCall, 2005b) are all using F
50%
 in their 
yield determinations. 
 
Other species listed in FMP are considered either at 
target level, above target level, or have insufficient 
information to assess their populations.  In cases 
where the abundance of species is based on either 
limited modeling (‘data moderate’ species) or solely 
on landed catch (‘data poor’ species), the PFMC may 
consider lowering the prescribed OY by 25% or 50%, 
respectively.  A data-moderate OY reduction is under 
consideration for two flatfish (sanddabs and rex sole) 
that have not been assessed recently. 
 
The bycatch mitigation plan (see http:// 
www.nwr.noaa.gov/Groundfish-Halibut/Groundfish-
Fishery-Management/) goes into considerable detail 
about the species listed in both this section and the 
following “Threatened or Protected Species” section.  
It describes several alternative strategies for reducing 
the total bycatch and subsequent bycatch mortality in 
the groundfish fishery through changes in effort or 
catch limits.  These alternatives have broad overlap 
with management strategies intended to optimize 
yield in the overall fishery while concurrently 
rebuilding stocks of depleted species, as drawn out in 
the Groundfish Environmental Impact Statement 
(http://www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/current-season-
management/).  
 
Many categories of bycatch species are recognized 
within the FMP, including overfished groundfish, 
highly migratory species (HMS), coastal pelagic 
species (CPS), prohibited species, and protected 
species.  Incidentally caught overfished groundfish 
are often referred to as bycatch because they are rarely 
targeted, particularly those that have SSBs below the 
critical threshold of 10% of unfished biomass.  
Nonetheless, they are unavoidably caught in fisheries 
targeting more abundant groundfish.  Although this 
bycatch is recognized as unavoidable, the PFMC and 
NOAA attempt to restrict it by setting low quotas for 
overfished species and monitoring those catches in 
season through the Observer Program.  Meeting or 
exceeding those quotas may result in activation of a 
time/space closure such as an RCA. 
 
HMS (tunas, billfishes, pelagic sharks) are mostly 
pelagic and are rarely caught in groundfish gears, and 
thus are not likely to be affected by groundfish 
management, unless perhaps by effort re-allocation 
related to groundfish permit buybacks or decreases in 
groundfishing opportunities.   
 
CPS (e.g., squid, sardine, anchovy, mackerel) are 
often caught in the hake fishery, which is a midwater 
trawl fishery, and in much lower numbers in 
groundfish gears associated with the bottom.  Bycatch 
in the hake fishery can be large. For example, >80 mt 
of squid were caught in the 2001 at-sea hake fishery.  
The Pacifc Coast Groundfish FMP and EIS require 
that these species’ status be considered in terms of 
impact.  For that reason, take of these species is 
monitored, although any bycatch-related management 
decisions have to be made in conjunction with the 
CPS FMP, under which these species are managed.  
Current assessments indicate that biomasses of 
sardine and mackerel are increasing relative to other 
coastal pelagics, with both species being harvested at 
near-record levels.  In contrast, squid population 
dynamics are highly variable and recruitment-driven.  
Sardine and anchovy population dynamics are 
strongly driven by interactions with climate regimes 
(Chavez et al., 2003) as well as by fishing. 
 
There is a special category of non-target bycatch 
species called ‘prohibited species’, meaning that they 
must be returned to the sea as quickly and safely as 
possible if brought on board.  In the Pacific Coast 
Groundfish FMP, prohibited species include all 
Pacific salmon, Pacific halibut, and Dungeness crab 
(although Dungeness crab take is permitted in 
California waters, if done in accordance with 
California law).  In addition, joint-venture operations 
(in which foreign processors receive fish caught in the 
U.S. EEZ) are prohibited from receiving salmon, 
Pacific halibut, Dungeness crab, and species outside 
of specific authorization or in excess of limits or 
quotas.  Pacific salmon bycatch mostly occurs in the 
hake fishery, and specific fleet-wide bycatch rates 
have been established for Chinook salmon, which is 
the species most likely to overlap spatially and 
temporally with hake (the allowable rate has rarely 
been exceeded).  These fish must be immediately 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 67 
returned; if retained, they are turned over to the state 
at which they are landed.  Pacific halibut may only be 
kept if they are tagged, provided that the tag is 
returned to the International Pacific Halibut 
Commission (IPHC), the body that manages Pacific 
halibut.  Bycatch of Pacific halibut that results in 
halibut mortality probably does not affect the overall 
status of the halibut population because halibut caught 
in Washington, Oregon, or California waters are 
likely at the southerly extent of the population and do 
not represent large numbers of the spawning stock 
biomass.  However, fishing mortality of Pacific 
halibut incidentally caught by groundfish gear does 
count toward the total quotas established by the IPHC.  
Although this bycatch has been substantial on 
occasions, it is likely to have been curtailed in recent 
years by the establishment of RCAs which overlap 
with much of the Pacific halibut habitat off 
Washington, Oregon, and California.  Dungeness crab 
are often taken in groundfishing gears, and all must be 
returned to the sea in Washington and Oregon.  
Despite this regulation, some mortality occurs, 
especially when the crabs are in the vulnerable 
soft-shell state following molting.  Some RCA 
boundaries have been extended into shallower waters 
in molting seasons to minimize this impact.  In 
California, some take of Dungeness crab is allowable 
in accordance with state regulations, which include 
size limits and a strict prohibition on the retention of 
female crabs. 
 
Recently, the deep-sea coral communities of the 
continental slopes have attracted special attention 
with respect to groundfish fisheries.  In slope regions, 
large footrope gear is permissible, and there is 
growing concern that these and other trawl gears will 
impact deep-sea coral communities, which are poorly 
studied.  The impact of groundfish fishing on deep-sea 
coral communities remains unknown. 
 
More generally, bottom trawling likely has a strong 
impact on substrates and associated organisms,  
especially benthos such as sponges, anemones, sea 
cucumbers, sea stars, sea pens, sea whips, and sea 
urchins, and benthopelagic organisms such as octopus.  
Little is known about the intensity or impact of trawl 
contact with benthic communities, although some 
generalizations can be hypothesized.  For example, 
one might expect trawl impacts to be greater in 
relatively stable habitats that are not affected by 
strong current or wave action compared to more 
disturbance-prone habitats associated with higher 
wave energy.  Also, there are some fishing grounds 
off California, Oregon, and Washington that are 
known to be regions of relatively high trawling 
intensity (NRC, 2002).  However, the overall 
quantitative impacts of bottom trawls on these 
habitats remain unknown.  As part of the evolution of 
the Essential Fish Habitat Environmental Impact 
Statement (EFH EIS) process, however, these issues 
will be addressed.  Additionally, in the standard 
fishery-independent trawl surveys of groundfish 
abundance conducted annually by NOAA, biologists 
are now recording data on benthic invertebrates 
although these data are essentially limited to 
presence/absence of species. 
 
Many other species are captured in groundfish 
fisheries, including some fish and invertebrate species 
with commercial value that are managed at state 
levels (e.g., California halibut, shrimp, crab, sea 
cucumber), and others with recreational value (e.g., 
California sheepshead, greenlings, ocean whitefish) 
or low human value (e.g., eelpouts, midshipman, cat 
sharks).  There is currently no management but some 
catch monitoring of species in this category, and 
retention of any nonspecified species is permitted.  
The impacts of different management alternatives on 
species such as shrimp, finfish, and other species not 
directly covered by the Groundfish FMP are discussed 
in the bycatch mitigation plan (available at 
http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/Groundfish-Halibut/Groun
dfish-Fishery-Management/).  Devising effective 
management measures to reduce bycatch will require 
additional economical and socio-cultural information.  
 
 
2. Management of Threatened or Protected 
Species and Communities 
 
In addition to the prohibited species noted in the 
previous section, there are several threatened and 
protected species in the EEZ off the Pacific Coast.  
These species fall under three overlapping categories 
(ESA-listed species, marine mammals, and seabirds), 
reflecting four mandates (the ESA, the MMPA, the 
MBTA, and Executive Order 13186, which gives 
further protection to migratory birds).  Further 
protection for some of these species is outlined in the 
MSFCMA.    
 
A number of threatened or endangered species or 
habitats for these groups occur in Pacific Coast EEZ 
waters, and these species are afforded protection 
under the ESA.  Those species (and their ESA listing 
status) include:  Pacific salmon (numerous threatened 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2 
68  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
and endangered stocks in California, Oregon, 
Washington, and Idaho), sea turtles (endangered:  
leatherback; threatened:  green, loggerhead, olive 
Ridley), seabirds (endangered:  California least tern, 
California brown pelican, short-tail albatross; 
threatened:  marbled murrelet), and marine mammals 
(endangered:  blue whale, fin whale, humpback whale, 
North Pacific right whale, sperm whale; threatened:  
Steller sea lion, Guadalupe fur seal, sea otters in 
California).  The listing status of some species, such 
as the southern resident killer whale (listed as 
‘depleted’ under the MMPA), is the subject of some 
controversy.  One mollusk, the white abalone, is 
endangered in this region, although it dwells in rocky, 
untrawlable habitat and is thus not likely to be directly 
affected by groundfish harvesting.   
 
Take of Pacific salmon was discussed above in the 
section on bycatch; as prohibited species, Pacific 
salmon must be returned to the sea as quickly as 
practicable, regardless of their status under the ESA. 
 
Interactions between sea turtles and groundfish gear 
or vessels are rare; most fishery-related sea turtle 
mortality appears to occur in gillnets (which are not 
used in groundfish harvest) or longlines (which are 
rarely used by the groundfish fleet in depths inhabited 
by sea turtles). 
 
The Pacific Coast groundfish fishery is considered a 
low-risk fishery in the context of the MMPA.  Direct 
incidental take of marine mammals by Pacific Coast 
groundfishing vessels has occurred in the hake fishery, 
but the take has been minimal.  For example, between 
1997 and 2001, by far the most frequently taken 
marine mammal was the Dall’s porpoise, but the 
average annual take by the entire hake fleet was 2.56 
porpoises/year.  Observer coverage from the 
remainder of the fishery indicates little direct take. For 
example, observer coverage of 30% of the limited 
entry fixed gear and 10% of the limited entry trawl 
fishery in fall 2001 to fall 2002 found a total take of 11 
marine mammals, mostly California sea lions.  The 
overall fishery is regarded as Category III under the 
MMPA, indicating a remote likelihood of mortality or 
injury related to fishing activity.  The more likely 
impact of groundfish fishing is in changes to marine 
mammals’ food supply, whether by removal of their 
prey, alteration of the food webs in which they exist, 
or through provision of food via discard.  These 
impacts, however, are not well known. 
 
As with marine mammals, direct impacts of 
groundfishing on birds appear to be minimal, whereas 
indirect effects (e.g., food web effects) are poorly 
studied.  Observer data suggest that direct mortality of 
seabirds is very low. For example, observer coverage 
of 30% of the limited entry fixed gear and 10% of the 
limited entry trawl fishery in fall 2001 to fall 2002 
found a total take of 5 birds.  Most direct interaction 
appears to be birds scavenging offal on decks or 
discarded overboard, but there are little spatial or 
temporal data to quantify such interactions with birds 
and vessels. 
 
Besides the ESA-listed seabirds mentioned previously, 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated several 
birds as ‘species of special conservation concern.’  
These include black-footed albatross, ashy storm 
petrel, gullbilled tern, elegant tern, arctic tern, black 
skimmer, and Xantus’s murrelet.  Furthermore, 
migratory seabirds receive protection from the MBTA, 
an international treaty among Canada, Japan, Mexico, 
Russia, and the U.S. which forbids the killing, taking, 
or possessing of a migratory bird.  EO 13186 
mandates agencies to work with the Fish and Wildlife 
Service (FWS) to establish Terms of Understanding 
about the impact of human activities upon migratory 
birds; NOAA and the FWS are currently developing 
such Terms for migratory birds.  Finally, the 
MSFCMA requires compliance among NOAA- 
enforced fisheries management actions and all 
legislation designed to protect seabirds.   
 
 
3. Habitat Management 
 
Essential fish habitat (EFH) for Pacific Coast 
groundfish is defined generally as the aquatic habitat 
necessary for groundfish production that supports 
both long-term sustainable fisheries and healthy 
ecosystems.  To satisfy this description, EFH must be 
described for all life history stages of managed 
species.  Pacific Coast groundfish species managed by 
the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP occur throughout 
the EEZ and occupy diverse habitat types at all stages 
in their life histories.  EFH for any one species may be 
large (e.g., a species with pelagic eggs and larvae that 
are widely dispersed) or comparatively small (e.g., 
nearshore rockfish which show strong affinities for a 
particular location or type of substrate). 
 
EFH descriptions and management were originally 
incorporated into the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP 
in Amendment 11 (available at http://www. 
pcouncil.org/groundfish/, but EFH designation and 
management were updated in 2006 with the adoption 
of Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP Amendment 19 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 69 
(available at http://www.pcouncil.org/ groundfish/).  
This Amendment was a result of the process of 
developing a Groundfish Essential Fish Habitat 
Environmental Impact Statement (EFH EIS), which 
was finalized in late 2005 (http://www.nwr. 
noaa.gov/Groundfish-Halibut/Groundfish-Fishery- 
Management/).  Although EFH designation does not, 
by itself, confer protection upon a habitat, it does 
bring that habitat into the context of the EFH habitat 
management plan, which is intended to maintain or 
enhance habitats and their associated ecological 
and/or socio-economic benefits.  The EFH EIS 
presents a framework for:  1) identifying groundfish 
EFH (waters and substrate necessary to fish for 
spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity) 
and habitat areas of particular concern (HAPC; EFH 
that is especially important, sensitive, rare, or 
threatened by potential human activity); quantifying 
the ‘habitat suitability probability’ of potential 
groundfish habitat; 3) identifying strategies to 
minimize fishery-related impacts on EFH and HAPC; 
4) conducting research and monitoring to evaluate the 
effectiveness of groundfish habitat management; and 
5) identifying the ecological and socio-economic 
benefits and costs of implementation alternatives.  
The EFH EIS also describes the legislative basis for 
cooperative EFH management between the federal 
government, state governments, and tribal groups. 
 
Habitat management for Pacific Coast groundfish 
fisheries has been done primarily through the standard 
federal consultation process.  Specific cases in which 
action has been taken to minimize fishing impacts on 
EFH are limited to a few cases, although those cases 
are considerably important.  A chief example is 
limiting bottom trawling to soft sediments; the 
mandatory small rollers on trawl footropes mean that 
vessels are unlikely to trawl around rocky bottoms 
due to potential gear damage.  This means that rocky 
reef habitat, considered critical habitat for groundfish, 
is ‘untrawlable’, and is mostly fished by sport anglers 
or commercial longliners.  Also, closing large areas to 
fishing is intended not just to lower fishing mortality, 
but also to protect habitat where fish species of 
concern (e.g., yelloweye rockfish, cowcod) are found.   
 
The standard consultation processes involved in 
identifying EFH, the modeling involved in the EFH 
EIS, and a general assessment of groundfish fishing 
impacts on marine habitats are data-intensive 
endeavors.  Many programs exist for identifying and 
quantifying different habitat types in the Pacific Coast 
EEZ.  At the federal level, these efforts include 
bottom mapping and related groundtruthing, using 
multibeam sonar equipment, echo sounders, and 
remote operated vehicles (ROVs) with cameras.  
Overlapping surveys are done to assess the physical 
and chemical characteristics of the water overlying 
different habitat types.  More recently, NOAA 
biologists have begun efforts to assess the populations 
of groundfish in untrawlable habitats through use of 
ROVs and towed camera sleds, hook-and-line surveys, 
and mark-recapture studies.  Such information will 
increase the accuracy of coastwide stock assessments. 
 
Regarding empirical monitoring and research of 
human impacts on benthic habitats inhabited by 
groundfish, there are many human activities that have 
direct and indirect effects; these include fishing, 
dumping, dredging, oil and gas production, oil spills, 
water intake, cabling, pollution via runoff or 
wastewater discharge, coastal development, kelp 
harvesting, and introduction of non-indigenous 
species. 
 
Fishing with bottom-contact gears, as described in the 
previous section, has numerous impacts on habitat 
(NRC, 2002), although they have not been well 
documented in this fishery (see Appendix C of the 
Groundfish EFH EIS, available at http://www.nwr. 
noaa.gov/Groundfish-Halibut/Groundfish-Fishery- 
Management/).  Bottom-contact gears can remove or 
damage benthic habitat-forming species, ranging 
from macrophytes to corals to invertebrates, as well as 
infaunal species that influence sediment stability by 
burrowing and water quality by filter feeding.  It can 
also disrupt soft sediments through creating trawl 
scars that last anywhere from hours to years, 
depending on circulation patterns, sediment type, 
trawling speed, and trawl door size and weight; such 
areas can experience local areas of high sediment 
suspension and resettlement, nutrient release, and 
hypoxia (Kaiser et al., 2002).  Through repeated 
trawling of the same area, soft sediments can also 
become compacted.  Other potential direct impacts on 
habitats include loss of gear, such as pots, traps, 
longlines or gillnets on hard substrates, which could 
result in ‘ghost fishing’ by those gears and local, 
habitat-specific increases in fish mortality until the 
gears biodegrade or are salvaged.  Fishing vessel 
discards of unwanted bycatch or offal that sink to the 
bottom and decompose may result in localized 
hypoxia. 
 
Direct and indirect impacts of the non-fishing human 
activities are described in Appendix C of the 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2 
70  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
Groundfish EFH EIS, available at http://www.nwr. 
noaa.gov/Groundfish-Halibut/Groundfish-Fishery- 
Management/.  Most of these descriptions are general, 
not specific to the U.S. Pacific Coast.  These activities 
are regulated by established legislation (e.g., the 
federal Clean Water Act, http://www.epa.gov/ 
agriculture/lcwa.html) and by local, state and federal 
permitting processes, which often involve a full 
environmental impact statement.  Specific impacts of 
these activities on groundfish habitats (and, by 
extension, groundfish ecology) have not been well 
documented, although it is likely that many of the 
activities occur in relatively nearshore habitats and 
thus have a low impact on continental shelf or slope 
species. 
 
 
4. Community/Trophic Structure Management 
 
- General approach to management of food webs 
 
At present, there is little empirical or modeling 
information on the extent to which food web 
interactions affect the population biology of Pacific 
Coast groundfish species, and hence the stock 
assessment models for these species remain 
essentially single-species models.  In 2001, a panel of 
NOAA scientists compiled a Stock Assessment 
Improvement Plan (SAIP; http://www.st.nmfs.gov/ 
st2/saip.html) to address ways to augment stock 
assessments through, among other things, 
incorporating food web interactions into population 
dynamics.  A specific need cited in that document for 
Pacific Coast groundfish was to account for the role of 
increased pinniped abundance which could signal an 
increase in predation mortality on groundfish.  Still 
other cases involving predation by groundfish on 
other groundfish have gained attention in the recent 
literature (e.g., Mangel and Levin, 2005), and the 
PFMC has acknowledged the importance of food web 
interactions by banning the harvest of euphausiids 
(http://www.pcouncil.org/coastal-pelagic-species). 
This ban was enacted not because krill are overfished 
(in fact, they are not harvested at all), but precisely 
because they are a ‘fundamental food source’ for 
many marine species.  The same document notes the 
possibility of extending this ban to other forage 
species.  Thus, it is clear that food web interactions are 
considered important in managing this system. 
 
Diets of many key Pacific Coast groundfish species 
have been studied quantitatively, including Pacific 
hake (Gotshall, 1969; Outram and Haegele, 1972; 
Livingston, 1983; Tanasichuk et al., 1991; Buckley 
and Livingston, 1997; Grover et al., 2002), sablefish 
(Laidig et al., 1997), some shelf rockfish (Reilly et al., 
1992; Lee, 2002) and nearshore rockfish (Hallacher 
and Roberts, 1985; Hobson and Chess, 1988; Murie, 
1995), arrowtooth flounder (Gotshall, 1969), and 
spiny dogfish (Tanasichuk et al., 1991).  Many of 
those studies evaluated diets over limited spatial and 
temporal scales.  Diets of multispecies groundfish 
assemblages are summarized in some sources (e.g., 
Quast, 1968; Lea et al., 1999; Love et al., 2002).  
Buckley et al. (1999) present quantitative, coastwide 
diet data from several size classes, seasons, and years 
for hake, sablefish, three flatfish, two thornyheads, 
and two grenadiers.  Also, some prey (squid, 
euphausiids, and certain myctophids) are relatively 
ubiquitous and can thus be described as key to 
groundfish production.  There is, however, a general 
scarcity of quantitative diet data that span large 
geographic ranges, multiple ontogenetic stages, 
seasons, or changes across climate regimes of 
different temporal scales. 
 
Diets of several rockfish species off the Oregon coast 
have been inferred through analysis of stable isotope 
ratios (Bosley et al., 2004).  Tracer methods like 
stable isotope analysis are an attractive research 
avenue because they capture diet habits over a longer 
time scale than stomach analysis; they are not subject 
to some sources of bias in stomach analysis (e.g., 
empty stomachs, stomach eversion, feeding while in 
the capture gear); and they provide information about 
the ultimate sources of production that support a 
species. 
 
Our growing knowledge of diets will bring a better 
notion of bottom-up and top-down forces that 
structure groundfish populations and communities.  
The effects of bottom-up forces, such as the quality 
and quantity of prey on rockfish growth and 
reproductive fitness, have been shown both 
empirically (Lenarz et al., 1995; VenTresca et al., 
1995) and with bioenergetics modeling (Harvey, 
2005).  Cases where poor spring and summer feeding 
conditions constrain female rockfish from storing 
enough lipids to produce a normal amount of larvae 
(Guillemot et al., 1985; Lenarz et al., 1995; 
VenTresca et al., 1995) clearly link food web 
 processes to rockfish population biology.  Top-down 
forces, apart from fishing mortality, have been difficult 
to identify in groundfish communities, but some 
models argue for their importance and demonstrate 
their potential importance if overlooked.  Mangel and 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 71 
Levin (2005) developed alternative models of marine 
reserves intended to enhance a population of bocaccio 
rockfish.  The efficacy of some marine reserves hinged 
on whether or not lingcod, which prey on young 
bocaccio, were included in the model.  This was 
because lingcod, which have faster growth rates and 
shorter generation times, responded more rapidly to the 
cessation of fishing and quickly reached sizes and 
numbers capable of suppressing juvenile bocaccio 
through predation. 
 
Bottom-up and top-down forces occur in concert, with 
varying degrees of impact, against a backdrop of 
environmental variability and fishery exploitation.  
Because of this complexity, scientists are using 
community-level or ecosystem-level modeling tools 
to simulate ecological dynamics.  Field (2004) 
developed a model of the Northern California Current 
ecosystem using the Ecopath with Ecosim software 
(Christensen and Walters, 2004).  The Ecopath 
mass-balance model was used to estimate, for 
example, linkage strengths in the food web, the effects 
of hake predation on different forage bases, the 
relative impacts of fishing and predation on 
groundfish stocks, and how the importance of 
thornyheads in sablefish diets has been overestimated 
(Field, 2004).  The dynamic Ecosim model was used 
to estimate food web responses to fisheries and 
climate anomalies (upwelling, PDO).  Among the 
inferences Field (2004) made concerning groundfish 
were:  that hake compete for prey with Pacific 
salmon; that hake are a key source of mortality for 
pink shrimp; and that populations of longspine 
thornyheads, which are expected to decline due to 
fishing, may actually remain stable because their 
major predators, sablefish and shortspine thornyheads, 
have also been fished down. 
 
Food web modeling may also help to demonstrate 
relationships between groundfish and other members 
of the community.  Larval and juvenile groundfish are 
known to be important prey for seabirds (Sydeman et 
al., 2001; Miller and Sydeman, 2004).  Also, although 
the groundfish fishery has little impact on seabirds 
and marine mammals in terms of bycatch mortality 
(PFMC, 2004a), it likely influences their population 
in other ways:  fisheries may deplete stocks of 
groundfish that apex predators depend on, whereas 
scavenging birds and mammals certainly feed on 
bycatch or offal that vessels discard. 
 
Finally, it is noteworthy that there are relatively few 
specifics concerning food web dynamics in the FMP 
(PFMC, 2004a) or the fishery EIS (PFMC, 2004b).  
This does not indicate a lack of concern on the part of 
the PFMC – rather, it illustrates the difficulty in 
acquiring food web information and integrating it into 
an already complex system of population assessment 
and management.  This underscores the strong 
potential of food web models:  once user-friendly 
ecosystem-level food web models are available to 
decision-makers, the models can be used to synthesize 
available information and generate hypotheses or 
serve as guidelines toward determining the strength of 
food web interactions that ultimately may shape 
groundfish population dynamics.  This, in turn, will 
lead to empirical studies designed to provide 
quantitative information for use in stock assessments. 
 
 
5. Management of Physical Environment 
 
The groundfish community occurs against a backdrop 
of physical conditions characterized by bottom 
topography and sediment type, bathymetric gradients, 
dynamic current structures at many spatial scales, 
chemical gradients, water temperatures, and climate.  
All of these factors can influence fish distribution.   
 
The bottom habitat of the Pacific Coast EEZ is 
characterized by a fairly narrow continental shelf 
(rarely wider than 50 km) and a broader slope; most 
trawling for groundfish occurs on the shelf at depths 
up to about 500 m.  Bottom types are typically sand, 
mud, gravel, boulders, rocky pinnacles, or exposed 
bedrock.  Major geological  features include capes and 
points (notably Point Conception and Cape 
Mendocino) and submarine features (notably 
Monterey Canyon, the Mendocino Escarpment, and 
Astoria Canyon) that often mark approximate 
boundaries for shifts in groundfish species 
composition.  Species composition of groundfish 
communities is also linked to more basic physical 
gradients such as latitude and depth.  For example, 
Williams and Ralston (2002) classified several 
distinct assemblages of rockfish based on latitude and 
depth, and Love et al. (2002) have found that rockfish 
species diversity increases from north to south along 
the North American coast.  Estuaries provide habitat 
for juvenile life stages of some groundfish, including 
English sole and lingcod. 
 
In terms of oceanography, the dominant feature of this 
region is the California Current, a large clockwise 
surface current that branches off the North Pacific 
Current in the region of Vancouver Island.  It brings 
Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management  Section 2 
72  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
relatively cool water southward along the coast until 
roughly Point Conception, where it moves away from 
the coast.  The California Current is strongest and 
closest to shore during the summer.  The deeper, 
slower California Undercurrent runs northward along 
the Pacific Coast.  Dynamics within the California 
Current, along with major wind events, can lead to the 
coastal upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water which 
leads to increased primary production that can be 
propagated throughout the food web.  Upwelling is 
often associated with areas that have submarine 
canyons.  While upwelling is typically associated with 
episodes of high primary productivity, a recent large 
upwelling event introduced hypoxic water to waters 
off the northern U.S. Pacific Coast, causing large 
amounts of groundfish mortality and stress on other 
demersal and benthic communities (Grantham et al., 
2004).  Many eddies and jets occur along the coast, 
often created or influenced by coastal geologic 
features such as capes and points.  These localized 
current dynamics may be especially important to 
groundfish species whose larvae undergo a prolonged 
pelagic larval stage because current-driven dispersal 
and/or retention of larvae can have strong influence 
on recruitment.  South of Point Conception is the 
Southern California Bight, dominated by a 
counterclockwise eddy of relatively warm water. 
 
Much research in recent years has focused on the 
importance of climate variability on growth, survival, 
recruitment, and spatial distribution of groundfish.  
Variability ranges from changes in wind, temperature, 
and upwelling intensity on the scale of 1 to 2 years (El 
Niño Southern Oscillations (ENSOs) and La Niñas) to 
decadal-scale climate regime shifts (the Pacific 
Decadal Oscillation (PDO)).  ENSOs have probably 
received the most attention, and their effects vary 
among different groundfish.  For example, the warm 
waters and poor upwelling associated with an ENSO 
often create poor conditions for rockfish recruitment 
and have led to poor growth, reduced fecundity, and 
increased mortality among adult rockfish.  Changes in 
temperature caused by ENSO events may also result 
in dramatic shifts in species composition of the 
groundfish prey community (Brodeur and Pearcy, 
1992).  In contrast, hake recruitment has been strong 
in years after ENSOs (Hollowed et al., 2001).  A shift 
from one PDO regime to another leads to differences 
in air pressure, oceanic circulation, and other key 
oceanic properties that affect primary production and 
consumer species composition (Francis et al., 1998).  
Among rockfish off Southern California, the ‘cool’ 
PDO regime appears to be more favorable, as 
measured by larval abundance (Moser et al., 2000).  
Pacific Coast groundfish may also be influenced by 
other sources of long-term variation:  strong year 
classes for some groundfish have been associated with 
decadal-scale variation related to Aleutian Low 
pressure events in conjunction with ENSO events, 
rather than the timing of PDO regimes (Hollowed and 
Wooster, 1992, 1995).  Sablefish year class strength 
off some regions of the Pacific Coast appears related 
more to factors such as seasonal Ekman transport and 
sea level than to adult abundance in a traditional 
stock-recruit relationship (Schirripa and Colbert, 
2006). 
 
Overall, despite the research dedicated to 
relationships between climate and groundfish, there 
has been little done to incorporate this research into 
management.  Integrating climate variability into 
stock assessments, and understanding the 
relationships between climate and recruitment, are 
high priorities for Pacific Coast groundfish 
management.   
 
6. Management of Contaminants and Pollution 
 
There are many potential sources of contaminants and 
pollutants that can impact the ecosystems supporting 
Pacific Coast groundfish, and pollutants can take the 
form of toxic substances, discarded or lost materials 
such as plastics, or thermal discharges.  Notable 
sources are point sources (rivers, sewage outfalls, 
power plants), non-point source runoff, atmospheric 
deposition of globally dispersed chemicals, oil spills, 
dumping, military activities, and shipping (via engine 
exhaust, materials lost overboard or dumped, or 
shipwrecks).  Some human activities may also 
encourage production of natural toxins, such as those 
occurring in certain algal blooms.  While other factors 
such as species introductions and sonar equipment 
have been described in similar terms (‘biological 
pollution’ and ‘noise pollution’, respectively), those 
factors will not be addressed in this section as they are 
probably more relevant to other ecosystems (e.g., 
estuaries and intertidal habitats for species 
introductions) or communities (e.g., marine mammals 
for sonar activity). 
 
In the Pacific Coast region, there has been widespread 
addition of terrestrial nutrients from point sources and 
non-point runoff, and a wide range of local, state, and 
federal laws are in place that set standards for levels of 
point and non-point pollution (e.g., http://www. 
ecy.wa.gov/water.html).  Considerable research has 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 73 
been done on the effects of eutrophication on 
nearshore habitats, especially estuaries, bays, and 
seagrass beds.  Little information is available on how 
eutrophication directly affects groundfish production, 
however.  Similarly, it is well known that increased 
nutrient levels can lead to harmful algal blooms 
(HABs) on the U.S. Pacific Coast, including red tides, 
brown tides, and blooms of the diatom 
Pseudo-nitzschia that produce domoic acid, a toxin 
readily incorporated into marine food webs.  However, 
there is little research directly connecting HABs with 
the ecology of groundfish. 
 
In contrast, many anthropogenic contaminants and 
toxins have been found in tissues of groundfish on the 
U.S. Pacific Coast.  These chemicals likely arrived in 
groundfish systems via point sources (rivers, outfalls, 
oil spills, urban centers, anti-fouling treatments) and 
non-point sources (terrestrial runoff, atmospheric 
deposition).  They can then be taken up by direct 
absorption across gill membranes or indirectly via 
bioaccumulation through the food web, producing 
lethal and sublethal affects.  Contaminants buried in 
marine sediments can also be resuspended by 
dredging activities.  A large body of recent literature 
is devoted to levels of chlorinated hydrocarbons and 
heavy metals in groundfish tissues, not only around 
urban centers such as south Puget Sound (e.g., Stein et 
al., 1992; Johnson et al., 1998; O’Neill and West, 
2004) but also around relatively undeveloped areas 
such as the Farallone Islands (Sydeman and Jarman, 
1998).  Most of the impacts evaluated in these studies 
are sublethal, such as effects of exposure levels on 
enzyme levels or reproductive output.  While 
guidelines for human consumption of groundfish have 
been set in many areas (e.g., http://www.doh.wa.gov/ 
ehp/oehas/fish/default.htm), and overall domestic 
release of organochlorines and heavy metals has been 
greatly reduced by legislation such as the Clean Water 
Act (http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/lcwa.html) and 
Clean Air Act (http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/), there 
have not been sweeping ecosystem management 
actions in specific response to contaminant levels in 
Pacific Coast groundfish.  Recommendations on how 
to minimize contaminant impacts on groundfish were 
made in Amendment 11 of the FMP.  
 
Oil and petroleum spills are a major problem on the 
U.S. Pacific Coast, owing to extensive oil production 
on the continental shelf in California waters, and the 
large amount of oil that is shipped through areas 
subject to strong storms and characterized by rocky 
coasts or shoals.  While coastwide programs are in 
place to coordinate response to spills (e.g., 
www.oilspilltaskforce.org/index.htm), they remain 
essentially inevitable:  whereas the global trend has 
been one of fewer major spills in recent decades, the 
number of yearly oil or petroleum spills >37,850 L in 
the California Current region has been relatively 
unchanged from 1978–1999 (Mearns et al., 2001).  
Over 150 spills of this magnitude occurred on the U.S. 
Pacific Coast in this period (the vast majority in 
California), and many more small spills also occurred; 
the dispersal characteristics of these spills vary 
considerably (Mearns et al., 2001).  Oil and petroleum 
spills can have lethal or sublethal effects on 
groundfish (Marty et al., 2002) and the species that 
they depend on for prey or habitat.  Species that feed 
on groundfish (sea birds, marine mammals) are also 
adversely affected, as are fisheries that typically close 
while clean-up activities are occurring.  Oil spill 
dispersant chemicals are, themselves, potentially 
toxic to some fish and to other species that provide 
biogenic habitat or prey, although often less so than 
the oil that they are used to disperse (Singer et al., 
1995).  Regarding management responses and 
recovery rules concerning oil and petroleum spills, it 
seems likely that species groups other than groundfish 
will dictate the course and pace of decision making, 
particularly because many of the species most 
obviously affected by oil spills are also federally 
protected species, such as marine mammals and 
seabirds, or are targets of surface-oriented fisheries, 
such as salmon and herring. 
 
Debris, garbage, and dredge spoil have been dumped 
regularly at sea in the U.S. Pacific Coast region, as 
evidenced by a survey that found debris on 14% of the 
seafloor between 10 and 200 m off Southern 
California (Moore and Allen, 2000).  The debris in 
that study was patchy and occurred at low density.  It 
was comprised mostly of fishing gear, plastics, metal, 
glass, and miscellaneous items.  Debris on the sea 
floor may be the result of intentional actions (e.g., 
dumping, littering, military exercises) or accident 
(e.g., loss of fishing gear, shipwrecks, loss of cargo in 
inclement weather, discharge of debris in stormwater).  
Dredge spoil dumping may also introduce some 
debris in addition to large loads of sediment.   
 
Overall, the impacts of non-fishing activities, 
including pollution and contaminant production, on 
groundfish in this region are very poorly studied, and 
thus there are no reliable measures of target levels for 
management responses, nor have risk assessments and 
mitigation plans been developed.

7. Management of Aquaculture 
 
Currently, there is little or no aquaculture for 
groundfish species in the U.S. Pacific Coast EEZ.  
However, pen rearing of groundfish to market size is 
certainly feasible, and captive breeding of some 
groundfish species, notably lingcod, sablefish, and 
brown rockfish, is being studied in the U.S. at the 
Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC, NOAA, 
Seattle; http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/research/divisions 
/reutd/marineenhance.cfm and www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/ 
publications/issuepapers/pdfs/reut6203.pdf). Exten- 
sive aquaculture of at least one rockfish species, 
Sebastes schlegeli, occurs in Asia, underscoring the 
feasibility of groundfish culture. 
 
Wild groundfish may be affected by regional 
aquaculture activities that produce non-groundfish 
species.  For example, oyster and other bivalve culture 
in coastal regions may affect groundfish by providing 
habitat, affecting prey abundance, or by altering water 
quality.  Whether such effects would be positive or 
negative has not been established experimentally 
owing to the difficulty of conducting controlled field 
studies in such areas.  Salmon net pen aquaculture has 
been linked to many localized environmental 
problems, including eutrophication, hypoxia, and 
disease introduction; Kent et al. (1998) found that 
groundfish near a salmon net pen were infected with 
viral and bacterial infections previously only seen in 
pen-reared salmon.  Further studies assessing links 
between groundfish ecology and non-groundfish 
aquaculture practices would be valuable. 
 
Aquaculture has changed the global fish market 
because fresh, domesticated finfish and shellfish are 
now available in large quantities at all times of the 
year.  These resources are cheaper to produce than 
wild finfish and shellfish, which has driven seafood 
prices down.  To remain competitive, groundfish 
managers, harvesters and processors have attempted 
to allocate harvest more evenly over the course of a 
calendar year (e.g., Chapter 7 of the 2009–2010 
Groundfish EIS, avaliable at  http://www.pcouncil.org/ 
groundfish/current-season-management/).  How this 
temporal allocation of fishing mortality will affect 
groundfish ecology is unclear, as is the impact of 
changing price structures caused by global 
aquaculture. 
 
8. Management of Enhancement Activities 
 
As referred to in the “Management of Aquaculture” 
section,  researchers at the NWFSC have undertaken 
captive breeding studies for lingcod, sablefish, and 
many rockfish species.  This research covers topics 
such as physiology, nutrition, pathology, 
developmental biology, and optimal conditions for 
rearing larvae, with a long-term goal of large-scale 
culturing (see http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/research/ 
divisions/reutd/marineenhance.cfm and http://www. 
nwfsc.noaa.gov/publications/issuepapers/pdfs/reut62
03.pdf).   
 
As of this writing, there have been no artificially 
reared larval or juvenile groundfish releases (akin to 
the release of hatchery-reared Pacific salmon smolts) 
into Pacific Coast waters of the U.S.  As captive 
breeding methods at the NWFSC are developed and 
refined, subsequent research (as listed in the issue 
paper cited above) will shift to: 
• establishing captive broodstocks of marine species 
to provide offspring for research;  
• determining appropriate conditions for using 
hormonal and environmental manipulation to 
stimulate and synchronize spawning;  
• developing egg incubation, larval culture, and 
juvenile rearing technologies;  
• developing environmentally-sound aquaculture 
techniques, feed and health-management practices 
for rearing juveniles to maturity and spawning;  
• developing rearing technologies that are both 
cost-effective and environmentally friendly; and 
• investigating the genetic and ecological effects of 
released fish on wild populations. 
 
Longer-term groundfish enhancement efforts noted in 
the issue paper include:   
• establishing and maintaining captive broodstocks 
for future research;  
• raising sablefish and rockfish broodstocks under 
photoperiods that have been shifted to provide 
offspring out of season (doubling the amount of 
research that can be done on critical larval stages); 
• training state biologists, tribal members and 
entrepreneurs in large-scale rearing technologies;  
• conducting stock-enhancement aquaculture trials 
in cooperation with state and tribal fisheries 
agencies. 
Section 2 Developing an Ecosystem-based Approach for Ocean Management 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 75 
Despite the groundfish stock enhancement research 
focus described above, there are no plans for artificial 
groundfish propagation listed in the current FMP or 
the groundfishing EIS. 
 
Another means of groundfish enhancement is creating 
or restoring habitat that promotes groundfish 
production.  Groundfish, such as rockfish, clearly 
aggregate around artificial substrates such as oil and 
gas platforms off the California coast, and there is 
considerable support from multiple public sectors to 
preserve decommissioned platforms as artificial reefs 
although more research is needed as to the suitability 
of oil platforms as productive groundfish habitat 
(Helvey, 2002).  Restoration of large kelp species, 
which form dense stands that provide habitat for 
nearshore groundfish and valuable recruitment 
substrate and nursery habitat for juveniles of many 
inshore and offshore species, has been undertaken in 
many areas.  For example, in Southern California 
waters, the California Coastkeeper Alliance and 
NOAA have a project in which laboratory-reared kelp 
sporophytes are transplanted to reefs in the wild (see 
details at http://www.cacoastkeeper.org/). The 
transplants are monitored regularly, and potential 
grazers, such as sea urchins, are relocated to preserve 
kelp growth.  Other researchers have used plastic kelp 
blades which act as a mechanical defense for living 
kelp against sea urchins in Southern California waters 
(Vasquez and McPeak, 1998). 
 
As with any project designed to increase groundfish 
abundance, responses to habitat enhancement will be 
difficult to monitor because of the long generation 
times and unpredictable recruitment success of many 
groundfish species.  The inherent difficulty in 
observing and enumerating these species in 
non-trawlable habitats adds further complication.

2.8 Progress Toward Ecosystem Approaches to Management – Fisheries 
 
To various degrees, the country profiles discussed 
above have responded to the explicit request to 
identify the extent to which fisheries management in 
each country is developing an EAM.  This responds to 
part of the charge to WG 19.  In addition, there has 
been attention to broader questions of how an EAM 
can be implemented across sectors.  As a means of 
documenting the ability of countries to implement 
EAM, WG 19 devised a template (Appendix 2) to 
allow reporting of progress towards EAM.  In the 
experience so far from Canada and the U.S., we are in 
the early stages of implementing an EAM for 
fisheries. 
 
WG 19 explored various ways to identify how a 
country may take on a full-scale EAM (Table 2.8.1).  
In the Working Group approach, this would require 
that additional sectoral approaches to EAM be 
considered and that eventually an integrated approach 
to ocean management across all sectors be made.  
 
WG 19 members from each country reviewed the list 
of EBM components in the Fisheries Management 
Sector matrix  (Table 2.8.1); only Canada and the U.S.  
reported on progress in their respective country in 
using each of those components under each 
management category.  The scoring system used is 
given below, followed by an example of a  completed 
matrix for Canada and the U.S. (Table 2.8.2):

At present there is considerable discussion about 
which approach to management should be used and 
what would be the differences between approaches.  
Table 2.8.3 builds off the fisheries oriented 
conceptual matrix (Table 2.8.1) and the examples of 
how it could be used to guage progress toward an 
ecosystem approach to fisheries management (Table 
2.8.2).  In Table 2.8.3 we explore how an ecosystem 
approach could be implemented across multiple 
sectors in integrated multisector ecosystem-based 
management.  An integrated multisector approach 
clearly requires taking into account different uses and 
evaluating trade-offs among uses, including higher 
priorities for protecting habitat, biodiversity and 
aesthetic values. 
 
Similar approaches could be developed for other key 
sectors of economic and management significance, 
e.g., aquaculture, wildlife, shipping, and energy in the 
North Pacific in the coming years, as appropriate.

2.9 Relevant National Marine Ecosystem Monitoring Approaches  
 
An initial term of reference for WG 19 was to describe 
relevant national marine ecosystem monitoring 
approaches and plans and types of models for 
predicting human and environmental influences on 
ecosystems.  Key information gaps and research and 
implementation challenges were to be identified.  
Working Group members informally reported on 
national monitoring efforts at the first two working 
group meetings.  However, after reviewing the nature 
of the work already completed as part of the 
PICES/Census of Marine Life/IPRC Workshop on 
“Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and 
Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in 
the North Pacific” (Alexander et al., 2001) on 
summarizing national monitoring and modeling 
efforts, this term of reference was deemed to be a 
duplication of that effort.  WG 19 focused instead on 
linking monitoring efforts to our third term of 
reference on indicators.  In the section on Ecosystem 
Indicators that follows, member countries focused on 
reporting on the availability of monitoring 
information that could be used to report on ecosystem 
status through key indicators identified by the 
Working Group.  The following is a summary 
provided by WG 19 of the key considerations of 
monitoring with respect to implementing ecosystem 
approaches to management which requires 
developing a monitoring and reporting system that 
provides information on ecosystem status, threats, and 
success of management efforts relative to stated 
management objectives.   
• A common set of indicators is proposed for PICES 
member countries to monitor ecosystem status 
with respect to fisheries impacts. 
• Monitoring systems in place at the present time are 
sufficient for calculating many of these indicators 
of ecosystem status and change. 
• Enhancements to the monitoring system are 
needed in all member countries to measure habitat, 
size-based indicators, benthic invertebrates, and 
total fishery removals. 
• Predicting future ecosystem conditions will 
require advancement of a variety of models that 
incorporate human and climate factors. 
• Further work is needed to define a broader set of 
human impact indicators outside of the fisheries 
context, including socio-economic. 
• Understanding and communicating the main 
drivers of change in each region will be important.

3.1 Introduction 
 
Development and discussion of marine ecosystem 
indicators is currently a very active research topic 
worldwide.  This is connected with the increased 
interest in moving forward with ecosystem-based 
management (EBM) of marine resources, and 
recognition of the need to index and summarise the 
state of marine ecosystems.  
 
There are many types of indicators, including those of 
the physical environment (e.g., climate), ecological, and 
socio-economic conditions.  There is an entire 
professional journal devoted to the topic, called 
Ecological Indicators.  Within marine systems, the 
most recent focus has been on developing indicators for 
ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). 
Significant recent literature on this topic includes the 
symposium on “Quantitative ecosystem indicators for 
fisheries management” hosted in Paris in 2004 by the 
SCOR Working Group 119, of which a selection of 
papers were published in the ICES Journal of Marine 
Science (Vol. 62(3), May 2005; see the Introduction by 
Cury and Christensen (2005) and the afterward by Daan 
(2005)).  Additional important reviews are by Degnbol 
and Jarre (2004), Fulton et al. (2004), Jennings (2005), 
and Link (2005). Important contributions focussed on 
the North Pacific are those by PICES (Jamieson and 
Zhang, 2005; Kruse et al., 2006).  
 
This section does not attempt an exhaustive and 
critical review of the ‘state’ of marine ecosystem 
indicators.  Rather it provides a summary of the 
emerging consensus views on indicators of marine 
ecosystems, and makes recommendations applicable 
to North Pacific waters of PICES interest.  In addition, 
this section attempts to take a broader view of 
indicators for EBM of marine systems rather than the 
narrower application to fisheries management (even 
though most of the research to date has focussed on 
this narrower application).  
3.1.1 Classes of Indicators 
 
The desire to develop indicators for EBM is rooted in 
the need to reduce the complexity of natural systems 
to an ideally small set of synthetic indices of 
ecosystem state, and to measure the progress of 
management towards the policy objectives for that 
ecosystem. In human health, an analogy for indices of 
ecosystem state might be body temperature and heart 
(pulse) rate which allow a rapid assessment of the 
immediate condition but without any indication of 
cause. 
 
The PICES report on ecosystem indicators for the 
North Pacific (Kruse et al., 2006, pp. 95–96) 
recognised a distinction between ‘contextual’ and 
‘management’ indicators.  Contextual, or ‘audit’, 
indicators provide information on the background 
conditions, which may include conditions over which 
humans have no control.  Indicators of atmospheric 
and oceanographic climate such as temperature, 
salinity, sea ice, plus synthetic indicators such as the 
Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
indices, are examples of contextual indicators.  These 
have also been called ‘descriptive’ indicators by 
Degnbol and Jarre (2004).  Management, or ‘control’, 
indicators summarise information on conditions over 
which humans have (some) direct control, and 
conceptually should be applicable to measure the 
results of management actions.  Degnbol and Jarre 
(2004) call these ‘performance’ indicators which 
compare actual conditions with some desired set of 
conditions, such as a management goal.  Degnbol and 
Jarre (2004) identify two additional classes of 
indicators which address mostly socio-economic 
conditions.  These are ‘efficiency’ indicators, which 
relate environmental pressures to human activities, 
and which these authors suggest are highly relevant 
for policy-making.  They provide an example of the 
volume of fuel per ton of fish caught as an indicator of 
energy efficiency.  Vessel subsidies per revenue from 
Ecosystem Indicators  Section 3 
84  PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
fishing may be another example.  The other class of 
indicators are ‘total welfare’ indicators which provide 
some measure of overall sustainability (which 
includes human social systems).  
 
All these classes of indicators, with the exception of 
the contextual or descriptive indicators, are most 
useful (perhaps most meaningful) when applied in the 
context of specific objectives – i.e., they indicate what 
the current conditions of the system are in relation to 
some desired state or condition.  In this sense, 
indicators are best developed and applied within the 
broad concept of EBM, which should start with 
explicit statements of the objectives for management 
(e.g., O’Boyle and Jamieson, 2006).  
 
A framework that has gained broad acceptance in 
other fora, and which is beginning to be explored for 
marine systems, is the Driver-Pressure-State- 
Impact-Response (DPSIR) concept originally 
developed by the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD; e.g., Smeet 
and Weterings, 1999; Rapport and Singh, 2006).  In 
this framework Driving forces, such as climate 
change or human population growth, exert Pressures 
on the environment (e.g., fishing effort) which change 
the State of the environment with possible Impacts to 
the functioning of the system.  Societies may then 
provide a Response to these changes by modifying the 
Pressures (Degnbol and Jarre, 2004).  Each of the 
levels in this DPSIR framework, with the possible 
exception of the Response (which is a policy action), 
use indicators to summarise their condition.  Jennings 
(2005, p. 212) noted that “In a management 
framework supported by pressure, state, and response 
indicators, the relationship between the value of an 
indicator and a target or limit reference point… 
provides guidance on the management action to take”. 
There needs to be a close relationship between 
indicators and clear policy objectives. 
 
 
3.1.2 Characteristics of Good Indicators 
 
Degnbol and Jarre (2004) and Rice and Rochet (2005) 
provide criteria for desirable indicators. Although 
directed towards EBFM, these criteria are sufficiently 
general to apply to ecosystem-based marine 
management more broadly.  General principles are 
that the indicator should be sensitive (to the process 
being indexed), observable, acceptable, and related to 
the management objectives (Table 3.1.1).  The best 
indicators would be those which are easily measured, 
cost effective, and easily understood (interpreted). In 
addition, Rice and Rochet (2005) provide a step-wise 
process for selecting the suite of ecosystem indicators: 
Step 1 determine user needs, 
Step 2 develop a list of candidate indicators, 
Step 3 determine screening criteria, 
Step 4 score candidate indicators against the 
screening criteria, 
Step 5 summarise the scoring results, 
Step 6 decide how many indicators are needed, 
Step 7 make the final selection, 
Step 8 report on the chosen suite of indicators. 
 
However, as noted by Rochet and Rice (2005), the 
process of selection is not without difficulties.  
Experts may provide very different scores and these 
differences must be confronted through discussion in 
order to reach compromise on a final suite of 
indicators.  One possibility is that test sets (data 
collected under known conditions) or simulations 
(e.g., Fulton et al., 2005) are used to challenge the 
indicators and verify their performance under a range 
of conditions. This can clarify the usefulness of 
candidate indicators. 
 
 
3.1.3 Potential Indicators 
 
In regard to the feasibility of developing indicators to 
assist with the management of marine resources, the 
2004 Paris symposium allowed several conclusions to 
be drawn (Cury and Christensen, 2005): 
• defining and implementing indicators is 
achievable with present knowledge, data, and 
frameworks; 
• no single indicator describes all aspects of 
ecosystem dynamics; a suite of indicators is 
needed (covering different data, groups, and 
processes); 
• environmental and low trophic-level indicators 
capture environmental change and bottom-up 
effects,  
o global effects of environmental change (e.g., 
regime shifts) on higher trophic levels are not 
well captured by most indicators (at least 
individually, suites can elucidate these 
impacts); 
• high trophic-level indicators (e.g., birds, marine 
mammals) summarise changes in fish 
communities, 
o top-down effects can be quantified using 
trophodynamic indicators; 
Section 3 Ecosystem Indicators 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 85 
• size-based indicators are promising for 
characterizing fish community dynamics in a 
context of over-exploitation; 
• ecosystem-based indicators are conservative,  
o they only show if the ecosystem is strongly 
affected, so trends and rapid changes must be 
evaluated by research and/or management; 
• interpretation of indicators requires scientific 
expertise because of potential error and bias in 
their analysis; 
• some indicators are better used for surveillance 
than for prediction. Regime shifts illustrate a 
situation where surveillance indicators may be 
useful;  
• in an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, 
the objective is not to find the best indicator but 
rather a relevant suite of indicators with known 
properties; 
• a strong feedback between scientific expertise and 
management is necessary to improve indicators 
and their practical use. 
 
In terms of applications to fisheries management, a 
consensus is emerging on a core set of ecosystem 
indicators (e.g., Degnbol and Jarre, 2004; Fulton et al., 
2004; Fulton et al., 2005; Shin et al., 2010).  Ideally, 
this set should use species with fast turnover rates (to 
provide the potential for early warnings), species 
which are directly impacted (e.g., by fishing, such as 
target species), species which are habitat-defining, 
and should include species at top trophic levels as 
these integrate and may be sensitive to a number of 
changes in their environments.  Pelagic species that 
are highly variable (e.g., in abundance) and which 
may track short-term environmental variability 
closely, may provide early warnings of changes but 
will have high noise-to-signal problems, i.e., they may 
not indicate emerging trends well.  Demersal and/or 
longer-lived species which dampen short-term 
variability may be better indicators of significant 
changes in system states.  The emerging consensus list 
of core indicators (Table 3.1.2) includes the relative 
biomass of several groups of species; the biomass

ratios among these various groups; the extent of 
habitat defining epifauna and macrophytes; synthetic 
properties such as size spectra and diversity; various 
properties from the fisheries such as total removals, 
maximum length, size-at-maturity; and biophysical 
features such as temperature, chlorophyll a 
concentrations, nutrients, and contaminants. Note this 
list includes both contextual (descriptive) and 
management (control) indicators.  The latter class of 
indicators, such as those from fishing activities, need 
to be related to the objectives (via target and limit 
reference points, directions, etc.; Fulton et al., 2004; 
Link, 2005) in order to identify the management 
actions that must be taken to achieve that objective. 
The contextual indicators provide the background for 
these actions, and may suggest how the system might 
be changing.  Many of these indicators are derived 
from fishery-independent surveys and several, in 
particular among the contextual indicators, are best 
interpreted as part of a time series.  Both of these 
points suggest that a combination of 
fisheries-dependent and fisheries-independent 
information is required, which may not be available 
for all systems.  The extent to which data are available 
in each of the PICES member countries to develop 
these sets of indicators is shown in Table 3.1.3. 
 
Moving beyond the issue of fishing to embrace 
ecosystem-based marine management will require 
developing a broader set of objectives, and their 
associated indicators, to include other human uses and 
activities in marine systems. Examples are 
contaminants, marine transport, and coastal use issues 
such as aquaculture and development.  These issues 
may be more appropriate for local- or regional-scale 
management plans although some, such as marine 
transport and non-indigenous invasive species, will 
have larger spatial scales similar to those for fishing. In 
addition, monitoring and indexing of atmospheric and 
ocean climate changes, and large-scale changes in 
ocean productivity, will also likely take a higher profile. 
The majority of these latter indices will be contextual, 
since humans are unlikely to have management control 
in the foreseeable future over climate variability.  
Much more work also needs to be done with 
developing indicators of these human uses and stresses 
on marine ecosystems, including socio-economic 
indicators that link to marine ecosystem status.

Ecosystem Indicators  Section 3 
88 PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
An example of developing indicators for this broader 
concept of EBM is the Ecosystems Considerations 
appendix prepared for the Bering Sea and Gulf of 
Alaska by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service 
(NMFS) to supplement their regional stock 
assessments (http://access.afsc.noaa.gov/reem/EcoWeb/ 
index.cfm; see also Livingston et al., 2005; 
Livingston, 2006).  This report includes information 
on climate, fishing, and individual components such 
as nutrients and marine mammals.  It also develops 
aggregate indicators of ecosystem production and 
composition from a variety of data sources. 
Ultimately, the report is planned to rely extensively on 
the indicators as well as outputs from ecosystem 
models; at present, however, these models remain in 
various stages of development and validation.  
 
The report relies heavily on using multiple indicators 
to interpret ecosystem change and processes 
influencing change.  For example, groundfish 
recruitment anomalies are evaluated relative to 
indicators of climate variability and harvest policies. 
Time trends in trophic level of the catch are weighed 
in evaluations of sources of change in groundfish 
production and size diversity.   Broad-scale ecosystem 
management objectives have been expressed, such as 
maintaining pelagic forage availability to top trophic 
predators and maintaining diversity.  However, more 
input is needed from policy-makers to define more 
specific ecosystem management objectives.   
Similarly, research is continuing to identify important 
ecosystem thresholds to define management actions.  
In the absence of such thresholds, a pilot effort to 
develop a more explicit ecosystem-based approach to 
management in the Aleutian Islands has incorporated 
indicators into a risk assessment framework as a tool 
for managers seeking to identify priority short- and 
long-term management activities (http://www.fakr. 
noaa.gov/npfmc/current_issues/ecosystem/AIFEP507
.pdf). 
 
As a caution, Kruse et al. (2006) note that most of the 
indicators mentioned above provide information on 
current conditions rather than predicting future states. 
Trends may be extended and forecasts provided for 
those indicators for which (sufficiently long) time 
series are available, but this assumes that future 
conditions (and indicator performance) will remain 
similar to past indicator performance.  This may not 
be true under progressive climate change or 
significant regime shifts in which, for example, a lack 
of significant sea ice in the Bering Sea may make this 
indicator useless for that region.  Similarly, not all 
indicators will be appropriate for all PICES regions. 
Hopefully a core set of common indicators can be 
developed, but careful selection and research on their 
application to, and appropriateness for, each region 
will be necessary.  
 
The core set of indicators in Table 3.1.2 could be a 
starting point of discussion for information to 
incorporate into future PICES North Pacific 
Ecosystem Status Reports.  In order for the indicators 
to be placed into a management context for a region, 
the main drivers of change will need to be identified 
since these may vary across regions.  These drivers 
will identify what pressure measurements (e.g., 
bottom trawling effort, catch removals, nutrient inputs, 
etc.) need to be included in addition to the ones 
already in Table 3.1.2.  
 
 
3.1.4 Communicating Indicators 
 
Developing indicators to assist with marine EBM will 
be pointless if the meaning of these indicators is not 
understood.  Developing appropriate methods to 
communicate the results and interpretation of 
indicators to other scientists, marine managers, 
policy-makers, and the public is a central task of 
developing these indicators (e.g., see the earlier 
section on “Characteristics of Good Indicators”). 
Kruse et al. (2006, p. 101) provide a group report with 
some thoughts on these issues, and the U.S. NMFS 
Ecosystems Considerations appendix explores 
different methods.  A ‘traffic light’ approach (e.g., 
Caddy, 2002; Choi et al., 2005) provides a method to 
quickly tabulate a large number of indices and 
illustrate how they are changing in time, but it also 
removes what might be important nuances and details. 
Central considerations for communicating indicators 
must be to determine the intended audience, recognise 
whether the indicators are contextual (and therefore, 
mostly for information) or management (and 
therefore, potentially requiring a management action), 
and the extent of confidence in the indicator – i.e., 
how certain are the input data and how good is the 
relationship between the indicator and the process it is 
indexing?  Ultimately, it is important to recognise the 
subjective nature of this communication process, and 
not to expect any indicator to be simply a re-statement 
of data. 
Section 3 Ecosystem Indicators 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 89 
3.1.5 Recommendations    
 
1. PICES should explore the use of the consensus 
suite of indicators (Table 3.1.2) in each of its 
regions to develop a common set of indicators to 
be included in each iteration of the PICES North 
Pacific Ecosystem Status Report; 
2. PICES should use the WG 19 Ocean 
Management Activity reports and Fishery 
Science Committee (FIS) and Marine 
Environmental Quality Committee (MEQ) inputs 
to help identify region-specific drivers of change 
and pressure measurements in order to interpret 
status indicators in Table 3.1.2;  
3. PICES should establish collaborations with social 
scientists to develop socio-economic indicators 
which include the effects marine EBM, such as 
cost-profit and employment in fishing activities. 
The ultimate goals should be to develop 
indicators which describe the coupled marine 
social-ecological system.  
4. PICES should recommend a research activity to 
explore the use of additional indicators for marine 
EBM in each of its regions, building from those 
outlined here and in the U.S. Ecosystem 
Considerations appendix.

4.1 Introduction 
 
With marine ecosystems facing increasing and often 
unsustainable human demands, the need for 
comprehensive, integrated cross-sectoral resource 
management becomes ever clearer (Duda and 
Sherman, 2002).  Many hold that the most responsible 
strategy is ecosystem-based management (EBM), 
wherein factors such as ecological interactions, 
socio-economic forces and human impacts are 
explicit components of monitoring, assessment and 
policy.  While EBM has been variously defined by 
many authors, some concepts are pervasive across all 
definitions:  it is spatially discrete; it is adaptive; it 
incorporates dynamics, interactions and uncertainty 
associated with physical, chemical and biological 
constituents; it emphasizes sustainability; and it 
considers human objectives, activities and impacts to 
be essential components (Arkema et al., 2006).  
Because accounting for spatially explicit trends, 
processes and relationships is a main component of 
EBM, it follows that the spatial characteristics of 
marine ecosystems should be identified in order to 
provide a context for identifying stakeholders, 
defining objectives, conducting research, and 
implementing policies focused on sustainable 
management of species, goods and services (Juda, 
1999; FAO, 2003, NOAA, 2004).  
  
The six member countries of PICES are all moving 
toward EBM of marine resources (section 2), and 
must therefore, identify and characterize discrete 
areas of marine waters at scales relevant to scientists, 
managers, policy makers and stakeholders.  This 
challenge is complicated by several factors.  First, 
abiotic and biotic components of ecosystems are 
inherently dynamic in space and time.  This fact is 
especially important in ecosystems that are structured 
by major coastal or ocean currents, as is the case for 
many of the large marine ecosystems (LMEs) in the 
PICES region (e.g., Sherman and Tang, 1999).  Such 
spatio-temporal dynamics will likely be altered by 
global climate change, though in different ways in 
different areas of the North Pacific.  Second, marine 
ecosystems typically extend hundreds of kilometers 
offshore and often beyond the exclusive economic 
zone (EEZ) of a country.  In many cases, the EEZs of 
multiple nations occupy the same ecosystem, often 
adjoining along extensive international borders.  This 
fact can limit the ability of a country to monitor the 
full spatial extent of the ecosystem beyond its own 
territory, which in turn limits understanding of overall 
ecosystem function, structure and change.  A related 
problem is that different countries may have different 
monitoring practices or objectives within the same 
ecosystem, which complicates ecosystem-scale data 
synthesis and interpretation.  Finally, because EBM is, 
by definition, a multisector endeavor (Arkema et al., 
2006), it must account for suites of diverse resources, 
some of which may have very different spatial 
distribution or organization than others.  
 
The challenges outlined above must be addressed if 
integrated management of local and transboundary 
ecosystems is to be achieved by PICES countries.  
That necessity is underscored by the Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the UN, which 
states that the first step of an ecosystem approach to 
fisheries management is to identify the fisheries and 
the geographic area in which they exist (FAO, 2003).  
The same general statement could be applied to EBM 
of any resource.  In practice, the FAO (2003) 
acknowledges that identifying the geographic area is 
an adaptive and iterative process, given that 
ecosystems have ‘fuzzy’ boundaries, and can be 
defined and re-defined along a broad, subjective 
National Approaches Section 4 
92 PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
hierarchy of organization as information, objectives 
and management relationships evolve.  Nevertheless, 
it is clearly important for PICES member countries to 
engage in defining the spatial extent of marine 
ecosystems in the PICES region.  
 
In this section, we outline some of the current 
practices that PICES member countries use to 
delineate ecosystems and, in some cases, ecosystem 
subregions in their territorial marine waters.  At the 
2005 PICES Annual Meeting in Vladivostok, Russia, 
WG 19 members were asked to compile national 
approaches to delineating marine ecosystems and 
subregions and compare these to existing or planned 
management and data reporting delineations.  
National reports on this task are presented below, 
starting with the People’s Republic of China and 
moving clockwise around the Pacific Rim.  Members 
were also asked to identify cooperative and 
collaborative efforts by adjacent countries to study 
and manage cross-jurisdictional areas and resources, 
with the goal of establishing common spatial 
definitions.  We describe such collaborations in the 
Discussion, and also examine factors that will both 
impede and facilitate future collaborations.

4.2 National Summaries 
 
4.2.1 People’s Republic of China  
 
The territorial marine waters that lie east of the 
People’s Republic of China are dominated by the 
Yellow Sea and the East China Sea.  Both are large, 
relatively shallow seas that are semi-enclosed within 
an array of continental land masses, straits, peninsulas 
and islands (Fig. 4.2.1).  Oceanic and coastal currents, 
intense storms, large river inputs and high human 
population densities add considerable dynamic 
complexity to these ecosystems and affect some of the 
world’s most productive, heavily exploited fisheries 
(Chen and Shen, 1999).  Both seas are shared by 
multiple nations.

94 PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
Generally speaking, China has not formally defined or 
delineated marine regions or subregions, although its 
waters are broadly recognized as large marine 
ecosystems (LMEs) that are spatially defined by 
enclosing land masses (e.g., Sherman and Tang, 1999; 
Sherman, 2006).  The Yellow Sea LME is essentially 
bounded on the north and west by the Chinese 
mainland (north of the Yangtze River delta) and on 
the east by the Democratic People’s Republic of 
Korea and the Republic of Korea.  The Yellow Sea is 
quite shallow (mean depth d = 44 m) and lies 
entirely over the continental shelf.  Its relatively cool, 
fresh waters are fed by several major rivers, including 
the Yangtze and Huang He.  A major feature of the 
Yellow Sea is the Bohai Sea ( d = 18 m), a large gulf 
formed by the Liaodong and Shandong peninsulas and 
heavily influenced by riverine inputs.  The East China 
Sea LME is bounded approximately by the Yellow 
Sea, Korean Peninsula and Japanese island of Kyushu 
to the north, the Chinese mainland on the west, the 
island of Taiwan to the south, and the Ryukyu island 
chain to the east.  At its eastern extent is the northerly 
flowing Kuroshio Current; its southern extent 
connects to the South China Sea LME through the 
Taiwan Strait.  Compared to the Yellow Sea, the East 
China Sea is deeper ( d = 270 m) and more variable 
bathymetrically, with 81% of its area over the shelf, 
11% over continental slope, and the remainder over 
the deep Okinawa Trough to the west of the Ryukyu 
island chain.  However, nearly all of China’s 
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) waters in the East 
China Sea are shallower than 150 m.   
 
Although China has not formally delineated these 
waters, the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of physical, 
chemical and biological variables within the East 
China, Yellow and Bohai seas is well studied and 
widely documented (e.g., Su, 1998; Chen and Shen, 
1999).  Fixed spatial delineations of these waters may 
be impossible due to the seasonal complexity of 
coastal and boundary currents in the Yellow Sea and 
East China Sea LMEs (Fig. 4.2.1).  However, there 
are spatio-temporal generalizations that can be made.  
Li et al. (2006) examined over 70 years of 
oceanographic data from these waters and developed 
an index of ‘spiciness’ (the extent to which water is 
warm and salty); the equilibrium line (EL) of this 
index was intended to approximately differentiate the 
relatively cool, fresh, river-influenced Yellow Sea 
water mass from the East China Sea.  Although the EL 
generally ran southwest from the southern coast of the 
Korean Peninsula to the Chinese mainland, its shape 
and stability were highly seasonal due to the dynamics 
of at least seven regional coastal and warm currents, 
the Kuroshio Current, and seasonal monsoons.  
Ultimately, they concluded that four major water 
masses (cold and dilute, warm and salty, mixed 
coastal, and mixed warm) exist in these two LMEs; 
the water masses are associated with certain currents 
and have distinct seasonal ontogenies (Li et al., 2006).  
Su (1998) and Chen and Shen (1999) identified 
several other water masses within the East China Sea, 
seasonally defined by temperature, salinity and depth.  
Of note is a persistent mass of cool water near the 
bottom of the Yellow Sea (Su, 1998). 
 
Similarly, empirical and statistical methods have been 
used to identify zones of distinct biological 
communities in relation to large-scale environmental 
variables.  Chen and Shen (1999) concluded that 
zooplankton distributions in the East China Sea were 
controlled by the different water masses, with the 
highest zooplankton densities occurring near water 
mass convergences in the spring and summer.  Jin et 
al. (2003) used a multivariate classification method to 
identify spatial and seasonal assemblages of 
commercially important fish in the Yellow and East 
China seas.  They concluded that four distinct 
assemblages exist in spring, and four others in autumn.  
The assemblages were distinguished along two spatial 
axes:  Yellow Sea vs. East China Sea and nearshore vs. 
offshore, based on environmental variables such as 
depth, temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen 
(Table 4.2.1).  The spatial arrangements, species 
compositions and dominance of pelagic vs. demersal 
species of the assemblages varied somewhat by 
season (Jin et al., 2003), which underscores the 
spatio-temporally dynamic nature of these waters.  
Some of the differences in species composition relates 
to migratory species.  For example, the 
aforementioned persistent cool water mass in the 
central to southern Yellow Sea (Su, 1998) provides an 
overwintering habitat for many commercially 
important, seasonally migratory species in the Yellow 
and Bohai seas, including small yellow croaker 
Pseudosciaena polyactis, largehead hairtail 
Trichiurus lepturus, Japanese anchovy Engraulis 
japonicus, penaeid shrimp Penaeus orientalis, and 
several mackerel species (Zhao, 1990).  This water 
mass even supports large numbers of cold temperate 
species, including Pacific herring Clupea pallasi and 
a genetically isolated stock of Pacific cod Gadus 
macrocephalus (Grant et al., 1987).

4.2.2 Republic of Korea  
 
The Republic of Korea is surrounded by three large, 
dynamic semi-enclosed seas, each of which is 
considered an LME (Sherman, 2006).  East of the 
Korean Peninsula lies the East Sea, to the west is the 
Yellow Sea, and to the south is the East China Sea 
(Fig. 4.2.2; Huh and Zhang, 2005).  All three 
ecosystems extend well beyond the EEZ of Korea.  
General characteristics of the Yellow and East China 
seas were outlined above in the National Summary for 
China.  The East Sea is considerably deeper ( d = 
1700 m) than either of the other LMEs.  Korean 
waters in the East Sea are strongly influenced by the 
North Korea Cold Current, part of the southerly 
flowing Liman Current that originates in the Sea of 
Okhotsk; and by the Tsushima Warm Current which 
moves north through the Korea Strait and causes 
upwelling along the east of the Korean Peninsula.  
These currents meet near the 40ºN parallel, creating a 
strong frontal region (Rebstock and Kang, 2003).   
 
Delineation of Korean waters has been done primarily 
based on oceanographic characteristics.  For decades, 
National Fisheries Research and Development Institute 
(NFRDI) researchers have surveyed seasonal 
oceanographic data (e.g., temperature, salinity, 
seawater density, and zooplankton biomass at surface 
National Approaches Section 4 
96 PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
and 50-m depths) in the three seas (e.g., Zhang et al., 
2000; Rebstock and Kang, 2003).  Principal 
components analysis (PCA) and artificial neural 
network (ANN) analysis of these data revealed 
transitions among water masses (Zhang et al., 2000; J. 
B. Lee, NFRDI, unpublished data).  For example, the 
analyses spatially distinguished the relatively cool, 
fresh, river-influenced waters of the Yellow Sea from 
the warmer, saltier waters of the East China Sea and the 
even saltier, denser waters of the East Sea.  Seasonal, 
interannual, interdecadal and stochastic climate 
variability is very important in determining the size and 
strength of current and frontal systems in this area 
(Zhang et al., 2000; Rebstock and Kang, 2003).  
Surveys also reveal strong differences in the 
zooplankton communities; for example, chaetognaths 
have dominated the Yellow Sea zooplankton 
community since the 1980s, while copepods were most 
prevalent in the other seas (Rebstock and Kang, 2003).  
 
Delineation of the LMEs in Korean waters has also been 
informed by the differences among fish communities 
(Kim, 2003; Rebstock and Kang, 2003).  Importantly, 
many common fish species such as small yellow croaker 
and largehead hairtail move freely between the Yellow 
and East China seas.  Thus, those regions may be most 
appropriately viewed as distinct but interconnected 
LMEs in terms of the conservation and management of 
some marine resources.  In Korean waters of the East 
Sea, both cool water demersal and warm water pelagic 
fisheries are present, largely separated by the frontal 
region described by Rebstock and Kang (2003).  
Prominent fisheries in recent decades have included 
saury (Cololabis saira), Pacific cod (Gadus 
macrocephalus), walleye pollock (Theragra 
chalcogramma) and, more recently, mackerel and squid 
(Todarodes pacificus) (Park et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 
2000) since an apparent regime shift in the late 1980s 
that brought warmer water into the East Sea.

For management purposes, marine waters of Korea 
have been divided into subregional management 
zones by many different government agencies using 
geographic, meteorological, oceanographic and 
biological criteria.  We will follow the management 
zonation scheme proposed by NFRDI.  At the coarsest 
scale, NFRDI recognizes three general categories of 
management zones that are essentially defined by 
their distance from the coastline (Fig. 4.2.2):  offshore 
zones, which extend to the EEZ limit; coastal zones 
around the mainland and large islands, such as Jeju-do 
and Ulleung-do; and inshore zones – tidal flats, bays 
and lagoons where marine ranching occurs.  Further 
delineation of these zones is described below. 
 
There are three offshore zones in Korean waters, 
which are spatially consistent with the three LMEs 
around the Korean Peninsula (Fig. 4.2.2).  Resource 
management decisions in the offshore zones are made 
by the central government of Korea.  Management in 
offshore zones is supported by scientific research by 
regional institutes of NFRDI, in the form of regular 
surveys of oceanographic and biological variables and 
quantitative assessments of fishery resources.  In the 
Yellow and East China seas (Fig. 4.2.2; also see the 
People’s Republic of China National Summary) the 
offshore zones extend from the coastal zone to the 
seaward extent of the EEZ.  The NFRDI line that 
marks the transition from the East China Sea offshore 
zone to the Yellow Sea offshore zone extends from 
the island of Jin-do (near the southwest tip of the 
Korean Peninsula) to Chagui Island (near Jeju-do) and 
then across to the mouth of the Yangtze River (China).  
This line is geographically consistent with the 
transition between the two LMEs predicted by the 
ANN analysis (see above).  NFRDI divides the waters 
in the Korea Strait between Korea and Japan along a 
line between Ulgi Lighthouse (southeast coast of 
Korea) and the southwest tip of Honshu (Japan).  The 
remainder of this offshore zone is delineated by the 
extent of the EEZ. 
 
Coastal zones around Korea (Fig. 4.2.2) are managed 
in a largely self-regulatory manner by local 
stakeholders in the adjacent metropolitan area or 
county.  Management is supported with information 
provided by both local governments, which may 
conduct their own resource monitoring and 
assessment programs, and by the central government.  
The seaward extent of coastal zones (and thus of 
coastal management practices) may be on the verge of 
change:  coastal zones have traditionally been defined 
as waters to which fishing vessels could sail and still 
return to their home port on the same day, but the 
speed of modern vessels necessitates a more concrete 
means of delineation.  For example, some have 
suggested delineating the coastal zone as waters 
inside a fixed distance from the shore (analogous to 
the 3-nautical mile (~5.56 km) nearshore zone in U.S. 
waters which is primarily managed by individual 
states), although the distance that Korea would use is 
under debate. 
 
Finally, there are several regions, designated ‘inshore 
waters’ by NFRDI, that are used for marine ranching 
(Fig. 4.2.2).  Marine ranching in Korea began with the 
Tongyeong marine ranching project on the 
southeastern coast in 1998, following several decades 
of overfishing and environmental degradation related 
to intensive aquaculture and heavy coastal 
development (OECD, 2003).  Marine ranching is a 
process by which specific coastal fisheries are 
enhanced through science-based restoration programs 
such as stocking key life history stages of target 
species, habitat enhancement, pollution control and 
prevention of overfishing.  The management of 
inshore waters is self-regulatory.  Management 
decisions are made by a fishery committee comprised 
of the leaders of local fishery cooperatives and 
advised by scientists and central government 
representatives (OECD, 2003).  Scientists conduct 
regular surveys and assessments of the target 
resources to ensure that the decision process is 
well-informed.  The spatial extents of marine 
ranching areas have been determined through 
negotiation and joint agreement by scientists, 
stakeholders, and fishery committees.   
 
 
4.2.3 Japan 
 
Marine waters around the perimeter of Japan are 
dominated by major ocean current systems, 
semi-enclosed seas, and open coast (Fig. 4.2.3).  The 
Japanese approach to ecosystem definition and 
delineation explicitly distinguishes pelagic 
ecosystems, which are dominated by the dynamics of 
the circulation regimes, and demersal ecosystems, 
which are somewhat more fixed and characterized by 
the bathymetry of the seas and coastlines.  
 
The coastal and ocean currents around Japan create 
four different pelagic regions that can be 
characterized generally in space (Fig. 4.2.3), although 
their inherently dynamic nature makes precise 
delineations difficult.  Two pelagic regions derive

from the Kuroshio Current, which flows northeast 
from the East China Sea toward the island of Kyushu.  
Before reaching Kyushu, much of the current turns 
east-northeast and forms a boundary current, known 
as the Kuroshio Extension, that constitutes one 
pelagic region along the southeast coasts of Kyushu, 
Shikoku and Honshu.  The smaller Tsushima Current 
breaks off from the Kuroshio Current and forms a 
second pelagic region.  It flows northeast between 
Japan and the Korean Peninsula, moves along the 
west coast of Kyushu and Honshu, and then moves 
clockwise around the northern tip of Honshu, through 
the Tsugaru Strait, and southward along the east coast 
of Honshu.  The Tsushima Current is warmer and 
more nutrient-poor than the southerly flowing cold 
currents on the western side of the Japan Sea, and 
exhibits 6-year cycles of variability in its flow path 
(Terazaki, 1999).  A third pelagic region is formed by 
the Oyashio Current LME in northeastern Japanese 
waters.  The Oyashio Current brings colder, fresher 
water southwest from the Bering Sea and Kamchatka 
regions to the east coasts of Hokkaido and Honshu, 
and then partly recirculates counterclockwise and 
back to the northeast (Yasuda, 2003).  The fourth 
pelagic region is formed by a portion of the Oyashio 
Current that continues south and meets the Kuroshio 
Extension.  This junction is known as the 
Kuroshio-Oyashio Transition Area, a complex 
mixed-water region influenced by numerous 
interacting currents, fronts and mesoscale eddies 
(Yasuda, 2003). 
 
The distinctive oceanographic characteristics of the 
four pelagic regions support characteristic fauna that 
further help to distinguish the regions from adjacent 
waters.  The spatial differences in the regions are not 
simply two-dimensional.  Zooplankton species 
composition, a key indicator of the dominant current 
in an area, varies by depth as well as by latitude and 
longitude.  In particular, there appear to be 
region-specific crustacean zooplankton communities 
above and below 200 m depth (Table 4.2.2); these 
communities are made up of species generally 
associated with particular ocean zones (neritic, 
oceanic, mesopelagic, bathypelagic) and/or climatic 
regions (subarctic, subtropical, tropical). 
 
As with crustacean zooplankton, certain gelatinous 
zooplankton, squid, and pelagic fish are associated 
with the pelagic regions (Table 4.2.2), and their 
distributions can thus help to define the extent of the 
regions.  For example, the giant jellyfish Nemopilema 
nomurai is most closely associated with waters of the 
Tsushima Current. Japanese common squid 
Todarodes pacificus which spawn during the fall are 
also common in the Tsushima Current, although the 
winter-spawning common squid population is 
spatially ubiquitous in Japanese waters.  Several fish 
species associated with warmer currents spawn in the 
southwestern portion of the Kuroshio Current and 
then move either into the Tsushima Current or along 
the Pacific Ocean side of the islands.  These species 
include Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus, 
chub mackerel Scomber japonicus and jack mackerel 
Trachurus japonicus; for management purposes, the 
Tsushima and Pacific groups are treated as separate 
‘stocks’ although there is little evidence of genetic 
differentiation.  The Pacific stock of chub mackerel 
uses northerly regions extensively, with large feeding 
grounds in the Oyashio and Transition Area regions.  
Yearling jack mackerel from the Pacific stock are 
highly dependent on food resources in the Transition 
Area. 
 
Demersal zones around Japan are delineated into six 
regions which are defined in more precise spatial 
terms than the pelagic zones.  These spatial 
delineations derive from bathymetric and 
zoogeographic features.  Important among these are 
the channels that separate the major seas in the area 
(Fig. 4.2.3).  The Tsushima/Korea Strait forms a 
natural separation between the demersal regions in the 
relatively shallow East China Sea and the western 
waters of Kyushu and Honshu.  The east side of the 
Soya Channel in the north marks the beginning of the 
Sea of Okhotsk.  Other significant large-scale 
zoogeographic features include Noto-hanto, a 
northward-pointing peninsula on the west coast of 
Honshu in the waters of the Tsushima Current, and 
Inobu-saki, a peninsula at 35º42 ′ N latitude on 
Honshu, which marks the point at which the island 
angles sharply to the north and the southwest and is 
considered the breakpoint between the two demersal 
regions on the east (Pacific) coast of the main islands.  
The significance of these two features as 
zoogeographic boundaries is clear from the 
differences in demersal fish and invertebrate 
communities that are targeted by commercial fisheries 
on either side of them (Table 4.2.3).  On the east coast 
north of Inubo-saki, and on the west coast north of 
Noto-hanto, cold-water species are prevalent (in 
particular, walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma).  
Southwest of these points, the composition of major 
commercial species shifts.  The demersal community 
shifts further upon moving into the East China Sea, 
where shallow warm-water species prevail.

Thus, pelagic and demersal regions in the Japanese 
EEZ are generally defined by oceanographic patterns, 
bathymetry and species assemblages.  However, in 
coming years it is possible that Japanese waters will be 
further (and more precisely) subdivided, based on 
jurisdictional boundaries.  Fishery resource 
management in Japan was long handled by 
self-regulating limited-access fisheries, rather than 
formally managed by government management 
agencies, but that is changing.  Science-based fisheries 
management advice is currently generated both at local 
scales, by prefecture governments, and at the national 
level, by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries (MAFF).  Policy implementation at local 
scales may induce spatial changes in community 
structure or productivity within a region.  For example, 
in the 1990s the Akita Prefecture (north of Noto-hanto) 
initiated several successful actions to rebuild the 
population of sailfin sandfish Arctoscopus japonicus, 
including fishery closures, stock enhancement and 
spawning habitat improvements. 
  
 
4.2.4 Russia  
 
Russian territorial waters in the Far Eastern seas 
(Fig. 4.2.4) and adjacent waters of Pacific Ocean 
occupy part or all of four LMEs in the PICES region:  
the Western Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea 
of Japan/East Sea and the Oyashio Current (Sherman 
et al., 2007).  The Far Eastern seas are critical to the 
nation’s fishing industry, averaging over 70% of total 
Russian fish and shellfish production between 
2000–2005 (Sinyakov, 2006) despite accounting for 
just under 43% of the whole of the Russian EEZ.  
Historically, a variety of criteria have been used to 
geographically delineate the Russian EEZ into 
fisheries management regions (FMRs) and ecological 
districts although the integration and overlap of those 
delineations is somewhat limited. 
 
At the largest scale, Russian FMRs are based on FAO 
Major Fishing Areas, which delineate major 
geographic complexes of fisheries.  Based on the 
spatial distributions of key commercial target species 
for Russian fleets (Karedin, 2001), the Major Fishing 
Areas were first divided into smaller FMRs and 
sub-areas in 1975, prior to global establishment of 
EEZs.  The basic idea of FMR delineation was that a 
spatial unit would encompass the area inhabited by 
one commercial fishery stock, corresponding to a 
biological population.  It was assumed that this 
method of delineation would also sufficiently 
encompass the key distributional features of other 
species about which less was known.  Further study of 
population structure, seasonal migrations, and 
ontogenetic migrations of key commercial species led 
to a refinement of FMR delineations, first in 1980 and 
again in 1988, although to some extent they still 
reflected the original single-species framework.  The 
refined FMR patterns were also established to account 
for the potential spatial limitations of fisheries 
following the establishment of EEZs.  The current 
FMR pattern, established in 1989, is the most 
elaborate (Fig. 4.2.4), although the changes relative to 
prior FMR patterns were not done, based on scientific 
analyses or recommendations.  Rather, they were 
adopted according to the initiative of the State 
Industrial Fisheries Association (Dalryba) to solve 
discrepancies between stakeholders in the Sakhalin, 
Kamchatka and Magadan regions.  
 
Prior to the 1980s, Russian studies of commercially 
fished species were single species in nature.  
Biological and statistical information was primarily 
summarized and compared across existing FMR units, 
or was pooled at the scale of larger geographic regions 
(e.g., regional seas).  The concept of delimiting the 
Far Eastern seas into ecological districts arose in the 
1980s, stemming from oceanographic studies of 
biological productivity.  In early research on the 
ecological differentiation of global ocean habitats, 
Russian oceanographers introduced the term ‘natural 
oceanic region’ to describe an area with relatively 
homogeneous climatic, hydrologic and chemical 
conditions, which formed the backdrop for biological 
processes, community structure and ecosystem 
function (Muromtsev and Gershanovich, 1986; 
Gershanovich et al., 1990; Shuntov, 2001). 
 
In the 1980s, Dr. Vjatcheslav Shuntov of the Pacific 
Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography 
(TINRO-Center), Vladivostok suggested division of 
the Far Eastern seas and adjacent Pacific Ocean 
waters into biostatistical districts (Fig. 4.2.5) in order 
to better integrate community ecology, ecosystem and 
applied fisheries research.  This system of delineation 
was facilitated by studies of surface water circulation 
patterns, bottom relief, and distribution of water 
masses, identified by thermal and salinity 
characteristics.  The proposed system of biostatistical 
districts was broadly accepted by the scientific 
community, and has been permanently adopted for all 
TINRO-Center reports as well as in hundreds of 
scientific articles and at least five monographs on 
community and ecosystem themes (Shuntov et al., 
1993; Shuntov, 1998, 2001; Dulepova, 2002; Ivanov 
and Sukhanov, 2002).

PICES Scientific Report No. 37 103 
The biostatistical districts in Russian EEZ waters can 
be pooled into three general groups:  Western Bering 
Sea districts, Sea of Okhotsk districts and Pacific 
Ocean districts.  The Western Bering Sea has 13 
biostatistical districts that lie over the inner shelf 
(mean depth d <80 m), the outer shelf and slope ( d = 
209–356 m), and deep-sea domains ( d = 2745– 
3577 m).  Region XIII extends to a central portion of 
the sea, adjacent to a body of water that lies beyond 
the EEZs of either Russia or the U.S. (the so-called 
‘Donut Hole’).  The Sea of Okhotsk has 14 districts, 
most of which cover continental shelf ( d = 101–273 
m) or slope ( d = 343–503 m).  Additionally, two 
districts adjacent to the Kuril Islands chain cover 
narrow insular shelf and slope but also a considerable 
amount of deep-sea waters ( d = 1607 and 2171 m), 
and two districts in the central part of the sea have 
d of 1122 and 2934 m.  The Pacific Ocean districts lie 
along the eastern side of the Kamchatka Peninsula and 
Kuril Islands (Fig. 4.2.5a), and also in Russian waters 
of the northwestern part of the Sea of Japan (Fig. 
4.2.5b, Volvenko and Kafanov, 2006).  Ten districts 
lie off the Kamchatka Peninsula and Kuril Islands, 
half of which cover shelf and slope ( d = 107–420 m), 
and half of which cover deep-sea habitat ( d = 
2879–5118 m).  Another seven districts in the 
northwestern portion of the Sea of Japan (Volvenko 
and Kafanov, 2006) correspond to shelf ( d = 99–141 
m), shelf/slope ( d = 296–368 m), or deep sea ( d = 
1427–2879 m).  Spatially aggregating data in these 
districts was faciliated by Volvenko (2003) who 
calculated the areas inside the 100-, 200-, and 500-m 
isobaths for all 44 districts.  Quantitative information 
on the nekton species distribution and abundance in 
these waters has been calculated and published as a 
series of atlases and tables (most recently Shuntov and 
Bocharov, 2006a,b). 
 
Although it was hoped that the biostatistical districts 
would be used to spatially integrate basic and applied 
research, in practice they have not been used for 
fisheries management despite their potential usefulness 
for applications such as area closure measures.  The 
1989 FMR delineations (Fig. 4.2.4) are still generally 
applied for that and other fishery management 
purposes.  Some changes to the current FMR pattern 
were suggested by an ichthyofaunal zoning analysis by 
Karedin (2001) but were not adopted.  Similarly, a 
recent ichthyofaunal zoning study of the northwestern 
Sea of Japan revealed spatial similarities to the 
biostatistical districts (Volvenko and Kafanov, 2006) 
and implied a much greater degree of spatial 
heterogeneity in the fish communities than that of the 
FMR pattern.  There have been some recent changes to 
the existing FMR delineation, related to coastal fishery 
formalization.  In late 2004, a new federal law allocated 
quotas to Russian coastal fisheries, distinguishing them 
from commercial fishery quotas; coupled with the new 
coastal allocation was the establishment of new coastal 
fisheries zones which extend from the coastline to just 
over 22 km (12 nautical miles) offshore within Russian 
territorial waters.  Although fishers from coastal 
communities have appealed for the expansion of this 
zone, changes are not foreseen in the near future. 
 
 
4.2.5 United States of America – Alaskan 
Waters 
 
Continuing clockwise around the North Pacific Rim, 
we next come to the U.S.  Because U.S. territorial 
waters are geographically separated by Canada, we 
will treat the northerly waters (Alaska) and the 
southerly waters (Pacific Coast) separately, with the 
Canada section in between.  Before describing Alaska, 
we offer a brief overview of the U.S. approach to 
marine ecosystem delineation, which will serve as a 
backdrop for both reports from the U.S. 
 
The U.S. is engaged in an ongoing process of 
developing criteria to facilitate management of 
ecosystem components that exist at different scales, 
are managed by multiple agencies, and are valued by 
diverse stakeholders.  The National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which is the 
primary agency responsible for stewardship of coastal 
and ocean resources, appointed a working group to 
solicit guidance from within NOAA and from other 
federal, regional and state organizations on various 
science-based ecosystem delineation schemes 
(NOAA, 2004).  This group generally supported the 
use of LMEs to delineate ecosystems in the U.S. EEZ 
(Fig. 4.2.6), and endorsed use of the main 
classification criteria that define LMEs (bathymetry, 
hydrography, productivity and trophodynamics).  
Ecosystems in the PICES area that result from this 
delineation approach are:  Alaska ecosytem complex 
(Eastern Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands, and the Gulf of 
Alaska), the California Current, and portions of the 
Insular Pacific Islands, which are primarily in the 
central and eastern tropical Pacific and extend into the 
Southern Hemisphere.  The NOAA working group 
explicitly recognized that international cooperation 
would be necessary to achieve an ecosystem approach 
to management in some of these areas (NOAA, 2004). 
National Approaches Section 4 
104 PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
 
Fig. 4.2.6 U.S. large marine ecosystem (LME) boundaries derived from a regional ecosystem delineation workshop held 
by the NOAA Regional Ecosystem Delineation Working Group in Charleston, South Carolina, August 31–September 1, 
2004 (NOAA, 2004;  http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/sars/improvement/pdfs/ecosystem_delineation.pdf). 
 
 
The working group also identified the need to 
delineate subregions in each of the LME-level 
ecosystems.  A workshop convened in 2005 began the 
process of subregional delineation (Wendy Gabriel, 
NOAA, Northeast Fisheries Science Center, Woods 
Hole, MA, pers. comm.).  It produced a draft list of 
four general criteria for defining and describing 
subregions: bottom topography and physiography; 
circulation and oceanography; biological 
characteristics; and characteristics of the coastal area, 
inland extent, watershed, and marine catchment.  
These criteria were similar to the LME boundary 
criteria, but also included the additional criterion of 
the inland extent of the marine ecosystem.  The 
criteria were proposed to be established at two levels:  
a national minimum standard, such that a general level 
of consistency would be used to define subregions 
throughout U.S. LMEs, regardless of whether they are 
data-rich or data-poor; and regionally essential 
criteria that are relevant to specific LMEs.  No further 
action has resulted from the initial workshop.  
However, there is wide recognition that final 
delineation will need to occur at the subregional level, 
and that delineation decision-making will include 
input from regional stakeholders. 
 
Alaska is bounded to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to 
the south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the west by a 
large semi-enclosed sea (Fig. 4.2.7); the vast EEZ 
around Alaska extends into four different LMEs:  the 
Eastern Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Chukchi Sea and 
Beaufort Sea (Sherman, 2006), the first two of which 
are in the PICES region.  Several major currents and 
frontal regions influence Alaskan waters, with 
intensity that varies seasonally, annually and 
decadally.  Its highly complex coastline extends for 
nearly 10,700 km.  In many places, its jurisdiction 
extends to international boundaries with Russia or 
Canada.  For these and other reasons, defining and 
delineating subregions in Alaskan waters is 
particularly challenging.  
Section 4 National Approaches  
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 105 
 
Fig. 4.2.7 Proposed delineation of ecosystem subregions in marine waters around Alaska, based on work by Piatt and 
Springer (2007). 
 
 
There have been numerous efforts to define 
subregional boundaries in Alaska.  In 1999, 
conservation groups (The Nature Conservancy and 
World Wildlife Fund) hosted a workshop to delineate 
Bering Sea subregions with a purpose to identify 
priority areas for conservation.  Piatt and Springer 
(2007) evaluated known information on bathymetry 
and summer biological features and hydrography to 
derive 26 subregions for Alaska marine waters (Fig. 
4.2.7).  They acknowledged that these boundaries are 
likely variable but are determined mainly by bottom 
topography and current flow.  Alongshelf boundaries 
were determined primarily from topographically 
defined fronts while cross-shelf boundaries were 
determined based on patterns in animal distributions.   
Piatt and Springer (2007) also concluded that 
coastal-shelf environments are much more 
heterogeneous than the open ocean, as is reflected by 
the finer spatial scale of subregions along the coast of 
the Gulf of Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, and the 
Eastern Bering Sea (Fig. 4.2.7).     
 
In the meantime, a number of subregional boundaries 
have been defined to implement ecosystem-based 
protection measures designed to protect Steller sea 
lion (Eumetopias jubatus) foraging areas, corals in the 
Aleutian Islands, Eastern Bering Sea fish habitat, and 
a variety of closures to protect specific fish species 
from harvest during certain seasons (Witherell and 
Woodby, 2005).  These subregions were based on 
biological information on species distribution and 
knowledge of fisheries activities in the area.  The 
practical application of subregional boundaries by 
management authorities, such as the North Pacific 
Fishery Management Council, exemplifies the 
conclusion reached by the U.S. working group on 
regional ecosystem delineation that subregional 
delineation should be primarily the responsibility of 
the stakeholders in each region.  The U.S.’s fishery 
management council system incorporates science- 
based decision making that brings together a 
cross-section of stakeholders in its design of 
management actions (see http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ 
councils/).

4.2.6 Canada 
 
Classifying marine systems is a main element of 
marine research and integrative resource management 
under Canada’s national Ocean Strategy (Powles et 
al., 2004).  Thus, of all the PICES member countries, 
Canada has probably taken the most formal approach 
toward describing and delineating its marine waters.  
Their approach has involved dividing marine waters 
into adjacent ‘ecoregions’; based on the hierarchical 
organization shown in Table 4.2.4 (based on Harper et 
al., 1993), an ecoregion is an area on the scale of a 
marginal sea, distinguishable from neighbouring 
areas by physical and chemical conditions (e.g., 
temperature, salinity), key systemic rates (e.g., 
primary production), and community composition.  
An ecoregion can be a component of an ‘ecoprovince’ 
(e.g., a major oceanic surface current), or a collection 
of several ‘ecodistricts’ (a localized mixing region).  
An ecoregion is assumed to be the most complex 
association of similar, connected areas for which clear, 
ecosystem-level research and management objectives 
can be devised and implemented.  
 
Canada defined four ecoregions along its West Coast 
(Fig. 4.2.8), using nationally developed criteria 
(Powles et al., 2004) that update earlier ecoregional 
delineations done by Zacharias et al. (1998).  The 
criteria are geological (e.g., degree of enclosure, 
bathymetry, surficial geology), oceanographic (e.g., 
temperature, ice cover, freshwater influence, water 
masses, currents, mixing/stratification) and biological 
(e.g., primary productivity, species distributions, 
population structure, community structure).  These 
properties were used to classify an area of ocean only 
if data were available throughout that area, and they 
were considered jointly, not hierarchically.  Although 
the ecoregional maps end at the limit of the Canadian 
EEZ for management purposes, the geological, 
physical, and biological properties inherent to an 
ecoregion very likely extend beyond the EEZ into 
adjacent waters (Powles et al., 2004). 
 
The four Canadian ecoregions are the Strait of 
Georgia, the Southern Shelf, the Northern Shelf and 
the Pacific Offshore ecoregion.  The Strait of Georgia 
is primarily defined by its high degree of enclosure; it 
is bounded between Vancouver Island and the 
mainland of British Columbia on the west and east, 
and bordered by archipelagos and shallow depths in 
the north and in the south (Fig. 4.2.8).  Its physical 
oceanography is characterized by strong tidal fronts to 
the north and south, along with significant freshwater 
influence coming from the Fraser River.  The 
freshwater plume in the Strait of Georgia is generally 
restricted to the upper few centimetres of the water 
column. 
 
The Southern Shelf ecoregion, located off the West 
Coast of Vancouver Island, is defined at its northern 
limit by Brooks Peninsula (northwest coast of 
Vancouver Island), which extends almost to the 
200-m bathymetric contour and thus almost divides 
the continental shelf.  The southern boundary was not 
defined under the Canadian process, as this ecoregion 
extends out of the EEZ into U.S. waters.  Juan de Fuca 
Strait, between southern Vancouver Island and the 
northwest corner of the continental U.S., is a 
transition zone between the Strait of Georgia and the 
Southern Shelf.  Biologically, the Southern Shelf 
ecoregion represents the northern distribution limit of 
many species, including Pacific hake Merluccius 
productus, some pandalid shrimp Pandalus spp., and 
the southern resident stock of killer whale Orcinus 
orca.

The Northern Shelf ecoregion is bounded on the south 
by Brooks Peninsula, and extends northward into 
Alaskan (U.S.) waters.  A distinctive geological 
feature of this ecoregion is the shallow water area 
located between the Queen Charlotte Islands  (Haida 
Gwai) and the mainland coast.  Oceanographically, 
shallow waters east of the Queen Charlotte Islands 
create a warm water front and strong mixing.  
Biologically, this ecoregion is roughly the southern 
range limit of many species, including the northern 
resident stock of killer whales.  All major seabird 
colonies (colonies with >10,000 birds) on the West 
Coast of Canada occur north of Brooks Peninsula.

The Pacific Offshore ecoregion is the area seaward of 
the 200-m bathymetric contour, past the shelf break 
and to the west of the Northern and Southern Shelf 
ecoregions.  Circulation patterns effectively divide it 
into three subregions, defined by the splitting of the 
easterly flowing North Pacific current as it approaches 
North America.  This splitting results in part of the 
current going northward towards Alaska, and part 
turning south towards the continental U.S.  This 
results in a northern subregion, the Alaska Gyre, 
associated with upwelling; a southern subregion, the 
California Gyre, characterized by downwelling; and a 
transition zone near the continental shelf boundary at 
the fork.  The locations of these subregions move 
northward and southward seasonally and 
interannually with shifts in the current (Batten and 
Freeland, 2007).  Biologically, the shelf break is an 
important boundary for seabirds.  Species such as 
Laysan albatross Phoebastria immutabilis and many 
other Procellariiforms are found mostly seaward of 
the shelf break. 
 
These four ecoregions provide spatial templates in 
which Canada plans to conduct EBM of marine 
resources.  Canada recently began five ecoregion- 
scale pilot projects to implement integrated 
management (IM) plans; three of the pilot IM areas 
are in Atlantic waters, one in the Arctic and the fifth is 
the Northern Shelf region described above.  The initial 
focus in the pilot projects is to provide managers and 
stakeholders with the best available scientific 
information on the ecoregion in order to support 
decision-making.  To do so, scientists have conducted 
an Ecosystem Overview and Assessment (EOA; see 
appendix 4; Lucas et al., 2006).  An EOA is a two-part 
document.  The first part is a detailed description of 
the ecoregion’s ecological status and trends, in the 
context of the region’s geological, oceanographic and 
biological properties.  The second part is an ecological 
assessment that reviews significant human activities 
and threats, links human activities with ecosystem 
functions, identifies ecologically significant areas and 
species, and makes recommendations concerning 
areas and activities that are high priority for 
management actions.  Overall, the EOA also serves to 
engage stakeholders, and to assist in identifying 
ecosystem objectives, knowledge gaps, and ways to 
fill those gaps.  
 
4.2.7 United States of America – Pacific 
Coast 
 
Waters off the Pacific Coast of the continental U.S. 
are entirely within a single large marine ecosystem, 
the California Current LME (Sherman, 2006).  The 
California Current is an eastern boundary current that 
crosses the northern and southern borders of the U.S. 
and extends seaward of the EEZ to roughly 1000 km 
from the coast.  The surface current flows south, 
parallel to the coastline, from north of the 
U.S./Canada border until roughly Point Conception 
(Fig. 4.2.9) where it continues south-southwest to join 
with equatorial currents (Hickey, 1998).  
South-southeast of Point Conception and landward of 
the main body of the California Current is the 
Southern California Bight, characterized by a 
counterclockwise gyre that branches off the 
California Current and either recirculates (the 
Southern California Eddy) or rejoins the main current.  
The physical oceanographic features that define the 
Southern California Bight are most strongly 
developed in the summer and late fall in a normal year 
(Hickey, 1998; Hickey et al., 2003). 
 
At present, California Current waters off the Pacific 
Coast have not been formally subdivided for federal 
management purposes.  However, a panel of federal 
and state scientists recommended delineating 
subregions within LMEs for the purpose of more 
effective resource management (NOAA, 2004).  
Several bathymetric and coastal features would be 
logical points for subregional delineation because 
they mark changes in physical and biological 
characteristics.  Most notably, Point Conception (Fig. 
4.2.9) is the point on the coastline where the main 
body of the California Current diverges, and is also 
considered the transition point between two 
biogeographic provinces – the Oregonian Province to 
the north and the Californian Province to the south 
(e.g., Burton, 1998).  Several other coastal features 
mark transitions in circulation, ecosystem function 
and community composition (e.g., the Columbia 
River plume, Cape Blanco, Cape Mendocino, Point 
Arena and Monterey Bay).  Some coastal areas are 
marked by strong upwelling, a critical driver of 
primary and secondary productivity in most years 
(Barth et al., 2007).  The U.S. GLOBEC program long 
ago recognized three major regions in the California 
Current.  These regions, defined by patterns of 
circulation, coastal morphology, freshwater inputs 
and productivity, have break points at Cape Blanco 
 
Section 4 National Approaches  
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 109 
and Point Conception (US-GLOBEC, 1992).  One 
treaty-based international organization, the North 
American Commission for Environmental Cooperation 
(CEC), proposes three subregions on the U.S. Pacific 
Coast, with break points at Cape Mendocino and Point 
Conception; CEC subregion classification criteria are 
summarized in NOAA (2004).  
 
Resource management in the California Current LME 
(especially for commercial species and species of 
concern) is already done based on subregional 
delineation in many cases, largely on the basis of 
distance from shore, depth, zoogeographic breaks and 
substrate/habitat types.  Management responsibility 
for nearshore (<5.56 km, or 3 nautical miles, from 
shore) waters largely falls to individual states, and to 
the federal government from 5.56 km to the edge of 
the EEZ.  Depth zones are a key basis for management 
of demersal species in federal waters over the 
relatively narrow continental shelf.  This includes 
limits on the diameter of trawl footrope rollers (to 
prevent fishing on rocky substrates) and seasonal 
bottom trawling closures within certain bathymetric 
contours along the entire coast, in order to conserve 
depleted stocks of rockfish Sebastes spp. (PFMC, 
2004).  Coastal features mark differences in 
management strategies for some species;  for example, 
many groundfish are managed more strictly to the

north of Cape Mendocino (PFMC, 2004).  Other 
restrictions occur in areas where there is high 
likelihood of incidentally catching depleted or 
protected species (such as cowcod Sebastes levis, 
Klamath River fall Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus 
tshawytscha or leatherback turtles Dermochelys 
coriacea). Large-scale closures for bottom-contacting 
fishing gears have been established for unique 
offshore areas (e.g., seamounts and banks identified 
by NOAA for groundfish conservation) and for vast 
areas believed to be rich in deep-sea invertebrates 
such as cold water corals, sponges, anemones and sea 
pens (e.g., NOAA, 2005).  It is likely that these 
species are distributed based on subregional 
differences in geology, oceanography and community 
structure, which may serve as bases for further spatial 
delineation as this process evolves. 
 
 
4.2.8 Discussion 
Comparison of National Approaches 
 
In general, the National Summaries from the PICES 
member countries suggest a broad consistency in the 
criteria used to define and delineate marine 
ecosystems in their territories.  In nearly all cases, 
spatial delineations were associated with major ocean 
currents, depth zones, and continental shelf/slope 
areas, all of which are obvious sources of spatial 
structuring.  Many of these areas were further 
validated by statistical identification of distinct, 
characteristic species assemblages.  Coastal features 
such as capes or peninsulas were frequently identified 
as key reference points for delineation, often because 
they represent zoogeographic barriers or points at 
which large-scale circulation patterns change 
markedly.  Additionally, all member countries 
acknowledge cases where ecosystems extend beyond 
their EEZ, either into another country’s EEZ or into 
international waters.  Perhaps not surprisingly, the 
National Summaries contain less information about 
waters that lie beyond continental slopes and outside 
of their EEZs, even in cases where those waters are 
deemed part of the same ecosystem as (and are thus 
thought to be ecologically linked to) waters lying 
nearer to shore; this issue has been encountered in 
other spatial classification efforts (e.g., Spalding et al., 
2007). 
 
What is perhaps most interesting about the delineations 
is that PICES countries approached the issue in several 
different ways and yet came to comparable conclusions 
about the levels of ecological organization that 
constituted ecosystems and subregions.  Delineation in 
some areas has relied primarily on an informal 
“Delphic” approach (i.e., consensus of expert opinions) 
while other areas have added quantitative approaches 
(e.g., neural network analysis or multivariate statistics).  
It is clear, however, that the PICES member countries 
vary widely in the formality of their approaches and the 
extent of their progress with respect to ecosystem 
delineation and subregionalization.  The potential 
consequences of this are discussed in section on 
“International Collaborations”. 
 
There were several cases where member countries 
used the LME delineations as coarse-scale guides and 
defined finer-scale subregions.  The coastal and 
inshore zones around Korea, the proposed 
conservation subdivisions around Alaska, the 
Canadian ecoregions, and the biostatistical districts 
around Russia occur at considerably finer spatial 
scales than the LMEs.  Many countries noted the 
importance of variability in regional boundaries, such 
as the seasonal changes in water masses and fish 
assemblages described in the National Summary of 
China.  That distinction is important because it 
recognizes that processes near the center of an 
ecosystem may be very different from processes at the 
margins, a principle that may help guide future 
refinements to delineations (e.g., explicitly 
classifying some areas as transition zones, as was 
done by Japan and Canada). 
 
Unique among the national approaches was the 
delineation scheme described by Japan.  
Acknowledging the inherent variability of the 
seasonally dynamic boundary and coastal currents, 
Japan loosely defined four pelagic zones based on 
three-dimensional oceanographic and biological 
patchiness relative to surrounding waters.  In the 
demersal zone, however, Japan distinguished six 
zones, separated by distinct zoogeographic 
boundaries, such as shallow straits and peninsulas and 
supporting different benthic fish and invertebrate 
assemblages.  This general notion, that the delineation 
of the pelagic zone does not necessarily precisely 
overlie delineations in the demersal zone, is 
potentially applicable in other parts of the PICES area.

PICES Scientific Report No. 37 111 
Comparisons with Other Spatial Delineation 
Frameworks 
 
Many other researchers and organizations have 
developed regional delineations of the oceans (see 
summaries in Longhurst, 1998 and Spalding et al., 
2007), and our work overlaps considerably with some 
and departs from others.  Here, we draw comparisons 
and distinctions between our efforts and some 
prominent work by other individuals or groups. 
 
As is clear from the National Summaries, the North 
Pacific LME framework (Sherman and Tang, 1999) 
strongly influenced our efforts.  This implies broad 
acceptance of the LME-related suite of general 
structuring forces that define large, coastal marine 
ecosystems (bathymetry, hydrography, productivity 
and trophodynamics).  One member country, the 
United States, explicitly identified the LME criteria as 
central to its plans for regional delineations.  However, 
several countries clearly believe that managing 
marine resources will require finer-scale delineation 
of ecosystem subregions, as well as accounting for 
migratory species that move between LMEs (e.g., 
largehead hairtail and small yellow croaker in the 
Yellow and East China seas).  Two countries, Japan 
and Canada, also identified transition zones, where 
boundary current LMEs either converge or diverge, as 
distinct regions of ecological or management interest.   
 
To a great extent, following the LME paradigm is 
sensible because the LME network is closely 
associated with the coastal, continental shelf regions 
of the world’s oceans (Sherman, 2006) and hence is 
also associated with the EEZs of coastal nations like 
the PICES member countries.  This also may explain 
why the much larger-scale oceanographic provinces 
defined by Longhurst (1998) do not correspond as 
well to the delineations described in the National 
Summaries.  The Longhurst Provinces were 
developed to partition the entire world oceans, 
including the open pelagic regions far from continents, 
and hence processes at very different scales than those 
within coastal LMEs are being considered. 
 
Recently, Spalding et al. (2007) developed a 
classification scheme known as the Marine 
Ecoregions of the World (MEOW), which defined 
232 coastal marine ecoregions worldwide, based 
primarily on taxonomic criteria.  MEOW ecoregions 
(areas with high taxonomic homogeneity, particularly 
at the level of sedentary species) are nested in a 
hierarchical analytical framework where ecoregions 
are components of taxonomic provinces and 
provinces are components of taxonomic realms.  This 
system was designed to provide a basis for analyzing 
patterns and processes that characterize and influence 
marine biodiversity, and to inform management and 
conservation efforts in coastal waters.  Its hierarchical 
framework enables analysis of changes and 
differences at multiple scales, and its basis in 
quantifiable taxonomic variables makes its 
classification criteria somewhat more concrete than 
qualitative, relative criteria.  Spalding et al. (2007) 
described several differences between their network 
of ecoregions and the currently defined LME network 
(e.g., Sherman, 2006), in part because the MEOW 
system covers considerably more coastal regions and, 
in part, because the criteria for delineation are 
different.  However, Spalding et al. (2007) found that 
roughly half of their ecoregions, alone or in aggregate, 
were highly congruent with LMEs.   
 
In general, the Northern Pacific Rim ecoregions 
identified by Spalding et al. (2007) were similar to our 
formally and informally delineated ecosystems.  The 
congruence is highest in the western Pacific, where 
Spalding et al. identified separate ecoregions for the 
East China Sea, Yellow Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of 
Okhotsk, Kuroshio Current and Oyashio Current 
(Spalding et al., 2007).  There were some minor 
differences; most notably, the MEOW system 
identified four separate ecoregions along the eastern 
side of Japanese waters, extending from seaward of 
the Ryukyu island chain northward to the east coasts 
of the main islands (Spalding et al., 2007), as 
compared to the three areas (Kuroshio, Oyashio and 
Kuroshio-Oyashio Transition) identified in Japan’s 
National Summary.  MEOW also did not classify the 
central part of the Sea of Okhotsk because it lay 
beyond the MEOW criterion for ‘coastal’ waters 
(<370 km from a coastline).   
 
In the Bering Sea and eastern Pacific waters, there 
was greater (but not insurmountable) incongruence 
between our approach and MEOW.  MEOW 
delineations of the Western and Eastern Bering Sea 
ecoregions differed substantially from the Western 
and Eastern Bering Sea LMEs (Sherman, 2006), and 
the MEOW system did not include the Bering Sea 
Donut Hole, again because it lay beyond 370 km from 
a coastline.  In U.S. waters, MEOW ecoregions were, 
in aggregate, similar to the LMEs of both the Gulf of 
Alaska (where MEOW defined two ecoregions:  the 
Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands) and the 
California Current (where MEOW defined three 
National Approaches Section 4 
112 PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
ecoregions, with break points at Cape Mendocino and 
Point Conception).  These differences are related, in 
part, to the fact that the U.S. has yet to formally define 
subregions within the LMEs around its coasts.  
Finally, the four ecoregions defined in the National 
Summary of Canada were only partly captured by the 
MEOW process:  MEOW did distinguish the Strait of 
Georgia from other Canadian territorial waters, and 
also distinguished the north–south break at Brooks 
Peninsula, but did not identify the Pacific Offshore 
ecoregion or its subregions as defined in Canada’s 
National Summary.  These differences likely reflect 
specific local knowledge or management priorities 
identified in the Canadian process that would not have 
been a part of the global classification criteria of the 
MEOW effort. 
International Collaborations 
 
A key goal of this summary was to identify 
opportunities for PICES member countries to 
collaborate in managing marine ecosystems that span 
international borders.  Occurring on both sides of such 
borders are activities or conditions (e.g., primary 
productivity, anthropogenic nutrient inputs, fishing 
pressure, habitat status) that affect resources on the 
other side.  Ecosystem-based management explicitly 
accounts for the spatial distribution of processes and 
resources; thus, responsible collaborative 
management of an ecosystem by two or more 
countries requires that they share comparable ideas of 
how ecosystem resources and processes are arrayed in 
space and time (Juda, 1999; Duda and Sherman, 
2002).  Ecosystem delineation provides a useful 
spatial framework for developing national and 
international research and management plans and 
activities.   
 
WG 19 identified several examples of international 
resource management (particularly of fisheries) in the 
PICES area.  The U.S. and Canada have shared 
treaty-based cooperative management of several 
transboundary species, including Pacific halibut 
Hippoglossus stenolepis since 1923; sockeye salmon 
Oncorhynchus nerka and pink salmon O. gorbuscha 
bound for the Fraser River since 1985; and the 
abundant, highly migratory Pacific hake Merluccius 
productus since 2003.  Japan and Korea  share jointly 
fished zones in shared seas, and China and Korea  
share jointly fished zones in the East China Sea and 
Yellow Sea.  The Convention on Conservation and 
Management of Pollock in the Bering Sea, signed in 
1994, established a means for international 
management and conservation of walleye pollock in 
international Bering Sea waters; signatories include 
China, Japan, Korea, Russia and the U.S.  China, 
Japan, Korea and the U.S. are also included in the 
membership of the Asia Pacific Fisheries 
Commission, established through the FAO in 1948.  It 
has a broad agenda related to sustainable fisheries 
development, research, coordination and com- 
munication (see http://www.apfic.org).  The United 
Nations and World Bank-funded Global 
Environmental Fund (GEF) recently endorsed a 
proposal entitled “Reducing Environmental Stress in 
the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem” that will 
support the governments of China and Korea in 
cooperative efforts to sustainably manage fisheries 
and mariculture, reduce pollution, and promote 
responsible oil, shipping and tourism industries in the 
Yellow Sea LME (Duda and Sherman, 2002; GEF, 
2004).  The outcome of this project may provide a 
model for other international collaborations in the 
PICES region. 
 
Ecosystem-based management will require more 
collaboration by PICES member countries in the 
multinational LMEs typical of the North Pacific.  We 
suspect that international collaboration will be most 
complicated in the western North Pacific, owing to 
ecological structuring forces as well as 
socio-economic and governance issues.  In the eastern 
North Pacific, where Canadian and U.S. waters 
intersect in two places, the borders cross a continental 
shelf that is very narrow relative to the longshore 
extent of the boundary current ecosystems.  Thus, 
these cases involve two nations with comparable 
governance and socio-economic structures, similar 
marine resources, and small geographic areas that 
require co-management.  This is not to say that the 
U.S. and Canada always practice cooperative, 
transparent management of transboundary marine 
resources.  It does, however, represent a simpler 
condition than that of the western North Pacific, 
where several semi-enclosed ecosystems are shared 
by three or four member countries, often with 
profound differences in governance structure, 
economic development, levels of scientific 
involvement, and degrees of dependence on marine 
resources.  Their EEZs often meet over continental 
shelf waters, which tend to be the most heavily 
exploited and stressed marine systems in this densely 
populated area.  The political boundaries themselves 
may be uncertain due to territorial disputes.  These 
complications further underscore the value of the 
generally similar science-based approaches to 
Section 4 National Approaches  
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 113 
ecosystem definition and delineation used by China, 
Japan, Korea and Russia. 
 
Several institutions and frameworks can support 
additional international collaboration.  Clearly, 
PICES is a forum for scientists to exchange 
information, to identify critical data gaps, and to 
discuss elements of possible cooperative monitoring 
programs (e.g., useful ecosystem and fishery 
indicators, optimal spatio-temporal allocation of 
monitoring effort, data reporting formats, etc.).  
Another significant resource is the experience gained 
from the ‘five-module approach’ to LME assessment 
(Sherman, 1995; Sherman and Duda, 1999; Duda and 
Sherman, 2002).  In this process, variables and 
indicators in three focal science-based modules 
(productivity; fish and fisheries; pollution and 
ecosystem health) are monitored in support of 
gathering basic information, assessing risk, and 
making decisions.  A socio-economic module links 
ecological dynamics and resource management to 
economic principles that might operate under various 
management regimes.  A governance module 
considers national and international institutions, 
activities and mores that determine how resources are 
used, how constraints and opportunities are assessed, 
what behaviors are acceptable, and who is responsible 
for implementing policies and programs (Juda, 1999; 
Duda and Sherman, 2002).  Finally, management 
strategy evaluation (MSE) provides an analytical 
framework for assessing the outcomes of potential 
management actions.  MSE involves defining a set 
ecological and economic objectives, selecting 
management strategies that can achieve those 
objectives, quantitatively analyzing the trade-offs 
among management alternatives, and specifying 
performance measures that indicate management 
success (Sainsbury et al., 2000).  Spatially explicit 
ecosystem models, such as Atlantis (e.g., Fulton et al., 
2005) or Ecospace (Christensen and Walters, 2004) 
which feature management routines, are often used in 
MSE, and may prove vital tools for synthesizing 
available information and developing holistic 
management plans for marine ecosystems that span 
international borders.  International research 
organizations like PICES are ideally suited to develop, 
refine and distribute these types of large-scale, 
data-intensive modeling tools.  
 
  
4.2.9 Conclusions 
 
As PICES member countries move toward 
ecosystem-based management of marine resources at 
a national and international scope, they are 
undergoing the crucial step of partitioning marine 
waters into ecologically cohesive, manageable spatial 
units.  Although some member countries have taken 
more formal approaches than others, all members 
seem to have embraced similar criteria for delineating 
ecosystems and ecosystem subregions.  The outcomes 
described in the National Summaries are also 
encouragingly similar to widely accepted 
classification schemes such as the LME network 
(Sherman, 2006) and the MEOW network (Spalding 
et al., 2007).  At least two major challenges remain, 
however, for formal delineation of ecosystems and 
subregions in the PICES area.  First, the member 
countries need to determine the priority of developing, 
defining and implementing a standardized template 
for ecosystem delineation.  Currently, such a template 
does not exist and its priority, both within individual 
countries and within PICES, remains unclear.  Second, 
the delineation schemes described above were largely 
prepared by fisheries ecologists and likely reflect 
biases of the authors.  The limitations and 
consequences of those biases would need to be 
addressed, likely through inclusion of a broader 
family of disciplines.  As these two challenges are 
addressed, PICES experts and member countries 
should carefully consider the advantages and 
disadvantages of existing delineation schemes and 
identify criteria (abiotic, biotic, economic, etc.) and 
structural frameworks (qualitative, quantitative, 
hierarchical) that will facilitate national and 
international marine resource management.

Section 5 Summary 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 117 
 
5 Summary 
 
This document expands in greater detail the progress 
each of the PICES member countries are making 
towards the implementaion of ecosystem-based 
management (EBM) within their EEZ.  None of the 
countries to date have achieved full EBM, and it is 
readily apparent that because of differing national 
management objectives, EBM is being approached 
quite differently across the North Pacific.  As 
discussed in the earlier Study Group report (Jamieson 
and Zhang, 2005), fishery management objectives in 
China, Japan and Korea are largely focused on 
maximising food production from the sea to meet the 
demands of their large human population’s food needs, 
whereas in Canada and the United States, maintaining 
healthy populations of species in all trophic levels is 
recognized as the major EBM objective, even if this 
sometimes means closing fisheries to allow for 
population recovery.  These different management 
approaches are perhaps best illustrated with respect to 
how invasive species are determined.  There is broad 
agreement that invasive species are harmul to the 
‘desired ecosystem’, and in the eastern Pacific they 
are defined as non-indigenous species. In the western 
Pacific, any species, non-indigenous or indigenous, 
whose abundance increases so that it becomes 
disruptive to existing fisheries is considered 
undesirable and invasive.  This could therefore 
include significant increases in abundance of native 
jellyfish or harmful algal species, situations which, 
while also not desirable in the eastern Pacific, would 
not be dealt with by authorities focusing on what they 
define as invasive species.  This difference may be 
subtle, but it serves to illustrate how different events 
or situations may be responded to differently by 
resource and research managers.  
Through the process of documenting the diversity in 
EBM approaches shown by PICES member countries, 
it should be possible over time to discern which EBM 
approaches work well and which do not work under 
particular circumstances.  This report establishes a 
baseline for each country against which future 
progress can be measured, and rate of achievment of 
objectives determined.  We believe this is a key 
achievement, as it will assist in future studies, such as 
are being contemplated for PICES’ new integrative 
science program on Forecasting and Understanding 
Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific 
Marine Ecosystems (FUTURE).  There are three key 
questions that FUTURE will be addressing, namely: 
1. What determines an ecosystem’s intrinsic 
resilience and vulnerability to natural and 
anthropogenic forcing? 
2. How do ecosystems respond to natural and 
anthropogenic forcing, and how might they change 
in the future? 
3. How do human activities affect coastal ecosystems 
and how are societies affected by changes in these 
ecosystems? 
 
They all relate to or influence the ultimate success of 
achieving effective EBM, so it will be interesting to 
document over time how either marine systems and/or 
management approaches of human activities change. 
Because of information presented in this document, it 
should be possible to evaluate in the future the 
consequences of anthropogenic influences on regional 
marine ecosystems.  
  
 
Summary Section 5  
118  PICES Scientific Report No. 37  
5.1 Recommendations for Looking beyond WG 19 
 
We discussed how the findings and work of WG 19 
could best be integrated and built upon within PICES 
in years ahead, particularly within the context of the 
new PICES integrative science program on  
Forecasting and Understanding Trends, Uncertainty 
and Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems 
(FUTURE); please see http://pices.int/members/ 
scientific_programs/FUTURE/FUTURE-main.aspx). 
Development of ecosystem-based management is still 
very much in its early stages in each of the PICES 
member countries, and so we recommend that PICES 
continue to actively monitor progress into the 
foreseeable future.  To provide a long-term forum for 
this process, we concluded that the issues addressed 
by WG 19 might justify the establishment of a new 
group, with emphasis on developing an integrative, 
science-based, ecosystem-scale understanding of the 
human dimension (across a diversity of sectors).  This 
group will be closely associated with FUTURE as an 
Advisory Panel on Anthropogenic Influences in 
Coastal Ecosystems (AICE).  We suggest that this 
new group’s emphasis be on developing an integrative, 
science-based, ecosystem-scale understanding of the 
human dimension (across a diversity of sectors) in 
FUTURE, and suggest it be called “PICES 
Understanding, Linking and Synthesis of 
Ecosystems” (PULSE).  A draft proposal for this 
proposed body with an objective, terms of reference 
and membership is: 
 
Objective  
 
To monitor and synthesize regional and basin-wide ecosystem-based management (EBM) studies and initiatives 
(ecosystem health) and to provide a forum for the integration of FUTURE-related EBM practices and their 
implementation.  
 
Draft Terms of Reference 
 
1. PULSE  (PICES Understanding, Linking and Synthesis of Ecosystems) is the scientific body responsible for the 
promotion, coordination, integration and synthesis of research activities related to the implementation of EBM 
among PICES member nations.  This goal would be accomplished by convening meetings, periodic scientific 
symposia or workshops, or by distributing information designed to foster cooperation and integration among 
existing or developing PICES programs, and possibly between and/or within member nations; 
2. PULSE will provide the scientific body to identify and improve indicators to measure progress in the 
achievement of EBM.  It will provide the forum to discuss the needs, impacts and responses of coastal 
communities in a changing marine environment, and to enhance the use of this information by governments 
and society at large.  It will also provide a forum for the connection of ecosystem monitoring  and status 
reporting of both environmental and social indicators (through linkage with MONITOR), and the subsequent 
implementation and adaptation of EBM; 
3. Scientific collaboration and coordination with other international agencies, bodies and societies that are 
engaged in either EBM or human activities that are relevant to the achievement of EBM will be undertaken. 
This will engage expertise not previously active in PICES, such as social-scientists and policy makers; 
4. PULSE will encourage establishment of other component activities, such as developing the basis for coupled 
human science-natural science models, and emerging approaches as needed to facilitate synthesis of the 
FUTURE Program. 
 
Membership 
 
We recommend a membership that will ensure core connection with PICES Committees, key expertise from the 
various disciplines involved in studying ecosystem approaches to management, and national representation.  We 
advocate a nomination process that will closely connect this group to PICES Scientific Committees, such as 
ensuring that a member or designate from each Committee and perhaps from the current Study Group on PICES 
Communications in PULSE.  There is also merit in having member participation from different sectors besides 
fishing (e.g., mariculture) and ecoregions. 
Section 5 Summary 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 119 
5.1.1 Advice on the Structure and Content 
of Future North Pacific Ecosystem 
Status Reports 
 
The Working Group also considered advice on the 
structure and content of future North Pacific 
Ecosystem Status Reports (NPESRs), and specifically 
the inclusion of EBM-related topics in status reports. 
An incremental improvement version of NPESR is 
being recommended by Science Board, and we 
recommend that enhanced information on pollution 
and socioeconomics be considered for inclusion.  We 
discussed the need to identify key pressures in each 
region, and on how indicators on status and trends 
describing human well-being should be determined, 
and concluded that further review on these topics is 
needed.  Establishment of a PICES Study Group on 
Indicators of Human Well-Being: Benefits and Health 
is recommended to assist in this effort.   
 
Criteria for selection of membership should include 
biophysical and social scientists, including in the 
latter those with strong economic, sociological and 
anthropologic expertise, with understanding of 
natural science, particularly marine science, and who 
are working on questions relating to marine 
ecosystem approaches and management issues.  
Terms of reference for such a group might include:   
1. Identify potential indicators of human-well being 
and human impacts in relation to the PICES report 
on marine ecosystem status and trends; evaluate 
the Millennium Ecosystem Report indicators for 
their appropriateness. 
2. Review how these measures might be quantified 
and standardized across member countries, and if 
the data are available to quantify these. 
3. Review how these measures can be used in 
ecosystem models and management strategy 
evaluation frameworks. 
4. Identify longer-term issues that might be covered 
by a working group on this topic (governance 
structures for implementation, etc.). 
 
Criteria for selection of membership should include 
natural and social scientists, including in the latter 
those with strong economic, sociological and 
anthropologic expertise who are working on questions 
relating to marine ecosystem approaches and 
management issues.   
 
 
5.2 Ecosystem-based Management in International Waters 
 
In the above, all details and discussion presented have 
been focused on initiatives being undertaken within 
the Exclusive Economic Zones of PICES member 
countries.  While significant progress is being made in 
these regions to address issues relates to EBM, the 
reality is that many species have spatial distributions 
in the Pacific Ocean that extend well beyond national 
jurisdictions.  For these species, effective EBM can 
only be realized if national efforts to achieve EBM are 
harmonized with similar multinational efforts in 
international waters.  To this end, many of the 
initiatives to determine appropriate EBM steps in 
national waters, such as identifying ecoregions 
(spatial areas with a basically similar mix of species 
and environment) and within them, ecologically and 
biologically significant areas and species need to be 
undertaken in offshore international waters of the 
PICES region.

Appendix 3 Terminology  
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 127 
 
Appendix 3  
 
Terminology  
 
The ecosystem literature is rich with definitions and terms. The Canadian National Workshop on “Objectives 
and indicators for ecosystem-based management” (February 27–March 2, 2001, Sidney, B.C. Canada) spent 
considerable time discussing and debating those related to the ecosystem-level objectives (Jamieson et al., 
2001; see section 2.2). The terms and definitions given in the table below are based upon those currently in use in 
the literature as well as a few new ones added at the workshop.

Management, Sidney, British Columbia, February 27–March 2,  2001. CSAS Proc. Ser. 2001/09. 
Term Definition 
Characteristic Some property of the ecosystem, separate from our measurement of it (e.g., absolute biomass 
or recruitment measures for a population) 
Delphic analysis The Delphi Method is based on a structured process for collecting and distilling knowledge 
from a group of experts by means of a series of questionnaires interspersed with controlled 
opinion feedback. 
Ecosystem The spatial unit and its organisms and natural processes (and cycles) that is being studied or 
managed 
Ecosystem-based 
management 
A strategic approach to managing human activities that seeks to ensure through collaborative 
stewardship the coexistence of healthy, fully functioning ecosystems and human communities 
[towards maintaining long-term system sustainability] by integrating ecological, economic, 
social, institutional and technological considerations 
Indicator (attribute) Quantity that can be measured and be used to track changes over time with respect to an 
operational objective. Measurable part or process (property) of a system (e.g., average 
weight of age 5 individuals of a species) 
Metric Indicator empirically shown to change in value along a gradient of human influence (e.g., a 
population’s biomass as a result of fishing activity; number of introduced (exotic) feral species) 
Multimetric index A number that integrates several metrics to indicate a “condition” factor 
Reference point Value of an indicator corresponding to a management target or threshold 
Target reference point An indicator reference point that is trying to be achieved (e.g., an estimated 
biomass of 30,000 t) 
Limit reference point An indicator reference point that if crossed results in the implementation of a management 
action (e.g., if the estimated biomass falls below 10,000 t, the fishery is closed) 
Conceptual objective General statements that are uniformly accepted by all stakeholders as desirable. They are 
specific enough that everyone will interpret them the same way, but do not specify how they 
will be measured. 
Operational objective Objective that has a direct and practical interpretation in the context of (fisheries, habitat) 
management and against which performance can be evaluated quantitatively. A specific 
statement that consists of a verb (e.g., maintain), a specific measurable indicator (e.g., 
estimated biomass), and a reference point (e.g., 50,000 t), thus allowing an action statement 
for management (e.g., maintain estimated biomass of a given forage species greater than 
20,000 t biomass).

IMPORTANT NOTICE 
 
How to use this standard Table of Content 
 
The EOA Protocol is under development; it will give explanations on the content of each chapter and section proposed in the Standard ToC. 
In the interim, the aim of this standard ToC is to provide EOA project coordinators and authors with a guidance to organize the information 
in order to describe ecosystem features and discuss environmental issues that may be observed in all Canada’s Oceans and regions. It must 
be noted that not all sections of the standard ToC may be necessary, according to the study area. Only those relevant to Ecosystem-Based 
Management should be detailed and discussed in the EOA for IM purposes. On the other hand, only overall chapters and sections are 
mentioned in the Standard ToC. Authors may want to re-organize the proposed chapters or add new sections to highlight specific features 
and/or regional issues that are considered important for meeting IM needs in the study area / at the regional scale.  
 
Additional sub-divisions can be added into a given chapter/section if necessary.

September 29–October 9, 2005 
Vladivostok, Russia 
 
2005 Report of Working Group on 
Ecosystem-based Management Science and its Application to the North Pacific 
 
 
Working Group (WG 19) on Ecosystem-based 
management science and its application to the 
North Pacific held its first meeting from September 
28-30, 2005.  The WG 19 Co-Chairmen, Drs. Glen 
Jamieson and Chang-Ik Zhang, welcomed the 
participants (WG 19 Endnote 1) and reviewed the 
agenda for the meeting (WG 19 Endnote 2).  Ms. 
Patricia Livingston, the third WG 19 Co-Chairman, 
was unable to attend due to travel interruptions 
enroute to Vladivostok. 
 
Making terms of reference useful to PICES 
(Agenda Item 2) 
 
There seems to be a significant difference between 
regions:  Japan, China, and Korea have relatively 
perturbed ecosystems, and much of the national 
emphasis is on fisheries and aquaculture;  on the 
other hand, Russia, Canada, and the United States 
seem to emphasize maintaining less-impacted, 
historical ecosystem characteristics.  Valuable 
perspectives were offered from other parts of the 
world (e.g., ICES, Australia). 
 
WG 19 proposes to produce a brochure on 
ecosystem-based management (EBM), following 
the template of the well-received approach used by 
the PICES Study Group on Fisheries and 
Ecosystem Responses to Recent Regime Shifts.  The 
brochure would be an executive summary of the 
final report of the Working Group and would focus 
on (1) the need for EBM, (2) objectives for EBM, 
(3) consequences of not moving to EBM, and  
(4) research that is needed to move towards EBM. 
 
Revision of ocean management reporting format 
(Agenda Item 3) 
 
The draft management plan was reviewed and 
streamlined to increase the focus on the general 
characteristics at the eco-region level.  For each 
section, a list of questions was prepared for 
members from each country to answer about the 
status of management in their respective 
jurisdictions (WG 19 Endnote 3). 
 
National marine ecosystem monitoring 
approaches, plans and issues (Agenda Item 4) 
 
All member countries represented at Vladivostok 
gave overviews of their existing ecosystem 
monitoring approaches (neither China nor Japan 
sent Working Group members to the meeting).  
Monitoring approaches exist in each country, 
although each identified many data gaps, difficulty 
with data accessibility, and a lack of integration 
among monitoring programs.  Dr. Elizabeth Fulton 
summarized the Australian approach to EBM-based 
monitoring.  Some member nations have 
monitoring programs, though not necessarily 
organized in an EBM conceptual framework. 
 
WG 19 proposes to establish a standardized format 
for reporting monitoring in each country, focusing 
on biological monitoring, physical monitoring, 
human influences, modeling, and ecosystem status 
reporting (WG 19 Endnote 4). 
 
Overview of the 2004 IOC/SCOR symposium on 
“Quantitative ecosystem indicators for fisheries 
management” (Agenda Item 6) 
 
Dr. Ian Perry provided a summary of a symposium 
that was held from March 31 – April 3, 2004, in 
Paris, France.  Selected papers from the symposium 
were published in the ICES Journal of Marine 
Science (2005, Vol. 62, No. 3).  The symposium 
had two major themes:  (1) to provide an overview 
of the range of indicators of exploitation and state 
of ecosystems developed for fisheries management;  
and (2) to examine scientific basis for incorporating 
indicators into ecosystem-based fisheries 
management (EBFM).  Over 100 indicators were 
proposed, and some included reference points or 
reference directions.  All papers advocated multiple 
indicators, and most indicators were derived from 
WG 19 Annual Reports Appendix 5 
136 PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
fisheries-independent surveys.  The symposium did 
not achieve consensus on which indicators to use, 
but the general consensus was that the identification 
of indicators is an important task but it is work in 
progress. 
 
Dr. Perry described the properties of good 
indicators, an eight-step procedure for identifying 
them, how to determine screening criteria, and the 
general approaches used in applying them 
(empirical vs. theoretical, which seem to converge 
on which indicators are strongest, according to 
ICES symposium papers by Drs. Jason Link and 
Elizabeth Fulton). 
 
Dr. Fulton noted that indicators based on data from 
fishery-independent surveys are not available in all 
parts of the world because countries cannot afford 
them.  Models and empirical studies suggest that 
restricting the choice of indicators to 
fishery-dependent data can result in incorrect 
conclusions being drawn from the indicator data.  
Therefore, priority should be placed on the use of 
fishery-independent data.  There is optimism that 
this can be done, even in developing countries and 
new fisheries, because of increased capabilities of 
remote sensing and the power of coarse scale 
indicators (e.g., body size, abundance of all 
individuals in a particular functional group) that 
may be relatively easy to monitor. 
 
Discussion on eco-regions (Agenda Item 7) 
 
WG 19 discussed how to define eco-regions, based 
largely on the Canadian experience.  The 
“eco-region” definition includes a mixture of 
geological, biological and physical parameters.  
Eco-region boundaries tend to be fuzzy, not sharp, 
and indicate areas of commonality. 
 
All countries reported on progress with 
eco-regional delineation.  Canada has progressed 
farthest.  Delineation of eco-regions is in progress 
in the United States and Russia.  Korea has begun 
consideration of formal eco-regional delineation.  
All participants agreed that it would be beneficial to 
have regional plans that span national boundaries 
because many of the eco-regions in the North 
Pacific are trans-boundary or in international 
waters. 
 
Dr. Fulton discussed the Australian approach to 
bio-regionalization, a hierarchical approach that is 
defined at large scale by information on circulation 
and temperature, and adds in finer scale, ecological 
processes as you move down the 5-level hierarchy. 
 
To consider the scientific requirements for 
eco-region identification and review the existing 
Large Marine Ecosystem boundaries in the PICES 
area, WG 19 proposes to convene a  1-day 
MEQ/FIS Topic Session on “Criteria relevant to 
the determination of unit eco-regions for 
ecosystem-based management in the PICES area” 
at PICES XV.  Travel funds are requested for 1 
invited speaker to attend the session. 
 
NPRB/PICES Workshop on ecosystem 
indicators for the Bering Sea (Agenda Item 8) 
 
Dr. Perry informed about a project that was funded 
by the North Pacific Research Board to integrate 
ecological indicators in the North Pacific, with an 
emphasis on the Bering Sea.  Four activities were 
identified for a workshop to be held May 31 – June 
2, 2006, in Seattle: 
1. Involve Bering Sea and international 
communities in developing a set of operational 
objectives for southeastern Bering Sea 
ecosystem; 
2. Evaluate the NOAA/Fisheries “Ecosystem 
Considerations” chapter that is prepared 
annually for the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council and the PICES North 
Pacific Ecosystem Status Report, with the goal 
of integrating the results; 
3. Investigate methodologies to monitor 
system-wide structural ecosystem changes 
within the marine ecosystem; 
4. Identify steps in valuating indicator 
performance that improve the monitoring 
network, and integration into predictive 
models. 
 
Findings from this workshop are important for 
identifying criteria for ecosystem indicators. 
 
Action items to be completed prior to the next 
WG 19 meeting (Agenda Item 9) 
 
1. Compile national and international (e.g., 
PICES, LMEs, “Sea Around Us” project (D. 
Pauly), Longhurst) approaches (maps, 
processes used to identify area) to establishing 
science-based eco-regions, and compare these 
to existing or planned “management” regions.  
Appendix 5 WG 19 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37 137 
Gather together all delineated areas (e.g., 
fishery statistical areas, LOMAS, management 
areas, etc.) and digitize for GIS display.  
Identify areas of cooperation/collaboration 
between adjacent countries to jointly evaluate 
cross-jurisdictional areas with the goal of 
trying to establish common eco-regions.  These 
deliberations may be useful in updates of the 
North pacific Ecosystem Status Report.

WG 19 Endnote 5 
Proposal for a 1-day MEQ/FIS Topic Session at PICES XV on “Criteria relevant to the determination of 
unit eco-regions for ecosystem-based management in the PICES area” 
 
The management of human activities that impact 
ocean ecosystems requires planning and 
engagement of stakeholders to meet the objectives 
of ecosystem-based management, which in turn 
requires identification of areas to determine which 
stakeholders need to be involved in each specific 
process.  Area boundaries are typically based upon 
science (i.e. eco-regions), human community (i.e. 
coastal community composition), administrative 
(i.e. historical resource management areas) and 
international considerations (i.e. transboundary 
issues).  This session will consider the science 
requirements for eco-region identification in the 
PICES area, and we solicit presentations that:   
1) highlight national or regional experiences or 
frameworks in place for delineating marine 
sub-regions or eco-regions;  2) demonstrate the use 
of a variety of physical and/or biological criteria for 
region identification;  or 3) explain the specific 
management purposes behind various sub-regional 
identification schemes.  Session discussion will 
involve participants in reviewing the existing Large 
Marine Ecosystem boundaries of the PICES area 
and developing recommendations for criteria to be 
used in sub-regional identification in the North 
Pacific. 
 
Recommended convenors:  Glen Jamieson 
(Canada), Patricia Livingston (U.S.A.) and

Background 
 
Ecosystem-based management (EBM) of resources 
will require ways to monitor current conditions and 
predict future states.  Ecosystem indicators are 
single variables that reflect the status of broad suites 
of management activities or environmental 
conditions, and their assessment is key to 
monitoring the achievement of EBM.  Predictive 
ecosystem models can be used to hypothesize the 
responses of an ecosystem to management actions, 
to assess the sensitivities of indicators, and to 
highlight gaps in current knowledge.  This session 
brought experts together to identify criteria for 
suitable indicators and the utilities of predictive 
models, and to present candidates of indicators and 
models that are actively in use in PICES areas. 
 
Summary of presentations 
 
Thirteen of 15 scheduled oral papers were presented 
plus several posters.  Presentations included 
reviews of indicators in simulation models that 
attempted to describe key elements of entire 
ecosystems, and the ecosystem behavior that might 
result from perturbation, indicators relative to 
describing the consequences of fishing and/or 
environmental features in particular, modeling of 
specific ecosystem energy pathways, approaches to 
the identification of indicators that track ecosystem 
characteristic shifts, identification of important 
spatial areas where monitoring activities might 
most cost-effectively be focused, and the utility of 
different bioindicators for monitoring specific 
impacts. Given this diversity of papers, discussion 
was wide-ranging and reflected the challenges in 
trying to identify relevant, cost-effective and 
conceptually easily explainable potential indicators 
for evaluation of success in achieving EBM.

2006 Report of Working Group on 
Ecosystem-based Management Science and its Application to the North Pacific 
 
The Working Group (WG 19) on Ecosystem-based 
management science and its application to the 
North Pacific held its second meeting from October 
13–14, 2006, under the co-chairmanship of Drs. 
Glen Jamieson and Chang-Ik Zhang, and Ms. 
Patricia Livingston.  Dr. Christopher Harvey served 
as rapporteur.  A list of participants and the meeting 
agenda can be found in WG 19 Endnotes 1 and 2. 
 
Review of national/international approaches to 
establishing science-based eco-regions (Agenda 
Item 2) 
 
Dr. Ian Perry reviewed the definitions of North 
Pacific ecosystems put forth by PICES and other 
researchers and institutions, the different 
management zones defined by member nations, and 
how closely ecosystem boundaries and 
management boundaries matched one another.  He 
concluded that: 
 
   Ecosystem boundaries are often difficult to 
define due to the lack of fixed geography and 
due to long-term variability in non-static 
boundary-forming processes; 
   The Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) as 
defined by Sherman appear to be the most 
useful conceptualization of ecosystems for 
PICES member countries; 
   Management boundaries are generally 
consistent and complementary between nations, 
although perhaps less so in the Bering Sea and 
in the western Pacific; 
   It will be difficult to change existing statistical 
areas due to the historic value and inertia 
placed upon their usage, so PICES must build 
on historical context rather than trying to 
change it; 
   Management areas are generally much smaller 
than LMEs, but the management areas can 
generally be aggregated to reasonably 
approximate LMEs. 
 
Theoretical evaluation of the consequences of an 
artificial boundary (Agenda Item 3) 
 
Drs. Harvey and Elizabeth Fulton provided an 
update on efforts to use Atlantis, a spatially explicit 
marine ecosystem modeling software, to examine 
how different management strategies on either side 
of a jurisdictional boundary (e.g., a national border) 
affect cross-border eco-systems.  Harvey and 
colleagues are still in the process of completing an 
Atlantis model of the northern California Current, 
and therefore have yet to finish this task.  It will be 
done by next year’s Annual Meeting, either using 
the northern California Current model or one of 
Fulton’s models for Australia. 
 
National ocean management activity reports 
(Agenda Item 4) 
 
Each member country outlined the processes and 
frameworks they are using to implement 
ecosystem-based management (EBM).  A common 
problem among member countries is that the 
elements of EBM are often handled by different 
government agencies (for example, fisheries are 
managed by one ministry and environmental 
monitoring by another), and that there is often very 
little communication and collaboration between 
those agencies. 
 
As it was noted last year, there are different 
conceptual frameworks among member countries.  
In Canada, Russia and the United States, EBM is 
mainly directed at maintaining or restoring 
ecosystems to relatively pristine status, while in 
China, Japan and Korea, EBM is described in the 
context of resource enhancement.  In addition, there 
is a need for greater coordination and integration of 
management efforts, both within individual nations 
and between nations for resources that inhabit 
multi-national waters.  As within nations, different 
aspects of EBM are handled by different agencies 
or ministries, frameworks may not exist for 
coordinating those activities.  Across nations, all 
WG 19 Annual Reports Appendix 5 
144 PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
PICES member countries manage resources that 
move into other EEZs (Exclusive Economic Zones), 
and the Working Group encourages PICES to 
support the development of regional management 
plans in these multi-national areas. 
 
Two other concerns were raised by WG 19 on this 
agenda item.  Firstly, certain words (e.g., 
“ecosystem”, “integrative”) have different 
meanings and applications among different member 
countries, and a glossary of terms with agreed-upon 
definitions should be a part of the WG 19 final 
report.  Secondly, written volumes describing 
marine eco-regions and science supporting EBM 
are crucial and should be living, evolving 
documents.  However, they can grow very large and 
thus inaccessible to readers who need the 
information that they contain. 
 
National ecosystem monitoring approaches 
(Agenda Item 5) 
 
WG 19 members described highlights of their 
national monitoring plans.  Each nation has devoted 
considerable resources to monitoring programs;  
Russia and Korea, in particular, have developed 
long time series and broad spatial coverage of a 
wide range of oceanographic and biological 
variables.  Emerging issues that different nations 
are encountering include: 
   the need to better define ecosystem objectives, 
so that monitoring programs can be used most 
effectively in management; 
   the difficulty of getting managers, who are 
often in different agencies or ministries, to use 
monitoring data in decision-making; 
   maintaining funding for monitoring programs. 
 
Summaries of recent scientific meetings on 
ecosystem indicators (Agenda Items 6 and 7)  
 
Two recent scientific meetings on ecosystem 
indicators were reviewed.  Drs. Perry and Fulton 
revisited the 2004 Paris Symposium on 
“Quantitative ecosystem indicators for fisheries 
management”, which was described at last year’s 
WG 19 meeting.  They broadened the discussion to 
include new thinking on indicators.  Dr. Fulton 
stressed the value that several “types” of indicators 
have had in monitoring ecosystem change.  They 
include:  relative biomasses, biomass ratios (e.g., 
piscivores to planktivores), size spectra, maximum 
fish length, total fishery removals (or some other 
total human impact), size at maturity, biodiversity, 
and biophysical variables (e.g., Chl-a).  These can 
be rapidly measured and do not require special 
expertise or modeling to quantify.  She has 
concluded that monitoring pelagic ecosystems 
requires fewer total indicators, but signal detection 
is slow.  By contrast, demersal systems require 
more indicators but signal detection is rapid. 
 
Dr. Perry described the Bering Sea Ecosystem 
Indicators project, a PICES effort funded by NPRB 
to define objectives, a monitoring program, and 
effective indicators for managing the southeastern 
Bering Sea.  The process featured pre-workshops 
with diverse experts and stakeholders to maximize 
participation.  These meetings were preparatory to 
the PICES/NPRB Indicators workshop convened 
on June 1-3, 2006, in Seattle, U.S.A.  The project 
has produced recommendations concerning 
ecosystem objectives, socio-economic objectives, 
and communication objectives for better 
disseminating the project’s work within PICES, to 
the broader scientific community, and to the public.  
The final report will be published as PICES 
Scientific Report No. 33 by the end of this year.  It 
will include three white papers developed for the 
workshop (on “Operational objectives for the 
southeastern Bering Sea” by Gordon Kruse and 
Diana Evans, on “Toward ecosystem-based 
management of the oceans:  A perspective for 
fisheries in the Bering Sea” by Andrea Belgrano, 
Jennifer Boldt, Patricia Livingston and Jeffrey M. 
Napp, and on “Ecological indicators:  Software 
development” by Sergei N. Rodionov) and a 
summary of workshop discussions and 
recommendations.  Outcomes of the workshop have 
been used by NPRB in developing an integrated 
ecosystem research plan for the Bering Sea. 
 
It was recommended that WG 19 should focus not 
on choosing specific indicators, but rather on 
developing a scientific process by which proper 
indicators are defined for a given ecosystem, such 
that the process can be readily developed and 
implemented in an EBM framework. 
 
Content of the WG 19 final report (Agenda Item 
8) 
 
The final WG 19 report, due prior to the 2008 
PICES Annual Meeting, will include a general 
introduction, national definitions of EBM, and a 
glossary listing and defining key terms.  It will then 
Appendix 5 WG 19 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37  145 
summarize activities toward meeting the WG 19 
Terms of Reference (TOR).  Reporting plans for 
TORs are detailed below: 
 
TOR #1:  Describe and implement a standard 
reporting format for EBM in each PICES country.  
The report will include:  (1) national definitions of 
EBM;  (2) national objectives for EBM;  (3) 
descriptions of how objectives are made operational 
in each country;  (4) reports on national ocean 
management activities;  and (5) a synthesis that 
describes similarities and differences among 
national approaches.  The Working Group no longer 
feels it is practical to create a standard reporting 
format because it would be prohibitively 
labor-intensive, so this aspect of the term of 
reference will not be considered further. 
 
TOR#2:  Review existing definitions of eco-regions 
and identify criteria used for defining ecological 
boundaries.  The report will include national 
identification criteria as presented at the PICES XV 
MEQ/FIS workshop (W3) on “Criteria relevant to 
the determination of unit eco-regions for 
ecosystem-based management in the PICES area”, 
with particular attention to how national definitions 
compare with other ecosystem definitions (e.g., 
LMEs).  The brief report of the workshop is 
included in the Session Summaries chapter of this 
Annual Report. 
 
TOR #3:  Evaluate indicators from the 2004 
Symposium on “Quantitative ecosystem indicators 
for fisheries management”.  The report will present 
the WG 19 recommendations for types of indicators 
(and not specific indicators) that have been 
analyzed in publications generated since the 2004 
symposium.  The Working Group feels that this 
term should be broaden to include and integrate 
findings from the NPRB-funded PICES Bering Sea 
Ecosystem Indicators project into the final report. 
 
TOR #4:  Describe relevant national marine 
ecosystem monitoring approaches, plans, and 
models for predicting human and environmental 
influences on ecosystems.  The WG is concerned 
that much of this Term of Reference has already 
been addressed, in the PICES Scientific Report No. 
18 on “Impact of climate variability on observation 
and prediction of ecosystem and biodiversity 
changes in the North Pacific” (2001).  The Working 
Group proposes to change this TOR to:  Determine 
if national monitoring data currently being 
collected are sufficient to allow calculations of key 
indicators.  Each nation will summarize the 
monitoring approaches in one ecosystem or 
eco-region that are most representative of their 
implementation of EBM.  Tentatively, those case 
studies will be:  the Kuroshio Current (Japan), the 
Yellow Sea (Korea), the Okhotsk Sea (Russia), the 
Pacific North Coast (Canada), and the Bering Sea 
(U.S.A.).  Key indicators will be calculated for each 
system and data gaps will be identified. 
 
TOR #5:  Hold an inter-sessional workshop that 
addresses the status and progress of EBM science 
efforts in the PICES region.  For the purposes of the 
final report, we will summarize the content of a 
1-day FIS/MEQ workshop on “Comparative 
analysis of frameworks to develop an 
ecosystem-based approach to management and 
research needed for implementation” proposed for 
PICES XVI in Victoria, Canada. 
 
In addition, WG 19 will create an 8- to 10-page 
brochure that is essentially an Executive Summary 
of the final report.  It will be published in 2008, with 
the foreseen target audience to be determined later.  
We hope that the brochure will be translated into 
the languages of all PICES member countries. 
 
Planning for PICES XVI (Agenda Item 9) 
 
WG 19 proposes a 1-day FIS/MEQ workshop 
“Comparative analysis of frameworks to develop an 
ecosystem-based approach to management and 
research needed for implementation” to be 
convened at PICES XVI (WG 19 Endnote 3). 
 
The structure of the workshop would be: 
   a keynote talk summarizing activities of the 
Working Group; 
   invited talks from other PICES Working 
Groups and committees (e.g., MONITOR, 
TCODE, or parent committees) that describe 
EBM-related tools and themes developed by 
other groups in PICES; 
   invited talks from representatives of external 
institutions (e.g., FAO) that describe 
EBM-related tools and themes developed 
outside of PICES; 
   an invited talk on the constraints to 
implementation of EBM; 
   an invited talk on governance issues and 
difficulties related to EBM; 
WG 19 Annual Reports Appendix 5 
146 PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
   An invited talk on socio-economic issues 
related to EBM; and 
   Contributed talks solicited through the general 
abstract submission process. 
 
In the evening following the workshop, WG 19 
would convene for 2 hours to discuss the content of 
the workshop and incorporate it into the final 
report. 
 
The desired outcomes of this workshop are: 
   to fulfill the Terms of Reference of WG 19; 
   to promote general discussion on objectives, 
practices, and implementation of EBM in 
PICES member countries; and 
   To generate papers for a special issue or theme 
section of a prominent marine science journal, 
such as Marine Ecology Progress Series or 
Progress in Oceanography.

Proposal for a 1-day FIS/MEQ workshop at PICES XVI on 
“Comparative analysis of frameworks to develop an ecosystem-based approach to management and research 
needed for implementation” 
 
An ecosystem-based approach to management 
(EBM) is an integrated approach to management of 
land, water, and living resources that promotes 
conservation and sustainable use over a broad range 
of human activities in an ecosystem.  
Implementation of an EBM for marine ecosystems 
Appendix 5 WG 19 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37  147 
in the North Pacific Ocean requires a number of 
steps and activities.  An explicit framework that 
outlines the objectives, legal mandates, and 
institutional roles and responsibilities is essential.  
Data requirements and analytical tools need to be 
developed.  This workshop invites papers to:   
1) highlight existing national and international 
frameworks for implementation of an ecosystem 
approach to management;  2) outline the data 
requirements for such an approach;  3) describe the 
analytical tools being developed;  4) show the 
progress in communicating results of EBM 
activities;  and 5) discuss outstanding research gaps 
for making progress.  The workshop will be 
organized to allow time for keynote summaries of 
PICES Working Group 19 results, invited 
contributions from other PICES groups, insights by 
other organizations involved in providing 
integrated ecosystem advice, talks on governance 
issues and difficulties, socioeconomic issues, etc.  
During a discussion period, participants are 
welcome to advise the convenors on the desirability 
of publishing the results of the workshop in a 
leading primary scientific journal.

PICES Fifteenth Annual Meeting Workshop Summary 
 
MEQ/FIS Workshop (W3) 
Criteria relevant to the determination of unit eco-regions for ecosystem-based management in the PICES 
area 
 
Convenors:  Glen Jamieson (Canada), Patricia Livingston (U.S.A.) and Chang Ik Zhang (Korea) 
 
Background 
 
The management of human activities that affect 
ocean ecosystems requires planning and the 
engagement of stakeholders to meet the objectives 
of ecosystem-based management.  This, in turn, 
requires identification of areas to determine which 
stakeholders must be involved in each specific 
process.  Area boundaries are typically based upon 
science (i.e., eco-regions), human community (i.e., 
coastal community composition), administrative 
(i.e., historical resource management areas) and 
international considerations (i.e., transboundary 
issues).  This workshop considered the science 
requirements for eco-region identification in the 
PICES area, and presentations were solicited to:   
1) highlight national or regional experiences or 
frameworks for delineating marine sub-regions or 
eco-regions;  2) demonstrate the use of a variety of 
physical and/or biological criteria for region 
identification; or 3) explain the specific 
management purposes behind various sub-regional 
identification schemes.  Discussion involved 
participants in reviewing the existing Large Marine 
Ecosystem boundaries of the PICES area and in 
developing recommendations for criteria to be used 
in sub-regional identification in the North Pacific. 
Summary of presentations 
 
The workshop had 11 presentations, 2 of which 
were invited, that focused on the science 
requirements for eco-region identification in the 
PICES area.  Presentations highlighted national or 
regional experiences or frameworks in place for 
delineating marine sub-regions or eco-regions 
(Jamieson, Lee et. al.); demonstrated the use of a 
variety of physical and/or biological criteria for 
region identification (Fluharty, Harvey et al., Shtrik, 
Sydeman et al.); and/or explained the specific 
management purposes behind various existing 
sub-regional identify-cation schemes (Kishida, 
Livingston and Piatt, Seki and Makaiau).  Invited 
speakers discussed:  1) a hierarchical classification 
scheme that has been successfully applied across 
multiple scales and in many system types and 
whose output is becoming an accepted component 
of management support packages – both as maps 
for use in defining coherent management areas, but 
also as part of ecosystem-level modeling tools 
(Fulton), and 2) issues associated with reconciling 
overlapping biogeochemical and fisheries-based 
ecosystem typologies, and the mesh of fisheries 
management and reporting areas which may, or 
may not, in turn be related to marine ecosystem

typologies (Perry).  The workshop concluded with a 
plenary discussion of issues raised from the 
presentations with respect to criteria for ecoregion 
determination.

2007 Report of Working Group on 
Ecosystem-based Management Science and its Application to the North Pacific 
 
 
The Working Group on Ecosystem-based 
Management Science and its Application to the 
North Pacific (hereafter WG 19) held its third 
meeting on October 27–28, 2007, under the 
co-chairmanship of Drs. Glen Jamieson and 
Chang-Ik Zhang, and Ms. Patricia Livingston.  A 
list of participants and meeting agenda can be found 
in WG 19 Endnotes 1 and 2. 
 
Description and implementation of a standard 
reporting format for EBM initiatives (Agenda 
Item 2) 
 
Descriptions received from member countries were 
disparate and are being compiled into a summary.  
Still missing is a contribution from China.  WG 19 
discussed a conceptual spectrum of the 
ecosystem-based management (EBM) from single 
species fishery management to integrated 
(multi-sectoral) marine management and talked 
about trying to display national situations on the 
spectrum.  Lists of government agencies involved 
in implementing EBM are being assembled. 
 
Participants from each country were asked to 
provide Dr. David Fluharty a few paragraphs which 
outline where each nation is located on the 
Ecosystem Approach to Management (EAM) 
spectrum (sensu Sainsbury slide), including 
endangered species legislation, marine protected 
areas (MPA), or heritage site designations. 
 
Dr. Fluharty discussed the possibility of 
incorporating a list of treaties dealing with 
transboundary stock management into the report.  
This document could be enhanced by adding 
aquaculture activities and their management.  
Categories in the report are expected to include:   
(1) definitions, (2) objectives, (3) legislation and 
agencies with marine management authority,  
(4) environmental assessment requirements in 
decision making, and (5) endangered species 
protection, marine sanctuaries, national heritage or 
other MPA designation processes.  Target date for 
completion of this chapter of the WG 19 final report 
is the end of December 2007. 
 
Definitions of “eco-regions” and criteria for 
defining ecological boundaries relevant to 
PICES (Agenda Item 3) 
 
Dr. Christopher Harvey gave an update of the 
“eco-region” chapter of the WG 19 final report.  
Currently, the discussion section needs more work 
and regional figures are not yet in a common format.  
There was discussion about the World Wildlife 
Fund MEOW (Marine Ecosystems of the World) 
initiative and how this might overlap with PICES 
efforts to define eco-regions.  It was determined that 
governments of member countries are pursuing 
individual definitions and frameworks for 
eco-regions, a situation that must be highlighted.  It 
is not clear whether MEOW’s system will be 
adopted, but national efforts could be compared 
with their regions.  Some details and refinement of 
the discussion have to be finalized, but this chapter 
of the report is virtually complete, although lacking 
a contribution from China. 
 
Dr. Elizabeth Fulton presented a report on the 
consequences of ocean management scenarios that 
ignore eco-region boundaries in favour of national 
boundaries.  An artificial national boundary was 
generated between States in an existing model of 
southeast Australian waters, creating two artificial 
Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs).  Different 
management scenarios (loosely based on the range 
of management methods existing in the PICES 
region) were implemented, with contrasting options 
within these two EEZs.  This meant that there were 
two management regions that spanned parts of a 
single eco-region – with some but not all species 
moving across the border between the two 
quasi-nations.  Results for a range of indicators 
(drawn from the list constructed by Perry et al.) 
were presented.  This gave insight into the state of 
the system overall and the relative performance of 
the management methods.  Results included: 
WG 19 Annual Reports Appendix 5 
150 PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
   different levels of production with different 
management approaches (although this result 
might not occur in regions with a dominant 
signal from upwelling); 
   less biomass in forage groups if target species 
were managed sustainably and higher trophic 
levels were conserved; 
   any kind of management helps maintain target 
species biomass (vs. an unconstrained baseline 
scenario); 
   for species with even moderate degrees of 
mobility (or more), effective management in 
one “nation” subsidizes catches and biomass 
taken by the other, but is still beneficial as it 
also raises overall system state; 
   top predators benefit from more prey but this 
signal can be diffused by large scale (including 
seasonal) movements following rich prey 
sources/locations; 
   cephalopods dropped in biomass slightly 
because of increase in top predators; 
   habitat has the potential to benefit from 
management, but success is not a given (it is 
sensitive to the magnitude and specific 
implementation and types of management); 
   from an EBM perspective, management in one 
region is helpful but perhaps not as effective as 
if management was coordinated across the 
regions. 
 
One question that has not been addressed in this 
modeling work to date is whether the benefits seen 
from implementing effective management in one 
nation’s waters, even if the neighbouring country is 
not being as efficient, are cost-effective.  This 
research will be targeted for publication by Drs. 
Fulton and Harvey in the peer reviewed literature, 
however, some illustrative examples and results 
will be incorporated in the WG 19 final report to 
highlight ecosystem issues arising from differential 
management across boundaries. 
 
Evaluation of indicators and summary of 
monitoring efforts (Agenda Items 4 and 5) 
 
An overview of the indicators chapter of the  
WG 19 final report was provided, and discussion 
points were outlined and agreed upon.  The next 
step was for each member country to suggest 
whether the indicators listed in Table 2 of the 
chapter had been calculated yet for a particular 
region in each nation and whether there are data 
available to do so.  Dr. Perry will coordinate this 
effort.  Tables from some countries were finished at 
the meeting, but others will need input from 
national experts.  Most indicators were related to 
effects of fishing and not to the broader types of 
impacts from other marine sectors.  The participants 
expanded the third recommendation in the chapter 
to explore the development and use of 
socio-economic indicators.  There was discussion 
about social indicators such as the spatial 
distribution and numbers of jobs.  Those data are 
difficult to obtain in some countries.  ICES 
examples in that regard can be found in the 2006 
Report of the Ecosystem Effects of Fishing 
(Sections 4.2–4.4, pp. 92–106, Tables 4.2.4, 4.4.3).  
Indicator availability tables from each country will 
be completed by the end of December 2007 and will 
be added to this chapter of the report. 
 
FIS/MEQ workshop at PICES XVI (Agenda 
Item 6) 
 
A full report of the FIS/MEQ workshop on 
“Comparative analysis of frameworks to develop 
ecosystem-based approach to management and 
research needed for implementation” (W3) can be 
found in the Session Summaries chapter of this 
Annual Report.  The workshop made progress in 
highlighting issues related to the implementation of 
EBM in PICES member countries.  It was clear 
from the presentations that member countries are in 
different stages of EBM implementation.  Some are 
still working on incorporating an ecosystem 
approach to fisheries management, while others 
have national legislation that provides a mechanism 
for implementing cross-sectoral approaches to the 
management of marine activities to ensure 
environmental protection.  The degree of 
advancement might be related partly to the nature of 
the different human pressures being exerted on the 
marine environment.  Even some of the countries 
that appeared to be more advanced in their 
implementation mentioned problems in actually 
making cross-sectoral management work in marine 
ecosystems.  Overarching legislation that requires 
action may be needed.  It was clear that more than 
one agency was involved in EBM activities in each 
country, and a challenge is to get agencies to work 
together in implementation.  It was noted that the 
legislation that typically led to cross-sectoral 
implementation was some form of endangered 
species legislation. 
 
Data requirements for EBM were discussed.  The 
Appendix 5  WG 19 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 37  151 
Australian experience demonstrated that 
implementation could involve both highly 
quantitative approaches and models if data are 
available, but could also include methods to 
evaluate ecosystem status and potential impacts in 
qualitative ways.  The ICES experience exhibited 
how highly-evolved data gathering for EBM advice 
could be, although it was noted that highly-evolved 
advice did not necessarily translate into the political 
will to follow such advice.  MONITOR outlined 
some of the data requirements that would 
necessitate its involvement and that of all of the 
PICES Committees.  The workshop noted 
particularly the lack of socio-economic data to 
assist in decision-making in an EBM context. 
 
Analytical tools are being developed to aid in EBM, 
and these include the highly structured risk 
assessment framework of Australia that allows for 
both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of risks, 
and determinations of when action is needed.  The 
MODEL Task Team described a suite of modeling 
tools that might be used to understand impacts of 
climate variability on marine ecosystems.  Models 
such as ATLANTIS can help in the evaluation of 
management strategies, and these seem to be 
important tools to further decision-making. 
 
Communicating the results of EBM activities is 
ongoing in member countries.  Some are using 
highly-structured reporting instruments such as 
ecosystem assessment documents.  The ICES 
advisory structure communicates EBM advice in a 
tactical way that is highly evolved, although its 
success in implementing EBM might not be so 
advanced.  Reporting of ecosystem status is crucial 
but it was recognized that identification and 
reporting of ecosystem pressures and ecosystem 
responses to management are significant pieces in 
conveying EBM progress. Communicating measures 
of human health was noted to be essential in this 
regard.  The role of PICES in communicating EBM 
was seen to be more of a strategic one.  There is a 
variety of potential scales useful in reporting results. 
 
A major outstanding research gap is the need for 
social science indicators and information.  The 
advancement of risk assessment frameworks and 
tools seemed particularly important.  Perhaps 
Working Groups on Human Dimensions of 
Implementing EBM or Evaluation of Risk 
Assessment Tools and Frameworks might be 
worthwhile to consider in the future. 
WG 19 final report and 2008 inter-sessional 
meeting planning (Agenda Item 7) 
 
National submissions of the above material are due 
to January 1, 2008, after which the lead authors and 
Co-Chairmen will begin merging the data into a 
final report.  A major gap is a lack of Chinese 
submissions and lack of participation from this 
country to date.  Options relating to finalization of 
the WG 19 report are thus: 
   Get Chinese participation in an inter-sessional 
meeting in February 2008 (options Seattle or 
China); 
   Extend the Working Group for one more year 
and meet with Chinese scientists at the next 
PICES Annual Meeting in Dalian; 
   Finalize the report without Chinese input. 
 
WG 19 hopes to have a draft of the final report by 
late January to send to the Chinese prior to the 
inter-sessional meeting, so they can see what 
contribution is desired from them. 
 
After the meeting adjourned, it was realized that 
WG 19 originally intended to publish a brochure on 
EBM in 2008 but this topic was not discussed at the 
meeting.  In hindsight, such a publication would 
have been premature as the final report has yet to be 
written.  WG 19 still plans to produce a brochure 
(the concept was approved by Science Board last 
year), but after the final report is complete.  Its 
contents would be a subset of information compiled 
in the final report.  Discussion of contents of the 
brochure will be conducted either via email, at the 
inter-sessional meeting, or at next year’s Annual 
Meeting. 
 
Structure and content of North Pacific 
Ecosystem Status Report and EBM-related 
topics for inclusion (Agenda Item 8) 
 
An incremental improvement version of the 2004 
pilot report is being recommended by Science 
Board (SG-ESR Endnote 2).  WG 19 suggests 
enhancing the next report with information on 
pollution and socio-economics.  The discussion 
focused on the need to identify key pressures in 
each region, and on how should indicators on status 
and trends describing human well-being be 
determined.  Further discussion on these topics will 
be required. 
 
WG 19 Annual Reports Appendix 5 
152 PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
Establishing a PICES Study Group on Indicators of 
Human Well-being:  Benefits, Health is 
recommended to assist in this effort.  Terms of 
reference for this group might include: 
1. Identify potential indicators of human well- 
being and human impacts in relation to PICES 
marine ecosystem status and trends.  Evaluate 
the Millennium Ecosystem Report Indicators 
for their appropriateness. 
2. How might these measures be quantified and 
standardized across member countries?  Are 
the data available to quantify these? 
3. How can these measures be used in ecosystem 
models and management strategy evaluation 
frameworks? 
4. Identify longer-term issues that might be 
covered by a Working Group on this topic 
(governance structures for implementation, etc.). 
Membership for this Study Group should consist of 
qualified social scientists, primarily those with 
strong economics background, with an 
understanding of natural sciences, particularly 
marine science, who are working on questions 
relating to marine ecosystem approaches and 
management issues. 
 
Comments on FUTURE (Agenda Item 9) 
 
The participants evaluated a draft Science Plan for a 
new PICES integrative scientific program on 
Forecasting and Understanding Trends, 
Uncertainties and Responses of North Pacific 
Marine Ecosystems (FUTURE) in the context of 
advancing science and communication in support of 
EBM.  The communications aspect of this program 
is very important and should be discussed and 
outlined more clearly with a strategic view of 
identifying the audiences and appropriate methods 
of communication.  The status and trends 
information is newsworthy and needs 
communication. 
 
Models are important to project future ecosystem 
states, and the program has a heavy emphasis on 
that aspect.  WG 19 members thought that the 
deliverables for the program also have to include 
status and trend indicators and an improved, 
coordinated monitoring system to support indicator 
data requirements.  Society needs to hear about 
human health, food security, role of climate, and 
potential for unanticipated ecosystem change.

PICES Sixteenth Annual Meeting Workshop Summary 
 
FIS/MEQ Workshop (W3) 
Comparative analysis of frameworks to develop an ecosystem-based approach to management and research 
needed for implementation 
 
Co-Convenors:  Glen Jamieson (Canada), Patricia Livingston (U.S.A.) and Chang-Ik Zhang (Korea) 
 
Background 
 
An ecosystem-based approach to management 
(EBM) is an integrated approach to management of 
land, water, and living resources that promotes 
conservation and sustainable use over a broad range 
of human activities in an ecosystem. 
Implementation of an EBM for marine ecosystems 
in the North Pacific Ocean requires a number of 
steps and activities. An explicit framework that 
outlines the objectives, legal mandates, and 
institutional roles and responsibilities is essential. 
Data requirements and analytical tools need to be 
developed. This workshop invited papers to: 1) 
highlight existing national and international 
frameworks for implementation of an ecosystem 
approach to management; 2) outline the data 
requirements for such an approach; 3) describe the 
analytical tools being developed; 4) show the 
progress in communicating results of EBM 
activities; and 5) discuss outstanding research gaps 
for making progress. The workshop was organized 
to allow time for keynote summaries of PICES 
Working Group 19 results, invited contributions 
from other PICES groups, insights by other 
organizations involved in providing integrated 
ecosystem advice, talks on governance issues and 
difficulties, socioeconomic issues, etc. During a 
discussion period, participants were welcomed to 
advise the convenors on the desirability of 
publishing the results of the workshop in a leading 
primary scientific journal. 
Summary of presentations 
 
The workshop made progress in highlighting issues 
related to the implementation of EBM in PICES 
member countries.  It was clear from the 
presentations that member countries are in different 
stages of implementation with respect to EBM.  
Some countries are still working on incorporating 
an ecosystem approach to fisheries management 
while others have national legislation that provides 
a mechanism for implementing a cross-sectoral 
approach to the management of marine activities to 
ensure environmental protection.  The degree of 
advancement might be partly related to the nature of 
the different human pressures being exerted on the 
marine environment.  Even where some countries 
WG 19 Annual Reports Appendix 5 
154 PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
appeared to be more advanced in their 
implementation, there were problems in actually 
making cross-sectoral management work in marine 
ecosystems.  The need for overarching legislation 
that requires action may be needed.  It was clear that 
more than one agency was involved in EBM 
activities in each country and a challenge is to get 
agencies to work together in implementation.  It 
was also noted that the main type of legislation that 
forced cross-sectoral implementation was 
species-at-risk legislation.   
 
Data requirements for EBM were discussed to some 
extent.  The Australian experience demonstrated 
that implementation could involve both highly 
quantitative approaches and models if data are 
available but the framework could also include 
methods to evaluate ecosystem status and potential 
impacts even in qualitative ways.   The ICES 
experience demonstrated how highly evolved data 
gathering for EBM advice could be, although it was 
noted that highly evolved advice did not necessarily 
translate into the political will to follow such advice.  
The Technical Committee on Monitoring outlined 
some of the data requirements that would require its 
involvement along with the involvement of all the 
PICES committees.  The workshop particularly 
noted the lack of socio-economic data to aid in 
decision-making in an EBM context.   
 
Analytical tools are being developed to aid in 
establishing EBM frameworks.  Highly structured 
risk assessment frameworks in Australia allow both 
quantitative and qualitative evaluation of risks and 
definitions of when actions are needed.  The 
MODEL Task Team described a suite of modeling 
tools that might be used to understand impacts of 
climate variability on marine ecosystems.  Models, 
such as Atlantis,  to aid in the evaluation of 
management strategies seem to be important tools 
to help EBM decision-making. 
 
Communicating the results of EBM activities is 
ongoing in member countries.  Some are using 
highly structured reporting instruments such as 
ecosystem assessment documents.  ICES advisory 
structure for communicating EBM advice in a 
tactical way is highly evolved although reporting its 
success in implementing EBM might not be so 
advanced.  Reporting of ecosystem status is 
important but it was recognized that identification 
and reporting of ecosystem pressures and 
ecosystem responses to management are important 
pieces of communication of EBM progress.  
Communicating measures of human health was 
noted to be important in this regard.  The PICES 
role in communicating EBM was seen to be more of 
a strategic one.  There seemed to be a variety of 
scales that are potentially useful for reporting 
results.   
 
A major outstanding research gap is the need for 
social science indicators and information.  The 
advancement of risk assessment frameworks and 
tools seemed particularly important.  Perhaps 
working groups on the human dimensions of 
implementing EBM or evaluation of risk 
assessment tools and frameworks might be 
important to consider in the future.

October 24–November 2, 2008 
Dalian, People’s Republic of China 
 
2008 Report of Working Group on 
Ecosystem-based Management Science and its Application to the North Pacific 
 
The Working Group on Ecosystem-based Management Science and its Application to the North Pacific 
(hereafter WG 19) held its final meeting on October 26, 2008, under the co-chairmanship of Drs. Glen Jamieson, 
Chang-Ik Zhang, and Ms. Patricia Livingston.  A list of participants and the meeting agenda can be found in 
WG19 Endnotes 1 and 2.  WG19 Endnote 3 contains the draft Executive Summary of the PICES Scientific 
Report currently being finalized.   This Executive Summary contains the main recommendations of Working 
Group 19 at the conclusion of its work. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 2 
Discussion of Final Report 
 
The primary item on the agenda involved discussion of the completeness of the final report and the 
recommendations of the Working Group.  Status of the brochure was also discussed. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEMS 3 AND 6 
Description and implementation of a standard reporting format for EBM initiatives 
 
Working Group members went over the country profile format and Ecosystem Approach to Management (EAM) 
typology contributions.  Canada and Korea have newer contributions that need to be incorporated into the 
document.  Each country should look to make sure its contribution is still accurate after English language editing.  
Also, WG 19 needs to decide if the country contributions should be made comparable in terms of length.  Some 
contributions are longer than others.  The Ecosystem-based Management (EBM) matrix that depicts each 
country’s progress was not filled out by each country.  Should this matrix still be shown?  Members commented 
that it is difficult to report on a national basis because there are regional differences in implementation.  There are 
several issues that are not in the table at present.  For example, offshore wave energy generation, tourism and 
sportfishing are not outlined.  Mariculture may need to identify intertidal, pen culture, and onshore locations of 
the activity.  The text will be modified to describe the typology and sectors as examples. Offshore wave energy 
generation could be identified as an emerging issue in the text.  Regional implementation of EBM should 
consider the most important sectors in a particular area.  Another aspect is evaluating the social cost of EBM 
implementation.  Dr. Mitsutaku Makino will provide a paragraph about this.  Japan will contribute an example 
for one prefecture.  WG 19 members from China and Russia will be contacted to see if they are able to contribute 
a national example to this table. Contributions will need to be made before the end of the year.   
 
The Working Group consulted with Dr. Skip McKinnell about how to format the report with respect to location 
of references, appendices, and section formatting.  For now, each section will have its own specific 
recommendations and the executive summary will provide a roll-up of all the recommendations from each 
section.  Order of sections was discussed.  EAM typologies and country profiles will come first.  An ecoregion 
approach would then logically follow.  Consistency in the names of countries needs to be checked and terms of 
reference need to be verified because they were modified later.  Dr. Zhang will review the section on monitoring 
to see if anything could be added.

AGENDA ITEM 4 
Discussion of recommendations 
 
The relationship of PULSE (see WG 19 Endnote 3)  to other potential task teams of FUTURE was discussed and 
more members were nominated.  A potential Study Group or Working Group on Indicators of Well-being was 
mentioned.  The Working Group recommended that the Convenors of Topic Session on “Connecting the human 
and natural dimensions of marine ecosystems and marine management in the PICES context” (S12) bring up this 
proposed group in the discussion part of their session.  Potential members of the study group/working group 
could be some of the people presenting at S12.  WG 19 members thought that this should be a study group 
initially to help focus the work and refine membership for a follow-on working group.  A topic session for next 
year on spatial planning was discussed, and it was suggested that it be sponsored by MEQ and FIS.   
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 5 
Ecologically and biologically sensitive international marine areas in the North Pacific 
 
Drs. Akihiko Yatsu  and Jake Rice presented information on the current status of a Regional Fisheries 
Management Organization (RFMO) in international waters in the North Pacific and a joint Convention on 
Biological Diversity-International Union for Conservation of Nature (CBD-IUCN) effort that are both 
considering to look at the application of criteria for designating vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) in North 
Pacific international waters.  It appears that the RFMO is still being developed, and likely would not be able to 
initiate studies until the fall, 2009, at the earliest, while the CBD meeting to review progress on using the criteria 
in evaluation of VMEs will be in early fall, 2009.  It was suggested by Dr. Rice that PICES might therefore be 
interested in considering addressing the usefulness of the criteria in the spring, 2009. WG 19 did not have any 
comment about PICES’ possible role but agreed that species do not recognize national borders and EBM must 
extend to international waters.  The proposed designation of VMEs in international waters would be a necessary 
step in the long-term achievement of EBM in the entire North Pacific. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 7 
Brochure 
 
The brochure format was discussed.  A figure depicting the differences between single sector management, 
ecosystem-based fishery management and multisector integrated managed was suggested.  The terms EBM 
should be consistently used throughout the brochure although some mention could be made of the other terms 
that are in use.  There was also support for translating into languages of the PICES member nations and making 
those available on the PICES website.  There was some discussion on the possible perspectives and 
recommendations of the PICES Study Group on Communications about this brochure.    Members were tasked 
with looking at various sections and provide edited text.

WG 19 Endnote 3 
Looking beyond WG-19 
 
We discussed how the findings and work of WG 19 could best be integrated and built upon within PICES in the 
years ahead, particularly within the context of the FUTURE program. Development of ecosystem-based 
management is still very much in its early stages in each of the PICES countries, and so we recommend that 
PICES continue to actively monitor progress into the foreseeable future. To provide a long-term forum for this 
process, we concluded that WG 19 might most appropriately evolve into a Task Team rather than a Section 
because Task Teams report to Science Board and are more broadly distributed across all of PICES, rather than 
simply reporting to one or two committees.  We suggest that the Task Team’s emphasis be on developing an 
integrative, science-based, ecosystem-scale understanding of the human dimension (across a diversity of sectors) 
in FUTURE, and suggest it be called “PICES Understanding, Linking and Synthesis of Ecosystems” (PULSE). 
A draft proposal for this Task Team with a basic background statement, terms of reference and suggested 
co-chairs and members is: 
 
Objective 
 
To monitor and synthesize regional and basin-wide ecosystem-based management (EBM) studies and initiatives 
(ecosystem health) and to provide a forum for the integration of FUTURE-related EBM practices and their 
implementation.  
 
Draft Terms of Reference 
1. The PULSE Task Team is the scientific body responsible for the promotion, coordination, integration 
and synthesis of research activities related to the implementation of EBM among PICES member 
nations. This goal would be accomplished by convening meetings, periodic scientific symposia or 
workshops, or by distributing information designed to foster cooperation and integration among 
existing or developing PICES programs, and possibly between and/or within member nations; 
2. The PULSE Task Team will provide the scientific body to identify and improve indicators to measure 
progress in the achievement of EBM. It will provide the forum to discuss the needs, impacts and 
responses of coastal communities in a changing marine environment, and to enhance the use of this 
information by governments and society at large. It will provide a forum for the connection of 
ecosystem monitoring and status reporting of both environmental and social indicators (through linkage 
with MONITOR), and the subsequent implementation and adaptation of EBM; 
WG 19 Annual Reports  Appendix 5 
160 PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
3. Scientific collaboration and coordination with other international agencies, bodies and societies that are 
engaged in either EBM or human activities that are relevant to the achievement of EBM will be 
undertaken. This will engage expertise not previously active in PICES, such as social-scientists and 
policy makers;  
4. The PULSE Task Team will encourage establishment of other component activities, such as developing 
the basis for coupled human science-natural science models, and emerging approaches as needed to 
facilitate synthesis of the FUTURE Program. 
Suggested members  
We are seeking a structure that will ensure core connection with PICES Committees, key expertise from the 
various disciplines involved in studying ecosystem approaches to management, and national representation.  We 
advocate a nomination process that will closely connect the Task Team to PICES Scientific Committees, such as 
ensuring that a member or designate from each of the Committees, and perhaps from the current Study Group on 
Communications is in PULSE. There is also perhaps merit in having member participation form different sectors 
besides fishing (e.g., mariculture, etc.) and ecoregions.

EBM in International Waters 
 
In the above, all details and discussion presented have been focused on initiatives being undertaken within the 
Exclusive Economic Zones of the PICES member countries, and while significant progress is being made in 
these regions to address issued relates to EBM, the reality is that many species have spatial distributions in the 
Pacific Ocean that extend well beyond national jurisdictions. For these species, effective EBM can only be 
realised if national efforts to achieve EBM are harmonised with similar national efforts in shared national 
ecoregions and with multinational efforts in international waters. To this end, many of the initiatives to 
determine appropriate EBM steps in national waters, such as identifying ecoregions (spatial areas with a 
basically similar mix of species and environment) and within them, ecologically and biologically significant 
areas and species, need to be undertaken in offshore international waters of the PICES region.

PICES Seventeenth Annual Meeting Topic Session Summary  
 
MEQ Topic Session (S12) 
Connecting the human and natural dimensions of marine ecosystems and marine management in the PICES 
context 
 
Co-Convenors: David L. Fluharty (USA), Mitsutaku Makino (Japan), R. Ian Perry (Canada) and Chang-Ik 
Zhang (Korea) 
 
A complete definition of marine ecosystems includes the human components. Consideration of ecosystem-based 
management, at least within the natural sciences, usually leaves out the human dimensions, or includes it only as 
fishing effort. For ecosystem-based management to succeed, however, humans need to be included. This session 
builds on the Science Board Symposium of 2003 titled “Human dimensions of ecosystem variability”. Human 
relationships and how humans interact with the ocean have been changing in nature and strength over time. 
Natural variability in marine systems can be large, but so are socio-economic pressures and considerations 
relating to marine environments. Determining appropriate socio-economic indicators to complement indicators 
of natural climate variability, e.g. for ecosystem-based management, is an ongoing challenge. This session will 
address these interactions between natural and socio-economic issues in the context of ecosystem-based 
management. Specifically, it will consider: (1) What are the criteria to determine relevant socio-economic 
indicators of human well-being related to marine issues for PICES member countries? (2) What are appropriate 
indicators to monitor changes in management objectives and human well-being relevant to changing ecosystem 
structure and production? (3) How might decisions that are made to enhance human well-being likely to impact 
(positively or negatively) the nature and functions of marine ecosystems? This session theme will continue to 
explore the many ways that humans interact with marine ecosystems and the scientific efforts to quantify and 
predict human impacts on the dynamics of such systems.

Dr. Glen Jamieson is a research scientist at the Pacific Biological Station 
(Fisheries & Oceans Canada) who has 18 years’ experience in shellfish stock 
assessment.  His research and provision of scientific advice is currently centered 
in four general areas:  1) research in support of the establishment of marine 
protected areas (MPAs) and ecosystem-based management in British Columbia; 
2) development of appropriate steward-ship and monitoring protocols;  
3) evaluation of the population dynamics and responses of selected species, 
focusing on relatively sedentary species such as benthic invertebrates, rockfish, 
and lingcod; and 4) investigation and monitoring of the presence and impacts of 
exotic species.  Glen is a member of the PICES MEQ Committee and the 
Chairman of the Study Group on Ecosystem-based management science and its 
application to the North Pacific. 
 
Since the industrial revolution, man’s impact on the oceans 
has increased dramatically, this being especially true in 
recent years.  In near-shore coastal areas, human population 
growth has led to increasing pollution and habitat 
modification.  Fishing effects have become increasingly 
severe, with many, if not most, traditionally harvested 
populations now either fully exploited or over-fished 
(Garcia and Moreno, 2003).  Thus far, management of these 
activities has been primarily sector-focused.  For instance, 
fisheries have generally been managed in isolation of the 
effects of other influencing factors, and have targeted 
commercially important species, without explicit 
consideration of non-commercial species and broader 
ecosystem impacts.  However, there is now an increasing 
international awareness of the cumulative impacts of 
sector-based activities on the ecosystem (Jennings and 
Kaiser, 1998; Kaiser and De Groot, 2000), and the need to 
take a more holistic or ecosystem-based management 
(EBM) approach (Anon., 1999; Kabuta and Laane, 2003; 
Link, 2002) to ensure the sustainability of marine 
ecosystems.  Globally, there is an emerging paradigm shift 
in our approach to ocean management and usage (Sinclair 
and Valdimarsson, 2003). 
 
In response to the increasing awareness to look at 
cumulative environmental impacts, in October 2003, the 
PICES Science Board established, under the direction of the 
Fishery Science (FIS) and Marine Environmental Quality 
(MEQ) Committees, the Study Group on Ecosystem-based 
management science and its application to the North Pacific, 
with the following terms of reference:  
1) Review and describe existing and anticipated 
ecosystem-based management initiatives in PICES 
member nations and the scientific bases for them;  
2) Identify emerging scientific issues related to the 
implementation of ecosystem-based management;  and  
3) Develop recommendations for a Working Group to 
focus on one or more of the issues identified.  
 
The first Study Group task was to reach a common 
understanding of what the terms ecosystem and 
ecosystem-based management meant.  The following 
definitions were agreed to: 
 
Ecosystem:  The spatial unit and its organisms and natural 
processes (and cycles) that is being studied or managed. 
 
Ecosystem-based management:  A strategic approach to 
managing human activities that seeks to ensure through 
collaborative stewardship the coexistence of healthy, fully 
functioning ecosystems and human communities [towards 
maintaining long-term system sustainability] by integrating 
ecological, economic, social, institutional and technological 
considerations. 
 
Representatives from each country then submitted a 
summary of their country’s approach to EBM, and it became 
immediately obvious that challenges were different between 
China, Japan and Korea vs. Russia, Canada and the United 
States.  The greater coastal populations in the former three 
countries, coupled with their much longer history of full 
exploitation of most harvestable renewable resources, meant 
that EBM was, initially at least, focused on 1) minimising 
existing impacts, 2) rebuilding depleted stocks to more 
acceptable levels, and 3) in near-shore areas in particular, 
minimising widespread impacts in the marine environment 
from land runoff from both industrial and urban 
developments.  In contrast, in the latter three countries, 
human coastal populations and development were generally 
much less, with fishing impacts and offshore oil and gas 
PICES Press Vol 13, No. 1  Appendix 6 
166 PICES Scientific Report No. 37 
development identified as the major impacts.  In many 
instances, relatively unimpacted, pristine habitat and 
biological communities still existed, and so the challenges 
there were often how to maintain them while permitting 
appropriate new economic activity to occur. 
 
When the Study Group met at PICES XIII (Honolulu, 
October 2004), there was much discussion around three 
issues:   
1) What would be an appropriate standard format to 
document environmental impacts and initiatives to 
minimise them;   
2) How could the PICES region be subdivided into what 
the Study Group termed eco-regions;  and  
3) What indicators would be most appropriate to evaluate 
progress in achieving EBM.  
 
While it is recognised that many human activities impact the 
marine environment (e.g., fishing, mariculture, oil and gas 
exploration and development, pollution from land-based 
activities, disruption of freshwater discharges by 
urbanisation, etc.), the most comprehensive databases (e.g., 
target species landings, bycatch and discard characteristics, 
habitat disruption, etc.) as to how these impacts are affecting 
marine ecosystems are related to fishing activities.  Hence, 
much initial reporting of ecosystem impacts is likely to be 
focused on documenting and addressing fishery impacts.  
Alternate reporting formats may need to be assessed or 
developed that capture the ecosystem effects resulting from 
other human activities, and that describe how these 
ecosystem effects are being monitored.  Ecosystem 
parameters already, or potentially, being monitored may 
capture environmental change, without linking this change 
back to the specific human activity, or activities, that in fact 
might be causing the change (e.g. increasing sea water 
temperature may be the result of many causes, some of 
which relate to human activities).  In some cases, additional 
research may then be required to determine linkages.  It was 
thus proposed by the Study Group that a standardised 
reporting framework that describes human activity impacts 
be progressively applied to all fisheries in PICES member 
countries, and that the adopted reporting framework be 
robust enough to address an increasing number of 
environmental and other requirements imposed by 
legislation, certification schemes, and consumer and 
community demands.  
 
Eco-regions have been defined by Canada as “a part of a 
larger marine area (eco-province) characterized by 
continental shelf-scale regions that reflect regional 
variations in salinity, marine flora and fauna, and 
productivity”.  Biological communities between each region 
are somewhat different, but within a region, they are 
generally similar, at least on the large scale.  There would 
obviously be differences between habitats (e.g., estuarine, 
rocky, soft substrate, etc.) within an eco-region, but overall, 
the same mix of species could be expected to occur.  EBM 
approaches within an eco-region should thus strive to 
achieve the same broad conceptual objectives of trying to 
preserve the natural species mix, proportions across trophic 
levels, water quality, and so on.  Since some eco-regions 
might transgress national boundaries, this might mean that 
different countries would be trying to address the same 
ecological objectives in their own waters within the same 
eco-region.  The Study Group thus indicated that it would be 
of value to have a collective evaluation of where different 
eco-region boundaries are located. 
 
It was generally agreed that while achievement of EBM was a 
common objective, only through monitoring could the level 
of progress be actually measured.  For cost-effectiveness, 
existing monitored parameters should be first assessed as to 
their utility here, but it was recognised that new parameters, 
many associated with non-commercial species, will also have 
to be monitored.  Different national approaches to achieving 
such monitoring were briefly discussed, mostly in the context 
of initiatives to develop a process to determine an optimal 
mix of parameters to monitor. 
 
In finalising its report, the Study Group made the 
recommendation to its two parent Committees, FIS and 
MEQ, to establish a Working Group on Ecosystem-based 
management, with a 3-year duration and the following terms 
of reference: 
 
   Describe and implement a standard reporting format for 
EBM initiatives (including more than fishery 
management) in each PICES country, including a 
listing of the ecosystem-based management objectives 
of each country;  
   Describe relevant national marine ecosystem 
monitoring approaches and plans and types of models 
for predicting human and environmental influences on 
ecosystems.  Identify key information gaps and 
research and implementation challenges;  
   Evaluate the indicators from the 2004 Symposium on 
“Quantitative Ecosystem Indicators for Fisheries 
Management” for usefulness and application to the 
North Pacific;  
   Review existing definitions of “eco-regions” and 
identify criteria that could be used for defining 
ecological boundaries relevant to PICES; 
   Hold an inter-sessional workshop that addresses the 
status and progress of EBM science efforts in the 
PICES region, with the deliverable being either a 
special journal issue or a review article;  and  
   Recommend to PICES further issues and activities that 
address the achievement of EBM in the Pacific. 
 
The parent Committees and Science Board accepted these 
recommendations, and the proposed Working Group on 
Ecosystem-based management science and its application to 
the North Pacific was established in October 2004.  The 
Science Board also suggested that the full report of the 
Study Group be published as soon as possible in the PICES 
Scientific Report Series.
