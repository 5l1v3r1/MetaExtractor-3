INTRODUCTION 
 
Project scope 
 
The PICES Carrying Capacity and Climate 
Change (CCCC) BAsin Scale Studies (BASS) 
Task Team was established to facilitate studies of 
the impacts of climate change and climate 
variability on the physical and biological processes 
in the gyres of the western and eastern subarctic 
Pacific Ocean. 
 
In general, the oceanography and ecology of the 
eastern (ESA) and western (WSA) basins of the 
subarctic Pacific (Fig. 1) are poorly understood 
relative to the coastal areas.  It is known that the 
central subarctic Pacific is productive as indicated 
by the large abundance of Pacific salmon, squid 
and other important fishes.  Recent studies also 
suggest that the oceanography of the gyres is 
closely linked to the decadal scale changes in 
climate.  Therefore, it is important that there is a 
co-ordinated effort to focus on the priority 
research issues, and to exchange scientific 
information on a timely basis.

At the PICES Sixth Annual Meeting, the BASS 
Task Team sponsored a symposium on the 
Ecosystem dynamics of the Eastern and Western 
Gyres of the Subarctic Pacific.  The purpose was 
to bring together available information on the two 
gyres in a comparative framework.  Topics 
included:  
 
1. ocean responses to climate forcing,  
2. nutrients and primary production,   
3. structure of the lower trophic levels, the 
mesozooplankton communities, and the 
epipelagic nekton,   
4. the role of midwater fishes, and  
5. the importance of these areas to marine birds 
and mammals.   
 
Papers presented at the meeting were published in 
a special issue (Beamish et al. 1999a) of Progress 
in Oceanography (Guest Editors:  R.J. Beamish, S. 
Kim, M. Terazaki and W.S. Wooster). 
 
A follow-up workshop was convened in Hakodate, 
Japan (October 2000), to identify potential models 
which might have utility for examining gyre 
systems (McFarlane et al. 2001).  Trophodynamic 
linkages that were likely to be common, as well as 
those that were model-specific, were identified, 
and shortcomings were highlighted.  Discussions 
included identifying data groups and potential data 
sources, incorporating climate and oceanographic 
change in models, and linking models of the 
oceanic gyre to models of coastal regions. 
 
Participants recognized that modelling would play 
an increasingly prominent role in examining the 
dynamics of the gyres, and recommended the 
BASS and MODEL Task Teams examine the 
feasibility of using the ECOPATH/ECOSIM 
modelling approach as a means to organize our 
understanding of ecosystems of the subarctic 
gyres.  Specific objectives were to:  (a)  synthesize 
all trophic level data in a common format, (b)  
examine trophic relations in both gyres using 
ECOPATH/ECOSIM, and (c) examine methods of 
incorporating the PICES NEMURO lower trophic 
level model into the analysis. 
 
 
 
 
 
Three workshops followed in Honolulu, U.S.A. 
(March 2001), then Victoria, Canada (October 
2001), and finally in La Paz, Mexico (April 2002), 
where the ECOPATH/ECOSIM baseline models 
were developed, linked to the NEMURO model, 
and a number of hypotheses tested (see 
Appendices C to F for workshop reports). 
 
The purpose of this approach was to provide a 
“picture” of the two subarctic gyres, and to 
facilitate our understanding of how these systems 
respond to natural and anthropogenic change.  
This report presents our current understanding of 
the dynamics of these systems.  Further, this report 
should serve as an outline for data availability and 
more critically, gaps in upper trophic level 
biological data as they affect our understanding of 
the function and variation in the subarctic gyres’ 
food webs.  Finally, it is hoped that the report will 
form the basis of future work to link the subarctic 
gyre system to coastal systems. 
 
Climate change, carrying capacity and food 
web models of the subarctic Pacific Ocean 
 
The subarctic Pacific consists of a major cyclonic 
gyre surrounded on the north by coastline and 
boundary currents, and on the south by the 
Subarctic Current, which isolates the gyres from 
subtropical waters.  The main gyre is pinched at its 
longitudinal center by the Aleutian Islands, which 
causes re-circulation of its waters into two sub-
gyres: the Western Subarctic and Eastern 
(Alaskan) Subarctic Gyres (Fig. 2).  The two 
subarctic gyres are biologically distinct, 
supporting different species and production 
patterns from plankton through predatory marine 
mammals (Beamish 1999).  As such, the two 
separate ecosystems are the primary subjects for 
comparison in this report. 
 
The biological production, carrying capacity, and 
food webs of the Eastern and Western Gyres have 
been subjects of considerable speculation, 
especially given difficulty of access, and the 
relatively limited data collection performed in 
these high seas areas (Pearcy et al. 1999).  This 
interest has been driven in part by the fact that the 
gyres are a “rearing and growth” area for Pacific 
salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), and are therefore 
production areas for important commercial 
fisheries.  Additionally, the link between climate 
and fisheries on decadal (regime shift) scales 
points to important ecosystem interactions 
occurring within the gyres and in synchrony with 
Pacific-wide events (e.g., the Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation, Mantua et al. 1997).

approximate and may change on interannual time 
scales. 
 
Attempts to quantify the carrying capacity and/or 
maximum production rates of fish in the gyres 
have revealed a fundamental paradox.  
Calculations of zooplankton biomass and 
production, when compared to demands made by 
foraging salmon, the dominant fish, invariably 
indicated a surplus of available food.  Models 
constructed in the 1970s (Favorite and Laevastu 
1979) concluded that the North Pacific could 
sustain ten times the 1970s standing stock of 
salmon. 
 
Yet during the 1980s and 1990s, when the system 
contained only twice the total salmon biomass 
examined by Favorite and Laevastu, salmon sizes 
declined (Bigler et al. 1996, Ishida et al. 1993, 
Ricker et al. 1995).  Conservative production 
estimates, using observed 1980s and 1990s 
zooplankton and salmon biomass, indicate that 
adult salmon consume between 0.04% and 0.10% 
of available annual zooplankton production 
(Brodeur et al. 1999).  Since salmon are a 
 
 
 
 
dominant pelagic nekton in the region, it seems at 
a first glance unlikely that this level of 
consumption would lead to competition for prey, 
and thus represent an ecosystem at its carrying 
capacity for salmon.  However, as suggested by 
Pearcy et al. (1999), trophic and seasonal 
compression of salmon foraging opportunities may 
reveal more specific foraging limitations: 
calculations of the forage available for salmon and 
other large nekton in the gyres is re-examined 
here. 
 
Further, it is clear that environmental forcing on 
multi-year scales, for example through the PDO 
and ENSO, affects the biology of higher trophic 
levels in these ecosystems and across the globe 
(Beamish 1993; Brodeur and Ware 1995; 
Hollowed et al. 1998; Francis et al. 1998; Beamish 
et al. 1999b).  The effects of climate are not 
limited to the direct increase or decrease of the 
biomass of the entire system.  Animals with 
longer-than-annual life histories integrate short 
term changes, and their biomass may not respond 
immediately to changes in ocean conditions.  In 
order to move from correlative to mechanistic 
relationships linking climate and biology, it is 
necessary to construct models, either conceptual or 
quantitative, which account for appropriate time 
scales of interaction through the food web.  Links 
may not be linear or direct, and scale is critical.   
 
For example, the shoaling mixed layer is used by 
Polovina et al. (1995) to predict increases in 
zooplankton production based on the increased 
concentration of nutrients within the mixed layer.  
However, as Freeland et al. (1998) point out, 
while the mixed layer may concentrate nutrients 
during the spring growth of zooplankton, it may 
also limit resupply of nutrients later in the season.  
Thus, while the overall quantity of zooplankton 
production averaged annually may increase, the 
extent of the bloom throughout a season, and the 
resulting zooplankton community structure and 
transfer of energy to other portions of the food 
web, may increase for some species but decrease 
for others. 
 
To examine such indirect and possibly unexpected 
interactions, food web models are a useful tool, 
and must be scaled to account for differences in 
rates across trophic levels on both seasonal and 
interannual scales.  To accomplish this, multiple 
models should be examined in concert, with some 
models covering small or short scale dynamics 
(such as those associated with plankton dynamics), 
and some covering the annual scales of fisheries 
models.  Finally, migration models linking gyres 
with coastal areas should be used to expand the 
view to examining synchronous changes that have 
been reported in marine populations across the 
widest possible area of the North Pacific. 
 
Purposes of these models 
 
The ECOPATH models presented here are based 
on the pooling of available data from both sides of 
the Pacific Ocean.  Data from these ecosystems 
has been brought together and discussed in 
previous international workshop settings (Beamish 
et al. 1999a):  the present work represents the first 
steps in an ongoing quantitative synthesis.  These 
models provide a quantitative framework for 
cataloging these data and a guide for directing 
future data collection. 
 
Various conceptual food web models of the gyres 
have been constructed (Sanger 1972;  Pauly and 
Christensen 1996;  Brodeur et al. 1999), usually 
with a combination of quantitative and qualitative 
data.  These previous models have begun to 
address and assess the “carrying capacity” of the 
subarctic Pacific for many important species, 
especially Pacific salmon:  this work is continued 
here. 
 
More critically, in view of regime- or longer-term 
climatic change, and the acknowledged 
importance of links between climate and the 
production of Pacific salmon and other species, it 
is desirable to focus research priorities based on 
quantitative assessments of current notions of 
subarctic ecosystem sensitivities and interactions.  
Due to the difficulty of data collection in the open 
ocean, the ecological links with coastal 
ecosystems, and the necessity of strong 
international collaboration in future research of 
these ecosystems, it is useful to have a quantitative 
framework for pooling information. 
 
ECOPATH, as a tool, is a relatively 
straightforward method for constructing a 
quantitative food web for the purposes of 
 
 
 
 
hypothesis exploration and data synthesis.  The 
food webs created are similar to those created 
through other synthetic methods:  the resulting 
models represent a “snapshot” of what is 
essentially a moving target, a changing ecosystem.  
By providing the snapshot as a step in continuing 
workshops and collaborations, we examine our 
view of the ecosystem’s sensitivities to change as 
viewed and modeled through the data currently 
available.  Moreover, we are able to use this 
framework as a guide to data synthesis, by 
providing foci for continued international 
collaboration and collective research.   
 
By simultaneously presenting two models built on 
a similar framework for two different systems 
(Eastern and Western Gyres), we stress a 
comparative approach in examining the underlying 
biology and climate interactions:  these 
comparisons are emphasized in the results of this 
work.  This comparative approach is crucial to 
understanding the synchronous interactions 
(simultaneous species rises and collapses) reported 
in coastal and oceanic ecosystems throughout the 
world.   
 
The dynamic simulations presented here using 
ECOSIM include attempts to fit or model changes 
in biomass as they might occur given certain types 
of physical forcing.  In these models we attempt to 
take into account the dynamic nature of multiple 
pathways available in the food webs, and through 
the examination of simplified interannual patterns, 
to begin stretching from the correlative to the 
mechanistic relationship.  Finally, we report on the 
first stages of linking a smaller-scale nutrient-
phytoplankton-zooplankton model (NEMURO) 
with ECOSIM to partially bridge the gap between 
the seasonal production cycle and the longer time 
periods associated with regime shifts. 
 
 
 
 
 
METHODS 
 
Model setting 
 
The Eastern and Western Subarctic Gyres as 
defined by PICES are broad and heterogeneous 
areas, with currents and other oceanographic 
boundaries ensuring that multiple ecosystem 
processes occur within the gyres (Fig. 2).  
ECOPATH, on the other hand, is a “closed 
system” model that assumes spatial homogeneity.  
However, since biological data do not exist in the 
gyres for explicitly separating sub-areas, it was 
decided that two basin models, one for each of the 
west and east, would be most appropriate. 
 
The original aim was to create models that were 
targeted to “central gyre” rather than boundary 
current processes.  However, in many cases data 
for central gyre processes was unavailable.  
Specifically, in the east, the plankton data and 
driftnet fishery data were dominated by 
information near the sub-arctic boundary and 
NEMURO model calibrated to the Station P 
region (Subarctic Boundary) were used.  In the 
west, many of the surveys were dominated by both 
southern boundary processes (in the case of 
sardines and Pacific pomfret) or Kamchatka 
Current specific data (in the case of data provided 
by Russian colleagues).  Finally, for species such 
as marine mammals for which only aggregate 
North Pacific biomass estimates were available, 
species were assumed to occur in the gyres in 
proportion to their area as defined by PICES sub-
areas (Fig. 1, Table 1) rather than as defined by 
shifting oceanographic boundaries (Fig. 2). 
 
The time period chosen for the model was to be as 
close to present-day as possible;  however, when 
the project was initiated it was recognized that an 
oceanographic “regime shift” in the late 1990s 
may have occurred for which biological data was 
not yet available.  Additionally, one of the primary 
sources of data for upper trophic level fish species, 
the Japanese squid driftnet fishery, was operative 
mainly during the late 1980s.  Therefore, the target 
time period for data was chosen to be the late 
1980s/early 1990s.  While data outside this time 
period was used when necessary, data quality as 
reported in Appendix A was downgraded 
appropriately, with very little data being included 
from “pre-1976” regime conditions.

While ECOPATH is a closed-system model, it 
does allow some scope for accounting for 
migrating species, provided that migration is a 
relatively small proportion of the biomass.  
However, the dominant commercial fish species in 
the gyres, and thus a major focus for the models, 
were Pacific salmon species, all of whom leave the 
gyres for freshwater systems during the adult 
phase of their life cycle.  Rather than attempting to 
model “outside” coastal and freshwater processes, 
salmon data was calibrated to represent “within-
system” growth and mortality processes only, and 
thus the dynamics of juvenile salmon were left as 
an input to the model (rather than a derived result). 
 
Finally, pink salmon, a dominant upper trophic-
level species in the gyres, have a two-year 
high/low biomass cycle which has been shown to 
affect the diets and distribution of other species in 
the subarctic Pacific (Tadokoro et al. 1996).  
Rather than attempting to capture an “average” 
ecosystem which might never exist, it was decided 
in the first stages of the project to average high 
years only for the base ECOPATH salmon species, 
and thus capture the maximum impact that pink 
salmon might be expected to have in the system.  
However, it was not possible, due to limited data, 
to match these cycles with other species which 
might have similar cycles (such as euphausiids or 
micronektonic squid, Aydin 2000). 
 
Other specific data issues, which were revealed 
later during the modelling process, are detailed in 
Appendix A by functional group, and noted in the 
“Results and discussion” section as they might 
affect our perceptions of the model.  In general, 
the results reported are those which are relatively 
robust to changes in the above initial assumptions.  
It should be noted that, at the outset, a major goal 
of this work was to provide a “gyre-specific” 
outline for one portion of the Pacific salmon life 
cycle to guide future research.  The most 
important next step in examining subarctic 
processes will be to link these results with coastal 
and freshwater processes, and in doing so to 
examine climate/ecosystem interactions as a 
whole. 
 
 
 
Base ECOPATH formulation 
 
ECOPATH with ECOSIM (EwE) is a tool for 
constructing a food web model from fisheries and 
biological data by subjecting the data to the 
constraint of ecosystem-level mass-balance.  The 
model assists in the construction of a quantitative 
food web by ensuring that the biomass inputs and 
outputs of each ecosystem component (functional 
group or species) provide a consistent accounting 
within the specified range of uncertainty in the 
data.   
 
ECOPATH’s strength lies in its emphasis on using 
data collected and analyzed in many common 
types of fisheries analyses (especially stock 
assessment and food habits studies), and its ability 
to combine the data into a single coherent picture.  
ECOPATH is a food web analysis tool that has 
gained broad recognition as a methodology for 
assembling and exploring data on marine food 
webs (Polovina 1985; Christensen and Pauly 1992; 
Christensen et al. 2000; see the website 
www.ECOPATH.org for the latest available 
software, manuals, and list of published models).  
 
ECOPATH is a mass-balance model, built by 
solving a simple set of linear equations which 
quantify the amount of material (measured in 
biomass, energy or tracer elements) moving in and 
out of each compartment (functional group) in a 
modeled food web.  A single functional group 
(food web compartment) may be a single species 
or a set of trophically similar species.  The master 
ECOPATH equation is, for each functional group 
(i) with predators (j):

The definition of the parameters in the above 
equation, and the general methods used to derive 
each parameter, are given in Table 2.  
 
The preferred method for using the ECOPATH 
model is to input all parameters from independent 
data sources, except for ecotrophic efficiency (EE) 
for each functional group.  ECOPATH will 
estimate vector EE values by solving the resulting 
set of linear equations, with EE as the unknown 
 
 
 
 
for each functional group, utilizing the generalized 
inverse method (Mackay 1981) to guarantee a 
solution.  The estimation of EE is the primary tool 
for data calibration in ECOPATH:  independent 
estimates of consumption and production of 
different species often lead to initial conclusions 
that species are being preyed upon more than they 
are produced (EE>1.0), which is impossible under 
the mass-balance assumption (Christensen et al. 
2000).  
 
By using an EE greater than 1.0 as a diagnostic 
tool for error, it is then possible to assess the 
relative quality of each piece of input data to 
adjust inputs to a self-consistent whole.  This 
process is known as “balancing” the model:  it 
does not imply that the true ecosystem is in 
equilibrium but rather quantifies the uncertainty 
contained in the estimates of supply and demand 
present in the system. 
 
In cases where biomass or P/B ratio are unknown 
for a functional group, the EE for the group may 
be fixed (usually at a value between 0.8-1.0) and 
used to estimate the minimum biomass or 
production rate required to satisfy the consumption 
rates of the group’s predators.  In our study, this 
“minimum production” method was used only in 
cases where no reasonable estimate of biomass is 
available for a group.  
 
The mass-balance constraints of ECOPATH do 
not in themselves require or assume that the 
modeled ecosystem is in equilibrium, but rather 
require that any directional component (known 
increase or decrease of biomass) be included in the 
mass-balance accounting through the biomass 
accumulation (BA) term.  However, in practice, 
especially in systems with sparse data such as the 
subarctic gyres, the necessary averaging of data 
over longer (climatic regime-scale) time periods 
requires an added assumption of relative stability. 
 
Within a modeled regime, it is assumed that the 
ecosystem lies close (within the range of short-
term process noise) to an attractive and relatively 
stable equilibrium for all modeled biomass 
components.  The system is not assumed to exist 
in this state in any given instant;  rather, like a 
carrying capacity for an individual species, it is the 
state towards which the ecosystem would tend in 
the absence of driving perturbations (changes in 
fishing rates, climate, or other process-related 
noise).

ECOPATH model building and balancing 
 
The construction of an ECOPATH model for each 
of the two regions shown in Figure 1 was an 
iterative process of data gathering and 
examination.  Data were collected and/or 
contributed by Task Team members and workshop 
participants, and graded by quality as fully 
documented in Appendix A.   
 
During this initial data gathering and preparation, 
no attempt was made to adjust or balance the input 
parameters based on mass-balance concerns.  The 
results of this initial phase was an unbalanced 
model;  that is, a quantitative food web for which 
many of the functional groups’ EEs were far 
greater than 1.0, indicating potential errors in the 
input data or incorrect/incomplete model 
formulation.  These unbalanced models were 
presented at the initial three-day workshop in 
Honolulu, U.S.A. (Appendix D) and, based on 
discussion of data quality and sources, adjustments 
were made to balance the model (reduce all EEs 
below 1.0) as discussed in Appendix A.  
 
After conducting this initial balancing exercise, 
varied metrics of ecosystem structure, such as 
community respiration, production, trophic level, 
and niche habitat were calculated from the 
balanced models of the two ecosystems.  Further, 
initial ECOSIM runs (perturbation analyses) were 
performed as described below.  The results of 
these runs with the initial balanced models often 
highlighted connections in the model which were 
felt by workshop participants to be inaccurate, 
represent model pathologies, or not accord with 
limited historical data and/or experience.  After 
this workshop, additional data sources were 
targeted and provided which helped to clarify 
many of these data gaps (see Appendix A).   
 
Thus, several generations of balanced models were 
produced and subjected to the similar tests before 
the final workshop in La Paz, Mexico (Appendix 
F).  The two models presented here, one for each 
of the Eastern and Western Gyres, represent the 
final iteration of these models.  In several cases 
documented in Appendix A, data did not exist to 
clarify perceived model errors and thus 
recommendations for future data collection are 
provided. 
 
The comparative ecosystem metrics of energy 
flow and niche habitat reported in the “Results and 
Discussion” section are from these two final 
models.  Most of the calculation methods for these 
metrics are documented in the ECOPATH 
literature, specifically in the User’s Manual 
(Christensen et al. 2000);  cases where our 
calculations differed are indicated in the section.   
 
Dynamic simulations using ECOSIM 
 
This assumption of relative stability becomes a 
formal constraint in the extension of the 
ECOPATH model to dynamic predictions through 
the use of ECOSIM.  ECOSIM uses the mass-
balance solution to the ECOPATH master 
equations to calibrate the following biomass 
dynamics model:

More specific information on each of the above 
functions, and their calculation from ECOPATH 
parameters, is given in Table 3.   
 
This general model as written does not 
automatically assume that an equilibrium state 
exists for all functional groups in the ecosystem.  
In particular, the predator/prey interaction 
functions f(B) are set from consumption, 
production, and diet parameters plus an additional 
term, vulnerability, which represents the relative 
strength of top-down (Lotka-Volterra) interactions 
and bottom-up (density-dependent ratio) 
interactions.  Further, the relative importance of 
foraging time limitation or handling time may be 
included as tunable parameters.  In theory the use 
of these functions does not guarantee that the 
system has an equilibrium state, and the above 
formulae may include oscillatory or chaotic 
dynamics. 
 
However, as coded and used in practice as a 
transition between ECOPATH and ECOSIM, the 
parameter M
0
 (“other” mortality) for each  
functional group is set after all of the other 
parameters in the rate equation have been 
calculated.  It is set from EE values so that, in the

absence of a non-zero biomass accumulation 
(BA), the ECOPATH system of mass-balance 
equations also represents the equilibrium state of 
the dynamic equations for all functional groups.  
The fact that other parameters were adjusted in the 
ECOPATH stage to ensure that all EEs<1.0 
guarantees that a stable equilibrium exists in the 
model, although this equilibrium may approach an 
oscillatory or chaotic state if vulnerability is set for 
strong top-down (Lotka-Volterra) interactions.   
 
The practice also guarantees that only a single 
equilibrium state exists:  it is not possible for 
“state flips” or multiple equilibria to exist as 
emergent properties of changes in state space.  
Regime shifts are thus only modellable as input 
(hypothesized) changes in external forcing 
parameters that persist throughout the regime, and 
not as internal ecosystem re-organizations.  While 
diet switching occurs in a modelled predator as 
differing prey species change in biomass, 
“preferences” remain constant and thus overall 
transitions remain smooth and reversible. 
 
Thus the EE term performs a “double duty” in the 
EwE approach as it represents model uncertainty 
in ECOPATH, yet is used as a dynamic 
equilibrium-creating term in ECOSIM.  The 
relative stability of this equilibrium is determined 
by all of the parameters in the system, but in 
particular, by adjusting the vulnerability parameter 
for each predator prey link.  Additionally, a “low 
but positive” threshold is assumed for each 
biomass that ensures that no biomass may 
permanently be removed from the ecosystem. 
 
The resulting set of differential equations is run 
forward in time using standard numerical 
integration routines (Runge-Kutta order 4 or 
Adams-Basforth) which allow for the input of time 
varying forcing functions in fishing mortality rates 
(F’s) or primary production rate (PP’s).  Other 
 
 
 
 
possible forcing functions, such as time-varying 
growth efficiencies (GE’s) as an interaction 
between temperature and biology, were not 
explored in these experiments.  
 
Discussion of the uncertainty, and in particular the 
overstability of ECOSIM under the above default 
assumptions, is discussed elsewhere (Aydin and 
Friday 2001).  In practice, it is quite possible to 
tune ECOSIM with historical data to remove 
overstability from the model.  By allowing the 
model to “spin-up” from a hypothetical stable state 
to a far-from-equilibrium state, large-scale 
changes and the effect of permanent decline of 
component functional groups may be considered.  
However, the limited historical data available in 
the subarctic gyres proved to be insufficient to 
fully calibrate these particular simulations. 
 
Given the limitations of historical data available 
for the gyres, the ECOSIM results presented here 
should be considered first-order perturbation 
analyses.  These are perturbations of ecosystems 
as they exist within a regime, and do not represent 
regime shifts except in cases where the mechanism 
of regime shift (such as increased primary 
production) is hypothesized separately and input to 
(rather than derived from) the model.  Even given 
this limitation, it is possible to test effects, for 
example, of assuming that a regime shift is the 
result of an increase in primary production input 
into the model.  Again, while it is possible to tune 
a version of the ECOSIM equations to model 
regime scale “switches” in habitat or predator/prey 
interactions, in the case of the gyres the data was 
insufficient to pursue this route. 
 
Perturbation-style projections 
 
While the lack of historical data for the gyres 
prevents the calibration of ECOSIM equations to 
create truly “predictive” models, the results may 
be used as a general first-order perturbation 
analyses.  That is, large external forcing events 
may be applied to the ECOSIM equations to 
determine what species and/or functional groups 
will tend to respond the most to particular types of 
ecosystem changes.  The interest here is primarily 
in the comparative approach between systems. 
 
Two basic types of perturbation analyses were 
carried out.  The first was to change primary 
production rates by increasing and/or decreasing 
the constant parameters of the PP function.  The 
second was to remove specific functional groups 
by drastically increasing fishing (F).  For each of 
these perturbations, the change was made at the 
beginning of the simulation and remained in place 
for 50 simulated years.  The biomass differences at 
the end of the 50 years are reported. 
 
In order to estimate errors that might arise from 
assuming a single equilibrium state, simulations 
were repeated for 10,000 Monte Carlo estimates of 
equilibrium states.  Each separate state was 
determined by drawing a subset of the ECOPATH 
parameters (B, P/B, Q/B, and DC vectors) from 
distributions based on their error ranges listed in 
Appendix A, and re-balancing each model to 
determine EE values.  These multiple states are 
reported as 95% confidence intervals for each base 
simulation. 
 
This type of error analysis does not account for 
systematic bias;  specifically, the error that might 
occur from assuming an incorrect functional 
response, or incorrectly accounting for relative 
degrees of top-down and bottom-up forcing (the 
“vulnerability” and passive respiration parameters 
indicated above).  With extremely limited data for 
historical fitting, we were unable to accurately 
tune the models to account for these biases.  For 
some simulations, the effects of assuming 
increased or decreased vulnerabilities are reported.  
However, without the ability to accurately tune 
these models, the results presented here should be 
considered to provide simple directional (up or 
down) relationships between components of the 
ecosystem and should not be used as quantitative 
predictions.   
 
Regime-fitting style projections 
 
As described in Appendix A, outputs from 
NEMURO, a detailed nutrient-phytoplankton-
zooplankton (NPZ) model calibrated with Eastern 
Gyre (Station P) zooplankton data, were used to 
calibrate seasonal dynamics in ECOSIM lower 
trophic level functional groups.  This allowed  
 
 
 
 
ECOSIM to be run in two modes:  with and 
without seasonal forcing;  the latter assumes that 
seasonal processes are time-smoothed to an annual 
average. 
 
EwE includes simple non-linear data fitting 
routines that allow forcing functions to be input 
and shaped so as to minimize error between 
ECOSIM time trends and input historical data:  
this method may be used to tune the model or 
explore hypotheses on climate forcing as they 
explain historical data.  
 
After the literature review and workshops detailed 
in Appendices C-F, a limited number of biological 
time series were available for the purposes of such 
fitting.  While some data existed from high seas 
cruises over several years (Appendix A), these 
data were limited in coverage and noisy, and 
generally were collected over time periods too 
short to allow for fitting. 
 
Adult abundance data for Pacific salmon 
(Oncorhynchus spp.) were available for longer 
periods (40 years or more), but these data were 
specific to freshwater stock or country rather than 
ocean feeding areas (coastal areas and gyres).  
However, tagging information (e.g. Myers et al. 
1996) provides qualitative descriptions of stock 
distribution within the gyres. 
 
It was felt, on balance, that using these data to 
construct some “back-of-the-envelope” time trends 
for salmon in the gyres, as described in Appendix 
A, could be a useful starting point for comparing 
salmon trends to possible trends in lower trophic-
level production in the gyres.  These estimates do 
assume some degree of mixing of Asian and North 
American stocks in both gyres, and unlike 
maturing adult net-sampling programs, take into 
account the presence of immature feeding fish.  
However, it should be emphasized that, while the 
results presented below provide a starting point for 
examining the relationship between gyre 
production and salmon, extensions of data through 
new time series, and modeling techniques through 
explicit gyre/shelf linkage considerations, are 
strongly encouraged for future pursuit. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Food web structure 
 
Energy flow 
 
The results discussed in this section are based on 
the “final” 1990s food webs of the Western 
Subarctic Pacific (WSA) and the Eastern Subarctic 
Pacific (ESA) ECOPATH models.  The data used 
to construct the final models, adjustments made to 
create mass-balance, all final input parameters, 
and the assessed data quality of input parameters, 
may be found in Appendices A and B.  
 
For comparative purposes, individual functional 
groups (“boxes”) were chosen to be as similar as 
possible between the WSA and ESA models.  In 
the end, 55 functional groups were chosen to 
reflect the similarities in species composition 
between the two systems, with differences being 
assumed to occur in biomass and diet 
compositions of the common functional groups 
(Fig. 3).  Species occurring on one side of the 
Pacific were assumed to have a biomass of zero on 
the other side.  In some broad functional groups, 
such as mesopelagic fish or micronektonic squid,  
 
 
 
Fig. 3 Food webs of the Western and Eastern Subarctic Pacific Gyres (WSA and ESA) combined to 
show differences in biomass (boxes) and flow rates (lines between boxes).  Red indicates higher 
biomasses or rates in the WSA;  blue indicates higher biomasses or rates in the ESA.  Box areas and flow 
widths are proportional to log (biomass or flow rate).

biomass 
(per unit 
area) 
 
 
 
 
the species making up the groups may differ 
between the two sides.  Due to data limitations and 
assumed low variation in comparison to biomass, 
it was assumed that functional groups’ life-history 
and bioenergetics parameters (P/B and Q/B) were 
identical between the two systems. 
 
The WSA was estimated to possess a higher 
biomass across the board for lower trophic level 
species (phytoplankton and zooplankton).  In 
trophic levels 3+, the biomass of sardine, anchovy, 
chaetognath, pink salmon, minke whale, clubhook 
squid, common dolphin, tufted puffin and 
albatross were higher in the WSA.  The ESA has 
higher biomass levels of large jellyfish, saury, 
Pacific pomfret and flying squid, and all species of 
salmon except pink. 
 
The high estimated biomass of flying squid in the 
east versus pink salmon in the west highlights an 
issue with data collection in the two gyres:  much 
of the data in the east is from more southerly 
regions.  It is unclear if the difference between 
salmon and flying squid is due to an east/west 
difference or a north/south difference.  The effects 
of east/west versus north/south may also be real 
since the influence of the Subarctic Current is 
more limited in the west than in the east (Fig. 2). 
 
The WSA has a higher biomass (per unit area) for 
all trophic levels, and this difference increases 
with increasing trophic level.  Trophic level 1 
biomass is approximately 5% higher in the WSA 
while trophic level 5 biomass is 25% higher in the 
WSA (Table 4; trophic levels denoted by Roman 
numerals are “transformed” trophic levels as per 
Ulanowitz 1983). 
 
The lower trophic levels (1 and 2) have 
throughputs that are extremely high in comparison 
to other ECOPATH models, for example the 
Eastern Bering Sea (Aydin et al. 2002).  This is 
probably due to the inclusion of an explicit 
bacterial group as an intermediate detrital recycler 
(on trophic level 2).  This also has the effect of 
lengthening the assumed pathways between lower 
and upper trophic levels.  Further, the assumed 
high efficiency of bacterial metabolism leads to 
the high transfer efficiencies measured on trophic 
level 2 (Table 4).  In general, detrital turnover 
times and bacterial recycling are some of the least 
understood processes in these or other models;  for 
example, the NEMURO NPZ model reported 
different seasonal results depending on whether a 
bacterial loop was explicitly present.  Instead of 
explicitly including the bacteria as was done in the 
ESA and WSA models, it is probably sufficient to 
assume that bacterial processes occur within the 
detritus functional groups and that cycling rates 
and turnover times can be controlled within the 
models by varying the size of the detrital pool.

To show how the production in each trophic level 
is distributed among broad categories of species, 
functional groups in the original models were 
summed into 17 larger groups shown in Figure 4. 
 
These groups show the surprising importance of 
large zooplankton (greater than copepods in body 
size) in middle trophic levels (4-6), relative to 
forage fish.  The zooplankton are on a high trophic 
level as chains such as detritus -> bacteria -> 
copepods -> amphipods -> chaetognaths are 
possible.  On trophic levels 7-8, large squid are the 
most productive species in both systems;  in the 
WSA zooplanktivorous salmon (pink, sockeye and 
chum) are additionally important.  Sharks 
dominate production at the top trophic level in 
both systems. 
 
Connections 
 
In the WSA, a total of 404 predator/prey links 
were included for the 51 functional groups in the 
model, while in the ESA model, a total of 363 
predator/prey links were included for 48 functional 
groups.  Since the number of links in a random 
web might be expected to increase with the square 
of the number of groups, these values indicate a 
similar level of connectivity modeled in the two 
food webs.

To investigate differences in connections in detail, 
a similarity matrix was constructed for each model 
by computing a measure of dietary (niche) overlap 
between each pair of functional groups 
(Christensen et al. 2000).  This matrix was 
transformed into a cladogram of diet relatedness 
for the ESA and WSA (Figs. 5-6).  The branching 
of the tree shows relatedness of successively more 
similar functional groups in terms of diets.  A 
cutoff similarity of 0.70 (on a scale of 0 to 1) was 
chosen as it tends to divide functional groups into 
larger collections with several major diet items in 
common. 
 
As seen in Figures 5-6, functional grouping with a 
similarity of 0.70 reveals 17 distinct feeding types 
in the ESA and 18 in the WSA:  four of these are 
phytoplankton and detritus in each model.  These 
groups, sorted by trophic level, show a progression 
from large squid eaters to micronektonic squid 
eaters, forage fish eaters, and zooplanktivores in 
both systems. 
 
Some key differences in dietary niches between 
the ESA and WSA include sharks, which in the 
ESA are modeled as feeding primarily on squid, 
while in the west are modeled as feeding on fish, 
especially pink salmon.  In the west, sockeye 
salmon are shown on a higher trophic level than 
pink salmon due to consumption of micronektonic 
squid;  the two have closely related zooplankton 
diets in the east (Figs. 5-6).  In both systems, chum 
salmon specialize on gelatinous zooplankton and 
are the only species for which such food 
consumption was measured. 
 
In both systems, baleen whales consume primarily 
zooplankton rather than forage fish, causing them 
to be closer in diets to forage fish than to larger 
fish.  This suggests their role with respect to 
forage fish may be more as competitor than 
predator in the open subarctic gyres.  The lower 
trophic level dietary matrices were taken from the 
NEMURO model linkages in both models and are 
thus identical. 
Carrying capacity 
 
The issue of “control” in the upper trophic levels, 
especially with regard to the carrying capacity of 
salmon and other large nekton, cannot be fully 
addressed with a static model.  However, a few 
conclusions on general energy availability may be 
drawn from these food webs.  (Carrying capacity 
as applied to salmon refers to the energy available 
for somatic growth, as the abundance of salmon is 
thought to be determined by coastal processes not 
included in these models). 
 
As seen in Figure 4, the more complex 
assumptions about lower trophic levels (including 
microzooplankton and bacterial groups) 
effectively raises the trophic level of large 
(predatory) zooplankton so they function as prey 
and competitors for zooplanktivorous species such 
as salmon.  A great deal of the variation in their 
role is expected to be seasonal. 
 
NEMURO (as filtered through ECOPATH) 
predicts that, when totaled throughout the seasonal 
cycle of a year, 67% of large phytoplankton and 
77% of small phytoplankton is consumed by 
zooplankton, the remainder being unaccounted for 
or flowing to detritus in the ESA.  Of this flow to 
detritus, 42% must be recycled to fuel the 
estimated bacterial production (from the EE values 
in Table B6).  As NEMURO results for the WSA 
were not available at the time of model 
construction, these calculations were not 
performed for the Western Gyre except to note 
that an overall greater level of primary production 
is required to fuel the WSA system.  Since 
seasonal variation is greater in the WSA  (Harrison 
et al. 1999; Appendix A), it is possible that a 
greater percentage of energy from phytoplankton 
blooms is not directly consumed by zooplankton 
in the WSA, but rather, lost or filtered through 
bacterial processes.

If multiple zooplankton species are pooled and the 
destination of energy consumed by zooplankton is 
tracked, the difficulty of using bottom-up 
estimations of energy flow to project increases in 
nekton carrying capacity becomes evident (Table 
5).  Of the energy, 78% is used in respiration and 
14-15% used in “internal” consumption between 
zooplankton species.  Consumption by gelatinous 
species (large jellyfish and salps) accounts for 4-
5% of the energy flow, while consumption by all 
other species amounts to less than 0.5% combined. 
 
Accordingly, small amounts of process noise in 
zooplankton respiration rates may result in large 
changes in the estimates of forage available for 
large species.  Since 80-90% of zooplankton 
consumption is lost to internal processes, a small 
change in respiration rates (e.g., through climate-
driven changes in water temperature) or efficiency 
of foraging opportunities (e.g., through changes in 
seasonal timing) could lead to a substantial change 
in estimates of energy available throughout the 
food web. 
 
However, the dominance of respirative processes 
in zooplankton does not remove the possibility of 
top-down control, or competition of large nekton 
through zooplankton species.  While consumption 
represents only 5-6% of the total energy leaving 
the zooplankton (Table 5), this flow tends to be 
from the “top” of the zooplankton food web;  that 
is from species such as euphausiids rather than 
microzooplankton.  A small change in mortality on 
euphausiids, for example, may affect the “internal” 
consumption rates by 1-2% which would 
effectively double or halve the forage available for 
all fish species.  When mortality processes are 
isolated, gelatinous species (large jellyfish and 
salps) are seen to have the largest potential for 
impacting zooplankton.  
 
Overall, the possible variation in energy flow 
between large and small zooplankton, based on 
changes in seasonality or other aspects of climate, 
limits our ability to predict changes in gyre 
carrying capacity through energetic calculations of 
lower trophic levels alone.  However, this 
limitation does not remove the possibility of top-
down control being a factor for zooplankton in the 
gyres. 
 
Perturbation-style ECOSIM projections 
 
Initial exploratory analysis 
 
The ECOSIM interface built into EwE allows for a 
quick deterministic projection of multispecies 
interactions resulting from basic manipulations in 
ecosystems;  for example, the software allows 
users to investigate the effects of removing or 
reducing a species or functional group through 
fishing.  This graphical simulation tool was used 
in the workshop setting in an exploratory manner 
(Appendix F).  During the workshop, several 
perturbation scenarios were explored and the 
initial results were discussed;  in some cases, this

initial work revealed potential weaknesses in the 
current models or data, and resulting adjustments 
are noted in Appendix A.  However, it was not 
immediately clear in the workshop how 
uncertainty in either model structure or input 
parameters would affect the results in a general 
sense.  A subset of these scenarios was selected for 
further examination, specifically through 
sensitivity analysis. 
 
As reviewed by Givens (1994), “simple” 
sensitivity analyses in deterministic models may 
involve setting critical input parameters too high 
or low, and investigating which inputs within these 
ranges created a large change in projected outputs.  
This approach was not used for several reasons.  
First of all, testing combinations of high and low 
values for a reasonable subset of input parameters 
would require excessive computer time.  
Moreover, even without requiring an equilibrium 
assumption, such testing of input parameters 
would throw away much of the constraining 
covariance in input parameters that were 
appropriate to include to continue to satisfy the 
overall thermodynamic bounds of the ecosystems.  
At the same time, it was desired to allow 
exploration of initial non-equilibrium states in a 
manner not permitted by the exploratory 
sensitivity analyses such as EcoRanger included in 
the EwE package.   
 
To incorporate both the information in the input 
data (initial model state and parameters) and 
model information gained by thermodynamic 
bounding, the following procedure was used.  This 
procedure is a simplified form of the Bayesian 
Synthesis approach (Givens et al. 1993), where the 
simplification arises since there is no informative 
prior information on model outputs, only inputs, 
and the only added information comes from model 
structure rather than from fitting to new (time 
series) data.  Several iterations and variations of 
this procedure were performed, and the selected 
method was chosen to minimize problems such as 
“Borel’s Paradox” associated with mapping and 
updating probability distributions with 
deterministic models (Givens 1994), although 
aspects of the problem may still exist.  The final 
procedure used is outlined as follows:   
 
1. For each of the ESA and WSA, 20,000 
simulated ecosystems were created using a 
Monte Carlo process [see Box A].  Each 
ecosystem consisted of a set of parameters for 
the ECOSIM dynamic equations and a vector 
of initial biomass values and was not 
necessarily in initial equilibrium.  Ranges of 
parameters were based on confidence ranges 
of ECOPATH inputs in Appendix A.  The 
parameters chosen for drawing were picked 
based on which parameters might be expected 
to be relatively independent within a single 
functional group. 
 
2. Each generated ecosystem was tested for 
relative thermodynamic consistency, to 
discard perceived “impossible” states and to 
impose the likely existence of an equilibrium 
state containing positive biomass for all 
functional groups without explicitly specifying 
the equilibrium as in EwE [see Box A(3)].  
This constraint eliminated over 90% of 
generated ecosystems, leaving 1,315 
ecosystems for the ESA and 1,514 ecosystems 
for the WSA, which were deemed sufficient 
numbers for later steps. 
 
3. Each of the resulting models was run for 30 
years (time step of one year) with no 
perturbations to give a “baseline” value and 
confidence limits for year-30 biomass of each 
functional group.  These runs (and those 
below) were automated with ECOSIM 
algorithms in a routine called EcoSense, 
implemented in Visual Basic by K. Aydin 
(code available upon request).  To ensure 
accuracy, the EcoSense results were compared 
to EwE results, and EcoSense code was 
compared to relevant sections of EwE code 
provided by Villy Christensen.  
 
4. Each perturbation was run for 30 years in the 
exploratory mode for the two base models (in 
EwE and EcoSense) to determine baseline 
(ECOSIM predicted) change.  The final year-
30 biomass of each functional group is 
reported. 
 
5. Each perturbation was run for 30 years in each 
generated, non-discarded ecosystem.  The 
results reported are the difference, for each 
 
 
 
 
generated ecosystem, between the non-
perturbed ecosystem year-30 biomass and the 
perturbed ecosystem year-30 biomass.  The 
median and confidence levels for these  
differences are reported.  
 
Four parameter types – vulnerability (Walters et 
al. 1997), foraging time adjust rate (Christensen et 
al. 2000), handling time (Christensen et al. 2000), 
and passive respiration percentage (Aydin and 
Friday 2001) – additionally govern each 
predator/prey functional response.  For these 
parameter types, no methodology exists for setting 
perceived or reasonable error ranges.  For all of 
these parameters except handling time, step (5) 
above was re-run using combinations of “high” 
and “low” global defaults based on ranges used or 
published in other ECOSIM models.  This is 
meant as a measure of global bias resulting from 
changing the EwE defaults for these parameters.  
Handling time was removed as a factor as the 
parameter requires an iterative summing of prey 
which dramatically increases computer time:  the 
default ECOSIM assumption is that handling time 
is unimportant in comparison with vulnerability. 
 
It is important to note that, while this procedure 
escapes the equilibrium assumptions of the EwE 
approach, the method still assumes that the 
ECOPATH equilibrium state is the center of each 
distribution.  The only way to move away from 
equilibrium as a null-hypothesis is to obtain 
historical (time trend) data for species biomass 
levels.  For determining “unmeasurable” 
parameters such as vulnerability, these data are 
critical (Christensen et al. 2000; Aydin and Friday 
2001).  Fitting to time trend data is the approach 
favored by EwE and EcoSense fitting routines, and 
the single greatest lack in the ESA and WSA data 
lies in the lack of time trend data for tuning bias in 
species projections. 
 
Finally, these results take into account error in 
parameterization of food web effects only.  
Recruitment process error, perhaps the most 
studied and greatest in magnitude type of error in 
fisheries biology, is not considered and may 
outweigh the multi-species considerations covered 
here.  
 
Perturbation results 
 
Uncertainty in the ECOPATH base equilibrium 
 
Figure 7 shows the median and 95% distribution 
limits for the percentage difference, for each 
functional group between the ECOPATH 
equilibrium biomass and year-30 biomass for the 
generated ecosystems (with no external 
perturbations).  The 95% distribution is shown, in 
this and all subsequent simulations, for the case in 
which vulnerability equals 0.30 for all functional 
groups, passive respiration (as a percentage of 
total respiration) equals 0%, and foraging time 
adjustment is turned off (adjust rate equals 0). 
 
Examination of all high and low combinations for 
these three parameters (applied to all functional 
groups simultaneously) indicated that foraging 
time adjustment was important for the transient 
behavior of the model but less so for the long-term 
(year-30) “equilibrium” level for biomass.  Other 
combinations showed that pairwise, interactions 
between passive respiration and vulnerability were 
more or less additive.  Therefore four distinct 
cases are illustrated in Figure 7 and subsequent 
figures:  the base case (dashes and error bars);  the 
base case with high global vulnerability equals 0.5 
(triangles);  the base case with low global 
vulnerability equals 0.1 (circles);  and the base 
case with passive respiration equals 20% total 
respiration (open diamonds). 
 
The results in Figure 7 show that trophic 
uncertainty is generally largest in the middle of the 
food web.  Thermodynamics constrains the highly 
aggregated lower trophic levels of both food webs 
(phytoplankton through copepods) due to 
aggregation of those groups and the requirements 
that the groups provide sufficient forage.  As 
predation mortality is the greatest source of 
uncertainty in these models, uncertainty in top 
trophic levels is also limited.  Salmon and squid 
tend to have the highest uncertainty with the 95% 
confidence intervals in both models ranging 
between –90% and +800%. 
 
The increased top-down control indicated by high 
vulnerability scenarios increases projected 
 
 
 
 
Box A 
 
1. Each of the ECOPATH input parameters for each functional group (B, P/B, Q/B, and DC) was given 
an index of error between +/-10% (low uncertainty) and +/-90% (high uncertainty).  This data grading 
procedure was the result of workshop discussions (Appendix A). 
2. 20,000 modeled dynamic ecosystems for each of the ESA and the WSA were created using the master 
ECOSIM equations as re-written in the “Methods” section and drawing from distributions to select 
the following parameters for the equations.  For each predator: 
 
a. PB(start) was selected from a Uniform distribution in the P/B error range; 
b. GE was selected from a Uniform distribution in the Q/B error range; 
c. Each element of the predator’s diet composition was selected from a Uniform distribution in the 
DC error range and re-normalized (giving each diet component a normal distribution); 
d. Since the above three parameters are multiplied to determine the starting M2 for the predator’s 
prey, the M2 component had a resulting log-normal distribution deemed appropriate for variable 
consumption/feeding data; 
e. M0 was chosen from a uniform distribution around its original ECOPATH value using the P/B 
error range.  Since ECOPATH sets M0 from EE to “balance” the dynamic equations, at the mean 
value for all input parameters, the system is in the original ECOPATH equilibrium;  however by 
selecting M0 independently the system begins away from equilibrium; 
f. The initial biomass of each functional group was chosen from a Uniform distribution with the B 
error range.  Initial fishing rate F was not changed for any species; 
g. Parameters for the predator/prey functional response for which no methodology existed 
(vulnerability, passive respiration rate, foraging time) were set to vul=0.30;  foraging adjust rate 
=0 (no foraging adjust);  passive respiration rate=0;  handling time=1000 (handling time 
unimportant. 
 
3. Each model was run for 30 years and the distribution of year-30 biomass values was examined 
relative to starting ECOPATH values.  The models began out of equilibrium and 30 years was 
generally sufficient for models to approach within 10% of each model’s unique equilibrium state.  
Investigation of these distributions indicated that most functional groups had a bi-modal distribution 
of year-30 biomass, with one mode centered around the original (ECOPATH) equilibrium biomass 
levels and a second, larger mode at zero.  In other words, in most generated ecosystems a subset of 
functional groups “died out” of the ecosystem over 30 years.   
 
Closer examination revealed that most of these extinctions resulted from the dying out of complete 
trophic levels.   In other words, the lack, in most models, of an equilibrium state in which all functional 
groups had a positive biomass was not due to competitive exclusion.  Rather, it was due to drawing sets of 
parameters that were thermodynamically inconsistent, in that they represented evolutionarily unrealistic 
over-consumption of entire sections of the food web. 
 
Therefore, all generated models were rejected if, after running the base case for 30 years, at least one 
functional had decreased to 1/1000 of its ECOPATH biomass, or increased to 1000 times its ECOPATH 
biomass.  These criteria rejected over 90% of generated ecosystems from consideration and eliminated the 
lower (zero) peak from all output distributions.  Rejecting such inconsistent models was seen to represent 
the adding of thermodynamic information into output distributions and allowed the exploration of non-
equilibrium initial states while guaranteeing that the model allowed the broad functional groups that 
existed in the ECOPATH model to persist over time.

biomass levels for sharks and salmon in both 
models, while decreasing projected levels for large 
zooplankton species.  The effect of passive 
respiration is to provide a bioenergetics “damper” 
on biomass growth, and this is seen as a positive 
effect in homeothermic birds and mammals for 
which respiration rates are much greater. 
 
For the remainder of the simulations, the change 
reported is the difference between each base case 
(summarized in Figure 7 distributions) and each 
manipulated case, summarized as a distribution of 
change direction and magnitude.  In other words, 
if (in a particular generated ecosystem run 
generated for Figure 7) a year-30 biomass goes up 
to 200% of the ECOPATH equilibrium, but in the 
 
 
 
 
manipulated case the year-30 biomass only goes 
up to 150% of year-30 biomass, the reported 
change is negative (150-200)/200x100% = 
negative 25%).  The results reported are thus the 
distributions of direction and magnitude of 
manipulated change given the trajectory of each 
“unmanipulated” ecosystem.  This must be placed 
against the background of uncertainty in Figure 7 
to determine the overall uncertainty of year-30 
biomass levels due to trophic interactions. 
 
Manipulation I:  Bottom-up pulse 
 
To simulate the effects of a global increase in 
primary production, the primary production rate 
constant (in the PP half-saturation curve) was 
increased by 20% for both small and large 
phytoplankton.  This increase was applied in three 
ways for each ecosystem:  to small phytoplankton 
only, to large phytoplankton only, and to both 
small and large phytoplankton.  As the results 
differed in magnitude but not direction, only the 
results for raising both groups simultaneously are 
reported.  As discussed in Appendix A, the 
biomass and production levels in the ECOPATH 
models represent the annual averages, and thus 
this increase should be taken as an “overall 
increase” or interannual anomaly applied 
throughout the year without regard to seasonal 
timing or differential occupancy rates.  
 
In both the ESA model (Fig. 8) and the WSA 
model (Fig. 9), the ECOSIM base case (gray bars 
in both figures) shows a general 20% increase in 
year-30 biomass as a result of the 20% increase in 
long-term primary production.  The exception is 
the birds for which the respirative cost of 
increasing biomass is relatively high.  However, if 
that respiration is made partly passive (20% 
passive, open diamonds in both figures), all birds 
and mammals then show a consistent 20% 
increase along with the fish.  The passive 
metabolic cost acts as a stabilizer to allow biomass 
to accumulate.  Since the “background” metabolic 
costs of homeothermy are high, it is likely that 
birds and mammals have a higher passive 
metabolism than fish. 
Clubhook squid show an extremely large amount 
of variation around the base increase;  it is not  
certain what drives this difference.  In general, the 
fish and lower trophic levels are more variable 
than birds or mammals, and the 95% confidence 
limits for fish are greater than the relatively 
limited systematic change effected by changing 
vulnerability levels.  This larger variability is 
consistent through most scenarios and is possibly 
due to the larger number of trophic links giving 
room for larger ranges in variability. 
 
It should be noted that these confidence intervals 
as drawn do not display the covariance that exists 
between output biomass levels.  Especially in 
bottom-up scenarios, covariance between species 
of the same trophic levels would generally prevent 
all of those species from increasing 
simultaneously.  Disaggregation may be another 
source of the variability in the mid-trophic levels: 
more functional groups within a trophic level 
gives rise to more variation in pathways between 
generated ecosystems, so that it is more likely that 
only select subsets of species will benefit in each 
given ecosystem. 
 
Manipulation II:  Removal of squid 
 
Neon flying squid.  There is considerable 
confidence in the salmon diet composition for both 
gyres and discernible differences in relative 
proportion of micronektonic squid, forage fish and 
mesopelagic fish between the two gyre models.  
Since neon flying squid and clubhook are probable 
competitors for micronektonic squid and forage 
fishes their removal may have implications for 
prey availability for salmonids.  Two experiments 
were run for each gyre:  the removal of neon 
flying squid and the removal of clubhook squid. 
 
Neon flying squid were completely removed from 
each gyre model by application of a fishing rate of 
5.0 (instantaneous mortality) over the 30-year 
simulation (Fig. 10).  In the ESA there were 
substantial increases in many functional groups, 
including several salmon species, saury, pomfret 
and competing squid species.  Sharks were as 
likely to decrease as increase (increase in the 
ECOSIM base case), reflecting whether the 
randomly drawn shark diets favored flying squid 
or flying squid competitors.  The WSA model

showed a minor increase in saury, Japanese 
anchovy and pomfret.  There was a small, decrease 
in some salmon species, which could not be 
immediately explained by direct effects.   
 
This scenario suggests that the removal of neon 
flying squid releases predation pressure on forage 
fish.  In the ESA, forage fish are a large 
component of boreal clubhook squid, coho, 
chinook and steelhead salmon diet.  The baseline 
biomass estimate of neon flying squid was an 
order of magnitude higher in the ESA than in the 
WSA model, so it is not surprising that their 
removal had more of an impact on the ESA model.  
The effects of changing vulnerability are generally 
consistent with this view.  Competing species such 
as salmon increase more with increasing 
vulnerability (triangles in Fig. 10), as increasing 
vulnerability leads to increasing top-down effects, 
this result indicates that salmon are positively 
influenced by increasing their top-down ability to 
get food when flying squid are removed. 
 
Boreal clubhook squid.  Since the removal of 
neon flying squid did not have a dramatic effect on 
the WSA model, boreal clubhook squid were 
removed separately from each gyre model by the 
same fishing method as above (Fig. 11).  In this 
case the response was negligible in the ESA.  In 
the WSA, there was a dramatic increase in the 
biomass of pomfret, sockeye, coho and chinook 
salmon.  Fulmars and storm petrels also increased 
in biomass as did large gonate squid.  The likely 
link for these increases is through released 
predation pressure on micronektonic squid by 
boreal clubhook squid.  Micronektonic squid is a 
large component of pomfret, coho and chinook 
salmon diet. 
 
The fact that increasing vulnerability to 0.5 did not 
have a positive effect on competitors as in the 
flying squid scenario (Fig. 11) suggests a different 
positioning of clubhook squid in the WSA versus 
flying squid in the ESA.  This is also seen by the 
fact that several forage species, such as pelagic 
forage fish, saury, Pacific sardine and Japanese 
anchovy decreased in the WSA with the removal 
of clubhook squid, while all forage species 
increased with the decrease of flying squid in the 
ESA. 
 
As seen in Figures 5-6, flying squid feed on a 
range of forage species while clubhook squid 
specialize on one type of forage, micronektonic 
squid.  As a result, the removal of flying squid 
allows a general increase for all of its competitors 
that feed on forage species, and this increase is 
magnified with greater top-down control.  On the 
other hand, the removal of clubhook squid releases 
micronektonic squid which then outcompete other 
forage species, so the effects on species such as 
salmon is more mixed and increasing top-down 
control does not necessarily have a positive effect. 
 
Manipulation III:  Removal of salmon 
 
Assuming that salmon abundance is determined 
outside the gyre system (e.g. Beamish and 
Mahnken 2001), changes in abundance will 
greatly affect other trophic levels if salmon are a 
driving force within the gyre system.  The results 
of removing salmon are shown in Figure 12.  
Removing all salmon from the ESA model has a 
limited impact on the biomass of other species 
groups;  forage species and salmon competitors 
such as squid and squid-eaters increase, while 
sharks decrease. 
 
In the WSA model, when salmon were removed, 
large changes in the biomass of other species 
groups occurred.  Since pink salmon are the most 
abundant fish group in the WSA model, the 
forcing is likely driven by their removal.  When 
only pink salmon were removed the large changes 
in biomass were almost identical.  The largest 
effect was for the forage fish, with their abundance 
increasing.  As a result, other species, such as 
clubhook and neon flying squid and other salmon 
that feed on forage fish, increased in biomass.  
Increasing vulnerability had a large positive effect 
on the direction of this response.  
 
The results in the ESA suggest that salmon are not 
an important group within that gyre for overall 
dynamics.  It is likely that salmon biomass relative 
to the rest of the species is too small to be an 
influence to the gyre system. The WSA results 
suggest that pink salmon are an important 
competitor controlling the system in the gyre.  One 
way of verifying these dynamics is to look for 
pomfret and neon flying squid abundance time

series for the WSA.  If these responses are 
realistic, pomfret and neon flying squid should 
have increased in abundance during the 1960s 
when pink salmon abundance was low.  In 
addition, these results suggest that the WSA is 
sensitive to salmon biomass fluctuations.  This has 
implications for the influence of coastal 
mechanisms (including hatchery salmon 
production) on gyre dynamics filtered through 
salmon biomass.  
 
As noted above, the difference of salmon impact 
between the east and the west could be attributable  
to a north/south difference in the location of the 
gyres or to areas within each gyre where data were 
available. 
 
Manipulation IV:  Removal of sharks 
 
As shown in Figure 4, sharks are the dominant 
species in the highest trophic levels and thus were 
selected for an apex predator removal experiment 
(Fig. 13). 
 
A note of caution is required for the results of 
shark removal with respect to Pacific salmon.  The 
above scenarios involved changing salmon forage 
opportunities through competitive effects.  Since 
Pacific salmon growth rates are highest during the 
gyre phase of their life cycle (Ishida et al. 1993), it 
is reasonable to suggest that the changes in their 
biomass due to changes in their available forage 
are reflective of what might occur.  Changes due 
to mortality reduction, however, are more difficult 
to interpret.  It is believed that the majority of 
salmon mortality occurs in boundary and shelf 
regions (Beamish and Mahnken 2001) and thus in 
regions uncaptured in this model.  Increases in 
salmon due to reduction in mortality, therefore, 
should be tempered with the knowledge that a far 
greater proportion of salmon mortality remains 
unaccounted for in this model. 
 
With this in mind, it is clear that the effect of 
removing sharks from the gyres is a classic trophic 
cascade.  All species preyed upon by sharks 
(salmon and squid) increase, while their own prey 
decrease.  This change is amplified with increasing 
vulnerability level (Fig. 13). 
 
Fitting to NEMURO 
 
ECOSIM allows the input of production anomalies 
by month for time periods up to 100 years.  The 
input of primary production anomalies was used to 
tune by eye the response of lower trophic levels to 
match as best as possible the patterns shown by 
initial outputs of the NEMURO model (see 
Appendix A for NEMURO references).  At the 
time of the exercise, only ESA NEMURO results 
were available so the WSA model was not so 
tuned.  The ECOSIM numerical timestep is 
generally rough on such short time-intervals (fitted 
to daily data) so the best results provided a rough 
pattern only (Fig. 14;  the NEMURO results have 
since been superceded by new versions of that 
model). 
 
While this exercise was used later to provide an 
initial seeding of a seasonal cycle for the ECOSIM 
fitting routines, it also served to examine a few 
lower trophic level assumptions within the two 
models.  First of all, it was not possible to fit 
output from NEMURO (a model without a 
microbial loop) to the ECOSIM model with 
bacterial cycling.  In order to match the two 
models, the ECOSIM bacterial group had to be 
removed and detritus exported from the system.  
This indicated that, in either model, the 
assumption of a microbial loop dramatically 
changed the results. 
 
Secondly, the only group that was not possible to 
match reasonably between ECOSIM and 
NEMURO was the predatory zooplankton, which 
had a cycle with a consistently larger amplitude in 
NEMURO than in ECOSIM (Fig. 14).  Predatory 
zooplankton are the top trophic level in NEMURO 
and thus subject to constant mortality;  this result 
indicates that upper trophic level food web effects 
may indeed feed back into the lower trophic 
levels, a fact which most NPZ-type models do not 
consider. 
 
Regime-fitting style projections 
 
Pacific salmon are one of the first ocean species 
for which long-term climate regimes have been 
linked to abundance and biomass (Beamish 1993,

Fig. 14 Best fitting of ECOSIM by eye to the NEMURO seasonal cycle of the ESA, with a monthly 
resolution.  NEMURO results have since been updated, specifically removing the large spring bloom of 
large phytoplankton which is known not to occur in the Eastern Subarctic Gyres. 
 
 
Gyres, these are the only species for which long-
term time series exist.  It has been suggested that 
the changes in the gyres were across multiple 
trophic levels and thus may be the result of food 
web effects, especially from the bottom-up 
(Brodeur and Ware 1995). 
 
Unfortunately, the only five functional groups for 
which time series existed for the gyre food web 
models were Pacific salmon.  Correlations 
between climate indices such as the Aleutian Low 
Pressure Index or Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
Index (Beamish 1993, Mantua et al. 1997) have 
been demonstrated.  Adding this relationship to the 
model would add no new information.  Moreover, 
the life cycle of the Pacific salmon, with out-of-
the-gyre fishing effects, escapement-based 
management, and hatchery supplementation is not 
particularly suited to explaining the trends of 
salmon biomass through gyre processes alone. 
 
Still, the BASS Task Team considered it 
worthwhile to examine various hypotheses for 
historical salmon biomass levels using the 
exploratory modes of ECOSIM.  Several 
hypotheses were developed:  for example, that top-
down control (shark biomass) was directly linked 
to climate and caused changes in salmon 
abundance, or that flying squid was the “source” 
of the anomaly which affected salmon through the 
food web.  Using the basic ECOSIM fitting tools, 
many of these hypotheses were quickly discarded 
as not being able to simultaneously fit trends of 
the five salmon species taken as a whole. 
 
Since salmon abundance is considered to be set 
outside the ecosystem, one other experiment made 
was to drive the model over time with set salmon 
abundance:  this exercise was performed in both 
systems and is shown for the WSA in Fig. 15 and 
the front cover.  Here, flat, stairstep lines represent 
the forced species of salmon, while jagged lines 
represent the responding species, especially 
responding to the pink salmon two-year life cycle 
(Fig. 15).  However, in terms of regimes this 
pattern was thought to be non-explanatory.

Fig. 18 Upper and lower fits vary in the densities of the splines used for fitting (low on the upper panel, 
high on the lower panel).  Upper panel shows yearly production anomaly plots with best “explanation” 
(lowest simple sum of squares error) for zooplanktivorous salmon trends while lower panel shows 
seasonal small phytoplankton standing stock anomalies with best “explanation”. 
 
Sufficient evidence existed for positive correlation 
between salmon and other species such as 
zooplankton (Brodeur and Ware 1995), so that 
salmon increasing and applying middle-out control 
was considered to be only a partial explanation:  a 
change in prey supply would also be required in 
the gyres to explain historical changes.  To this 
end, the ESA ECOSIM model was seeded with 50 
years of the default seasonal cycle (Fig. 14) as 
propagated through the food web.  This was 
compared to time series of salmon biomasses from 
1950-1998 (see Appendix A for references).  The 
initial comparison is shown in Figure 16. 
 
The ECOSIM uses a non-linear search routine 
with varying degrees of freedom to find a “lower 
trophic level” anomaly (in this case tied to small 
phytoplankton) that minimized the simple sum of 
squares error fit to the provided data.  This routine 
was run several times and the resulting fits are 
shown in Figure 17.  In general, the trends in the 
zooplanktivorous salmon are well-captured by the 
fitting routines. 
 
It is possible to fit any trend by eliminating 
sufficient degrees of freedom, and this routine is 
meant as an exploratory rather than complete 
statistical analysis.  However, in this case it is 
interesting to note the production anomalies that 
gave rise to these better fits (Fig. 18). 
 
Two types of fits were found depending on the 
order of the splines used for fitting.  The upper 
panel shows an interannual anomaly plot;  this 
provides limited information as it is equivalent to a 
correlation between salmon and a generic 
“climate” anomaly that is forced to fit a common 
pattern.  However, the pattern on the lower panel 
is distinct.  Rather than showing an interannual 
increase in production over time, it indicates a  
 
 
 
 
change in seasonal dynamics across the 1976 
regime shift (point found by fitting).  Specifically, 
while the peak (summer) biomass levels do not 
increase and even may decrease during the periods 
of high salmon abundance, it is the lessening of 
the “winter troughs” which provide the 
explanation for the change. 
 
It is important to note that, since these patterns are 
fit to a single trophic level (salmon), they do not 
represent “primary” production anomalies, but 
rather anomalies in the level of food supply 
reaching salmon.  As such, the changes shown, if 
indications of a real process, may result from the 
shifting of winter pathways between plankton and 
salmon rather than the shifting in plankton 
themselves.  Winter, while a slow growth period 
for salmon, may be a critical time for salmon 
density dependence (Aydin 2000).  It is intriguing, 
even given the exploratory nature of this analysis, 
that changes in this time of lower seasonal 
production may affect the overall growth 
opportunities for these species. 
 
As described in both the “Methods” section and 
Appendix A, these fitting results are based on 
gyres-only processes and approximations of gyre 
usage by Pacific rim salmon stocks over time: 
more detailed models of process linkages should 
be pursued. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
Overall, the results presented here of two 
quantitative food webs, one for each of the Eastern 
and Western Subarctic Pacific Gyres, should be 
seen as exploratory analyses given the available 
data.  The results, while intriguing, suggest several 
specific avenues for future work.  From a data 
perspective, for this multi-species modeling to be 
useful, it is critical that time series data on biomass 
or relative biomass trends be collected for as many 
species as possible, especially competitors and 
predators of salmon such as flying squid, pomfret 
and sharks.  While limited fisheries exist in the 
gyre regions, the interest in climate change and the 
known relationship between Pacific salmon and 
climate makes examining multi-species 
interactions an area in which research should be 
promoted. 
 
Despite the limitations outlined above, the results 
of the regime-fitting style projections provide 
some interpretation on the processes linking 
climate variation to population dynamics of 
Pacific salmon.  Using the gyre models, it appears 
that Pacific salmon abundance is primarily driven 
by processes occurring outside of the gyre system 
i.e. in coastal ecosystems.  A next step should be 
to integrate coastal, marginal seas and gyre system 
models to examine linkages (energy transfer) 
between these systems.  An integrative study 
connecting gyres to such boundary regions could 
also explore the dynamics of other migratory 
species (e.g. squid, pomfret, marine mammals and 
birds) along with the influence of shifting fronts 
and currents.  In order to examine the influence of 
these processes, seasonal data (especially during 
transition times) are required.  It is important that 
the gyre models developed here are based on 
summer data. 
 
Improvements to the gyre models require 
improved biomass estimates for a number of key 
species (Table B4), especially species common to 
both gyres  (e.g. marine mammals and birds).  For 
a number of species, diet data for the gyre regions 
were not available, and therefore, diet data from 
other regions were used.  Researchers should be 
encouraged to collect diet data from the gyre 
regions.  At a minimum, the data collected should 
include prey identified to the lowest taxonomic 
group possible, along with number and volume of 
each prey item. 
 
This study has provided a snapshot of the two sub-
arctic gyre systems and increased our 
understanding of their dynamics and how each 
system may respond to climate forcing.  This work 
should form the basis for future research in 
understanding the role of the gyre system in 
marine productivity of the North Pacific. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
APPENDIX A:  DATA GATHERING REVIEW, RESULTS AND 
BALANCING 
Outline of provided data and methods 
 
The accumulation of data sources led to several 
successive iterations of the Eastern and Western 
Subarctic (ESA and WSA) ECOPATH models.  
Initial data gathering led to the creation of 
“unbalanced” models which were adjusted for 
balance prior to and during the 2001 
BASS/MODEL Workshop in Honolulu (Appendix 
D).  During and after the meeting, additional data 
sources were made available.  Changes made to 
the model solely for the purpose of 
thermodynamic balance are described under 
“Balancing the models”, below. 
 
Further changes were made to the models due to 
the provision of new data by workshop 
participants, the discussion of studies containing 
differing range of values, or if work with ECOSIM 
projections revealed “pathological” results.  Even 
at late stages of the simulation process during and 
after the 2002 BASS/MODEL Workshop in La 
Paz (Appendix F), new data sources continued to 
be provided.  Some of these data sources became 
available after a significant number of the 
ECOSIM simulations and scenarios had been 
projected and discussed, and some of these data 
were provided in response to the results 
themselves.   
 
The approach taken for the purposes of this 
publication, was to “freeze” the models in the state 
that they existed at the beginning of the La Paz 
Workshop, as the bulk of the results in the main 
section of this report stemmed from that meeting.  
To aid in duplication and expansion of results, the 
complete list of model parameters Tables in the 
Appendix B represent these La Paz models.  
However, in this Appendix, sources of data that 
might supercede the parameters in the La Paz 
models are indicated.  Future researchers are 
encouraged to explore differences in modeled 
outcomes arising from using these differing 
values. 
 
Tables B1-B3 contain the primary literature values 
and references used for the primary parameters of 
biomass (B), production/biomass (P/B) and 
consumption/biomass (Q/B) for all functional 
groups in the WSA and ESA models.  In cases 
where a value could be taken directly from the 
literature with no changes excepting a unit, time, 
or area conversion, the original references are 
listed in these tables and not noted in the text.  The 
conversion of yearly instantaneous mortality 
estimates (Z) to P/B values are considered a unit 
conversion. 
 
Cases where additional calculations, assumptions 
or conversions were required to transform 
literature values into model parameters are 
indicated with a (*) on Tables B1-B3.  
Descriptions of the methods used for these 
parameters can be found under “Model data 
review”, below, under the section for the 
appropriate species group.  Text descriptions of 
parameters by species groups are also included if 
the majority of the data used was unpublished.  
Diet data and references are described generally in 
the text and complete diets are shown in Tables 
B7-B8. 
 
Data were graded for quality and uncertainty by 
workshop discussions of the literature search 
results.  The quality ranking of each parameter 
depended on the data source and included 
consideration of collection methodology, 
coverage, and appropriate time period.  The 
criteria for ranking were based on a “pedigree” 
methodology described for ECOPATH by 
Christensen and Pauly (1992).  Table A1 shows 
the criteria used to assign a rank to each 
parameter, and the uniform range about each point 
parameter estimate associated with each quality 
rank (as a proportion of the point estimate).  The 
overall “uncertainty” of the model is illustrated in 
Table B4 where the assessed uncertainty ranges of 
all parameters are shown.   
 
Tables B5-B8 contain parameters as they were 
entered into the WSA and ESA models, including 
diet information and detrital flow assumptions, 
formatted as ECOPATH input tables.

Balancing the models 
 
Migration 
 
While the oceanography of the subarctic Pacific 
provides some biological basis for bounding the 
Eastern and Western Subarctic Gyres, both 
ecosystems are characterized by having top trophic 
level species that are extraordinarily migratory.  
Marine mammals and birds are only present part 
of the year in the ecosystems (Springer et al. 
1999), while Pacific salmon possess a complex life 
cycle for which the gyres are an important but not 
isolated habitat. 
 
ECOPATH is generally designed to model a 
closed system;  however, several methods are 
provided for the inclusion of migration data.  
Migration rates may be added explicitly, feeding 
may be assigned to diet “import”, or biomass, 
production and consumption rates may be scaled 
for the portion of the year that each species spends 
in the gyres.   
 
All of these methods give similar results for the 
ECOPATH “balance” model;  however, all of 
these methods are known to lead to unrealistic 
projections in dynamic ECOSIM (Aydin 
unpublished).  The method selected to minimize 
errors was the last method mentioned above, that 
of scaling biomass for residence time (for marine 
 
 
 
 
mammals and birds) or biomass, production, and 
consumption (for Pacific salmon), as described 
below. 
 
Diet scaling 
 
Diet data for higher trophic levels, especially birds 
and mammals, tended to be highly aggregated and 
contained insufficient resolution to cover all 
potential prey items in the models.  For example, it 
was common for prey to be apportioned in 
literature between “fish” and “squids” without 
further taxonomic resolution.  In these cases, the 
diet of each predator that the literature apportioned 
to a major taxon, for example to “fish”, was split 
among all fish groups in the model with a 
“neutral” preference, i.e., split in proportion to the 
biomass of each fish type in the model.   
 
However, this “neutral preference” approach could 
not be used directly due to data gaps in the forage 
species biomass, specifically for “other” forage 
fish and micronektonic squid.  For these species, 
biomass estimates were unavailable and thus 
biomass was to be estimated from consumption 
requirements.  However the preference method 
noted above used biomass estimates to estimate 
consumption, thus introducing a circular 
estimation problem.   
 
This circular data gap was resolved iteratively as 
follows: micronektonic squid and fish were 
considered to be a small proportion (~10%) of 
squid and fish in diets of top predators for which 
the preference model was used.  In most cases this 
led to “unbalanced” (EE>1) predation rates on 
specific (non-forage) fish and squid groups.  When 
this occurred, the diets of predators were gradually 
shifted from specific fish and squid to the more 
general categories, and the biomass of these 
general categories increased in estimation 
accordingly. 
 
Thus, the estimated consumption of specific fish 
and squid groups in the model is close to the 
maximum possible under constraints balance, i.e., 
under constraints of production being equal to or 
greater than consumption for each individual 
group.  On the other hand, the biomass of the 
general forage species are estimated to be the 
minimum required for providing the remainder of 
dietary requirements to upper trophic levels.  The 
low grading of the diet data reflects the uncertainty 
inherent in this method. 
 
Additional adjustments 
 
The stepwise shifting of top predator diets from 
specific fish to general “forage” fish, in 
conjunction with allowing micronektonic squid 
and forage fish to be estimated based on demand, 
generally ensured that most of the species were 
thermodynamically “in balance” in the models 
(with EEs<1.0) without further drastic 
adjustments.  As mentioned in “Diet scaling” 
above, overly high EEs of fish species such as 
salmon and large squid led to shifting diets of top 
predators towards forage fish.  This repeated 
shifting was necessary mainly for sharks and 
Pacific whitesided dolphin. 
 
In addition to the general balancing, six other 
changes were made in the biomass levels of 
groups due to the specific needs of balancing the 
model.  Five of these changes were due to 
perceived mismatches in coverage;  either because 
existent data was dominated by mismatching 
border region data rather than central gyre data, or 
due to lack of seasonal data.  Balance was 
achieved in these cases by scaling biomass 
estimates as appropriate for the gyre as a whole 
over the whole year.  The sixth change was due to 
the difficulty of capturing cannibalism in a highly 
productive species.  The changes were as follows: 
 
1. Predation by toothed whales (Orca) included 
predation on mammals and birds, which 
caused EEs of some mammals and birds to be 
too high (between 2 and 3).  Feeding on birds 
and mammals is a characteristic of “transient” 
types of Orcas which are thought to be low in 
numbers and shore-based.  Toothed whale 
biomass was reduced by 80% from the initial 
(shore-based) estimate. 
 
2. The EE of Pacific sardines in the WSA model 
was initially too high (EE greater than 5).  
This was primarily due to predation by Pacific 
pomfret.  Both pomfret and sardines are 
predominantly southern species with biomass 
levels that are much higher in the Kuroshio 
Current.  In this case, the diet information 
 
 
 
 
came from southern sampling where the 
pomfret/sardine connection would be strong, 
but the biomass of sardines in the model came 
from Kamchatka Current studies and reflected 
their low presence in the northern gyre 
regions.  The biomass of Pacific sardines was 
increased from 0.017 to 0.05 t/km
2
 to account 
for the influence of the “southern” regions of 
the model.  To aid in selecting appropriate 
adjustments for sardines, several ECOSIM 
scenarios were explored which allowed for 
“invasions” of sardines in response to possible 
regime-scale shifts in abundance. 
 
3. Chaetognaths in the WSA were the source of a 
great deal of predation and led to an imbalance 
in several zooplankton groups, including 
amphipods, pteropods and euphausiids.  The 
initial chaetognath biomass estimate came 
from studies in the Kamchatka Current and 
was calculated to be 53 t/km
2
, higher then 
copepods or microzooplankton.  This biomass 
was cut approximately in half to 25 t/km
2
 
which was the maximum that allowed balance.  
This puts chaetognath biomass in a similar 
range as other large predatory zooplankton in 
the central gyre. 
 
4. WSA microzooplankton biomass as estimated 
from Kamchatka Current data was half 
copepod biomass and possessed an EE>1.  
Microzooplankton biomass was set equal to 
copepod biomass as a first approximation. 
 
5. Overall in the WSA, the EEs of amphipods, 
pteropods, and euphausiids were higher than 
1.0 even after cheatognath reduction, while the 
EE of copepods was extremely low (less than 
0.2).  This was considered to be partially due 
to seasonal sampling:  very little dietary 
sampling captured spring periods when 
copepods might dominate the diets of large 
zooplankton such as shrimp and chateognaths.  
For these highest trophic levels of 
zooplankton, predation on amphipods, 
euphausiids and pteropods was decreased, and 
predation on copepods increased.  Finally, 
10% of copepod consumption on micro-
zooplankton was shifted to phytoplankton.  As 
WSA phytoplankton was “top-down” 
balanced, the resulting phytoplankton biomass 
levels were set as sufficient to fuel the system. 
 
6. Flying squid in the ESA initially had an EE 
greater than 4, but almost all of this was due to 
cannibalism.  Cannibalism, when it occurs, 
would be best modeled by creating two 
biomass pools and having adult flying squid 
feed on juveniles, as juveniles would have a 
higher production rate and therefore be able to 
balance the demand.  Due to lack of data on 
squid recruitment dynamics, this method was 
not pursued.  Instead, 50% of the 
“cannibalism” in flying squid diets was shifted 
to micronektonic squid, which might include 
juvenile flying squid. 
 
In the initial versions of the model, two species, 
Spiny dogfish and daggertooth, were included as 
separate groups but were dropped from the models 
during the balancing process.  Spiny dogfish do 
occur in the gyres and have been caught in central 
gyre research gillnets with catch rates similar to 
those for some large squid species (Pearcy et al. 
1999).  Also, examination of dogfish stomachs 
near ocean Station P has revealed evidence of 
recent zooplankton consumption in these regions 
(Pearcy, unpublished data; Aydin, unpublished).  
However, it was felt that these animals might be 
migratory with little residence time or feeding 
effort expended in the central gyres (McFarlane 
and King, in press).  The combination of low 
production rates and assumptions of predation by 
larger animals made the species difficult to 
balance reasonably, and they were removed.  
Daggertooth (sp), even at maximum reasonable 
assumptions of density, were less than 1% of the 
biomass of any trophic level and less than 0.5% of 
any species’ predation mortality and were thus 
dropped from the model due to lack of data and 
importance of the species as a whole. 
 
Initial versions of the model had substantial 
nutrient groups as detrital pools to simulate 
nitrogen cycling in conjunction with NEMURO.  
However, the ECOSIM formulations are generally 
unsuited for fast turnover rates required for 
nutrient pool dynamics (Walters, pers. comm).  
Therefore, detrital pools were simplified into 
dissolved organic matter (NH
3
) and particulate 
 
 
 
 
organic matter (POM) which were fed on by 
bacteria, and represent the only accounting detrital 
recyclers in the final model.  A considerable 
proportion of lower trophic-level regulation in the 
gyres may be due to nutrient recycling (Harrison et 
al. 1999).  The current ECOPATH models should 
not be used to explore hypotheses based on 
specific mechanistic lower-trophic level links, for 
which a model such as NEMURO would be more 
appropriate. 
 
Model data review 
 
Physical variations 
 
Two gyres dominate Subarctic Pacific:  the 
Eastern gyre and the Western gyre. In the Eastern 
Gyre, the centre of the gyre is at approximately 
52ºN, 155ºW, and the gyre extends westward 
nearly to the dateline. Much of the research on 
lower trophic levels for the Eastern gyre was 
carried out in its southeast corner at Ocean Station 
P (50ºN, 145ºW).  The Western Gyre is northeast 
of Japan, southeast of Kamchatka Peninsula, at 
155–165º E, 45–50º N.  The gyres are bounded to 
the south by the slow, eastward flowing Subarctic 
Current at approximately 45-50ºN, formed in the 
west by the convergence of the Oyashio and 
Kuroshio Currents.  The Subarctic Current splits at 
approximately 48ºN, 130ºW, and becomes the 
northward flowing Alaska Current, and the 
southward flowing California Current. 
 
The Aleutian Low atmospheric system dominates 
the region in winter. Winds peak in winter at 12 
m/s, and decrease to 7 m/s in July.  High 
precipitation, low evaporation and freshwater land 
runoff result in an upper layer with a strong 
shallow halocline and winter mixed layer depths in 
the center of the Eastern Gyre to 75-100 m.  
Surface cooling and winter wind mixing cause 
mean surface temperature to be <6ºC in February. 
Also in February, salinity peaks at 32.7 psu, the 
mixed layer deepens to ~120 m, and nitrate and 
silicate levels increase. 
 
Severe winter storms and the dominant Aleutian 
Low result in upwelling in the gyres, which 
maintains high nutrient concentrations in surface 
waters.  Harrison et al. (1999) noted that the 
Subarctic North Pacific is one of 3 major high-
nitrate-low-chlorophyll regions. 
 
Sea surface temperatures in the Western Gyre  
(3–9.5ºC) are colder than in the Eastern Gyre  
(6–12ºC).  Nitrate, Nitrite, Silicate and Phosphate 
concentrations are higher in the Western than in 
the Eastern Gyre.  The Western Gyre has higher 
nutrient concentrations, higher chlorophyll 
concentrations than the Eastern Gyre, but similar 
summer primary productivity.  In summer the 
mixed layer depth and photic zone are shallower in 
the Western than in the Eastern Gyre.  Mean 
chlorophyll concentrations are twice as high in the 
Western than the Eastern Gyre, but depth-
integrated chlorophyll concentrations are nearly 
equal, as the photic zone is deeper in the Eastern 
than it is in the Western Gyre (Harrison et al. 
1999).  An area about 500 km in radius around 
Station P has been sampled for spatial nutrient and 
temperature variations.  Water temperatures 
increase to the east and south of Station P.  
Nutrients increase to the west and north (toward 
the centre of the Eastern Gyre).  Salinity increases 
to the north, south and west. 
 
Interannual and interdecadal changes in nutrients 
have been observed in the Eastern Gyre.  During 
the 1989 La Niña, Station P was cold, less saline 
and had nitrate-rich surface water in the winter.  
During the transition to El Niño from 1991 to 
1994, the surface waters at Station P warmed by 
2ºC, became 0.3 psu more saline, and 30% lower 
in nitrate.  A seaward extension of the nitrate-
depleted surface layer occurred in 1994, due to a 
reduction in winter nitrate concentrations.  This 
reduction was caused by an intrusion of warmer, 
lower nitrate water from the south during El Niño.  
Lower winter nitrate levels are estimated to have 
reduced new production by 40% and possibly 
shifted phytoplankton community structure.  From 
the 1970s to the 1990s, winter silicate and nitrate 
uptake has declined by 3.6 µm and 2.5 µm 
respectively, which may indicate an iron supply 
reduction in the last twenty years. 
 
Species groups 
 
Species inhabiting each gyre system were 
identified using existing reviews on the ecosystem 
dynamics of both areas (Taniguchi 1999; Mackas 
 
 
 
 
and Tsuda 1999; Brodeur et al. 1999; Beamish et 
al. 1999; Springer et al. 1999; Hunt et al. 2000). 
The species groups selected were equivalent for 
the Eastern and Western Gyre systems with five 
exceptions:  Minke whales, common dolphins, 
Japanese anchovy and Pacific sardine were in the 
Western Gyre model only, and northern elephant 
seals were in the Eastern Gyre model only.  Highly 
aggregated groups such as “micronektonic squid”,  
“other forage fish”, or “copepods” would likely 
differ in species composition between the gyres 
but are treated as functionally equivalent between 
the two models. 
 
Biomass, diet composition and production 
estimates were compiled using published 
estimates, and when possible, using data collected 
from 1990-1993, or as close to this time period as 
possible.  Estimates are annual values and are 
made from data collected in offshore areas only.  
While biomass estimates differed between gyres, 
the P/B and Q/B ratios for each species group 
were assumed to be equivalent for both gyre 
models.  This latter assumption was made due to 
data limitations, but within the Subarctic climate 
regime, P/B and Q/B values for species would be 
expected to be more similar than different.  Diet 
composition data are expressed as percentage of 
biomass. 
 
Marine mammals 
 
Cetaceans were divided into nine functional 
groups, each one containing a single species.  
Seven of these groups are present in both the 
Eastern and Western Gyres:  sperm whale 
(Physeter catodon); orca (Orcinus orca); fin whale 
(Balaenoptera physalus); sei whale (Balaenoptera 
borealis); Dall’s porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli); 
Pacific white sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus 
obliquidens) and northern right whale dolphin 
(Lissodelphis borealis).  The additional two 
groups, minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) 
and common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) were 
present in the Western Gyre only. 
 
Two pinniped groups were used in the Eastern 
Gyre model:  northern fur seal (Callorhinus 
ursinus) and northern elephant seal (Mirounga 
angustirostris).  Only one pinniped group 
(northern fur seal) was used in the Western Gyre 
model.  Although actual routes of migration are 
not well understood, Springer et al. (1999) noted 
that in general, pinnipeds remain close to shore 
throughout the year, and are not considered to be 
part of the fauna of the subarctic gyres.  Some 
other species of whales and pinnipeds have also 
been reported in the Western Gyre (Springer et al. 
1999), but have not been included in the models 
due to low numbers. 
 
Most species of cetaceans are highly migratory, 
particularly the Mysticetes which reside in higher 
latitudes in the summer for feeding, and move to 
lower latitudes in winter for breeding.  They are 
widespread and appear to be equally abundant in 
both the gyres.  Most biomass estimates reported 
were available for the North Pacific as a whole, or 
in the case of pinnipeds, based on counts at 
breeding sites, throughout the Pacific rim.  
Migration patterns have been suggested as one 
indication of differences in marine mammalian 
behaviour between regions of the Pacific.  For 
example, in the western Pacific region, Dall’s 
porpoise have a larger migration, from the Sea of 
Okhotsk in summer, to the Japan/East Sea, and 
northwestern North Pacific regions in winter.  On 
the east side of the North Pacific they have been 
observed migrating smaller distances, 
onshore/offshore only (Springer et al. 1999). 
 
The migration of species was taken into account 
by performing a broad North Pacific synthesis to 
scale North Pacific abundance and body weight 
estimates by residence time in both gyres, and 
spread across the gyres (Table A2).  P/B values for 
marine mammals were all taken from estimates of 
yearly mortality (Z) as cited in Table B1.  Q/B 
values came from daily allometric energy 
requirements listed in Hunt et al. (2000, Appendix 
9) and caloric energy densities of typical prey 
types (Table A3). 
 
Diet estimates for marine mammals were highly 
aggregated.  A review by Hunt et al. (2000) 
indicated no source of data for marine mammals 
that was specific to the ESA or WSA.  For these 
regions, the only source of data was Pauly et al. 
(1998), who reviewed general marine mammal 
diets around the world.  They divided marine 
mammal prey into 8 categories:  benthic 
invertebrates, pelagic zooplankton, small squid, 
 
 
 
 
large squid, small epipelagic fish, mesopelagic 
fish, misc. fish, and birds and mammals.  Prey 
proportions by predator are found in Hunt et al. 
(2000, Table 10.6-10.7).  As described above, 
diets in the ESA and WSA models were split to 
species within each broad category in proportion 
to the biomass of the species (Tables B7-B8).

mammals, used to provide biomass estimates for ESA and WSA models. 
 
Species Values used for estimate and literature sources 
Sperm whale 
Kato et al. (1997) give 2,300 individuals in WSA only;  Pauly and Christensen (1996) 
give 2,000 in North Pacific.  Since feeding occurs in the Bering Sea also (Aydin et al. 
2002) we assumed population was N. Pacific overall.  Used 2,000 individuals * 
18,518 kg/individual (Kato et al. 1997) * ½ year / 20 million km
2 
(total N. Pacific 
area);  this is most likely a minimal estimate. 
Toothed whales 
The only available estimates of ESA orca biomass were from Pauly and Christensen 
(1996) and covered the “transient” type of orca (mammal-consumer) only.  These 
species were left in the model and reduced for balance, although it is not known if this 
life-history type feeds in the subarctic gyres. 
Fin whale 
20,000 individuals * 55,590 kg/individual (Evans 1987; Gambell 1985a) * ½ year / 20 
million km
2 
(total N. Pacific area).
 
Sei whale 
14,000 individuals * 16,811 kg/individual (Gambell 1985b) * ½ year / 20 million km
2 
(total N. Pacific area). 
Minke whale 
In the initial model a minimal estimate of 0.001 t/km
2
 was assumed.  Buckland et al. 
(1992) estimate of 5,841 individuals over 2.1 million km
2
 (WSA area) for half the year 
(0.009 t/km
2
).   
Northern fur 
seal 
Springer et al. (1999) estimate 175,000 over 20 million km
2 
(total N. Pacific area) 
south of the Aleutian Islands for half the year.  (Compare to 190,000 from Buckland 
et al. 1993).  An average body weight of 28 kg is given by Hunt et al. (2000).  Small 
and DeMaster (1995) give a population of 1 million individuals in the Pribilof Islands 
while Bigg (1990) notes that 10-15% of these travel into the gyres for half the year or 
less. 
Elephant seal 
Stewart et al. 1994 give a eastern North Pacific estimate of 127,000;  however only 
adult males forage in the Eastern Gyre.  Scaling gives 8,400 animals at 371 kg body 
weight over, 3,600,000 km (eastern Pacific), for ½ year. 
Dall’s porpoise 
1,925,000 (Hunt et al. 2000 Table 9.11);  compare to 1,200,000 from Buckland et al. 
1993 * 61 kg each/ 20 million km
2
 (subarctic and transition zones). 
Pacific 
whitesided 
dolphin 
1 million at 79 kg each/20 million km
2
 (Buckland et al. 1993).  Estimate may be high 
due to vessel attraction during surveys (Angliss et al. 2001). 
Northern right 
whale dolphin 
740,000 (Hunt et al. 2000, Table 9.7) at 105 kg each over 20 million km
2
 (subarctic 
and transition zones), compare to 68,000 for ESA (Buckland et al. 1993). 
Common

Minimal estimate of 0.001 t/km

Total bird biomass density in the gyres is reported 
to be 0.0008 in the ESA and 0.0038 in the WSA 
(Hunt et al. 2000).  To weight this total by 
different bird groups, species were weighted by 
residency days in the gyres and body weight to 
find the percentage of the total bird biomass 
consisting of each species.  Species representing 
the cumulative 95% of the bird biomass were 
included in the model, groups as albatrosses, 
shearwaters, storm petrels, kittiwakes, fulmars, 
puffins, skuas and jaegers (Table A4). 
 
Mortality rates were not obtained and taken to be 
similar to eastern Bering Sea estimates of 0.05 to 
0.075 for large predatory birds, and 0.1 for smaller 
birds (Aydin et al. 2002).  Consumption rates and 
diets were taken from Hunt et al. (2000) (which 
reported allometric energy requirements and prey 
 
 
 
 
by general categories) and weighted by biomass of 
prey species within each category. 
 
Cephalopods 
 
Neon flying squid (Ommastrephes bartrami), 
boreal clubhook squid (Onychoteuthis 
borealijaponica), large gonatid squid (Family 
Gonatidae), and micronektonic squid were used in 
each gyre model.  Biomass for clubhook and large 
gonatid species in the ESA was calculated from 
measurements of catch-per-unit-effort in Hokkaido 
University research gillnet studies from the 1994-
1999, published yearly (for example, Faculty of 
Fisheries Hokkaido 2000).  The CPUE values 
were reported for Pacific salmon and other fish of 
similar size, including pomfret and large squid (as 
individuals per unit of research net).  It was 
assumed that the ratio of CPUE (non-salmon 
species) / CPUE (total salmon) was equal to the 
ratio of biomass (non-salmon species) / biomass 
(total salmon).  To solve for the biomass of non-
salmon species, the biomass of salmon species 
used was that from the run reconstruction method 
detailed below.  Neon flying squid biomass was 
reported by Shimizaki (1986).  In the WSA, squid 
biomass was taken from Russian sources cited in 
Table B2.  P/B ratios for all of the large squid was 
taken to be the same as reported for neon flying 
squid, of 0.07 per 10 days or 2.555 per year 
(Murata and Shimazu 1982).  Q/B ratios from 
Brodeur et al. (1999) are reported as 0.02 per day 
for clubhook and large gonatid squid (7.3/year) 
and 0.017 for neon flying squid (6.2/year).  Squid 
diets were from research gillnet studies (Ishida 
unpublished data). 
 
Micronektonic squid, primarily gonatids such as 
Berryteuthis anonychus and Gonatus onyx are an 
extremely important food source for species across 
the subarctic gyres, especially in the Subarctic 
Current (Pearcy et al. 1988; Aydin et al. 1998).  
No estimate for their biomass was available so it 
was estimated by setting their EE to 0.90 in both 
models.  References for P/B and Q/B ratios are 
given in Table B2. 
 
Fish 
 
Pacific salmon.  Six species of Pacific salmon 
were included in the models as separate groups: 
steelhead (Onchorhynchus mykiss); chinook 
salmon (O. tshawytscha); coho salmon (O. 
kisutch); sockeye salmon (O. nerka); chum salmon 
(O. keta); and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha).  Due 
to their commercial importance salmon were the 
species with the most data available, however 
much of this data is concentrated around the early 
or late stages of their life cycle outside of the 
gyres. 
 
For biomass, two basic methods were available.  
The first was to use run (returning salmon) 
reconstruction records (catch + escapement) for 
Pacific Rim stocks in conjunction with mortality 
and migration studies, to determine the percentage 
of each salmon stock’s life-history cycle in the 
gyres.  The second was to use direct survey 
estimates.  The first method has the advantage of 
taking into account all seasons and life stages of 
the salmon, as well as allowing for reconstruction 
historical biomass levels.  Its disadvantage is that 
it relies on indirect measures of migration such as 
non-quantitative tagging studies.  The second 
method provides a direct point estimate of a catch-
per-unit-effort, but this may be difficult to 
calibrate to biomass and in addition may cover 
only brief periods of the year. 
 
Initially, the first method was used for both gyres 
combining Pacific-wide stock-specific run 
reconstructions from 1950-1998 (Rogers 1999) 
with salmon body weight by month (Ishida et al. 
1993), mortality estimates (Pauly and Christensen 
1996) and tagging studies (Myers et al. 1996).  
The values are averaged for the period 1990-98 
and shown in Table A5.  For the ESA, the run 
reconstruction values show a pattern similar to 
results from Pauly and Christensen (1996). 
 
In the WSA, two additional sources of data were 
provided from surveys.  The first, a combination 
of values from Shuntov et al. (1993 a,b) and 
Shuntov et al. (1995) was used in the final model.  
These data were collected from the northwest 
sections of the WSA near Kamchatka.  However, 
original data from research cruises (TINRO 1998 
a,b) provided finer spatial resolution;  when 
“Kamchatka Current” stations were removed the 
results were a synthesis of TINRO data sources 
that were oriented towards the central gyres.  The 
biomass levels from this TINRO synthesis are 
 
 
 
 
more similar to run reconstruction values than 
Shuntov et al. (1993 a,b; 1995), especially in 
showing a lower level of pink salmon biomass. 
 
Overall, the run reconstruction methods showed a 
considerably higher proportion of sockeye and 
chum salmon in gyres, and a lower proportion of 
pink salmon, when compared with survey 
methods.  This is because the surveys are geared 
towards catching adult (maturing) salmon while 
the reconstructions take into account the juvenile 
biomass present in the multi-year life history of 
chum and sockeye salmon. 
 
For historical fitting found in the main text, the run 
reconstructions for both the ESA and WSA were 
used to estimate gyre salmon biomass between 
1951-1996 (Fig. A1).

P/B and Q/B values for Pacific salmon were 
constructed from detailed bioenergetics models 
(Aydin 2000) based on growth rates reported by 
Ishida et al. (1998).  The freshwater and early 
ocean, and late (fishery) stages are not included, so 
this model does not capture the dynamics of the 
salmon fisheries implied by management of 
escapement and hatcheries, and no fishing of 
salmon is modeled. 
 
Diet habits of Pacific salmon for the 1990s can be 
found for the ESA in detail in Aydin (2000), and 
in summary in Kaeriyama et al. (2000);  the 
original data from these studies were pooled to 
construct the ESA diet tables.  WSA salmon diet 
data from similar studies were provided by Y. 
Ishida. 
 
Other fish.  The other piscivorous fish in the ESA 
and WSA models were sharks, primarily salmon 
sharks (sp) and pacific pomfret (Brama japonica).  
As mentioned under “Balancing the model” above, 
Pacific dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and 
daggertooth (Anotopterus pharao) were included 
in initial model drafts but later dropped. 
 
Several forage fish groups were modeled in the 
two systems.  Mesopelagic fish (mainly 
myctophidae, particularly Stenobrachius 
leucopsarus, see Beamish et al. 1999c for species 
lists); miscellaneous forage fish (mainly 
sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus); and saury 
(Cololabis saira) were modeled in both systems.  
There were two additional teleost groups in WSA 
gyre model:  Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) 
and Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonica). 
 
The data sources for biomass, P/B, and Q/B for 
these species are listed in Table B2;  the exception 
is for ESA pomfret biomass which was estimated 
by computing its CPUE ratio to total salmon 
biomass as described in the section on squids, 
above.  
 
Plankton 
 
For the ECOPATH model, zooplankton were 
divided into eleven groups:  microzooplankton 
(zooplankton <200 µm, typically meroplanktonic 
larvae and copepod nauplii); copepods; 
euphausiids; pteropods; amphipods (mainly 
hyperiids); sergestidae; chaetognaths; salps; 
ctenophores; large jellyfish; and an other group 
(mainly Larvaceans and Polychaetes).  A bacterial 
component was included in the initial balancing 
stages and in the model for Appendix B;  however 
this group was not used for ECOSIM simulations 
that included seasonal dynamics. 
 
ECOPATH model estimates for lower trophic 
levels were taken from outputs from the 
NEMURO model (Tables A6-A10).  NEMURO 
(North Pacific Ecosystem Model for 
Understanding Regional Oceanography) is a lower 
trophic level model (LTL) of a marine ecosystem 
that was developed by the PICES CCCC MODEL 
Task Team during a modeling workshop held in 
Nemuro, Japan, in 2000 (Eslinger et al. 2000, 
Megrey et al. 2000). NEMURO simulates the 
annual dynamics of phytoplankton, zooplankton 
and nutrient concentrations for two locations in the 
North Pacific, Ocean Station P (50ºN 145ºW) and 
station A7 (41.30ºN 145.30ºE) off the “A-line”, an 
oceanographic sampling line off Hokkaido Island, 
Japan.  For the ECOPATH models, only Ocean 
Station P results were used.  The diet composition 
for zooplankton groups were very similar in both 
gyre models.  Copepods, microzooplankton and 
phytoplankton are generally the major component 
of zooplankton diet.  Large jellyfish, chaetognaths, 
sergestid shrimp and amphipods feed mainly on 
copepods (60-80%).  The remaining zooplankton 
groups feed on copepods (25-40%), 
microzooplankton (20-40%) and phytoplankton 
(25-70%).  Microzooplankton diet is composed of 
small phytoplankton (75%) and bacteria (25%). 
 
The annual, gyre-scale averages used for 
zooplankton in the ECOPATH models cover a 
wide range of spatial, seasonal, and interannual 
variability which was not explicitly modeled.  
Mackas and Tsuda (1999) found that timing of 
spawning and age at first maturation for 
zooplankton have been later, slower and more 
narrowly seasonal in the northern parts of both 
gyres, particularly in the cold waters of the high 
latitude western marginal seas.  They further 
suggested that in all regions the annual biomass 
peak of mesozooplankton coincides with the time

period when late copepodites of Neocalanus spp. 
are the most abundant above the pycnocline 
(sometime between May and July). 
 
Taniguchi (1999) noted that the Eastern Gyre area 
generally has the lowest chlorophyll levels (0.3 
µg/L) in the North Pacific, while Western Gyre 
levels are slightly higher (0.5 µg/L).  Station P 
exhibits a consistently low biomass with little 
seasonality.  Chlorophyll concentrations are very 
low but annual primary productivity is quite high, 
primarily from small phytoplankton <5 µm 
(prasinophytes, prymnesiophytes, cryptophytes 
and cyanobacteria). The productivity is derived 
mainly from regenerated production, and about 
21% from new production. Taniguchi (1999) 
reported nitrate levels of 16 µg/L in winter, and 8 
µg/L in summer.  
 
Nitrogen uptake rates are influenced by light, 
temperature, available nitrogen sources, iron 
concentration, and competition from bacteria. 
Harrison et al. (1999) suggest that nitrogen uptake 
by larger (>5 µm) diatom cells may be influenced 
by iron concentration, which can be introduced to 
the gyre system by various sources, one of the 
most important being atmospheric transport of 
dust from land sources.   
 
Harrison et al. (1999) found that small cells in the 
Eastern Gyre can grow at near maximum growth 
rates, and are grazer controlled.  Small 
 
 
 
 
phytoplankton are controlled by grazing 
microzooplankton, which can grow rapidly to 
respond to changes in growth rate of the small 
phytoplankton, and may exert a greater control 
than mesozooplankton grazing.  
 
Harrison et al. (1999) reported greater seasonality 
in phytoplankton in the Western Gyre compared to 
the Eastern Gyre.  Diatom cells have been reported 
in higher numbers in the Western than in the 
Eastern Gyre in spring and summer.  Picoplankton 
(<2 µm) are predominant in the summer, but when 
chlorophyll concentrations are over 1 µg/L, 
phytoplankton >10 µm make up 60% of the total 
chlorophyll concentration.  There is a late autumn 
increase in chlorophyll concentration in the 
Western Gyre, but summer productivity values are 
similar between the Western Gyre and values 
obtained at Station P. 
 
One iron enrichment study in the Western Gyre 
indicated that iron may limit primary productivity 
of large cells in this gyre as well.  Larger cells are 
dominated by Thalassiosira, unlike the Eastern 
Gyre where pennate diatoms were observed with 
iron enrichment.  The 10 µM ambient nitrate was 
depleted in 5 days, and ambient chlorophyll 
increased from 1.3 to 5 µg/L with the introduction 
of iron.  Surface iron concentrations in the 
Western Gyre are low during the low dust season 
(summer and fall), at which time the iron levels 
are similar to those found in the Eastern Gyre.  
Deposition of dust has been suggested to result in 
an increase in primary productivity during the 
dusty season. 
 
Taniguchi (1999) suggested the Western Gyre 
contains a similar percent contribution from 
micro-sized dinoflagellates to total flagellate 
biomass as is found in the Eastern Gyre.  He also 
noted that the Western Gyre has more standing 
stock of microzooplankton than the Oyashio 
Region, but less than the Eastern Gyre. 
Microzooplankton grazing may control 
phytoplankton in most regions of the subarctic 
Pacific, except in the Oyashio region.   
 
Harrison et al. (1999) reported inshore stations in 
the Eastern Gyre have diatom dominated spring 
and summer blooms, when growth rate is likely 
limited by nitrogen, and sedimentation occurs as 
diatoms sink out.  Oceanic stations show little 
seasonality in biomass;  however, they have a 
pronounced seasonal cycle in primary production.   
The biomass is dominated by small cells.  
Sedimentation is low compared to inshore stations.  
Higher diatom abundance is recorded 
occasionally, maybe indicating variation in the 
iron supply.  
 
Mackas and Tsuda (1999) found higher population 
biomass and individual growth rates of 
zooplankton near land and on the Asian side of the 
basin, consistent with the hypothesis that the rate 
of supply of iron from land limits some primary 
productivity. 
 
Brodeur and Ware (1992) found an increase in the 
biomass of mesozooplankton in the Gulf of Alaska 
(ESA) from 113 mg wet weight/m
3
 in 1956-1962, 
to 194 mg wet weight/m
3
 in 1980-1989.  Findings 
by Mackas and Tsuda (1999) are in agreement, 
indicating that the summer season biomass of 
mesozooplankton in the Eastern Gyre was a factor 
or two higher in the 1980s than in the 1950s and 
1960s, and these changes correlated with large 
scale atmospheric and oceanographic changes, as 
well as interdecadal changes in pelagic fish 
production.   
 
Brodeur and Ware (1995) reported that biomass 
for the Eastern Gyre was 213 mg wet fish 
weight/m
3
 before 1980, and 168 mg wet weight/m
3
 
after 1980.  Mackas and Tsuda (1999) found a 
similar decrease in zooplankton from the  
mid-1960s – early 1970s through to the late 1970s 
and 1980s in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition area 
of the Western North Pacific.

APPENDIX C:  BASS WORKSHOP ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 
CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF THE SUBARCTIC PACIFIC BASIN 
ECOSYSTEMS 
 
At the PICES Sixth Annual Meeting, the BASS 
Task Team sponsored a symposium on the 
ecosystem dynamics of the Eastern and Western 
Subarctic Gyres.  The purpose was to bring 
together available information on the two gyres in 
a comparative framework.  Topics included:   
1) ocean responses to climate forcing, 2) nutrients 
and primary production, 3) structure of the lower 
trophic levels, the mesozooplankton communities, 
and the epipelagic nekton, 4) the role of midwater 
fishes, and 5) the importance of these areas to 
marine birds and mammals.  Papers presented at 
the meeting were published in 1999, in a special 
issue of Progress in Oceanography (Vol. 43,  
No. 2-4) entitled Ecosystem Dynamics in the 
Eastern and Western Gyres of the Subarctic 
Pacific (Guest Editors:  R.J. Beamish, S. Kim,  
M. Terazaki and W.S. Wooster).  The following 
“key” research problems were pointed out during 
discussion at the symposium:  1) the need for 
information on short-term or seasonal changes in 
the mixed layer, 2) how climate-variation may be 
changing the stability of the water column, 3) the 
role of iron: understanding transport mechanisms, 
4) community dynamics and the need for small 
scale diet studies, and 5) biomass estimates of 
some “key” species. 
 
Members of the BASS Task Team felt that the 
next step should be to develop a conceptual model 
of the subarctic Pacific basin ecosystems and 
begin to examine appropriate models.  A 2-day 
BASS Workshop on this topic was convened prior 
to the PICES Ninth Annual Meeting in Hakodate, 
Japan (October 20-21, 2000).  The objective of 
this workshop was to identify appropriate 
approaches, not only modelling approaches but 
also how to develop studies which will answer 
some of the questions. 
 
At the workshop, a number of presentations were 
made on ecosystem models that participants had 
used (see Endnote C1 for attendance).  These 
models were reviewed and discussed with respect 
to their utility for gyre systems.  Trophodynamic 
linkages that were likely to be common, as well as 
those that were model-specific, were identified, 
and shortfalls were highlighted.  Discussions 
included identifying data groups and potential data 
sources, incorporating climate and oceanographic 
changes in models, and linking gyre models to 
coastal area models.  Extended abstracts of papers 
given at the workshop are published in PICES 
Scientific Report No. 17, 2001.   
 
As the PICES CCCC Program enters its synthesis 
phase, modelling will play a more prominent role 
in CCCC activity.  Participants recommended the 
BASS and MODEL Task Teams to convene a 
joint workshop to examine the feasibility of using 
the ECOPATH/ECOSYSTEM modelling 
approach as a means to organize our 
understanding of the marine ecosystems of the 
subarctic gyres.  Specific objectives are to:  
 
null synthesize all trophic level data in a common 
format;  
null examine trophic relations in both gyres using 
ECOPATH/ECOSIM/ECOSPAC;  and 
null examine methods of incorporating the PICES 
NEMURO lower trophic level model into the 
analysis. 
 
Participants recommended that collaboration and 
synthesis of the data into a common format take 
place prior to the workshop.  Gordon McFarlane 
would co-ordinate this issue for North America 
and Andrei Krovnin and Akihiko Yatsu for Asia.  
Kerim Aydin will synthesize the data into the 
ECOPATH format.  If possible, the workshop 
should be held in conjunction with the PICES 
Census of Marine Life Workshop to be convened 
March 7-9, 2001, in Honolulu.  Locating the venue 
in Hawaii at this time is seen as a cost-effective 
way to involve workshop participants from both 
sides of the Pacific and would lead to a more 
balanced scientific representation from the nations 
of the North Pacific.

APPENDIX D:  BASS/MODEL WORKSHOP ON HIGHER TROPHIC 
LEVEL MODELING  
 
The PICES BASS/MODEL Workshop to examine 
the feasibility of using ECOPATH/ECOSIM as a 
tool to model higher trophic level components of 
the Subarctic gyre systems, was held March 5-6, 
2001, in Honolulu, U.S.A.  The participants are 
listed in Endnote D1.  Objectives of the workshop 
were to: 
 
null synthesize all trophic level data in a common 
format; 
null examine trophic relationships in both the 
Eastern Subarctic Gyre (ESA) and Western 
Subarctic Gyre (WSA) using 
ECOPATH/ECOSIM;  and 
null examine methods of incorporating the PICES 
NEMURO lower trophic level model into the 
analysis. 
 
Overview of ECOPATH/ECOSIM 
 
Kerim Aydin gave a brief overview of 
ECOPATH/ECOSIM.  An ECOPATH model 
creates a quantitative food web using the principle 
of mass-balance.  Each “box” in an ECOPATH 
model may represent a single species or a species 
guild.  The units may vary from model to model.  
The following quantities were used as input for the 
initial ESA and WSA models: 
 
• Biomass (t/km
2
) 
• Production per unit biomass (year
-1
) 
• Consumption per unit biomass (year
-1
) 
• Fisheries catch (t/km
2
/year) 
• Diet matrix for each predator (% of diet by 
weight, shown here as trophic level) 
 
From this information, ECOPATH calculates an 
“Ecotrophic Efficiency” for each box, which  
represents the ratio between the production of each 
box and the amount of biomass “demanded” by 
the predators and fisheries on a box.  An 
Ecotrophic Efficiency greater than 1 indicates that, 
according to the model, more is being demanded
of a box than is being produced.  This quantity is a 
useful diagnostic tool for examining the quality of 
data between boxes. 
 
The inputs used for each box in the ESA and WSA 
models are shown in Tables D1 and D2.  No 
fishing was included in the model as befits the 
subarctic North Pacific in the early 1990s.  These 
values represent the model as it existed at the end 
of the workshop and incorporate adjustments made 
over the course of the workshop.  This model was 
“mass-balanced” in that all Ecotrophic Efficiency 
values were less than 1. 
 
Data quality was categorized as follows (Tables 
D1 and D2): 
 
• Acceptable:  generally considered to be 
“reasonable” estimates for model use; 
• General:  consistent with known patterns for 
the species in question, but may be improved 
through re-examination of existing data, or 
further consultation with other researchers; 
• Poor:  little information for these species, or 
the information available to the workshop was 
known to be potentially inaccurate (collected 
outside the model domain); 
• N/A:  no data available; estimates were 
derived from ECOPATH model. 
 
There is considerable room for improving the 
estimates, and every attempt should be made to 
upgrade most of the estimates from “General” to 
“Acceptable” before the model is considered 
“functional”.  It was felt that much improvement 
in data quality could be accomplished by re- 
reviewing existing data using this preliminary 
model as a framework.  Final data quality is a 
combination of two properties:  the quality of each 
datum, and the sensitivity of the model to that 
input.

The boundary areas selected for the two 
ECOPATH models coincide with PICES’ 
definitions of the Western Subarctic and the 
Eastern Subarctic, namely the regions above 45°N, 
bounded by the shelf breaks and divided by 
165°W.  The total areas for the WSA and the ESA 
are 2,168,000 km
2
 and 3,622,000 km
2
 respectively. 
 
Overview of NEMURO  
 
Bernard Megrey gave a brief review of the 
NEMURO lower trophic level model focusing on 
recent improvement to NEMURO.  Topics 
included the addition of diagnostic calculations, 
validation to Station P data, addition of 
zooplankton vertical migration, examining the 
effects of including a microbial loop 
approximation, and performing a sensitivity 
analysis and data assimilation. 
 
Diagnostic calculations 
 
In order to perform regional comparisons of model 
performance, several diagnostic calculations were 
added to NEMURO.  These included production/ 
biomass (P/B) ratios for phytoplankton and 
zooplankton, food consumption/biomass (C/B) 
ratios for small, large and predatory zooplankton, 
and ecotrophic efficiency (a measure of how much 
primary production transfers up the food web to 
the zooplankton species and ultimately to higher 
trophic level species) calculations. 
 
Comparison of model output and measurements  
 
NEMURO was parameterized for Ocean Station P 
and output was compared to data collected from 
that site.  Results were favourable. The C/B and 
P/C ratios are both reasonable.  Annual primary 
production from the model (149 gC/m
2
/yr) is only 
6% higher than the best current estimate  
(140 gC/m
2
/yr).  An f-ratio (assuming that the 
production of the large phytoplankton is primarily 
fuelled by “new” nitrogen was 0.23. 
 
Vertical migration 
 
At Station P, during spring, the large zooplankton 
component (ZP) should be dominated by 
Calanus/Neocalanus spp. which undergo a strong 
ontogenetic vertical migration.  Thus, the model 
population should increase in biomass in the early 
spring independently of food availability/grazing.  
Later in the year, the population should decrease 
by some amount to simulate the descent of the 
large zooplankton to deeper depths.  NEMURO 
was modified to reflect this situation. 
 
Results without migration of predatory 
zooplankton (ZP) show a large diatom bloom 
around day 73.  The prevailing view is that there is 
no spring bloom at Station P.  Thus the bloom is 
an artifact of the “box” nature of the model.  With 
ZP migration, values of PL drop by a factor of 2 
and generate more reasonable diagnostics.  The 
estimates of Ecotropic Efficiency are not 
significantly affected. 
 
Microbial loop approximation 
 
Climate change patterns that produce warmer 
water and greater rainfall enhance stratification of 
the water column.  This lowers primary production 
by reducing or eliminating the mixing that is 
needed to propel nutrients into the surface photic 
zone.  Data from Station P show decreased 
nitrogen and reduced primary production with 
warmer temperatures over a period of about 25 
years.  These conditions change the quantity of 
phytoplankton as well as the phytoplankton 
assemblage.  With high nutrient concentrations, 
large phytoplankton that are eaten by copepods 
dominate the phytoplankton assemblage (i.e. the 
pelagic food chain).  This energy is transferred to 
larval and adult planktivorous fishes.  With low 
nutrient concentrations, the phytoplankton 
assemblage is altered, with the microbial loop food 
chain being favoured over the pelagic food chain.  
Small nanoplankton are favoured, which are eaten 
by protozoans like rotifers, with secondary 
production generally becoming unavailable to fish. 
 
A pragmatic approach to including the microbial 
food web is through the variable BetaZS (growth 
efficiency of Small Zooplankton, ZS) 
 
BetaZS = 0.3 (1+ PhySn/(PhySn+PhyLn)) 
 
This means that the gross growth efficiency of the 
small zooplankton can vary between 0.09 and 0.3, 
and will probably average about 0.16 over the year 
 
 
 
 
at Station P.  For the base model run, a constant 
BetaZS=0.3 was used.  
 
Including a microbial loop had only a small impact 
on the standing stocks of small and large 
zooplankton.  Predatory zooplankton decreased by 
about one half reducing potentially available 
biomass for fish production.  These differences are 
due to the decreased net trophic efficiency of the 
system, which results when a large portion of the 
primary production passes through a microbial 
community before entering the zooplankton 
community. 
 
Sensitivity analysis 
 
A Monte Carlo analysis of the WSA with 600 
replications randomly varied the input parameters 
and initial values by ±10% using a uniform error 
distribution.  Principal component analysis (PCA) 
reduced the 600 sets of output of biological 
parameters and initial values.  The PCA indicated 
that four factors explained 22% of variance in the 
data.  The first principal component, was clearly 
related to photosynthesis of PL.  It accounted for 
10% of variance and was correlated with the 
variables VmaxS, VmaxL, and PL, NO
3
, NH
4
.  
The second principal component was related to the 
zooplankton state variables, ZL and ZS. 
 
Based on the sensitivity analysis, the parameters 
selected to estimate from the observed data were 
VmaxS, VmaxL, λP, MorZP0 and VD2N0.  Data 
from the A-line (off Hokkaido, Japan - outside the 
Oyashio region) was used with a conjugate 
gradient method to calculate the local minimum of 
the cost function, which is defined as the squared 
differences between observed and simulated data.  
After estimating these parameters, the time-
dependent features of each compartment of the 
NEMURO/FORTRAN Box model were 
calculated.

SSTO REVIEW ECOSYSTEM MODELS FOR THE SUBARCTIC PACIFIC GYRES 
APPENDIX E:  BASS/MODEL WORKSHOP TO REVIEW ECOSYSTEM 
MODELS FOR THE SUBARCTIC PACIFIC GYRES 
 
Workshop objectives 
 
The BASS/MODEL workshop on higher trophic 
level modeling (March 5-6, 2001, Honolulu, 
U.S.A.) recommended a 1-day workshop to 
evaluate the results of the inter-sessional workshop 
and initiate hypothesis testing using the models 
developed.  
 
This follow-up BASS/MODEL workshop was 
held October 5, 2001, immediately preceding the 
PICES Tenth Annual Meeting in Victoria, British 
Columbia, Canada (see Endnote E1 for 
attendance).  The objectives of the workshop were 
to: 
 
null assess the results of the March 2001 
workshop; 
null review progress on model development and 
updated models;  and 
null begin to develop scenarios to test key 
hypotheses. 
 
Review of baseline models 
 
The two ECOPATH/ECOSIM baseline models 
developed at the March 2001 workshop on higher 
trophic level modeling should be viewed as work 
in progress.  Estimates of biomass, productivity to 
biomass, consumption rate to biomass and diet 
composition were compiled from the literature and 
from research data provided by PICES member 
countries.  In general, information available for 
1990 (or 1990-1993) was used such that the two 
models could be viewed as representative of the 
early 1990s conditions.  In total, 56 species groups 
(with three detrital groups) were included in the 
models, however some species were not common 
to both regions.  Minke whales, common dolphin, 
Japanese sardines and anchovies were present in 
the Western Subarctic Gyre (WSA) model, but not 
in the Eastern Subarctic Gyre (ESA) model.  
Conversely, elephant seals were present in the 
ESA model only.  Many of the estimates are at 
best only guesses.  Some observations were 
derived from coastal ecosystems and therefore 
may not be applicable to gyre ecosystems. 
 
In general, the total biomass estimated for the 
WSA was higher than for the ESA.  Major 
differences between the two model regions include 
higher biomasses of flying squid and Pacific 
pomfret in the ESA, higher biomass of 
chaetognaths in the WSA, and higher salmon 
biomass in the WSA (pink salmon) than in the 
ESA (sockeye salmon).  Marine mammal biomass 
estimates were identical for each region since they 
were derived from basic-scale North Pacific 
estimates.  No biomass estimates of forage fish 
and micronektonic species groups were available 
from the literature or from research survey data, so 
these were evaluated by top-down balancing of 
each model.  Biomass estimates for lower trophic 
level plankton groups were derived from outputs 
of the NEMURO model that had been calibrated 
for Ocean Station P in the ESA. 
 
Productivity values were derived from mortality 
rates.  Consumption rates were obtained from diet 
composition and laboratory descriptions of 
calories/gram for prey species.  Both production 
and consumption estimates were weighted by 
residence time for migratory species.  The 
estimates for lower trophic levels (e.g. large 
zooplankton) were taken from other ECOPATH 
models and, in some cases, from the NEMURO 
model. 
 
All information on diet composition was poor.  
Marine mammal diets were not as detailed as fish 
diets.  Salmon diets were specific and detailed 
with many stomachs sampled over large areas and 
seasons, however, only summer estimates were 
available for the WSA.  The major difference 
between the WSA and ESA were the seasonal 
differences in the diet of salmon since WSA 
included sockeye salmon in May.  Early spring 
diet estimates for the early 1990s were not 
available for the ESA.  Physical forcing inputs to 
the NEMURO model can be generated to produce 
phytoplankton and zooplankton outputs.  
 
 
 
 
Maximum photosynthetic rates, zooplankton 
growth efficiencies and microbial loops can be 
modified and initiated to provide various climate 
change scenarios.  These outputs can be used in 
ECOSIM. 
 
Update of ECOPATH/ECOSIM models 
 
Kerim Aydin reviewed the updated 
ECOPATH/ECOSIM baseline models.  Figures E1 
and E2 show composite images of the food webs 
for the Eastern and Western Pacific Subarctic 
Gyres.  These models were initially constructed 
from data assembled at the March 2001 
BASS/MODEL workshop and updated by 
including results of lower trophic level modeling 
by the MODEL Task Team and upper trophic 
level data from a wide range of sources on both 
sides of the Pacific.   
 
Future adjustments to the models based on 
additional data presented at the Victoria workshop 
will be incorporated into the final versions of these 
models and presented at an inter-sessional 
BASS/MODEL workshop to be convened in April 
2002.  This will lead to a PICES Scientific Report

to document the models and assess the overall 
state of knowledge of food web interactions and 
critical dynamic links in subarctic gyre 
ecosystems.  In addition, the April 2002 meeting 
will focus on the potential to incorporate dynamic 
simulations of climate into these models. 
 
This continuing synthesis highlighted some key 
areas for future research, for example, the 
exploration of dynamics of the intermediate 
trophic levels such as micronektonic squid, small 
forage fish, and mesopelagic fish (Fig. E2).  The 
biology of these species is currently poorly 
understood and yet central to the functioning of 
the subarctic food web. 
 
Another key direction for future work lies in 
developing methods to integrate gyre processes 
with boundary currents and near-shore processes.  
Specifically, concurrently examining the dynamics 
of boundary current species such as the Pacific 
sardine and Japanese anchovy in relation to the 
dynamics of the salmon-dominated subarctic gyre 
ecosystems that were simulated by these models, 
will increase our understanding of North Pacific-
wide climate systems and their interrelations with 
coastal systems. 
 
 
 
 
Recent improvements to NEMURO model 
 
Bernard Megrey reviewed recent progress and 
improvements on the NEMURO lower trophic 
level modelling efforts.  
 
Diagnostic calculations  
 
Several diagnostic calculations were added to the 
NEMURO model.  These included production/ 
biomass (P/B) ratios for phytoplankton and 
zooplankton, food consumption/biomass (C/B) 
ratios for small, large and predatory zooplankton, 
and ecotrophic efficiency (a measure of how much 
primary production transfers up the food web to 
the zooplankton species and ultimately to higher 
trophic level species). 
 
Validation to Station P 
 
The NEMURO model was parameterized for 
Ocean Station P and output was compared to data 
collected from that site.  Results were favourable.  
NEMURO provides reasonable C/B and P/C 
ratios.  Annual primary production from the model 
(149 gC/m
2
/yr) is only 6% higher than the best 
current estimate (140 gC/m
2
/yr) by Wong et al. 
(1995).  Average chlorophyll concentration from 
the model (0.42 mg/m
3
) is only 5% higher than the 
long-term value (0.4 mg/m
3
) measured by Wong et 
al. (1995).  An f-ratio (assuming that the 
production of the large phytoplankton is primarily 
fuelled by “new” nitrogen) is in a good agreement 
with the estimate by Wong et al. (1995):  0.23 and 
0.25 respectively. 
 
Zooplankton vertical migration 
 
Results without ontogenetic migration of 
predatory zooplankton (ZP) show a large diatom 
bloom around day 73 (Fig. E3, top panel).  The 
prevailing view is that there is no spring bloom at 
Station P.  Thus the bloom is an artifact of the 
“box” nature of the model.  Adding ZP migration, 
decreases biomass of phytoplankton by a factor of 
2 (Fig. E3, bottom panel) and generates more 
reasonable diagnostics.  The estimates of 
ecotrophic efficiency are not significantly affected. 
 
 
Fig. E3 Comparison of NEMURO output with  
(bottom panel) and without (top panel) ontogenetic 
migration of large zooplankton. 
 
Fig. E4 Comparison of NEMURO output with 
and without the microbial loop approximation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Microbial loop  
 
Inclusion of a microbial loop had only a small 
impact on the standing stocks of small and large 
zooplankton (Fig. E4).  Predatory zooplankton 
decreased by about one half, reducing potentially 
available biomass for fish production.  These 
differences are due to the decreased net trophic 
efficiency of the system because a large portion of 
the primary production passes through a microbial 
community before entering the zooplankton 
community. 
 
Recent progress 
 
MODEL Task Team also conducted a sensitivity 
analysis and data assimilation for Station A7 
(WSA) and added carbon fluxes to the LTL 
model.   
 
The most recent improvements to the NEMURO 
model include: 
 
• Acquired SST time series from Station P 
1951-1988; 
• Acquired equations to permit calculation of 
light at the surface; 
• Modified primary production equations to 
explicitly include mixed layer depth (MLD) to 
permit simulation of regime shift scenarios. 
 
Hypothesis testing scenarios 
 
The following scenarios were suggested: 
 
null Examine impact of changes in primary and 
secondary production on each gyre.  Do they 
respond similarly or differently? 
null Examine seasonality of changes in each 
system; 
null Examine the role of primary production 
increases on sockeye salmon abundance; 
null Examine role of predation in the regulation of 
population abundance: 
o shark/salmon 
o marine mammal/salmon 
null Examine role of marine birds in each gyre; 
null Examine role of forage fish in each gyre; 
null Examine species competition for prey, e.g. 
pink/sockeye salmon;  pomfret/squid, etc. 
 
Recommendations 
 
1. Convene a joint BASS/MODEL workshop in 
April 2002 to continue hypotheses testing of 
the models developed at the 2001 inter-
sessional workshop and refined at the Tenth 
Annual Meeting; 
2. Parameterize the WSA model, in particular 
finalize the boundary to exclude the transition 
area; 
3. Calibrate and validate the NEMURO model to 
Station A7, which is more appropriate for the 
Western Subarctic Gyre; 
4. For both the Eastern and Western Gyre 
models, incorporate time series (from the 
NEMURO model) for light, SST, etc., to 
generate primary productivity and 
zooplankton time series; 
5. Hypotheses to be tested should be developed 
prior to the 2002 inter-sessional workshop and 
should focus on climate change scenarios; 
6. Complete final data synthesis (including 
marine birds and mammals) prior to the 2002 
inter-sessional workshop; 
7. Following the inter-sessional workshop, 
prepare the two baseline models for 
publication in the PICES Scientific Report 
Series, including the results of hypotheses 
testing, and a data inventory; 
8. PICES provide a means of accessing these 
models, and other workshop products on the 
web; 
9. BASS/MODEL/REX Task Teams convene a 
joint session with GLOBEC at the PICES 
Eleventh Annual Meeting to examine 
“Approaches for linking basin scale models to 
coastal ecosystem models”;  
10. Given the limited data on diet of many species 
inhabiting the gyres, PICES should encourage 
researchers to collect and collate diet data for 
species in these areas and sponsor the 
development of “Diet database” which would 
be peer-reviewed and citable.

APPENDIX F:  BASS/MODEL WORKSHOP ON “PERTURBATION 
ANALYSIS” ON SUBARCTIC PACIFIC GYRE ECOSYSTEM MODELS 
USING ECOPATH/ECOSIM 
 
Background 
 
At the PICES Sixth Annual Meeting (October 
1997, Pusan, Republic of Korea) the BASS Task 
Team sponsored a symposium on Ecosystem 
Dynamics in the Eastern and Western Subarctic 
Gyres.  The purpose was to bring together 
available information on the two gyres in a 
comparative framework.  Topics included:  1) 
ocean responses to climate forcing, 2) nutrients 
and primary production, 3) structure of the lower 
trophic levels, mesozooplankton communities and 
epipelagic nekton, 4) mid-water fishes, and 5) the 
importance of these areas to marine birds and 
mammals.  Papers presented at the meeting were 
published in 1999, in a special issue of Progress in 
Oceanography (Vol. 43, No. 2-4). 
 
A series of follow-up workshops was convened to 
identify potential models which might have utility 
for examining gyre systems.  This included:  the 
BASS Workshop on Development of a conceptual 
model of the subarctic Pacific basin ecosystem 
(October 20-21, 2000, in conjunction with the 
PICES Ninth Annual Meeting in Hakodate, 
Japan), the BASS/MODEL Workshop on Higher 
trophic level modeling (March 5-6, 2001, in 
Honolulu, U.S.A.) and the BASS/MODEL

Workshop to Review ecosystem models for the 
Subarctic Pacific Gyres (October 5, 2001, 
immediately preceding the PICES Tenth Annual 
Meeting in Victoria, Canada).  At these 
workshops, the BASS and MODEL Task Teams 
examined the feasibility of using the 
ECOPATH/ECOSIM modelling approach as a 
means to organize our understanding of 
ecosystems of the subarctic gyres.  
 
The BASS/MODEL Workshop to test the baseline 
models developed at the March 2001 workshop, 
and refined at the PICES Tenth Annual Meeting, 
was held April 21-22, 2002, in La Paz, Mexico 
(See Endnote F1 for attendance).  Specific 
objectives of the workshop were:   
 
null synthesize all trophic level data in a common 
format; 
null examine trophic relations in both gyres using 
ECOPATH/ECOSIM;  and 
null examine methods of incorporating the PICES 
NEMURO lower trophic level model into the 
analysis. 
 
Review of baseline models 
 
ECOPATH baseline models and the NEMURO 
model have been previously reviewed (PICES 
Scientific Report Nos. 17 and 21).  The two 
ECOPATH models produced at that workshop 
should be viewed as work in progress.  Estimates 
of biomass, productivity to biomass, consumption 
rate to biomass and diet composition were 
compiled from the literature and from research 
data provided by PICES member countries.  In 
general, information available for 1990 (or 1990-
1993) was used such that the two models could be 
viewed as representative of the early 1990s 
conditions.  In total, 56 species groups (with three 
detrital groups) were included in the models, 
however, some species were not common to both 
regions.  For example, Minke whales, common 
dolphin, Japanese sardines and anchovies were 
present in the Western Subarctic Gyre (WSA) 
model but not in the Eastern Subarctic Gyre (ESA)  
model.  Conversely, elephant seals were present in 
the ESA model only.  Many of the estimates are at 
best only guesses.  Some observations were 
derived from coastal ecosystems and therefore 
may not be applicable to gyre ecosystems. 
 
In general, the total biomass estimated for the 
WSA was higher than for the ESA.  Major 
differences between the two model regions include 
higher biomasses of flying squid and Pacific 
pomfret in the ESA, higher biomass of 
chaetognaths in the WSA, and higher salmon 
biomass in the WSA (pink salmon) than in the 
ESA (sockeye salmon).  Marine mammal biomass 
estimates were identical for each region since they 
were derived from basic-scale North Pacific 
estimates.  No biomass estimates of forage fish 
and micronektonic species groups were available 
from the literature or from research survey data, so 
these were evaluated by top-down balancing of 
each model.  Biomass estimates for lower trophic 
level plankton groups were derived from outputs 
of the NEMURO model that had been calibrated 
for Ocean Station P in the ESA. 
 
NEMURO is a lower trophic level model (LTL) 
developed by the PICES MODEL Task Team 
during a modelling workshop held in Nemuro, 
Japan, in January 2000 (for details see Eslinger et 
al. (2000) and Megrey et al. (2000)).  NEMURO 
simulates the annual dynamics of phytoplankton, 
zooplankton and nutrient concentrations for two 
locations in the North Pacific, Ocean Station P 
(57.5°N, 175°W) and station A7 (41.30°N, 
145.30°E) off the A-line, an oceanographic 
sampling line off Hokkaido Island, Japan. 
 
Ten years of output from the NEMURO model 
was used to supply “bottom-up” forcing to the 
ECOPATH/ECOSIM models, configured for each 
subarctic gyre system.  NEMURO output from 
Ocean Station P was used to force the ESA 
ECOPATH/ECOSIM model, and output from 
station A7 was used to force the 
ECOPATH/ECOSIM WSA model.  The model 
connection was a static one-way linkage. 
 
 
 
 
Hypothesis testing 
 
The purpose of this approach was to provide a 
“picture” of the two subarctic gyres, and to 
facilitate our understanding of how these systems 
respond to natural and anthropogenic change.  It is 
hoped that it will form the basis of future work 
which will attempt to link the subarctic gyre 
systems to coastal systems. 
 
A number of hypotheses were discussed as 
appropriate proxies to test the response of the two 
gyres to various trophic level changes and climate 
change scenarios.  These were further refined into 
“Perturbation analyses” and “Function fitting and 
forcing”. 
 
Perturbation analyses 
 
null Bottom up pulse 
 
Rationale: Increasing primary production 
could elucidate any bottom-up effects. 
 
null Removal of squid 
 
Rationale: There is considerable confidence 
in the salmon diet composition for both gyres 
and discernible differences in the relative 
proportion of micronecktonic squid, forage 
fish and mesopelagic fish between the two 
gyre models.  Since neon flying squid and 
boreal clubhook are probably competitors for 
micronektonic squid and forage fishes, their 
removal may have implications for prey 
availability for salmonids. 
 
null Removal of salmon 
 
Rationale: Assuming that salmon abundance 
is determined outside of the gyre system, 
changes in abundance will greatly affect other 
trophic levels if salmon is a driving force 
within the gyre system. 
 
null Removal of sharks 
 
Rationale: Sharks were selected as 
representative of a higher trophic apex 
predator. 
 
Function fitting and forcing 
 
 Rationale: We were interested in 
investigating the changes that were required in 
productivity in order to explain changes in 
salmon abundance.  Forcing functions at 
different trophic levels could be calculated by 
fitting the function to known salmon 
abundance data.  We selected three trophic 
levels for which to fit foraging efficiency 
functions to salmon abundance trends, and 
then using the function to perturb the models:  
small phytoplankton, neon flying squid and 
sharks. 
 
The results of these analyses will be available 
shortly in a PICES Scientific Report.

APPENDIX G:  PROPOSAL FOR A BASS WORKSHOP ON LINKAGES 
BETWEEN OPEN AND COASTAL SYSTEMS 
 
Recent BASS/MODEL workshops synthesized 
data and examined trophic relationships in the 
Eastern and Western Subarctic Gyres.  These 
workshops facilitated our understanding of how 
these systems respond to natural and 
anthropogenic change.  Participants at these 
workshops suggested the next phase of this 
work, from the standpoint of understanding the 
gyres, would integrate coastal, marginal seas 
and boundary current dynamics and linkages 
between gyres.  To begin the process, this 
workshop will examine current information of 
the oceanographic and biological linkages 
between open ocean and coastal systems in the 
North Pacific.  Invited papers will be prepared 
by “teams” of investigators to assess 
existing information on linkages for various 
physical and biological components.  
Presentations will include reviews of physical 
oceanography, phytoplankton, zooplankton, 
migratory pelagics, mesopelagics, marine birds 
and marine mammals.  In addition, contributed 
papers, especially those attempting to develop 
conceptual models of physical or biological 
mechanisms that link coastal to open ocean 
systems, are encouraged.  Selected papers will 
be published in a special issue of Deep-Sea 
Research II (Elsevier).  Participants wishing to 
have their work considered for this publication 
should indicate their interest at the time of 
abstract submission, and be prepared to bring a 
completed manuscript to the Annual Meeting.
