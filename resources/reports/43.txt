Executive Summary 
 
In October 2007, the PICES Working Group on Comparative Ecology of Krill in Coastal and Oceanic Waters 
around the Pacific Rim (WG 23) was established under the direction of the Biological Oceanography 
Committee (BIO) with the following terms of reference: 
1. Assemble lists of existing data (including metadata) that contribute to an analysis of the comparative 
ecology of Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa species. Identify gaps in our understanding of krill 
ecology, life history, and population dynamics. 
2. Prepare a research plan to help fill gaps in our understanding and aid regional collaborative research 
efforts. Explore ways and means of facilitating exchange of scientists between laboratories and on research 
cruises.  
3. Convene “hands-on” practical workshops with krill biologists (including students and established 
scientists) from PICES member countries to help them initiate and carry out krill research programs. 
Workshops could be convened before PICES meetings, or at other times as appropriate.  A protocol for 
experimental work has already been published on the PICES website at: http://www.pices.int/projects/ 
Euphasiid/PICES%20Protocols%20COMPLETE.pdf.  
4. Initiate euphausiid research programs in PICES member countries which will include sampling on a 
regular basis (biweekly-monthly) to determine seasonal cycles of spawning and growth, and incubations of 
live animals for measurement of brood size and molting rates.  
5. Work with modelers to better parameterize euphausiids in the NEMURO and other models so as to 
explore their role in coastal and oceanic food chains.  
6. Convene a krill workshop at the GLOBEC Open Science Meeting (May 2009).  
7. Organize a Krill Symposium or a Topic Session at PICES XX in 2011, and submit a set of krill synthesis 
papers for a special issue of a scientific peer-reviewed journal. 
 
This report brings together reviews of the state of knowledge of Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa species 
in the six PICES member countries over the time period from 2008 to 2012.  The chances to conduct 
euphausiid research varied amongst countries, but PICES scientists rose to the challenge and made the most of 
the opportunities available to them.  From mining euphausiid data out of existing time-series data sets to 
conducting live euphausiid experiments (using the protocol available on the PICES website, 
http://www.pices.int/projects/Euphasiid/euphasiid.aspx), WG 23 members generated new and interesting data 
on euphausiids throughout the North Pacific.  Although we were not able to convene the hands-on workshop 
proposed in TOR #3, scientists from Chile, China, Japan, and Germany were able to travel to Newport, Oregon 
to work in the laboratory led by Dr. William (Bill) Peterson located at the Hatfield Marine Science Center, 
NOAA-Fisheries, and members of the Peterson lab visited China to work with Chinese colleagues and Korea 
to participate in several research cruises in the Yellow Sea.  These international collaborations involved 
experiments on live euphausiids, including molting and growth rates, egg production, feeding preferences and 
rates, and effects of hypoxia.    
 
WG 23 organized a workshop on “Krill biology and ecology in the world’s oceans” in conjunction with the 
GLOBEC Open Science Meeting in Victoria, Canada, in June 2009.  The objective of the workshop was to 
convene a gathering of krill biologists and ecologists from around the world to discuss the life history and 
population dynamics of all krill species.  The workshop was well attended and included presentations on 
euphausiid research from 11 countries (the UK, Germany, Australia, Peru, Chile, Mexico, USA, Canada, Japan, 
China and Korea).  Discussion of euphausiid research from these many geographic locations yielded several 
common themes: 
  
Executive Summary 
vi  PICES Scientific Report No. 43 
 current biomass calculations for all krill species are probably underestimates,  
 the roles of krill as both a predator and a prey item are not well understood, 
 there is a need to better understand krill behaviour, especially in regard to swarming,  
 there is a need for more pan-oceanic research to understand the impact of climate variability on krill 
ecology and production.  
 
In addition, we learned about promising results related to krill population dynamics using IBM models linked 
with ROMS (Regional Ocean Model System).  These model results show how euphausiid eggs (from broadcast 
spawners) and larvae are transported by interactions between currents and ontogenetic variations in vertical 
distribution. 
 
A special issue on krill biology and ecology was published in Deep-Sea Research Part II (Vol. 57, Issues 7–8) 
in April 2010.  This special issue was developed following the workshop “Krill research:  current status and 
its future” that took place in conjunction with the 4
th
 International Zooplankton Production Symposium in 
Hiroshima, Japan in 2007.  Guest editors were Drs. So Kawaguchi and William T. Peterson and the special 
issue was dedicated to the memory of Dr. Edward Brinton.  The volume comprises 17 original research papers 
from scientists in eight countries: Australia, Chile, China, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the UK, and the USA.   
 
 
Looking beyond WG 23 
At the final meeting of WG 23 in Khabarovsk, Russia, in 2011, it was clear from the presentations and 
discussion that there is still much more to be done on this topic and that some of our findings and work could 
serve as the basis for establishing a new working group.  We identified two topics that merit further attention 
and that would make substantial contributions to defining the role of euphausiids (and other zooplankton) in 
the marine environment.  One of these topics is euphausiid vital rates, including seasonal growth rates, lifetime 
fecundity, and mortality rates.  This information would improve our current models and enable us to predict 
with greater accuracy how euphausiids will be affected by changing environmental conditions.  This, in turn, 
will lead to more accurate assessments of the potential effects of environmental change on higher tropic levels.  
The other topic considered as the basis for a potential working group is a basin-scale comparison of the role of 
small pelagics in ecosystems (krill, anchovies, sardines, etc.) and how these might be modified by a changing 
climate.  Both of these topics are relevant within the context of the current PICES integrative science program 
on Forecasting and Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems 
(FUTURE).   
 
Potential subjects for a new zooplankton working group were discussed at PICES-2012 in Hiroshima, Japan, 
during the workshop on “Secondary production: Measurement methodology and its application on natural 
zooplankton community”.  Based on this discussion, we determined that a working group on zooplankton 
production would address many of the criteria of interest.  Currently, zooplankton production is usually 
determined using direct measurements such as molting rate experiments.  These methods are laborious and 
time consuming, and the results are not always conclusive.  Biochemical approaches to measuring zooplankton 
production have the potential to provide quick measurements using simple protocols, but need to be calibrated 
with direct measurements in order to facilitate comparisons amongst the different methods.  We propose to 
conduct an exchange program to cross-calibrate biochemical methods of measuring zooplankton production 
and growth (using a nucleic acids ratio, AARS, chitobiase, etc.) and validate these methods in relation to 
traditional methods (direct growth, molting rate, egg production, physiological rate, etc.).  Aspects of 
zooplankton biomass and species composition are relevant to researchers involved with modeling and 
monitoring, as well as scientists associated with PICES’ Biological Oceanography Committee, Fishery Science 
Committee and Technical Committee on Monitoring, but little attention is given to “rates” of growth and 
production.  Since rates are likely to be more sensitive to environmental changes than “biomass”, changes in 
rates could be excellent early indicators of responses to environmental change by the zooplankton community.  
The ability to make rapid assessments of changes in these rates has the potential to be a useful tool in 
elucidating the consequences of environmental change for the zooplankton community.  We suggest that the

PICES Scientific Report No. 43  vii 
FUTURE Advisory Panels on Climate, Oceanographic Variability and Ecosystems (COVE) and Status, 
Outlooks, Forecasts, and Engagement (SOFE) would be interested in incorporating a better understanding of 
zooplankton growth and production rates into (a) understanding the effects of climate variability on 
ecosystems (COVE) and (b) outlooks and ecosystem status (SOFE).  A proposed PICES working group on 
zooplankton production would clarify (1) methods of measurements of rates, and (2) recommend a set of 
techniques that could be adopted by scientists of both PICES and ICES member countries. 
 
Prospective activities of the new working group would include: 
1. Reviewing advantages and disadvantages of the current methodologies for zooplankton production;  
2. Championing an international research program to compare methodologies (including proposals for 
funding); 
3. Establishing a cooperative network between the PICES working group on zooplankton production and 
ICES working group on zooplankton ecology; 
4. Contributing to the updating of the ICES Zooplankton Methodology Manual (1
st
 Edition) on methods of 
measuring zooplankton production.

Section 1  Introduction

1 Introduction
Euphausiids are a key component of ecosystems throughout the North Pacific.  The species Euphausia pacifica 
has a pan-Pacific distribution and is generally the dominant species of euphausiid in most of the waters it 
inhabits (Brinton, 1962).  Euphausiids of the genus Thysanoessa are the next most common, though their 
ranges are more geographically restricted.  The fact that E. pacifica are found throughout the waters of all 
PICES member countries and the interest in whether data from various studies could provide insight into how 
this one species thrives in such a wide variety of ecosystems was the impetus for the establishment of the 
Working Group on Comparative Ecology of Krill in Coastal and Oceanic Waters around the Pacific Rim 
(WG 23).  This final report from WG 23 contains summary reports from each PICES member country that 
highlight past and ongoing research on euphausiids (Section 3).  Most countries do not have research projects 
specifically targeting euphausiids, so the data come from a variety of other sampling efforts which makes the 
amount of data available even more remarkable.  Data from the North Pacific Continuous Plankton Recorder 
(CPR) survey (Section 4) are presented separately from the summary reports since they comprise samples from 
the waters of several PICES member countries.  Modeling efforts used to parameterize euphausiids and 
explore their role in coastal and open-ocean food chains are discussed in Section 5.  The last section highlights 
other successful activities of WG 23, including international collaborations and a protocol for conducting live 
experiments on euphausiids.  The membership of WG 23 throughout its active period is listed in Appendix 1.  
The appendices also include a set of equations for converting among the different methods of measuring 
euphausiid length (Appendix 2) and an example of the questionnaire distributed to krill experts internationally 
(Appendix 3).  More details of the working history of WG 23 can be found in its Annual Reports (Appendix 4) 
and the PICES Press article about the Krill Biology and Ecology Workshop held during the 2009 GLOBEC 
Open Science Meeting (Appendix 5). 
  
1.1 A Proposal for the Formation of a Working Group on Comparative 
Ecology of Krill in Coastal and Oceanic Waters around the Pacific Rim  
 
Euphausiids are among the most important links in 
coastal and oceanic food webs, transferring energy 
from primary and secondary producers to higher 
trophic level animals such as salmon, herring, 
sardines, mackerel, Pacific whiting, sablefish, many 
rockfish species, auklets, shearwaters and whales. 
Given their importance in the food chain, euphausiids 
may be considered keystone sentinel species.  One 
species of euphausiid, Euphausia pacifica, is of 
special interest because it ranges from the cool 
upwelling regions off Mexico’s Baja California 
peninsula, California, Oregon, Washington, and 
British Columbia, into the downwelling environment 
of the Gulf of Alaska, and across the Pacific through 
the Transition Zone, then south through the western 
Pacific from Russia to China.  In the western Pacific 
this species inhabits waters where temperatures range 
from sub-arctic (e.g., the Oyashio and Bering Sea 
slope waters) to the sub-tropical (e.g., the Kuroshiro, 
the East China and Yellow seas).  There are few 
species that occupy such a wide variety of ecosystems 
and such a wide range of latitudes.  Thus, we ask, 
“What are the unique characteristics of the life history 
of this cosmopolitan euphausiid species that allow it 
not only to populate but dominate such a wide variety 
of ecosystems?” 
 
Surprisingly little information is available on the 
seasonal cycles of abundance, feeding, and 
reproduction, or on the growth rates of this species.  
Introduction  Section 1 
2  PICES Scientific Report No. 43 
Comparative studies are needed to understand their 
trophic status, their adaptations which allow them to 
prosper in so many different regions, and to learn how 
climate change may affect their population dynamics. 
Given that many scientists within PICES have made 
great progress in applying NEMURO (North Pacific 
Ecosystem Model for Understanding Regional 
Oceanography) and EcoSim models to the study of 
ecosystem dynamics, they would benefit greatly from 
better estimates of euphausiid biomass and vital rates 
so as to properly parameterize the euphausiid 
component of these models.  Improvements to the 
models will result in a tool that will allow us to 
investigate quantitatively the role of euphausiids in 
food chain dynamics. 
 
PICES scientists are also uniquely capable of 
increasing our understanding of euphausiids because 
many oceanographic stations and monitoring lines 
are routinely sampled for hydrography and 
zooplankton.  With some instructions and basic 
supplies, sampling of euphausiids could be easily 
incorporated into these existing monitoring programs 
to allow the collection of living animals at night to 
make measurements of reproduction, molting and 
growth rates. 
 
Studies which focus on this single species, 
Euphausia pacifica, will provide a common starting 
point for international exchanges and partnerships.  
Scientists from PICES member countries have 
information and experience to share, and all would 
benefit from an increased understanding of this 
species.  Moreover, scientific exchanges involving 
research cruises or visits to laboratories will further 
foster an exchange of ideas and will promote long-
term collaborations among students as well as 
established research scientists. 
 
Terms of Reference 
 
1. Assemble lists of existing data (including 
metadata) that contribute to an analysis of the 
comparative ecology of Euphausia pacifica and 
Thysanoessa species.  Identify gaps in our

growth, and incubations of live animals for 
measurement of brood size and molting rates.  
5. Work with modelers to better parameterize 
euphausiids in the NEMURO and other models 
so as to explore their role in coastal and oceanic 
food chains.

1.2 Outcomes of WG 23 beyond the 
Terms of Reference 
 
1. All terms of reference were satisfied, with TOR 
#3 varying slightly from the original proposal.  
Although convening “hands-on” workshops on 
techniques of live euphausiid experimentation 
did not turn out to be feasible, the laboratory led 
by Dr. William (Bill) Peterson (the Peterson lab), 
located at the Hatfield Marine Science Center, 
NOAA-Fisheries, in Newport, Oregon, hosted 
scientists from Chile, China, Japan and 
Germany, and one member from this lab 
participated in several research cruises with 
Korean scientists in the Yellow Sea.  These 
international collaborations included experiments 
on live euphausiids to measure molting and 
growth rates, egg production, feeding 
preferences and rates, and effects of hypoxia.  
Scientists from China and Korea also conducted 
live krill experiments in conjunction with their 
research cruises using the “Euphausiid Live 
Work Protocol” published to the PICES website 
by the Peterson lab in 2005. 
 
2. The Peterson lab hosted and trained a Ph.D. 
student, Xiuning Du, from the Ocean University 
of China in Qingdao. She conducted experiments 
on feeding rates and preferences of Euphausia 
pacifica which comprised a substantial portion 
of her Ph.D. thesis.  Xiuning Du was honored at 
PICES-2010 in Portland, Oregon, with the “Best 
Oral Presentation” award in a BIO-sponsored 
Topic Session.  
 
3. Dr. Peterson spent two weeks in Qingdao, China, 
in December 2011 attending the Ph.D. defense of 
Ms. Xiuning Du and presenting seminars at each 
of the four oceanographic institutes in Qingdao.  
During that time, Dr. Peterson was appointed to 
an Adjunct Professorship at Ocean University of 
China by Prof. Quangxing Lu.   
 
4. Dr. Peterson traveled to Qingdao in May 2012 
for one week to collaborate with WG 23 Co-
Chairman, Prof. Song Sun, on the preparation of 
this report.  
 
5. Working Group member, Tracy Shaw (USA), 
participated in cruises to the Yellow Sea in 
August 2011, April 2012, and April 2013 with 
Dr. Se-Jong Ju’s (WG 23 member from Korea) 
laboratory on the Korean research vessel R/V 
Eardo.  
 
6. The Peterson lab hosted a Chilean Ph.D. student, 
Ramiro Riquelme-Bugueño, during the summer 
of 2011 after his lab in Concepción, Chile, was 
destroyed by a tsunami in February 2010.  This 
collaboration explored the utility of using 
measurements of the euphausiid hepatopancreas 
as an indicator of physiological condition.  
 
7. Dr. Peterson obtained funding for preliminary 
analysis of the population genetics structure of 
Euphausia pacifica.  To compare individuals 
from a variety of geographic locations,  
E. pacifica specimens were obtained from 
WG 23 members in the Oyashio region of Japan 
(Yuji Okazaki), the Yellow Sea (Se-Jong Ju), the 
Bering Sea (Tracy Shaw as part of the BEST 
project), and Oregon (Peterson lab).   
 
8. The successes of WG 23 inspired a proposal to 
establish a working group on zooplankton 
production led by Dr. Toru Kobari (Japan).

2 State of Knowledge of Comparative Ecology of Krill in Coastal 
and Oceanic Waters around the Pacific Rim 
Below we provide excerpts from a proposal to the U.S. National Science Foundation that was funded in 2008.  
Many ideas and topics for discussion within WG 23 were taken in part from this proposal and it is included 
here to provide an overview of the state of our knowledge of Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spp. in the 
North Pacific at the time the proposal was written.   
 
2.1 U.S. GLOBEC Pan-Regional Synthesis — 
Comparative Ecology of Krill in Coastal and Oceanic Waters around  
the Pacific Rim 
 
2.1.1 Introduction and Background 
The U.S. GLOBEC program was initiated to develop 
a broader understanding of climate impacts on 
marine ecosystems.  In this proposal we seek funds 
to synthesize knowledge of North Pacific krill 
through modeling and comparative studies across 
U.S. GLOBEC, Japan GLOBEC, China GLOBEC 
and related study regions.  Within the GLOBEC 
Northeast Pacific (NEP) program, our past research 
addressed the three goals listed below:  
  
 Quantify how physical features in the NEP and 
variability related to climate change impact 
zooplankton biomass, production, distribution, and 
the retention and loss of zooplankton from coastal 
regions, and how these in turn influence the 
distributions of higher trophic levels such as forage 
fish, salmon, and marine birds and mammals; 
 Quantify the impacts of key coastal physical and 
biological processes on controlling juvenile 
salmon growth and survival in the coastal zone of 
the NEP;  
 Compare the impacts of climate variability and 
change (such as ENSO cycles and PDO-related 
regime decadal variability) on similar marine 
animal populations (copepods, euphausiids and 
salmon) across the sub-regions of the NEP.   
Within the goal of understanding climate impacts on 
euphausiids, we will follow two of the three research 
themes outlined in the U.S. GLOBEC Pan Regional 
Synthesis Program Solicitation:  
 
 The response of krill populations at local and 
regional scales to basin- and global-scale change 
in climate forcing;  
 Identify the processes controlling the population 
dynamics and recruitment of krill as a function 
of ecosystem type and ascertain how these 
processes would be affected by climate change, 
to be accomplished through comparing/ 
contrasting population responses from a number 
of different North Pacific ecosystems.   
  
The U.S. GLOBEC NEP program identified krill as a 
target species because they are far less studied than 
copepods, yet they are among the most important 
links in coastal and oceanic food webs, transferring 
energy from primary and secondary producers to 
higher trophic level animals such as salmon, herring, 
sardines, mackerel, Pacific whiting, sablefish, many 
rockfish species, auklets, shearwaters and whales.  
Furthermore, GLOBEC highlighted the need for 
research that focused on krill because many aspects 
of their basic biology and ecology were not well 
understood.  One species of euphausiid, Euphausia 
State of Knowledge  Section 2 
6  PICES Scientific Report No. 43 
pacifica, is of special interest because of its broad 
distribution throughout most of the North Pacific 
Ocean (see Figure 2.1.1).  Across this range, it 
occupies a diversity of habitats, including cool 
upwelling regions off Mexico’s Baja California, 
California, Oregon, Washington and British 
Columbia, the downwelling environment of the Gulf 
of Alaska, shelf-break/slope waters of the Bering 
Sea, oceanic regions across the North Pacific Current 
and sub-arctic Pacific in water north of ~ 40° N, and 
south through the western Pacific from Russia (Sea 
of Okhotsk) to China and Korea (Yellow Sea).  In 
the western Pacific this species inhabits waters where 
temperatures range from sub-arctic (e.g., the Oyashio 
and Bering Sea slope waters) to sub-tropical (the 
Kuroshio, and the East China and Yellow seas). 
There are few invertebrate species that occupy such a 
wide variety of marine ecosystems and such a wide 
range of latitudes.  Thus, we ask, “What are the 
unique characteristics of the life history and ecology 
of this cosmopolitan euphausiid species that allow it 
not only to populate such a wide variety of 
ecosystems, but to become dominant among the 
plankton?”  
 
2.1.2 Synthesis of Observations and 
Experiment 
Because of our krill-centric U.S. GLOBEC-funded 
research, as well as research carried out by biological 
oceanographers in China, Korea, Japan, Russia, 
Canada, and the USA, a rapidly growing amount of 
information has become available on the phenology, 
seasonal cycles of abundance, feeding, reproduction, 
and growth rates of E. pacifica.  Our aim is to 
determine unique aspects of its life history and 
adaptations that permit it not only to exist but to 
prosper in a wide variety of environments across the 
North Pacific.  Comparative studies are needed for 
analysis of the adaptations which allow this species 
to prosper in so many different regions.  Armed with 
this basic information we will be in a better position 
to learn how climate change may affect its 
population dynamics.  
 
The comparisons will also include synthesis of data on 
the less-well studied genus Thysanoessa.  T. spinifera 
is the other dominant Thysanoessa species in the 
California Current which, along with E. pacifica, 
makes up ~ 90% of the biomass of krill in the northern 
California Current (NCC) (Gómez-Gutiérrez et al., 
2005).  T. spinifera is a coastal species in the NCC but 
extends into offshore waters off northern and central 
California (Brinton, 1962), likely because of extensive 
offshore transport of coastal waters in cold mesoscale 
upwelling jets, filaments, and eddies.  This species is 
the dominant euphausiid in the coastal Gulf of Alaska; 
however, in the Bering Sea T. spinifera is replaced by 
T. raschii, T. inermis and T. longipes.  T. raschii and 
T. longipes continue to be dominant in the western 
Pacific where they achieve phenomenal biomass in the 
Sea of Okhotsk (T. raschii in shelf waters and 
T. longipes in deep water offshore).

Section 2  State of Knowledge 
PICES Scientific Report No. 43  7 
We believe that this synthesis proposal to summarize 
the life history and ecology of these krill species has 
a high probability of success because we are 
personally acquainted with most of the krill 
researchers in the North Pacific.  This has come 
about because of our 10 years of involvement in 
PICES (North Pacific Marine Science Organization) 
an international science coordinating body similar to 
ICES in the North Atlantic.  We have been active in 
the Climate Change and Carrying Capacity (CCCC) 
program of PICES (Dr. Harold (Hal) Batchelder has 
been Co-Chairman of CCCC since 2001; Peterson 
chaired the Regional Experiments (REX) Task Team 
of CCCC from 1999–2006, has chaired workshops 
and special sessions on comparative ecology of krill 
at PICES Annual Meetings, and now chairs the 
newly established Working Group 23 on Comparative 
Ecology of Krill in Coastal and Oceanic Waters 
around the Pacific Rim).  Also, a document on the 
PICES website (see http://www.pices.int/projects/ 
Euphasiid/PICES%20Protocols%20COMPLETE.pdf) 
published in 2005 presents “Protocols for measuring 
molting rate and egg production of live euphausiids”. 
 
2.1.3 Synthesis through Modeling 
Another strength of PICES is the ecosystem modeling 
work carried out chiefly by Japanese and U.S. 
scientists.  Many scientists within PICES have 
contributed to the development of NEMURO (North 
Pacific Ecosystem Model for Understanding Regional 
Oceanography) and NEMURO.FISH (NEMURO For 
Including Saury and Herring) and to the application of 
NEMURO, EcoSim and ECOPATH models to the 
study of ecosystem dynamics in the North Pacific. 
PICES scientists would benefit greatly from a 
synthesis of the existing knowledge on E. pacifica and 
other euphausiids, including regional differences, so 
that the euphausiid component of these ecosystem 
models can be properly parameterized.  Improvements 
to the models will result in tools that will allow us to 
investigate quantitatively the role of euphausiids in 
food chain dynamics and the potential impacts of 
climate variability and change on their population 
dynamics.   
 
Modeling of krill can be multifaceted, including  
(1) local biophysically-coupled individual-based, 
Lagrangian models of krill to explore detailed 
interactions of life-history behavior and physiology 
with physical conditions and transports, and 
(2) Eulerian, coupled ecosystem-physical models 
based on NEMURO modified to include euphausiids 
and ROMS (or other physical models).  The former 
type of modeling will continue work begun by Dr. 
Batchelder under a NOAA funded GLOBEC NEP 
synthesis project.  He developed particle tracking 
code that links an Individual-Based Model (IBM) of 
euphausiid bioenergetics and behavior to velocity 
and temperature fields derived from Regional Ocean 
Modeling System (ROMS) simulations.  Physical 
fields are derived from 10 km (NEP) and 3 km 
(CCS) ROMS models, but the population dynamics 
and tracking code was interfaced with other ROMS 
results.  The initial focus was on coupled population 
dynamics-physical simulations in the Northern 
California Current in 2002 for which the best field 
observations were available for comparison.  The 
model, named POPROMS, runs efficiently to advect 
individual organisms through the domain off Oregon 
and Northern California.  We explored the 
interaction of ontogenetically determined diel 
vertical migration and alongshore and zonal water 
circulation, and specifically, we used coupled 
Forward-in-Time-Trajectory (FITT) and Backward-
in-Time-Trajectory (BITT) simulations (Batchelder, 
2006) to examine processes potentially responsible 
for aggregations of euphausiids along the shelf break 
(Ressler et al., 2005).  Simulations were done for 90- 
day periods spanning June, July and August 2000.  
We focused on BITT simulations since what we 
know from plankton surveys are the regions where 
individuals were captured, and what we wish to 
know is where the individuals were at earlier points 
in time and what conditions they experienced.  
Simulations have been completed for scenarios 
where individuals are fixed to certain depths (e.g., 5, 
35, and 95 m), and for simulations in which 
individuals undergo diel vertical migrations of 
various amplitudes (5–>35 m; 5–>95 m; 5–205 m).  
These different amplitude migrations are 
representative of the observed amplitudes of different 
life history stages of E. pacifica, the target organisms 
of this project.  We have also done simulations where 
the amplitude of diel vertical migration is life-stage 
dependent and progression through the life history is 
temperature dependent.   
 
The IBM has focused on including reasonably realistic 
biological dynamics in the POPROMS coupled model.  
To couple biological models with physical models we 
need to describe the vital rate processes of E. pacifica.  
Specifically, we need to parameterize the processes of 
respiration, growth, and development.  To complete 
model closure, we need to parameterize survival and 
State of Knowledge  Section 2 
8  PICES Scientific Report No. 43 
reproduction; however, for the simulations we have 
done to date, we are considering the dynamics from 
egg to first juvenile (e.g., the larval stages of 
E. pacifica), thus, we can ignore reproduction.  
Moreover, since survival rates are quite variable and 
difficult to estimate from observations, we ignore 
mortality effects.  Respiration is parameterized as an 
allometric (individual weight dependent) function that 
includes a fixed cost and a variable cost related to 
consumption.  Growth is allometric and depends 
primarily on food consumption, but also secondarily 
on environmental temperature.  Development rate is 
stage-based and dependent on a nonlinear Belehradek 
function between temperature and stage duration 
(using data reported in Ross (1982) and Feinberg et al. 
(2006)).  Since the earliest life stages—egg, nauplius 
and metanauplius—are non-feeding, we focus on only 
the feeding larval stages (Calyptopis-I to Furcilia-VII).  
We assume a Calyptopis-I of E. pacifica has an initial 
biomass of 3 g C.  Since both respiration and growth 
are food dependent, we need to specify the spatial 
distribution and concentration of food resources 
throughout the model domain, and through time.  The 
physical simulation is not coupled with a lower 
trophic level ecosystem model, so instead we use the 
spatially mapped fields of chlorophyll estimated from 
the spring and summer GLOBEC SeaSoar surveys in 
2002.  We obtained the irregularly spaced SeaSoar 
Chl-a data from the U.S. GLOBEC data server and 
regridded the June and August surveys to a regular 
rectangular grid.  We developed routines to interpolate 
Chl-a to an individual’s location in space from the 
gridded fields.  We assumed a linear interpolation in 
time between the two temporal three-dimensional 
maps of chlorophyll.   
 
Individuals initialized to specific starting locations 
were examined for several specific cases:  (1) fixed 
location, but dynamically evolving temperature and 
prey fields, (2) horizontal advection, with dynamically 
evolving temperature and prey fields, but individuals 
fixed to specific depth horizons (e.g., 5, 35, 85 m, 
etc.), and (3) horizontal advection, with dynamically 
evolving temperature and prey fields, and vertical 
position controlled by stage (e.g., temperature) 
dependent diel vertical migration (DVM).  
Simulations were run from June 1 to August 30.  
Since development and growth are primarily 
dependent on temperature and food concentration, 
respectively, we expected to find that there would be 
locations where growth was fast, but development 
was slow and vice versa.  In upwelling regions, like 
the Oregon region studied here, nearshore, cold 
water regions have high food (slow development, 
fast growth), while offshore warm water regions 
have low food (fast development, slow growth).  
Realistically, the only places where E. pacifica are 
likely to survive are locations where a balance of 
growth and development is achieved.  In Case 1 
(fixed location) simulations, growth is best in 
nearshore regions and poorest in offshore regions.  In 
Case 2 (horizontal, fixed depth) simulations, larval 
euphausiids that start on the shelf on June 1 are 
mostly advected off the shelf within 30 days, with 
the duration of shelf residence also partially 
controlled by the depth at which the individuals are 
fixed.  When individuals are advected off the shelf 
and into generally low-food environments, weight of 
the individual begins to decrease as respiratory losses 
at high temperatures offshore exceed consumptive 
gains.  In general, DVM (Case 3) moves animals 
between shallow depths during the night and deeper 
depths during the day, but this vertical movement 
alone was not sufficient to retain individuals on the 
shelf for more than about 30 days—eventually, most 
individuals ended up offshore, perhaps because of 
the influence of two large eddies off the shelf in the 
domain.  Results of this research were shown at 
several scientific conferences or workshops. 
 
The NEMURO model has become a de facto 
standard ecosystem model for pan-regional 
comparisons in the North Pacific (Batchelder and 
Kashiwai, 2007; Werner et al., 2007).  The base 
lower trophic level NEMURO model has 11 state 
variables: dissolved nitrate, ammonia, and silicate; 
small and large phytoplankton; small, large and 
predatory zooplankton; particulate silica and organic 
nitrogen; and dissolved organic nitrogen (Kishi et al., 
2007a,b).  The base NEMURO model has been 
extended in various ways, depending on the specific 
application and scientific interests, including 
extension to include carbon biochemistry (Fujii et 
al., 2007) and higher trophic levels, in particular to 
describe growth and population dynamics of saury 
and herring (Ito et al., 2007; Megrey et al., 2007b; 
Mukai, et al., 2007; Rose et al., 2007).  NEMURO 
has been used to examine interdecadal variability 
(Aita et al., 2007) and regional differences (Megrey 
et al., 2007a).  It has not been extended to model the 
dynamics and energetics of krill.  That is a goal that 
this synthesis project will pursue, especially as a 
collaboration of Dr. Batchelder and Professor Michio 
Kishi (Tokyo University).  Dr. Kishi, a member of 
PICES WG 23, is one of the originators of the 
NEMURO project and has expressed great interest in 
Section 2  State of Knowledge 
PICES Scientific Report No. 43  9 
working with us to develop a model that can 
represent krill.  This is especially important given the 
recent emphasis on linking NEMURO to various fish 
species, as none of the three zooplankton state 
variables in the present version of NEMURO is 
parameterized in any way like krill would need to be.  
Addition of a krill state variable to NEMURO would 
not only enable prediction of krill dynamics in 
multiple Pacific regions, but would also significantly 
improve representation of processes linking plankton 
production to fish.  
 
2.1.4 Synthesis of U.S. GLOBEC 
Observations:  Copepod and Krill 
Observations off Oregon 
Because of funding from U.S. GLOBEC, NOAA, 
and the Bonneville Power Administration, we have 
accumulated and compiled an extensive long-term 
data set on observations of ocean conditions in 
coastal waters of the Pacific Northwest, and on the 
nutrients, phytoplankton, copepods, krill, ichthyo- 
plankton, sardines, anchovies and juvenile salmon 
that live within these waters. The data have come 
from three time series.   
The Newport Time Series  
The Newport time series was established in 1996 and 
is based on biweekly cruises off Newport, Oregon 
(44°40 N).  Seven stations are currently sampled 
across the continental shelf and slope, at distances of 
1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 nautical miles from shore in 
water depths ranging from 20 to 300 m.  Sampling 
includes a CTD profile (Seabird 19+ with WetStar 
fluorometer and Seabird 43 oxygen sensor), Secchi 
disc depth, a surface sample for nutrients, 
phytoplankton species and chlorophyll, a vertical 
plankton net tow from 100 m to the surface (or from 
5 m off the bottom to the surface in shallower 
waters) with a ½ m diameter 200 µm mesh net, and 
an oblique Bongo tow of the upper 20 m (60 cm 
diameter, 333 µm mesh net).  Since 2001, most of 
these cruises have been at night so as to collect adult 
euphausiids. During the nighttime cruises, euphausiids 
from one side of the Bongo tow are used for live 
animal experiments – we incubate individual krill in 
500 ml or 1 L jars, 30–60 individuals for molting rates 
and up to 20 females for brood size measurements. 
Animals are also returned to the shore laboratory as 
needed for other experiments on developmental 
rates, long-term variations in brood size and inter-
brood periods, and grazing rates.  Data on 
distribution and abundance of copepods, euphausiid 
eggs, larvae, juveniles, and adults from these cruises 
are supplemented by a wealth of historical data on 
hydrography, copepods and euphausiids from 
samples collected in 1969–1973, 1983, 1990–1992 
(copepods and euphausiid eggs and larvae) and 
1963–1967 (Smiles and Pearcy, 1971) and 1971–
1972 (Gómez-Gutiérrez et al. 2005) for juveniles and 
adults.  
The GLOBEC LTOP Time Series   
We also sampled zooplankton and euphausiids at 
approximately 40 stations, ranging from 1–85 
nautical miles from shore and water depths to 
~4000 m along five transects from Newport south in 
February, April, July, September and November as 
part of the GLOBEC Long Term Observation 
Program (LTOP) cruises.  Physical, chemical and 
chlorophyll data are available on line for each station 
(http://ltop.oce.orst.edu/~ctd/index.html).  We also 
sampled zooplankton at approximately 100 stations 
during each of four GLOBEC “mesoscale” cruises 
(MESO) in June and August 2000 and 2002, and 
mapped oceanographic features and zooplankton 
from Newport south to Crescent City, to resolve 
finer-scale and feature-specific copepod and krill 
distribution and abundance associated with eddies, 
meanders, the upwelling jet and upwelling filaments.  
For both the LTOP and MESO cruises, zooplankton 
were sampled with a ½ m diameter (200 µm) net 
towed vertically from 100 m to the surface, and a 
1 m
2
 MOCNESS (333 µm) in depth-stratified tows 
from 500 m to the surface.  
The Bonneville Time Series  
The relevant feature of the Bonneville time series is 
that it includes zooplankton sampling, as described 
above, along transects perpendicular to the coast off 
Oregon (Cascade Head and Cape Meares) and off 
Washington (just south of the mouth of the Columbia 
River, Willapa Bay, Grays Harbor, Queets River and 
La Push).  Thus (as with GLOBEC-LTOP time 
series), we are able to place the Newport time series 
within a spatial context.

2.1.5 Synthesis of Krill Ecology in Coastal 
Waters off Oregon and Washington 
The Newport time series is now of sufficient length 
(16 contiguous years) that when coupled with the 
historical data sets from the 1960s and 1970s, the 
potential impacts of climate change on lower 
trophic level organisms (copepods and euphausiids) 
can be investigated.  Moreover, we can compare our 
seasonal cycles of temperature-chlorophyll-copepods- 
euphausiids to cycles associated with the PDO, 
NPGO and ENSO.  The observation that the PDO 
has cycled at a much higher frequency lately has 
provided us with a natural experiment that will allow 
us to infer mechanisms by which the ecosystem 
change might be related to PDO cycles; some of 
these are discussed for copepods in Hooff and 
Peterson (2006).  Global warming appears to be 
accelerating (IPCC 4
th
 AR), and to investigate how 
warming will impact ecosystems, we will need 
“baselines” (which we now have), based both on 
recent data (1996–present) and on data from the late 
1960s and 1970s. From our recent work on North 
Pacific krill, we have established the following. 
 
Krill biomass peaks in autumn as juvenile stages 
that were born during the July–August phytoplankton 
blooms during the summer upwelling season mature.  
These juveniles become the adults that may spawn as 
early as the following winter (if a February 
phytoplankton bloom occurs), but which will spawn 
during spring and summer blooms associated with 
coastal upwelling.   
 
Stage-specific development times and developmental 
pathways were worked out in laboratory experiments 
in which individuals were raised from eggs and 
maintained in the laboratory for more than two years. 
Detailed information on developmental rates and 
progression through instars resulted from daily 
examination of larvae from egg to juvenile (Feinberg et 
al., 2006).  These known-age animals were also used to 
calibrate the lipofuscin technique for E. pacifica which 
was subsequently used to age wild populations and 
specifically reproductive females (Harvey et al., 2010). 
  
Egg production was further investigated by 
measuring brood size of females collected and 
incubated during cruises (Gómez-Gutiérrez et al., 
2006, 2007).  Potential differences in brood sizes and 
interbrood period (IBP) were investigated for two 
populations of E. pacifica (Oregon and Santa 
Barbara, California) and we found that brood size 
was the same but IBP was one day shorter for the 
Santa Barbara females, 4 vs. 5 days (Feinberg et al., 
2007).  We also compared the brood size of 
E. pacifica females from Japan, Puget Sound and 
Oregon and found that brood sizes were the same 
after correcting for female length (Gómez-Gutiérrez 
et al., 2006).  
  
Growth.  Euphausiids have a strong cohort age 
structure (Smiles and Pearcy, 1971; Brinton, 1976; 
Shaw and Peterson, unpublished data).  We have 
shown from cohort data that growth rates estimated 
from cohort analysis are similar to growth rates 
estimated from incubations of animals collected 
during our cruises (Shaw et al., 2010).  
  
Molting.  Intermolt periods measured from molting 
rate incubations range from 2–20 days with a median 
of 8–10 days (Shaw et al., 2010).  We have also 
staged animals in the molt cycle by examining 
development of setae in the uropods (following 
Dexter, 1981).  We refined this work and have 
shown that one can estimate molting rates from 
preserved samples by staging animals and then using 
the proportion of individuals in pre-molt stage as an 
indicator of the animals that should molt within 
48 hours (Jarvis et al., unpublished report on her 
work carried out as a summer intern).  
 
Feeding.  E. pacifica feeding rates on suspensions of 
Rhodomonas salina were determined at 
concentrations ranging from 50 to 800 µg L
–1
 
(Sremba and Peterson, in prep.
1
).  Animals could 
consume up to 30% of their body weight per day.  
Trials with foods of other sizes showed that they 
could feed on cells as small as 4.5 µm in diameter 
(Isochrysis galbana).  Perhaps this is one adaptation 
that allows them to prosper not only in coastal waters 
but in oligotrophic oceanic waters of the North 
Pacific where cells are typically of this size.  
Analysis of the lipids in wild E. pacifica indicated 
the importance of diatoms in their diet, but a 
comparison to the lipids found in the seston also 
suggested a degree of selective feeding (Ju et al., 
2006). 
  
Cross-shelf distributions. T. spinifera is usually 
found only in shelf waters except in one year, 2002 – 
during that summer females were consistently found 
offshore of the continental shelf.  E. pacifica is most 
abundant at and beyond the shelf break; however, it

is carried into the nearshore upwelling zone with the 
deep upwelled water in the same manner as 
described by Peterson et al. (1979) for Calanus 
marshallae.  Shoreward transport of adults during the 
July–August peak period of upwelling and 
phytoplankton blooms often results in spawning and 
may lead to egg concentrations in excess of 1000 
eggs m
–3
.  Larvae are subsequently found at greater 
distances from shore with ontogeny (Feinberg and 
Peterson, 2003 and unpublished data).  Predation by 
large scyphomedusae may result in high mortality of 
euphausiid eggs in this nearshore zone (Suchman et 
al., 2008).   
 
Diel vertical migration.  DVM was investigated from 
analysis of more than 300 samples from 40 
MOCNESS tows.  In shelf waters, eggs are found 
only near the surface whereas in deep off-shelf 
waters, eggs are usually found at depths > 200 m.  
The first developmental stage to perform DMVs is 
Furcilia III (Vance, unpublished).  This is also the 
stage where all swimming appendages first become 
well developed.  In oceanic waters, adults migrate 
from depths of 200–300 m; in shelf waters it would 
appear that adults reside on or very near the sea floor 
during the day (Ressler et al., 2005) but migrate to 
the surface at night.  
 
Ciliate–euphausiid interactions.  We discovered that 
a ciliate, Gymnodinioides pacifica, can invade the 
bodies of E. pacifica and T. spinifera, consume the 
internal organs and, through rapid cell division, 
cause the adults to rupture (Gómez-Gutiérrez et al., 
2003).  Other species of ciliates consume the organic 
matter that remains inside euphausiid molts (Landers 
et al., 2006), suggesting that the idea of Jerde and 
Lasker (1966) that euphausiid molts are an important 
source of organic matter to the deep sea is unlikely.   
 
2.1.6 Synthesis and Resource Assessment 
and Management 
A final aspect of krill ecology that needs investigation 
is the degree to which euphausiids can be harvested 
commercially.  Nicol and Endo (1999) provide a 
fascinating review of this issue.  E. pacifica is 
currently harvested off the northeast coast of Honshu 
(Japan) and in the Strait of Georgia (Canada).  
Presently, harvest of E. pacifica in the California 
Current is prohibited (http://www.pcouncil.org/wp-
content/uploads/CPS_Am12_Krill_DraftEA.pdf). Given 
the cap on harvesting E. superba in the Antarctic, we 
can expect continued pressure from commercial fishers 
to increase harvest of North Pacific krill populations.  
Our synthesis activities will provide the information 
needed to conduct a formal stock assessment, as 
required for nearly all managed fisheries.   
   
2.1.7 Proposed Pan-Pacific Research 
Through synthesis of our own data as described 
above, and through synthesis activities carried out in 
collaboration with our PICES colleagues, one could 
evaluate and publish on a set of basic research 
questions such as those listed below.  However, not 
all topics could be investigated during the life of 
PICES WG 23 but are presented here as ideas for 
future research: 
 What are the seasonal variations in distribution, 
abundance, growth rates and brood sizes in krill 
populations, and how do they vary regionally 
around the Pacific Rim?  
 Are growth rates and brood sizes related to 
seasonal cycles of primary production?  
 How do populations in the eastern and western 
Pacific respond to ENSO and PDO cycles?  
 How are individuals of the same species 
(Euphausia pacifica) adapted to survive year-
around in the very warm water regions of, for 
example, the Yellow Sea and East China Sea? 
What mechanisms enable individuals to survive 
the long winters in northern regions, e.g., the 
Gulf of Alaska, Sea of Okhotsk and northern 
California Current?  
 What interactions between physical transport and 
life-stage dependent dynamics control the local 
scale distributions of krill and are similar 
interactions important at regional and basin-
scales around the Pacific?  
 
Synthesis which focuses on a single species, 
E. pacifica, provides a common starting point for 
international exchanges and partnerships, largely 
because of this species’ broad distribution.  Scientists 
from PICES member countries have information and 
experience to share, and all would benefit from an 
increased understanding of this species.  Moreover, 
synthesis work proposed here will further foster the 
exchange of ideas and will promote long-term 
collaborations among a culturally diverse set of 
established research scientists as well as graduate 
students and young investigators from the PICES 
member countries.  Thysanoessa spp. will also be 
investigated; however, the biology and ecology of 
State of Knowledge  Section 2 
12  PICES Scientific Report No. 43 
this genus is at present far less well known than for 
E. pacifica; thus, we focus our efforts on the latter 
species.   
Objectives 
Data and metadata   
We have already begun to obtain copies of all 
published research papers on E. pacifica and the 
three Thysanoessa species as an activity under 
PICES WG 23.  For papers, monographs, and theses 
written in languages other than English, the abstracts, 
figure captions and table legends will be translated 
into Japanese (by Dr. Michio Kishi), Chinese (by Dr. 
Hongsheng Bi), and Korean (by Dr. Young-Shil 
Kang).  We are working now to identify Russian 
translators of similar documents.  Research results 
that are deemed critical but which are unavailable in 
peer-reviewed journals (theses, technical reports, 
cruise reports) will be translated fully then scanned 
so that an electronic file is created.  All papers will 
reside on our server as well as on the PICES server 
to assure broad availability to all PICES and krill 
scientists worldwide.  This activity will constitute 
one of our legacy products.   
 
State of our knowledge   
One of our key synthesis activities was devoted to 
distinguishing what is known from what is not 
known.  Thus, published and unpublished work (e.g., 
theses, technical reports, etc.) was identified and 
reviewed by WG 23 to pinpoint gaps in our 
understanding of krill ecology and population 
dynamics.  Working Group members summarized 
what they believe to be known on “key attributes of 
krill life history and ecology” that pertain to 
E. pacifica and Thysanoessa spp. in their local/ 
regional waters.  
    
Collaborative papers   
This activity would include papers written by 
members of WG 23.  Where possible, within national 
constraints, the data discussed in each paper will 
become part of the krill database, and thus a legacy 
product.  In some cases, scientists from several 
member countries would collaborate on joint papers 
whereby each author would analyze his/her own data 
following the same techniques and using a common 
set of illustrations to facilitate comparisons.  A recent 
paper by Heath et al. (2007) is a good example of a 
collaborative paper.  Potential topics which may be 
covered in our Collaborative Papers and Monographs 
include the following: 
 Biomass and seasonal cycles, where possible, of 
abundance of eggs, larvae, juveniles and adults 
of E. pacifica and T. spinifera within the 
GLOBEC–Northeast Pacific Region and in the 
western Pacific.   
 Parameters of population dynamics and variations 
along latitudinal gradients, pan-Pacific: 
o Spawning and recruitment, 
o Age structure, sex ratios, 
o Eggs and larval abundances; survivorship 
and mortality schedules where possible, 
o Growth estimated from cohorts vs. growth 
estimated from  direct measurements of 
growth from molting rate determinations, 
o Brood size and interbrood periods. 
 Comparative life history of E. pacifica in coastal 
waters around the Pacific Rim.  Here, one would 
discuss differences in life history strategies such 
as:  
o over-summering in the Yellow Sea (where 
surface temperatures exceed 25°C);  
o over-wintering off Oregon and in the Gulf of 
Alaska (when there is no primary production 
for at least three months);  
o shrinking as a strategy for reducing metabolic 
rates;  
o spawning seasons in relation to seasonal 
cycles of phytoplankton biomass and 
production;  
o developmental pathways/instars;   
o seasonal cycles of abundance, biomass and 
age structure in relation to seasonal cycles of 
temperature and phytoplankton production. 
 Cross-shelf distributions of eggs/larvae/ juveniles/ 
adults to look at population maintenance 
strategies, cross-shelf transport, and hot spots.  
Data are available from Oregon, Canada and 
Alaska GLOBEC regions, and from monitoring 
programs off Hokkaido (A-Line) and Honshu, 
Japan (PM Line).     
 Vertical distribution and diel vertical migrations 
of developmental stages. 
 The use of one model in several places 
(NEMURO) and different models in different 
places (IBMs); the use of ECOPATH for the 
California Current (developed by Dr. Thomas 
Wainwright at NOAA-Fisheries, Newport).  
 How will climate change affect krill populations 
around the Pacific Rim?  We have a number of 
thoughts on this for euphausiids in the California 
Current, and discuss them later in this proposal.  
Section 2  State of Knowledge 
PICES Scientific Report No. 43  13 
This topic will also be treated by the PICES WG 
23 members since it is likely that large-scale 
climate forcing will express itself regionally in 
fundamentally different ways. 
 
Convene symposia   
Drs. So Kawaguchi (CSIRO, Tasmania) and Bill 
Peterson (NMFS, U.S.) convened a workshop on 
“Krill research: Current status and its future” at the 
4
th
 International Zooplankton Production Symposium 
in Hiroshima, Japan, in May 2007.  This workshop 
accommodated 42 contributions (18 oral presentations 
and 24 posters) and hosted more than 100 scientists, 
and resulted in the preparation of a Special Issue of 
Deep-Sea Research II that was subsequently published 
(Vol. 57, Issues 7–8) in early 2010.  The over-
whelming success of this venture led to 
recommendations by attendees that we convene 
another krill workshop which was planned to coincide 
with the final GLOBEC Open Science Meeting, held 
in June 2009 in Victoria, Canada.  We had hoped to 
convene another krill worskhop at PICES-2011, but it 
was decided that this was too soon after the one in 
Victoria.

2.2 Ongoing Research Relevant to 
WG 23 Activities  
A large number of research programs are in place 
around the Pacific Rim that continue to sample krill 
on a routine basis and/or conduct experiments with 
live krill.  These are summarized briefly here to 
familiarize readers with the breadth of ongoing 
research on North Pacific krill.  PICES scientists, 
especially members of WG 23, are uniquely capable 
of increasing our understanding of euphausiids 
because many oceanographic stations and monitoring 
lines have been, and continue to be, routinely 
sampled for hydrography and zooplankton.  The 
experimental protocol for live euphausiid 
experiments written by the Peterson lab and 
published on the PICES website in 2005 
(http://www.pices.int/projects/Euphasiid/euphasiid.as
px) provide PICES scientists with the information 
they need to collect living animals and measure 
brood sizes, molting, and growth rates as part of their 
existing research programs.

3 Country Reports  
Summary reports from each PICES member country, including past and ongoing sampling programs, are 
presented below. 
 
3.1 Canada
Canadian research on euphausiids not only includes 
many activities in the Northeast Pacific, but projects in 
the Northwest Atlantic, the Gulf of St. Lawrence and 
the St. Lawrence Estuary as well.  In this report we 
detail only the Pacific efforts, but provide brief 
summaries and citations for the east coast work.  On 
both coasts, the primary recent research topics have 
been interannual variability (temporal monitoring), 
spatial distribution (sites and mechanisms for 
formation of local aggregation), and development of 
bioacoustic and net tow sampling methodologies.

Vancouver Island continental shelf/slope 
Interannual variability of euphausiid populations 
along the British Columbia continental margin is 
assessed as part of an ongoing 30+ year overall 
zooplankton monitoring program.  Most sampling 
has been done using vertical net tows with black 
bongo nets fitted with TSK flow meter and 0.23 mm 
mesh).  Depth ranges for the tows are near-bottom to 
surface on the continental shelf, and 250 m to surface 
at deeper offshore locations.  Sampling is done both 
day and night, but abundance and biomass estimates 
from daytime samples include an estimated correction 
factor (~10) for daylight net avoidance by adult and 
late juvenile euphausiids.  Survey timing and number 
varies somewhat from year to year, but usually 
includes two major bio-oceanographic surveys in 
spring (May) and late summer (August–early 
September), plus additional sampling in February, 
June and September (Line P surveys) and mid-
summer and autumn (done as part of juvenile fish 
surveys by DFO (Department of Fisheries and Oceans). 
The two dominant euphausiid taxa in this region (like 
elsewhere along the Pacific coast) are Euphausia 
pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera.  T. inspinata and 
T. longipes are often present and moderately 
abundant in samples from more offshore and 
northerly parts of the region.  We normally report 
and analyze interannual variability of zooplankton as 
time series of log-scale annual biomass anomalies 
calculated relative to estimates of their long-term 
average seasonal cycles.  Interannual variability of 
the euphausiids is high and also strongly coherent 
alongshore.  Previously published local and coast-
wide analyses include Mackas et al. (2001, 2004, and 
2006).  The Vancouver Island data are updated 
annually in DFO “State of the North Pacific” reports 
(e.g., Irvine and Crawford, 2012). Figure 3.1.1 shows 
the most recent of these updates. 
Barkley Sound 
Barkley Sound is a sheltered but relatively deep 
water embayment located on the outer coast of 
Vancouver Island.  Time series sampling targeting 
euphausiids has been done here since 1991 (although 
the future of this program is uncertain due to the 
recent retirement of project leader Ron Tanasichuk). 
Four standard sites have been sampled, nine times 
annually from 1991–1994, and five surveys per year 
(in January, March, June, August and October) 
subsequently.  All sampling was done at night using 
bongo nets (0.33 mm mesh) towed obliquely from 
10 m above the bottom to the surface.  Samples were 
counted with very good size resolution (e.g., Fig. 
3.1.2) and have been used to estimate both growth 
and mortality rates of E. pacifica and T. spinifera 
(Tanasichuk, 1998a,b).

The early years of the Barkley Sound project 
benefited from a collaboration with University of 
Victoria graduate student Patricia Summers which 
produced the first egg-adult rearing of T. spinifera, 
and descriptions/drawings of all its larval stages 
(Summers, 1993).  Recent analyses of the Barkley 
Sound data (e.g., Tanasichuk and Routledge (2011) 
and annual DFO State of the Ocean reports) have 
focused on the importance of euphausiids to juvenile 
and adult fish, and their potential for predicting 
variations in fish recruitment. 
Strait of Georgia 
Despite the ecological importance of the Strait of 
Georgia, and the long history of scientific study by 
university and government researchers, there has 
been no consistent or sustained monitoring program 
for zooplankton (including euphausiids) in this 
region.  However, there have been several high 
quality but shorter duration sampling programs. 
From this earlier work (e.g., Heath 1977; Fulton et 
al., 1982; Romaine et al., 1995, 2002) we knew a lot 
Section 3  Country Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 43  17 
about species composition (strongly dominated by 
E. pacifica, but also including several Thysanoessa 
species), average biomass concentrations (high, but 
even higher in Malaspina Strait and Jervis Inlet, 
which support a small commercial harvest), within- 
Strait spatial distribution, seasonality of growth and 
reproduction, relative magnitudes of the fishery 
harvest vs. average levels and natural seasonal 
changes in population size (the fishery accounts for a 
very small fraction of total mortality).  However, we 
knew relatively little about interannual and decadal 
variability and trends.  In an effort to understand 
long-term changes in the Strait’s food web, DFO 
recently compiled many of the data from earlier net 
tow sampling into a single database which is now 
available for various analyses. Two of these analyses 
(by Li et al. (in press) for nearshore locations around 
the periphery of the Strait, and Mackas et al. (in 
press) for mid-Strait deep water locations) have been 
completed and will soon be published.  Both studies 
found high average biomass of euphausiids during 
most of the 1990s, but also very low population size 
during parts of the last decade (2000s).  Fortunately, 
this decline seems to have ended (and reversed) after 
2007. 
Saanich Inlet and the VENUS undersea 
observatory system 
Many euphausiid species are strong diel vertical 
migrators.  Several of the pioneering studies of the 
extent and environmental cues for their vertical 
migration were done in Saanich Inlet (e.g., Bary et 
al., 1962; Boden and Kampa, 1965). This tradition 
continues.  
 
Extensive arrays of instruments connected to shore by 
a network of data and power cables are a relatively 
new tool and approach for ocean monitoring. 
Although cabled “undersea observatories” typically 
sample only a moderate number of fixed locations, 
they can do so for long time periods and at very high 
temporal resolution.  This makes them especially 
useful for study of intermittent events (such as deep 
water renewal in coastal estuaries) and also for 
detailed study of changes in ~periodic phenomena 
such as the diel vertical migration of euphausiids.  
 
The VENUS network (http://venus.uvic.ca/) includes 
several upward-looking high-frequency echo 
sounders.  The Saanich Inlet node is the oldest of 
these and has provided very detailed records of the 
diel vertical migration of euphausiids (mostly 
E. pacifica) since June 2008 (Fig. 3.1.3).  Sato et al. 
(2013) have analyzed this time series.  They found 
that although timing of upward and downward 
migration approximately tracks seasonal changes in 
the timing of sunrise and sunset, the upward 
migration is slightly but significantly earlier and the 
downward migration later when daylight duration is 
longer. 
East coast of Canada 
A broad net-tow-based monitoring of zooplankton 
has been in place since 1999 in various east coast 
regions of Canada (part of the DFO Atlantic Zonal 
Monitoring Program, http://www.meds-sdmm.dfo-
mpo.gc.ca/isdm-gdsi/azmp-pmza/index-eng.html). This 
includes euphausiids, but does not specifically target 
them in terms of sampling methodologies.  However, 
there has been additional research using acoustic and 
optical sampling methods, especially at locations in 
the St. Lawrence Estuary (where euphausiid 
abundance and distribution are of great interest and 
importance to the growing industry of whale 
watching tourism; e.g., Simard and Lavoie, 1999; 
Cotté and Simard, 2005) and in deep basins on the 
Nova Scotia shelf (where populations of Thysanoessa 
inermis and Meganyctiphanes norvegica provide 
forage for resident fish, e.g., Herman et al., 1993; 
Cochrane et al., 2000).   
 
3.1.2 Bioacoustic Sampling and Analysis  
Because euphausiid spatial distributions are 
extremely patchy (see next section), bioacoustics 
sampling is often very useful to resolve and 
understand their spatial pattern.  At various times 
during the past 30 years, there has been considerable 
Canadian developmental work on high frequency 
acoustic sampling and data analysis methods. For the 
Atlantic coast of Canada, references in the previous 
section are a good starting point, but see also Simard 
and Sourriseau (2009) for an examination of diel 
changes in target strength due to changes in body 
orientation and how these are affected by strobe-
lights mounted on the nets used to obtain sea-truth 
samples.  On the west coast, recent work includes a 
cross-taxa comparison of euphausiid, fish, and 
siphonophore target strengths at different acoustic 
frequencies (Trevorrow et al., 2005) and development 
of geostatistical methods for analysis of acoustic data 
(Romaine et al., 1995, 2002).

Inlet (from Sato et al., 2013). 
  
3.1.3 Spatial Distribution and Krill 
Aggregation Mechanisms 
Research on spatial aggregation (where, when and 
why euphausiids form dense patches) has been the 
dominant theme of much recent Canadian euphausiid 
research. This work was pioneered on both Canadian 
coasts by Yvan Simard (e.g., Simard et al., 1986; 
Simard and Mackas, 1989), and he continues to be 
very active in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and St. 
Lawrence Estuary (e.g., Simard and Lavoie, 1999). 
Recent west coast work by others on three inter-
related topics is summarized below. 
Highest abundance along the continental shelf 
break and margins of banks or other steep slopes 
We now have conclusive evidence from a wide 
variety of locations (e.g., Mackas et al., 1997; 
Romaine et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2003) that 
euphausiids and their predators aggregate along 
bathymetric “edges”.  These include the continental 
shelf break, the sides of submarine canyons, the 
margins of mid-shelf banks and basins, and the sides 
and sills of fjords.  At these locations, euphausiid 
aggregations reform daily and rather quickly at the 
daytime depth of the euphausiid scattering layer, so 
almost certainly involve a “fast” behavioral 
mechanism rather than being primarily linked to 
“slow” population growth.  While it is also likely that 
krill aggregation behavior has evolved to place 
aggregations (on average) in locations where growth 
is likely to be good, many of the sites of dense 
aggregations are prime feeding grounds for finfish, 
baleen whales, and other euphausiid predators, 
leading sometimes to elevated local mortality rates. 
 
We also now know that the densest subsurface 
aggregations occur where and when advective 
transport at scattering layer depth is strongly 
convergent toward a sloping seabed (Fig. 3.1.4).  
Depending on location, this convergence can be 
driven by wind, meandering alongshore currents, or 
tides. 
Spatial separation of adult and larval euphausiid 
life stages 
Many years ago, Brinton and Wylie (1976) made the 
interesting observation that abundance of adult and 
larval life stages of euphausiids is negatively 
correlated in CalCOFI samples.  At first glance, this 
seems odd given that much of the total adult 
(spawning) population is at any given time within a 
Section 3  Country Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 43  19 
fairly local aggregation, and adult aggregations at 
specific locations are often either persistent or 
recurrent.  But in evolutionary terms such a 
relationship is also adaptive because it reduces risk 
of cannibalism of juveniles by adults.  Lu et al. 
(2003) explored this question in the Vancouver 
Island continental margin environment and found 
that adults and juveniles are indeed often separated in 
a cross-shore direction by small, but ecologically 
significant, distances (order 10 km) (Fig. 3.1.5).  
 
 
 
Fig. 3.1.4 Aggregation of euphausiids at bathymetric edges. Left panel (from Mackas et al., 1997) compares local 
concentrations around the margin of Nitinat Canyon with local rate of convergence of horizontal flow.  Right panel 
(courtesy M. Benfield) shows aggregation on the tidal-upstream side of the Knight Inlet sill, where flow direction and 
aggregation site reverse at tidal periodicity.

Fig 3.1.6 Observations (left) and model output (right) of intensification plus downward displacement of the euphausiid 
scattering layer (from Ianson et al., 2011).  Tidal flow is from left to right.  To reproduce the downward displacement, 
euphausiids must swim downward when they encounter shear/turbulence in the bottom boundary layer. 
 
Lu et al. (2003) concluded that the primary 
mechanism responsible for this separation of larvae 
and adults is the difference in daily cross-shore 
Ekman transport between larval stages that always 
inhabit the surface layer vs. adults that inhabit a deep 
(and counter-flow) layer for many hours of each day. 
Depending on local upwelling conditions (the data 
shown in Figure 3.1.5 are from downwelling 
conditions), larvae are displaced either seaward or 
shoreward from their parents.  
Mechanism of aggregation by late juvenile and 
adult euphausiids 
This is and remains a topic of active debate and 
enquiry.  Simard and his colleagues interpret from 
observation in the St. Lawrence Estuary that the 
primary causal mechanism is light–depth maintenance 
against vertical displacement by tidal (or other) 
vertical displacements.  However, our recent data 
from Knight Inlet (Fig. 3.1.4 and Ianson et al., 2011) 
strongly support an additional or alternative 
mechanism.  The key observation (left panel in 
Fig. 3.1.6) is that the core aggregation gets deeper by 
about 10 m as it approaches the bathymetric barrier. 
 
Model experiments (Ianson et al., 2011) show this 
downward movement is reproduced only if the 
euphausiids swim downward across light and depth 
contours.  It does not happen if they are drifting 
passively with the tidal flow (in which case they are 
carried upward by the convergent flow) or if they are 
maintaining a preferred light depth (in which case the 
scattering layer intensifies less strongly and 
maintains a constant depth).

3.2 Japan
There are research projects that include krill studies 
at the following institutions in Japan:  Tohoku 
National Fisheries Research Institute (2006–2011), 
National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries, 
The Institute of Cetacean Research, Tohoku 
University, and Hokkaido University.  Recent 
research has taken place predominantly in the 
subarctic region of the western North Pacific.  Target 
species of euphausiids are Euphausia pacifica and 
Thysanoessa spp.  Research interests focus mainly on 
distribution and abundance.  Projects are generally 
conducted by small groups or individuals at each 
institute as a component of a larger research 
program.   
 
 
3.2.1 The ODATE Collection 
The ODATE collection comprises more than 20,000 
zooplankton samples (formalin preserved) which are 
archived at the Tohoku National Fisheries Research 
Institute, Fisheries Research Agency Japan.  These 
samples have been collected by public fisheries 
institutes in the northeastern region of Japan since 
1950 using a NORPAC net (0–150 m, 0.33 mm 
mesh).  These samples were originally collected for 
routine monitoring of prey abundance for fisheries 
studies but they are in good condition and can be 
used for zooplankton species identification.  The 
samples could be used for long-term quantitative 
analysis of the abundance and distribution of 
euphausiid eggs and larvae. 
   
 
3.2.2 Distribution 
There are two major current systems around Japan, 
the Oyashio Current and the Kuroshio Current.  The 
area between these two currents in the NW Pacific 
Ocean is known as the mixed water region or the 
Kuroshio-Oyashio (K-O) transition (Fig. 3.2.1).  
There are 38 species of euphausiids reported to occur 
in Japanese waters, including both subtropical and 
subarctic species.  There are 26 species of 
euphausiids that occur in the coastal area of 
northeastern Japan (Taki, 2007).  E. pacifica is the 
most dominant species in this region, and 
Thysanoessa inspinata has the second highest 
abundance.  Sampling along the A-line (five fixed 
stations in the Oyashio and mixed water region) in 
March, May, July and November, yielded 21 species 
of euphausiids (Okazaki, unpub. data) of which 
E. pacifica was the dominant taxon. Species diversity 
is higher toward southern stations.  Results from 
cluster analysis suggested three species assemblages 
in this region: assemblages I, IIa, and IIb. 
Assemblage I occurred in the Oyashio region where 
the temperature at 100 m depth wa s	5°C or warmer.

It consisted of five species – E. pacifica, Thysanoessa 
inspinata, Thysanoessa longipes, Thysanoessa 
inermis, and Tessarabrachion oculatum,  E. pacifica 
was the dominant species (~88%), followed by 
T. inspinata (~10%).  Assemblage IIa occurred year-
round in the mixed water region where the 
temperature at 100 m depth was less than 5°C.  There 
were nine species in this assemblage – E. recurva, 
Nematoscelis microps, E. mutica, E. gibboides, 
E. tenera, E. hemigibba, Stylocheiron longicorne, 
E. similis, and Nematobrachion boopis. Three species, 
E. recurva, Nematoscelis microps, and E. mutica, 
comprised over 75% of this assemblage.  Assemblage 
IIb occurred in the mixed water region in summer and 
autumn.  It consisted of six species – Stylocheiron 
affine, S. carinatum, S. elongatum, Thysanopoda 
tricuspidata, Thysanopoda obtusifrons, and Euphausia 
brevis.  The three Stylocheiron species accounted for 
about 60% of this assemblage. 
 
3.2.3 Seasonal Cycles 
Egg and larval stages were found throughout the year 
but were especially abundant in spring (April to 
May).  Adults occurred throughout the year and were 
particularly abundant in the Oyashio region from late 
summer through autumn (August to October).  
Abundance in the Oyashio was higher than in the 
mixed water region (Taki, 2004, 2006a,b).  
Individual E. pacifica and T. inspinata in the 
Oyashio region overwinter as juveniles, then mature, 
reproduce, and complete their life cycle in the 
following year (Kim et al., 2009). 
 
Abundance was determined using a variety of 
different techniques.  On the krill fishing grounds, 
oblique tows using a 1.3 m diameter ring net 
obtained a maximum abundance of 100 ind. m
–3 
during the period from January to April.  In other 
coastal areas of Japan, vertical tows using a 45 cm 
diameter NORPAC net found abundances of 0.2~0.5 
ind. m
–3
, with a maximum of 1 ind. m
–3
 year-round.  
In the subarctic domain (defined as areas where the 
temperature at 100 m depth is below 4 null ), trawl tows 
in the summer found a mean abundance of 0.09 ind. 
m
–3
, with a maximum of 0.62 ind. m
–3
.  Bongo net 
samples collected year-round on the A-Line in the 
Oyashio region found a mean of 0.29 ind. m
–3
 with a 
maximum of 2.4 ind. m
–3
. Although krill abundances 
are known to be highly variable, it is likely that some 
of these differences may be attributed to differences 
in types of sampling gear. 
 
3.2.4 Spawning  
Egg and larval stages occurred throughout the year, 
but were especially abundant in spring (April to 
May).  Reproductive activity occurs in close 
association with the timing of the spring bloom in 
both the Oyashio region and the K-O transition 
regions (Kim et al., 2010a). 
 
Egg production experiments in the Oyashio region 
were conducted from March to July in 2007.  No 
gravid females were found in March; however, they 
were present from April to July suggesting that 
E. pacifica spawning occurs from April to July with 
the peak period in April to May.  E. pacifica 
spawning took place at low temperatures (<5°C).  A 
total of n = 59 females spawned during these 
experiments (Fig. 3.2.2).  The size range (total 
length, TL) of females in these experiments was 13–
22 mm with most females in the 17–21 mm range, 
probably reflecting the size range of most mature 
females in the field.  Individual brood sizes ranged 
from 4–183 eggs female
–1 
with most brood sizes 5–
120 eggs female
–1
.  There was no relationship 
between TL and brood size.  A previous study on 
long-term fecundity of E. pacifica females found that 
smaller females produced smaller broods and larger 
females produced a wide range of brood sizes 
(Feinberg et al., 2007).  The variability in the results 
from Japan suggests that individual variability 
among E. pacifica females in the Oyashio region is 
similar to that of E. pacifica in other geographical 
areas (Feinberg et al., 2007, 2013).   
 
Combining the brood size data by experiment date 
suggests a decreasing trend in brood sizes from late 
April to June (Fig. 3.2.3).  The experiment on April 
25 contained 19 krill that spawned, with brood sizes 
of 8–183 eggs female
–1
 and included n = 6 broods of 
more than 120 eggs.  Because of varying numbers of 
spawning females in other experiments, the data are 
insufficient to validate this trend.  It will be an 
interesting topic to investigate in future studies.

3.2.5 Species Composition and Growth in 
the Oyashio 
The abundance and population structure of 
E. pacifica and T. inspinata were investigated during 
the period March 9 to April 29, 2007 at a single 
station in the Oyashio region as part of the Ph.D. 
research of Hye Soon Kim.  Water temperatures and 
chlorophyll a concentrations varied from 1.1 to 
6.1°C and from 0.02 to 6.3 mg m
−3
, respectively, 
primarily reflecting the effects of varying mixtures of 
the water masses prevailing in this region.  The 
abundance of euphausiids collected by oblique hauls 
with Bongo nets (0–200 m) at night ranged from 41 
to 1040 individuals m
−2
 for E. pacifica and from 50 
to 186 individuals m
−2
 for T. inspinata.  Variations in 
the abundance of E. pacifica were related to water 
temperature and chlorophyll a, while abundance of 
T. inspinata varied only with temperature.  Adults 
were the major component of both euphausiid stocks 
(>90% of the total).  Modal size analysis revealed 
that a group comprising larger euphausiids of both 
species (E. pacifica 14–18 mm TL, T. inspinata 16–
18 mm TL) occurred throughout the study period, 
often accompanied by one discrete group of smaller 
individuals (<11 mm TL for both euphausiid 
species), suggesting that the same euphausiid 
population is distributed throughout the heterogeneous 
water masses.  Adult males were significantly 
smaller than adult females for T. inspinata, but this 
was not the case for E. pacifica.  By tracking the 
progressive increase in the mean sizes of the larger 
size groups, growth rates were estimated to be 
0.082 mm day
−1
 for E. pacifica and 0.022 mm day
−1
 
Country Reports  Section 3 
24  PICES Scientific Report No. 43 
for T. inspinata.  Full details are available in Kim et 
al. (2010a,b).  
 
Growth of E. pacifica off northeastern Japan was 
estimated from size frequency distributions (Taki, 
2004).  This analysis showed that new cohorts 
appeared in April and grew slowly and steadily until 
the following March, then grew rapidly from March 
to June.  This period of rapid growth in the spring is 
probably associated with the timing of the spring 
bloom.  Results of the size frequency analysis 
indicate that the life span of E. pacifica in this region 
is 24 months for males and 28 months for females 
(Taki, 2004).   
 
3.2.6 Lipid Analysis 
As reported for E. pacifica by Saito et al. (2002), 
phospholipids (PL, 44.1–81.2%) such as phospha- 
tidylethanolamine (PE, mean ± standard error, 26.1 ± 
2.1%) and phosphatidylcholine (PC, 29.0 ± 2.3%) 
were found to be the dominant lipids. Compared to 
many other marine organisms, the level of PL was 
markedly high.  The major fatty acids in the 
triacylglycerol (TAG) of E. pacifica were saturated 
fatty acids (SFA, 14:0 and 16:0), monounsaturated 
fatty acids (MUFA, 16:1 and 18:1), and 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 18:4 n −3 and 
20:5 n −3, icosapentaenoic acid: EPA). The only fatty 
acids found in the tissue PL were SFA (16:0), MUFA 
(18:1), and PUFA (20:4 n −6, arachidonic acid: AA, 
EPA, and 22:6 n −3, docosahexaenoic acids: DHA). 
The comparatively high levels of 14:0, 16:0, 16:1 
n −7, 16:2 n −4, 16:4 n −1, 18:1 n −7, 18:1 n −9, 18:4 
n −3, and EPA in the TAG may be affected by the 
lipid composition of phytoplankton prey, such as 
diatoms which generally contain high amounts of 
these fatty acids. The levels of short chain 14:0, 16:1 
n −7, 16:2 n −4, 16:4 n −1, 18:1 n −9, and 18:4 n −3 
decreased in PL, while AA, EPA, and DHA 
increased.  In particular, the levels of n −3 PUFA in 
PL were markedly high in all specimens.  The mean 
proportion of EPA plus DHA accounted for more 
than 45% (55.0% in PE and 47.7% in PC) of the total 
fatty acids.  These results suggest that E. pacifica, 
which contains markedly high levels of EPA and 
DHA, may biosynthesize these PUFA by carbon 
chain elongation and desaturation or selectively 
accumulate n −3 PUFA.  In addition, their lipids may 
be an important source of n −3 PUFA for higher 
marine animals such as pelagic marine fishes 
(sardines, anchovies, and other small fishes) which 
mainly prey on these euphausiids.  Marine fish 
accumulate high levels of n −3 PUFA because they 
are unable to synthesize DHA. 
 
Lipids in krill sampled in Funka Bay (Hokkaido) in 
spring, summer, and winter in three consecutive 
years, 2000–2002 were analyzed by Kusumoto et al. 
(2004).  They found that lipid content of the 
E. pacifica samples ranged from 5.1 to 11.6% on the 
basis of dry weight.  Major lipid classes in samples 
from 2002 were triacylglycerols (TAG) (3.4–27.3%), 
free fatty acids (FFA) (6.9–22.2%), sterols (5.4–
12.9%), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) (3.4–
17.5%), and phosphatidylcholines (PC) (36.2–
53.8%).  All of the samples analyzed for fatty acids 
were high in 16:0 (19.0–24.5% of total fatty acids), 
18:1 n–9 (7.5–10.0%), 18:1 n–7 (6.3–8.1%), 20:5 n–
3 (IPA) (15.3–24.7%), and 22:6 n–3 (DHA) (8.4–
20.7%).  The lipids of E. pacifica were found to be 
generally rich in PC and in IPA and DHA.  Lipid 
content and proportion of TAG were higher in the 
spring samples than in the summer samples.  The 
summer samples had higher concentrations of DHA 
in total fatty acids. 
 
3.2.7 Genetics Studies 
Analysis of regional gene structure (18S rDNA and 
16S rRNA) of E. pacifica across the west–east 
subarctic Pacific showed only very small differences 
(Takahashi et al., 2006).  This finding suggests that 
E. pacifica throughout the subarctic Pacific could be 
considered the same population.  If the lack of 
regional difference of gene structure in E. pacifica 
across the west–east Pacific is true and the 
euphausiids throughout this large geographic area 
constitute a single population, the life cycle and 
population dynamics of E. pacifica need to be 
considered on a large scale (i.e., subarctic North 
Pacific).

3.3 People’s Republic of China
An active and ongoing research program on the 
ecology of krill in the Yellow Sea is being 
undertaken primarily by scientists from the Institute 
of Oceanology Chinese Academy of Sciences – Key 
Laboratory of Marine Ecology and Environmental 
Sciences, based in Qingdao, China, and led by Prof. 
Song Sun.  Regular sampling of krill on a quarterly-
bimonthly basis was initiated in 2006 and these 
efforts continue.  Sampling for krill is carried out 
with 80 cm ring nets with 500 µm mesh hauled 
vertically from near the sea floor to the surface (for 
juveniles and adults), with Henson egg nets and with 
large-volume whole water samplers for eggs and 
larvae of euphausiids, copepods, and other 
planktonic organisms.  On some cruises, experiments 
are conducted on live krill for estimates of egg 
production, grazing, and metabolic rates.   
 
3.3.1 Distribution and Seasonal Variability  
Euphausia pacifica is the dominant species of 
euphausiid in the Yellow Sea.  Three other species, 
Pseudeuphausia sinica, P. latifrons and E. nana, are 
abundant at times.  The spatial distribution and 
population structure of E. pacifica in the Yellow Sea 
were studied from April 2006 through August 2007 
(Sun et al. 2011, Liu et al. submitted) during eight 
cruises.  E. pacifica is found throughout the Yellow 
Sea but its spatial distribution is controlled primarily 
by seawater temperature, with the adults 
preferentially inhabiting cold water.  E. pacifica 
occurred throughout most of the study area in spring 
and winter.  However, when sea surface temperatures 
were > 20°C in summer and autumn months,  
E. pacifica was mainly located in the Yellow Sea 
Bottom Cold Water (YSBCW) where the 
temperature below the thermocline was 8–10°C. 
   
3.3.2 Diel Vertical Distribution 
The vertical distribution and diel vertical migration 
of krill eggs and larvae were studied by Liu and Sun 
(2010) in a paper published in the special issue on 
krill biology and ecology in Deep-Sea Research Part 
II (Vol. 57, Issues 7–8).  They studied stage-specific 
differences in the diel vertical distribution and 
migration of E. pacifica at a single station (E2, 70 m 
depth) in the southern Yellow Sea by sampling with 
a conical closing net from five discrete strata every 
three hours over a 24-h time period on May 2–3, 
2001. Environmental data were collected 
simultaneously with net sampling.  Results showed 
that eggs contributed a large proportion of the 
numerical abundance of the E. pacifica population 
throughout the investigation.  They were mainly 
distributed below 20 m depth and concentrated in the 
30–50 m strata throughout the day and night. 
Nauplius stage I (NI) was distributed below 10 m, 
and seldom occurred in the upper 10 m. Nauplius 
stage II (NII) and Metanauplius stage (MN) extended 
their distribution to nearly the whole water column; 
however, the MN resided somewhat shallower than 
NII.  The majority of calyptopis stages I to III (CI to 
CIII ) and early furcilia stages I to III (FI to FIII) 
were restricted to the upper 30 m throughout the day. 
The weighted mean depth tended to increase as the 
stage progressed from stage FI onward.  Calyptopis 
stages showed weak or moderate diel vertical 
migration (DVM), and the onset of an obvious DVM 
took place at the FII stage.  The amplitude of the 
DVM varied with developmental stages.  Stages after 
FIV were often absent from samples during the 
investigation, but from the limited available data, 
DVM occurred in furcilia stages FIV–VI and female 
adults.  Male adults showed a somewhat different 
migration behavior.  In summary, an ontogenetic 
migration pattern is obvious from this high-
frequency sampling: spawning took place at 20–50 m 
depth, hatched nauplii sank a little, metanauplii 
began moving toward the surface, and calyptopis 
larvae reached the uppermost layer.  Furcilia larvae 
began DVM and deepened their daytime residence 
depth with age.  The vertical distribution of 
E. pacifica seemed to relate to temperature and 
chlorophyll a. 
 
3.3.3 Abundance  
The seasonal cycle of abundance was investigated 
during cruises in 2006 and 2007.  These efforts 
showed that juveniles and adults are widely 
distributed throughout the Yellow Sea in spring and 
winter when sea surface temperatures are 8–16°C.  
Country Reports  Section 3 
26  PICES Scientific Report No. 43 
Adults were found only in the YSBCW in summer 
and autumn.  Average abundances of juveniles and 
adults by season are shown in Table 3.3.1.  The one 
very high value of 243.8 individuals m
–3
 in autumn 
was at a single station.  If this station were excluded, 
the range would be 0 to 18.7 individuals m
–3
.  These 
data are also shown in Fig. 3.3.1 as monthly values 
of abundance and biomass. 
 
3.3.4 Spawning  
From the same 2006 and 2007 cruises, eggs were 
sampled for the purpose of establishing the spawning
season.  Average egg abundances over the sampling 
region in March, April and May were 7.7, 57.6 and 
32.5 eggs m
–3
, respectively. The maximum 
abundance was in May 2007 (441.8 eggs m
–3
). 
During June and August 2007, eggs were found at a 
few stations but with abundances of <3 eggs m
–3
. 
Eggs were occasionally found in October and 
December suggesting that some egg production 
could occur nearly year-around, but that the main 
spawning season was clearly during the spring, in 
March–May.  This is the same time of the year when 
chlorophyll concentrations are highest (Sun et al., 2011).

3.3.5 Recruitment 
Larval stages were most abundant in spring, making 
up about 65% of the abundance of all stages (eggs, 
larvae, juveniles and adults) combined.  Average 
abundance of larvae in spring was 40 m
–3
 whereas 
during summer, autumn and winter, numbers were 
on average from 0.3 to 1.0 m
–3
.  This suggests that, 
as with the abundance of eggs, spawning and 
recruitment are strongest in spring but minor 
amounts of spawning and recruitment may be 
occurring nearly year-round. 
3.3.6 Life History Parameters 
Developmental rates 
   
Data on developmental rates for E. pacifica from the 
Yellow Sea are limited to a few measurements made 
on the non-feeding larval states (nauplius 1 and 2, 
metanauplius and calyptopis 1) at three temperatures 
(Fig. 3.3.2).  Development was clearly related to 
temperature, with time from hatching to C1 at 4°C of 
about 16 days, compared to about 5 days at 12°C and 
15°C.  This compares well to Feinberg et al. (2006) 
who reported a median development time to C1 of 
6.4 days at 10.5°C.  
 
Egg production and brood sizes 
 
To estimate egg production, on-board incubations of 
adult female Euphausia pacifica were conducted 
during eight cruises in 2006 and 2007 (Sun et al., 
2011).  A total of 181 females were incubated.  
Results of these experiments showed that the brood 
sizes were highest in the spring, averaging 203.9 
eggs female
–1 
d
–1
 in April (2007) and 221.2 eggs 
female
–1 
d
–1
 in May (2007).  Lower values were 
found in March and June (71.3 and 25.3 eggs  
female
–1 
d
–1
, respectively). Maximum brood sizes 
were observed in May 2007, ranging from 69 to 485 
eggs female
–1 
d
–1
.  No spawning was noted during 
cruises in August, September, or December.  This 
suggests that the main spawning season extends 
throughout the spring and apparently ends in late 
June.  As noted above in the section on spawning 
deduced from sampling of eggs in the sea, the 
spawning season can occur nearly year-round (based 
on the presence of eggs in the water column) but 
since no mature females were found in the field 
sampling, it appears that spawning is sporadic 
outside of the main spawning season.   
 
Feeding and metabolism 
 
Some euphausiid feeding studies have been 
conducted by Zhencheng Tao (Key Laboratory of 
Marine Ecology and Environmental Science, 
Institute of Oceanology – Chinese Academy of 
Sciences, Qingdao), using the disappearance of 
chlorophyll method, for both total chlorophyll and 
size fractions.  Dr. Tao has also measured respiration 
rates and ammonia excretion rates of krill in 
incubations.  The data from these studies are still 
being analyzed at the time of this report and will be 
published at a later date.

3.4 Republic of Korea
Ongoing euphausiid research is carried out as part of 
a project at the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and 
Technology (KIOST, formerly KORDI).  The project 
is entitled ‘The study on the impact of the Yellow 
Sea Cold Water Mass to the ecosystem (2009–2016)’ 
(KIOST grant PE99165).  The Yellow Sea bottom 
cold water mass (YSBCM: ≤ 10°C) persists in the 
deep central region of the Yellow Sea during the 
summer when the surface temperature increases to 
> 25°C.  It may provide an over-summering refuge 
for cold water organisms (such as Calanus sinicus, 
and Euphausia pacifica) which enables them to 
maintain their populations in the Yellow Sea. Studies 
of the distribution, physiology, and feeding ecology 
of E. pacifica are included as part of this program.  
There are two annual cruises for this project: spring 
(April) and summer (August).  Euphausiids are 
collected using either a conical net (mouth diameter: 
1.5 m; mesh size: 333 or 417 μm) or mid-water trawl 
(square mouth: 2 m
2
; mesh size: 417 μm).  Sampling 
is conducted both day and night.  Acoustics data are 
collected using a 200 kHz split-beam transducer 
(BioSonics, USA).  Samples are collected to 
determine euphausiid abundance and biomass as well 
as for analysis of lipid composition.  When possible, 
live euphausiid experiments are conducted during 
these cruises to measure molting rate and egg 
production (brood size) of E. pacifica using the 
protocol developed by the Peterson lab (available on 
the  PICES  website  at  http://www.pices.int/projects/
Euphasiid/euphasiid.aspx).   
 
3.4.1 Distribution 
Adult krill are found predominantly in the middle of 
the Yellow Sea, which is the deepest part. However, 
they may occur just about everywhere in the Yellow 
Sea with the exception of the areas nearest to the 
coast.  The vast majority of spawning occurs in the 
spring (April) but some eggs are found in the 
summer, especially in the coastal region of the 
southern part of the Yellow Sea.  In general, eggs 
and adults are the dominant life stages in spring and 
juveniles and small adults are dominant in summer 
and fall.  Results from the spring and summer of 
2010 and 2011 show how this pattern may vary 
between years (Fig. 3.4.1).  In the spring of 2010, 
eggs and early stage larvae (nauplii) were dominant 
at all stations, with adults present in low numbers.   
In the spring of 2011, furcilia, juveniles, and adults 
(including gravid females ≥ 2 cm total length (TL)) 
were abundant and engaged in active diel vertical 
migration (DVM) behavior.  In the summer of 2010, 
the abundance of later-stage larvae (calyptopis and 
furcilia) increased, with some eggs and adults still 
present in the coastal region.  Although they 
remained in the YSBCM, the krill maintained active 
DVM (from the bottom to below the thermocline), 
avoiding the high temperature water mass. In 
contrast, in the summer of 2011 the only euphausiids 
sampled were a few juveniles in the most southern 
part of the survey area (Fig. 3.4.1, bottom right 
panel).  They did not show the same DVM pattern as 
observed in 2010.  This may be a consequence of the 
episodic disturbance caused when Typhoon Muifa 
passed through the survey area just a couple of days 
before the research cruise. 
 
3.4.2 Diel Vertical Migration  
The Yellow Sea is a semi-enclosed marginal sea 
(mean depth = 50 m) and the waters are very warm 
in summer and fall.  Adult krill are believed to take 
refuge from the warm temperatures in the colder 
bottom waters in the deepest parts of the Yellow Sea.  
Vertical movements of sound backscattering layers 
were followed for 24 hours with continuous acoustic 
surveys (targeting zooplankton) in spring and 
summer.  Composition of the layers was confirmed 
with depth-targeted net sampling data.  In spring, 
active DVM of E. pacifica was observed throughout 
the entire water column (Fig. 3.4.2, upper panel).  In 
summer, DVM still occurred but was limited to the 
YSBCM, with the zooplankton avoiding the high 
temperature water mass (Fig. 3.4.2, lower panel).  In 
the spring, the whole water column was well mixed 
and the Chl-a max was located in the surface layer. 
One backscattering layer was observed in the spring 
acoustic survey and it followed a typical diel vertical 
migration pattern.  In summer, the water column was 
well stratified (well developed YSBCM) and the 
Chl-a max was located just below the thermocline.  
Acoustic surveys showed two backscattering layers 
during this survey.  The first was found in the surface 
Section 3  Country Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 43  29 
mixed layer and appeared only at night.  It comprised 
mainly fish larvae and small copepods.  The second 
was located within the YSBCM and comprised 
mainly copepods and E. pacifica.  This layer still 
showed a diel vertical migration pattern but it took 
place entirely within the YSBCM.

the spring and highly stratified in the summer.   
 
3.4.3 Lipid Analysis 
Lipids (including lipid class) and dietary lipid 
biomarkers (fatty acids and sterols) of E. pacifica 
collected from the Yellow Sea were analyzed to 
understand their energetics and dietary strategy.  
Lipid content was about 10% of dry weight and was 
similar between seasons (Fig. 3.4.3).  Lipids serve as 
fuel for embryonic development and growth and also 
offset the potential for larvae to starve after hatching 
(Lee et al., 2006).  Information on lipid storage and 
distribution in krill could provide insight into 
nutritional conditions as well as serve as an index of 
reproductive potential. E. pacifica from the Oregon 
and Washington coasts (OR/WA) allocate a 
significant amount of lipids to their eggs (4.5 g  
egg
–1
; Ju et al., 2006) and these are utilized for 
embryogenesis.  No striking difference in lipid 
content and class composition (dominated by 
phospholipids and triacylglycerols) of adult  
E. pacifica between OR/WA and the Yellow Sea 
(YS) was found.  Additionally, phospholipid (the 
major structural component of cell membranes) is the 
most abundant lipid class in krill from both regions, 
suggesting that phospholipids might be tightly linked 
with reproduction in E. pacifica as they are for other 
species (Hagen et al., 1996; Mayzaud et al., 2003; Ju 
et al., 2006, 2009).  Based on the timing of 
reproduction and low storage lipid content, 
E. pacifica from OR/WA and YS probably employ 
similar reproductive strategies, at least in relation to 
brood size and energy budgets for reproduction. 
They only reproduce during periods (May to 
September in OR/WA and April in YS) when 
sufficient food is available because energy for 
reproduction (i.e., storage lipids) needs to be 
instantaneously obtained from what they ingest (i.e., 
phytoplankton blooms).  However, lipid contents of 
adult krill in the YS in spring 2012 were slightly 
higher than those from other years and those from 
OR/WA (Fig. 3.4.3).  This higher lipid content might 
be related to environmental conditions (i.e., 
abnormally low water temperatures during the 
previous winter, high food availability) and/or 
physiological status (pre-spawning) of krill at the 
time of sampling.  Further investigation is required to 
understand the lipid dynamics of krill in relation to 
their life history strategies in the Yellow Sea.

from the Oregon coast (black symbols) in comparison with specimens collected in the Yellow Sea in 2011 (blue symbols) 
and 2012 (red symbols). 
  
3.4.4 Dietary Lipid Biomarkers 
Results from dietary lipid biomarkers in conjunction 
with gut content analysis suggest that E. pacifica 
change their diet between spring and summer.  This 
may be due to a seasonal change in the prey field or, 
as discussed above, this may be a result of the krill 
retreating to the YSBCM in response to increasing 
surface temperatures and thus encountering a 
different prey field.  Diatoms (large-sized and 
chained) dominated the prey field in spring while 
small-sized particles were dominant during the 
summer (Fig. 3.4.4a,b).  Krill fed mainly on diatoms 
in the spring but in summer they fed on any particles 
sized from 10 to 200 µm (protozoans, detritus,
dinoflagellates, diatoms, etc., Fig. 3.4.4b).  The 
grouped fatty acid results indicate a decrease in 
PUFA (algal origin) and an increase in BrFA 
(bacterial origin) between spring and summer (Fig. 
3.4.4a), suggesting a shift in diet consistent with a 
change in residence depth.    
 
The results from DVM behavior and diet 
composition strongly suggest that E. pacifica are 
making use of the YSBCM as an over-summering 
refuge by adapting their behavior through changes in 
their diet, their residence depth, and the depth to 
which they vertically migrate.  This adaptation does 
not appear to necessitate any metabolic changes, 
such as diapause or reduction in metabolism.

during spring and summer, 2010.  Large-sized and chained diatoms were dominant in krill guts in spring; small diatoms, 
flagellates, protozoans, and detritus were dominant in summer.

3.5 Russia
Regular surveys have been conducted since 1985 in 
the western Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the NW  
Pacific, and the Japan/East Sea, comprising a total 
area of ~6 million km
2
 (Fig. 3.5.1).  As of 2010 this 
included more than 100 expeditions with 25,000 
trawls, 250,000 stomach samples, and 20,000 
plankton samples.  Standard methods of data 
collection and processing have been used for all 
expeditions.  These regular broad-scale surveys 
provide information for large-scale monitoring of the 
status and dynamics of pelagic communities in these 
areas. Plankton samples are collected simultaneously 
with trawl catches of nekton.  The majority of 
plankton samples have been collected with a Juday 
net (mouth 0.1 m
2
, 168 µm mesh) from 200 m to the 
surface, or near the bottom to the surface in 
shallower areas.  Some stratified sampling has been 
conducted to investigate vertical distribution.  
Samples are processed aboard the ship during the 
expedition using a size-fractioning method that has 
been standard at the Pacific Research Institute of 
Fisheries and Oceanography (TINRO-Centre) for the 
past 25 years.  Data include total quantity of 
zooplankton, species composition,  the role of each 
taxonomic group in the plankton community 
structure, biological information on the most 
abundant species, spatial distribution, vertical 
distribution, seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of 
the abundance of major taxonomic groups, estimates 
of stocks of zooplankton, estimates of the volume of 
zooplankton consumed by nekton, qualitative and 
quantitative characteristics of nekton, and diet 
composition of fish and squid.  The current research 
effort does not include experiments on live 
zooplankton. 
 
 
3.5.1 Distribution  
Five species of euphausiid are found within the 
Russian study area: Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa 
longipes, Thysanoessa inspinata, Thysanoessa raschii, 
and Thysanoessa inermis.  All five of these species 
were found in the Bering Sea and NW Pacific.  
E. pacifica, T. longipes, and T. inspinata were found 
further offshore in the NW Pacific, while T. raschii 
and T. inermis tended to be closer to the coast.  Only 
two species, E. pacifica and T. raschii, were found in 
the Sea of Okhotsk.  T. raschii was found throughout 
the Sea of Okhotsk while E. pacifica was found only 
in the southern portion.  All five species were also 
found in the Japan/East Sea.  T. inermis and T. raschii 
were closer to the coast while E. pacifica, T. longipes, 
and T. inspinata were found both near the coast and 
out into the center of the sea.  The portion of the 
Japan/East Sea that shows no euphausiids was rarely 
sampled so the absence of euphausiids in these data 
may be due to the low number of samples collected in 
this region (Fig. 3.5.2).

Fig. 3.5.2 Distribution of five species of krill in waters off Japan, Korea, and Russia for those regions sampled by Russia.  
The distribution of Euphausia pacifica is highlighted by the yellow line indicating that it is found in the Japan/East Sea 
and into the deeper waters of the Sea of Okhotsk as well as throughout the western Pacific and western Bering Sea.  The 
Russian sampling area does not include the eastern Bering Sea but it is well known that E. pacifica is found there.  
 
There is considerable overlap in the latitudinal range 
of euphausiid species in this area, but certain species 
seem to show a preference for certain habitats  
(Table 3.5.1).  E. pacifica had the widest distribution 
over latitudinal and depth ranges.  T. longpies and 
T. inspinata are both classified as boreal-arctic 
species, but T. inspinata was only found in waters up 
to 200 m deep while T. longipes was found in waters 
up to 2000 m deep.  T. inspinata also remained in the 
more northerly region of the study area.  T. inermis 
and T. raschii were found over a similar latitudinal 
range but segregated by water depth, with T. inermis 
occupying the shelf region and T. raschii occupying 
the neritic zone.  T. longipes, T. inspinata, and 
T. inermis had similar spawning seasons (late winter 
to early summer) while T. raschii and E. pacifica 
started spawning in the spring and continued into the 
fall.

In the Sea of Okhotsk total euphausiid biomass on 
the inner shelf was almost 400 mg m
–3
 in winter and 
spring, almost 600 mg m
–3
 in summer, and just over 
200 mg m
–3
 in autumn.  On the outer shelf, total 
biomass was 200 mg m
–3
 in autumn and winter, and 
~400 mg m
–3
 in spring and summer.  In deep water 
total biomass was ~200 mg m
–3
 in winter, spring, and 
summer, and almost 600 mg m
–3
 in autumn.  The 
abundance of T. raschii and T. longipes in the Sea of 
Okhotsk was related to the thickness and extent of 
the ice cover, with T. raschii dominant on the shelf 
and T. longipes dominant in deep water.   
 
In the NW Pacific, euphausiid biomass was 
essentially zero on the inner shelf during all seasons.  
In outer shelf waters the biomass was ~80 mg m
–3
 in 
winter, 50 mg m
–3
 in spring, and about 125 mg m
–3
 
in summer and autumn.  In deep water the biomass 
was 50 mg m
–3
 in winter, 25 mg m
–3
 in spring, ~60 
mg m
–3
 in summer, and ~125 mg m
–3
 in autumn.   
 
In the Japan/East Sea euphausiid biomass was low on 
the inner shelf (<25 mg m
–3
) in all seasons.  On the 
outer shelf the biomass was <50 mg m
–3
 in winter 
and ~70–90 mg m
–3
 in spring, summer, and autumn.  
In deep water the euphausiid biomass was ~100 mg 
m
–3
 in all seasons.  
  
Early life stages 
Abundance data (indiv. m
–3
) for early life stages 
(eggs, calyptopis, furcilia <3 mm) of all species of 
euphausiids were combined by season and region to 
provide an idea of general trends in these areas 
(Table 3.5.2).  Abundances were highest in all 
regions during the summer, and decreased into 
autumn and winter.  Although this pattern was 
consistent among all regions, winter abundances 
were still relatively high in the NW Pacific region 
(9.78 indiv. m
–3
 vs. <1 indiv. m
–3
 in other regions).  
In all seasons, abundances tended to be higher in the 
Sea of Okhotsk and the NW Pacific and lower in the 
Bering Sea and Japan/East Sea.  Juvenile euphausiids 
were found in the upper portion of the water column 
throughout the year in all four regions. 
 
3.5.3 Diel Vertical Migration 
Comparison of day and night samples of the upper 
50 m and upper 200 m of the water column clearly 
indicates diel vertical migration in all four regions of 
the study area.  Nighttime euphausiid abundance was 
ten times higher than daytime abundance in the upper 
50 m and four times higher than daytime abundance 
in the upper 200 m of the water column.  Migrations 
were weaker in the more northerly areas during the 
summer when the nighttime period was <3 h.  
Samples collected at night definitely provide a more 
accurate estimate of euphausiid abundance. 
  
3.5.4 Caloric Content  
Caloric content (calories (g wet wt.)
–1
) was measured 
for four species of euphausiids in three regions of the 
Russian study area (Table 3.5.3).  Results were 
obtained for some species for spring, summer, and 
autumn while others were measured in one or two of 
these seasons.  These data are of interest to investigate 
the quality of euphausiids as a food source and 
whether that quality varies seasonally.  Seasonal data 
for adult T. longipes and T. raschii from the Sea of 
Okhotsk show that T. raschii caloric content was 
similar in all three seasons, while that of T. longipes 
was decidedly higher in summer and autumn.  Caloric 
content of T. inermis in this region also increased 
considerably between summer and autumn, suggesting 
that these two species may constitute an important 
quality food source for other animals, including 
commercially important species, at this time of year.

the Okhotsk Sea and the NW Pacific show a declining trend in abundance. 
 
 
3.5.5 Long-term Variability of Euphausiid 
Stocks 
The status of euphausiid stocks in four regions (the 
western Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, Japan/East Sea 
and NW Pacific Ocean) have been evaluated as one 
component of the Russian zooplankton studies 
(Fig. 3.5.3).  Results of the Russian sampling 
program show that total euphausiid stocks in the Sea 
of Okhotsk and the NW Pacific were extremely high 
in the period from 1986–1990 and have been 
gradually decreasing since then (Fig. 3.5.3).  Stocks 
in the Bering Sea and the Japan/East Sea are lower 
overall but have not changed appreciably in the 
period from 1986–2006.  This suggests that these 
stocks, while lower overall, are more stable than the 
stocks in the Sea of Okhotsk and the NW Pacific.

3.6 United States of America
Krill on the west coast of the United States are sampled 
routinely in southern California by the California 
Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations 
(CalCOFI) program, in central California by 
scientists from the University of California at Santa 
Cruz and others, in the northern California Current 
off Newport, Oregon, by scientists from NOAA and 
Oregon State University, and in waters off Baja 
California, Mexico, by scientists from CICESE 
(Centro de Investigación Científica y de Educación 
Superior de Ensenada). 
 
3.6.1 Sampling Programs  
 
Southern California:  CalCOFI Program   
A grid of approximately 60 hydrographic stations has 
been sampled quarterly since 1949 (Fig. 3.6.1) with 
some brief gaps in the 1970s.  For details, see 
http://www.calcofi.org.  Bongo net samples are 
collected routinely in oblique tows from the surface 
to 210 m depth.  Euphausiids have been enumerated 
from the samples collected at night in winter and 
spring of each year.  From these samples, interannual 
variations in abundance have been elegantly 
described by Brinton and Townsend (2003) in a 
paper which compares samples from central 
California, southern California, and Baja California.  
Germane to this report are the data on Euphausia 
pacifica which show quite clearly that this is a cold 
water, widespread, oceanic species whose larval and 
juvenile stages are common in coastal waters.   
E. pacifica is the most abundant krill species in these 
samples and biomass is significantly negatively 
correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
(PDO) with biomass higher when the PDO is 
negative.  Typical densities are on the order of 2000 
individuals 10 m
–2 
(Brinton and Townsend, 2003), 
which is equivalent to 200 individuals m
–2
 or 1 m
–3 
when averaged over a 200 m water column.  Recent 
work by Di Lorenzo and Ohman (2013) suggests that 
biomass and sea surface height have a higher 
correlation than biomass and the PDO.  The major El 
Niño events in 1957–58, 1982–83, 1992–93, and 
1997–98 were associated with negative biomass 
anomalies.

Central California:  University of California at 
Santa Cruz   
The distribution of two krill species, E. pacifica and 
Thysanoessa spinifera, were studied in Monterey 
Bay in relation to the distribution and foraging 
behavior of blue whales (Croll et al., 2005).  Krill 
distributions were mapped using both Bongo nets 
and high frequency acoustics (Simrad EY-500 
echosounder operating at 200 kHz).   Results of this 
work suggested that the lengths of krill captured in 
Bongo nets were smaller than the lengths of krill 
estimated from whale feces (mean lengths of 
E. pacifica and T. spinifera eaten by whales were 
16.0 and 19.3 mm, respectively, as compared to 11.8 
and 16.3 mm in the Bongo net samples).  The krill 
were extremely patchy and occurred mostly in 
schools associated with Monterey Canyon.  Mean 
density of individual krill was 1.3 g wet weight m
–3
 
or 39 individuals m
–3
; schools associated with the 
Canyon itself reached densities of 153 g wet weight 
m
–3
 or 4403 individuals m
–3
.  
     
Central California:  Gulf of the Farallones   
Krill have been sampled during May–June as part of a 
central California survey of juvenile rockfish over the 
past 20+ years.  The distribution and abundance of 
krill captured in rockfish trawls (12 m  12 m mouth; 
9 mm cod end liner) have been studied along with 
backscatter signals from a Simrad EK500 echosounder 
operating at 38, 120 and 200 kHz (Santora et al., 
2011a,b).  These results clearly show that krill have 
affinities for particular bathymetric and hydrographic 
habitats (i.e., canyons, isobaths, fronts, Fig. 3.6.2), but 
it is unclear how these factors collectively influence 
krill aggregations.  The rockfish surveys provided the 
opportunity to look at the detailed spatial distribution 
of krill (chiefly E. pacifica and T. spinifera) using 
hydroacoustics in central-northern California waters.  
Distributions were investigated in relation to 
bathymetric slope, distance from shelf break/canyon 
heads and fronts, phytoplankton/Chl-a persistence, 
and sea surface height anomalies (eddy structures).  
This type of work will be extended into waters off 
Oregon and Washington through the Ph.D. research of 
Elizabeth Phillips and her advisor, John Horne, 
University of Washington.

Oregon:  The Newport Time Series  
The Newport time series was established in 1996 and 
is based on biweekly cruises off Newport, Oregon 
(44°40 N). Seven stations are sampled across the 
continental shelf and slope, at distances of 1, 3, 5, 10, 
15, 20, and 25 nautical miles from shore with water 
depths ranging from 20 to 300 m.  Sampling includes 
a CTD profile (Seabird 19 (pre-2010), Seabird 25 
(2010–present) with WetStar fluorometer and 
Seabird 43 oxygen sensor), Secchi disc depth, 
surface water samples for chlorophyll, nutrients, and 
phytoplankton species composition, a vertical 
plankton net tow (½ m diameter 200 µm mesh net) 
from 100 m depth to the surface (5 m off the bottom 
to the surface in shallower waters) and an oblique 
Bongo tow (60 cm diameter, 333 µm mesh net) 
through the upper 25 m of the water column.  Since 
2001, cruises have been conducted at night whenever 
possible to facilitate the collection of adult 
euphausiids.  During the nighttime cruises, euphausiids 
from one side of the Bongo tow are preserved and 
those from the other side are used for live animal 
experiments.  Individual krill are incubated in 500 ml 
or 1 L jars for molting rates (30–60 individuals) and 
brood size measurements (up to 20 females).  
Animals are also transported to the shore laboratory 
on an ad hoc basis for other experiments which have 
included developmental rates, long-term variations in 
brood size and interbrood periods, grazing rates, and 
physiological analyses including carbon content and 
lipid composition.  Data on distribution and 
abundance of copepods, euphausiid eggs, larvae, 
juveniles and adults from these cruises are 
supplemented by a wealth of historical data on 
hydrography, copepods, and euphausiids from 
samples collected in 1969–1973, 1983, 1990–1992 
(copepods and euphausiid eggs and larvae), 1963–
1967 (Smiles and Pearcy, 1971), and 1971–1972 
(juvenile and adult euphausiids; Gómez-Gutiérrez et 
al., 2005).  
Oregon:  The GLOBEC LTOP Time Series   
The Peterson lab also sampled copepods and 
euphausiids at ~40 stations, ranging from 1–85 
nautical miles from shore and water depths to 
~4000 m along five transects from Newport south, in 
February, April, July, September and November 
from 1998–2003 as part of the GLOBEC Long Term 
Observation Program (LTOP) cruises.  Physical, 
chemical, and chlorophyll data from these cruises are 
available online at http://ltop.oce.orst.edu/~ctd/index.
html.  In addition, the Peterson lab sampled 
zooplankton at ~100 stations during each of four 
GLOBEC “mesoscale” cruises (MESO; June and 
August 2000 and 2002) and mapped oceanographic 
features and zooplankton from Newport to Crescent 
City to resolve finer-scale and feature-specific 
copepod and krill distribution and abundance 
associated with eddies, meanders, the upwelling jet, 
and upwelling filaments.  For both the LTOP and 
MESO cruises, zooplankton samples were collected 
with a ½ m diameter (200 µm) net towed vertically 
from 100 m depth to the surface, and a 1 m
2
 
MOCNESS (333 µm) with ten nets in depth-
stratified tows from 500 m depth to the surface.  
Seward Line in Alaska:  U.S. GLOBEC LTOP Time 
Series  
U.S. GLOBEC’s Northeast Pacific program also 
supported Long Term Observations along the Seward 
Line, a set of hydrographic stations first established 
in the 1960s by the University of Alaska (and Dr. 
Tom Royer).  GLOBEC studies emphasized work on 
the biology and ecology of juvenile salmon, 
dominant euphausiid species, several species of large 
copepods, and forage fish (salmon prey) in coastal 
regions of the North Pacific.  Studies focused on how 
these populations are controlled by climatically 
variable physical forcing, especially at large- to 
meso- scales.  Goals were to quantify the importance 
of (a) local primary and secondary production, and 
(b) imported secondary production (e.g., cross-shelf 
import of large-bodied zooplankton (copepods and 
euphausiids) from deeper offshore waters in spring) 
for providing rapid growth and/or high survival of 
juvenile pink salmon in coastal waters of the Gulf of 
Alaska.  Target species of invertebrates were 
copepods (Calanus pacificus and C. marshallae) and 
the euphausiids E. pacifica and T. spinifera.  Station 
locations sampled along the Seward Line are 
available in GLOBEC planning documents, and also 
in Coyle and Pinchuk (2005) and Pinchuk and 
Hopcroft (2006). 
 
3.6.2 Spatial Distribution  
Throughout the California Current, from Mexico to 
Canada, Euphausia pacifica is primarily a 
continental slope and oceanic species.  During the 
upwelling season though, adults may be found in 
shelf waters.  Eggs and larvae are generally far more 
abundant in shelf waters than slope waters off 
Oregon (Gómez-Gutiérrez et al., 2005) and this is 
likely true elsewhere in the California Current.  
Section 3  Country Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 43  39 
3.6.3 Vertical Distribution 
 
Shelf waters   
The vertical distribution of E. pacifica eggs, larvae, 
juveniles and adults was examined using MOCNESS 
samples collected off the Oregon coast in both shelf 
and slope waters at several stations near Newport 
during 1998–2003.  Figure 3.6.3 illustrates the 
changes in vertical distribution between day and 
night at three shelf stations near the Rogue River 
(RR) and Heceta Head (HH).  In two of the three 
MOCNESS tows, eggs were found within the upper 
25 m while in the third, the weighted mean depth of 
eggs was 110 m.  The presence of eggs at depth 
could mean that they were laid at depth or that they 
sank to that depth from surface waters.  Either 
scenario could apply in this instance since eggs can 
sink at a rate of ~120 m per day and hatching times 
are ~40 h. Given these parameters, eggs could easily 
sink to a depth of 110 m before hatching.  
  
The nauplius and calyptopis stages show evidence of 
sinking at night whereas the furcilia stages show 
evidence of diel vertical migration starting at the FIII 
or FIV stages (Fig. 3.6.3, life stages 6 and 7), with 
pronounced diel vertical migrations at the FVII stage 
(life stage 10) as well as for juveniles and adults. 
Slope waters   
Vertical distributions of eggs in four MOCNESS 
tows at slope stations were considerably different 
from shelf stations, with eggs found deeper than 
125 m at all four stations (Fig. 3.6.4).  Nauplii (life 
stage 2) were not found at these stations.  Calyptopis 
and furcilia stages I–VI were restricted to the upper 
50 m by day whereas the furcilia VII, juveniles and 
adults were below the mixed layer by day.  By night, 
eggs were again at depths greater than 150 m.  In this 
case, it seems more likely that the eggs were laid at 
depth, although at a sinking rate of 120 m per day it 
would be possible for them to sink from the surface 
to a depth of 200 m before hatching.  
 
Diel vertical migration is evident beginning with 
Furcilia stage II (Fig. 3.6.4, life stage 5) although this 
behavior is most pronounced for FVII (life stage 10), 
juveniles, and adults.

11 = juveniles and 12 = adults.  Stations are off the Rogue River (RR) and Heceta Head (HH). 
 
3.6.4 Seasonal Cycle of Spawning   
Off Oregon, the first spawning event for E. pacifica 
generally occurs in the spring, with densities of eggs 
up to several hundred per cubic meter.  However, 
spawning behavior is most intense in July and August, 
which are the peak months of upwelling.  Peaks in egg 
densities range from 1000 to 2000 m
–3
 (Feinberg and 
Peterson, 2003).  T. spinifera spawn prior to and 
during upwelling, but with no intense period as seen 
for E. pacifica.  Peaks in T. spinifera egg densities are 
always lower than for E. pacifica.  Further details are 
presented below in the section on brood sizes.   
 
3.6.5 Seasonal Cycles of Abundance  
Seasonal cycles of abundance are probably best 
understood for the Oregon study area due to the 
biweekly year-round sampling program.  Sampling 
on a broader temporal scale (such as quarterly 
sampling by the CalCOFI program) does not allow 
for robust resolution of seasonal cycles.  The 
seasonal cycle of abundance off Newport is shown in 
Figure 3.6.5.  Noteworthy features are that adults and 
juveniles are seldom found in continental shelf 
waters (Stations NH05 and NH15) but when they do 
occur, it is only during the summer upwelling season.   
 
In offshore waters (Station NH25), adults are at least 
one order of magnitude more abundant than at the 
shelf stations.  Abundances of eggs are similar 
among stations and are highest during the summer 
upwelling season.  Early life history stages (nauplii, 
calyptopis and furcilia) are present throughout much 
of the year.

3.6.6 Life History Parameters 
 
Development time and developmental rates 
In order to estimate vital rates such as growth, 
productivity, and mortality from field data, it is 
essential to have accurate information about 
development time to a given life stage and the 
duration of time spent at that stage.  To measure 
development time of E. pacifica off Oregon, gravid 
adult females were collected and transferred to the 
laboratory where females spawned, eggs hatched, 
and larvae were reared at 10.5°C.  Four cohorts of 
larvae were fed to excess with a combination of 
phytoplankton species and monitored daily until they 
reached the juvenile stage.  The euphausiids were 
maintained separately (one individual per jar) from 
the third furcilia (FIII) to the juvenile stage to 
observe developmental pathways.  
 
Individual cohorts developed at nearly the same rate 
until the first furcilia (FI) stage, after which two 
cohorts began to develop significantly faster than the 
others.  Median time to the juvenile stage ranged 
from 51.9 to 60.6 days, with significant differences 
among cohorts.  The first calyptopis stage and the 
third furcilia stage lasted longer than any other stages 
and appear to be bottlenecks in the development of 
this species. Individual development from FIII to 
juvenile varied widely both within and among 
cohorts but most individuals followed one of four 
main developmental pathways.  Over half of the 
euphausiids skipped one development stage between 
FIII and juvenile (58%), although none skipped more 
than one stage. There was no tendency for 
individuals from the same cohort to follow the same 
developmental pathway. This variability in 
development may be even higher in the field and 
could impact mortality calculations and cohort 
analysis from field samples.  For full details of this 
study see Feinberg et al. (2006).  Figure 3.6.6 shows 
the median time to each development stage at three 
temperatures.  Data for 8° and 12°C represent 
medians from all experiments at those temperatures 
(Ross, 1981) and data at 10.5°C represent the median 
for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 from Feinberg et al. (2006).  
These results from two different studies suggest that 
the developmental rate is strongly dependent on 
temperature.  
Brood sizes 
Brood sizes of female E. pacifica based on 
measurements made off Newport, Oregon, were 
published by Gómez-Gutiérrez et al. (2006).  This 
work has been updated as a Working Group 23 
synthesis product (Feinberg et al., 2013, Journal of 
Plankton Research, in press) in which E. pacifica 
brood sizes were compared at eight locations around 
the Pacific Rim: southern California and northern 
California Current, Newport Line, Puget Sound, Gulf 
of Alaska, the Oyashio, Toyama Bay, and the Yellow 
Sea (Fig. 3.6.7).  Brood sizes for E. pacifica were 
highly variable in all regions and ranged from 5 to 
697 eggs female

 overall.  Median brood sizes were 
largest in the Yellow Sea and off Newport; 
maximum brood sizes were largest by far in the 
regions off the coasts of Oregon and Washington,

and the Yellow Sea.  Quantile regression analysis 
revealed that there was a significant relationship 
between female length and brood size at the 95% 
quantile for broods from southern California, 
Oregon, and Washington, as well as Toyama Bay, 
Japan. This suggests that factors such as 
hydrographic conditions, food quantity/quality, and 
physiological condition of females might limit brood 
sizes more in the regions where female length is not 
a limiting factor.

Growth estimated from cohorts and molting rates 
Growth rates and intermolt periods for E. pacifica 
were determined from individual growth rate (IGR) 
experiments carried out over a 7-year period (2000–
2006) on euphausiids collected off the Oregon coast 
(Shaw et al., 2010).  Adult growth rates averaged 
0.020 mm total length (TL) day
–1
 during the summer 
upwelling season and 0.011 mm TL day
–1
during the 
winter downwelling season.  Average intermolt 
period (IMP) was 8 days during upwelling and 11 
days during downwelling.  Growth rates and IMPs 
were highly variable and were not related to surface 
Chl-a concentration or length of the euphausiid.  
Negative growth occurred at all times of year.  
Negative growth rates during winter downwelling are 
likely related to poor feeding conditions while 
negative growth rates during the summer upwelling 
season are likely a result of the euphausiids investing 
ingested energy towards reproduction rather than 
somatic growth.  Growth rates from this study using 
the IGR method were generally lower than 
E. pacifica growth rates from other studies that used 
the cohort analysis method.  Since negative growth 
rates are difficult to capture using cohort analysis, a 
seasonal growth rate was calculated using only the 
positive values from these experiments to compare 
with cohort analysis growth rates.  These seasonal 
positive growth rates were 0.08 mm TL d
–1
 (2.4 mm 
month
–1
) for the upwelling season and 0.04 mm TL 
d
–1
 (1.2 mm month
–1
) for the downwelling season, 
equivalent to weight-specific growth rates of 0.0135 
d
–1
 (upwelling) and 0.0089 d
–1
 (downwelling), and 
are comparable to rates obtained in other studies 
using cohort analysis.  Highest annual growth rates 
during upwelling were measured in 2004 (warm) and 
2006 (cold) years, suggesting that E. pacifica is less 
affected by warm and cool periods than other types 
of zooplankton such as copepods.  
 
Growth rates were also estimated from cohort data 
from preserved samples collected at station NH25 
(25 nautical miles offshore of Newport, 296 m depth) 
every two weeks for 11 years (2001–2011).  Although 
E. pacifica spawn in this area as early as February and 
as late as October in association with phytoplankton 
blooms, there is a period of intense spawning activity 
in July–August which could initiate a cohort that can 
be followed over time.  Since previous research had 
shown that E. pacifica develop from egg to juvenile in 
an average of 60 days (Feinberg et al., 2006), a cohort 
that appears about two months after a spawning event 
could be attributed to those eggs.  
There are a number of issues to consider regarding 
cohort analysis of euphausiids. Euphausiid distribution 
is notoriously patchy which may explain the 
disappearance and reappearance of size modes over 
time.  Size modes may also merge as krill grow due 
to individual variability in development times 
(Feinberg et al., 2006).  Some krill overwinter as 
juveniles, which can skew the timing between the 
appearance of eggs and the appearance of juveniles.  
Krill also grow more slowly at cooler temperatures 
and can even shrink in length under certain 
conditions.  In addition, the winter sampling intervals 
were often >2 weeks due to inclement ocean 
conditions.  The longer sampling interval, combined 
with potentially shrinking animals, can make it 
difficult to follow a cohort.  In spite of all the 
potential difficulties, cohort analysis on this set of 
samples was quite successful.   
 
Cohorts were identified using the maximum 
likelihood technique in MatLab.  This technique 
identifies overlapping distributions that cannot be 
discerned by eye from length frequency graphs.  An 
example of the length frequency data generated using 
this method indicates the presence of two size modes 
where the eye would distinguish only one (Fig. 3.6.8, 
top panel).  The second and third panels (February 6 
and February 14, respectively) show size modes from 
samples collected <2 weeks apart.  Even in that short 
interval there was a measurable increase in each size 
mode.  Cohort growth rates were calculated from the 
change in mean length of each size mode from one 
sampling date to the next.  
 
Growth experiments on live krill and cohort analysis 
yielded similar rates (Fig. 3.6.9) but the results are 
not interchangeable.  Both methods provide useful 
information about euphausiid growth, with results 
from cohort analysis indicating the overall 
population trend and results from molting rate 
experiments illustrating the range of individual 
variability.  Growth rates of individual live krill 
(gray solid circles) show that individual variability is 
very high, ranging from –0.2 mm day
–1
 to 0.3 mm 
day
–1
.  Growth rates from cohort analysis (red 
diamonds) show that growth rates are higher for 
smaller animals and decrease as they reach their 
adult size.  Negative growth occurs frequently for 
individual animals and was also identified 
occasionally with cohort analysis.  For both methods, 
instances of negative growth increased after the krill 
reached 10 mm in length.  This is the approximate 
length at which the krill may become reproductively 
Section 3  Country Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 43  45 
active under favorable environmental conditions.  
Krill that are reproductively active often shrink in 
length as a result of devoting energy to reproductive 
output instead of to somatic growth. 
Feeding and metabolism 
As noted previously in this report, E. pacifica occupy 
a wide range of habitats throughout the Pacific 
Ocean: cold upwelled waters off the Pacific 
Northwest, low chlorophyll regions across the North 
Pacific, and warm, seasonally subtropical waters off 
Japan, Korea, and China.  The success of this species 
in such a wide variety of ecosystems suggests that 
their diets are flexible and that they are able to 
consume a wide range of food types and sizes.  The 
ability to feed on small particles at low 
concentrations is essential for survival in oceanic 
waters.  The morphology of the feeding basket of 
E. pacifica suggests that they are able to filter 
particles as small as 2 μm (Suh and Choi, 1998).

and Tetraselmis chui (TC, 9.2 µm diameter) found

To determine what the euphausiids are eating in the 
ocean, natural assemblage feeding experiments were 
conducted by Xiuning Du, a graduate student from 
Ocean University of China in Qingdao who worked 
in the Peterson lab from September 2009 to April 
2011.  These experiments were conducted prior to 
and during the upwelling season in 2010.  Ingestion 
rates based on cell counts were highly variable, with 
values ranging from –0.6 to 46.3 µg C euphausiid
–1
 
h
–1
 (Table 3.6.2).  During the upwelling season, 
ingestion rates ranged from 4.8 µg C euphausiid
–1
 h
–1
 
(Expt. 6) to 46.3 µg C euphausiid
–1
 h
–1
 (Expt. 9).  
Higher ingestion rates were related to higher food 
concentrations (Expts. 5, 7, 9), and comparatively 
lower ingestion rates were coincident with low food 
supply and upwelling relaxations (Expts. 6, 8).  
Ingestion rates based on Chl-a were also highly 
variable, ranging from 0.04 to 0.9 µg Chl-a  
euphausiid
–1
 h
–1
 during the upwelling season and 
from 0.01 to 0.03 µg Chl-a euphausiid
–1
 h
–1
 before 
the upwelling season was initiated.  Daily ingested 
carbon (Daily Ration, DR) variations were in 
agreement with ingestion rates based on cell counts 
with higher values during the upwelling season 
(2.4~23.3%) and lower values prior to the upwelling 
period (0.04~1.8%).   
 
Ingestion rates were related to food concentrations 
(Fig. 3.6.11), with rates of 3–5 µg C euphausiid

day
–1
 at 50 µg C L
–1
, 15 µg C euphausiid

200 µg C L

, and a maximum of 25 µg C 
euphausiid
–1
 day

 at 260 µg C L

.  Ingestion rates 
increased significantly as total food biomass 
increased (F = 157.06, P < 0.0001, R

= 0.88).

Feeding selectivity   
 
Data from the natural assemblage feeding 
experiments can also determine whether E. pacifica 
have a preference for certain food types.  During the 
experimental period, the microplankton community 
structure showed obvious seasonality, with diatoms 
dominant during bloom periods and small flagellates, 
ciliates, or dinoflagellates dominant during other 
periods.  Krill seem to adapt to ambient food 
conditions by feeding on whatever is available when 
food supplies are low but feeding selectively when 
given the opportunity.    
 
When ciliates dominated the total biomass they were a 
preferred prey item.  Small flagellates (5~20 µm) and 
silicoflagellates were also positively selected under 
these conditions.  When a variety of diatoms were 
available, E. pacifica fed preferentially on Pseudo-
nitzschia spp., Leptocylindrus spp., Chaetoceros spp., 
Coscinodiscus spp., Asterionellopsis glacialis, and 
Thalassiosira spp., as well as small flagellates and 
silicoflagellates.  Under these conditions the krill 
appeared to avoid dominant dinoflagellates such as 
small dinoflagellates and Heterocapsa triquetra as 
well as tintinnids and naked ciliates.  
 
Some prey items were clearly preferred even when 
they were not the dominant prey available.  Krill kept 
their strong preference for the far less dominant 
diatoms such as Asterionellopsis glacialis, Cylindro-
theca closterium, Pseudo-nitzschia spp., and Lepto-
cylindrus spp.  Under these conditions, they also 
preferred the dominant Dinophysis spp., naked 
ciliates (>40 µm) and tintinnids in comparison with 
other dominant prey items such as naked ciliates 
(<40 µm), Protoperidinium spp., and small 
flagellates.   
 
When the prey field was dominated by diatoms 
(Table 3.6.2, Expt. 7) krill showed a strong 
preference for the dominant diatom Chaetoceros spp. 
as well as less dominant diatoms such as Eucampia 
zodiacus, Guinardia delicatula, Pseudo-nitzschia 
spp., Skeletonema spp. and Thalassiosira spp. Krill 
appeared to avoid some dominant diatoms such as 
Lauderia annulata and Leptocylindrus spp., as well 
as naked ciliates.  However, in other experiments 
where diatoms were dominant (Expts. 8, 9), krill 
seemed to avoid the abundant diatom Chaetoceros 
spp. which they had preferred during the previous 
experiment.  Instead, they preferred less dominant 
diatoms such as Lauderia annulata, Leptocylindrus 
spp., Pseudo-nitzschia spp., Skeletonema spp., 
Thalassiosira spp., as well as ciliates.  
   
In general, E. pacifica fed preferentially on large 
dominant phytoplankton over smaller cells 
(flagellates) and always fed on ciliates when they 
were present regardless of whether phytoplankton

were abundant or not.  E. pacifica showed strong 
selectivity for diatoms, although they did not always 
feed preferentially on the dominant species of 
diatom.  Diatoms were selected over other food 
types, even ciliates, during the upwelling bloom 
period.  There was no evidence of a preference for 
dinoflagellates. These results suggest that E. pacifica 
feed preferentially on diatoms and ciliates when they 
have the option.  When they don’t, E. pacifica will 
feed on whatever is available.  This flexibility in diet 
contributes to their ability to survive in the wide 
variety of habitats they occupy throughout the North 
Pacific.   
 
Other research has shown that E. pacifica consumes 
protozoans like ciliates and tintinnids (e.g., 
Nakagawa et al., 2001; Nakagawa et al., 2004).  
Nakagawa et al. (2002) found that heterotrophic prey 
accounted for 57–79% of total ingested carbon (54–
77% from copepods) in May and for 27–93% of total 
ingested carbon (27–93% copepods) in October.  
Ohman (1984) found that E. pacifica in Dabob Bay, 
Puget Sound, Washington, consumed some 
Pseudocalanus sp., though they were considered a 
suboptimal food source compared to diatoms.  
 
Studies of copepods that exhibit diel vertical 
migration generally show empty or near empty guts 
during the day at depth and high feeding activity at 
night near the surface.  In contrast, studies suggest 
that vertically migrating euphausiids continue to feed 
at depth during the day.  Several studies on different 
species of vertically migrating euphausiids have 
found evidence of this feeding strategy.  Nakagawa 
et al. (2003), working in waters off northeastern 
Japan, found that E. pacifica gut contents were 
predominantly phytoplankton at night when the 
euphausiids were feeding near the surface.  During 
the day when the euphausiids were feeding at depth, 
they found copepods and tintinnids in the guts.  
Schmidt (2010) found that Meganyctiphanes 
norvegica fed on phytoplankton at the surface at 
night and fed on copepods and sinking detritus at 
depth during the day.  Stuart and Pillar (1990), 
working in the southern Benguela Current, found that 
Euphausia lucens fed carnivorously at depth during 
the day.  Hamame and Antezana (2010) found that 
euphausiids (not E. pacifica) in the fjords of southern 
Chile fed on phytoplankton near the surface at night 
and on benthic polychaetes during the day at shallow 
stations. Copepods were also more frequently a part 
of the daytime diet.    
 
Feeding by E. pacifica is highly opportunistic, 
adaptive, and flexible and this contributes to its 
success as a species.  In contrast with findings from 
studies of copepods, diel vertical migration does not 
preclude 24 hour feeding by euphausiids.  Their diet 
changes from phytoplankton at night when feeding in 
surface waters, to protozoa and copepods during the 
day when feeding at depth, and possibly even 
benthos if the daytime is spent near the bottom.  The 
ability to feed on a wide variety of prey types – 
phytoplankton, microzooplankton, mesozooplankton, 
marine snow, phytodetritus, and perhaps benthos  
over a broad range of sizes (2 μm phytoplankton to 
copepods that are several mm in length) and particle 
concentrations must certainly contribute to the 
success of E. pacifica in the wide range of different 
environmental conditions it inhabits.  
 
3.6.7 Lipid Analysis 
Off Oregon, E. pacifica lipid reserves showed only 
minor seasonal variations (5–20%, Fig. 3.6.12, Ju et 
al., 2009).  This suggests that E. pacifica are not 
accumulating stored lipids as food reserves but are 
allocating energy to growth and reproduction.  
E. pacifica spawning is closely tied to the timing of 
phytoplankton blooms off Oregon, suggesting that 
this species can maintain itself on a diet of ciliates, 
copepods, marine snow, etc., but needs the 
concentrated pulse of high quality food provided by 
phytoplankton blooms to fuel reproductive activity.

3.6.8 Carbon:Nitrogen (C:N) Analysis  
C:N analysis has been conducted for Euphausia 
pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera juveniles and 
adults collected off Newport.  C:N ratios were 
distinctly different between these two species, 
possibly reflecting different levels of lipid content 
(Fig. 3.6.13).  C:N ratios of E. pacifica (~7–21 mm) 
were constant over this size range, averaging 4.4.  
C:N ratios for T. spinifera (~8–25 mm) were 
generally higher than for E. pacifica, were far more 
variable, and have a higher average (C:N = 5.8).   
Since T. spinifera reach sexual maturity at a body 
length of ~ 12 mm, and since it is at this length that 
C:N begins to increase, this suggests that the change 
in C:N ratio is related to reproduction.  C:N ratios 
may be highest in females with lipid-rich eggs in 
their ovaries.  Future goals are to test this hypothesis 
by analyzing lipid content of the animals by sex, 
maturity stage, and level of ovarian development.

3.6.9 Population Genetics  
The pan-Pacific distribution of E. pacifica has led to 
speculation about whether E. pacifica in specific 
geographic locations constitute distinct populations 
or whether this species can be considered one 
population throughout its range.  Population structure 
can be measured through the comparison of genetic 
diversity between populations.  The Peterson lab 
conducted the first steps in this process by 
identifying regions of variability within the nuclear 
and mitochondrial genome in order to develop the 
tools to measure genetic diversity within populations. 
We identified regions of variability in the 
mitochondrial genomes of several euphausiid species 
(E. pacifica, Thysanoessa raschii and E. superba) 
and developed microsatellites within the nuclear 
genome of E. pacifica.  
 
To date, we have sequenced near-complete 
mitochondrial genomes for E. pacifica and T. raschii 
(Johansson et al., 2012a) as well as five 
mitochondrial genomes of E. superba (Johansson et 
al., 2012b) using 454 next generation sequencing. 
Based on these data we were able to identify regions 
of high variability within the mitochondrial genome 
of all three species.  For example, comparisons 
between Bering Sea and Yellow Sea E. pacifica 
revealed a total of 644 variable sites.  These regions 
of variability within the mitochondrial genome can 
be targeted to describe the genetic diversity within a 
population for comparison to other populations.  
Future genetic analyses can concentrate on these 
regions of high variability since genetic differences 
are likely to be found at these locations.  
Phylogenetic analyses to assess the phylogenetic 
position of the Euphausiacea, using the concatenated 
nucleic acid sequences of E. pacifica and T. raschii, 
along with 46 previously published malacostracan 
mitogenomes, support the monophyly of the order 
Decapoda and indicate that the Euphausiacea share a 
common ancestor with the Decapoda (Johansson, 
2012b).  Other recently published research conducted 
in China also found a close relationship between 
Euphausiacea and Decapoda and suggested a close 
relationship between Euphausiacea and Penaeidae 
(Shen et al., 2011).  
 
We also developed five microsatellite markers for 
E. pacifica using the next-generation sequencing 
based technique developed by Abdelkrim et al. 
(2009). DNA was enriched for microsatellite repeats 
at the Savannah River Ecological Laboratory and the 
enriched library was sequenced using 454 next 
generation sequencing.  Microsatellite repeats were 
identified and primers were designed using 
MsatCommander (Faircloth, 2008). Primers were 
tested for 41 microsatellite loci and five micro-
satellites amplified successfully.  Twenty individual 
E. pacifica from each of four collection sites (Oregon 
coast, Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, and Yellow Sea) 
were screened for five microsatellite loci.  The 
Peterson lab intends to submit a primer note to the 
journal Molecular Ecology Resources with our results, 
including basic statistics (number of alleles at each 
locus, observed and expected heterozygosities, and 
polymorphism) and tests for deviation from Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium.   
 
These markers provide tools to explore the population 
structure of E. pacifica throughout the North Pacific. 
Continued genetic analyses of E. pacifica across the 
North Pacific will provide evidence of the 
evolutionary history of this species and the potential to 
detect underlying population structure and adaption 
throughout the region.

4.1 Background 
Euphausiids are one of the more common taxa 
caught by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR), 
although the largest individuals are probably too 
large to pass through the aperture in the nose cone 
(which is a square with 1.27 cm sides).  The ability 
of the CPR to catch euphausiids has not been 
investigated in any detail although Glover (1962) 
suggests that despite the small aperture, the CPR 
catches large, active organisms such as euphausiids 
perhaps better than a slow-moving net because of the 
high sampling speed and the absence of a bridle in 
front of the aperture.  An additional issue, however, 
is that the CPR is towed at a fixed, near-surface 
depth (~7 m) and because most euphausiids migrate 
closer to the surface at night and/or are less able to 
avoid the CPR at night, abundances in nighttime 
samples are generally much higher.  Nevertheless, 
CPR data have been used to describe the population 
dynamics of euphausiids in the past (Lindley and 
Williams, 1980) and in a study based on CPR 
samples in the early years of the North Pacific CPR 
survey the known range of one euphausiid species, 
Thysanoessa inspinata, was extended (Lindley et al., 
2004).  Euphausiids are not routinely identified to 
species in ordinary CPR sample analysis; the sampler 
is quite hard on organisms and damage is frequent, 
making identification time-consuming. However, 
accomplished analysts could identify the majority of 
specimens.  The full range of species sampled is, 
therefore, not known at this time; however, the 
following have been positively identified from the 
NE Pacific; Thysanoessa inermis, T. longipes, 
T. inspinata, T. spinifera, T. rachii and Euphausia 
pacifica.  
Data from the North Pacific CPR survey were 
examined to determine basic seasonal and interannual 
variability across the region, as a contribution to the 
PICES WG 23 final report.  
4.2 North Pacific CPR Data 
Full details of CPR sampling can be found in Batten 
et al. (2003), but essentially the device is towed 
behind commercial ships at a fixed depth of about 
7 m.  There are two transects operating in the NE 
Pacific; one north–south which is towed about 6 
times per year between the western coast of North 
America and Alaska and one east–west transect 
which is towed 3 times per year between North 
America and Japan.  Seawater enters the front of the 
machine as it is pulled through the water and 
plankton are filtered onto a continuously moving 
band of filtering mesh, with a mesh size of 270 µm. 
The mesh is wound into a storage tank containing 
formaldehyde which fixes and preserves the 
plankton.  Once back in the laboratory, the mesh is 
cut into discrete samples, based on the ship’s log 
information, each representing 18 km of tow, and 
about 3 m
3
 of seawater.  The midpoint of each 
sample is allocated a position, time and date based on 
the log information.  Every fourth sample is analysed 
microscopically and individuals are identified and 
counted. Remaining samples are archived.  Euphausiid 
eggs, nauplii and calyptopis stages are counted in a 
subsample (about 1/50 of the sample) while large 
sub-adults and adults are counted from the whole 
sample.

Fig. 4.2.1 Location of CPR samples (grey dots) collected and analysed, 2000 to 2012.  Note that at the time of this 
writing, the abundance data for 2012 has not been quality controlled and finalized, so only samples up to 2011 have been 
discussed in the text.  Midpoints of the 18 km samples are allocated a latitude (°N) and longitude (°E).  Sub-regions used 
in this report are overlaid. GoA = Gulf of Alaska, BC = British Columbia. 
 
 
 
Of the 4,922 processed CPR samples collected from 
2000 to 2011, 2,527 samples contained euphausiids, a 
little over 51%.  Sub-regions of the sampled area have 
been previously defined and are used here (Fig. 4.2.1). 
These regions are hydro-dynamically distinct, e.g., 
shelf versus oceanic, and span the geographic range of 
the survey.  Figure 4.2.1 shows the location of CPR 
sampling of the North Pacific and the sub-regions 
used in this report. 
 
4.2.1 Seasonal Cycles 
Euphausiids are more abundant in CPR samples at 
night because of diel vertical migration and likely 
lower avoidance of the sampler; however, not all 
regions were sampled equally intensively by day and 
night.  There are more daytime samples because the 
CPR samples are collected between spring and fall 
and at these subarctic latitudes during this timeframe 
there is more daylight than dark.  Mean seasonal 
cycles of adults are shown in Figure 4.2.2.  Where 
sampling was sufficiently frequent  (>4 samples in 
that month) both day and night samples are used to 
calculate two separate monthly averages, otherwise, 
just daytime sample averages are shown.  Note that 
the sample processing of Western Pacific samples 
was taken over by Japanese colleagues after 2009 so 
the data shown here for the Oceanic Western Pacific 
and NE Japan regions are from 2000–2008 only.   
 
The Aleutian shelf region containing Unimak Pass had 
the highest number of euphausiids, day or night, of all 
the regions and, in fact, observations of the filtering 
mesh while unloading the CPR have often predicted 
where the Aleutian shelf was crossed because of the 
density of euphausiids clearly visible on the mesh. 
Both day and night data suggest an increase in 
numbers through the spring and summer, reaching a 
peak in late summer.  This pattern is similar off the 
shelf immediately to the east (Western Gulf of Alaska 
region) and west (Southern Bering Sea region).  The 
seasonal cycle farther east appears earlier, with a peak 
in June in the oceanic region and Northern Gulf of 
Alaska.  Abundances on the northern shelf, in Cook 
Inlet and the Alaska shelf regions are low, though this 
is likely because nighttime samples were too rare to 
include.  The seasonal cycle, again, is earlier with a 
peak in spring in Cook Inlet and summer on the open 
Alaskan shelf.  Not enough months were adequately 
sampled in the Western Pacific to be clear on the 
seasonal cycle but it appears to be late summer that 
sees the highest numbers.  
 
Juvenile euphausiid stages are less common and less 
abundant in CPR samples.  This is likely related to 
depth of sampling with respect to the depth of the 
organisms.  The seasonal cycles are not well defined 
for most regions and so data are not included here 
(but are available on request).

).  Filled circles and black lines = night (righthand 
axis), open circles and grey lines = day (lefthand axis); x axis = month.  
 
 
4.2.2 Interannual Variability 
Not all months in all years were sampled for any 
region, owing to last minute schedule changes by 
the ships, or mechanical failure of the CPR, which 
makes calculation of a realistic annual mean 
problematic.  Furthermore, regions to the east that 
were sampled by the north–south transect were 
sampled normally at least 5 times per year, while 
regions to the west only sampled by the east–west 
transect were sampled, at best, 3 times per year.   
 
Gaps in the time series for eastern regions were 
filled according to the following formula for the 
months April to September, inclusive: 
 
(monthly mean for that month  annual mean 
for that year)/overall monthly mean 
 
For regions to the west, a simple summer mean 
was calculated since this season was sampled each 
year from 2000 to 2011.  Daytime samples only 
were used except for the Northern Gulf of Alaska 
region, which was most often sampled by night, 
where nighttime samples were used.  Resulting 
time series are shown in Figure 4.2.3. 
 
No region has a significant linear trend over the 
whole time series, though the Oceanic NE Pacific 
region (which has the greatest sampling intensity) 
shows a declining trend from 2006 to 2011. 
Euphausiids in CPR Sampling  Section 4 
56  PICES Scientific Report No. 43 
 
Fig. 4.2.3 Mean annual abundance of adult euphausiids per region (see text for derivation and note that abundances 
cannot be compared between regions as method of derivation varies between regions).  y axis = numbers per sample,   
x axis = year.  Region descriptions are given in Figure 4.2.1. 
 
 
Interestingly, all the regions to the east of the 
Aleutian Islands have a positive correlation with the 
annual mean Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) 
while regions west of and including the Aleutian 
Islands have a negative correlation.  None of these 
correlations are significant at p < 0.05.  However, it 
suggests that there is an element of climate forcing in 
the interannual variability shown here, given that the 
PDO has an opposing expression in the eastern and 
western ocean Pacific basins; when positive, the 
eastern NE Pacific tends to be warm while the west 
is cool, and vice versa (see Batten et al. (2010) for 
further information on climate indices).  This 
relationship warrants further examination as the 
times series develops.   
 
In conclusion, the CPR survey can provide broad 
scale information on euphausiids across the PICES 
region and such data will continue to be collected. In 
addition, there is a large sample archive available 
(over 12,000 samples) that researchers can use for 
additional studies.  Anyone interested in further data 
or samples should contact the author of this section.

5 Modeling 
Modeling activities within the krill Working Group were conducted by Dr. Michio Kishi (WG 23 member) and 
Dr. Harold (Hal) Batchelder, using the NEMURO (North Pacific Ecosystem Model for Understanding 
Regional Oceanography) model (Kishi) and Individual-Based Modeling (IBM, Batchelder). 
 
5.1 NEMURO Model  
Aita et al. (2003) first showed the results of 
NEMURO (Kishi et al., 2007a,b) embedded in a 
three-dimensional ocean physical model and pointed 
out the importance of vertical migration of copepods 
in the Northern Pacific, which was also identified by 
Kishi et al. (2001).  NEMURO contains a 
compartment for predatory zooplankton (ZP), which 
includes jellyfish, krill, and other higher trophic 
animals.  Different life stages of krill are not 
incorporated into NEMURO; however, there are 
some continuous modeling efforts being done on 
copepods related to NEMURO.  Terui and Kishi 
(2008) modified NEMURO by adding population 
dynamics of a copepod (Neocalanus cristatus), and 
Terui et al. (2013) added a Lagrangian ensemble 
model of it.  These models reveal the behavior of 
Neocalanus and their role in relation to lower trophic 
levels of the ecosystem in the northwestern Pacific.  
Efforts toward modeling krill in the northwestern 
Pacific are still ongoing.  As shown in Kishi et al. 
(2009) and Kishi et al. (2010), the output of ZP from 
the NEMURO model can be useful as an indicator of 
prey for chum salmon or Pacific squid.  The results 
obtained thus far suggest that the initial NEMURO 
model provides a good representation of conditions in 
the northwestern Pacific.  
5.2 Individual-Based Models and 
Bio-physical Models 
Modeling of cross-shelf transport in the Oregon 
upwelling zone was done by Dr. Hal Batchelder and 
his Ph.D. student, Brie Lindsey.  The initial goals of 
these efforts were to (1) model the population 
dynamics of Euphausia pacifica,  including birth and 
death rates, growth rates, and secondary production, 
and (2) investigate mechanisms of transport, retention, 
and loss of euphausiids in the Oregon upwelling 
system using coupled bio-physical and individual 
based models.  Results from their effort to develop the 
coupled bio-physical models to investigate the role of 
transport in controlling retention and loss are reported 
below and in Lindsey and Batchelder (2011).  
Modeling of the population dynamics is still ongoing.  
  
The Oregon coast is characterized by a summer 
upwelling season with frequent upwelling-favorable 
wind events interspersed with relaxation of the 
winds.  The resulting offshore movement of surface 
waters may make exploitation of the favorable 
nearshore environment a challenge for young, non-
migratory euphausiid life stages that reside in the 
strongest offshore surface flows, while older life 
stages that engage in diel vertical migration spend 
more time deeper in the water column and are 
transported offshore at a slower rate or even remain 
nearshore.  Lindsey and Batchelder postulated that 
the ratios of migrating life stages to non-migrating 
life stages of E. pacifica will reflect differential 
transport of these life stages and result in specific 
patterns of this ratio as a function of recent winds 
and distance offshore.  The initial attempts were 
based on this metric, the ratio of migrating to non-
migrating stages (R
M:N
),

and where i indicates the life stage (1 = egg, 2 =

nauplii (2 stages), metanauplius (1 stage) and first 
calyptopis stage, and i = 11–14 represents the 
summed abundances of the migratory furcilia (F4–
F7) stages.  The range of this sample statistic is 0.0 
(only non-migrators present) to 1.0 (only migrators 
present).  Examination of this statistic for samples 
having different recent (1–2 days previous) wind 
histories of upwelling vs. non-upwelling, and for 
inshore and offshore stations sampled on the same 
day (thereby having identical wind histories) 
provide evidence of differential cross-shelf 
advection of migrating vs. non-migrating stages of 
E. pacifica.  
 
Lindsey and Batchelder (2011) found that cross-shelf 
trends in abundance were not always consistent, 
either in the model or in the data.  What seemed at 
first a straightforward and testable idea (that 
ontogenic diel vertical migration serves to retain 
zooplankton in upwelling zones) was difficult to test 
with the physical model because of confounding 
interactions of time- and location-dependent 
spawning and strong alongshore (and potentially 
cross-isobath) transport driven by wind-forced 
Ekman transport.  They found the question was 
more complex than envisaged because it involves 
not only cross-shelf data, but also knowledge of 
alongshore transport, stage-specific development 
times, individual variability in behavior, and 
ultimately spawning locations upstream of the 
sampling locations.

6.1 Euphausiid Live Work Protocol  
The protocols used by the Peterson lab for 
measurement of euphausiid molting rates and brood 
sizes were published to the PICES website in 2005 to 
assist other euphausiid researchers with incorporating 
these types of experiments into their existing research 
programs.  Using consistent methods among projects 
generates data that are comparable among regions.  
Data from Japan and Korea from experiments using 
this protocol are included in the pan-Pacific brood 
size comparison paper by Feinberg et al. (Journal of 
Plankton Research, in press July 2013).

6.2 Zotero Publications Database 
In partial fulfillment of the terms of reference for 
WG 23, members worked towards making krill-
related publications more readily available (see Other 
Publications  on  the WG  23 webpage, http://www.pices.
int/members/working_groups/Disbanded_working_g
roups/wg23.aspx).  In particular, they focused on 
publications that were not readily accessible 
electronically and papers that were originally published 
in a language other than English.  Publications that 
were not easily available online included older 
publications, publications that appeared in the form of a 
technical report or institutional publication, and those 
published in journals that had limited electronic access 
(for example, that might only be accessible within 
certain countries).  For papers that were originally 
published in a language other than English, the goal 
was to identify these papers and post partial translations 
– methods, results, figure captions and table legends. 
Toward this end, the group used the online 
bibliographic resource called Zotero to create a WG 23 
krill library.  Zotero groups allow researchers to:  
 Share their own work or sources they have 
discovered with others who are working in related 
areas; 
 Collaborate with colleagues, publicly or privately, 
on ongoing research;

6.3 International Collaborations 
6.3.1 Visiting Scientists 
Xiuning Du  
Ocean University of China, Qingdao 
Xiuning Du worked in the Peterson lab in Newport, 
Oregon, USA, from September 2009 to April 2011.  
She conducted experiments on feeding rates and 
preferences of Euphausia pacifica, which yielded 
new and interesting data on dietary preferences of the 
species when feeding on natural assemblages.  This 
research comprised a substantial portion of her Ph.D. 
thesis.  Xiuning Du was honored at PICES-2010 in 
Portland, Oregon, with the “Best Oral Presentation” 
award in a BIO-sponsored Topic Session.  She also 
wrote and submitted a paper on harmful algal blooms 
off the Oregon/Washington coast using archived 
samples from the Peterson lab.  She completed her 
Ph.D. in December 2011. 
   
Ramiro Riquelme-Bugueño  
Universidad de Concepción, Chile 
Ramiro Riquelme-Bugueño conducted research in 
the Peterson lab during the summer of 2011.  The lab 
in Concepción, Chile was severely damaged by a 
tsunami in February 2010 so this visit provided him 
with an opportunity to conduct experiments on live 
euphausiids.  The collaboration explored using 
measurements of the euphausiid hepatopancreas as 
an indicator of physiological condition. He 
completed his Ph.D. in January 2012.  
  
Nelly Tremblay 
Alfred Wegener Institute, Bremerhaven, Germany  
Nelly Tremblay visited the Peterson lab in 
September 2011 and April 2012 to conduct 
experiments on the effects of hypoxia on live 
euphausiids as part of her Ph.D. research.  Her 
project consists of conducting hypoxia experiments 
on euphausiids from several different geographic 
locations during two seasons each.  She returned to 
her lab in Germany with over 500 frozen samples 
from each of her visits to the Peterson lab.  She is 
currently in the process of analyzing these samples 
and expects to complete her Ph.D. by 2014. 
   
Dr. Toru Kobari  
Kagoshima University, Japan 
Dr. Toru Kobari spent four months of his sabbatical 
working in the Peterson lab from June to September 
2012.  He conducted extensive experiments on live 
euphausiids and copepods to analyze various 
methods of determining zooplankton production 
using biochemical assays (nucleic acids ratio, AARS, 
chitobiase, etc.).  These samples are currently being 
analyzed in his lab at Kagoshima University in 
Japan.  Dr. Kobari also expects to submit a proposal 
to PICES to establish a working group on 
zooplankton production.

6.3.2 Laboratory Visits 
Dr. Bill Peterson spent two weeks in Qingdao, China 
in December 2011, attending the Ph.D. defense of 
Ms. Xiuning Du and presenting seminars at each of 
the four oceanographic institutes in Qingdao.  During 
this visit, Dr. Peterson was appointed to an Adjunct 
Professorship at Ocean University of China by Prof. 
Quangxing Lu.  Dr. Peterson visited Qingdao for a 
week in May 2012 to collaborate with WG 23 Co-
Chairman, Prof. Song Sun, on the preparation of this 
report.   
 
6.3.3 Collaborative Sampling 
Tracy Shaw (WG 23 member, USA) was invited by 
Dr. Se-Jong Ju (WG 23 member from Korea) to 
participate in a Yellow Sea research cruise in August 
2011 on the Korean research vessel R/V Eardo.  She 
was subsequently invited back for cruises in April of 
2012 and 2013.  During these cruises, she and 
members of Dr. Ju’s staff conducted experiments on 
live E. pacifica to measure growth, egg production, 
and feeding, and collected E. pacifica specimens for 
lipid and biochemical analyses.   
 
Dr. Peterson (WG 23 member, USA) acquired 
funding to conduct some preliminary work on the 
population genetics structure of E. pacifica.  WG 23 
members were instrumental in obtaining E. pacifica 
specimens from around the North Pacific in order to 
compare individuals from a variety of geographic 
locations.  In addition to samples collected by the 
Peterson lab off of Oregon, E. pacifica specimens for 
comparison were collected in the Oyashio region of 
Japan by Dr. Yuji Okazaki (WG 23 member), from 
the Yellow Sea by Dr. Se-Jong Ju, and from the 
Bering Sea by Tracy Shaw (as part of the BEST 
project).

Appendix 3   
Questionnaire for Euphausiid Experts  
Below is a questionnaire prepared by Dr. Jaime Gómez-Gutiérrez (CICIMAR, La Paz, Baja California, 
Mexico) and sent to euphausiid researchers world wide prior to the 2009 GLOBEC Open Science Meeting in 
Victoria, Canada.  The questionnaire is followed by a sample response.  
 
 
 
Workshop 10: Krill biology and ecology in the world's oceans 
 
.  
 
We are interested to know who is currently active in research that mostly involves euphausiids in their academic 
agenda to present a summary of krill experts in the forthcoming Workshop 10 entitled “Krill biology and ecology in 
the world's oceans” that will be held at Victoria, Canada next June 22-26, 2009 as part of the 3
rd
 and final GLOBEC 
Open Science Meeting entitled “Marine Ecosystems: from function to prediction”. For this purpose we invite you to fill out 
this short questionnaire (13 questions at 2 pages that will take you about 10 minutes to fill out). This will help us to 
obtain precise and updated information about your current academic status and research interest to be used 
exclusively for academic purposes in benefit of the advance in knowledge of euphausiid biology and ecology. A 
summary of this information will be shown and distributed among the scientist that attend the workshop 10 in the 
second discussion day in the meeting to enhance international collaboration in future research projects and 
integration of knowledge of euphausiid biology and ecology. To stimulate you to fill out this form you will receive 
via e-mail a complete list of krill scientist of the world and a summary of this information after the meeting, 
independently if you assist or not to the workshop at Victoria Canada krill meeting. 
 
A first e-mail was sent in January to about 165 krill scientists and unfortunately we have been receiving only 19 
answered formats (12% and they were not included in this email). We would like to know your opinion and 
hopefully to obtain >75% response of the list of experts. Please re-distribute this questionnaire to other scientists 
and students not included in this preliminary e-mail list of experts.  
 
Please send filled out query file attached to the following e-mail address: jgomezgu@gmail.com 
 
Thank you very much for your valuable help with this questionnaire.

2008 REPORT OF WORKING GROUP 23 ON COMPARATIVE ECOLOGY 
OF KRILL IN COASTAL AND OCEANIC WATERS AROUND  
THE PACIFIC RIM 
 
 
The Working Group on Comparative Ecology of Krill in Coastal and Oceanic Waters around the Pacific Rim 
(WG 23) convened its first meeting on October 24, 2008 under the co-chairmanship of Drs. William Peterson 
and Song Sun.  At least 16 persons attended the full workshop with perhaps the same number attending 
portions of the workshop.  A list of those who attended the complete workshop can be found at the end of this 
report (WG 23 Endnote 1).  A draft of the agenda was reviewed and adopted without changes (WG 23 Endnote 2).     
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 2 
Summary of research – Country reports 
 
One member from each PICES member country provided a 30-minute summary of past, present and future 
research related to krill species in local waters, with emphasis focused on Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa 
spp.  Although the presentations are not available on the PICES website, anyone interested in a certain talk can 
e-mail the author or Co-Chairman, bill.peterson@noaa.gov, to request a copy. 
 
Canada   
Dr. David Mackas informed the Working Group that the earliest work on life cycle, growth rate and production 
of E. pacifica in the Strait of Georgia was by Heath (1977, Ph.D. thesis).  Coastwide surveys of 
ichthyoplankton in 1980 were used to summarize krill cohort structure and growth (Fulton et al. 1982). A 
thesis by Summers (1993) explored growth of Thysanoessa spinifera.  Studies of long-term variations in 
abundance of E. pacifica and T. spinifera have been carried out by Tanasichuk (1998); Dr. Mackas tracks long-
term changes in abundance from his sampling program off the west coast of Vancouver Island, including the 
study of cross-shelf transport and retention mechanisms, and patchiness and their causes have been 
investigated recently.   Dr. Steve Romaine (DFO, Institute of Ocean Sciences) has developed algorithms for 
calculating the patch structure of krill from acoustic surveys in the Strait of Georgia.  Strengths of the 
Canadian program are: spatial distribution, population dynamics, and a long time series.  Gaps include the 
need for work on live animals, especially for rates of metabolism and reproduction, and the study of 
mechanism(s) of population regulation, including reproduction, predation and parasites. 
 
China   
Dr. Song Sun stated that the dominant species in Chinese waters are Euphausia pacifica and Pseudeuphausia 
sinica.  Most of the work in China is focused on sampling and experimental work in the Yellow Sea and the 
East China Sea, but with some research on the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba.  Euphausia pacifica, along 
with the copepod Calanus sinicus, are the dominant species in both the Yellow and East China seas, and thus 
receive most of the research attention.  Major research cruises were carried out monthly in summer and 
quarterly in winter to determine krill distribution and abundance.  They are most abundant in the middle of the 
relatively shallow Yellow Sea (maximum water depths of about 90 m) with a maximum in adult biomass in the 
autumn.  Maxima in abundances of eggs are in the spring, similar to that reported for the northeast coast of 
Japan.  Egg production experiments showed that spawning is most intense in March–May, averaging about 40 
eggs per female in April and May.  A major piece of research needed is to understand how the adults survive 
the very warm summer months when surface waters in the Yellow Sea can exceed 25°C.  Apparently the 
adults reside in the deeper (and colder) waters of the Yellow Sea and migrate each night to the base of the 
pycnocline to feed on phytoplankton. 
Appendix 4  WG 23 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 43   81 
Japan  
Dr. Yuji Okazaki presented an “Overview of krill biology and ecology in the western North Pacific”.  He 
reported on the krill fishery off the east coast of northern Japan – the fishery takes place from February to May 
and is well-regulated.  Krill are harvested mostly for the aquaculture industry but some are dried for human 
consumption.  In terms of research, the published work of Taki on distribution (including vertical distribution), 
abundance and growth was reviewed. Some new work on egg production was presented showing that 
Euphausia pacifica can lay eggs during temperatures as low as 5°C in April, at the time of the spring bloom; 
the major spawning season is April–May; egg production measurements have been made April–July, with an 
average output of approximately 60 eggs per female.  Dr. Okazaki also reviewed Japanese work on 
Thysanoessa spp. and noted that they seldom make up more than 10% of the total euphausiid biomass. New 
work is now being prepared for publication on Thysanoessa by Taki and Kim from Hokkaido University.  The 
available historical data were reviewed, and Dr. Okazaki noted that the euphausiids from the Odate collection 
have not been analyzed but cautioned that the small mouth of the Norpac net may have resulted in low catches 
of krill.  Collections from the PH-line (off Hokkaido) are being processed for eggs and larvae, and taxa that 
likely do not avoid plankton nets.  Future work is planned to concentrate on sampling along the A-line which 
will focus on comparison of krill in nets of various sizes (bongo vs. MOHI net), and on growth rate 
experiments.   
 
Korea  
The Korean report was given by Dr. Hyoung-Chul Shin.  Surveys of krill in Korean waters have been 
conducted by the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI) on a bimonthly basis but 
these samples have not been processed for krill eggs, larvae, juveniles or adults.  Surveys of krill in the Yellow 
Sea in spring and fall were reported by Yoon (2000). Distributions seemed to be controlled more by 
temperature than by chlorophyll.  Dr. Shin also reported on some work carried out at a nuclear power plant – 
the screens for water intake used for the cooling towers can at times be clogged with Euphausia pacifica – we 
heard a report on this at the krill Topic Session on “Life history and ecology of euphausiids in coastal and 
oceanic waters around the Pacific Rim” (S2) (Chae, PICES XIV). The potential is great for additional work on 
krill in Korean waters and plans are being discussed that may lead to new work on distribution, abundance, 
feeding, egg production, and growth.  Ships are available for surveys and in-house expertise exists for 
identification of krill as well as the use of acoustics during krill surveys that could be used to estimate krill 
biomass and patch structure.  There is also expertise on lipid analysis that would help clarify krill’s role in the 
food chain. 
 
Russia  
Dr. Yury Zuenko stated that there are no scientific programs focused on euphausiids in Russia. However, 
euphausiids are (and were always) studied as a part of the zooplankton community.  General information is 
available on zooplankton resources, distribution, species composition, and biology of the main species, 
including euphausiids, in the Far-Eastern Seas and Northwest Pacific.  Within regional ecosystem-based 
programs, the Pacific Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (TINRO-Centre) conducts annual 
surveys of zooplankton (sometimes twice in a year) over the Okhotsk Sea and western Bering Sea, and off the 
Kuril Islands. From time to time (once in 3–4 years) the northern Japan Sea is surveyed.  Foreign EEZs are 
surveyed within bi-lateral programs with Japan and the U.S.A. (previously also with the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea (North Korea) and China).  Again, although krill are not the target species, they are 
collected in the plankton nets but probably only the eggs and larvae are collected quantitatively.  Although 
many samples have been collected, many need to be analyzed, giving the opportunity for joint collaborative 
work.  There are as yet no plans for any experimental work although such work could move forward with 
proper training. 
 
U.S.A.   
Ms. Tracy Shaw reviewed the research that has been carried out in the California Current, Gulf of Alaska and 
Bering Sea by as many as 30 investigators.  Her comprehensive talk covered work in the laboratory on vital rates, 
including developmental times, bioenergetics, physiology and respiration, feeding, growth and reproduction.  
Field work on age structure, seasonal cycles of spawning, seasonal and interannual variations in brood sizes, and 
growth were compared.  She also reviewed synthesis activities planned by the U.S. GLOBEC program.

AGENDA ITEM 3 
Gaps in krill research that need to be filled  
 
WG 23 prepared an outline which listed the gaps in knowledge and plans for research that will fill those gaps.  
The Working Group discussed what research needed to be done to produce a synthesis and comparison of the 
ecology, life history and population dynamics of krill around the Pacific Rim.   
 
1.  Standardization of sampling through use of the same nets, or, if this is not possible, the need for 
“catchability coefficients” of krill by various types of nets.  Better estimates of abundance and biomass are 
needed in order to be able to make regional comparisons.   
2.   Size of animals in different regions and seasonal differences in size; comparative length-weight 
regressions.   
3.   Feeding habits and diets through experimental work on living animals and through use of lipid biomarkers 
and stable isotopes.   
4.   Aggregations of krill.  This needs more study – what are the advantages to an individual for staying within 
a swarm?  Are there physiological benefits?  More night sampling is needed.  
5.   Age of adults.  More work is needed to explore the utility of the lipo-fuscein method of age-determination.   
6.   Sampling in critical habitats.  Are there “critical habitats” that we are not sampling and which need more 
study?  Suggested examples include the Japan/East Sea, particularly in Korean waters, Monterey Bay 
(CA), Heceta Bank (OR), Unimak Pass (AK), Northeast Japan.   
7.   Use of acoustics to estimate biomass and patch structure.   
8.   Modeling of krill.    
9.   More measurements of egg production rates in relation to temperature and chlorophyll.  
10.  A project that looks at population structure using modern techniques of microsatellites or SNPS is needed 
to determine the degree to which populations of Euphausia pacifica are connected. 
11.  An interest was expressed in setting up a “krill library” where all important publications could be 
available.  This would include theses, cruise reports, and grey literature.  Ideally, all would be available in 
English.   
12.  All participants expressed interest in having a set of digital photographs of krill life cycle states that could 
be used in presentations.  Also, any video clips showing krill aggregations would be of interest as well.  
These could all be stored on the same website where the “krill library” was maintained.  The need to find a 
“home” for this material, perhaps on the PICES webpage was discussed.     
 
Also discussed was the possibility of using krill in NEMURO models that would compare zooplankton 
population dynamics in waters around the Pacific Rim (see for example a recent paper by Terui and Kishi 
(2008), Population dynamics model of Copepoda (Neocalanus cristatus) in the northwestern subarctic Pacific. 
Ecological  Modelling 215: 77–88.) 
 
A final report was given by Dr. Micho Kishi, Hokkaido University, Japan.  He reviewed progress on his and 
his student’s work on incorporating krill into the NEMURO modeling framework.  The model has stage-
specific feeding rates, with larvae feeding on two size-classes of phytoplankton, and juveniles and adults 
feeding on both phytoplankton and on copepods.  Developmental rates and transition times between stages 
follow data in Ross (1982).  The model seemed to do a reasonable job in tracking the seasonal cycles of 
abundance of eggs, larvae, juveniles and adults, given the agreement between the model and observations of 
Taki (2004), and reported by Dr. Okazaki in Japan’s report (Agenda Item 2). 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 4 
Exchange of scientists, graduate students and post-docs 
 
The Working Group discussed the potential for an exchange of scientists, graduate students, and post-docs in 
order to learn from one another how best to sample euphausiids and how to conduct experimental work on 
living krill.  Also discussed were any cruise plans for 2008–2009 that would benefit from international 
Appendix 4  WG 23 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 43   83 
cooperation; possible visits to other laboratories; and the possibility of convening “hands-on” practical 
workshops during which the Working Group would teach students and other scientists how to carry out 
experimental work with krill  
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 5 
General discussion  
 
A portion of the general discussion was set aside to hear a talk by Dr. Jaime Jahncke on “Krill related studies 
in the Gulf of the Farallones, California”.  This contribution was to be a poster presented during the Poster 
Session of main PICES Annual Meeting but seemed that it would be useful to include it during our meeting.  
The talk included discussion of a large research program that is working on spatial and temporal relationships 
between krill and seabirds that nest on island in the Gulf of the Farallones, located offshore of San Francisco.  
Of particular interest is krill patchiness and patch size and how this relates to forage opportunities for the sea 
birds, in particular the Cassin’s auklet.   
 
Most of the remaining time was devoted to a general discussion of the krill workshop planned for the 
GLOBEC Open Science Meeting to be held in Victoria June 2009.  The workshop, entitled “Krill biology and 
ecology in the World’s oceans”, is being organized by Dr. Peterson along with Drs. Angus Atkinson, Bettina 
Meyer and Jaime Gómez-Gutiérrez (WG 23 Endnote 3).  The objective is to convene a gathering of krill 
biologists and ecologists from around the world to discuss the life history and population dynamics of all krill 
species.  These discussions were first initiated at the 4
th
 International Zooplankton Production Symposium in 
Hiroshima, Japan, May 2007.  A number of Working Group members agreed to submit abstracts for the 
GLOBEC meeting – Yuji Okazaki, Song Sun, Hyoung-chul Shin, David Mackas and William Peterson.

Proposal for a 2-day workshop at the GLOBEC Open Science Meeting in June 2009 in Victoria, 
Canada, on “Krill biology and ecology in the World’s oceans” 
 
Chairs:  Angus Atkinson (UK), Jaime Gómez-Gutiérrez (Mexico), Bettina Meyer (Germany) and William 
Peterson (U.S.A.)  
 
Objective:   To convene a gathering of krill biologists and ecologists from around the world to discuss the life 
history and population dynamics of all krill species.  This is timely because krill have been important elements 
of a number of the GLOBEC core programs and a great deal has been learned from the GLOBEC fieldwork 
that needs to be synthesised. These discussions were first initiated at the 4
th
 International Zooplankton 
Production Symposium, in Hiroshima, May 2007.  At that meeting we convened a workshop and were 
overwhelmed with presentations (42 oral and poster presentations) and attendance (approx 100 participants).   
A product of the meeting was a special issue of selected papers from the Symposium to be published in Deep-
Sea Research II;  the special issue is now in the final editing phase.  A total of 18 research papers have been 
found to be acceptable for publication.  
 
Aims of the proposed GLOBEC OSM Workshop include: 
 For workers on different species to get together to discuss methods/approaches that have proved effective 
for one species. Then we can see whether they can be applied to other euphausiid species. 
 To make sure there is a degree of harmony (or at least that there is no serious disconnect) in their 
approaches.  It is also to improve technical aspects of specific methods. 
 To generate ideas for future collaborations, for example laboratory/seagoing exchanges of personnel and 
of exchange and pooling of datasets to address wider-scale issues. 
 To produce a tangible product, to show where krill research is at the moment, hurdles to progress and 
potential solutions.   We suggest that an overview type paper in MEPS/review length journal (authored 
e.g., by all participants) would be excellent.  
 
We propose a 2-day workshop, with the first day being a series of short 10-minute presentations with, say, a  
5-minute discussion around each (15 minutes total).  These presentations would have some data (obviously) as 
examples, but would aim to give more of a flavour of the state of the research in their own lab/research group 
in relation to the session theme, with some questions, future directions and “hooks” to start the discussion. The 
second day could then be devoted to framing particular themes and issues for more detailed discussion, then 
breakout groups, etc., before coming together at the end to talk about how we are all going to put together the 
written product.  We expect active participation by young investigators and graduate students.   
 
The Table below shows some topics that may be valid, with some potential speakers/contributors. This is 
clearly incomplete and of course there is some overlap across themes. Also note that some topics, e.g., 
modelling and genetics, are blended across several themes.  An alternative approach would be to have them as 
separate, defined themes.

REPORT OF WORKING GROUP 23 ON COMPARATIVE ECOLOGY OF 
KRILL IN COASTAL AND OCEANIC WATERS AROUND  
THE PACIFIC RIM* 
 
 
The meeting of Working Group on Comparative Ecology of Krill in Coastal and Oceanic Waters around the 
Pacific Rim (WG 23) held its second meeting on October 23, 2009 in Jeju, Korea. A list of participants and the 
meeting agenda can be found in WG 23 Endnotes 1 and 2. The meeting was chaired by Ms. Tracy Shaw, as the 
Co-chairs, Drs. Song Sun and William Peterson, were unable to attend. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 2 
Presentation on status of krill research in each PICES member country  
 
The meeting started with presentations on the status of krill research in each PICES member country that had a 
representative in attendance:  Canada (Mackas), Japan (Okazaki), Korea (Ju), U.S.A. (Shaw). These 
presentations were based on the Working Group’s Term of Reference #6 (Convene a krill workshop at the 
GLOBEC Open Science Meeting in May 2009).  This led to discussion of what topic to address in the first 
synthesis paper and what data to collect to enhance the available data set.  Brood sizes of Euphausia pacifica 
were a likely candidate as scientists in China and Japan have recently conducted such experiments and there is 
a possibility that scientists from Canada and Korea will be able to conduct brood size experiments during their 
research cruises next year.  Collection of such data is ongoing in Dr. Peterson’s lab at the Northwest Fisheries 
Science Center (NOAA) and there is a hope to recruit other scientists working on the California Current. 
  
 
AGENDA ITEM 3 
Specific terms of reference (TOR) 
 
The other main topic of discussion (TOR #1) was on assembling lists of existing data that will contribute to an 
analysis and comparison of the life histories of E. pacifica and Thysanoessa.  Egg production, development 
times, growth rates, distribution and abundance, migration, biomass, hot spots, seasonality of spawning in 
relation to phytoplankton blooms, role of krill as grazers, vertical flux of carbon in fecal pellets (and moults?) 
had been discussed previously and to this list krill strandings were added.  The latter are reported regularly 
and, although there are many theories as to why they occur, they are not well understood.   
 
The translation into English of papers which would facilitate a comparative ecological analysis is another goal 
of this Working Group. Noting that translation of entire papers is a tremendous project, the Group considered 
translating only parts of each paper (such as the abstract and conclusions) and expanding the figure captions to 
include more detail.  It is possible that this could be done cooperatively by members of the Working Group.  
Upon completion, the documents could be made available via the PICES website.   
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 4 
Research during PICES/ICES/FAO symposium  
 
WG 23 members discussed the possibility of “hands-on” research in association with the PICES/ICES/FAO 
Symposium on “Climate change Effects on Fish and Fisheries” in Sendai, Japan, from April 26–29, 2009.  Dr. 
Yuji Okazaki will look into the possibility of a visit to his lab at the Tohoku National Fisheries Research 
Appendix 4   WG 23 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 43   87 
Institute in Shiogama, Japan.  The Peterson lab at Oregon State University, U.S.A. has been invited to 
participate on a Korean research cruise in 2010.  These two activities are in accordance with TORs #2 (Prepare 
a research plan to help fill gaps in our understanding, and aid regional collaborative research efforts. Explore 
ways and means of facilitating exchange of scientists between laboratories and on research cruises) and #3 
(Convene “hands-on” practical workshops with krill biologists (including students and established scientists) 
from PICES member countries to help them initiate and carry out krill research programs. These workshops 
could be convened before each PICES Annual Meeting, or at other times as appropriate. Protocols for 
experimental  work  have  been  already  published  on  the  PICES  website  at  http://www.pices.int/projects/
Euphasiid/PICES%20Protocols%20COMPLETE.pdf).   
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 5 
Attendance at Workshop W4 on “Marine ecosystem model inter-comparisons” at PICES-2009 
 
WG 23 discussed collaboration with PICES modelers (TOR #5; Work with modelers to better parameterize 
euphausiids in the NEMURO model and other models so as to explore their role in coastal and oceanic food 
chains).  Specifically, that euphausiid modeling should incorporate the differing characteristics of different life 
stages, i.e., in a model, early larval stages behave similarly to a copepod but older life stages behave quite 
differently from copepods.  Dr. David Mackas reported on the modeling efforts of Dr. David Preikshot at the 
University of British Columbia, Canada.  He is using ECOPATH to model different life stages of euphausiids 
and is including gelatinous zooplankton, with approximately monthly time steps.

*Post-Jeju Progress   
 
Based on discussions at the WG 23 meeting at Jeju, the following actions have taken place: 
   
1. A synthesis manuscript is being prepared by Leah Feinberg on pan-Pacific variations in brood sizes of 
Euphausia pacifica based on recent experiments conducted in the southern California Current.  We will 
present results of that effort at the Portland meeting. 
 
2. Requests were made for each WG member to bring to the Portland meeting metadata that describes data 
and publications such that we can discuss types of other synthesis papers we might be able to begin to 
write within the next year. 
 
3. Yuju Okazaki arranged a tour of the Tohoku National Fisheries Research Institute laboratory following 
the Sendai meeting (April 2010). 
   
4. Hal Batchelder arranged a meeting with an Oregon State University librarian and the Peterson lab to 
discuss with her the legal issues with posting pdf files of scientific papers to a WG 23 Website.  She 
suggested we use Zotero [zoh-TAIR-oh] which is a free, easy-to-use Firefox extension to help one 
collect, manage, cite, and share research sources.  According to their web-page, it lives right where you 
do your work—in the web browser itself.  This seems like a good way to share data and publications.  We 
will discuss this in Portland.  Apparently Zotero is able to link citation information which has been 
entered to online electronic archives provided by the publishers, and may serve as the best way for 
providing access to publications. 
   
5. A research cruise with Korean scientists to the Yellow Sea, arranged by Se-Jung Ju for April 2010, had to 
be postponed to a later date as a result of the sinking of the Korean Navy ship. Bill Peterson and Tracy 
Shaw were to participate in this cruise.  
 
6. Bill Peterson was allocated some start-up funds to begin study of pan-Pacific variations in genetic 
structure of our study organisms, Euphausia pacifica.  A recent doctoral student, Mattias Johansson has 
been hired to begin this work.   
 
7. Se-Jung Ju has collected Euphausia pacifica from Korean waters (both east and west sides of Korea) and 
has preserved them in alcohol for later analysis of genetic structure.  Tracy has done the same with 
E. pacifica collected from the Bering Sea so we now have specimens from three widely-separated 
locations. 
  
8. Peterson lab hosted a Chilean graduate student, Ramiro Riquelme, this summer.  We learned from him 
how to do measurements of the hepatopancreas length as a measure of euphausiid condition.  We will 
report on this technique at the WG 23 meeting in Portland with the hope that other members of WG 23 
will adopt this method in their future research. 
 
9. The Peterson lab continues to host a Chinese graduate student, Xiuning Du (from Ocean University of 
China, in Qingdao), who is working on feeding rates and food preferences of Euphausia pacifica through 
microscopic counts of phytoplankton and ciliates removed in control vs feeding containers.  She will be 
giving an oral presentation on her work at the Portland PICES meeting (BIO Session).  
  
10. The Krill Special Issue appeared in April 2010 and those who have seen it have commented that it is 
really nice and well worth the wait.

REPORT OF WORKING GROUP 23 ON COMPARATIVE ECOLOGY OF 
KRILL IN COASTAL AND OCEANIC WATERS AROUND  
THE PACIFIC RIM 
 
 
The Working Group on Comparative Ecology of Krill in Coastal and Oceanic Waters around the Pacific Rim 
(WG 23) held its third meeting on October 24, 2010, from 0900–1230 h under the chairmanship of Dr. 
William Peterson who welcomed the members of the Working Group who were present as well as visitors 
(WG 23 Endnote 1), and shared apologies for those unable to attend.   
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 2 
Agenda additions and/or changes 
 
The Chairman asked if there were any additional change to the agenda.  The only item offered was the need to 
discuss where we could to dinner that evening.  The meeting agenda can be found in WG Endnote 2. 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 3 
Country reports 
 
Reports from each PICES member country on progress during the past year were given.  These reports were to 
include a variety of items including (1) status of metadata describing data which exists (which data can be 
easily shared for synthesis papers); (2) publications to be included in our publications data base; (3) status of 
the idea of having portions of papers written in other languages translated into English; (4) potential for 
collaborative research in the near future; (5) TOR # 5 – status of Working Group members’ work with 
modelers. 
 
Canada  
Dr. David Mackas summarized the extent of krill sampling in Canada, carried out by four programs.  First, the 
ocean sampling that his group has been doing for a number of years was summarized.  This, the “IOS Time 
Series” continues with 3–6 surveys per year, with sampling off southern Vancouver Island, northern 
Vancouver Island and Hecate Strait. Cruises are most often in May/June, August/September, depending on the 
availability of ship time.  Sampling includes bongo tows during both day and night from which biomass per 
square meter is calculated.  Another important time series is the one conducted by Dr. Ron Tanasichuk (Pacific 
Biological Station).  He samples in Barkley Sound, with 10 surveys per year since 1991.  Samples are 
processed chiefly for krill which are catalogued by length, weight, sex, maturity, gonad weights, and larval 
stage.  Third, surveys also take place in the Strait of Georgia.  These have been intermittent since 1968; the 
nighttime samples have been analyzed for euphausiids.  Ms. Moira Galbraith (Institute of Ocean Sciences) 
maintains the database.  Grad student Lingbo Li (University of British Columbia) has been analyzing the data 
from these samples and reports that there appears to be a big drop in the biomass of Euphausia pacifica in 
Strait of Georgia and an increase in Thysanoessa spinifera over the past 10 years. Finally, the cabled 
observatories, the NorthEast Pacific Time-Series Undersea Networked Experiments (NEPTUNE) and the 
Victoria Experimental Network Under the Sea (VENUS) projects include a 125 kHz echosounder (single 
frequency), and “krill” signals are being analyzed by Mei Sato (University of Victoria graduate student) with 
Dr. John Dower (University of Victoria).

Japan  
Dr. Yuki Okazaki reported on several activities.  First, information on the vertical distribution of early life 
stages of E. pacifica was presented at the PICES/ICES/FAO Symposium on “Effects of climate change on fish 
and fisheries” held in Sendai, Japan, in April 2010.  Second, they have begun to do some feeding experiments 
on adult krill during their cruises, with the first experiments carried out in June 2010 in the Oyashio.  In a 
related effort, they will use the Odate/NORPAC net collections to look at eggs and larvae of Euphausia 
pacifica. Pilot studies are underway.  They have also been looking at samples from the A-Line (2001–2008), 
PH Line (1980–2000) and the Saury surveys (2001–2007).  They have found that euphausiid larvae were 
mostly found at stations with a depth of ~100 m and temperature < 12°C.  Larvae were most abundant 
May/June coincident with phytoplankton blooms at that time of the year.  Calyptopis and furcilia densities are 
similar in shelf and offshore waters. For much of this work, collaborations have been initiated with Dr. 
Tomohiko Kikuchi (Yokahama National University) and his PhD student.  It is possible that collaboration will 
soon be established with Dr. Yoshinari Endo (Tohoku University) on krill and climate change.  Finally, Dr. 
Okazaki expressed interest in working with the Peterson lab on population genetics of Euphausia pacifica.  
 
Korea  
Dr. Se-Jung Ju reported that there are many samples available from Korean waters that can be analyzed for 
krill eggs, larvae, juveniles and adults, including bi-monthly samples collected by the NFRDI, since 1968.  
However, he noted that many samples do not look good due to drying out.  KORDI samples the East Sea and 
East China Sea in spring and summer and there are opportunities for others to join these cruises to sample 
euphausiids and to conduct experiments on living animals.  He noted that Korean scientists tried some live 
animal experiments but without much success. They incubated 35 females but only 2 spawned 103 and 136 
eggs per female, respectively. He is also doing lipid analysis on some krill collected from recent cruises.   
 
Dr. Ju also presented an overview of studies of krill life cycles in the Yellow Sea Cold bottom water.  By 
studying the acoustically-derived scatter layer, it was determined that the migration speeds of the krill 
scattering layers were 0.87 m day (downward at dawn) and 0.74 m day (upwards at night) in spring. Rates 
were different during summer: 0.44 m day (down) and 0.49 m day (up) in summer.  In summer they only 
migrated to the base of the mixed layer where the water is still cold and where the Chl maximum is found.  
 
Future work will include studies of the feeding ecology of krill using trophic lipid markers. Acoustics data 
from daytime suggests that adults are living on the bottom during the day. Thus it might be interesting to 
attempt to sample the adults with bottom sampling nets.  Future work will also include two cruises per year, 
spring and summer, and these will involve net tows, acoustics for DVM, and additional lipid work.  
 
To date, Korean scientists have published about 8 papers, 3 of which are in Korean.

AGENDA ITEM 4 
Progress report on Euphausia pacifica synthesis paper  
 
Ms. Leah Feinberg (Oregon State University) presented a report on the synthesis of Euphausia pacifica brood 
sizes.  This paper will be similar to one published in 2006 by Dr. Jaime Gómez-Gutiérrez (CICIMAR) and 
others on Euphausia pacifica where brood size as a function of body length were compared using data from 
Puget Sound (Ross), the Sea of Japan (Iguchi) and Oregon (Peterson lab).  She has updated that paper using 
data from the Oregon coast 2003–2007 (n = 368), the Gulf of Alaska (n = 60), the Southern California 
CalCOFI region (Decima, n = 84), and the Oyashio (Okazaki, n = 59). She has some data from the Yellow Sea 
(from Se-Jung Ju) but is still waiting for some data from Dr. Song Sun (China).  She also needs to standardize 
the lengths (some people use total length, others body length).  She is finding the same dome-shaped 
relationship as before, but with many more data points.  
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 5 
Using Zotero as a way of sharing published papers   
 
WG 23 discussed the use of this tool as a way to store pdf files of published papers and other documents on the 
PICES website.    Dr. Harold Batchelder arranged a meeting with an Oregon State University librarian and the 
Peterson lab to discuss with her the legal issues of posting pdf files of scientific papers to a WG 23 website.  
She suggested using Zotero which is a free, easy-to-use Firefox extension to help users to collect, manage, cite, 
and share research sources.  According to the Zotero webpage (www.zotero.org), it lives right where you do 
your work—in the web browser itself.  Zotero is able to link citation information which has been entered to 
online electronic archives provided by the publishers, and may serve as the best way for providing access to 
publications. WG 23 agreed that the tool seems like a good way to share data and publications.     
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 6 
Status of new project to characterize genetic structure of Euphausia pacifica  
 
At the time of the meeting, it was reported that Dr. Peterson had hired a post-doc at the Hatfield Marine 
Science Center (Dr. Mattias Johansson) to begin some exploratory work on the population genetics of krill. 
Considerable progress has been made and will be reported on at PICES-2011 in Khabarovsk, Russia.   
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 7 
Report on the potential for using measurements of hepato-pancreas size as an index of condition in 
Euphausia pacifica 
 
As with the genetics work, it was reported that we had only the potential to add measurements of the hepato-
pancreas to our tool box.  The Peterson lab hosted a young Chilean scientist, Ramiro Riquelme, during August 
2010 in Newport, to collect living krill during our biweekly cruises and to measure the size of the hepato-
pancreas. We learned that this appears to be a promising index of recent krill growth.    
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 8 
Discussion of TOR # 7   
 
WG 23 discussed whether or not there was enough new information to justify organizing a krill symposium or 
a krill Topic Session for PICES-2011 in Khabarovsk, Russia.  It was decided to not pursue this.

AGENDA ITEM 9 
Summary of mid-term activities 
 
A summary of activities of WG 23 following PICES-2009 in Jeju, Korea, and preceding PICES-2010 is 
reported in the following: 
 
1. A joint Korea–U.S. research cruise was scheduled for April 11–18, 2010 with the purpose of training 
Korean scientists on how do carry out ship-board laboratory studies of krill egg production, molting and 
grazing.  Unfortunately the cruise was cancelled (on April 7) because the research ship was requested to 
help investigate the causes of the sinking of a Korean Navy ship at the end of March.   Ms. Tracy Shaw 
and Dr. Peterson were to have joined this cruise, led by Dr. Se-Jong Ju, all of whom are Working Group 
members.   
 
2. Dr. Peterson was allocated some start-up funds to begin study of pan-Pacific variations in genetic structure 
of our study organisms, Euphausia pacifica.  A recent doctoral student, Mattias Johansson, was hired to 
begin this work. 
 
3. Dr. Ju has collected Euphausia pacifica from Korean waters (both east and west sides of Korea) and has 
preserved them in alcohol for later analysis of genetic structure.  Ms. Shaw has done the same with  
E. pacifica collected from the Bering Sea, so we now have specimens from three widely-separated 
locations.  
 
4. The Peterson lab hosted a Chilean graduate student, Ramiro Riquelme, this summer.  We learned from him 
how to do measurements of hepato-pancreas length as a measure of the euphausiid condition.  [This 
technique was reported on at the WG 23 meeting during PICES-2010 (see Agenda Item 7) with the hope 
that other members of the Group will adopt this method in their future research.] 
 
5. The Peterson lab continues to host Chinese graduate student, Xiuning Du (from Ocean University of 
China, in Qingdao), who is working on feeding rates of Euphausia pacifica through microscopic counts of 
phytoplankton and ciliates removed in control vs. feeding containers.  [She was awarded Best Oral 
Presentation for her talk on “Feeding rates of adult Euphausia pacifica on natural particle assemblages in 
the coastal upwelling zone off Oregon, USA” for a BIO-sponsored Session at PICES-2010.]  
 
6. A special issue of selected papers on krill from the 4
th
 International Zooplankton Production Symposium 
on “Human and climate forcing of zooplankton populations” first appeared online in Deep-Sea Research 
II, and those who have seen it have commented that it is really nice and well worth the wait.  The hard-
copy of the journal was published in April 2010 (Deep-Sea Research II, Vol. 57, Is. 7–8).  Due to the 
untimely death of Dr. Ed Brinton, we decided to dedicate the Krill Special Issue in his honor.  Elsevier 
Press agreed that it was appropriate so Dr. Mark Ohman (Scripps, U.S.A.) and Jaime Farber Lorda 
(CICESE, Mexico) wrote up a brief obituary.  
 
7. Tracy Shaw et al.’s paper on “Growth of Euphausia pacifica in the upwelling zone off the Oregon coast”, 
pp. 584–591, was published in the krill special issue of Deep-Sea Research II in which she summarized 
and synthesized all published growth rate data on Euphausia pacifica. 
 
8. Drs. Peterson and Kazuaki Tadokoro organized a copepod and krill workshop titled, “Examining the 
linkages between physics and fish: how to zooplankton and krill data sets improve our understanding of 
the impacts of climate change on fisheries?” on April 25, 2010 at the PICES/ICES/FAO Symposium on 
“Effects of climate change on fish and fisheries” held in Sendai, Japan.  
 
9. Dr. Yuju Okazaki arranged a tour of the Tohoku National Fisheries Research Institute laboratory following 
the Sendai symposium (April 2010) and, despite the rainy weather on Saturday following the symposium, 
the tour did take place.

Report of Working Group 23 on Comparative Ecology of Krill in Coastal and 
Oceanic Waters around the Pacific Rim 
 
 
The annual meeting of the Working Group on Comparative Ecology of Krill in Coastal and Oceanic Waters 
around the Pacific Rim (WG 23) was convened in Khabarovsk, Russia, at 0900 h on October 16, 2011. Only 6 
of 17 members were able to attend, and 4 observers participated (WG Endnote 1). Most of those who could not 
attend sent their regards to the U.S. Co-Chairman, Dr. William Peterson. The meeting agenda can be found in 
WG 23 Endnote 2. 
 
AGENDA ITEM 2 
Status of posting references and papers 
 
The meeting began with a discussion of the status of posting of references and pdf copies of published papers 
to our ZOTERO web-page.  ZOTERO is a web-based bibliographic site where documents can be stored and 
shared openly with WG members.  The idea is that representatives of the member countries will post 
publications, reports and theses to this website focusing on works available in their own country that are not 
available (or have limited availability) to those from other PICES member countries.  Ms. Tracy Shaw 
established the personal WG 23 page on ZOTERO; she also did a live demonstration of how to access the site 
over the internet, and showed members how to view the content.  Presently there are ~ 125 references listed on 
the site. David Checkley mentioned that they had tried to use ZOTERO in SPACC at the recommendation of 
Dr. Patricio Bernal but they never got going on the idea. 
 
AGENDA ITEM 3 
Country reports 
 
Detailed reports were presented by Japan, Korea and Russia. Each report summarized work carried out during 
the past year along with a comment on status of posting references to ZOTERO and the potential for future 
collaboration on research cruises.  
 
a. Canada  
No report. 
 
b. China  
No report. 
 
c. Japan   
Attempts to improve krill biomass estimates from the MOHT were described and were reported on a poster 
presented at PICES-2011. A major feeding experiment was carried out in June 2010 during which grazing by 
krill and copepods was measured. Clearance rates for krill ranged from 54 to 736 ml per euphausiid-hour. 
Highest filtration rates were on “flagellates”. There are more than 100 papers published by Japanese scientists 
on krill that will soon be posted to ZOTERO.  Sixty-four papers are in English with about an equal number in 
Japanese. What remains is to translate at least the abstract, figure captions and table legends of the more 
important papers written in Japanese. 
 
d. Korea  
Future cruises have been scheduled for April and August 2012–2015. They could include collaborators. Bi-
monthly time series of zooplankton data from 1976 show a gradual increase in zooplankton biomass since 
Appendix 4  WG 23 Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 43  95 
1990 but copepod biomass has declined since 2005. Recent increases in biomass are due to increased biomass 
of salps. A total of approximately 30 on-board live-animal experiments were conducted during cruises in 2010 
and 2011. The brood size of E. pacifica was studied, and research on krill diets based on lipid, stable isotope, 
and gut content was summarized. On two cruises specimens were collected for genetic analysis and were sent 
to the Peterson lab in Newport, Oregon. During the April 2011 cruise, plankton net sampling was carried out 
along with an acoustic survey to derive better estimates of krill biomass. Tracy Shaw (U.S. member of WG 23) 
participated in the August 2011 cruise.   
 
e. Russia   
A summary of the work done by TINRO-Center from 1985–2010 was described. Thousands of plankton 
samples have been collected and processed for biomass of krill and other zooplankton. Information was 
presented on the catchability of different plankton nets, which is necessary to understand so that samples 
collected by different nets can be compared. Overviews of sampling in four regions were provided including 
the total quantity of zooplankton, the role of every taxonomic group in the structure of plankton community, 
the species composition and some information about their biology, features of their spatial distribution, vertical 
distribution, seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of the abundance of major groups, standing stocks of 
zooplankton and estimates of the volumes of zooplankton consumed by nekton. A list of papers by Russian 
scientists that could be added to the ZOTERO web-site was provided. 
  
f. U.S.A.   
The report from the U.S.A. was in the form of a talk by Tracy Shaw on the synthesis paper, “Comparison of 
brood sizes of Euphausia pacifica, pan-Pacific”. This talk generated a debate about the degree to which krill 
were more like fishes than copepods, as suggested by Dr. David Checkley and Peterson.  Dr. Sonia Batten 
described krill as being like chickens. Dr. Peterson reported briefly on progress of a study of the population 
genetics of krill. A graduate student has begun to sequence the DNA of Euphausia pacifica specimens from 
Korea and Oregon.  Results will likely be reported at PICES-2012 in Hiroshima, Japan. 
 
AGENDA ITEM 4 
Presentations 
 
Dr. Michael Dagg reviewed feeding behavior of krill with a focus on Euphausia pacifica and asked the 
question, “What is it about feeding behavior that allows E. pacifica to populate wide-spread regions of the 
North Pacific?” He reviewed the literature on several topics including studies of filter feeding (and mesh size 
of feeding baskets) and gut contents, predatory feeding, the digestive system, gut passage times and 
assimilation efficiency.  Overall, he concluded that E. pacifica is able to eat just about anything 
(phytoplankton, microzooplankton, mesozooplankton, detritus including marine snow and phytodetritus, and 
perhaps benthos), within a broad size range from small (a few mm) to large (copepods) and over a very wide 
range of concentrations – its feeding behavior is flexible, adaptive, and opportunistic. Because it has such 
dietary flexibility and also has the ability to feed over a very wide range of food concentrations, it is seldom 
starving, but because it has such high upper levels of ingestion it is seldom satiated or ‘full’ (i.e., it is almost 
always at least a little hungry).  
 
Xiuning Du is a Ph.D. student from Ocean University in Qingdao, China, who worked in Dr. Peterson’s lab in 
Newport for 1½ years. Among other things, she performed experiments on grazing by adult Euphausia 
pacifica using the “disappearance of particles” technique, both through microscopic counts and “disappearance 
of chlorophll” using size-fractionation of natural seawater and fluorometry. A summary of her work is as 
follows:  selective feeding does occur in E. pacifica. Long-chain diatoms were sometimes avoided when they 
had especially high density.  As for diatom prey, adaptive and opportunistic feeding could be seen; ciliates 
were the preferential prey when they had substantial biomass before the upwelling season or during the decay 
of upwelling blooms.  In the late upwelling season in August, ciliates were preferred though in low abundance, 
likely because of opportunistic feeding or seasonally physiological needs like essential nutrients.  Smaller 
flagellates were positively selected when better foods were lacking. Large dinoflagellates or ciliates were 
predominantly preferred to their smaller types.   Questions were centered on the significance of “selectivity”.

AGENDA ITEM 5 
General Discussion  
 
There was interest by everyone in continuing the Working Group activities, especially the collaborations that 
have been established.  The members present also felt that it would be useful to try to establish a new working 
group. It was suggested that the Working Group Final Report could be used to introduce a new set of questions 
that would form the basis of the new working group.  WG 23 resolved to continue discussions on the potential 
of forming a new working group that would focus on one of two topics: (a) euphausiid vital rates, a topic 
needed to improve models – will require new experimental work, (b) basin-scale comparison of the role small 
pelagics in ecosystems (krill, anchovies and sardines) and how their roles might by modified by a changing 
climate – will require some new thinking.

Krill Biology and Ecology Workshop 
 
by William Peterson, Jaime Gómez-Gutiérrez, Angus Atkinson and Bettina Meyer 
The final official gathering of the international GLOBEC 
scientific community was held from June 22–26, 2009, in 
Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, at the Victoria Conference 
Center, a venue well known to most PICES scientists.  The 
five-day meeting included 10 workshops on the first two 
days followed by three days of invited and contributed 
talks and posters.  This report summarizes activities at the 
two-day workshop on “Krill Biology and Ecology in the 
World’s Oceans” co-convened by the authors of this article. 
 
The idea for this workshop originated at a workshop with a 
similar title that was held at the PICES/ICES/GLOBEC 4
th
 
Zooplankton Production Symposium in May 2007, in 
Hiroshima (Japan).  More than one hundred krill enthusiasts 
at this workshop endorsed the need to meet more regularly, 
thus Drs. So Kawaguchi and Bill Peterson proposed to 
GLOBEC that another workshop be held at the 3
rd
 and final 
GLOBEC Open Science Meeting.  The proposal was 
approved and planning began in earnest.  The Victoria 
workshop marked the sixth time that krill biologists had 
assembled for the specific purpose of discussing krill 
biology and ecology, with the first two being held in 
Wilmington (North Carolina, U.S.A.) and Bremerhaven 
(Germany) in 1982 and 1983.  After a long pause, regular 
gatherings took place with the third and fourth meetings in 
Santa Cruz (California, U.S.A.) in 1999 and Nagoya (Japan) 
in 2002.  The Hiroshima meeting was the fifth.  Discussions 
are underway to propose a seventh meeting in Pucón (Chile) 
as part of the forthcoming PICES/ICES 5
th
 Zooplankton 
Production Symposium to be convened in 2011. 
 
Krill Biology and Ecology Workshop in session. 
 
The purpose of the krill workshop was fourfold.  Firstly, 
the conveners recognized the need for those working on 
different euphausiid species to get together to discuss 
methods/approaches that have proved effective for one 
species to see if they could be applied to other euphausiid 
species.  Secondly, we wanted to make sure that there was 
a degree of harmony (or at least that there was no serious 
disconnect) in research approaches, recognizing the need to 
improve technical aspects of specific methods where 
necessary.  Thirdly, we wanted to generate ideas for future 
collaborations (laboratory/seagoing exchanges of personnel 
and exchange and pooling of datasets to address broad-
scale issues).  Finally, we proposed to produce a tangible 
product, to show where krill research is at the moment, and 
to identify hurdles to progress and potential solutions.  It 
was agreed that “the krill workshop group” will produce a 
summary paper for consideration of publication in the 
Marine Ecology Progress Series. 
 
Towards these ends, on the first day (June 22), 16 
presentations were made which summarized national 
programs – 9 talks on work in the Antarctic mostly focused 
on the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba by scientists from 
the UK, Germany, Australia, Korea and the USA and 7 
talks on work carried out in the Pacific (in Peru/Chile, 
Mexico, USA, Canada, Japan, China and Korea).  At least 
five common themes emerged from the discussions: 
1. The biomass of all krill species has likely been 
underestimated, and thus there is a need to make better 
use of acoustics and large plankton nets in order to 
derive proper estimates of krill biomass; 
2. We need to gain a better appreciation of the role of 
krill as predators and prey in marine food webs, 
especially with regards to krill as a “wasp-waist” 
species (e.g., Euphausia superba, E. pacifica and 
Meganyctiphanes norvegica) – by definition, such 
species occupy an intermediate trophic level that is 
strongly dominated by a single species with large 
fluctuations in biomass such that their prey and 
predators are measurably impacted by the large swings 
in biomass; 
3. We only have a very rudimentary knowledge of krill 
behavior and the factors which result in krill forming 
schools, aggregations and patches at multiple time–
space scales and its role in energy cost, physiological 
adaptation mechanisms to a strong seasonal 
environment such as the Southern Ocean, species 
condition and parasite transmission; 
Appendix 5  PICES Press Article 
PICES Scientific Report No. 43  99 
4. We need much more pan-oceanic research which will 
allow us to work out the impact of climate variability 
and change on krill ecology and production at different 
latitudinal ecosystems – on this topic, there is abundant 
evidence that the Antarctic waters are warming and that 
the ice sheet is melting, two processes that are certain to 
impact krill but in ways that we can only guess; and  
5. Vast improvements have been made using IBM 
models linked with ROMS (Regional Ocean Model 
System) to gain a better understanding of krill population 
dynamics and of how eggs of broadcast spawning species 
and larvae are transported as a result of interaction of 
currents with ontogenic variations in vertical distributions. 
 
Talks were supplemented by 17 posters that summarized 
topics such as larval development and growth, maturation, 
secondary production, parasitism, analysis of exploitation 
strategies, effect of global warming, grazing rates, 
variations in digestive enzymes, lipid trophic markers and 
larval drift modeling in different regions in the Southern 
Ocean and Pacific Ocean. 
 
The second day (June 23) included talks on four hot topics 
such as novel uses of bottom mounted  upward facing 
echo-sounders and high-speed video systems to study krill 
behaviour and hydrodynamics of swimming and krill 
patchiness, estimation of mortality rates of Euphausia 
pacifica, and a comparison of the role of krill as prey in the 
Antarctic and North Pacific ecosystems.  The remainder of 
this day was devoted to discussions of the structure of a 
synthesis paper that will be prepared for the Marine 
Ecology Progress Series.  This will be one tangible output 
from the workshop, in which we will introduce krill as 
“wasp-waist” species in important productive ecosystems 
around the world.  The paper will highlight recent 
developments and issues in krill biology, improving our 
understanding of how this group fit into their ecosystems. 
 
Perhaps 50 people from at least 11 nations attended the 
workshop for the two full days whereas another 50 attended 
one or more of the talks on the first day.  Members of the 
PICES Working Group on Comparative Ecology of Krill in 
Coastal and Oceanic Waters around the Pacific Rim were 
well represented by talks by Bill Peterson, Dave Mackas, 
Yuji Okazaki, Song Sun, Hyoung Chul Shin, Leah Feinberg 
and Jarrod Santora. 
 
The workshop was concluded by a power point presentation 
prepared by Dr. Jaime Gómez-Gutiérrez which honored the 
life-time achievements of three distinguished krill biologists, 
Edward Brinton and Margaret Knight (from Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography) and John Mauchline (from the 
Scottish Association of Marine Science, Oban, Dunstaffnage 
Laboratory).  Each received a “commemorative diploma”, a 
copy of a krill video and a fetching krill “paper weight” 
made by Lisa Roberts (see below).  Each of these scientists 
was a pioneer in early work on krill:  Ed Brinton for work 
on zoogeography, taxonomy and ecology of krill 
throughout the Pacific Ocean; Margaret Knight for work on 
krill larvae taxonomy, including descriptions of the larvae 
of 13 euphausiid species, and John Mauchline for his 
research and periodic landmark reviews in Advances in

Marine Biology on the biology and ecology of krill 
worldwide still considered core texts of euphausiid biology.  
Tarsicio Antezana (Chile) had the original idea to do this 
tribute and wrote an informal, sometimes humoristic, poetic 
text to remember the legacy of Ed and Margaret.  
Unfortunately our friend Tarsicio was unable to attend the 
workshop. 
 
The workshop included some outreach materials produced 
by Lisa Roberts, a Ph.D. student from College of Fine Arts, 
University of New South Wales, who produced both our 
“krill logo” and an animation named Antarctic Energies 
which was shown during the workshop breaks and during 
the poster session.  Lisa’s delightful and fascinating videos 
can be viewed at http://www.antarcticanimation.com/ 
content/animation/energies/energies.php.  The video 
Antarctic Energies was inspired by Lisa after she 
traveled to the Southern Ocean on board the R/V Aurora 
Australis and saw schooling krill alive in the Australian 
Antarctic Division Krill Laboratory in Tasmania and 
heard the insights of scientists who breed them..  
Antarctic Energies represents physical and biological 
forces that interact to shape Antarctica:  diatoms, krill, sea

A “Krill logo” designed by Lisa Roberts. 
 
An evening social at the Irish Times pub was attended by 
about 50 krill biologists and ecologists, where many krill 
stories were exchanged by all, but most importantly, 
new, exciting and fruitful collaborations were 
established. Without a doubt, these two days were truly 
an unforgettable bonding experience for everyone. 
 
 
    
Dr. William (Bill) Peterson (bill.peterson@noaa.gov) is an oceanographer and zooplankton ecologist at the Hatfield Marine Science 
Center in Newport, Oregon.  He works for NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service, and his research focuses on climate effects on 
zooplankton, particularly euphausiids and copepods.  Recently his lab has made advances in the business of forecasting the return rates 
of salmon to their natal streams one year in advance.  Within PICES, Bill has served on several expert groups and is currently a member 
of the Biological Oceanography Committee and Co-Chairman of the Working Group on Comparative Ecology of Krill in Coastal and 
Oceanic Waters around the Pacific Rim. 
Dr. Jaime Gómez-Gutiérrez (jagomezg@ipn.mx) is a Biological Oceanographer at Centro Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Marinas 
(Instituto Politécnico Nacional) at La Paz B.C.S., Mexico. His research focuses on the biology and ecology of zooplankton and 
micronekton in the epipelagic ecosystem, particularly studying since 1990 euphausiid diel vertical distribution with hydroacoustic and 
submarine video cameras, secondary productivity, ecophysiology, and parasitism. He was part of the 15 authors of the PICES Science 
Report No. 30 entitled: Micronekton of the North Pacific. During 2008-2009 he did a sabbatical research at the Australian Antarctic 
Division at Kingston Tasmania, Australia working on a review of euphausiid parasites with Steve Nicol and So Kawaguchi. He did a 
PhD thesis at Oregon State University working in several GLOBEC research projects studying euphausiid embryonic development rates, 
hatching mechanisms, reproductive effort, and parasitism of Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera along the Washington-
Oregon-California coasts. 
Dr. Angus Atkinson (aat@bas.ac.uk) works at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK.  He is fond of all kinds of invertebrates 
(even terrestrial ones – see photo), but his real love is Antarctic krill.  He started working on krill by accident in 1996 (there were not 
any amphipods to work on but loads of krill instead) and has worked on them ever since.  Topics include feeding, excretion, defecation 
and growth, and more recently large scale distribution.  All of this involves a healthy amount of labwork and experimentation on live 
animals, and Angus has now participated in 15 Antarctic cruises. 
Dr. Bettina Meyer (bettina.meyer@awi.de) is a Marine Biologist at the Alfred-Wegener Institute of Polar and Marine Research (AWI, 
Germany).  She worked on trophic interaction and the seasonal variability in ecophysiological condition on planktonic crustaceans.  
Since 1999 her research focuses on the physiology of Antarctic krill, the mechanisms causing synchronization between the seasonal 
development of krill and the seasonal cycles of environmental features in particular.  She has been initiated the LAKRIS project (Lazarev 
Sea Krill Study), the German contribution to the Southern Ocean GLOBEC program.
