The North Pacific Marine Science Organization 
(PICES) celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2001. 
To mark this occasion, the Science Board topic 
was chosen as “Ten years of PICES science: 
Decadal-scale scientific progress and prognosis for 
a regime shift in scientific approach”. This 
symposium was held on October 8, 2001, at the 
opening of the Tenth Annual Meeting of PICES, 
in Victoria, Canada.  Nine papers were presented 
during this session, eight of which are included in 
this volume. 
 
The symposium was designed as a celebration and 
reflection on the first ten years of scientific 
progress by PICES, and to provide a look to the 
future of the marine sciences in the North Pacific. 
Current or recent Chairmen of the Scientific 
Committees of PICES (see Figure 1 for a diagram 
of the organizational structure of PICES) were 
invited to review the history and major  
accomplishments of their Committees, and to look 
forward to critical issues and concerns for the 
future.  Each of these “disciplinary” presentations 
was followed by an invited presentation, often by 
someone not normally associated with PICES, 
which took a broad view of the grand themes, 
issues and challenges facing that discipline.  This 
format provides an interesting dialogue between 
where PICES is now and how it got here, and 
where it could/should go in the future.  
 
In the first paper Warren S. Wooster, as one of the 
principal founders of PICES and its first 
Chairman, provides an overall history of the 
events leading to the formation of the organization 
and its major accomplishments.  He also suggests 
future extensions of PICES’ role in the North 
Pacific, including possibly providing more specific 
information or advice to policy makers on the state 
of the North Pacific Ocean.

Paul H. LeBlond reviews the history of the 
Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee 
(POC), and comments on POC’s potential role in 
developing marine operational modelling.  D. E. 
Harrison and Neville Smith provide a 
complementary view on the significance and 
importance of the future of ocean prediction and 
forecasts.   
 
Tsutomu Ikeda and Patricia A. Wheeler review the 
history of the Biological Oceanography 
Committee (BIO).  They distil three primary 
themes from the past ten years of PICES activities 
in biological oceanography:  (1) regional and 
basin-scale comparisons of lower and upper 
trophic levels;  (2) the importance of life history 
strategies, alternate food webs, and understudied 
groups of organisms;  and (3) the roles of trace 
metals and biogeochemical cycling.  The 
“independent” broad overview is presented by 
Timothy R. Parsons, who provides a critical and 
thought-provoking commentary on the maturity of 
biological oceanography as a branch of the marine 
sciences, and what is needed to help it to mature.  
 
Douglas E. Hay et al. have written a critical 
review of the role played by the Fishery Science 
Committee (FIS) in helping to understand changes 
in fish populations in the North Pacific.  They 
conclude that while the FIS Committee has done 
an excellent job at facilitating communication of 
fisheries science around the Pacific, its 
contribution to initiating collaborative scientific 
projects regarding the health of fisheries and 
mechanisms affecting the abundance of living 
marine resources has been more marginal.  Hay et 
al. discuss a theme that is repeated in a number of 
the presentations from the Scientific Committees: 
that some committees have concentrated on 
enhancing communication of science (for example 
through symposia at the PICES Annual Meetings), 
whereas others have also emphasized developing 
new collaborative scientific activities. 
 
One committee, which has focussed on the latter 
aspect (while not ignoring the former), is the 
Marine Environmental Quality Committee (MEQ). 
Richard F. Addison et al. describe the events 
leading to their hosting of a practical workshop on 
comparisons and development of common 
assessment methodologies for marine 
environmental quality problems.  This paper is 
followed by Macdonald et al., who present a very 
thorough review of the stresses on the North 
Pacific marine system, how these should be 
studied, and how PICES might contribute to their 
study and to understanding their significance.   
 
The final paper in this symposium (and in this 
volume) is by Perry et al., who examine the 
history, objectives, accomplishments and problems 
of the primary inter-disciplinary program of 
PICES, the Climate Change and Carrying 
Capacity (CCCC) Program.  This program was 
designed and implemented to bridge across the 
four “disciplinary” committees of PICES, and to 
specifically engage and consciously involve 
physical and biological oceanographers, fishery 
scientists and, though to a lesser extent, marine 
environmental quality scientists in an integrated 
program to study one of the major drivers of 
change in the North Pacific:  climate change. 
 
A map of the PICES area (Fig. 2) identifies key 
geographic features and locations mentioned in the 
papers included in this volume.  In addition, an 
Appendix at the end of the volume deciphers the 
numerous acronyms referred to in these papers.

The accomplishments and products from PICES 
research activities are still being produced, and 
many more have yet to appear.  PICES has 
recently been very successful at publishing the 
papers presented in the many symposia and 
sessions during its Annual Meetings in special 
volumes or sections of established scientific 
journals.  This has greatly helped the 
dissemination of “PICES science”, and the marine 
sciences generally, in the North Pacific.  Over the 
first ten years, scientists of the PICES member 
nations have learnt to work together productively, 
as evidenced by the many reports of PICES 
Working Groups and multi-authored papers cited 
in the reviews in this volume.  The challenge for 
PICES in the next decade is to move beyond a 
focus on scientific communications into a defining 
role of the principal scientific issues in the North 
Pacific, and perhaps into providing consensus 
scientific advice on critical marine problems 
facing the nations of the North Pacific.  If the past 
can be used to predict the future, it should be a 
very active and exciting next ten years for PICES.

While PICES celebrates its tenth anniversary, its 
origins can be traced back more than 25 years. 
Early informal discussions of the need for such an 
organization took place at an FAO Technical 
Conference on Fishery Management in Vancouver 
in 1973.  More active consideration began at the 
University of Washington in 1976, and the first 
informal meeting on the subject occurred in 1978. 
Between then and March 1992, when the PICES 
Convention was signed, there were 8 other 
informal and formal reunions, involving 
participants from most of the present member 
countries.  While some time was required to 
develop mutual understanding of what such an 
organization could accomplish, the long gestation 
period was mostly due to the shifting political 
relations among the countries concerned. 
 
Early in the discussions, it became clear that 
interests of the proposed organization would not 
overlap with those of international organizations 
operating in the region.  These were either global 
and broad in scope, or regional and specialized, in 
most cases for fishery management. PICES was 
envisioned as a regional organization, similar in 
many ways to the International Council for the 
Exploration of the Sea, ICES, in the North 
Atlantic, and was to be devoted to marine science 
in its broad aspects, and particularly to the 
interactions between the physical ocean 
environment and the ecosystems that function 
therein.  This focus became particularly relevant as 
the impact of climate variations and the threat of 
climate change became apparent. 
 
In its first decade, PICES considered a wide array 
of problems, including those of specific regions, 
such as the Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio region, the 
Bering Sea, the subarctic gyre, and the Japan/East 
Sea;  circulation modeling, carbon dioxide, and the 
iron fertilization experiment; monitoring, data 
exchange and quality control;  pollution 
assessment methodology;  coastal pelagic 
fisheries, marine birds and mammals, crabs and 
shrimps, and harmful algal blooms.  The major 
program on Climate Change and Carrying 
Capacity incorporates an interdisciplinary, 
integrative, and comparative approach, 
encompasses estimations of ecosystem carrying 
capacity and will shed light on the implications of 
climate changes for fisheries management.  These 
efforts continue as the problems evolve and new 
ones arise. 
 
The coming decade may include more cooperative 
operational efforts, for example, in establishing an 
effective ecosystem monitoring system, and in 
data and information exchange and analysis in 
order to generate regular and timely ecosystem 
status reports, and to provide scientific assessment 
and advice to its members and to interested 
regional organizations.  The goal of PICES should 
be to continue and enhance services to its 
members and to their scientists.  
 
This may be the first PICES meeting for some, 
while others can trace their connection back to the 
dim past when PICES was struggling to be born. 
While we speak of the first decade, the actual 
history, from the first gleam in its parents’ eyes to 
the present, covers more than 25 years.  If I outline 
some of that history, it may help to understand the 
present personality of the Organization and to 
foretell where it might be going. 
 
Marine research is accomplished in large part by 
marine scientists whose specialties reflect the 
broad and interwoven nature of the ocean, whose 
approaches range from the abstract to the applied, 
and whose sponsors include universities, 
government agencies and private corporations.  
 
Since the physical and biological processes that 
operate in the ocean recognize no man-made 
boundaries, marine research is inherently an 
international as well as interdisciplinary 
undertaking.  In studying a complex system like 
the ocean, cooperation among scientists of 
  
different persuasions is always complicated, and 
even more so when they come from different 
countries and cultures with different languages.  
The need for successful cooperative efforts has led 
to the establishment of international organizations 
to facilitate those efforts.  Of those organizations 
concerned to a significant degree with some aspect 
of marine science, one can distinguish two 
principal categories, that of non-governmental and 
that of intergovernmental character, with each 
having its special focus and motivation, e.g., 
science or resource management, and its 
geographical scale, e.g., global or regional. 
 
To come quickly to the bottom line, PICES is 
regional and intergovernmental with a broad 
interest in advancing scientific knowledge of the 
ocean.  In the course of its development, these 
characteristics were all negotiated, and the 
decisions drew upon the player's experience with 
global organizations (e.g., Intergovernmental 
Oceanographic Commission, IOC and the Food 
and Agriculture Organization, FAO) and with 
regional specialized bodies (e.g., International 
North Pacific Fisheries Commission, INPFC). 
Particular note was taken of the long success of an 
analogous organization in the North Atlantic, the 
International Council for the Exploration of the 
Sea, ICES.  While the designers drew heavily on 
the ICES experience, they were also well aware of 
the significant geographical and political 
differences between the two regions. 
 
When I moved to Seattle, in 1976, I was 
challenged by two colleagues, Don McKernan and 
Lee Alverson, to think about developing a new 
international organization to support the scientific 
investigation of the North Pacific, a sort of Pacific 
ICES (hence the nickname PICES).  The first 
informal meeting to discuss the need for such an 
organization, was held in early 1978 and involved 
scientists from Canada and the United States.  At 
the second such meeting a year later, participants 
from Japan and the USSR were included.  Then 
there was a long delay, for a variety of reasons that 
reflected the international politics of the time. 
 
Not until April 1986, were the next international 
discussions held, when participants from the four 
countries were joined by observers from China.  
The pace then quickened. Not only were 
discussions more frequent, but they were more 
formal and among governments rather than just 
among interested individuals.  By December 1989, 
the convention was drafted and a year later was 
accepted.  Following an intergovernmental 
organizational meeting in March 1992, PICES was 
ready to hold its first Annual Meeting ten years 
ago, in Victoria, B.C., in October of that year.  
Russia replaced the USSR, and Korea soon 
became the sixth member state. 
 
Rather than regaling readers with anecdotes from 
this long gestation period, I think it would be more 
useful to examine early aspirations, to compare 
them with accomplishments to date and to 
speculate on where this might all lead. 
 
When the first informal meeting occurred, the Law 
of the Sea (LOS) negotiations were still underway 
and coastal states were preparing to assume 
jurisdiction over coastal waters, both for resource 
exploitation and for research.  These 
circumstances flavored the questions addressed, 
such as the following: 
 
• Who are the participants in marine scientific 
research in the North Pacific, and how do they 
interact politically and scientifically?  What 
are their objectives in seeking cooperation 
and/or coordination of marine scientific 
research in the region? 
• What are appropriate functions for the 
proposed scientific organization?  How should 
the region of interest be defined?  Should 
membership in the proposed organization be 
restricted to countries bordering the region?  
Are there existing international organizations 
that could carry out the functions proposed for 
the new organization? 
• What international arrangements for 
consultation on fishery matters are likely to 
survive the LOS negotiations, and to what 
extent are they likely to carry out the functions 
of the proposed organization?  What should be 
the role of the proposed organization with 
regard to the formulation of advice to member 
governments or to appropriate regional 
organizations?  Can such advice be responsive 
to the collective requirements of members and 
yet be effectively insulated from political 
influence? 
  
It seems curious now that so much concern was 
expressed at the meeting over consultation on 
fishery matters and on providing advice to 
member governments when the original impetus 
had centered mostly on cooperative scientific 
investigation.  But the purpose of the new 
organization as proposed then will not sound 
strange to you: 
 
• To promote the development of cooperative 
research activities and the exchange of 
information concerning (1) the North Pacific 
marine environment and its interactions with 
land and atmosphere, (2) uses of the North 
Pacific and its living and non-living resources, 
and (3) the effects of man’s activities on the 
quality of the marine environment. 
 
These goals would be achieved through exchange 
of data and information;  review of research plans, 
programs, and progress;  identification of critical 
research problems and of methods appropriate for 
their solution;  planning, development, and 
coordination of cooperative investigations of 
problems of common interest;  and evaluation and 
interpretation of available data and information 
from the scientific point of view. 
 
When, after eleven years, a meeting was held to 
draft the PICES Convention, a spokesman for the 
United States Delegation opened discussion on the 
continuing need for the organization: 
 
The need for a PICES has not diminished in the 
last year.  Potential conflicts and uncertainties in 
how to respond to contentious questions in the 
northern North Pacific have arisen in large part 
from lack of scientific understanding of the issues 
involved.  These issues are difficult and complex.  
Their consideration often requires data not 
generally available as well as the exchange and 
pooling of ideas among scientists that is now 
difficult to achieve, in part because some existing 
scientific institutions are tied to management 
responsibilities so that relevant data are not 
exchanged freely nor analysed objectively.  
Existing organizations tend to be narrowly 
conceived so that all dimensions of problems 
cannot be examined (i.e., they are mono- rather 
than multi-disciplinary), or they are so broad in 
membership and scope that their attention to a 
single region, especially one in high northern 
latitudes, is only transitory at best. 
 
The general characteristics of PICES were soon 
agreed, and the draft Convention was accepted in 
late 1990.  A few months before the organizational 
meeting, in early 1992, a scientific workshop was 
held in Seattle to review the state of knowledge in 
selected fields, to list relevant ongoing research, to 
identify research gaps and priorities, and to 
consider joint action that might be developed 
through PICES.  Several Working Groups (WG) 
were set up to consider selected topics. 
 
The climate change group sought a description of 
the changing climate that would elucidate the 
processes involved and allow for prediction of the 
evolution of the physical and biological system.  
The Bering Sea group proposed studies of the 
relationships and variability among components of 
the physical and biological environment with 
regard to circulation, productivity, and biological 
interactions.  The fishery oceanography group 
asked what governs fish resources, species, 
composition, and biomass in the North Pacific and 
Bering Sea and emphasized the importance of 
interactions among organisms and between them 
and the physical environment.  Finally, the 
environmental quality group discussed problems 
of nutrient loading and eutrophication, the fate of 
chronic and persistent chemical pollutants, and the 
role of the North Pacific in waste disposal, in 
terms of environmental changes and ecosystem 
responses. 
 
These discussions all converged on a common 
scientific problem: 
 
• What is the nature of the subarctic Pacific 
ecosystem (or ecosystems) and how is it 
affected over periods of months to centuries 
by changes in the physical environment, by 
interactions among components of the 
ecosystem, and by human activities? 
• So what is an appropriate way to assess PICES 
accomplishments in respect to the scientific 
questions mapped out nearly ten years ago? 
 
One approach is to identify specific activities and 
products.  From the beginning, there have been 
four standing Scientific Committees, in biological 
  
oceanography (BIO), fishery science (FIS), marine 
environmental quality (MEQ), and physical 
oceanography and climate (POC).  From these 
have arisen temporary Working Groups that are 
disbanded when their tasks are completed.  The 
sixteen established until now have looked at 
various aspects of the problems identified in 1991 
with topics ranging from a specific sub-region, the 
Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio Region, to the broad 
questions of climate change, shifts in fish 
production, and fisheries management (Table 1). 
 
Two major issues have been addressed by special, 
more permanent bodies, both of them established 
in 1994.  Data exchange has always been seen as a 
central and continuing issue in cooperative 
research, especially that on very large systems 
where pooling of information is essential.  The 
incorporation of biological data, ranging from tiny 
plankton to enormous whales, presents particular 
problems.  An early Working Group has evolved 
into a standing Technical Committee on Data 
Exchange, TCODE.  In addition to reviewing 
technical aspects of data exchange, TCODE has 
identified and made available on the PICES web 
site an inventory of the major ocean databases in 
the subarctic Pacific. 
 
The second continuing body arose during 
discussions on the possibility that more juvenile 
salmon were being pumped into the ocean from 
hatcheries than could be sustained by the 
ecosystem where they were feeding.  In other 
words, the carrying capacity of the system for 
salmon was being challenged.  In response, it was 
decided to create what has become a major 
research program on Climate Change and Carrying 
Capacity, CCCC (a.k.a. the Four Seas), in 
cooperation with the international GLOBEC 
program (Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics). 
CCCC has an Implementation Panel and Task 
Teams on the basin scale component, regional 
scale studies, and development of 
conceptual/theoretical and modeling studies.  
Subsequently a Task Team on monitoring was 
added.  The CCCC Program is a major effort to 
wrestle with many of the scientific questions 
identified back in 1991. 
 
Another measure of PICES activity is the list of 
subjects discussed in scientific sessions of the 
Annual Meetings.  These have steadily increased 
in number, from the single major symposium on 
climate change and northern fish populations at 
the First Annual Meeting to the eleven symposia 
and topic sessions at the present meeting.  These 
have covered all the topics of interest to the 
standing Scientific Committees plus others of 
broader scope identified by the Science Board. 
From my count, some 60 topics will have been 
highlighted by the end of PICES X (Table 2). 
 
A major scientific conference in March 2000 was 
entitled “Beyond El Niño” and concerned climate 
variability and marine ecosystem impacts, from 
the tropics to the Arctic.  This not only had the 
interdisciplinary and ecosystem approach that has 
characterized PICES from the beginning, but was 
a first cooperative effort with four international 
fishery commissions in the North Pacific, those 
that deal with management of tropical (IATTC) 
and extra-tropical tuna (ISCTNP), Pacific halibut 
(IPHC), and high seas salmon (NPAFC). 
 
Yet another measure of PICES scientific activity 
has been its scientific publications, not only the 19 
scientific reports arising mostly from Working 
Groups but also several substantial monographs. 
These include a large volume (739 pages) on 
climate change and northern fish populations that 
resulted from the 1992 PICES I symposium, a 
major synopsis on the Bering Sea, and special 
volumes of Progress in Oceanography on 
ecosystem dynamics in the eastern and western 
gyres of the subarctic Pacific, and on North Pacific 
climate regime shifts.  These will soon be joined 
by papers from the “Beyond El Niño” symposium 
(Table 3). 
 
I think it is reasonable to argue that the majority of 
these activities and products arose or became 
evident through the efforts of PICES.  Of course, 
there would likely have been some cooperative 
and collective activities as there were in the past, 
and the marine scientific world was already 
moving towards ecosystem approaches and inter-
disciplinarity – we did not invent the idea back in 
1978!  But I have serious doubts that anything 
close to the breadth of interest and involvement 
displayed by PICES members in the last ten years 
and evident at the present meeting could have 
occurred had the Organization not existed. 
  
What next?  I understand that the government of 
Mexico is seriously considering membership.  
This will of course increase our geographical, but 
more important, our intellectual coverage.  The 
coming decade is likely to see an expansion of 
cooperative operational efforts, for example, in 
establishing an effective ecosystem monitoring 
system and in data and information exchange and 
analysis.  This could lead to the generation of 
regular and timely ecosystem status reports that 
could be provided to PICES members and to 
interested regional organizations. 
 
These reports would incorporate climate, 
oceanographic, and fisheries data from national 
and other sources and would include descriptions 
of the current state of the ecosystem and recent 
and longer-term changes therein, including the 
abundance and distribution of various of its 
biological components.  To the extent possible, 
now-casts and forecasts of probable future 
conditions would be made and widely distributed. 
 
Until now, PICES members, unlike those of ICES, 
have shunned any sort of advisory capacity for 
PICES, largely because of fishery politics in the 
region.  However, I believe that once PICES has 
developed its periodic ecosystem status reports, 
their availability will constitute a form of useful, 
yet apolitical, advice that members will welcome. 
This service could be a significant contribution to 
member governments as PICES pursues its 
continuing efforts “to promote and coordinate 
marine scientific research in order to advance 
scientific knowledge of the area concerned and of 
its living resources”.

The birth of POC 
 
International scientific organizations have a long 
gestation period;  they are eventually carried to a 
successful birth by repeated emphasis on the need 
for their existence.  Discussions leading to the 
creation of PICES lasted over fifteen years (W. S. 
Wooster, PICES Press 1(1), 1992).  Before the 
first formal PICES Annual Meeting, before the 
Convention for a North Pacific Marine Science 
Organization entered into force on March 24, 
1992, a Scientific Workshop was convened in 
Seattle at the invitation of the United States 
(December 11-13, 1991).  The purpose of the 
workshop was to review the state of knowledge, to 
identify gaps and priorities, and to consider where 
joint action under the new PICES convention 
would be most appropriate. 
 
Four topics were selected for discussion at the 
workshop:  climate change, the Bering Sea, 
environmental quality and fisheries oceanography.  
It is easy to recognize in these topics, with some 
modification, the origin of the four Scientific 
Committees of PICES.  The issues debated by the 
Climate Change working group are clearly 
reflected in future concerns of the Physical 
Oceanography and Climate Committee (POC).  
The principal scientific question identified then 
was “to obtain a description of the climate change 
in such a way that the processes involved in 
climate change can be understood”.  Participants 
emphasized the need for easier and freer data 
exchange among North Pacific Rim countries, and 
also concluded that the “present exchange of ideas 
is not adequate”.  Participants also stressed the 
need for joint investigations and collaboration 
within existing international programs (e.g., 
WOCE, JGOFS). 
 
The existing Scientific Committees of PICES 
(BIO, FIS, MEQ, POC) emerged from the 
workshop discussion groups and were first 
provisionally established at the organizational 
meetings in March 1992, and confirmed as  
permanent committees at PICES II, in October 
1993.  In the words of our first Chairman:  “These 
committees are more disciplinary-oriented than the 
discussion topics were, and reflected the 
experience of ICES which had found that 
committees centered on specific disciplines 
provided a home for specialists in those 
disciplines.  The trick then was to get the 
committees to work together on interdisciplinary 
topics of common interest, leading to joint 
sessions and symposia.  This is certainly the 
current practice in PICES. “ (W. Wooster, priv. 
com. June 12, 2001). 
 
It did not take long for POC to begin its work in 
earnest. At the First Annual Meeting (PICES I, 
Victoria, October 1992), Dr. Yutaka Nagata 
(Japan) was elected Chairman of the Committee.  
That meeting set the tone for POC’s work in the 
years to come:  an open and friendly forum, where 
ideas were welcome and seriously debated, and 
where exploration and understanding of the ocean 
was always the primary goal.  Members agreed 
that one of POC’s most important roles should be 
to facilitate collaboration in international scientific 
programs.  They also identified four important 
topics to be addressed through the formation of 
Working Groups:  ocean circulation and climate 
variability in the Subarctic Pacific;  the Okhotsk 
Sea and the Oyashio Region;  new technologies 
and observing strategies;  and data collection and 
quality control.  These topics have provided the 
main focus for POC’s deliberations over the years.  
 
Circulation of the North Pacific 
 
Understanding the circulation of North Pacific 
waters as well as the nature of its variability is 
clearly a theme of common interest and great 
importance to all PICES members.  At the very 
first PICES Annual Meeting, the Science Board 
created an interdisciplinary, inter-committee 
Working Group (WG 6) on the Subarctic Gyre, 
with the task of reviewing current description and 
understanding of ocean circulation and climate 
  
variability in the subarctic North Pacific, 
identifying gaps, reviewing information on the 
biomass of major trophic levels - with special 
reference to carrying capacity for salmon - as well 
as reviewing the state of understanding of 
processes affecting primary and secondary 
production.  Quite a task! 
 
In addition, WG 6 was to identify key scientific 
questions and propose collaborative programs to 
advance knowledge and test major hypotheses.  As 
much of the above was also the realm of interest of 
the international GLOBEC program, the Working 
Group was to advise which PICES and GLOBEC 
objectives could be linked.  
 
The work of WG 6 gave rise to a variety of 
questions about the functioning of the subarctic 
Pacific ecosystem.  It stimulated further interest on 
the part of POC, which convened a scientific 
session on “Ocean circulation and climate 
variability” at PICES II and launched a Working 
Group (WG 7) on Modelling of the subarctic 
North Pacific circulation at the same meeting.  
WG 7 was to review the state of the art in physical 
modelling, identify gaps as well as the kind of 
information required to improve circulation 
models.  This Working Group, co-chaired by Drs. 
Paul LeBlond (Canada) and Masahiro Endoh 
(Japan), brought together leading ocean modelers 
in meetings in Vancouver (June 1994) and at 
PICES III in Nemuro (October 1994).  A final 
report was presented to POC at PICES IV in 1995, 
and published as PICES Scientific Report No. 5.   
 
A number of conclusions and recommendations 
were made by WG 7 to improve the results of 
numerical modeling.  The unavailability of high 
resolution bathymetric data, especially in 
strategically sensitive coastal areas, was found to 
be a limitation on the accuracy of coastal 
circulation models.  More comprehensive ocean 
property atlases were felt to be needed and better 
quality and availability of meteorological 
information was deemed crucial to ocean 
modeling.  The Working Group also expressed 
strong support for satellite-based ocean observing 
missions.  Workshops on modeling, to familiarize 
the PICES community with model results and their 
limitations as well as the improvement of 
visualization techniques, were strongly advocated.  
This latter suggestion was eventually implemented 
by the PICES Technical Committee on Data 
Exchange (TCODE) through a Workshop on Data 
Visualization at PICES VIII in Vladivostok. 
 
Modeling of the North Pacific circulation has 
remained a central concern of POC over the years. 
PICES scientists were invited to present their 
results in scientific sessions on “Physical 
processes and modeling of the subarctic North 
Pacific and its marginal seas” at PICES III 
(Nemuro, 1994) and on “Modeling and prediction 
of physical processes in the subarctic North 
Pacific:  Progress since 1994” at PICES VIII 
(Vladivostok, 1999).  Members of POC interested 
in ocean modeling have also played an important 
role in the MODEL Task Team of the Climate 
Change and Carrying Capacity (CCCC) Program. 
Given the ever growing importance of numerical 
models in exploring and describing ocean 
circulation as well as their emerging operational 
role in marine forecasting, POC is likely to 
continue to be keenly interested in ocean 
modeling.  
 
Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio  
 
At PICES I, the Science Board gave its blessing to 
a POC Working Group (WG 1) on the Okhotsk 
Sea and the Oyashio, an area of great 
oceanographic importance which would also hold 
POC’s interest for a number years.  WG 1 was to 
review the present level of knowledge of the 
oceanic circulation and water mass modification in 
the area of interest, identify gaps, review studies 
relating chemical, biological and geological 
regimes, and encourage planning of observations 
and interdisciplinary experiments.  The group, 
under the chairmanship of Dr. Lynne D. Talley 
(U.S.A.), met in Nemuro, Japan, in September 
1993, and prepared an extensive review (published 
as PICES Scientific Report No. 2:  The Okhotsk 
Sea and Oyashio Region), identifying deficiencies 
in current understanding and recommending 
studies which would address these weaknesses.  
WG 1 also recommended that a follow-up meeting 
be held in Russia so as to fully engage Russian 
experts.  
 
At its following meeting (PICES II, Seattle, 1993) 
POC devoted half its session to reviewing and 
  
discussing WG 1’s report, which it enthusiastically 
endorsed.  POC supported the Working Group’s 
recommendation that a follow-up meeting be held 
in Vladivostok, so that more extensive Russian 
contributions could be incorporated in the review 
of the Sea of Okhotsk and Kuril region.  
 
Subsequently, an extensive workshop was held in 
Vladivostok (June 19-24, 1995), under the co-
chairmanship of Vyacheslav B. Lobanov (Russia), 
Yutaka Nagata and Lynne D.Talley;  97 papers 
were presented on all aspects of ocean sciences in 
the area of interest.  Workshop participants 
reviewed oceanographic and fisheries information 
and discussed data exchange (to be improved) and 
possible joint investigations (to be encouraged).  
Proceedings of the Vladivostok workshop on the 
Okhotsk Sea and adjacent areas were published as 
PICES Scientific Report No. 6.  POC agreed that 
PICES should maintain a continuing interest in the 
region and suggested that another workshop be 
held a few years hence to assess progress. 
 
A second Okhotsk Sea workshop was held in 
Nemuro, in the fall of 1998, under the direction of 
the same three convenors.  Participants focused on 
recent advances in the physical oceanography of 
the Sea of Okhotsk, discussed research activities 
of mutual interest, and recommended that PICES 
endorse and support international cooperative 
projects in the Sea of Okhotsk, the Kuril Islands 
region and the Western Pacific Gyre.  Proceedings 
of the Nemuro workshop are available as PICES 
Scientific Report No. 12. 
 
One of the recommendations of the first 
Vladivostok workshop was that PICES prepare a 
multilingual nomenclature of geographical and 
oceanographic features of the Sea of Okhotsk and 
its surroundings, so as to ensure clarity and 
eliminate ambiguity in reporting place names.  The 
nomenclature, establishing correspondences 
between names of land and marine features in 
Russian, Japanese and English, was completed in 
1998 and published jointly by PICES (PICES 
Scientific Report No. 8) and the Marine 
Information Research Center of Japan (MIRC).  
 
 
 
Japan/East Sea 
 
Another marginal sea of great interest, especially 
to western Pacific PICES members, is the Sea of 
Japan or East Sea (as it is called in Korea).  A 
Working Group on the Circulation and ventilation 
of the Japan/East Sea (WG 10) was created at 
PICES IV (Qingdao, 1995), with Co-Chairmen 
Drs. Sang-Kyung Byun (Korea) and Christopher 
N. K. Mooers (U.S.A.).  Terms of reference were 
very similar to those assigned to the Okhotsk Sea 
Working Group (WG 1), however with a different 
geographical focus and a stronger emphasis on 
physical oceanography.  Members of the Working 
Group met in Fukuoka, Japan, in February 1997, 
and again just before the PICES VI in Pusan 
(October 1997), where POC devoted a special 
scientific session to papers on the Japan/East Sea.  
 
Among its findings, WG 10 noted that the level of 
regional scientific communication and cooperation 
was excellent, but that scientific access by 
researchers to the EEZs of the surrounding 
countries remained “the greatest limitation to 
international cooperative studies”.  A strong 
recommendation to PICES was that it should 
foster and encourage international scientific 
programs in the area, helping smooth the path to 
data exchange and access to EEZs.  
 
WG 10 also provided a valuable forum for joint 
studies of the Japan/East Sea through support of, 
and collaboration with, the CREAMS program 
(Circulation Research of East Asian Marginal 
Seas).  A CREAMS workshop, held jointly with 
PICES at PICES VII (Fairbanks, 1998), extended 
the discussion beyond the traditional physical 
oceanography core of CREAMS to include 
ecosystem studies.  Follow-up workshops, in 
Seoul, in April 1998, and in Vladivostok, in May 
2000, have contributed to strenghtening the 
PICES-CREAMS collaboration.  In the wake of 
these discussions, the October-November 2000 
“PICES Cruise” of R/V Professor Gagarinskiy, so 
called because it took Russian scientists from 
Vladivostok to PICES IX in Hakodate, made 
multidisciplary observations towards a 
comprehensive study of the ecosystem structure of 
the northern Japan/East Sea. 
  
An extensive annotated bibliography of the 
oceanography of the Japan/East Sea prepared by 
Dr. Mikhail A. Danchenkov (Russia) was 
published as PICES Scientific Report No. 13.  
POC has continued to emphasize its support for 
the CREAMS and Japan/East Sea Office of Naval 
Research (U.S.A.) program as a working example 
of effective international collaboration. Additional 
workshops jointly sponsored by PICES are 
planned.  
 
The Bering Sea 
 
At PICES I, the Science Board created an 
interdisciplinary Working Group (WG 5) on the 
Bering Sea, with the mandate to review knowledge 
of the circulation, ocean properties and their 
variability, and the ecosystem and its response to 
environmental variability.  Although POC was not 
formally responsible for WG 5, it took a keen 
interest in its progress and supported its work.  
POC also supported the efforts of NOAA to bring 
together the Bering Sea Ecosystem Biophysical 
Metadatabase.  
 
CO
2
 in the North Pacific 
 
The North Pacific is recognized as an important 
sink for atmospheric CO
2
 in the ocean, and plays 
an important role in controlling long-term climate 
change.  POC turned in earnest to the “Climate” 
part of its mandate and, jointly with the Biological 
Oceanography Committee (BIO), recommended at 
PICES VI (Pusan, 1997) the creation of a Working 
Group on CO
2
 in the North Pacific.  This Working 
Group (WG 13), under co-chairmanship of Drs. 
Yukihiro Nojiri (Japan) and Richard A. Feely 
(U.S.A.), first met at a two-day workshop at 
PICES VII (Fairbanks, 1998), where members 
reviewed the state of knowledge of air-sea CO
2
 
exchange and the mechanisms controlling it, and 
planned their future work.  
 
Among the first priorities identified was the need 
to carry out comparisons of measurement 
techniques between various laboratories, in order 
to establish quantitative standards in estimating 
dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity and 
13
C/
12
C of inorganic carbon in sea water.  A first 
PICES-sponsored intercomparison (technical 
workshop) brought together participants in 
Tsukuba (April 1999);  a second exercise focused 
on improving the quality of alkalinity 
measurements and led to a second meeting, also in 
Tsukuba (October 2000).  A joint BIO/POC 
scientific session at PICES IX (Hakodate, 2000) 
gathered physicists, chemists and biologists, on the 
topic of “North Pacific carbon cycling and 
ecosystem dynamics”.  
 
Having addressed measurement standards, WG 13 
turned its attention to the task of data integration 
and synthesis, a topic first explored at a workshop 
held jointly with the PICES Technical Committee 
on Data Exchange (TCODE) in Sidney, B.C., 
Canada, in January 2001.  Workshop participants 
recommended (among other things) that PICES 
work together with international data centers to 
compile an International North Pacific Data 
Inventory for CO
2
 and CO
2
-related data (Dickson 
2001).  A follow-up workshop, again co-sponsored 
by WG 13 and TCODE, was held in Tokyo on 
July 31-August 2, 2001, to discuss the 
implementation of the data integration proposals 
made at the Sidney workshop.   
 
Oceanographic processes  
 
Most scientific sessions sponsored by POC, as 
well as those held under joint sponsorship with the 
Science Board and other scientific committees, 
focused on themes already selected for the 
attention of Working Groups.  For example, the 
“Ocean circulation and climate variability in the 
subarctic Pacific” theme of PICES II and the 
“Physical processes and modeling of the subarctic 
North Pacific and its marginal seas” theme of 
PICES III supported the activities of WG 6 and 
WG 7.  The theme of circulation and its variability 
was addressed again at the PICES IX session on 
“Large-scale circulation in the North Pacific”.  
The important modeling theme was also returned 
to at PICES VIII, where a session was devoted to 
“Modeling and prediction of physical processes in 
the subarctic North Pacific:  Progress since 1994”.  
 
Connections between ocean variability and climate 
change was the focus of PICES IV scientific 
presentations on “Circulation in the subarctic 
North Pacific and its marginal seas and its impact 
on climate” and PICES VII, with papers 
addressing “Decadal variability of the North 
  
Pacific climate”.  A joint session with BIO at 
PICES IX on “North Pacific carbon cycling and 
ecosystem dynamics” supported the work of  
WG 13.  Closer inter-disciplinary presentations 
were planned for PICES X with topic sessions on 
“Coastal ocean physical processes responsible for 
biological productivity and biological resource 
distribution” and on “The physics and biology of 
eddies, meanders and rings in the PICES region” 
(jointly with BIO and FIS).  
 
In some cases, scientific papers were solicited on 
more specific themes.  For example, presentations 
on “Exchanges between continental shelf waters 
and the nearby ocean” of PICES V addressed 
coastal processes which were further explored in 
PICES VI in a session devoted to the “Circulation 
and ventilation of North Pacific marginal and 
semi-enclosed seas”, which also supported the 
work of WG 10.  
 
Input to inter-disciplinary programs 
 
A number of Working Groups, special committees 
and Task Teams created by PICES have also 
attracted the interest and participation of the 
Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee. 
POC was a strong supporter of the creation of  
WG 9 on Monitoring of the Subarctic Pacific, and 
kept itself appraised of its progress.  POC has 
supported and encouraged the work of TCODE.  
POC members have also been influential 
participants in the development of the CCCC 
Program and especially of its MODEL and 
MONITOR Task Teams.  
 
Other concerns 
 
While the work of POC is most clearly manifested 
through the activities of its Working Groups and 
the selection of topics for scientific sessions at 
PICES Annual Meetings, a number of other issues 
have repeatedly been raised at POC meetings, 
some of them with specific impacts on PICES 
business. 
 
As in many inter-governmental organizations, 
there is a tendency for PICES meetings to be 
dominated by scientists working for government 
agencies.  Early on, POC advocated increased 
participation by non-government researchers, 
particularly from universities, who have much to 
offer in ocean sciences.  POC also strongly 
supported initiatives to increase participation by 
younger scientists in PICES meetings.  
 
Research funding is often preferentially directed 
towards new ideas, sometimes at the detriment of 
long-term monitoring programs.  POC emphasized 
the importance of maintaining a balance between 
routine monitoring and directed observational 
programs in support of specific scientific 
objectives.  
 
At one of its early meetings, POC advocated the 
idea of “State-of-the-Ocean” reports, describing 
conditions in various parts of the subarctic North 
Pacific.  Thanks to official encouragement and the 
enthusiasm of a few volunteers, the idea 
germinated into the regional overviews now 
regularly appearing in PICES Press.  
 
As a means of handling the many requests for 
special publications or translations put to them by 
scientists from member countries, POC and other 
committees suggested the creation of a 
Publications Committee, which has since 
developed procedures to consider such issues.  
 
Every year, POC has re-affirmed the need for 
international collaboration in ocean studies, and 
the role which PICES, as a treaty organization, can 
play in facilitating exchanges and access to 
national EEZs for scientific investigations.  The 
support of CREAMS, mentioned earlier, and 
recommendations for continuation of the La 
Perouse/Soya Project implemented by Russian and 
Japanese laboratories, are examples of the positive 
role which PICES can play.  
 
New technologies 
 
Technological improvements play an important 
role in ocean exploration.  From its very 
beginning, POC has recognized the importance of 
new technologies and observing strategies, as well 
as data collection and management, for the 
progress of oceanographic studies.  POC 
recommended to PICES a closer collaboration 
with CLIVAR and GOOS programs. 
 
  
At its meetings in 1998, 1999 and 2000, POC 
emphasized and endorsed a closer collaboration of 
PICES member countries to develop and 
implement the Argo program and co-sponsored an 
Argo meeting in Sidney, B.C., Canada, in March 
2001. 
 
POC also initiated contacts with NEAR-GOOS 
(the North East Asian Regional component of the 
Global Ocean Observing System) project, under 
development by the Intergovernmental 
Oceanographic Commission (IOC/WESTPAC) for 
the Japan, East China Sea and Yellow Sea area.  
As a result, a closer cooperation has developed 
between PICES and NEAR-GOOS in the form of 
an exchange of expertise in developing 
international observing systems and a 
multidisciplinary ecosystem approach to ocean 
studies.  PICES experts and representatives 
attended the NEAR-GOOS meetings in September 
1999 and August 2001.  Conversely, NEAR-
GOOS representatives attended the PICES Annual 
Meetings in Vladivostok (1999) and Hakodate 
(2000).  
 
A continuing role for POC 
 
In the formative decade of PICES, the Physical 
Oceanography and Climate Committee has acted 
as a focus for scientific discussions of the 
oceanography of the subarctic North Pacific and 
its marginal seas;  it has brought together in 
friendly and mutually beneficial collaboration 
scientists from member countries;  and it has 
actively enhanced participation of physical 
oceanographers and climatologists in 
interdisciplinary programs.  
 
As PICES refines its purpose of advancing 
“scientific knowledge about the ocean 
environment, global weather and climate change, 
living resources and their ecosystems, and the 
impact of human activities”, the Physical 
Oceanography and Climate Committee will 
continue to be a preferred forum for exchange of 
ideas and information on issues of common 
interest to signatories. 
 
Marine issues facing PICES members are both 
local and basin-scale.  Local issues, while affected 
by local circumstances, have a great degree of 
commonality:  coastal management, pollution, 
aquaculture, marine tourism, near-shore fisheries.  
Within the next decade, one should expect 
significant advances in operational modeling of 
the coastal environment.  Ocean scientists and 
engineers from PICES member countries will 
strongly benefit from the exchange of ideas and 
technology on this issue.  POC could play a useful 
role in creating a Working Group which would 
review the state of the art and the practical 
prospects of marine operational modeling.  
 
Basin-scale issues such as climate change and 
regime shifts affect all parties.  Characterization, 
recognition and eventually prediction of oceanic 
regime shifts is the central problem in 
understanding the long-term variability of the 
North Pacific.  POC can continue to provide 
leadership by focusing the efforts of PICES 
scientists on this issue. 
 
An understanding of the physics of the ocean and 
of its interaction with the atmosphere is an 
essential and basic component of all these issues.  
This is where POC comes in.  POC members will 
continue to explore and suggest means of 
collaboration to enhance and accelerate 
understanding of ocean circulation properties and 
interactions with the atmosphere.  Combining 
focused topic sessions, Working Groups with 
well-defined mandates, and interdisciplinary tasks 
(within the Climate Change and Carrying Capacity 
Program, for example) has provided an attractive 
and fruitful formula to engage physical 
oceanographers, modelers and climate scientists.

Toward a new era of oceanography 
 
The twentieth century was a remarkable period for 
oceanography.  We learned much about the 
fundamental distribution of properties of the seas 
and the balances that govern our ocean.  We now 
know, among other things, why the ocean surface 
currents do not follow the wind;  why the 
circulation in the Oceans is dominated by large 
basin-wide gyres;  why there are swift currents in 
the west; why the tropical circulation is different 
from that at high latitudes;  why coastal regimes 
differ from open ocean regimes;  why the water 
properties in the Southern Ocean are intimately 
connected to conditions in the North Atlantic;  
why the temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean 
matters to climates in the United States, South 
Africa and Australia;  and why human activities 
now may change sea level toward the end of this 
century.  The advances in knowledge have been 
great. 
 
If we were to characterize the last century, it might 
be in terms of science and discovery and the 
building of knowledge and understanding (Smith 
2001).  The advances have required innovation in 
observations, in theoretical research, and in the 
development and construction of numerical 
models.  Technological innovation has been 
critical, first to construct instruments that could 
measure, with accuracy and precision, in the harsh 
environment of the ocean, and more recently, to 
enable remote and autonomous measurements;  to 
paralle code, run and analyze ocean models;  and 
to provide rapid exchange and analysis of data via 
the Internet. 
 
Other speakers will have to summarize the many 
accomplishments from the many individual and 
collaborative scientific and technical endeavors of 
recent decades.  As we look forward to the next 
decade, we see opportunities to exploit our ocean  
knowledge and our growing technological 
capabilities for the betterment of humankind and 
the advance of our understanding of how the ocean 
affects the physical, chemical and biological state 
of our planet. 
 
In this paper we place particular focus on the 
possibilities of a global ocean observing system 
and the gradual move toward oceanography as a 
more operational activity.  In several ways 
oceanography is following the path developed by 
meteorology, implementing operational 
observation and forecast systems, yet in other 
ways there are significant differences.  For 
meteorology, forecast skill is the dominant 
paradigm, an exemplar that seems equally 
applicable to climate forecasting, particularly that 
associated with El Niño.  However, the rich living 
and non-living resources of the ocean, the critical 
importance attached to the coastal and marine 
environment, and the rich biodiversity of the 
oceans, among other things, make quantitative 
knowledge of the ocean state important in its own 
right.  The market for ocean state estimates and 
forecasts (“marine services”) exists now and we 
will attempt to show that we have the knowledge, 
technology and community “spirit” to develop a 
robust, sustained system of ocean observations, 
products and services that will serve us for this 
decade and beyond. 
 
For the most part we focus on physical 
oceanography, and systems that have been 
developed with a view toward operational 
oceanography.  There are of course many aspects 
that we ignore within this discipline, and even 
more from related disciplines. 
 
The global ocean observing system 
 
The history of widespread ocean observation 
began in the middle of the nineteenth century, 
  
when merchant sailing vessels started a systematic 
effort to collect and exchange information on 
weather and the state of the seas on their trade 
routes.  Well over a century passed before any 
attempt was made to build on these pioneering 
efforts a systematic system for ocean observation.  
A major step forward in basin-scale observing 
efforts was implemented during Tropical Ocean 
Global Atmosphere (TOGA), for which a tropical 
Pacific-wide research observing system was 
designed, deployed and operated.  In the last 
decade of the twentieth century, it became clear 
that a permanent observing system for the ocean 
was viable and sustainable.  It took many years of 
planning and discussion before the ocean 
community started to widely endorse such an 
effort.  The Ocean Observing System 
Development Panel (OOSDP 1995) provided a 
template for the global ocean observing system for 
climate, and this template has been adapted and 
modified by many as we move toward a sustained 
observing system (Nowlin 1999;  Nowlin et al. 
2000). 
 
At the First International Conference for Ocean 
Observing Systems for Climate, agreement was 
reached on the essential elements of the observing 
system for the next decade and beyond (Smith and 
Koblinsky 2001).  The system would include: 
 
• Sea surface temperature measurements from 
satellites (visible, infrared, microwave) and in 
situ platforms (surface drifters, moorings, 
volunteer observing vessels); 
• Surface vector winds from satellites and in situ 
instruments;  
• Sea surface height variability from satellite 
altimeters and in situ measurements from tide 
gauges for the long-term climate record and 
validation (also needs good sea surface level 
pressure measurements); 
• Upper ocean temperature and, where practical, 
salinity measurements from a variety of 
networks including the tropical moored buoys, 
Argo, the ship of opportunity XBT network 
(now principally in high-density and 
frequently repeated modes), other moorings 
and hydrography; 
• Surface and upper ocean current 
measurements; 
• Tracers and carbon measurements from 
hydrography for transport and inventory 
calculations; and 
• Air-sea fluxes from ocean reference sites and 
lines, and from operational met models. 
 
Smith and Koblinsky (2001) and the other papers 
in that volume provide a more comprehensive 
account of the many different contributions of 
which the above form just a part.  The most 
important message is that the technology for a 
truly global ocean observing system exists now, 
based on both satellite and in situ technologies.  
There is also ample evidence that there is the 
collective will to realize such a system.  Indeed, 
many nations have already made significant 
commitments. 
 
Ocean state estimation 
 
An important complement to the ability to observe 
the oceans is the ability to routinely assimilate this 
information, and to provide methods for exploiting 
this information for broader scientific and socio-
economic benefit.  In many instances it is not 
knowledge of the current state of the ocean at 
some location and depth that matters, but rather 
the inferences that can be drawn from this 
information and that at many other locations.  
These inferences are often applicable at locations 
far removed from the source information and, in 
many cases, involve fields and parameters not 
connected with oceanography (for example, 
rainfall estimates in North America or Indonesia).  
It is not the intent here to discuss these many 
applications in detail, but rather to provide a 
description of the systems that are being built to 
underpin synthesis and interpretation, and, in 
particular, the process of using ocean models to 
assimilate data, a procedure we refer to here as 
ocean state estimation. 
 
Ocean state estimation, or ocean data assimilation 
is an optimization problem.  Given a set of 
dynamical equations with associated estimates of 
model errors, and a set of ocean data with 
associated estimates of observational errors, and  
 
  
an error functional (“cost function”) that is to be 
minimized, a variety of data assimilation 
techniques exist for approximating the ocean state 
that best satisfies the various constraints.  Viewed 
as a four-dimensional space-time problem, the 
challenge is to blend measurements of the ocean 
state distributed irregularly in both space and time 
to produce regular (gridded) estimates of the ocean 
state for the present and past, and as appropriate 
for the future (forecasts).  
 
These procedures are commonplace in 
meteorology and weather forecasting, and are 
becoming more common in climate and ocean 
applications.  At present, ocean state estimation is 
performed operationally by some government 
efforts, and in research mode by an increasing 
number of research efforts.  Each of these is 
limited to some extent by the available data, both 
for making and evaluating the skill of the 
operational estimates. 
 
Many nations have agreed that a new push to 
expand our ocean data asssimilation efforts is 
needed and have begun to participate in the Global 
Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE; 
Le Traon et al. 2001;  IGST 2000), which is to 
have its intensive work period between 2003 and 
2005. 
 
The operational meteorology community has been 
making products with data assimilation for almost 
half a century, and offers valuable experience for 
the ocean community to draw upon.  GODAE 
sponsors workshops to ensure that the ocean 
community benefits from the experiences of the 
meteorology community. 
 
Issues for ocean state estimation 
 
In comparison with meteorology, operational 
oceanography is immature.  The observing 
systems are not complete and those networks that 
are established mostly have short records. The 
models and data assimilation methods are also 
immature.  The models often display significant 
biases relative to observations.  The data 
assimilation systems are limited by our ability to 
measure and model skillfully the many of the 
energetic scales of the ocean, including strong  
 
currents and mesoscale eddies.  Nevertheless, 
considerable progress has been made in 
operational ocean forecasting and in climate 
forecasting, using a variety of methods. 
 
The simplest form of data assimilation is objective 
interpolation, which requires the specification of 
the data errors and the covariance functions 
between the variables.  Optimal interpolation (OI) 
has been widely used in oceanography since the 
mid-1970s, and variants are still used in several 
operational analysis and climate prediction 
systems.  The method offers valuable perspective, 
because the utility of OI products is easily seen to 
depend critically on the specified statements of 
uncertainty.  The OI product is only as good as the 
data distribution and covariance and error 
estimates. 
 
Operational meteorology teaches us that we must 
work hard to learn how best to specify the full 
range of data and model errors, covariances and 
cost functions, if we seek useful ocean products.  
In many parts of the world ocean we do not have 
enough data to make dependable estimates of 
these quantities.  Indeed, it is probably in the area 
of knowledge of (parameterized) processes and 
subgrid scale motions that we suffer most severely 
from a data shortage.  Is the community prepared 
to invest in “local dynamics” experiments in these 
regions?  In their absence we must go forward 
with assumptions of unclear utility, having unclear 
impact on our product skill. 
 
Research based on operational meteorology 
products also teaches us that it can take some 
years before such products have sufficient skill to 
yield the desired insights into the kinematics and 
dynamics of the atmosphere.  Atmospheric science 
research now depends heavily on operational 
products and periodic “re-analyses” of the 
historical atmospheric data set. 
 
We must expect a learning period of increasing 
skill with our operational ocean products, and not 
be discouraged by early efforts.  Having wide 
community access to the ocean products and wide 
community examination and feedback concerning 
their utility, will be essential for rapid progress in 
their skill and usefulness. 
  
Data transmission, quality control (QC) and 
dissemination issues 
 
Getting ocean data back from the marine 
environment promptly, effectively and cost-
efficiently is key for many marine services.  There 
appears to be a need in excess of what Service 
ARGOS can provide.  Access to these data and to 
the products made from them is also necessary if 
the ocean community is to benefit. 
 
The meteorology community has considerable 
infrasture dedicated to these tasks, e.g., the World 
Weather Watch’s Global Telecommunications 
System and the various national meteorological 
service product distribution pipelines.  The ocean 
community needs capable Information Technology 
infrastructure to meet its needs. 
 
As “research quality” QC is done on the historical 
data sets, there is also a need to be able to keep 
track of what has been done, and make it possible 
for researcher, policy-makers and re-analysis 
efforts to find the version(s) of the data sets most 
likely to be useful to them. 
 
Based on our history, it is unlikely that there will 
be a “definitive” QC data set for the ocean in the 
foreseeable future;  one group’s noise is another 
group’s signal.  Various national efforts are in 
place and under development to address these 
issues. 
 
GODAE is taking the lead to provide interfaces to 
the variety of different efforts that are in place and 
under development.  The United States is 
supporting development and operation of a 
GODAE real time data and ocean product server 
sited at Fleet Numerical Meteorology 
Oceanographic Centre (FNMOC) in Monterey, 
CA, U.S.A. 
 
The WMO’s Joint Commission on Oceanography 
and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) is also 
devoting effort to a range of data set issues.  
Technology for low power, low cost data 
transmission and data sharing also exist. 
 
Ocean forecasts 
As noted earlier, it is the ability to draw inferences 
from ocean measurements in regions and fields 
remote from the data site, that is perhaps the most 
valuable aspect of the global observing system 
infrastructure.  However, the methodology of 
ocean state estimation only takes us part of the 
way.  The most immediate way we can use such a 
data set is as a basis for producing an ocean or 
climate forecast, the so-called initial-value 
problem.  Given a faithful estimate of the state of 
the ocean today, we can forecast the ocean state.  
For some variables we can hope to have forecast 
skill for several weeks, perhaps even months.  
Our ability to do this is limited by several factors.  
Firstly, we are limited in our ability to observe the 
current state of the ocean and, secondly, the 
methods and models we use to produce the 
estimate have limitations, in many cases quite 
severe.  As the previous sections have indicated, 
we have made considerable progress in addressing 
both these issues but most accept that there is still 
a long way to go (the challenge lies with GODAE 
and the several operational oceanography centers 
at the moment). 
But more fundamentally the ocean is a chaotic 
medium, with small perturbations growing over 
time through non-linear interactions and 
feedbacks.  The growth of such errors places 
natural limits on predictability, the degree to 
which one can determine a future state of the 
system.  At present, our knowledge of ocean 
predictability is scant, principally because there 
has not been the need to determine predictability 
limits up till this point.  The other issue is that the 
ocean is being continually forced by the 
atmosphere, which itself is unpredictable over 
certain time and space scales.  So, while we 
anticipate internal ocean circulation errors may 
grow relatively slowly (perhaps 3-4 weeks at mid-
latitudes), we must also take account of far more 
rapid error growth in surface forcing fields. 
 
These issues notwithstanding, considerable 
progress has been made in ocean and climate 
forecasting with several centers routinely 
producing forecasts of the ocean state.  
  
In some cases, such as El Niño, the oceans and 
atmosphere interact in such a way as to introduce 
modes of variability that seemingly have much 
longer time scales of predictability.  This is the 
basis for several experimental and operational 
climate forecast systems.  The extent to which 
other climate phenomena are predictable is 
receiving intensive study now, through CLIVAR 
and other programs. 
 
As noted in the opening section, one of the 
distinguishing aspects of oceanography is the fact 
that many applications involve knowledge of the 
ocean and marine environment, in some cases in 
the past.  We are not only interested in forecasts of 
the future but also in “forecasts” of the ocean state 
for locations and variables separated from the 
measurements.  For the oil and gas industry, this 
might take the form of statistics for extreme 
currents near the bottom at a specific location.  For 
the fishing industry it might be forecasts of 
advection and vertical circulation for ocean 
dispersal of larvae.  For coastal management, it 
might be boundary conditions for local coastal 
management models.  In all cases the challenge is 
to extrapolate and infer fields that are not directly 
measurable and, like forecasts in time, errors arise 
from both the limitations of the methods and from 
natural error growth (unpredictability). 
 
GODAE is making considerable progress in 
developing links to value-adding communities 
where such activities take place.  PICES may well 
be one of those communities though we recognize 
the immaturity of the endeavor at present.  Such 
connections will require experimentation and 
much dialogue. 
 
The coming decade 
 
It does seem the ocean communities of the world 
are willing to embrace the concept of: 
• a sustained ocean observing system (satellite 
and in situ); 
• modern data transmission and data serving 
infrastructure; 
• dedicated ocean product development and 
production efforts; 
• wide community access and examination of 
the ocean products; 
• community feedback so that the OS and the 
products will improve. 
 
Given this acceptance, the coming decade will 
provide many opportunities for innovative 
applications and science.

As one of the four core Scientific Committees of 
PICES, the unique mission of the Biological 
Oceanography Committee (BIO) is to promote and 
coordinate biological oceanography and 
interdisciplinary research in the northern North 
Pacific Ocean.  BIO plays a key intermediary role 
with respect to the other PICES Standing 
Committees.  For example, lower trophic levels 
may be the most directly affected by processes 
considered by the Physical Oceanography and 
Climate Committee (POC).  These lower trophic 
levels then, affect and are affected by the upper 
trophic levels.  BIO interacts with the Fisheries 
Science Committee (FIS) to provide scientific 
advice on ecological roles of lower and higher 
trophic level organisms on fisheries.  BIO also 
plays a central role in defining “normal” 
conditions against which changes of interest to 
Marine Environmental Quality Committee (MEQ) 
can be measured.  At the same time, BIO is 
responsible for developing scientific programs for 
annual and inter-session meetings, for formation 
of Working Groups on key areas of interest, for 
participation in the CCCC Implementation Panel 
and Task Teams, and for coordinating activities 
with other international and national programs.  
Here we summarize the 10-year record of the 
progress of BIO toward these goals.  
 
Members and phases of development 
  
The past and current BIO members are shown in 
Table 1.  During the initial phase (1992-1995), 
BIO generated its own scientific programs for 
Annual Meetings (Table 2).  In the intermediate 
phase (1996-1998), BIO organized joint sessions 
with other Scientific Committees (Table 2) and 
sponsored the formation of two Working Groups 
(Table 3).  In the third phase of development 
(1999-2001), BIO further expanded efforts for 
jointly sponsored sessions with other Scientific 
Committees and the CCCC Program  
(Table 2), and developed interactions with other 
relevant international organizations (Table 3).  
 
Activities of Working Groups  
 
Working Group 11:  Consumption of marine 
resources by marine birds and mammals in the 
PICES region (Co-Chairmen:  Hidehiro Kato of 
Japan and George L. Hunt of U.S.A.).  The 
Working Group was formed to tabulate available 
data on population sizes and diet composition of 
marine birds and mammals, and to calculate their 
seasonal and annual prey consumption to evaluate 
their predation effects on intermediate and lower 
trophic levels within the PICES region.  To 
facilitate comparison and summarization, the 
PICES region (30ºN to the Bering Strait) was 
divided into 14 sub-regions (Introduction to this 
volume, Fig. 2) based on oceanographic features.  
While the quality and quantity of information was 
not uniform across the sub-regions, the Working 
Group revealed that at least 47 marine mammal 
species and 135 seabird species inhabit the PICES 
region.  Estimates of abundance exceed 
10,000,000 marine mammals and 200,000,000 
seabirds.  Seabirds and marine mammals are 
widely distributed throughout the PICES region.  
The mean size of individuals ranges from 28 kg to 
over 10,000 kg for marine mammals and from  
20 g to 8,000 g for marine birds.  Pooling available 
estimates of the western PICES sub-regions 
(approximately 49% of the total PICES region), 
total prey consumption by marine mammals is 
estimated to be 13 million tons during summer 
(June-September, 122 days) per year.  Estimates 
for predation by seabirds are 1 million tons in sub-
region BSC, 0.5 million tons in sub-region ASK, 
and 50 thousand tons in sub-region CAS.  For the 
estimates covering the entire PICES region, there 
are still gaps of information to be filled (for details

marine mammals and birds is important for the 
research on ecosystem dynamics in the PICES 
region, Working Group 11 was restructured and 
reformed as Marine Birds and Mammals  (MBM) 
Advisory Panel since 1999 to fulfill its research 
objective.  
 
Working Group 14:  Effective sampling of 
micronekton to estimate ecosystem carrying 
capacity (Co-Chairmen:  Richard D. Brodeur of 
U.S.A. and Orio Yamamura of Japan).  The major 
objective of the Working Group is to obtain and 
tabulate data on consumption and biomass of 
micronekton in the PICES region, together with 
improvement of its sampling gears.  
“Micronekton” comprises adult euphausiids, 
mesopelagic fish, mysids, pelagic shrimps and 
cephalopods.   
 
In addition to creating data inventories of 
micronekton in the North Pacific, topics under 
discussion are geographic zonation design (by 
adapting the sub-region system used by Working 
Group 11 mentioned above), reproduction, early 
life history and demographic rates;  prey-predator 
relationships and rates (diet composition, food 
consumption rates, predators and predation rates, 
parasites and diseases);  and sampling 
considerations (net towing, acoustics, visual 
design). 
 
Review of BIO strategic plan  
 
During its development, BIO set six goals for 
coordinating biological oceanography within 
PICES (Table 4).  Here we state each goal and 
progress towards its implementation.  Overall, 
BIO had great success in stimulating and 
coordinating research in biological oceanography 
within the PICES framework.  Over the last 
decade, the extent of this success is highlighted by 
the international and interdisciplinary work 
summarized above, that covers physical 
oceanography and climate, upper and lower 
trophic levels of the marine ecosystem, stimulation 
of the long-term observational studies and 
modeling efforts of the PICES-GLOBEC CCCC 
Program, and expansion of coordinated 
interdisciplinary harmful algal bloom studies into 
the PICES region.  Our recent efforts with the 
marine mammals and birds, and micronekton, will 
continue the facilitation of studies of ocean 
impacts from the bottom of the food web to the top 
in the North Pacific Ocean.

Goal Progress 
Improve cooperation with other PICES 
components 
Accomplished by sponsoring many joint topic sessions with CCCC, POC, 
MBM Advisory Panel at PICES IX, and with POC, FIS, and MEQ at 
PICES X 
Enhance interaction with relevant international 
organizations 
BIO proposed a joint ICES/PICES/GLOBEC Symposium on 
Comparative zooplankton ecology to be held in May 2003 
Increase involvement in specific recognized 
scientific issues 
BIO participated in a workshop on "Designing the iron fertilization 
experiment in the subarctic Pacific" in Tsukuba, Japan, 2000, and plans 
participation in field experiments in 2001 and beyond 
Improve community attendance and 
participation in Committees, Task Teams and 
Working Groups 
This remains a problem area 
 
 
Improve inter-sessional work via e-mail leading 
to shorter and more efficient Annual Meetings 
This has only been partly successful.  More e-mails do not necessarily 
lead to shorter meetings 
Increase travel support for student participation 
at Annual Meetings 
PICES is providing partial support for some students and young 
scientists, but BIO does not have data available to document extent or 
details 
Scientific themes and future prospects 
 
A distillation of BIO activities over the last decade 
generates three primary themes:  (1) regional and 
basin-wide comparisons of lower and upper 
trophic levels,  (2) importance of life histories, 
alternate food webs, and understudied groups of 
organisms for ecosystem analysis,  and (3) role of 
trace metals and biogeochemical cycling in 
controlling biological production and the carbon 
cycle.  We will not attempt to give a 
comprehensive overview of these themes, but 
provide some illustrative examples of leaps 
forward and remaining gaps in our understanding.  
  
 
 
 
 
A major early success of PICES interest in basin 
scale comparisons is presented in the special issue 
of Progress in Oceanography on “Ecosystem 
dynamics in the eastern and western Gyres of the 
Subarctic Pacific” (Beamish et al. [Eds.] 1999).  
Harrison et al. (1999) noted higher nutrients and 
chlorophyll in the west compared to the east but 
similar levels of primary production (Table 5).  
Mackas and Tsuda (1999) concluded that there is 
some evidence that the western Gyre is more 
productive than the Alaska Gyre (Fig. 1), but 
noted that more research is needed to determine if 
there is a permanent east-west gradient.  More 
important for ecosystem analysis is the recognition 
of interannual and interdecadal changes and links 
to climate variability.  Mackas and Tsuda (1999) 
described evidence of long-term shifts in 
biological characteristics such as size structure and 
life history timing for subarctic zooplankton, and 
concluded that “Comparisons of both present 
ecosystem state and historical precursors among 
different parts of the North Pacific are likely to be 
essential for development of this understanding” 
(of changes in the pelagic ecosystem that are large 
in amplitude, but are widely and unevenly spaced 
across decades).  A significant expansion of this 
work on the importance of nutrients in controlling 
the levels of primary production in the eastern and 
western gyres, is the application of satellite data 
on the distributions of nitrate (inferred from 
temperature) and phytoplankton (inferred from 
ocean color as a measure of chlorophyll).  Using 
such data, Goes et al. (2001) showed how the 
onset of El Niño resulted in depressed 
phytoplankton production in the Gulf of Alaska, 
but increased phytoplankton production in the 
following spring and summer in the western North 
Pacific (Fig. 2).   
 
A second theme emerging in the progress of 
biological oceanography of the North Pacific 
Ocean is variation or deviation from traditional 
food webs along with recognition of woefully 
understudied groups of organisms.  A striking 
example of a change in food web structure is the 
unusual appearance of coccolithophore blooms in 
the Bering Sea (Fig. 3), concurrent changes in 
relative abundances of copepods and euphausids 
(Napp and Hunt 2001, Stockwell et al. 2001), and 
massive die-off of short-tailed shearwaters 
(Puffinus tenuirostris), an apex predator in the 
south-eastern Bering Sea (Baduini et al. 2001).  
Another example of a major change in foob web 
structure is the seven-fold increase in gelatinous 
zooplankton in the Bering Sea (Fig. 4) that may 
result from a competitive interaction between 
jellyfish and walleye pollock (Brodeur et al. 1999, 
2002).  Both of these changes in the Bering Sea 
appear to be related to climate changes, but the 
underlying causes and interactive effects remain to 
be determined.  A special issue of Progress in 
Oceanography will cover “Variability in the 
Bering Sea Ecosystem” (Macklin et al. [Eds.] 
2002).

The understudied groups of organisms in the 
North Pacific Ocean include micronekton and 
marine birds and mammals.  Micronekton include 
small squid, migratory midwater fish and shrimps, 
that are difficult to sample quantitatively.  Mackas 
and Tsuda (1999) demonstrate the importance of 
micronekton by partitioning the consumption of 
copepod production (Neocalanus) in the subarctic 
Pacific (Fig. 5).  Their analysis suggests that 
approximately one-third of the total predation of 
Neocalanus is likely to be due to squids, 
myctophids, shrimp and deep-living chaetognaths.  
Work is underway by WG 14 to develop and 
improve methods for sampling and assessing the 
role of microzooplankton in the North Pacific. 
 
Marine birds and mammals comprise another 
major understudied group in the North Pacific 
ecosystem.  As part of the east-west gyre 
comparison, Springer et al. (1999) reviewed the 
gross distribution of seabirds and certain marine 
mammals in the North Pacific gyres to compare 
their east-west distributions.  The available 
information indicates that seabird biomass in the 
western gyre is three-fold greater than that in the 
eastern gyre.  Cetaceans (prior to overharvesting) 
were also more abundant in the western gyre.  
Both of these observations suggest higher 
productivity in the western gyre as was also 
suggested by Mackas and Tsuda (1999) and by 
Goes et al. (2001).  Hunt et al. (2000) compiled 
more extensive data on biomass distribution and 
prey consumption and identified major gaps in the 
survey of marine birds and mammals in the 
regional areas depicted in Figure 2 (Introduction to 
this volume).  As better observational data become 
available it is clear that populations of marine 
birds and mammals fluctuate with changing 
climate conditions.   
 
Current work in the southeast Bering Sea  
demonstrates major changes in the importance of 
large whales in the 1990s in terms of predation 
and carbon cycling (Tynan 2001).  Combinations 
of long-term observations of abundances and 
migrations with measures of consumption 
demonstrate dramatic changes in the roles of large 
whales as top predators in the southeast Bering 
Sea (Tynan 2001).  It is only by increasing our 
knowledge of the abundance and activity of these 
important groups, that we will have sufficient 
information to understand and predict possible 
changes in the ecosystem resulting from climatic 
or anthropogenic changes. 
 
Finally, the role of trace metals and 
biogeochemical cycling in controlling biological 
production and the carbon cycle has, and will, 
continue to receive attention in studies of the 
North Pacific.  The role of iron as an important 
trace metal limiting phytoplankton production was 
first recognized in the subarctic Pacific by the late 
John Martin.  Investigations in the Gulf of Alaska 
demonstrate an important role of iron and light in 
regulating diatom growth (Fig. 6, Harrison et al. 
1999).  Their results support the conclusion that 
iron limits the primary productivity of the large 
cells (especially diatoms) except in the winter 
when iron and light become co-limiting.  The 
small phytoplankton do not appear to be iron 
limited, but are mainly controlled by 
microzooplankton grazers.   The potential effect of 
iron on the subarctic ecosystem continues to be an 
important area of investigation with a PICES 
supported field program planned for 2002-2003.   
 
Studies of carbon cycling have been jointly 
sponsored by BIO and POC through workshops 
and topic sessions, and the most recent results will 
be presented in a special issue of Deep-Sea 
Research II in 2002.  Other examples of important 
aspects of biogeochemistry in the North Pacific 
include re-evaluation of estimates of nitrogen 
fixation in the Pacific Ocean and globally (Karl et 
al. 2001), and the impact of microbial food webs 
in both the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans.  These 
issues will be covered in a special issue of 
Progress in Oceanography on “Plankton size 
classes, functional groups, and ecosystem 
dynamics: Causes and consequences” (Bychkov 
and Pena [Eds.] 2003).   We anticipate that such 
studies will continue to be an important part of 
PICES activities through the next decade. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 5 Fate of Neocalanus plumchrus production, as estimated from a life-stage partitioning of mortality 
weighted by individual body size.  Shading indicates degree of availability to different sets of predators.  
About one-third (unshaded) is in the upper layer on small nauplii and early copepodites, and is probably 
available mostly to invertebrate predators.  Slightly over one third  (sloped lines) is on larger C3-C5 
copepodites during the brief time window before they leave the surface layer.  This fraction is the only 
one likely to be directly available to the larger planktivorous pelagic fish, sea birds and marine mammals.  
It is also available to invertebrates and migratory micronecton.  The remainder occurs below the upper 
150 m, mostly on diapausing C5 and adults (stippled);  this fraction is likely to be available primarily to 
midwater micronekton.  Figure 5 from Mackas and Tsuda (1999).

A personal introduction 
 
My academic career started in agriculture, then I 
obtained my doctorate in the faculty of medicine, 
and only after this did I become aware of ecology 
as a science applied to fisheries.  I had learned to 
gather data on complex problems in agriculture 
and medicine, analyse the data and form 
conclusions.  When I started to study the biology 
of the sea in the late 1950s, it was apparent that 
biological studies were dominated by fisheries 
science.  This science had a different approach to 
those that I had learned earlier – fisheries science 
was dominated by a theory on population 
dynamics in which there was little agreement 
between the data and the theory.  The literature 
was full of stock/recruitment curves in which the 
data points seldom, if ever, fell on a line 
supporting the theoretically assumed relationship. 
Fisheries scientists were not responsible for 
collecting these data;  they came largely from fish 
catch and the scatter of points was assumed to 
reflect inaccuracies in catch data rather than any 
fault in the ecological theory.  At the same time, 
other branches of ecology had evolved in a largely 
conceptual sense characterised by a language of 
terms which were difficult to define precisely, 
such as biocoenosis, niche and neutralism – some 
of which also required further definition such as 
hypervolume niche, realised niche, etc.  There was 
also a heavy use of probability statistics, 
particularly in fisheries science, which substituted 
for a lack of real understanding of processes.  The 
whole science seemed to be more an expression of 
mystical faith than an understanding of Nature.  
 
At that time, biological oceanography was in its 
infancy and had been largely concerned with 
measuring plankton abundance and nutrients, with 
little attempt to couple life in the sea with the 
ocean environment.  It was not until the late 1940s 
(e.g., Riley 1946) that some dynamic processes 
were described.  These efforts remained largely 
unnoticed until the early 1970s when some  
awkward questions were asked by society 
regarding such practical problems as ocean 
pollution and declining fish stocks.  These 
questions required a more pragmatic approach to 
the science of the sea and, in the case of fisheries, 
a more scientific approach was called for in order 
to provide some realistic answers (“The Marine 
Revolution”, Ray 1970).  I believe that this 
revolution is still underway and that the key to our 
understanding of life in the sea lies in the 
accumulation of extensive new data, such as has 
already changed the course of other biological 
sciences (e.g., agriculture and medicine).  We 
should also avoid the promulgation of any 
ecological theories or models (such as the 
historical dominance of Population Dynamics in 
fisheries science), if they are not based on factual 
relationships, which can be further tested from 
subsequently collected data.  
 
In summary to my introduction, I believe that 
studies on the biological dynamics of marine life 
have fallen far behind other branches of applied 
biology, such as agriculture and medicine.  I do 
not believe that this is due entirely to a lack of 
financial support, but that we have in the past been 
heading in a wrong scientific direction.  We have a 
lot of catching up to do.  
 
The holistic approach to ecosystem 
understanding 
 
The basic model 
 
The need to include environmental or climatic 
changes in models aimed at ecosystem 
understanding can be given as shown in Figure 1.  
In this model we include the forcing functions of 
climate on the ecosystem and predator control 
through fish abundance, which is itself controlled 
by the extent of fisheries at the other end.  There 
are two potential short cuts, which I believe are to 
be avoided at all cost.  The first is to assume that 
fish abundance can be determined from some 
 
  
probability relationship directly with climate. 
There are numerous examples in the literature in 
which strong correlations have been shown to 
occur between a physical parameter, such as wind, 
and a fish population, only to see the correlation 
collapse after a few years.  For example, 
Drinkwater et al. (1996) reviewed a number of 
papers that related temperature to lobster 
abundance.  They concluded that increased lobster 
catches could not be related to temperature, in 
spite of several earlier findings to the contrary.  In 
fact, it seems intuitively correct that no species 
could have evolved with a heavy dependence on a 
single environmental factor that is highly variable.  
 
 
 
Fig. 1 A general relationship between climate, 
the ecosystem and fisheries indicating two 
alternate pathways for study which have been 
proved largely unacceptable in the past. 
 
The second tempting short cut in the model above, 
is to consider only how the ecosystem affects fish 
abundance and to leave out the climate as a more 
or less random function.  An example of how this 
too does not work is given by Trites et al. (1999) 
who used Ecopath and Ecosim models to account 
for an almost four-fold increase in pollock 
biomass and other changes that occurred over two 
time periods following changes in whaling and 
fishing in the Bering Sea.  The mass-balance 
models per se failed to account for the observed 
changes, but there was a strong indication that 
environmental factors affecting primary 
production and recruitment were more important 
than predator/prey interactions alone.  Thus mass 
balance ecosystem models that do not include 
climate variability cannot provide reliable 
information on trends in marine fish production. 
‘Quick fix’ models that are not based on this 
fundamental understanding of ocean ecosystems 
should be avoided. 
The problem of scaling results 
 
Biological oceanographers have been studying the 
oceans on two different scales.  One involves very 
large-scale events over long time periods, such as 
the identification of regime shifts in fisheries data 
(e.g., Beamish et al. 2000;  Klyashtorin 1997). The 
other involves much more detailed studies of 
ecosystem relationships which are carried out over 
relatively small areas (e.g., Robinson and Ware 
1994) and, in some cases, inside mesocosms (e.g., 
Andersen et al. 1987).  Because of the amount of 
data on different parameters that are required by 
the latter studies, they cannot be performed over 
vast areas.  The problem is how to project the 
small-scale studies into the large scale studies to 
give us some understanding of how whole ocean 
systems can change. 
 
This problem can be partly resolved if ecosystem 
understanding can be focused on a critical period 
in the life cycle of a fish.  For example, Beamish 
and Mahnken (1999) have described critical 
size/critical period events in the life of coho 
salmon.  The first event is density-dependent 
predation when the salmon enter the sea, and the 
second event is density independent and related to 
mortality of the young smolts in the fall and winter 
months depending on how well they fed during the 
summer.  Thus the need to study the whole of the 
coho salmon ecosystem is narrowed to two critical 
periods.  Another example is found in Kruse and 
Tyler (1989) who describe several critical periods 
related to climate in the reproduction of the 
English sole. 
 
A more general presentation of this idea is given 
by Bax et al. (1999) who describe “leverage 
points” as points in time and space within an 
ecosystem where particular components are most 
vulnerable to change.  This is illustrated in Figure 
2 where various critical points are identified in an 
ecosystem model.  These are identified in order to 
suggest to managers of fisheries resources where 
the ecosystem becomes highly dependent on a 
particular process.  For example, the quantity of 
phytoplankton sinking out of the water column 
versus that which remains suspended, is a point 
that divides the primary production between the 
pelagic and benthic ecosystems.  Or in another 
example, both the precautionary approach to

management (adapted from Bax et al. 1999). 
catching fish and the occurrence of regime shifts 
are critical points in predator control of the 
ecosystem.  The role of bycatch in the ecosystem 
is generally ignored and should be included along 
with plans to utilize this high quality protein, such 
as in aquaculture.  Pollution is another “leverage 
point”, especially the eutrophication of coastal 
waters, which now appears to be widespread.  By 
identifying these points, the problem of applying 
detailed small-scale data to large ecosystems may 
become more tractable. 
 
Gathering new kinds of data over large areas 
and long time scales 
 
Recently, the idea of “operational oceanography” 
has been defined as the application of science to 
provide timely, accurate, value-added 
oceanographic products and services that affect 
decisions of clients.  This is a very broad 
definition and it is made in order to include a wide 
range of user agencies.  However, among these, 
operational oceanography is mandated to include 
real-time information on changes in ocean 
environments and primary productivity, with 
forecasts of their impact on ocean ecosystems.  
The purpose of this desideratum is to better 
manage and protect the fisheries resources of the 
ocean (Bancroft, personal communication).  Thus 
gathering of biological data needs to be part of 
operational oceanography if we are to supply data 
for forecasting ecosystem change.  This will 
require new methods and new programs. 
 
 
  
Although methodology seems a mundane part of 
science, in fact about half of the Nobel prizes 
awarded annually have been essentially for 
gaining scientific insight using a new method. 
Methods form the basis of data collection, and 
accumulated data are our only source of 
understanding ecosystems.  I do not want to dwell 
on the past, but I want to look at some of the 
newer techniques that are becoming available to 
study the vast expanse of the oceans.  We need 
new and original ways of gathering data at 
minimum expense.  While I cannot review 
techniques, which are yet to be invented, it serves 
my purpose in drawing attention to the value of 
methodology, to briefly review some of the new 
techniques that have recently impacted biological 
oceanography.  For example: 
• New ways of taking multiple samples of 
plankton, nutrients and the physical 
characteristics of water masses are essential.  
Such equipment replaces the traditional 
plankton net and bottle casts, and can be 
towed off commercial vessels; programs have 
to be developed for the North Pacific (e.g., 
using Batfish and BIONESS samplers). 
• New and better ways of counting and sizing 
plankton are also needed using more 
sophisticated instruments, which may 
sometimes be borrowed from medical science 
(e.g., the flow cytometer). 
• Satellite sensing is a wonderful way of 
covering vast areas of ocean, and the 
chlorophyll maps which are now available 
give real-time pictures of events that were not 
available until only a few years ago.  It would 
be helpful if the size of the phytoplankton 
could also be measured from space through 
some light-scattering device. 
• The Argo program for examining the physical 
structure of the world’s oceans with profiling 
CTDs is another advancement of great benefit 
to biological oceanographers. 
• DNA analysis can be used by oceanographers 
in many ways; for example, in the correct 
identification of species and the tracing of 
discrete fish stocks. 
• Automated oceanographic buoys need to be 
employed extensively throughout the oceans 
to continually monitor many biological, 
chemical and physical parameters.  
These are but a few examples of new methods that 
will give biologists better time/space data 
coverage of the oceans.  I would like to add in 
conclusion to this section, that many of these data 
can only be collected through international co-
operation.  This is where organisations, such as the 
North Pacific Marine Science Organization 
(PICES), can play a vital role in ocean exploration.  
 
Models 
 
There are many different models that can be 
applied to marine ecosystems depending on 
whether one is modelling the dispersion of a 
pollutant, species migrations, food chains, food 
webs, including or excluding physical forcing 
functions, and so on.  Steele’s (1962) pioneering 
work on trophodynamics, Ryther’s (1969) food 
chain examination of fish production, and Odum’s 
(1967) biological circuitry models were among the 
first ecosystem models.  Much larger models that 
include physical forcing of the ecosystem, such as 
the European Regional Seas Model (ERSEM – 
Baretta et al. 1995), have developed over the years 
together with more complex models dealing 
primarily with trophic interactions (e.g., Ecopath, 
Polovina 1984).  What is the optimal size of an 
ecosystem model?  When the question being asked 
is very specific, such as in the case of carbon 
dioxide flux, then the model can be relatively 
simple (e.g., Woods and Barkmann 1993).  Or in 
the case of fisheries, in order to keep models 
manageable, they should be written to deal with 
specific parts of the ecosystem, such as that 
described by Robinson and Ware (1994) for an 
upwelling system and four species of fish. 
Complex models are not necessarily better than 
simple models. 
 
For the estimation of “carrying capacity” and for 
some aspects of climate change, models based on 
size relationships (e.g., Sheldon et al. 1982) may 
be sufficient to give useful predictions for regional 
forecasts.  Such models have the advantage of 
being largely independent of species identification 
which is especially helpful for the plankton 
community, while at the other end of the spectrum, 
fish catch can be analysed in terms of the size of 
fish required (i.e., a large biomass of small fish or 
a smaller biomass of large fish).  
 
 
  
In addition to the concepts above, genetic change 
may also need to be added to some models (see 
Grant and Waples 2000).  This becomes especially 
important when one considers that a fishery is 
often inadvertently selecting for particular genetic 
characteristics (e.g., size). 
 
Biological coefficients 
 
In formulating equations for trophodynamic 
studies, it is necessary to research the values used 
for biological coefficients in various relationships. 
This includes determining and revising different 
forcing, physiological and phasing functions as 
defined in Lalli and Parsons (1999).  Many of 
these values are fairly well known for the 
phytoplankton community such as the parameters 
of the P vs I curve.  However, for higher trophic 
levels there is a need to research many 
relationships.  For example, how turbulence and 
mixing interacts with the plankton and fish 
community is not fully known.  
 
As another example, I believe that one very 
important number to study is ecological efficiency. 
In a paper by Pauly and Christensen (1995, Fig. 2), 
the authors chose a number for the transfer 
efficiency by surveying the literature for the most 
commonly used value.  Since most of these values 
were not determined independently, a great deal of 
copying of a 10% value had occurred (probably 
based on a paper by Slobodkin, 1961), and this 
value was then assumed to be the most probably 
correct value for the authors to use in their 
discussion.  As Baumann (1995) pointed out, 
choosing the most popular value of 10 % is not 
justification of its validity.  The transfer efficiency 
derives its name from the useful concept of how 
much energy or biomass is transferred between 
trophic levels.  It is really better thought of as the 
ecological efficiency (E), which is defined the 
same way.  (However, some authors have used the 
term “transfer efficiency” to indicate the ratio of 
primary to secondary production, which is really 
only an indicator of the ecological efficiency;  for 
small differences in these terms, see Parsons et al. 
(1988). 
 
The ecological efficiency is equal to the multiple 
of the growth efficiency (K) and the ecotrophic 
efficiency (E
c
), and it has been pointed out 
(Parsons et al. 1988) that, for many aquatic 
organisms, growth efficiencies are of the order of 
30% and the amount of lower trophic levels 
consumed annually (E
c
) is at least 80%.  Thus one 
would expect ecological efficiencies in the sea to 
be closer to 20% than the popular figure of 10%. 
Recent discussion of the high ecotrophic 
efficiency in aquatic habitats is given by Cyr and 
Pace (1993), and there are a number of 
independent estimates of ecological efficiencies 
(e.g., Sheldon et al. 1977;  Iverson 1990;  Gaedke 
and Straile 1994;  Parsons and Chen 1994), all of 
which generally indicate values >15%.  A more 
detailed account of this discussion is given in 
Parsons and Lalli (1988), and I suggest that this is 
an example of the kind of physiological value that 
is widely used, but poorly known, and which 
therefore requires some fundamental research.  
 
The need to accurately know the various 
biological coefficients that are used in models is 
an on-going problem that requires maximum 
cooperation between the experimental physiologist 
and the field oceanographer. 
 
Ecosystem structure 
 
It is apparent that a large amount of marine 
biomass is being excluded from ecosystem studies, 
either because there are no data on some parts of 
the food chain, or because traditional focus has 
always been towards commercially exploitable 
predators.  Thus there are few studies leading to 
ecosystems models, which include the jellyfish of 
the sea, non-commercial fishes and migratory 
mesopelagic fishes.  Further quantification is 
needed of the bacterial loop  (e.g., Azam et al. 
1991).  In particular, the recycling of 
photosynthetic products (see Kirchman 2000, for 
review) now appears to be very important in some 
environments where the whole ecosystem may 
depend on the recycling.  With anywhere from 10
5
 
to 10
9
 bacteria per ml of seawater, it almost 
appears that their previously neglected role in 
holding the food chain of the sea together might be 
crudely analogous to the missing dark matter in 
the universe.  Bacterial cycles will also require 
more information on the role of zooflagellates 
(e.g., Fenchel 1982).  In addition, the dynamics of 
viral response to an algal bloom (e.g., Yager et al. 
2001) needs to be understood under different 
 
  
oceanic conditions.  The pelagic/benthic boundary 
layer (e.g., Smith et al. 2001) forms another area 
for which much more understanding is required, 
particularly in connection with the large fisheries 
in the continental seas.  The inclusion of more 
biology in our concept of ecosystem structure 
appears to me to be essential for the future. 
 
Another problem in studying ecosystem structure 
is to keep in mind that more than one set of 
environmental factors can give the same result.  
An example of this is in the physiological 
dynamics of phytoplankton blooms (Parsons and 
Takahashi 1973).  It can be shown, for example, 
that phytoplankton ecology may be dominated by 
flagellates under conditions of deep mixed water 
columns and low light, and also under conditions 
of stable water columns with low nutrients, and 
under conditions of eutrophication when silicate 
may limit diatom growth.  There is often, 
therefore, no single explanation for ecological 
phenomena;  cause and effect may be proportioned 
to a number of causative agents. 
 
The relationship between plankton distributions 
and small-scale physical disturbance has recently 
thrown some light on how animals manage to 
graze particulate matter when it is so sparsely 
distributed.  While the concentration of prey items 
has been easily measured, it now appears that the 
aggregation of prey (i.e., patchy distrubtion) is just 
as important a number as the concentration.  The 
effects of small-scale turbulence summarised by 
Seuront (2001) are  (1) to increase the rate of the 
nutrient flux around non-motile phytoplankton 
cells, (2) to decrease the physical coagulation of 
phytoplankton cells, and (3) to increase 
predator/prey encounter rates.  Processes involved 
with aggregation and physical turbulence need to 
be studied further (e.g., Incze et al. 2001).   
 
 
Conclusion 
 
In conclusion, I have tried to emphasise that 
biological oceanography, including the fish of the 
sea, is still a young science.  We need to collect 
much more data using new techniques, and we 
need to learn how to better integrate our results 
into dynamic models.  My talk has emphasised the 
ecosystem approach as being a focal point of 
biological oceanographic studies, but this is not 
intended to distract from studies on species or 
communities, which I would tend to describe 
under the different heading of marine biology.  In 
the field pertaining directly to fisheries science, 
there is no ‘quick fix’ via inadequate biological 
models.  Fisheries science as part of biological 
oceanographic studies will only advance if it 
engages in fundamental studies on ocean 
ecosystems.

Introduction 
 
The city of Victoria was the venue for the first and 
tenth anniversary meetings of PICES.  This city 
has many reminders of its origins in the British 
Empire, and these illustrate an element of PICES.  
Within 100 m of the Conference Centre, there are 
statues and references to Rudyard Kipling, a 
British Nobel laureate poet who became symbolic 
of the British Empire.  Perhaps his most famous 
line is from the “Ballad of East and West” which 
begins:  “OH, East is East and West is West, and 
never the twain shall meet,…”.  The “twain” was 
the supposed cultural discontinuity between the 
east and west that Kipling thought was so great it 
would never be bridged.  Clearly, the sentiments 
of this line do not apply to PICES.  During the first 
ten years of PICES, east has met west, repeatedly 
and successfully - and this is an excellent 
achievement of PICES.  On the other hand, some 
might say that within PICES there still are a 
number of “twains”, unrelated to “east” or “west”, 
that have yet to be bridged, especially inter-
disciplinary differences in perception and outlook 
among physical and biological oceanographers 
and fisheries biologists.  In this report we make 
references to these differences, as we try to 
provide both a critical and constructive review of 
fisheries science in PICES.  We acknowledge the 
many accomplishments of PICES but we also 
comment on its deficiencies.  We conclude with a 
suggestion that the Organization should re-
examine its roots and mandate, and ask how 
PICES can respond to meet the developing 
challenges of marine science. 
 
In our opinion, an introspective re-evaluation of 
PICES is warranted at this time and we provide a 
justification from a fisheries perspective.  In the 
ten years since PICES formed, many fisheries 
throughout the world have unexpectedly 
destabilized.  In a sense, as fisheries scientists, we 
did not get much right in fisheries management in 
the 1990s.  Some stocks collapsed while others 
increased, sometimes dramatically.  Well-known 
examples would include declines and/or recoveries 
of Pacific salmon, groundfish species, the 
California sardine and Japanese sardine.  Of 
course, fish stock declines are well-known in other 
parts of the world, but the extent of change in the 
world’s marine fish stocks may be greater than is 
realized.  This assertion is based on the 
observation that there are a number of instances 
where massive changes have occurred among 
smaller or less-well-known stocks, including, for 
example, several species of smelts (Osmeridae) in 
the North Pacific.  New revelations on the concept 
of decadal-scale regimes and how they might 
affect fisheries have emerged (Steele 1996) and 
calls for ecosystem-based management have 
 
  
increased (NRC 1999;  NMFS 1999).  Some of the 
recent changes in fisheries have had large social 
and economic impacts.  In British Columbia, 
changes in fisheries have devastated some coastal 
communities, of which many are First Nations.  In 
Canada, and elsewhere, fisheries management 
agencies and scientists have been subjected to 
intense criticism.  In this report, we suggest that 
organisations like PICES could do much more to 
bring more reliable information to those who want 
to better understand the issues. 
 
PICES is a key scientific organization in the North 
Pacific, and the Fishery Science Committee (FIS) 
is the main structural component of fisheries 
science within PICES.  First we ask about PICES:  
“what has PICES done to help clarify or assist 
with solutions to these problems in marine 
resources?”  Second, we ask of FIS:  “has FIS 
done anything in the last decade that will make a 
difference?”  We cannot provide a definitive 
answer to either question, but we attempt the 
following:  (i) for the question about PICES 
activities, we examine the existing structure of 
PICES and evaluate this against what the original 
founders of PICES indicated that PICES should do 
about fisheries science;  (ii) for the question about 
FIS activities, we present a brief history of FIS in 
PICES and compare the effort and results of FIS 
activities in PICES with those of other Scientific 
Committees.  
 
We test three hypotheses.  Hypothesis 1:  time 
devoted to FIS issues at Annual Meetings is lower 
than that of other Scientific Committees (POC - 
Physical Oceanography and Climate, BIO - 
Biological Oceanography, MEQ - Marine 
Environmental Quality).  Hypothesis 2:  time 
devoted to FIS issues at Annual Meetings is 
decreasing in recent years (relative to that of other 
Scientific Committees.  Hypothesis 3:  the 
numbers of pages of scientific reports devoted to 
issues of concern to FIS is lower than those 
devoted to other Scientific Committees.  Also, we 
review the main objectives of PICES, as set out in 
the founding statutes, and provide an evaluation of 
the first ten years of PICES activities against these 
objectives.  Then we briefly compare the structure 
of PICES with the Atlantic counterpart 
organization, ICES.  We conclude with some 
suggestions for modifications in the structure and 
function of PICES, and FIS activities in PICES, 
and general PICES activities for the next decade.  
 
Methods and materials 
 
Data and information sources   
 
We used PICES Annual Reports that provide 
minutes of all FIS meetings since 1994 (see 
references to “PICES”).  This information was 
supplemented by references to some PICES 
Scientific Reports and Wooster and Callahan 
(1994). 
 
Tests of hypotheses   
 
To test the first and second hypotheses, we 
classified and quantified FIS activities at Annual 
Meetings (topics, symposia, working groups) 
based on analysis of PICES meeting schedules 
from 1993 to 2001 (see PICES Abstracts in 
references).  The quantification was limited to 
time within formal meetings, so sessions hosted by 
CCCC Task Teams (REX, BASS and MODEL) 
were not included, but CCCC and Science Board 
(SB) were included (see below for more 
explanation of GLOBEC, also Perry et al., this 
volume).  We estimated the sum of time (hrs) 
devoted to each Scientific Committee including 
FIS.  The cumulative hours for each session 
(usually in units of 4 hours, so one 8-hour day = 
two 4-hour sessions) were summed for each year 
from 1993 to 2001.  We quantified the cumulative 
hours of “fishery science” topics presented by 
other groups, including some for BIO, POC, MEQ 
and CCCC.  We compared FIS to other 
committees and activities.  We used Excel 
spreadsheets to record the data.  Data were 
analysed with Minitab© software. 
 
To test the third hypothesis we reviewed all 
scientific publications from PICES and estimated 
the number of pages devoted to subject matter of 
interest to each committee.  This included all 
PICES Scientific Reports and special publications 
of selected papers presented at various meetings 
organized and co-sponsored by PICES.  We 
classified the content of the papers according to 
whether the subject material was, or was not, of 
direct relevance to fishery science.  When a paper 
was clearly of interest to fishery science plus 
 
  
another subject area, such as physical 
oceanography, we counted the entire paper as of 
interest to fishery science.  
 
Review of PICES activities 
 
To evaluate present PICES activities with those 
suggested by the founders of PICES, we consulted 
the key publication “The PICES papers” (Wooster 
and Callahan 1994) that provides a brief scientific 
history of PICES, and presents the main tenets of 
the scientific objectives of the Organization.   
 
Contrasting PICES to other organizations 
 
As a guide to what PICES structure, function and 
activities could occur, we briefly examine the 
present structure of ICES, the namesake 
organization in the Atlantic and a clear model for 
development of the basic structure of PICES 
during the formative stages in the 1980s.  Also, we 
briefly comment on the structure and function of 
some of the other scientific organizations in the 
North Pacific, and on how these organizations 
interface with PICES.   
 
Results 
 
A short history of FIS in PICES 
 
The Fishery Science Committee was initiated in 
October 15, 1992, with Danuel M. Ware (Canada) 
named as the first Chairman.  Members were from 
four member nations:  Canada, Japan, People’s 
Republic of China and U.S.A.  In October 1993, 
Qi-Sheng Tang (China) became the second 
Chairman of FIS.  In that year the first FIS 
Working Group (WG 3) on “Dynamics of small 
pelagics in coastal ecosystems” was formed, 
chaired jointly by John Hunter (U.S.A.) and Tokio 
Wada (Japan).  By 1995, Republic of Korea and 
Russia joined PICES, and additional members 
joined FIS.  Working Group 3 presented their final 
report.  In 1996, Chang-Ik Zhang (Korea) became 
the third Chairman of FIS and a new WG 12 on 
“Crabs and shrimps” was formed with Robert S. 
Otto (U.S.A.) and Vitaly E. Rodin (Russia) as Co-
Chairmen.  In 1999, Douglas E. Hay  (Canada) 
became the fourth Chairman and in 2000, a third 
WG 16 was formed on “Climate change, shifts in 
fish production and fisheries management” with 
Richard J. Beamish (Canada) and Tokio Wada 
(Japan) as Co-Chairmen.  In 2001, the WG 12 
report was completed.  During this period the FIS 
Committee developed many scientific sessions, 
sometimes held in co-operation with other 
Scientific Committees (see below).  FIS also 
sponsored special meetings and symposia that led 
to a number of scientific reports (see below).   
 
FIS activities in PICES 
 
The main activities of FIS in PICES have been:  
(a) the development of symposia and topic 
sessions, sometimes in conjunction with other 
Scientific Committees;  (b) supporting specific 
Working Groups, usually with a term of 3 years, to 
address and prepare a report considered of key 
interest to PICES;  (c) convening special meetings 
of FIS usually during Annual Meetings, to discuss 
and report on fishery science issues.  The minutes 
of all meetings are recorded in the PICES Annual 
Reports.  
 
Since 1994, FIS sponsored one or more topic 
sessions each year, sometimes in co-operation 
with other Scientific Committees (Table 1).  
Topics varied widely and represent more than 75 
hours of scientific presentations.  Since its 
inception, FIS has established three Working 
Groups, of which the results for two are complete, 
while the third is in progress.  A forth Working 
Group has been proposed to start later in 2002.  
The dates, topics and Chairmen of the Working 
Groups are shown in Table 2.  FIS has sponsored 
publications such as special volumes in Progress 
in Oceanography (Beamish et al. 1999 and 
McKinnell et al. 2001) and by Alaska Sea Grant 
(Loughlin and Ohtani 1999).  The list of pages 
corresponding to FIS-sponsored reports within the 
PICES Scientific Report (PSR) Series, showing 
the approximate number of pages related is shown 
in Table 3.

year.  The total time for all PICES sessions, however, has steadily increased with time until 1999-2001, 
when it remained at about 70 hours.  This increase is mainly related to the inclusion of sessions associated 
with GLOBES activities, especially the CCCC sessions.

were relatively constant at 10-12 hours, or 
approximately one-quarter of the total session time 
for all Committees.  The hours for all PICES 
sessions, however, has increased - reflecting 
developments of special Science Board symposia 
and inclusion of sessions and symposia associated 
with the CCCC Program.  These two items have 
accounted for almost half of the PICES Annual 
Meetings in recent years.  When expressed as a 
percentage of total time at meetings, FIS topics 
decreased since the First Annual Meeting (Fig. 2), 
but this same trend is seen for all Committees.  
This decrease is not associated with a reduction in 
FIS activities, rather it is an increase in total 
PICES activities during Annual Meetings. 
 
There is a total of about 2,670 published pages of 
PICES scientific reports, of which about 700 are 
derived from FIS topics (Table 3).  In contrast, the 
number of POC pages is about 900, slightly 
greater but not by much.  Therefore, from the data 
shown in Table 3, which are only approximate, 
one could not conclude that publications of FIS 
topics were severely under-represented, relative to 
other Scientific Committees in PICES.   
 
We maintain, however, that to have all fishery 
science represented by a single Scientific 
Committee with only one-quarter of all the 
scientific sessions, is a severe under-representation 
of the marine science composition of member 
countries.  The remedy for this is the expansion of 
fishery science activity in PICES.

The vision and objectives of PICES:  Review and 
evaluation of the first ten years 
 
Several key original scientific tenets of PICES, as 
prepared by its founders are shown below, 
followed by an evaluation (in italics).  
 
The general purpose of the Organization as stated 
in Article III of the PICES Convention shall be:   
 
(a) to promote and co-ordinate marine scientific 
research in order to advance scientific knowledge 
of the Convention area (i.e., North Pacific) and of 
its living resources, including but not necessarily 
limited to research with respect to the ocean 
environment and its interactions with land and 
atmosphere, its role in and response to global 
weather and climate change, its flora, fauna and 
ecosystems, its uses and resources, and impacts 
upon it from human activities;  and  
Evaluation:  To our knowledge, aside from the 
exchange of information at PICES Annual 
Meetings, relatively little dedicated activity has 
occurred in this regard, especially in FIS issues. 
(We comment further on this below.) 
 
 
  
(b) to promote the collection and exchange of 
information and data related to marine scientific 
research in the Convention Area. 
Evaluation:  To our knowledge, there has been 
little collection and exchange of fisheries 
information occurring directly as a result of 
PICES, although the current FIS WG 16 will 
address this issue.  This issue will also be 
addressed in some GLOBEC-type activities, of 
which PICES is a keen sponsor.  
 
More specific objectives of PICES are indicated in 
Article V (Functions of the Governing Council 
Organization).  The original documents do not 
identify the Fishery Science Committee, 
specifically, as charged with the task of achieving 
PICES objectives, because the structure of PICES 
was not established.  In fact, the scientific 
administrative structure was not defined beyond 
the requirement for a “Scientific Board”.  The FIS 
Committee, as a member of the Science Board, is 
the organizational component that advises and 
implements the directives of the Governing 
Council relative to fisheries activities.  Part 1 of 
Article V states that the scientific functions of the 
Governing Council shall be: 
 
(a) to identify research priorities and problems 
pertaining to the area concerned (i.e., North 
Pacific) as well as appropriate methods for their 
solution;  
Evaluation:  To our knowledge, such has yet to be 
prepared.  There are lists of research priorities, 
however, for small pelagics (from FIS WG 3) and 
crabs and shrimps (from FIS WG 12).   
 
(b) to recommend co-ordinated research programs 
and related activities pertaining to the area 
concerned, which shall be undertaken through the 
national efforts of the participating Contracting 
Parties; 
Evaluation:  To our knowledge there has been 
little attempt to develop co-ordinated international 
research field programs.  Some limited programs 
may have occurred, but such programs, when they 
do take place, might have happened in the absence 
of PICES (through bilateral agreements, etc.), or, 
through related initiatives, such as programs 
fostered through GLOBEC initiatives.  In this 
sense, it may be unfair to conclude that there has 
been no PICES role in such programs, but 
probably it is accurate to conclude that relatively 
little internationally co-ordinated research has 
emanated directly from PICES, especially in 
fisheries.  
 
(c) to promote and facilitate the exchange of 
scientific data, information and personnel; 
Evaluation:  To our knowledge relatively little 
exchange of scientific data in fisheries has 
occurred directly, and no exchange of scientific 
personnel as a result of PICES activity.  Probably 
the main reason for these shortcomings is related 
to limited funds.  
 
(d) to consider requests to develop scientific 
advice pertaining to the area concerned; 
Evaluation:  To our knowledge, PICES has not yet 
received any requests to provide scientific advice 
to member governments or any other agency. 
 
(e) to organize scientific symposia and other 
scientific events;  and 
Evaluation:  Without doubt, the organization of 
scientific meetings has been a successful aspect of 
PICES.  The last decade has seen the development 
of a first rate scientific meeting that accompanies 
the Annual Meeting.  The scientific meetings are 
successful, in part because of a vibrant mixture of 
disciplines, including oceanography and fisheries.  
We endorse this activity, and encourage more 
interactions - with the qualification that the 
objective should be to provide meaningful, useful 
scientific information in support of fisheries 
issues.  This is an important point, because we 
note that the Annual Meeting is the foremost 
scientific activity of PICES.  If important issues in 
fishery science are not addressed in the next ten 
years, in a way that can make a difference to how 
we understand and conduct fisheries in the North 
Pacific, then PICES may have little to justify its 
continued existence.  
 
(f) to foster the discussion of problems of mutual 
interest.   
Evaluation:  To our knowledge, little discussion 
has occurred except within the context of Annual 
Meetings.  It is possible, however, that some 
aspects of this original objective have been 
achieved by the FIS Working Groups.  Clearly, 
however, there is much more that could be done to 
meet this original objective.   
 
  
Discussion 
 
Successes of PICES 
 
We acknowledge the fine achievements of PICES.  
The Annual Meetings have developed into first 
rate international scientific meetings.  Further, the 
PICES Secretariat has done a superb job of 
producing high-quality scientific publications in a 
timely manner.  Our position is, however, that 
fishery science is under-represented in PICES, and 
we recommend expanding its role in the 
Organization.  We emphasize that we are 
advocating an “expansion”, not a re-apportionment 
of existing resources.  We do not advocate that 
such an expansion should occur at the expense of 
existing committees or activities. We acknowledge 
and salute the developing inter-disciplinary 
rapport between fishery science and other 
disciplines.  Continued development is essential 
for the future of PICES.  
  
Fishery science in PICES - a contrast to ICES 
 
Clearly, the name and structure of PICES were 
modelled after ICES (the acronym for the original 
Atlantic organization:  International Council for 
the Exploration of the Sea).  The structures are 
similar in the sense that ICES is a scientific 
organization, consisting of scientific committees 
and working groups, and which holds annual 
scientific meetings, etc.  There are, however, some 
key differences.  Among 4 Scientific Committees, 
PICES has a single Fishery Science Committee 
and two Oceanographic Committees.  ICES 
consists of 7 scientific committees, of which there 
is only a single oceanographic committee and 
fishery science activities could occur in 4 or more 
of the standing scientific committees.  As a 
consequence the profile of fisheries matters is 
much higher in ICES than PICES.  ICES also has 
a distinct advisory role that does not occur in 
PICES.  A review of ICES documents shows that 
there are 3 advisory committees and much of the 
working group activity is directed towards specific 
assessment activities.  Another difference between 
PICES and ICES is that ICES working groups are 
not limited to a 3-year term, which appears to be 
the norm for PICES.  This restriction, however, is 
not one specified in the original statutes.  
Therefore it is clear that the content and profile of 
fishery science in ICES is substantially greater 
than that of PICES.  In some ways this seems odd, 
because fisheries matters always appeared to be a 
prominent justification for the initial developments 
of PICES (Wooster and Callahan 1994).  
 
In the last 5-6 years, PICES has opted to work 
closely with GLOBEC, and started the CCCC 
(four C's) Program (referring to “Climate Change 
and Carrying Capacity”).  Within PICES this 
consists of 4 Task Teams (REX-Regional 
experiments), BASS (Basin Scale experiments), 
MODEL (an oceanographic and biological 
modelling initiative) and MONITOR.  The CCCC 
Program is represented by two participants on the 
PICES Science Board, and in that respect, has 
input to the direction of PICES.  We also note that 
the NPAFC (North Pacific Anadromous Fish 
Commission) with member countries of Canada, 
Japan, Russia and the U.S.A., serves as an 
observer in PICES with respect to international 
regulation and concern about salmonids.  
 
Present profile of fishery science in PICES 
 
Compared to ICES, the role of fishery science in 
PICES is not high, although specific concerns 
about the diminishment of fishery science, relative 
to that of other Scientific Committees, is not 
justified.  That is, the level of participation of FIS 
(as measured by the number of hours of scientific 
presentations, or the numbers of pages of scientific 
reports) is approximately equal to that of other 
Committees.  Further, there is no justification for 
concern that contributions of the FIS Committee 
are declining with time.  Indeed, there “appears” to 
be a relative decline in contribution within 
scientific meetings, but such a decline has 
occurred among all Scientific Committees and is 
mainly related to the incorporation of GLOBEC-
like activities into PICES.  
 
Increasing the profile and expanding the role of 
fishery science in PICES - suggestions 
 
There are a number of ways to increase fishery 
science profiles and activities in PICES, and we 
list only a few general suggestions.  For instance, 
the PICES Science Board could add an additional 
committee, or two, that is focussed on issues of 
fishery science.  One such committee could be an 
 
  
aquaculture committee, a suggestion endorsed 
informally by several countries, as aquaculture is a 
topic of major concern to most member nations.  
Such a committee could also provide strong future 
linkages to MEQ activities.  There are, however, 
many possible committees that could be added.   
 
An alternate suggestion would be to add a second 
member, from the Fishery Science Committee, to 
the Science Board, and proportionally expand (i.e., 
approximately double) the time given to fishery 
science issues in Annual Meetings.  A concern 
with this approach, however, is that the Annual 
Meetings are already long (4-5 days) and packed 
with concurrent sessions.  Perhaps a more viable 
suggestion would be to increase the support for 
Working Groups sponsored by the FIS.  Further, 
such Working Groups could be encouraged to hold 
some smaller, inter-sessional meetings on 
specialized topics, leading to PICES publications.   
 
PICES should also examine its relationships with 
the national members to stimulate greater 
participation.  Many participants in PICES 
meetings use the Annual Meeting as a venue to 
present and discuss their own research, but the 
time available to become involved in collaborative 
PICES activities is limited due to the pressure of 
work at their own institutions or agencies.  PICES 
should work to impress upon the agencies, and 
representatives of the member nations, the 
importance of PICES initiatives such as Working 
Groups to assure that the scientific manpower 
required for these efforts can better be met.  If 
successful, this would go a long way towards 
improving cooperative work in fisheries. 
 
What more should FIS and PICES do?  
 
Finally our general conclusion is that while PICES 
can be proud of its first decade of life, because in 
many ways it did a good job, however, it did not 
fulfil all of the key objectives and visions of the 
founders of PICES.  Overall the activities of 
PICES were not enough;  they were not sufficient 
to address issues of great concern and 
misunderstanding on global fisheries issues.   
 
At the operational level, PICES should develop 
better adherence to the Article V of the PICES 
Convention.  Specifically, three parts of Article V 
need attention:   
 
(a) to identify research priorities and problems 
pertaining to the area concerned (i.e., North 
Pacific) as well as appropriate methods for their 
solution;  
(b) to recommend co-ordinated research 
programs and related activities pertaining to the 
area concerned, which shall be undertaken 
through the national efforts of the participating 
Contracting Parties; 
(c) to promote and facilitate the exchange of 
scientific data, information and personnel; 
 
Item (a) could be addressed with a working group 
or other approaches;  item (b) is expensive and 
difficult because many national governments are  
struggling to support their vital national programs 
- and may have little sympathy for co-operative 
international field programs that may jeopardise 
national activities.  Item (c), however, is 
fundamental and relatively inexpensive.  It is not 
difficult or expensive to develop exchanges of 
scientific personnel.  The results have broad 
benefits both for the scientists and the host 
organization and countries.  PICES could also play 
a role in improving fisheries data shortcomings 
identified in the North Pacific (e.g., Watson and 
Pauly 2001).  This would be particularly valuable 
because resulting scientific products are expanded 
into international databases.  In this regard, we 
should point out that PICES fishery science should 
take a page from our ICES colleagues, who have 
now presented extensive fisheries databases on the 
web.  Indeed, we might also learn from our 
oceanographic colleagues who also make their 
data accessible on web sites.  We must begin to do 
the same with fisheries data.  The PICES 
Secretariat, and PICES web site, are obvious 
choices for this proposed development.  Therefore 
PICES could consider substantial expansion of its 
website, to meet some of the original objectives of 
the PICES founders.  Specifically, an expanded 
PICES website would be an ideal solution to 
addressing Article 5c - exchange of scientific data 
and information. 
 
An additional approach would be to develop much 
stronger links with existing marine science  
 
 
  
organizations operating in the North Pacific.  
Specifically, we suggest that there could be much 
stronger linkages with the North Pacific 
Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC).  This 
organization consists of four member countries 
(Canada, Japan, Russia and the U.S.A.) that are 
also PICES members.  Stronger linkages could be 
forged by developing more joint participation (not 
just representation) at annual and interim 
meetings.  Linkages with NPAFC, and other 
organizations, could develop into jointly 
configured standing committees or working 
groups that would be capable of reviewing 
scientific information and providing advice.  In 
this regard, if PICES were able to develop the 
capacity to provide meaningful review, 
information and advice on the non-salmonid fish 
species within its mandate area, the way that 
NPAFC does for salmonids, then it would become 
a much more useful and meaningful organization.  
Such issues are of keen interest, not only to 
scientists, but also to the tens of millions of people 
who make their living from the sea, throughout 
coastal regions of the North Pacific Ocean.   
 
Aside from organization modifications, what else 
could we do?  What should we do?  In a nutshell, 
we need to communicate more broadly outside of 
PICES and broadcast the extent of our collective 
ignorance - of fishery science in particular and 
marine science in general.  We need to advise 
those among the non-scientific community and 
especially the decision- and policy-makers, that 
we (PICES fishery scientists) do not know the 
answers to many of the key issues affecting marine 
fish - indeed we do not even know many of the 
appropriate questions.  Put another way, we need 
to spend as much energy explaining what we do 
not know, as what we do know.  The systems we 
study, usually with inadequate resources, are vast 
and complex.  Our understanding is insufficient. 
We suggest that we need to improve the general 
understanding about marine systems - including 
our abilities and limitations.

The history of MEQ and its Working Groups 
 
The North Pacific Marine Science Organization — 
PICES — was envisaged as long ago as the late 
1970s, and an organizational structure was 
negotiated in 1987.  The first scientific plans for 
the Marine Environmental Quality Committee 
(MEQ) were outlined at a PICES Scientific 
Workshop held in December 1991, in Seattle.  In a 
review of that workshop, presented at the PICES 
First Annual Meeting (PICES I) in 1992, Dr. Usha 
Varanasi from the U.S.A. identified five research 
issues of importance:  
• nutrient loading and eutrophication,  
• chronic and persistent chemical pollutants (all 
high priority issues and of lower priority), 
• the role of the North Pacific in waste disposal,  
• large scale environmental impacts, and  
• biological community impacts due to 
exploitation.   
 
Following discussions at PICES I (Victoria, 
Canada), the MEQ report to the PICES Science 
Board re-cast these priorities identifying two 
topics as being particularly important:  
• harmful algal blooms (HAB), and  
• chemical and biological contaminants.  
 
However, the discussions at PICES I had 
obviously ranged fairly widely.  It was recognized, 
for example, that the focus of most member 
countries was on coastal rather than “open ocean” 
pollution.  This issue of whether MEQ should 
focus its efforts within PICES on coastal or on 
open ocean is not fully resolved even now.  There 
was also some discussion about need for 
calibration of environmental assessments under 
the heading of “common assessment 
methodology”.  It had been suggested that MEQ 
should select: 
• suitable species for monitoring of the status 
and trends in fate and effects of chemical 
contaminants in the North Pacific, and  
• a suite of chemicals or other environmental 
pollution-related phenomena for the open 
ocean that would be related to effects on 
indicator species.   
 
The Committee recommended that a scientific 
session of MEQ at the next Annual Meeting should 
focus on “Assessment techniques and methodology 
in MEQ”, with an emphasis on two main issues:  
HAB and chemical and biological contaminants.  
Partly in response to these discussions, the PICES 
Governing Council established a Working Group 2 
(WG 2) to formulate approaches to the 
“Development of common assessment 
methodology for marine pollution” under the 
auspices of MEQ.   
 
The “science” activities of MEQ began seriously 
at PICES II (Seattle, U.S.A.) in 1993, with WG 2’s 
first meeting.  Background papers had been 
solicited from all member countries (at that time, 
Canada, Japan, People’s Republic of China, and 
U.S.A.), summarising their concerns about marine 
pollution.  “Pollution” had been interpreted to 
cover a wide range of stresses, not just chemical 
contamination, but also pathogens, HABs, etc.  As 
noted above, most countries focussed on coastal 
rather than open ocean concerns, because the 
coastal zone is where many human activities have 
their most direct impact.  The reports noted that 
the chemicals of concern were persistent organic 
pollutants (e.g., PCBs, DDTs, dioxins), metals, 
oil-related compounds (e.g., polynuclear aromatic  
 
 
  
hydrocarbons, PAH) and radionuclides, but there 
was a growing interest in eutrophication and 
harmful algal blooms. 
 
WG 2 recommended that PICES:  
• organize a session to review approaches to 
assessing the impact of stressors at the 
ecosystem level, and  
• sponsor a practical workshop to address some 
of these issues.   
This recommendation was endorsed by MEQ at 
PICES II.  The approach proposed was to convene 
a session at PICES III (Nemuro, Japan) to discuss 
how to measure biological impacts, and to outline 
the organization of the practical workshop.  This 
was also endorsed by MEQ but with much 
discussion about where a workshop should (or 
could) be held, and what problems it would 
address.  Ideally, MEQ would look for a site to 
hold the workshop where problems existed that 
were of interest to all member countries.  Site 
selection was important because the location for 
the workshop needed:  (1) to afford the 
opportunity to have maximum participation by 
scientists from member countries, (2) have been 
studied previously so that selection of actual 
sampling sites would afford the types of samples 
necessary to test and compare different biological 
and chemical assessment techniques.  The latter 
was critical, because the longer-term goal was to 
work towards harmonization of assessment 
methodologies used by PICES member countries.  
Harmonization is a key factor in improving inter-
comparability among studies.  Without the ability 
to use results from multiple studies with a known 
degree of confidence, scientists are severely 
limited in making trans-Pacific assessments of the 
status and trends in chemical contaminant levels in 
marine biota, much less assessments of relative 
magnitudes of biological effects in indicator 
species. 
 
The MEQ session at PICES III had as its theme 
“Interdisclipinary methodology to better assess 
and predict the impact of pollutants on structure 
and function of marine ecosystems”;  11 papers 
were presented on various approaches to the 
subject.  Many of these focused on the relationship 
between the presence of contaminants and their 
effects on organisms at the biochemical, or whole 
organism, level or on communities.  There was 
general agreement that chemical analyses and 
biological effects measurements were each 
valuable by themselves, but were of considerably 
more value when combined.  A future practical 
workshop should build upon this theme, and 
ideally should be held in the western Pacific area.  
Also at PICES III there was considerable 
discussion around the issue of the scale at which 
MEQ should focus with regard to human impacts 
to marine environmental quality.  The discussion 
centered on the question of what stressors could 
have the biggest impact on the ecological 
processes of the North Pacific?  The discussion 
ranged from changes in hydrologic regimes of 
rivers and their consequences to coastal areas, to 
climate change and long-range transport of 
pollutants. The international Arctic Monitoring 
and Assessment Program (AMAP) was providing 
solid evidence that long-range transport of certain 
persistent organic pollutants (“POPs”) was the 
major source of these contaminants to Arctic 
ecosystems.  In addition, there was preliminary 
evidence of a trans-Pacific transport (west to east) 
of pollutants associated with combustion of fossil 
fuels (e.g., NO
x 
and
 
SO
x
), and that they could be 
affecting relatively pristine forest ecosystems of 
the Pacific Northwest. 
 
One consequence of these two issues was a major 
change in the direction of WG 2. Whereas 
previously it had focused on “development of 
common assessment methodology”, WG 2 now 
proposed to amend its terms of reference to  
(a) draft a work plan for a workshop in the East 
China Sea area (probably focusing on the impact 
of the Three Gorges project);  and (b) to put the 
workshop in place by 1997.  The Three Gorges 
Project would lead to a major change in the 
sediment budget to the South China Sea;  the 
impact could be substantial.  While this project 
could have considerable ecological impact on 
marine waters of the PICES region, conducting a 
scientific study related to the project was felt by 
many to be very challenging.  Perhaps more than 
for any other committee in PICES, MEQ, through 
its scientific work, most directly addresses issues 
that are controversial and can bring attention to the 
ecological impacts of human actions.  MEQ 
endorsed this proposal while recognizing the 
challenges, and WG 2 was re-cast as WG 8 with 
essentially those terms of reference. 
 
  
Qingdao, People’s Republic of China, was the site 
for PICES IV.  At this meeting, WG 8 consulted 
with its Chinese members on the feasibility of 
using the Three Gorges Project as the focus of the 
workshop.  It was concluded that it could be a very 
lengthy process to get the necessary approvals for 
a workshop with such a focus.  Consequently,  
WG 8 and MEQ accepted an offer from the 
Academia Sinica Institute of Oceanology at 
Qingdao to base the workshop there, with 
Jiaozhou Bay as the study area, and the focus 
would be chemical contaminants.  Jiaozhou Bay 
was attractive scientifically, because the Academia 
Sinica had already accumulated a large body of 
“baseline” data on the Bay, and good laboratory 
facilities were available at the Institute of 
Oceanology.  MEQ fully supported this initiative.  
Throughout the following year, a considerable 
body of data pertaining to Jiaozhou Bay was 
assembled (and in some cases translated) and 
refinements to the operational plan for the 
practical workshop were developed.   
 
The MEQ scientific session at PICES IV on 
“Sources, transport and impact of chemical 
contaminants” provided further background and 
suggestions for approaches to be used at the 
practical workshop.   
 
Since one of the first decisions by MEQ was to 
focus on HABs in addition to chemical pollution, 
MEQ decided that it should not focus exclusively 
on the practical workshop.  The Committee 
recommended that PICES V should include a joint 
session with BIO on HABs as a means to initiate 
activity on this subject.  There was growing 
evidence that the frequency of HABs appeared to 
be increasing worldwide and to be having 
significant ecological (mass die-offs) and 
economic (depressed shellfish harvests) impacts.   
 
During 1996, there was extensive work by WG 8 
on refining plans for the practical workshop, and a 
detailed work plan with cost estimates was 
presented to MEQ, approved, and sent to the 
Science Board at PICES V in Nanaimo, Canada.  
The workshop was envisaged as involving 2-4 
scientists from each member country (now six, 
since Republic of Korea and Russia had joined 
PICES), and a detailed list of samples (sediment, 
water and biota), and analyses (chemical and 
biological) to be carried out was provided.  Since 
Jiaozhou Bay is a fairly heavily industrialised 
system, a “reference” site at nearby Laoshan Bay 
would also be analysed.  The workshop was 
finally scheduled for 2-3 weeks during spring or 
summer of 1997 (June to October).  This was a 
major step forward for MEQ to bring together 
what would be the first collaborative scientific 
effort involving practical field studies by a PICES 
Scientific Committee.  
 
On the advice of our Chinese scientific colleagues, 
two formal requests were made to the appropriate 
Chinese authorities to hold the workshop in 
Qingdao.  However, a formal reply was not 
forthcoming in time to hold the workshop in 1997, 
and it had to be postponed for at least a year.  At 
PICES VI (Pusan, Republic of Korea) it was 
agreed that if no formal approval could be 
obtained by January 1998 from Chinese authorities 
to hold the workshop in summer 1998, an 
alternative study site would be chosen.  The 
general logistic considerations would still apply, 
but we would clearly have to assemble 
“background” information about the chemical, 
physical and biological oceanography of the new 
site.   
 
In addition to dealing with the planning of the 
practical workshop, MEQ sponsored a session on 
“Processes of contaminant cycling” which 
focussed primarily on processes occurring in the 
coastal zone;  many examples of these processes 
were based on data from Masan and Chinhae 
Bays.  MEQ also concluded that a new priority 
area that deserved attention was the issue of 
aquaculture or mariculture.  With the decline in 
wild fish landings and an increasing global 
demand for seafood, the culture of fish and 
shellfish will likely continue to expand and would 
become a larger portion of the economic base of 
the seafood industry worldwide.  Associated with 
this growth are increasing concerns about 
deleterious ecological effects from increased 
eutrophication and habitat degradation, about 
antibiotics as a potential chemical pollutants, and 
about escaped cultured (often “exotic”) species.  
 
In early 1998, a reply was received from the 
Chinese authorities stating that it would not be 
possible to host the practical workshop at 
 
  
Qingdao.  In light of this decision, and given the 
amount of work that had gone into planning the 
workshop, much of the discussion at PICES VII 
(Fairbanks, U.S.A.) centred on the issue of finding 
an alternative study area for the workshop.  
Vancouver Harbour, British Columbia, Canada, 
was chosen.  There were a number of practical 
reasons for the choice, such as the availability of 
laboratory facilities at the West Vancouver 
Laboratory of Canada’s Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans, the availability of appropriate 
“background” information, and other logistical 
considerations, which would allow the workshop 
to proceed without undue delay.  This proposal 
was approved by both MEQ and the Governing 
Council, and WG 8 revised its work plans 
accordingly. 
 
The focus of the MEQ sessions at PICES VII was 
on “Contaminants in high trophic level biota -- 
linkages between individual and population 
responses” (jointly sponsored with BIO) and 
“Science and technology for environmentally 
sustainable mariculture”.  This second session 
indicated a shift in emphasis away from chemical 
contaminant issues and towards the more 
biological aspects of marine environmental 
quality.   The recognition of HABs as an area 
needing additional attention had matured with the 
establishment of specific national research 
initiatives (e.g., US ECOHAB), as well as 
internationally through GEOHAB.  These 
programs were providing support to a number of 
scientists, which increased the likelihood that they 
could participate in a PICES-directed effort that 
would likely significantly improve understanding 
of HAB events and their ecological impacts.  
 
1999 was a special year in the history of MEQ, 
because the practical workshop was held in the 
spring at Vancouver.  A full report of the 
workshop and the data collected are available as 
PICES Scientific Report No. 16.  Briefly, 24 
scientists from all PICES member countries 
participated making a range of measurements 
including chemical, biochemical, pathological, 
physiological, anatomical and ecological analyses 
in Vancouver Harbour over a period of about two 
weeks.  Although the raw data are in the PICES 
Scientific Report, a more valuable product, in the 
sense of highlighting internationally PICES’ (and 
MEQ’s) environmental studies, is the selection of 
refereed papers that will appear as a special issue 
of Marine Environmental Research.  (At the time 
of writing, these are being refereed.)   
 
At PICES VIII (Vladivostok, Russia), two sessions 
were organized by MEQ, one comprising 12 
papers on “Ecological impacts of oil spills” (which 
attracted overflow attendance) and a second 
(jointly with BIO) on “Coastal eutrophication, 
phytoplankton dynamics and harmful algal 
blooms”.  Following these meetings, and 
discussions within the Committee, MEQ decided 
to recommend the formation of a Working Group 
on “Ecology of hamful algal blooms in the North 
Pacific” (WG 15);  this was approved by the 
Governing Council. 
 
At PICES IX (Hakodate, Japan), MEQ held topic 
sessions on “Science and technology for 
environmentally sustainable mariculture:  impacts 
and mitigation in coastal areas” and on 
“Enviromental assessment of Vancouver Harbour:  
results of an international workshop”.  The quality 
of the results presented at the last session 
encouraged planning for a peer-reviewed 
publication mentioned above. 
 
With the completion of the practical workshop, 
MEQ turned its attention to the implementation of 
its Strategic Plan.  This identifies several main 
issues for the next few years:   
• coastal pollution/eutrophication and 
phytoplankton dynamics;  
• ecological impact of oil and other chemical 
spills;  
• science and technology for mariculture;  
• impacts of climate change on coastal systems;  
• biological and physical transport of 
anthropogenic substances in the North Pacific;  
• diseases and their relationship to pollution.   
MEQ also recognizes the need to pursue 
opportunities to work within a broader 
international framework, e.g., through GOOS, 
ICES, AMAP, GIWA or a combination of groups.  
 
A broad retrospective view 
 
The foregoing has summarized in some detail 
MEQ activities over the last decade or so, and it is 
 
  
worth stepping back from this and considering the 
general evolution of the MEQ programme.  
PICES’ original remit to MEQ was essentially to 
harmonize approaches to the assessment of 
pollution by developing a “...common assessment 
methodology...”.  It is worth asking if MEQ has 
reached this objective.   
 
As background, we can consider pollution as one 
kind of environmental change, which results from 
a range of “forcing functions”;  some of these are 
natural (such as climate change, perhaps) and 
some are anthropogenic (introduction of 
contaminants, over-fishing, habitat destruction).  
And of course, some of these forcing functions 
interact among themselves.  Their net effects cause 
changes in the structure and/or function of 
ecosystems, and it is these changes which we want 
to record, to relate to causes and, ultimately, to 
manage.  However, at present we are limited in the 
measurements we can make to indicate ecosystem 
changes:  we can routinely measure the 
distribution of chemicals in various ecosystem 
compartments and we can, in a few cases, measure 
some functional or structural changes in specific 
ecosystem compartments.  These are, however, 
only “snapshots” of aspects of ecosystem structure 
and/or function. 
 
Within this generalized conceptual framework, 
MEQ has gone some way to harmonizing its 
approaches to assessing pollution.  Most countries 
rely on similar approaches (specifically, 
contaminant monitoring by analytical chemistry); 
some extend this to biological effects 
measurements, which complement the chemical 
data.  Through sessions at the Annual Meetings, 
MEQ has encouraged discussion of these 
approaches, and most importantly at the 
Vancouver workshop, PICES scientists have been 
able to work together in applying a variety of 
assessment methods and in seeing their value and 
relevance.  This is not to say that all PICES 
countries will adopt methods used at Vancouver, 
but the “hands-on” experience of working 
collaboratively using these techniques must lead 
eventually to a better mutual understanding of 
their value. 
 
In addition to the technical and scientific 
difficulties of harmonizing approaches to 
assessing marine pollution, it is worth noting that 
there are contextual factors of scale, of political 
objectives, and of technical expertise and 
economic capacity which govern the evolution of 
the MEQ programme.  As we have noted above, 
there always has been an element of conflict 
between PICES’ broad --- almost hemispheric --- 
view of the North Pacific, and individual member 
nations’ focus on local or regional pollution issues.  
The difference is one of geographic scale:  the 
North Pacific as a system functions on scales of 
thousands of kilometers, whereas most pollution 
concerns of member nations (and the programmes 
to deal with these concerns) occupy scales of tens 
to hundreds of kilometers.  But this difference in 
geographic scale has implications for the temporal 
scales on which we operate:  changes in ecosystem 
processes in the North Pacific are likely to occur 
(or be detected) over intervals of decades, while 
coastal or regional pollution studies often focus on 
questions (e.g., about regulation of pollutants) 
which may be answered (at least, resource 
managers hope they can be answered) over periods 
of years.  MEQ has always been aware of these 
differences in perspective but national priorities 
and the practicalities of science funding have 
probably led us to emphasize local and regional 
approaches rather than hemispheric ones.  This is 
not to say that MEQ does not recognize the 
importance, of long-range atmospheric transport of 
pollutants from industrialized to less contaminated 
regions (indeed, we have tried to address that issue 
in previous sessions);  rather, our national 
concerns with local or immediate problems have 
often pushed these less urgent issues to the 
background.  Only time will tell whether this has 
been a wise strategy. 
 
“Scale” in the perspective of PICES (as compared 
to that of its members) also provides a context 
within which to compare PICES and ICES.  
PICES structure was modelled largely on ICES, 
but the geographic scale on which the two 
organizations operate are quite different.  
Although Canada and U.S.A. are members of 
ICES, in the context of MEQ, ICES is much more 
of a regional organization (Canada and U.S.A. 
contribute extensively to the “research” aspects of 
MEQ in ICES, but are involved much less in 
regulatory affairs).  But because ICES is largely an 
organization of states in close proximity to each 
 
  
other (around the North Sea and the Baltic) 
pollution concerns or events on scales of tens to 
hundreds of kilometers have international 
implications that are virtually absent from PICES. 
It is therefore not surprising that the ICES 
Advisory Committee on the Marine Environment 
has a supra-national advisory role which seems to 
lead to international co-ordination (within ICES) 
in dealing with some aspects of marine pollution.  
Within PICES, there seems to have been no need 
(so far) for such a PICES-wide group which works 
towards “managing” the North Pacific;  instead, 
member states have often developed bi-lateral 
structures to address local or regional pollution 
issues over scales of tens to hundreds of 
kilometers.  Some examples include the Canada – 
U.S.A. initiatives in the Straits of Georgia, Juan de 
Fuca and Puget Sound;  the Russia - Japan 
initiative on MEQ in the Japan/East Sea (Peter the 
Great Bay) and the Korea - China studies on the 
Gulf of Bo Hai. 
 
Finally, we should note that PICES membership 
reflects a wide diversity of cultural approaches to 
science, and a wide range of technical expertise 
and economic capacity.  This is much less the case 
in ICES, which comprises nations of mainly 
northern European stock with roughly similar 
approaches to science and which are at a generally 
similar level of technological advancement.  
Although these considerations should not be 
important in a purely scientific context, the fact 
remains that different nations have different 
outlooks, priorities, and ways of doing things, 
which inevitably affect the extent to which even 
general objectives can be reached. 
 
Future directions for MEQ 
 
Although this will be the subject of another paper, 
it is unavoidable that after reflecting on the past 
decade we should think a bit about the future. 
Some trends and remaining issues are obvious.  
 
“Assessment of pollution...” is a moving target.  A 
decade ago we would have assessed pollution  
 
largely in terms of the distribution of “classical” 
contaminants such as POPs, heavy metals and 
radionuclides (and indeed, those topics were the 
focus of the background papers prepared for 
PICES II in which member countries assessed 
the status of their MEQ programmes);  now, we 
would probably want to consider HABs, 
eutrophication, introduction of exotic species, 
habitat destruction, etc., in an assessment of 
pollution. The obvious response to this has been 
the formation of WG 15 dealing with the impacts 
of HABs and related topics.  This reflects the 
general recognition that “pollution” encompasses 
more than just the distribution and effects of 
chemicals, and it opens up a new set of problems 
in “assessing” pollution.   These point to the need 
to develop better indicators of ecosystem change, 
and while this is not a problem that is unique to 
PICES, probably the best strategy to deal with it is 
for PICES to maintain close working relationships 
with other agencies or individuals working in the 
area.  
 
A second major area for future MEQ activities is 
in the context of even larger scale global or 
hemispheric programmes.  Given what we know 
about the integration of physical processes on a 
global scale (e. g., the distant effects of ENSO), it 
would make strategic sense over the next decade 
or so for MEQ to consider issues such as the trans-
Pacific transport of pollutants within the context of 
structures such as GOOS, which is intended to 
provide a framework for even larger-scale 
collaboration than is possible within PICES. 
 
During the last decade, MEQ has developed into a 
cohesive group, which has collaborated 
successfully, on problems of common interest, and 
a measure of its success is the output of the 
practical workshop, scheduled to be published in a 
refereed international journal.  MEQ has now 
decided to expand its interests, and while this 
expansion will undoubtedly raise new (and 
difficult) scientific questions, the group should be 
well placed to identify and to address them.

Introduction 
 
A little over a decade ago, Waldichuk (1990) 
reviewed the state of industrial and domestic 
pollution of the North Pacific and concluded that 
interfaces (e.g., air-water, water-sediment, 
shorelines) and coastal areas, especially those 
surrounded by dense population and industry, 
were most at risk.  His list of critical contaminants 
– hydrocarbons and polynuclear aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine compounds, 
metals, radionuclides, and persistent solids – 
remains valid today.  
 
Although toxic effects of contaminants have long 
been known, it was only during the past decade 
that we have learned the myriad ways trace 
quantities of chemicals can produce subtle 
disruption to endocrine systems every bit as 
threatening to aquatic animals as outright toxicity 
(Colborn et al. 1996).  For this reason, 
Waldichuk’s priority contaminant issues – 
halogenated hydrocarbons and sewage – were well 
chosen.  During the past decade, expanded 
industry and increasing coastal populations have 
escalated the pressure on productive marginal seas 
(Fig. 1) – the very regions that are being counted 
on to provide even more protein for future 
populations.  For example, in 1998 an estimated 
two-thirds of the world’s population (3.6 billion) 
lived within 60 km of the coast (UNESCO 1998), 
and total population is increasing at about 77 
million per year (U.S. Census Bureau 2002).  In 
U.S.A., over 50% of the population lives in the 
narrow coastal fringe and that population is 
increasing by about 1.3 million per year (Culliton 
1998). 
 
In addition to chemical contaminants, these coastal 
seas are under onslaught from enhanced nutrient 
and sediment loadings, climate change, over-
fishing, habitat disruption and the introduction of 
exotic species.  For the most intensively utilized 
enclosed seas of East Asia, e.g., the South China 
Sea, projections are indeed grim (Morton and 
Blackmore 2001). 
 
Here we discuss the major threats human activities 
present to North Pacific marine ecosystems with 
chemical contamination as a central theme.  We 
discuss briefly concurrent issues of climate 
change, disruption of CNP (carbon, nitrogen, 
phosphorus) cycles, and predation, because these 
factors confound chemical contamination, both in 
terms of its effects and in the way chemical 
contaminants pass through marine systems.  It is 
not our intention to present a comprehensive 
review of the literature.  Rather, we highlight the 
contaminant issues facing the North Pacific, 
drawing suitable examples for the most part from 
literature of the last decade.  Finally, we propose 
the sorts of observations and research required to 
mobilize society to reverse its present course, 
which if unchecked, will lead to the yet further 
widespread destruction of coastal ecosystems.

Pressures on North Pacific marine ecosystems 
 
Climate change 
 
Climate change poses several kinds of risk, 
including temperature rise through greenhouse gas 
forcing (IPCC 1995), alteration of the hydrological 
cycle (Dynesius and Nilsson 1994; Vörösmarty et 
al. 2001), increased exposure from ultraviolet 
radiation (Weatherhead and Morseth, 1998) and 
sea-level rise (Ledley et al. 1999). These sorts of 
change, which imply significant effects on aquatic 
systems and humans, are often difficult to detect at 
their early stages due to natural variability at time 
scales from years to decades to centuries (see, for 
example, Francis et al. 1998;  Hare and Mantua 
2000).   
 
Air temperature in the northern hemisphere has 
been anomalously high during the past decade 
(IPCC 1995), as have been the heat content and 
surface temperature of the North Pacific Ocean 
(Levitus et al. 2000;  Ma et al. 1995).  However, 
on both sides of the North Pacific, temperature 
anomalies are associated with El Niño – for 
example, sea-surface temperatures in northeastern 
China are lower during summer in El Niño years 
(Li 1989), whereas those in the eastern North 
Pacific are higher (Whitney and Freeland 1999).  
Similarly, the intrusion of Oyashio waters usually 
causes abnormally cold summers in the northern 
areas of Honshu, Japan, which, together with the 
import of nutrients, influences coastal fisheries 
(Sawada and Hayakawa 1997;  Sekine 1996);  and 
atmospheric warming and cooling drive short-term 
variation in sea surface temperature in the 
Japan/East Sea (Chu et al. 1998).  Sub-decadal 
signals in ocean temperature like these complicate 
the determination of any temperature trend 
associated with greenhouse gas (GHG) warming.  
Ocean warming and ocean-atmosphere disturbance 
can cause the large-scale re-distribution of species 
(see, for example, Di Tullio and Laws 1991;  Karl 
et al. 1995;  Saar 2000;  Schell 2000).  
Anadromous fish may be exceptionally vulnerable 
to temperature change because threshold 
temperatures in rivers, once passed, may eliminate 
spawning.  Model projections warn that 
temperature may increase sufficiently in the Fraser 
River within a few decades to put at risk the 
world’s largest wild salmon runs (Morrison et al. 
2002).   
Sea level rise (SLR) threatens all coastlines, but 
especially those with low gradient, poorly-bonded 
soils, high human population and land subsidence 
– conditions that frequently converge in deltas.  
Records suggest that a SLR of perhaps 10-30 cm 
has occurred during the past century (Anonymous 
2000;  Wang 1998) and a further 10-25 cm SLR is 
projected to occur over the next century.  Due to 
overpumping of groundwater and overloading by 
construction on deltas, the rate of relative SLR is 
even higher in critical locations like Tianjin on the 
old Yellow River Delta (24.5-50.0 mm/yr), the 
modern river delta (4.5-5.5 mm/yr), and the 
Shanghai area of the Yangtze River mouth (6.5-
11.0 mm/yr) (Wang 1996).  Assuming a SLR of 
30-100 cm in the next century and accounting for 
land subsidence, Liu et al. (1999) estimate that the 
coastline of the Bohai Sea will retreat by 50-70 km 
over the next century, involving a marine 
transgression of 10,000-11,500 km
2
, and perhaps 
as much as 16,000 km
2
 if storm surges are taken 
into account (Zhang and Wang 1994). 
 
The “aliasing” inherent in natural variability at 
decadal or longer time scales presents what is 
probably the greatest challenge to detecting recent 
trends in the ocean produced by human activities.  
During the last decade, regime shifts have been 
recognized as a pervasive manifestation of 
relatively abrupt physical and biological 
alterations to the upper Pacific Ocean (Hare and 
Mantua 2000).  For example, a restructuring of the 
mixed-layer depth in the mid to late 1970s  
(Fig. 2a) (Freeland et al. 1997) must have been 
accompanied by altered nutrient cycling with 
‘bottom-up’ consequences for the ecosystem.  At 
about the same time, it appears that anadromous 
fish recruitment was affected, probably due to 
changes in marine survival (Fig. 2b) (Welch et al. 
2000).  It has recently been recognized that, 
starting with nutrient supply, a large-scale 
ecosystem restructuring has occurred in the Bering 
Sea.  The associated change in organic carbon 
cycling was recorded by Bowhead whale baleen 
(Fig. 3) (Schell 2000) and other wide-spread 
systematic changes in food-web dynamics (Hunt et 
al. 1999;  Niebauer 1998;  Rugh et al. 1999;  Saar

2000;  Stabeno and Overland 2001;  Stockwell et 
al. 2000).  The wide variety of physical and 
biological pathways implicated in regime shifts 
(Hare and Mantua 2000), has significant 
consequences for the transport and processing of 
contaminants both regionally and locally – 
especially for contaminants that concentrate and 
biomagnify in food-webs (e.g., Hg and 
organochlorines). 
 
Predation by humans 
 
Over the past decade there has been growing 
concern that ocean trophic structure can be 
affected by commercial fisheries.  Selective 
extraction of fish – referred to by Pauly et al. 
(1998; 2001) as ‘fishing down the food web’ – 
may lead to a global-scale reduction in marine 
trophic levels (Fig. 4a), which exerts its influence 
from the top down (Parsons 1996) (Fig. 4b). 
 
 
 
Fig. 4 a) The change in mean trophic level for 
the Canadian west coast between 1873 and 1996 
(Pauly et. al. 2001).  b) A schemetic showing how 
trophic structure in aquatic systems can be altered 
from the bottom-up or from the top-down (Parsons 
1992). 
 
  
All highly-prized species are vulnerable to this 
impact, but with increasing fishing pressure and 
dwindling stocks, less desirable species or smaller 
individuals become targets of commercial and 
private fisheries, and often, governments prolong 
un-economical practises which eventually lead to 
the demise of the resource (Ludwig et al. 1993). 
Destructive fishing methods (blast and cyanide 
fishing) widely practiced in Asian shelf waters 
(Morton and Blackmore 2001) exacerbate the 
problem of over-fishing and undermine the 
potential for recovery.  Driftnet and other “ghost” 
fisheries have well-known, but perhaps poorly-
quantified, effects on non-target species (Dayton 
1998).  
 
It is clear that fishing and contamination both 
provide stresses to coastal ecosystems, but the 
alteration of trophic structure – either from the top 
down by fishing, or the bottom up by climate 
change and coastal eutrophication – has special 
significance to chemicals that biomagnify (e.g., 
Hg and organochlorines). 
 
Exotic species 
 
Intentional and unintentional release of non-native 
species plague coastal seas and freshwater 
systems.  The partial list of introduced species for 
the Northeast Pacific (Table 1) illustrates the 
extent of the impact and demonstrates that, as in 
the case of commercial harvesting, aquatic trophic 
structure can be altered at almost every level. 
 
Harmful algal blooms 
 
Harmful algal blooms (HABs) pre-date human 
encroachment on marine systems.  However, there 
is concern that the incidence and severity of HABs 
have increased due to human activities such as 
coastal eutrophication and contaminant loading, 
and global change such as warming (see for 
example Goldberg 1995;  Morton and Blackmore 
2001;  Waldichuk 1990).  HABs can present a risk 
to fish (e.g., Heterosigma Khan et al. 1997) or to 
humans (e.g., PSP, amnesic poisoning:  Horner 
and Postel 1993;  IOC 2000) and no corner of the 
North Pacific may be considered immune from 
them (Horner et al. 1997;  Konovalova 1993; 
Morton and Blackmore 2001).  Although HAB-
forming algae are widespread, they may in some 
circumstances be classified as “exotics” since 
ship’s ballast water can transport them 
(Hallegraeff 1998).  In the context of 
contaminants, HABs can be considered either as a 
point of leverage where anthropogenic nutrient 
and trace metal loadings promote a process that 
produces toxic compounds, or as exotic species 
with the potential to alter trophic structure either 
by direct insertion into the food web or by removal 
of a trophic component through selective toxicity. 
 
Sediment discharge into coastal water 
 
Some 1 billion tonnes of fine sediments are 
supplied annually to the eastern coastline of China, 
brought mainly by the Yellow River from the 
Loess Plateau as a result of soil erosion from 
human activities since historical times (Wang 
1996).  Asian rivers have especially been affected 
by human activities, modern sediment loads being 
perhaps five times those prior to the development 
of agriculture (GESAMP 1993).  The consequence 
of these higher loadings is that affected coastal 
areas may become overly productive and either 
hypoxic or anoxic (Goolsby 2000).  Enhanced 
sediment fluxes also provide the means to 
scavenge and bury particle-reactive contaminants 
in deltas and on the adjacent continental shelves. 
Recent damming of the Yellow River, however, 
appears to have reversed the historical trend (Yang 
et al. 1998), with sediment supply now dwindling.  
The withdrawal of sediment loading alters the 
balance between sediment supply, wave re-
suspension, and coastal transport, with the 
potential consequence of accelerating the loss of 
deltaic areas already threatened by sea-level rise.  
 
Chemical contamination 
 
Hydrocarbons and polynuclear aromatic 
hydrocarbons 
 
Combustion and petrogenesis are the two major 
sources of hydrocarbons in the environment, and 
both can occur either naturally or through human 
activities (Yunker et al. 2000).  There have not 
been any major oil spills in the North Pacific since 
the Exxon Valdez incident in 1989, but the effects 
of that spill were devastating.  Marine organisms

from barnacles to seals were killed, including 
about 250,000 sea birds (Piatt and Anderson 
1996).  Long-term effects include depressed 
populations and the lowered reproductive success 
of most of the oiled species, although in many 
cases it is difficult to distinguish between effects 
of the oil spill and those of decadal-scale 
environmental change.  For example, the 
unusually low flow of the Alaskan Coastal Current 
in the years following the spill may have 
contributed partly to the low murre population 
during that time (Piatt and Anderson 1996), and 
the number of seals killed by the spill is disputed, 
due to limited observations over their natural 
range (Hoover-Miller et al. 2001).  A definite link 
has been made in one case:  Brown pelicans that 
had been oiled, cleaned and released were marked 
and compared over the course of several years 
with marked control birds (Anderson et al. 1996). 
The oiled birds disappeared much more quickly 
 
  
than control birds, and they failed to reproduce, 
whereas the controls continued to behave 
normally.  
 
Lowered reproductive success of animals that have 
been exposed to oil is not surprising, given that 
PAHs are known endocrine-disrupters (Carls et al. 
1999).  Oil from the Exxon Valdez spill remained 
under the stones and mussel beds of nearby 
beaches five years after the spill (Spies et al. 
1996), although the sediments of the intertidal 
zone had lost their toxicity to oysters and 
amphipods after two years (Wolfe et al. 1996).   
 
Increasing pressure to find oil on continental 
shelves will probably increase the risk of 
hydrocarbon pollution to the North Pacific: 
Canada (British Columbia), the U.S.A. 
(California), Republic of Korea and Japan have all 
indicated that they intend either to begin or to 
expand exploration on the continental shelves of 
the Pacific, and drilling already occurs off Alaska 
and California and in the East China Sea.  The 
environmental risks posed by offshore exploration 
and production are well known.  They include the 
loss of hydrocarbons to the environment, 
smothering of benthos, sediment anoxia, 
destruction of benthic habitat, and the use of 
explosives (Patin 1999).  Oil released from 
offshore operations may contain other harmful 
components like the endocrine-disrupting 
alkylphenols (Lye 2000).  The generally high 
seismic activity of the Pacific Rim may further 
enhance the risk of spills (for comments regarding 
the South China Sea, see Zhang 1994).   
 
Despite the high media and public interest in 
catastrophic oil releases, the predominant sources 
of hydrocarbons to coastal seas are either land 
based (via rivers) or derive from intense shipping 
activity as exemplified by studies in Peter the 
Great Bay (Nemirovskaya 1999), around 
Vladivostock on the Russian coast of the Sea of 
Japan (Tkalin 1992), and the Georgia Basin of the 
British Columbia coast (Yunker et al. 2000). 
 
Halogenated hydrocarbons 
 
Organochlorine compounds (OCs) have been 
released to the global environment in a number of 
ways, including industrial applications (e.g., PCB), 
incineration (e.g., dioxins, furans), chlorination in 
pulp mills (dioxins, furans, PCBs) and pesticide 
application (e.g., DDT, HCH, chlordane).  As a 
result, for any coastal sea in the North Pacific 
there will be a long-range, global source 
component for these compounds which is then 
augmented to a lesser or greater degree by local 
sources, either through the air or through runoff. 
Waldichuk (1990) noted that winds in the North 
Pacific would tend to transport volatile 
contaminants from Asia eastward to North 
America.  Recent work has clarified this general 
transport scheme and provided further evidence of 
its efficacy in spreading volatile and particulate 
contaminants from Asia across the ocean to North 
America (Fig. 5) (Bailey et al. 2000;  Jaffe et al. 
1997;  Li et al. 2002;  Macdonald et al. 2000a; 
Wilkening et al. 2000).  
 
Despite bans or restrictions during the 1970s and 
1980s in most of the countries surrounding the 
North Pacific, PCBs, DDT and other 
organochlorine pesticides remain in soils and in 
aquatic environments.  In the latter, they 
biomagnify to especially high concentrations in 
apex feeders such as marine mammals (Muir et al. 
1999;  Ross et al. 2000).  In the early years 
following bans, the concentrations of PCBs and 
DDT decreased rapidly in the Pacific Ocean 
(Waldichuk 1990), but that seems no longer to be 
universally true.  For example, between the late 
1970s and early 1990s, there has been no trend in 
PCB concentration in particulate and dissolved 
fractions of San Francisco estuary water (Jarman 
et al. 1996).  According to Iwata et al. (1994a), the 
concentrations of DDT, PCBs, HCH and HCB 
(hexachlorobenzene) have not been decreasing 
rapidly in the Bering Sea, because atmospheric 
deposition exceeds the sedimentation rate.  
However, decreased atmospheric concentrations of 
HCH following the elimination of technical HCH 
use in China and India during the 1980s and 1990s 
(Li et al. 2002), have reversed the net exchange of 
α-HCH, such that the Bering Sea has now become 
a source to the atmosphere (Jantunen and 
Bidleman 1995).  The long-range atmospheric 
and/or oceanic transport of HCHs together with 
large changes in emissions have made them (i.e.  
α-, γ-, β-HCH) useful tracers of transport 
processes in the Bering Sea and into the Arctic 
Ocean (Li et al. 2002;  Rice and Shigaev 1997). 
 
Fig. 5 Trans-Pacific atmospheric transport from Asia to North America as shown by a) dust from the 
Gobi Desert (Wilkening et al. 2000), and b) back trajectories from an air monitoring site in Canada’s 
Yukon Territory (Bailey 2000 # 179). 
The Bering Sea illustrates that long-range 
transport together with physical and biological 
processes (Chernyak et al. 1996;  Hoekstra et al. 
2002;  Sokolova et al. 1995) can produce 
significant concentrations of pesticides in apex 
feeders far from local sources.  Furthermore, the 
animals themselves may then become significant 
vectors of OC contaminant transport as 
exemplified by anadromous fish in Alaska (Ewald 
et al. 1998). 
 
Local sources of OCs support high sediment 
concentrations in some locations.  For example, 
DDT and HCH in the sediments of Peter the Great 
Bay probably reflect a continuing local source of 
those contaminants near Vladivostok (Tkalin et al. 
2000), and high concentrations of DDT, DDD and 
DDE in the sediments of Lianyungang Harbour in 
China suggests continuing use of these compounds 
in local agriculture (Zhu and Tkalin 1994).  There 
appear to be a number of local sources of DDT in 
some areas of the South China Sea (probably local 
industry or illegal dumping), as evidenced by 
variability in the ratio of DDE/ ΣDDT
 
in the 
sediments (Morton and Blackmore 2001).  
 
Marine mammals are particularly vulnerable to 
OCs due to biomagnification.  Whales (Aono et al. 
1997;  Hayteas and Duffield 2000;  Jarman et al. 
1996;  Ross et al. 2000), dolphins (Jarman et al. 
1996;  Minh et al. 2000), porpoises (Jarman et al. 
1996;  Minh et al. 2000;  Zhou et al. 1993), seals 
(Nakata et al. 1998), sea lions (Lee et al. 1996) 
and humans (Morton and Blackmore 2001) are all 
contaminated.  The degree of contamination and 
specific pollutants in each case depend on 
geographic location and trophic level.   
 
 
  
Temporal trends in the concentration of 
organochlorines in marine mammals also vary 
among species and with organochlorine type.  In 
Minke whales, the concentration of DDT is 
decreasing, while PCB concentration is not, 
suggesting a continuing source of them to the 
North Pacific (Aono et al. 1997).  The 
concentration of PCBs and other organochlorines 
in Killer whales varies with age and gender (Ross 
et al. 2000) and, off the coast of British Columbia 
and California, is generally higher than in dolphins 
and porpoises (Jarman et al. 1996).  British 
Columbia Killer whales (and seals) exhibit high 
concentrations of dioxins and furans (Jarman et al. 
1996;  Ross et al. 2000), but for these compounds, 
local sources (pulp mills) have clearly made a 
substantial contribution (Bright et al. 1999; 
Macdonald et al. 1992).  Elimination of chlorine 
bleach and pentachlorophenol- (PCP) 
contaminated feed stock after 1987 has led to 
substantial declines in PCDD/F concentrations in 
sediments and crabs (Yunker and Cretney 1996) 
and in seals (Fig. 6).  Source controls, which have 
all but eliminated the pulp mill PCDD/Fs, 
however, have made no inroads on the PCBs 
which derive predominantly from other sources – 
local, regional and global (Addison and Ross 
2000).   
Juvenile Pacific salmon accumulate 
immunosuppressive OCs as they develop in 
estuaries (Arkoosh et al. 1998), which may make 
them especially susceptible to the pathogens  
common in these environments. Sea birds are 
similarly affected.  At Port Alberni, on the west 
coast of Vancouver Island, Canada, fish-eating 
grebe and seaduck were heavily contaminated with 
dioxins and furans from a nearby pulp mill (Elliott 
and Martin 1998).  Those compounds also present 
the main pollution threat to Marbled murrelets 
along the British Columbia, Washington and 
California coasts.  Eggshell thinning due to 
organochlorine pesticides is no longer considered 
a threat to seabirds off California (Pyle et al. 
1999), and in herons the threat is mainly restricted 
to those that live near agricultural areas (Speich et 
al. 1992).  Amphipods, sea urchins, 
bioluminescent microbes (Long 2000) and squid 
(Shibata, pers. comm.;  Sato et al. 2000) also 
accumulate OCs although toxic effects are as yet 
unclear.  Oysters off Taiwan are so contaminated 
with DDT that there is a high lifetime risk of 
cancer for people who consume them (Han et al. 
2000).  The concentrations of HCH and PCB  
(Cl
5-9
) in squid livers correlate well with those in 
nearby sea water, lagged by 1-2 years, suggesting 
a reasonably dynamic equilibrium rather than 
progressive accumulation with age (Sato et al. 
2000). 
 
Metals 
The waters off Hong Kong (Parsons 1998) and the 
sediments of the Japan/East Sea (Shulkin and 
Bogdanova 1998;  Vaschenko et al. 1999), the 
South China Sea (Morton and Blackmore 2001)  
 
 
 
Fig. 6 An example of trend data from the west coast of North America showing PCB production 
(solid blue line) and TCDF discharge from Fraser basin pulp mills (solid red line) compared with residues 
in Harbour seals (Addison and Ross 2000) and in Harbour seal pups (blue circles, Calambokidis et al. 
1991).
and the Yellow Sea (Shao et al. 1995;  Yu et al. 
1996;  Zhang et al. 1998) are highly contaminated 
with metals, especially near farmed shrimp ponds 
(Cui et al. 1997), and the problem is increasing.  
Long-range transport of some metals (Pb:  Lin et 
al. 2000;  Cd:  Patterson and Duce 1991) from 
Asia has been observed in the North Pacific, and 
some particulate trace metals cross the shelf from 
the East China Sea to enrich the intermediate layer 
of the Kuroshio Current (Hung and Chan 1998).  
But the main effect of metal pollution remains 
close to the source.  A pronounced increase in 
anthropogenic lead loading to the Yangtze River 
during the 1980s and 1990s has been inferred from 
sediment cores collected from the East China Sea 
continental shelf (Huh and Chen 1999).  These 
trends probably reflect the rapid economic growth 
and the lack of waste control in China.  
Contaminant metals in the marginal seas derive 
mainly from untreated sewage and industrial 
wastes (Parsons 1998;  Shao et al. 1995) that 
either washes off the shore or enters rivers.  
Resuspension (Fichet et al. 1998) and deposition 
of dissolved and particulate matter by rain (Gao et 
al. 1997;  Zhang et al. 1999;  Zhang et al. 1992) 
are also major sources of metal pollution in Asian 
marginal seas. 
 
As a consequence of the sediment and water 
pollution, much of the marine life in Asian 
marginal seas exhibits metal contamination.  In 
Zhifu Bay in the Yellow Sea, for example, 
increased benthic pollution between 1986 and 
1998 caused a change in dominant species from 
non-pollutant-resistant echinoderms to pollutant-
resistant polychaetes (Zhang et al. 1998).  Oysters 
(Cheung and Wong 1992;  Han et al. 2000), 
scallops (Vaschenko et al. 1999) and fish (Parsons 
1998) are also contaminated.  
 
The shelves of the northwest coast of North 
America appear to be almost pristine compared to 
Asia (Macdonald and Pedersen 1991;  Naidu et al. 
1997).  However, metal contamination can 
certainly be identified in enclosed embayments 
(Flegal and Sañudo-Wilhelmy 1993;  Macdonald 
and Crecelius 1994;  Paulson et al. 1993;  Sañudo-
Wilhelmy and Flegal 1992).  
 
Of the metals, mercury and tributyltin (TBT) cause 
particular concern due to their toxicity and 
endocrine-disrupting characteristics.  Furthermore, 
mercury biomagnifies by factors of 1000-3000 
from particulate organic matter to apex predators 
(Atwell et al. 1998), and its rate of cycling in the 
global environment appears to have increased by 
perhaps a factor of three since pre-industrial times 
(Mason et al. 1994).  Mercury, therefore, provides 
a problem not unlike that of the OCs, in that the 
upper ocean has globally-enhanced mercury 
concentrations (Mason et al. 1994), which are then 
augmented locally (usually from land).  
Furthermore, enhanced global cycling together 
with biomagnification can create biotransport 
vectors (Zhang et al. 2001) as was shown for OCs 
(Ewald et al. 1998).  
 
Symptoms of Minimata disease were detected 
during the 1980s in fishermen who relied heavily 
on fish from the Songhua River in China, a river 
that had been polluted by mercury in the 1970s 
(Gao et al. 1991).  The intake of methyl mercury 
was estimated to be between 0.17-0.34 mg/day 
and the average mercury contents of the hair and 
urine were 13-58 and 10-33 times higher than 
normal, respectively.  In the Japan/East Sea the 
concentration of mercury is increasing in water, 
sediments and the tissues of molluscs (Luchsheva 
1995).  In the most affected area in Alekseev Bight 
in Peter the Great Bay, the concentration of 
mercury in molluscs exceeds pollution guidelines. 
Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphins off the coast of 
Hong Kong also contain dangerous levels of 
mercury (Parsons 1998).  On the eastern side of 
the Pacific, problems arose during the 1960s, but 
the sources of mercury have since been controlled 
(Waldichuk 1990).  This is reflected in the 
sedimentary records of the Strait of Georgia and 
Puget Sound, Washington (Macdonald and 
Crecelius 1994).  The common sources of mercury 
(e.g., dental and medical offices, light industry 
(Nriagu and Pacyna 1988)) imply that municipal 
outfalls are probably important local conduits for 
this metal to coastal environments.  
 
Tributyltin is prevalent in the sediments, water and 
biota in the North Pacific and the South China Sea 
(Iwata et al. 1994b;  Morton and Blackmore 2001) 
but it is the manifestation of imposex in shellfish 
at extraordinarily low TBT concentrations  
(< 0.5 ng l
-1
, Ronis and Mason 1996) that has 
engendered the greatest concern in the literature. 
 
  
In 1989, the use of TBT to prevent biofouling on 
hulls was restricted to ships > 25 m long;  TBT is 
now found mainly in heavily-used ports, 
especially those with dry-dock facilities (Evans et 
al. 1995;  Morton and Blackmore 2001).  In two 
such areas - the Strait of Malacca and Tokyo Bay - 
the concentration of TBT in seawater is high 
enough to cause imposex in gastropods and 
damage to other marine life (Hashimoto et al. 
1998).  In areas with less ship traffic, TBT 
restrictions have been successful at reducing 
imposex in gastropods and shell-thickening in 
oysters (Evans et al. 1995).   
 
In British Columbia’s coastal waters there is some 
evidence that the gastropod population in the Strait 
of Georgia is recovering since TBT restrictions 
have been implemented (Tester et al. 1996).  
However, imposex in female whelks continues 
near Victoria, and in Vancouver Harbour there are 
still no animals to study.  Although TBT is highly 
toxic, its use persists on large ships (and probably 
illegally on many smaller boats) because of its 
effectiveness and the tremendous saving in fuel 
that it allows (Morton and Blackmore 2001).  A 
related compound, triphenyltin (TPT), has been 
detected in water and mussels from Osaka Bay, 
but levels appear to have declined between 1989 
and 1996 (Harino et al. 1999). 
 
Other bioactive metals may threaten marine life 
(Bruland et al. 1991;  Waldichuk 1990). 
Manganese and copper have been reported in 
snow geese off British Columbia and California 
(Hui et al. 1998).  Manganese can cause 
neurological damage in seabirds and copper can 
cause anemia (Hui et al. 1998).  The birds that 
feed off agricultural land in California are more 
contaminated than those that feed on British 
Columbia’s pastures and marshes, probably 
because agricultural fungicides and fertilizers 
contain both metals (Hui et al. 1998).  Edible 
seaweed in British Columbia and Japan is 
contaminated with arsenic, but the human health 
risk is unknown, because its bioavailability in 
seaweed has not been determined (van Netten et 
al. 2000).  
 
The Bering Sea is less polluted with metals than 
are Asian marginal seas and the coast of North 
America.  In contrast to the Yangtze River that 
feeds the East China Sea, the Anadyr River, the 
second-largest to flow into the Bering Sea, is not 
measurably contaminated with either metals or 
radionuclides (Alexander and Windom 1999).  
The concentrations of zinc, copper, cadmium and 
lead in Bering Sea fish (pollock, hake, whiting and 
mackerel) are low (Polak-Juszczak and Domagala 
1993) as are the concentrations of such metals in 
sediments (Naidu et al. 1997).  
 
Placer mining, tailings disposal and the collection 
of polymetallic nodules from the deep sea are 
likely to be sources of contaminant metals into the 
future.  Placer gold mining in Norton Sound in the 
northeastern Bering Sea from 1986 to 1990 
appears not to have affected the concentration of 
metals in King crabs because they were only in the 
area in the winter, which was the off-season for 
mining (Jewett 1999;  Jewett et al. 1999;  Jewett 
and Naidu 2000).   
 
The Rudnayu River discharges mining wastes into 
the Japan/East Sea from Russia contaminating 
coastal sediments with lead, cadmium, copper and 
zinc in a 25 km long plume southward of the 
river’s estuary (Shulkin and Bogdanova 1998).  
Disposal of metal-rich mine tailings in coastal 
fiords of British Columbia creates a combined 
impact from smothering and metal contamination, 
which may persist for decades due to instability of 
sub-sea tailings deposits (Burd et al. 2000). 
 
The technology for mining polymetallic nodules 
and crusts in the Pacific Ocean has advanced 
sufficiently to allow serious prospecting for large-
scale mining by Japan (Nakao 1995) and China 
(Xu et al. 1994).  Deep-sea mining of nodules 
would bring with it the risks of physical disruption 
to benthic habitats, spills of toxic leaching fluids 
and smothering by sediment plumes and 
degradable organic matter (Ahnert and Borowski 
2000).  
 
Radionuclides 
 
Waldichuk’s (1990) conclusion, that artificial 
radionuclides from atmospheric weapons testing 
posed little risk to marine environments in 1990, 
can be repeated with the comment that radio-decay 
will have further reduced inventories of the 
predominant radioactive contributors (
137
Cs, 
90
Sr – 
 
  
t
½
 ~30 years) by 20% over the past decade.  
However, in the early 1990s, it was revealed that 
the former Soviet Union had disposed of liquid 
and solid radioactive wastes at a number of sites 
including the Northwest Pacific (Yablokov 2001). 
Extensive studies during the 1990s concluded that, 
despite the size of the releases both in the Arctic 
and North Pacific, there was actually little 
radiological risk (Layton et al. 1997).  For 
example, Hong et al. (1999b) reported that the 
concentration of 
239, 240
Pu in zooplankton in the 
Bering Sea was similar to that of zooplankton 
found in the rest of the Pacific Ocean and 
represented long-range transport of radionuclides.  
In the Sea of Okhotsk, as of 1995, most of the 
90
Sr, 
137
Cs and 
138,139,140
Pu was still in the water column 
(Pettersson et al. 2000).  The concentration of 
these elements was consistent with previous 
measurements, but the total inventory in water and 
sediments represented more radionuclides than 
expected from global fallout (Pettersson et al. 
2000).  Measurements of 
239, 240
Pu and 
137
Cs in 
fish, shellfish, cephalopods, crustaceans and algae 
in the Japan/East Sea and off the Pacific coast of 
Japan showed no evidence of pollution from 
dumping by Russia or the former U.S.S.R. 
(Yamada et al. 1999), even immediately after 
14GBq of liquid radioactive waste was dumped 
into the Japan/East Sea in October 1993 (Hong et 
al. 1999a).  The ratio of 
239
Pu/
240
Pu in the 
sediments was consistent with global fallout 
(Yamada et al. 1999).  
 
Persistent solids 
 
Waldichuk (1990) reported that entanglement by 
plastic driftnets, other fishing gear and other 
plastic objects, such as grocery bags, was 
estimated to be responsible for killing two million 
sea birds and 100,000 marine mammals each year. 
Entanglement was considered to be a particularly 
significant problem for endangered species.  There 
have not been many studies on the prevalence and 
effect of plastics in the North Pacific in the last ten 
years, but the research that is available supports 
the seriousness of the problem and demonstrates 
that plastics affect different species to different 
degrees.  Sea birds (Blight and Burger 1997;  
Robards et al. 1995) are particularly strongly 
affected, since they tend either to ingest the plastic 
or become entangled by it.  Benthic communities 
can be smothered by the plastics, which are slow 
to break down (Uneputty and Evans 1997).  
California sea lions, however, although many of 
them do become entangled in plastic, are seven 
times more likely to be shot than entangled, 
according to data from a rehabilitation centre in 
California (Goldstein et al. 1999). 
 
Domestic pollution 
 
Domestic pollution consists of sewage and some 
industrial wastes that end up in the municipal 
treatment system (from hospitals, dentists, 
photographic processors and other industries).  
Many of the industrial wastes are toxic, and some 
bioaccumulate or biomagnify.  Nutrients from 
sewage can cause eutrophication, bacterial 
pollution and harmful algal blooms, whereas other 
components are known to disrupt endocrine 
processes (Goldberg 1995;  Kramer and Giesy 
1995;  Shang et al. 1999).  Waldichuk (1990) 
described sewage-related problems in coastal 
British Columbia and commented that the situation 
was worse in Asia, where there was a much larger 
human population.  The impact of sewage 
discharge is site-specific, depending on, among 
other things, cumulative loadings, rate of coastal 
flushing and mechanism of discharge (e.g., deep, 
shallow, diffuse).  In western North America, 
untreated and secondarily-treated sewage is still 
discharged to coastal waters by some cities (e.g., 
Victoria and Vancouver) (Thomson et al. 1995), 
but upgrades are proceeding in many areas, and it 
seems likely that the impact of municipal outfalls 
on shallow coastal waters has been declining 
despite population increases.  Widely-distributed 
poorly-maintained septic systems continue to 
contaminate shorelines in many places, however. 
 
In the Asian marginal seas, domestic pollution is 
especially severe:  less than 10% of China’s 
domestic and industrial waste is treated before it 
flows into rivers or the ocean (Morton and 
Blackmore 2001).  The degree of nutrient 
pollution and eutrophication varies geographically 
(Ma et al. 1997).  In the Japan/East Sea, between 
1982 and 1995, domestic pollution of water and 
sediment increased, changing the availability of a 
substrate for barnacle larvae to settle on and 
causing an increased mortality of young barnacles 
and decreased growth rate where the temperature 
 
  
had risen above 18°C and dissolved oxygen 
concentrations were critically low (Silina and 
Ovsyannikova 2000).   
 
In Tokyo Bay, organic pollution is so severe that 
benthic organisms decline in summer when a 
thermocline is formed in the water column 
(Hisano and Hayase 1991).  Over a period of 15 
and 18 years respectively, Hirota (1979) and 
others (Anakubo and Murano 1991;  Nishida, 
1985;  Nomura and Murano 1992;  Uye 1994) 
recorded that for the Seto Inland Sea and Tokyo 
Bay, Japan, as eutrophication problems grew, 
there were zooplankton community structure shifts 
from a calanoid copepod to a cyclopoid-dominated 
one.  In Tokyo Bay, the copepod community 
became dominated by Oithona davisae.  These 
authors also recorded a shift in phytoplankton 
community structure towards small dinoflagellates 
and diatoms.  Pollution thus seems to favour 
dinoflagellate feeders, such as O. davisae. 
Furthermore, the anoxic bottom-water formed in 
Tokyo Bay from organic enrichment and 
stratification acts selectively to advantage or 
disadvantage plankton life cycles.  Copepod eggs 
that are spawned freely into the water column may 
sink onto the seabed where they are adversely 
affected by oxygen-deficient water, resulting in 
heavy recruitment loss.  Inseminated O. davisae, 
however, which carries its eggs in egg sacs, can 
complete its life cycle by avoiding anoxic habitats. 
Recruitment of egg-carrying copepods would thus 
be favoured and O. davisae comes to dominate the 
resident community.  Formation of oxygen 
deficient bottom water might also be detrimental 
to copepods with no flexible vertical distribution. 
For example, male Parvocalanus crassiroustris 
and species of Acartia remain in deeper waters, 
especially late in the day (Ueda 1987). 
 
In the Yellow Sea the concentration of inorganic 
phosphorus is increasing (Ma et al. 1997), and 
eutrophication is thought to be responsible for 
more frequent HABs (Jiao and Guo 1996;  You et 
al. 1994).  In the East China Sea, human deaths 
have resulted from ingestion of toxic bivalves and 
gastropods; the HABs responsible for the toxicity 
of the shellfish are thought to have been caused by 
eutrophication in combination with physical 
processes, including coastal upwelling and climate 
events (Chen and Gu 1993). 
Twenty to fifty percent of the “new” nitrogen in 
the Yellow Sea comes from atmospheric 
deposition and groundwater (Paerl 1997).  Urban 
and agricultural discharges to groundwater are 
increasing (Paerl 1997), and rain over the Yellow 
Sea has a high concentration of nutrients from air 
pollution (Zhang et al. 1999).  Groundwater and 
rain bypass the estuarine filters and can cause 
eutrophication and HABs at a considerable 
distance from the source.  Atmospheric deposition 
of nitrate varies seasonally, with higher 
concentrations in the winter, when there is less 
precipitation (Zhang and Liu 1994); the 
episodicity of the high atmospheric delivery of 
nutrients corresponds with HABs in the nearby 
Pacific Ocean (Zhang 1994;  Zhang and Liu 
1994). 
 
Due to increasing population and a relatively small 
land base, Korean bays have become sinks for a 
variety of domestic and industrial wastes.  In 
Chinhae Bay, oxygen deficient conditions due to 
organic pollution perturbated the resident marine 
benthic communities in 1989 (Lim and Hong 
1994; Yang 1991).  In the early 1990s, Shihwa 
Lake was formed by impounding a marine bay on 
the west coast of Korea with a 12.7 km long 
barrier.  The bay, which became stratified by salt 
and temperature, then went eutrophic and the sea 
bed became anoxic.  Sea bed levels of nutrients 
and industrial wastes increased and macrobenthic 
diversity collapsed with blooms of Polydora ligni 
and Capitella capitata in winter (Lee and Cha 
1997).  
 
Aquaculture, a source of organic carbon, nutrients, 
and industrial chemicals (antifoulants, 
pharmaceuticals, contaminants in feedstock), is an 
expanding industry.  Although total amounts of 
materials from any one operation may be small, 
there is the potential for impacts close to the 
operation and, with sufficient density in poorly-
flushed coastal waters, there could be regional 
impacts.  For example, fish culture in meshed 
cages in a bay in southern Japan resulted in an 
azoic sea bed with summer defaunation followed 
by recolonization the following spring (Tsutsumi 
1995).  Molluscs were progressively replaced by 
polychaetes as the dominant macrobenthos below 
the cages.   
 
  
Components of a warning system 
 
The multiple stresses briefly reviewed here 
provide an enormous and increasing challenge to 
North Pacific coasts and shelves.  These stresses 
do not operate independently but, rather, interact 
with one another in a manner that varies among 
locations (Fig. 7).  If we survey the Pacific Rim, 
we see that the Asian coasts are most immediately 
threatened on a large scale by over-fishing, 
destructive fishing practices, nutrient loadings and 
inputs of contaminants from large populations 
undergoing industrial transition (Morton and 
Blackmore 2001).  To the far north, local sources 
dwindle in importance and climate change and 
long-range transport of contaminants become 
leading causes for concern (Alexander and 
Windom 1999;  Rice and Shigaev 1997;  
Shaporenko 1997;  Vaschenko 2000).  Finally, for 
the temperate west coast of North America, 
climate change, over-fishing and long-range 
contaminant transport remain important issues, 
with contaminant loadings to enclosed seas (Strait 
of Georgia, Puget Sound, San Francisco Bay) 
assuming high local profiles (see for example, 
Macdonald and Crecelius 1994;  Parsons 1996; 
Ross et al. 2000;  Sañudo-Wilhelmy and Flegal 
1992). 
 
The challenge that ocean scientists must meet if 
we are to avert the demise of coastal ecosystems 
is:  (1) to produce observations that forewarn us 
(trends);  (2) to understand ocean processes 
sufficiently to associate ecosystem response with 
cause (human or natural) and;  (3) to assign the 
order of importance of stresses put upon coastal 
seas by human activities.  Clearly, for this 
scientific effort to be of benefit it must be 
translated into action, for example, either to reduce 
or to eliminate contaminants at local, regional and 
international scales.  One strategy widely 
promoted to conserve biological resources is the 
development of a network of Marine Protected 
Areas (MPAs).  If carefully chosen, MPAs provide 
undisputed benefits for conservation (Roberts et 
al. 2001).  However, they allow us little room for 
complacency as they provide no protection against

majority of the stresses that threaten our oceans 
(Fig. 7).  To recognize and prioritize threats to 
coasts from these disparate stressors will require 
coherent observations and research, which we 
suggest should include at least the following 
elements. 
 
Box models, other models and case studies 
 
Box models are especially useful in enclosed seas 
where inputs and outputs can in principle be 
tightly constrained, but they may also be applied 
to open shelves (Chen et al, 2002;  Johannessen et 
al. 2002;  Liu et al. 2000).  Beginning with water, 
salt, and nutrients (Gordon et al. 1996), budgets 
can be scaled up to include sediments, organic 
carbon and contaminants.  These budgets then 
allow a preliminary assessment of human loadings 
compared with fluxes and budgets in the 
undisturbed system.  From such an assessment, an  
 
 
  
estimation can be made of the likely scale (local, 
regional) of impact, and human loadings can be 
ranked to allow for a logical approach to 
mitigation.  An example from the Seto Sea (Fig. 8) 
illustrates that human loadings dominate the zinc 
and copper budgets and that most of the 
contaminant load of these metals ends up in its 
sediments.   Box models provide a schematic 
understanding, which can help to validate the 
output of more sophisticated ones.   
 
 
 
Fig. 8 An example of the application of a box 
model to an enclosed sea.  Mass balances are 
given for copper and zinc in the Seto Island Sea 
(tons/yr).  L1 identifies load into the sea, L2 
identifies load into sediment, and zinc loadings are 
given in parentheses (Hoshika et al. 1988). 
 
Box models provide a solid foundation upon 
which to build case studies (Macdonald et al. 
2000b).  Case studies can be applied to a relatively 
constrained environmental impact such as the 
disposal of mine tailings to a coastal fjord (Ellis et 
al. 1995), to a specific chemical like PCB, HCH or 
toxaphene (Macdonald et al. 2000b) and may 
provide the basis to initiate appropriate 
environmental action (Lindstrom and Renescu 
1994). 
 
Time-series observations 
 
The observation of change is one of the most 
powerful means to initiate action.  The difficulty, 
however, is to recognize it early enough to avert 
irreversible change, and to be able to draw clear 
inference from observations to causes so that 
appropriate action can be taken.  As shown in 
Figure 7 (dots), time series can be assembled at 
many points of the ocean system.  However, the 
meaning of such time series varies from point to 
point and, in many cases, multiple components of 
change act simultaneously, so that a simple 
observation (declining PCB levels with time) can 
be produced by more than one factor (e.g., reduced 
global emission, reduced local emission, change of 
atmospheric or ocean pathway through regime 
shift, changes to the food web structure (top-down 
or bottom-up)).  Generally, time series have been 
collected ad hoc without worrying about 
confounding factors or comparability with other 
time series.  It is time for the scientific community 
to develop coherent, intercomparable time series 
of sufficient sophistication to guide administrators 
toward appropriate action. 
 
Sediment cores 
 
Sediments provide well-recognized archives of the 
history of particle reactive contaminants and, as 
such, will remain a key resource to understanding 
current loadings of contaminants in the context of 
pre-industrial loadings (see, for example, Huh and 
Chen 1999;  Macdonald and Crecelius 1994). 
Finney et al. (2000) have demonstrated elegantly 
that in certain circumstances, sediment can record 
both the forcing (anadromous fish return) and 
effects (lake eutrophication), allowing a more 
secure inference of how climate change and 
human predation work together to affect fish 
escapement.  Such insights are not available in the 
instrumental observation record.  This study 
certainly points the way to more powerful 
application of sediment cores to sort out combined 
stresses;  for example, the findings of Finney et al. 
(2000) could be further expanded to consider the 
effects of fish on lake contaminants and, 
potentially, the effects of contaminants on fish 
(see, for example, Ewald et al. 1998;  Zhang et al. 
2001). 
 
Monitoring components of the food web 
 
A food web provides an enormous scope for 
monitoring, from filter feeders (Beliaeff et al. 
1997) to apex predators (Addison and Smith 1998; 
Ross et al. 2000) to HABs (Yanagi 1988).  
Presently, time series data for any component of 
the food web in the North Pacific are extremely 
rare, and where there is such information, it often 
 
  
comprises few time series points, several or more 
years apart, and well after contaminants began to 
be released into the environment (for example see 
Fig. 6).  It is now recognized that contaminant 
burdens recorded by aquatic animals depend on 
their life histories and cycles they may exhibit 
(age, sex, size, season, prey).  With research, many 
of these factors can be taken into account through, 
for example, sampling strategy.  However, the 
food web itself is a dynamic system (Fig. 7) 
subject to alteration in a number of ways, as 
discussed earlier.   
 
The problem with monitoring individual 
components in the food web, therefore, is that a 
change in contaminant burden with time may have 
non-unique causes.  For example, a shift in a 
single trophic level produced by over fishing or 
eutrophication can produce a change in mercury 
concentration by a factor of 10 (Fig. 9).  The same 
problem exists for the organochlorines, which also 
biomagnify.  In the latter context, a particularly apt 
example was provided in the Great Lakes where 
the invasion of an exotic species, the zebra mussel 
(Dreissena polymporpha), led to a fundamental 
change in lake trophic structure and, presumably, 
to contaminant pathways (Morrison et al. 1998;  
Whittle et al. 2000).  Given the varied pressures 
on the aquatic food webs of the North Pacific 
reviewed here, it seems clear that we need to 
institute a monitoring programme that incorporates 
all trophic levels.  Furthermore, support data 
(stable isotope composition) must be assembled to 
help interpret changes in trophic level together 
with changes in contaminant burdens. 
 
Sample archives 
 
Tissue archives provide a safety net for ongoing 
monitoring.  We cannot hope to anticipate all 
future chemicals, nor can we predict accurately the 
sorts of changes that might occur in our 
ecosystems.  We can be sure, however, that new 
and better techniques will be developed with time 
to apply to problems of chemical contamination 
and ecosystem change.  For example, the change 
in trophic structure due to zebra mussel invasion 
of the Great Lakes would not have been identified 
without such archives (Kiriluk et al. 1999), nor 
would the relationship between this change and

N 
measurements (top panel, Hobson and Welch 
1992), and how biomagnification increases 
mercury concentration as trophic level is increased 
(bottom left, Atwell et al. 1998).  Alteration of the 
food web resulting in, for example, a change in the 
trophic level of fish can accordingly alter 
contaminant burdens observed in time series (after 
Whittle et al. 2000). 
 
contaminant burdens.  It is astonishing to note that 
the tissue archive applied to understanding what 
had occurred in this system was maintained 
unofficially with soft funding.  Recognizing the 
importance of tissue archives, we should 
institutionalize immediately the collection, 
cataloguing and storage of appropriate samples. 
 
Ecological indicators 
 
Monitoring environmental quality using chemical 
measurements tends to be prejudiced either toward 
chemical analyses for which we have developed 
skill, or toward chemicals known to cause 
environmental problems (the usual suspects).  As a 
consequence, one detects only those chemicals 
that have been sought, and unexpected chemicals  
 
 
  
are likely to go unrecognized.  Biological 
measurements are required, therefore, to alert us to 
the presence of unidentified chemicals that require 
the development of new analytical methods (the 
research to isolate and identify domoic acid, 
following shellfish poisoning of humans on 
Canada’s East Coast provides an excellent 
example (Addison and Stewart 1989)).  Although 
marine pollution is often presented as a chemical 
problem, our ultimate interest is not in the 
chemicals themselves, nor of their burdens in 
environmental media.  Rather, we would like to be 
able to relate chemical loadings to harmful effects 
on the structure and functioning of ecosystems 
(Addison 1996).  To do this requires the 
development of ecological indicators, the science 
of which is in its infancy.  The difficulty we face is 
that many of the relatively simple and affordable 
measurements (e.g., PCB burden in seal blubber) 
cannot be related confidently to animal health, and 
even less so to population health (Fig. 10), even 
though we suspect that certain clinical toxic 
thresholds may have been exceeded.  On the other 
hand, monitoring community structure and relating 
changes to chemical and other stresses is not only 
beyond our present understanding but also beyond 
our financial means.  A crucial task remains 
therefore, to develop indicators that exhibit 
reliability, robustness and specificity but which 
also are affordable.

of ecosystem monitoring with the complexity and 
relevance of the measurements (modified from 
Addison 1996). 
Conclusions 
 
Like Waldichuk (1990), we conclude that 
continental shelves and near shore areas of the 
North Pacific are under the greatest stress from 
chemical contaminants.  Increasing population and 
industrialization will increase that stress.  With 
either their restriction or elimination (PCBs, OC 
pesticides), global cycling of some of these 
contaminants have decreased;  however, it is likely 
that they will continue to cause concern for some 
time (Ross et al. 2000).  And we will discover new 
chemical problems to replace old ones (e.g., see 
Betts 2001;  Kramer and Giesy 1995;  Paasivirta 
1998). 
 
The problem we face is not just chemical 
contamination, but assault on coastal systems from 
multiple stressors.  Presently, we lack coherent 
observational networks, reliable inventories for 
contaminants, and an understanding of processes 
that would unequivocally distinguish real threats 
from perceived threats.  Given the degree of 
concern that pervades much of the literature cited 
here, it is surprising that the scientific and political 
communities of the North Pacific have not 
collaborated to conduct a regional assessment.  
The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment 
Programme (AMAP 1998) provides an apt 
example where international hurdles were 
overcome to produce a well-founded, science-
based review that led to action.  We therefore 
suggest that the highest priority for PICES should 
be to produce, within the next five years, an 
International North Pacific Assessment 
Programme.

Introduction 
 
The Climate Change and Carrying Capacity 
(CCCC) Program is the first major inter-
disciplinary initiative undertaken by the North 
Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES). 
Planning for this program began one year after the 
First Annual Meeting of PICES, and it has 
continued to be the major scientific integrating 
activity of PICES.  This report describes the 
CCCC Program, its objectives, activities, 
accomplishments and problems, and provides 
suggestions for future directions of the Program.  
 
This paper asks the central question:  how has the 
PICES CCCC Program contributed to the present 
understanding of the ecosystems of the North 
Pacific, and their potential responses to climate 
changes?  An underlying theme to this review is 
identification of those factors, which have either 
contributed to the success, or lack of success, of 
such a large multi-national and inter-disciplinary 
initiative, as a guide to developing other large 
scientific programs. 
 
Historical views of the North Pacific marine 
system 
 
In the mid-1500s in Japan, and the mid/late 1700s 
in North America, when Europeans were first 
exploring the North Pacific, they encountered 
highly maritime-adapted peoples and an ocean rich 
in resources, in particular salmon and marine 
mammals.  Estimates of the abundances of marine 
mammals in the North Pacific prior to industrial 
exploitation are necessarily sketchy, but range 
from tens of thousands to millions (Table 1).

marine mammals in the North Pacific prior to 
industrial exploitation (Glavin 2000;  Nichol and 
Heise 1992).

These resources spurred discovery of the North 
Pacific, fueling commerce with Asia and greasing 
the wheels of the industrial revolution in Europe 
(Glavin 2000).  Nothing is known, however, about 
the productivity or structure of the marine 
ecosystems that supported such large abundances 
of high trophic level species.  
 
Two hundred years later, in the 1960s and 1970s, 
understanding of the North Pacific marine system 
was firmly on a scientific basis.  Different 
domains were recognized in the physical and 
biological oceanography of the region (e.g., 
Dodimead et al. 1963).  However, the approaches 
to studying these domains differed:  offshore 
studies in the western Pacific emphasised a real 
coverage along transects, whereas offshore studies 
in the eastern Pacific focussed on time series and 
process studies at a few locations (e.g., Station 
PAPA).  It had also been recognized that the  
 
 
 
 
 
 
marine ecosystem, at least in the eastern oceanic 
subarctic North Pacific, appeared to function 
differently from that in the North Atlantic.  These 
differences were explained largely on the basis of 
the life cycle and vertical migratory behaviours of 
the large copepods in the North Pacific (e.g., 
Parsons and Lalli 1988). 
 
Twenty years later, in the 1990s, the scientific 
view of the North Pacific had changed again, with 
a different understanding of three key features: 
• the roles of iron and the microbial loop in 
explaining why the subarctic North Pacific is a 
high-nutrient but low-chlorophyll region (e.g., 
Harrison et al. 1999); 
• the extent to which North Pacific marine 
ecosystems are coupled to larger basin-scale 
oceanographic and atmospheric processes 
(teleconnections), such as tropical forcing (El 
Niño – Southern Oscillation), high latitude 
forcing (Arctic Oscillation, Thompson and 
Wallace 1998), and east-west Pacific basin 
oscillation (Pacific Decadal Oscillation, 
Mantua et al. 1997);  
• the connections between environmental 
changes and marine population fluctuations 
(e.g., Beamish and Bouillon 1993;  Anderson 
and Piatt 1999). 
Therefore, the major question is:  how has the 
PICES CCCC Program contributed to this recent 
view of the structure and functioning of the marine 
ecosystems of the North Pacific? 
 
Origin and structure of the CCCC Program 
 
The seeds of the CCCC Program were planted by 
PICES’ Working Group 6 (Subarctic Gyre), which 
was established at the First Annual Meeting of 
PICES in 1992.  Based in part on the activities of 
this Working Group (Hargreaves and Sugimoto 
1993), and recognizing that the Scientific 
Committees of PICES were established mostly 
along traditional disciplines (such as physics, 
biology, etc.), the Governing Council of PICES 
approved the development of a CCCC Program at 
its Second Annual Meeting (North Pacific Marine 
Science Organization 1994).  The scientific 
program was elaborated at the Third Annual 
Meeting to include (North Pacific Marine Science 
Organization 1995):  
• a strategy for determining the carrying 
capacity for high trophic level carnivores in 
the subarctic North Pacific;  and  
• a plan for a cooperative study of how changes 
in ocean conditions affect the productivity of 
key fish species in the subarctic North Pacific 
and the coastal zones of the Pacific Rim. 
These issues embodied the two major themes of 
the Program:  carrying capacity and climate 
change.  It was also noted at this Third Annual 
Meeting that member countries were developing 
national programs affiliated with the emerging 
Global Oceans Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC) 
program (GLOBEC Science Plan 1997), and that it 
was therefore desirable for the PICES–
CCCC/GLOBEC science plan to be developed in a 
timely manner to guide coordinated planning 
among PICES member nations. 
 
The Science Plan for CCCC was developed during 
a large workshop held prior to the Third Annual 
Meeting in 1994, and the Implementation Plan was 
developed a few months later at a smaller 
workshop in 1995 both published as PICES 
Scientific Report No. 4 (PICES 1996).  At about 
this time, the PICES CCCC Program was accepted 
as a Regional Program of the evolving 
International Geosphere – Biosphere Program 
(IGBP) GLOBEC core project which greatly 
broadened the affiliation of the CCCC Program 
with global environmental change research 
networks and provided integration with the global 
comparisons being conducted by these networks.  
 
The ultimate goal of the CCCC program was set:  
“to forecast the consequences of climate 
variability on the ecosystems of the subarctic 
Pacific” 
and the general question was framed as: 
“how do interannual and decadal variation in 
ocean conditions affect the species dominance, 
biomass, and productivity of the key 
zooplankton and fish species in the ecosystems 
of the PICES area?” 
(PICES 1996, p. 22 and 61).  The Science Plan 
identified eight Key Scientific Questions, which 
were “re-mapped” into four Central Scientific 
Issues in the Implementation Plan  (PICES 1996, 
p. 61): 
 
 
 
 
 
Physical Forcing:  What are the characteristics of 
climate variabilty, can interdecadal patterns be 
identified, how and when do they arise? 
 
Lower Trophic Level Response:  How do primary 
and secondary producers respond in productivity, 
and in species and size composition, to climate 
variability in different ecosystems of the subarctic 
Pacific? 
 
Higher Trophic Level Response:  How do life 
history patterns, distribution, vital rates, and 
population dynamics of higher trophic level 
species respond directly and indirectly to climate 
variability? 
 
Ecosystem Interactions:  How are subarctic Pacific 
ecosystems structured? Is it solely through bottom-
up forcing, or are there significant intra-trophic 
level and top-down effects? 
 
Consistent with other GLOBEC programs, the 
CCCC Science and Implementation Plans 
described five key research activities: 
• retrospective analyses 
• development of models 
• process studies 
• development of observational systems 
• data management 
The approach to study of the general question and 
its scientific issues was to pursue investigations on 
two broad spatial scales:  Regional and Basin 
(Table 2).  Regions were defined in general terms 
as including continental shelf and national waters, 
whereas the Basin spatial scale included the open 
oceanic waters. 
 
In 1997, the Terms of Reference for the CCCC 
Program were revised to: 
 
• integrate and stimulate national activities on 
the effects of climate variations on marine 
ecosystems of the subarctic North Pacific;  
• determine how the PICES Scientific 
Committees and Working Groups can support 
the Program;  
• identify national/international research 
programs with which CCCC could coordinate; 
• provide scientific direction.

To put the CCCC Program into action, and to 
involve as many people as possible, the 
Implementation Panel proposed establishing three 
“Task Teams” to integrate the key research 
activities and the two spatial scales of the 
Program.  These were: 
MODEL – to advance the development of 
conceptual / theoretical and modelling studies;  
BASS (BASin Scale) – to develop the basin scale 
component of CCCC; 
REX (Regional EXperiments) – to develop inter-
comparisons among regional (national) studies.  
 
A fourth Task Team, “MONITOR”, was 
established in 1997 to:  
• review and suggest improvements to  
monitoring by PICES Nations;  
• consult on designing a PICES monitoring 
system (calibrations, standardisation, etc.); 
• assist with development of a coordinated 
monitoring program to detect and describe 
events that strongly affect the subarctic 
Pacific;  
• report to CCCC on the montoring needs in the 
subarctic Pacific to be implemented in GOOS  
(Global Ocean Observing System). 
 
Each Task Team had two appointed Co-Chairmen, 
representing opposite sides of the Pacific.  A 
larger oversight body, called the Implementation 
Panel of the CCCC Program, was established.  It 
consisted of at least two members appointed from 
 
 
 
 
each PICES member countries plus other members 
from the Task Teams.  Its role was to provide 
coordination of the CCCC Program and input from 
the member countries.  As this Panel was 
relatively large (~27 members), an Executive 
Committee (EC) of the Implementation Panel was 
formed to provide oversight of the Implementation 
Panel;  this EC was composed of the two CCCC 
Co-Chairmen and the Co-Chairmen of each of the 
Task Teams.  The Chairmen of the CCCC 
Program since its inception are identified in  
Table 3.

Highlights of major accomplishments 
 
The CCCC Program has produced significant 
accomplishments.  The following represents some 
of the highlights for each Task Team. 
 
MODEL 
The major task of MODEL is to develop the 
modelling components of the CCCC Program.  In 
its early meetings, MODEL identified the 
modelling needs of the CCCC scientific 
community (Perry et al. 1997).  It was concluded 
that the development of lower trophic level 
models, and their coupling with physical models 
and with higher trophic level models, lagged 
behind development of physical models for the 
North Pacific basin.  This led to a significant effort 
to develop a lower trophic level model that would 
serve the needs of the CCCC research community. 
 
Development of this model is described by 
Megrey et al. (2000), Eslinger et al. (2000), and 
Kishi et al. (2001).  It was named “NEMURO” for 
North Pacific Ecosystem Model for 
Understanding Regional Oceanography.  The 
model (Fig. 1) consists of 11 state variables, 
defines fluxes of both nitrogen and silicon, and 
includes the seasonal vertical migrations of the 
large copepods (e.g., Neocalanus spp. in the NE 
Pacific).  It was initially developed as a diagnostic 
tool, and applied to one western Pacific and one 
eastern Pacific location.  The model appeared to 
get results “in the right ballpark”, and it is being 
used to investigate the effects on upper trophic 
levels of shunting a large fraction of primary 
productivity through a microbial loop rather than 
directly through the autotrophic phyoplankton. 
Recent activities have involved refinements to, 
and further testing of, the model.  There have also 
been collaborations with the BASS Task Team to 
couple the NEMURO model to upper trophic level 
models such as ECOPATH and ECOSIM (Walters 
et al. 1997l;  McFarlane et al. 2001), and 
collaborations with the REX Task Team to use the 
NEMURO model to explore time series of growth 
variability in pelagic fishes such as herring. 
 
BASS 
The major task of BASS was to develop CCCC 
activities in the deep basins of the North Pacific. 
These regions were expected to need multi-
national support for research. Outstanding 
questions early in the CCCC Program were:  
• To what extent are the processes and 
structures in the eastern subarctic Pacific gyre 
like those in the western subarctic Pacific?   
• Do they respond similarly to similar forcings 
and disturbances?   
To address these questions, BASS hosted a very 
successful Science Board symposium in 1997, 
which resulted in a dedicated volume of papers in 
the primary literature (Beamish et al. 1999).   
 
This symposium was extremely important for 
enhancing east-west collaboration as each paper 
was authored by at least one Asian and one North 
American scientist.  Papers in this volume 
identified teleconnections between atmospheric 
processes in the central and eastern subarctic 
Pacific with oceanographic conditions in the 
Oyashio current area (Sekine 1999);  determined 
that plankton (Mackas and Tsuda 1999) and 
marine bird and mammal productivity (Springer et 
al. 1999) is higher in the western subarctic gyre 
than in the eastern gyre;  but, in contrast to the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 1 NEMURO Model (Megrey et al. 2000).  State variables are the boxes with names, fluxes in black 
represent nitrogen, fluxes in red represent silicon, thick black line represents vertical migration by large 
zooplankton. 
 
previous findings, fish species diversity is greater 
in the eastern subarctic gyre (Brodeur et al. 1999).  
Outstanding research questions were also 
identified, such as the role of iron in plankton 
production, and why the western gyre should be 
more productive than the eastern gyre (Harrison et 
al. 1999). 
Considering the questions and potential 
significance relating to the role of iron on 
productivity processes in the subarctic North 
Pacific, an Advisory Panel on an Iron Fertilization 
Experiment in the subarctic Pacific (IFEP) was 
formed in 1999 under the BASS Task Team. 
 
 
 
 
The objective of this Panel is to oversee and 
coordinate an experimental fertilization of iron in 
the subarctic North Pacific, in order to examine 
the details of the responses of the lower trophic 
levels (e.g., Harrison et al. 1999).  The Panel plans 
to identify similarities and differences in the 
responses of the planktonic ecosystems in the 
eastern and western subarctic gyre to the addition 
of iron (e.g., differences in species composition, 
export flux rates, etc.).  There are strong linkages 
of this Panel with the emerging IGBP core 
program on Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere 
Studies (SOLAS).  
 
Significant efforts have also been made between 
BASS and the MODEL Task Team to compare 
lower trophic level processes with upper trophic 
level responses, by integrating the NEMURO 
model with an ECOSIM model of the subarctic 
North Pacific (McFarlane et al. 2001).  Details of 
this have been noted in the previous section on the 
MODEL Task Team accomplishments.  
 
MONITOR 
The youngest Task Team, MONITOR, has both 
backward-looking and forward-looking 
components, by being responsible for retrospective 
analyses of past changes in the subarctic Pacific, 
and designing observational systems to detect 
future changes.   
 
In 1999, MONITOR hosted the Science Board 
symposium on the “Nature and impacts of North 
Pacific climate regime shifts” which was 
subsequently published in the primary literature 
(Hare et al. 2000).  Papers in this symposium 
provided further evidence from around the North 
Pacific for a major shift in 1976/77, and provided 
evidence to suggest that additional changes may 
have occurred in 1989 and in 1999, although the 
mechanisms remain obscure.  Other papers found 
evidence for persistent changes at specific 
locations at other times. 
 
The MONITOR Task Team is also the contact 
point within PICES for a North Pacific monitoring 
program (Dugdale et al. 1999;  McFarlane et al. 
2001).  As one component of this, MONITOR has 
been successful at obtaining independent sources 
of funding for an in-water observational program.  
They established an Advisory Panel on the 
Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey, and 
initiated a pilot project to sample plankton and 
oceanographic properties using commercial ships 
of opportunity. Five north-nouth transects were 
conducted through spring and summer 2000, and 
one east-west transect across the northern Pacific 
in June-July 2000 (Fig. 2).   
 
These sampling programs use methods that are 
well-developed in the Atlantic Ocean (Warner and 
Hays 1994), and which provide an along-track 
spatial resolution of 18 km. Funding from the 
Exxon Valdes Oil Spill Trustee Council has been 
secured to continue the North Pacific CPR 
Program in 2002, and the data from existing 
surveys are being prepared for publication.

REX 
The REX Task Team was initially expected to 
encourage the development of “regional 
experiments” among the 10 identified regions of 
the Pacific continental margins (Table 2).  The 
role of REX in the CCCC community differed 
from other programs because it relied on national 
programs for development and design of research 
studies. The REX Task Team worked to identify 
data gaps within the PICES regions and 
communicated the potential for international co-
operation in support of comparison of results 
across large geographic regions (Hollowed et al. 
1998).  More recently, however, most PICES 
member nations have established GLOBEC 
programs, and the synergy during early planning 
appears to have been lost. REX has developed a 
workshop series on small pelagics, herring in 
particular, and has been assembling data on life 
history patterns of these fishes across the Pacific 
basin (McFarlane et al. 2001).  REX has also been 
examining temporal variations in size-at-age for 
fish species in coastal areas around the North 
Pacific rim, and is working to couple this 
information to the NEMURO model. 
 
The REX Task Team assisted national programs 
by providing a forum for discussion of project 
design and research goals and objectives.  Once 
national programs were established, REX 
established an annual scientific session within 
PICES to provide a forum for exchanges of results 
and innovations.  This session has attracted 
participation of researchers from a variety of 
academic disciplines. 
 
The major accomplishment of the REX Task 
Team has undoubtedly been the initiation of 
CCCC GLOBEC, and GLOBEC-like, programs 
around the North Pacific (Fig. 3):  
 
China 
The title of the Chinese GLOBEC program is 
“Ecosystem dynamics and sustainable utilisation 
of living resources in the East China and Yellow 
Sea” (Tang 2000).  Its program goals are to: 
• identify key processes of ecosystem dynamics, 
and improve predictive and modelling 
capabilities in the East China Sea and the 
Yellow Sea;  and  
• provide the scientific underpinnings for 
sustainable utilisation of marine ecosystems 
and the rational management of fisheries and 
other marine life.  
It consists of 12 projects.  
 
Korea 
The overall program goal is defined as providing a 
long-term science and strategic plan for Korean 
waters to establish effective and reasonable 
conservation and sustainable measures for 
fisheries and ecosystem management (Kim 2000). 
This program has developed several Task Teams, 
including retrospective data, scientific program 
development, capacity building; and fisheries and 
ecosystem management approaches (Fig. 4).  Note 
one of the specific relationships includes 
“Consider the research priorities of the PICES 
CCCC Program”.  
 
Japan 
The Japan GLOBEC program has several research 
activities (Terazaki 1997): 
• the dynamics of the food chain through 
zooplankton and micronekton, which 
examines how changes in ocean physics 
resulting from global climate changes affect 
the structure and dynamics of marine food 
chains;  
• the dynamics of the responses of marine 
ecosystems to climate change, which 
examines variability of fish stocks in major 
marine systems as a response to global 
changes;  and  
• the development and application of new 
technologies for measurement and modelling 
in marine ecosystems. 
The program has been supported by the Ministry 
of Education, Science, Culture and Sport;  the 
Japan Fisheries Agency of the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries;  the Japan 
Meteorological Agency and the Japan 
Oceanographic Data Center of the Ministry of 
Transportation; and the Science and Technology 
Agency of Japan.  
 
The Fisheries Research Institute of Japan has been 
conducting GLOBEC-like programs over the 
period of 1997-2002 with VENFISH (Variation of 
the oceanic ENvironment and FISH production in

the northwestern Pacific) and the FRECS program, 
which is scheduled for 2000-2005 (FRECS:  
Fluctuation of Recruitment of fish eggs and larvae 
by changes of spawning grounds and transport 
patterns in the East China Sea).  The main subject 
of VENFISH is bottom-up control processes from 
phytoplankton and zooplankton production to the 
recruitment of fish, in particular the Pacific saury 
(Cololabris saira).  The FRECS program aims to 
understand the mechanisms of environmental 
impacts on the spawning grounds and their 
linkages to recruitment;  the mechanisms by which 
eggs and larvae are injected into the Tsushima and 
Kuroshio Currents and are carried to coastal areas;  
and factors affecting survival during growth 
processes.  Target species are jack mackerel 
(Trachurus japonicus) and the Japanese common 
squid (Todarodes pacificus).  The findings of these 
programs are expected to improve estimations of 
Allowable Biological Catches for these species. 
 
United States  
United States activities conducted by GLOBEC in 
the North Pacific are extensive;  U.S. GLOBEC 
programs are described by Batchelder (2002).  The 
U.S. GLOBEC Northeast Pacific program (NEP) 
has research nodes in the central Gulf of Alaska 
and the Calofornia Current System.  The NEP 
GLOBEC program is jointly funded by National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s 
(NOAA) Coastal Ocean Program (COP) and the 
National Science Foundation (NSF). 
 
The principal goal of the U.S. GLOBEC program 
is understanding how changes in the atmospheric 
forcing and circulation affect the productivity of 
the coastal ecosystems, and the survival of 
juvenile salmon after they enter the ocean.  A 
central hypothesis is that the spatial and temporal 
variability in mesoscale circulation is a dominant 
physical forcing that impacts production, biomass, 
and distribution of plankton.  The U.S. GLOBEC 
research team consists of 34 funded projects and 
90 investigators from 26 institutions.  In addition, 
several GLOBEC-like programs were funded in 
the United States.   
 
The COP supported programs in the Bering Sea 
and west coast.  The Bering Sea programs (Bering 
Sea FOCI and Southeast Bering Sea Carrying  
 
Capacity Regional Study) are described by 
Macklin (2000).  The COP study on the west coast 
(Pacific Northwest Coastal Ecosystems Regional 
Study) is described by Parrish and Litle (2000).  
The National Science Foundation also funded 
GLOBEC-like research programs including the 
Arctic Research Initiative in the Bering Sea, and 
the Coastal Ocean Processes (COOP) program off 
the coast of Oregon.  The National Marine 
Fisheries Service (NMFS) supported two 
GLOBEC-like programs in the Gulf of Alaska:  
the Ocean Carrying Capacity program that 
targeted responses of salmon to climate shifts, and 
the Fisheries Oceanography Coordinated 
Investigations (FOCI) which is described by 
Kendall and Schumacher (1996). 
 
The Southeast Bering Sea Carrying Capacity 
Study (Macklin 2001) has components on 
monitoring, process studies, modelling, and 
retrospective analyses.  The program has the 
following central scientific issues: 
• How does climate variability influence the 
Bering Sea ecosystem? 
• What limits population growth on the Bering 
Sea shelf? 
• How are forage and apex fish species linked 
through energetics and life history? 
• How do oceanographic conditions on the shelf 
influence biological distributions? 
• What influences primary and secondary 
production regimes? 
The principal field seasons were from 1996 to 
1998, and results are now being analysed.  During 
this period, the Bering Sea appears to have 
undergone a significant shift in production 
characteristics and species composition, and the 
SEBSCC program is well-placed to help 
understand these shifts. 
 
The Ocean Carrying Capacity program (Helle 
1999) in coastal Alaska is addressing the impacts 
of changes in the productivity of the North Pacific 
Ocean on Pacific salmon.  Specifically, the 
program is examining the effects of ocean 
productivity on salmonid carrying capacity, and 
changes in the biological characteristics of Pacific 
salmon in the Alaska region. It has three major 
components: 
 
 
 
 
• distribution and migrations of juvenile, 
immature, and mature salmon and associated 
species in coastal waters; 
• distribution and migration of immature and 
maturing salmon in offshore waters;  and 
• understanding the influence of marine climate 
change on the abundance, age, and sizes of 
Pacific salmon in the past, so as to understand 
present and future changes. 
 
Canada 
The major objectives of the Pacific component of 
the Canada GLOBEC program were to determine 
how physical and biological processes affect the 
ecosystem structure off the west coast of Canada. 
The key issues for the Canadian program (Fig. 5; 
Mackas and Perry 1999) are: 
• seasonality and timing matches between 
physics and biology;  
• freshwater inputs, and effects on mixing and 
transport;   
• advective coupling among continental shelf, 
margin and the deep ocean;   
• interactions between zooplankton and fish 
populations.  
Research was conducted at three spatial scales:  
the west coast of Vancouver Island, examining 
shelf-scale processes;  the coast of British 
Columbia, examining regional scale events;  and 
the deep NE Pacific, examining large-scale events 
and how they are coupled to the coastal and shelf 
regions of British Columbia. 
 
The project had a mix of in situ observational and 
process studies, retrospective analyses, and 
modelling.  The active phase of the program is 
now over, and results are being prepared for 
publication. 
 
As a conservative estimate, these GLOBEC and 
GLOBEC-like programs, inspired and coordinated 
in large part by the PICES CCCC Program, have 
contributed in total over US$6 million per year to 
marine ecosystem research in the North Pacific 
over the past decade.  Most of these programs are 
still on-going, and it will be the challenge for REX 
and the CCCC, in collaboration with IGBP 
GLOBEC, to integrate the findings from these 
programs over the basin and global scales.

the Canada GLOBEC project (Mackas and Perry, 
1999), illustrating forcings on fish populations 
from direct physical influences to indirect 
influences through the food web. 
 
Problems 
 
The PICES CCCC Program has experienced its 
share of problems, which is not surprising in a 
large international program spanning an entire 
ocean basin.  A major problem has been the heavy 
administrative structure.  While it is desirable to 
have places for many people to become involved, 
the structure of the CCCC Program has become 
too large (Table 4).  The consequences have been 
a reduction in the flow of information and ideas, 
redundancy in meetings, lack of true participation, 
and difficulty in filling all these positions.

Change and Carrying Capacity Program.

A second problem is lack of direct funding, since 
program elements are funded separately by each 
nation.  Even though there is coordination of 
programs through REX, each nation also has its 
own priorities for research.  The result is that 
while the CCCC Program identifies an overall 
structure and over-arching questions, each element 
is actually assembled from the nationally-funded 
programs, which can leave gaps and missing 
pieces from the overall CCCC Program design.   
 
The program has also not integrated as well with 
other PICES Scientific Committees as was 
expected at the outset, and it still needs much work 
on coodinating data management issues and 
creating a data legacy from the Program.  Despite 
these issues, however, the CCCC Program has 
encouraged a tremendous infusion of new 
resources to be devoted to the marine sciences in 
the North Pacific Ocean. 
 
Overall assessment of the CCCC Program 
 
How has the CCCC program contributed to the 
changed view of the North Pacific Ocean, as 
outlined at the beginning of this paper? 
Development of the NEMURO model and its 
connections with upper trophic level models, and 
the iron fertilization experiment, are providing 
further understanding of what drives lower trophic 
level productivity and its consequences in this 
ocean.  The BASS symposium and publication and 
the regional programs developed because of 
CCCC, have improved understanding of the 
similarities, differences, and connections among 
the eastern and western subarctic Pacific basins 
and with atmospheric forcing.  The MONITOR 
symposium and publication on climate shifts, the 
CPR program, and the recent REX workshops 
have provided understanding of the large (basin) 
scale synchrony of marine populations and how 
they are connected to atmospheric and 
oceanographic processes.  
 
Has the CCCC Program been a success or failure? 
The answer depends to some extent on how one 
interprets the principal objective of the Program.  
If one believes the goal was to stimulate and 
integrate programs on climate variations and 
marine ecosystems in the North Pacific, the 
answer must be that the CCCC Program has been 
an outstanding success.  If one believes the goal 
was to initiate a co-operative study with its own 
observational program of how changes in ocean 
conditions affect lower and upper trophic levels 
(as some have suggested the CCCC should have 
done as the Program developed), then the answer 
might be somewhat less successful.   
 
As we have pointed out at the beginning of this 
review, the initial objectives for the Program 
clearly centered around developing and 
coordinating research activities under a GLOBEC 
umbrella, and we believe the CCCC Program has 
far exceeded these goals. 
 
Perry (1996) identified key features leading to the 
success of a large inter-disciplinary, but 
regionally-based, fisheries oceanography project, 
FOCI.  These included a focus on a single region 
(Shelikof Strait, Alaska), a single species (walleye 
pollock, Theragra chalcogramma), and a focussed 
hypothesis (centred on the early life stages).  
These allowed coordinated planning and 
simplified the logistics of observational projects.  
Another key point was consistent institutional 
involvement and stability of program management 
and administrative personnel.   
 
The CCCC Program has none of these 
characteristics.  The CCCC includes many 
different regions (12), many different species from 
all trophic levels, and many different nations, 
institutions, and administrative personnel.  This 
resulted in the funding for GLOBEC programs in 
some nations terminating before funding in other 
nations started.  The CCCC Program, however, 
was initially envisaged to identify issues, to 
initiate and facilitate planning, to coordinate 
programs once begun, and to integrate and 
synthesize analyses and conclusions on the scale 
of the North Pacific Ocean.  In this context, PICES 
and its CCCC Program have provided an on-going 
forum for presentation and discussion of 
hypotheses, issues and results, even if these have 
not always been translated into national programs 
or action. 
 
Future directions 
 
The CCCC Program is at a cross-roads, where it 
must move towards integration and conclusion of 
 
 
 
 
its existing activities, or move in new directions. 
One of the most pressing needs is to revise the 
administrative structure of the Program.  This 
might include disbanding the Implementation 
Panel in favour of plenary meetings of all Task 
Team members as needed, and combining the 
REX and BASS Task Teams – a process which is 
already taking place to some extent in practice. 
The Program must also improve synthesis and 
coordination, perhaps with a re-focusing of its 
objectives.  The emerging Ecosystem Status 
Report project of PICES could serve as a means to 
summarize what is known about the North Pacific 
marine system, and to identify the key unknowns 
that need further study, perhaps coordinated by the 
CCCC Program.  The developing Global Ocean 
Observing System may also provide similar focus 
and questions.  The Program could also be 
terminated, and PICES could begin a new and 
different initiative.  However, this would leave 
several important problems unresolved, which 
would need some follow-up to complete 
adequately.  Such issues include coordination of 
monitoring the North Pacific, how changes in 
lower trophic levels affect the upper trophic levels, 
and early detection of regime shifts and their 
impacts.  
 
PICES should serve as a source of scientific 
information on issues related to the North Pacific 
marine system.  One model that might be 
considered is that of the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC), which provides 
scientific assessments of significant environmental 
issues, in this instance on climate change.  The 
CCCC Program could be the start of this for 
climate impacts in the North Pacific, and could 
define and develop our ability to distinguish these 
from more direct human forcing.  
 
In conclusion, we wish to reflect back to the 
changing understanding of the nature of the North 
Pacific that was outlined at the beginning of this 
report, in particular as represented by the large 
populations of marine mammals.  Is the structure 
and function of the North Pacific marine system 
different now than it was 200 years ago? 
Considering the significant declines in marine 
mammal populations, what has happened to the 
“excess production” that used to fuel these large 
upper trophic level populations?  What can we 
learn from these events that will help us 
understand future responses of the North Pacific to 
change?  These are the continuing tasks of the 
CCCC Program.
