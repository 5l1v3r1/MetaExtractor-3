The PICES Study Group on Human Dimensions found an extremely rich scientific and cultural context 
for fisheries in the PICES area.  For this reason we have selected two illustrations for our report.  The first 
shows the “Safe-catch festival” in Japan where local fishers are praying about the safety of fisheries 
operations and big catch.  The second shows the Fishermen’s Memorial in Seattle, U.S.A. as 
representative of the risks and rewards of fishing in the North Pacific. The message in all of this is that 
human dimensions of coastal and marine ecosystems are important and worthy of study.

Executive Summary 
 
 
In October 2009, the Study Group on Human Dimensions was established under the guidance of the PICES 
Science Board.  The objective of the Study Group was to review the role of social science practices applied in 
decision-making in marine sectors around the world.  In order to fully utilize the limited life span of the Study 
Group, the main focus was on ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), with the following terms of 
reference: 
 
1. Review how social science has been used/applied globally and regionally in EBFM and the theoretical basis 
for these practices; 
2. Review the social scientific tools and information available for EBFM in PICES member countries; 
3. Develop an inventory of practices for use of social economic information appropriate to the circumstances 
in each of PICES member countries (the term “best practice” is not used because it is expected what is 
“best” will vary and be determined according to the circumstances in each of PICES member countries); 
4. Prepare a final report on activities and findings of the group and make recommendations on the desirability 
of establishing an expert group related to socio-economic sciences within PICES and on the role of such a 
group.  For example, based on sound social and economic science, the potential expert group should first 
survey/assess the needs of potential stakeholders for FUTURE products, and scientifically clarify 
differences in societal objectives among stakeholders in different sectors and countries.  
 
The Study Group found that there is a wide range of social scientific tools that can add value to natural 
scientific knowledge for better communication with society.  For example, the social sciences can contribute to 
defining/selecting goals, objectives, indicators, and targets.  Many quantitative analytical tools have been 
developed to assess the performance of specific measures which will facilitate inter-disciplinary collaboration 
among the natural and social sciences.  When implementing EBFM measures, spatial, temporal, and 
organizational scales matter.  The social sciences have also developed analytical tools for better coordination 
between existing institutional scales (stakeholders) and natural scientific knowledge.  It was noted that PICES 
member countries are a rich source of information and data, and are already demonstrating examples of social 
science tool applications for EBFM.  
 
In order to better understand and communicate the societal implications of the conditions and future trends of 
North Pacific marine ecosystems (a vision of the PICES FUTURE (Forecasting and Understanding Trends, 
Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems) program), to provide a forum for the 
integration of FUTURE-related studies using social science approaches and tools, and to facilitate the close 
discussions and communication among researchers from both the natural and social sciences, the Study Group 
recommends forming a new expert group on human dimensions.  This expert group will conduct a survey to 
clarify differences in societal objectives and needs among stakeholders in different sectors and member 
countries and, on this basis, develop an inventory of potential recipients and their communication requirements 
for FUTURE and other PICES products.  By closely coordinating and communicating with other expert groups 
in PICES, it will focus on the responses of human social systems to climate-induced changes in marine 
ecosystems, and will help tune the results from the natural sciences to be relevant (and to resonate with) the 
needs of societies in each PICES member country.  Vulnerability analyses, selection of indicators on the 
human dimensions of EBFM, bioeconomics, and Sato-Umi (village seas) are all potential methods which can 
be applied to these issues.  Based on these results, the expert group will be in a position to contribute to a 
Human Dimensions Chapter in the next Ecosystem Status Report, as well as to organize a symposium on the 
human dimensions of ecosystem-based fisheries management.

1 Introduction 
 
 
The Implementation Plan for the new PICES 
integrative science program on Forecasting and 
Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and Responses 
of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems (FUTURE) 
calls for PICES scientists to make the societal 
implications of their science more explicit and 
accessible through long-term engagement and 
communication among scientists, decision makers, 
stakeholders, and across sectors (PICES, 2009). 
Because different marine sectors view ecosystems in 
terms of their own economic, cultural and societal 
needs, the objective of ecosystem conservation is a 
“societal choice” (Principle 1 of the Ecosystem 
Approach of the Convention on Biological 
Diversity).  Therefore, the social significance of 
predicted impacts from climate or ecosystem 
changes, and the types of information, advice and 
guidance to be requested of FUTURE might differ 
from country to country and sector to sector. Based 
on this understanding, the PICES Science Board 
recommended the formation of the Study Group on 
Human Dimensions (SG-HD), which was 
established in October 2009.  The Study Group 
objective was to review the role of social science 
practices applied in decision-making in marine 
sectors around the world.  In order to fully utilize the 
limited time frame of a Study Group, the main focus 
was on ecosystem-based fisheries management 
(EBFM), with the following terms of reference: 
1. Review how social science has been used/applied 
regionally in EBFM and the theoretical basis for 
these practices; 
2. Review the social scientific tools and information 
available for EBFM in PICES member countries; 
3. Develop an inventory of practices for use of 
social economic information appropriate to the 
circumstances in each of the PICES member 
countries (the term “best practice” is not used 
because it is expected what is “best” will vary 
and be determined according to the circumstances 
in each PICES member country); 
4. Prepare a final report on activities and findings of 
the group and make recommendations on the 
desirability of establishing an expert group 
related to socio-economic sciences within PICES 
and on the role of such group.  For example, 
based on sound social and economic science, the 
potential expert group should first survey/assess 
the needs of potential stakeholders for FUTURE 
products, and scientifically clarify differences in 
societal objectives among stakeholders in different 
sectors and countries.  
 
This is the final SG-HD report.

2 Rationale for Human Dimensions and Social Sciences 
 
 
2.1 Background and Purpose of the Study 
Group on Human Dimensions (SG-HD) 
 
Since the industrial revolution, man’s impact on the 
oceans has increased dramatically, this being 
especially true in recent years.  In nearshore coastal 
areas, human population growth has led to 
increasing pollution and habitat modification. In 
order to tackle this issue, the concept of Ecosystem 
Based Management (EBM) or Ecosystem Approach 
(EA) is now widely accepted as the standard strategy 
for achieving sustainable delivery of marine and 
estuarine ecosystem services (Francis et al., 2011). 
Under the overarching objective of conservation  
of species and habitat, EBM or EA is the 
implementation of defined objectives related to 
maintaining and monitoring biodiversity, productivity, 
and physical and chemical properties of an ecosystem 
(Jamieson and Zhang, 2005).  
 
Under the PICES framework, there were two 
scientific activities associated with this theme.  The 
first one was the Study Group on Ecosystem-based 
Management Science and its Application to the 
North Pacific (SG-EBM, 2003–2004, Co-chairs: 
Glen Jamieson and Chang-Ik Zhang).  The other  
was the Working Group on Ecosystem-based 
Management Science and its Application to the 
North Pacific (WG 19, 2004–2009, Co-chairs:  Glen 
Jamieson, Chang-Ik Zhang, and Patricia Livingston).  
 
The SG-EBM reviewed and described existing and 
anticipated ecosystem-based management initiatives 
in PICES member countries, and found that the 
EBM challenges are different between China, Japan 
and Korea compared with Russia, Canada and the 
United States.  On the western side of the Pacific, 
i.e., China, Japan, and Korea, the much larger 
coastal populations are coupled with their much 
longer history of full exploitation of most 
harvestable renewable resources.  This means that 
EBM is, at the least, focused on:  (1) minimizing 
existing impacts, (2) rebuilding depleted stocks to 
acceptable levels, and (3) in nearshore areas in 
particular, minimizing widespread impacts in the 
marine environment from land runoff from both 
industrial and urban development.  In contrast, in the 
three countries of the North and East Pacific, i.e., 
Russia, Canada and United States, human coastal 
populations and coastal development are generally 
much less, with fishing impacts, offshore oil and gas 
development, and transport identified as the major 
impacts.  In many instances, relatively unimpacted 
pristine habitats and biological communities still 
exist, and so the challenges in these regions often 
concern how to maintain them while permitting 
appropriate new economic activities to occur 
(Jamieson and Zhang, 2005).  
 
Based on these findings, the subsequent Working 
Group (WG 19) developed a country matrix to 
summarize the progress made towards EBM in 
PICES member countries, and found that they used 
very diverse approaches.  WG 19 also found that 
spatial issues were important for identifying 
stakeholders, defining objectives, conducting 
research, and implementing policies. In relation to 
this, the WG 19 final report concluded that 
collaboration with the social sciences is needed to 
develop effective indicators for marine “social-
ecological systems” (Jamieson et al., 2010).  
 
The concept of “social-ecological” systems is a 
relatively new idea.  It recognizes that ecological 
(bio-physical or “natural”) systems and human 
social systems (including cultural, management, 
economic, socio-political, and ethical aspects) are 
sub-systems of larger systems (Berkes and Folke, 
1998; Ostrom 2009; Perry et al., 2010; Ommer et al., 
2011).  This means considering people as more than 
just “stressors” on marine ecosystems through 
fishing, habitat alterations, contaminants, etc. 
Instead, the concept of coupled and integrated social 
and ecological systems needs to be recognized.  
 
Behind the concept of social-ecological systems, 
there exists an emerging recognition that good 
scientific (bio-physical or ecological) arguments for 
PICES Scientific Report No. 39  3 
Rationale for Human Dimensions and Social Sciences  Section 2 
management actions are sometimes not accepted or 
implemented because of the perceived socio-
economic or cultural costs. An integrated 
understanding of how ecosystem changes affect 
human social systems, and vice versa, is necessary 
to improve stewardship of marine ecosystems. 
Similar recognitions have been raised from 
ecosystem modeling studies.  For example, Smith et 
al. (2009) noted that EBM policies and strategies 
that focus only on ecological outcomes are doomed 
to failure.  They concluded that the social sciences 
could contribute at three levels in their simulation 
model, i.e., behavior of individuals, behavior of 
communities and groups, and institutional dynamics 
and governance.  
 
Based on these concepts, the Study Group on 
Human Dimensions (SG-HD) was established in 
2009.  The purpose of SG-HD was not to design 
management systems or plans, and outreach steps, 
but to review the role of social science practices 
applied in decision-making in marine sectors. In 
order to fully utilize the limited time frame of a 
Study Group, the main focus was on ecosystem-
based fisheries management (EBFM, Pikitch et al., 
2004) or Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF, 
Garcia and Cochrane, 2005), in particular in the 
North Pacific.  Also, in order to achieve integrated 
discussions on social-ecological systems, the 
membership included both natural scientists and 
social scientists, as shown in Appendix 8.1.  As 
indicated in the terms of reference in section 1,  
SG-HD reviewed social scientific tools as well as 
their applications in PICES member countries. The 
procedure of the Study Group’s review work is 
provided in Appendix 8.2.  Appendix 8.3 provides a 
summary of a topic session dealing with the 
interactions between natural and socio-economic 
issues in the context of ecosystem-based management, 
and the SG-HD report, from past PICES Annual 
Meetings.  
 
 
2.2 Definition of Terms 
 
In this section, the definitions of terms along with 
the concept of “social-ecological systems” in this 
report are provided. Some of them are very 
customary and common for everyone, but others 
may be different or new, especially for natural 
scientists.  Also, the key words or key concepts in 
each term are provided to highlight the differences 
in the viewpoints among terms. 
Fisheries Management (FM)  
The United Nation’s Food and Agriculture 
Organization’s (FAO) Code of Conduct for 
Responsible Fisheries defines Fisheries Management 
to be the integrated process of information gathering, 
analysis, planning, decision-making, allocation of 
resources and formulation and enforcement of 
fishery regulations by which the FM authority 
controls the present and future behaviors of the 
interested parties in the fishery, in order to ensure 
the continued productivity of the living resources 
(FAO, 1995).  The key concepts or viewpoints in 
this term are fisheries sector, resource (species), and 
productivity in terms of volume and value.  
 
Ecosystem Management (EM)  
Ecologists define Ecosystem Management as 
management driven by explicit goals, executed by 
policies, protocols, and practices, and made 
adaptable by monitoring and research based on our 
best understanding of the ecological interactions and 
processes necessary to sustain ecosystem 
composition, structure, and function (Christensen et 
al., 1996).  It is based on a management philosophy 
which focuses on desired states rather than system 
outputs and which recognizes the need to protect or 
restore critical ecological components, functions, 
and structures in order to sustain resources in 
perpetuity (Cortner et al., 1996).  So, the key 
concepts or viewpoints in this term are native system 
in situ, habitat, and evolutionary and ecological 
processes.  
 
Ecosystem Approach (EA)  
Ecosystem Approach is a strategy for the integrated 
management of land, water, and living resources that 
promotes conservation and sustainable use in an 
equitable way (CBD, 2000).  It is based on the 
application of appropriate scientific methodologies 
focused on levels of biological organization which 
encompass the essential processes, functions, and 
interactions among organisms and their environment. 
It recognizes that people, with their cultural diversity, 
are an integral component of ecosystems.  As the 
operational guidance and 12 principles of EA show 
(http://www.cbd.int/ecosystem/implementation.shtml), 
the key concepts here are, in addition to that of EM, 
benefit-sharing, adaptive strategy, time and scale 
consistency, decentralization, and intersectoral 
cooperation.

PICES Scientific Report No. 39  5 
Ecosystem-based Fisheries Management (EBFM) 
and Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF)  
EBFM is an approach that takes major ecosystem 
components – both structural and functional – into 
account in managing fisheries (NRC, 1999). It 
essentially reverses the order of management 
priorities to start with the ecosystem rather than the 
target species (Pikitch et al., 2004).  On the other 
hand, a similar term, EAF, was adopted by FAO to 
reflect the merger of two different but related 
paradigms, i.e., ecosystem management and fisheries 
management.  There are a lot of terms and acronyms 
related to EBFM or EAF (Garcia et al., 2003; Link 
2010). In this report, SG-HD uses EBFM and EAF 
interchangeably and treats them as synonyms.  Also, 
the Study Group considers EBFM (or EAF) to be an 
extension of conventional fisheries management, so 
that what is managed are not ecosystems but human 
activities. 
 
To clarify the concept of EBFM, Fluharty et al. 
(2010) compared the relationships between FM, 
EBFM, and EM. FM is based on a traditional single-
factor management approach.  It considers only the 
factor or species being used, and physical habitats 
are occasionally considered if they are surrogate for 
population parameters.  On the other hand, EM is an 
integrated management in an ecosystem context, 
which considers impacts of all the activities 
including fisheries on the status of the species being 
used and across the ecosystem.  EM accommodates 
spatial needs and habitat impacts of such activities, 
and considers direct and indirect effects to 
ecosystems, as well as the status of communities and 
resilience of the community or system (Berkes and 
Folke, 1998). Fluharty et al. (2010) positioned 
EBFM between FM and EM. In addition to FM, in 
which the species or factors being used are 
considered, EBFM considers prey, dependent 
predators, food supply and impacts on ecosystems. 
In terms of physical habitats, EBFM considers 
productive capacity and the impacts of fisheries 
activities on habitats.  Also, EBFM pays clear 
attention to environmental conditions such as 
productivity regimes and forcing, as well as 
biodiversity impacts on species which are not being 
used directly by the fisheries sector. The 
fundamental difference between EBFM and EBM is 
that the former considers various impacts from 
fisheries sectors only, while the latter includes all the 
 
other activities and sectors relating to marine 
ecosystem services.  As for the definition of 
“ecosystem”, we follow Jamieson et al. (2010), in 
which an ecosystem is defined as “the spatial unit 
and its organisms and natural processes (and cycles) 
that are being studied or managed.” 
 
Next, we need definitions of terms for the review of 
social scientific tools for EBFM.  
 
Social science  
Social science generally means a group of subjects 
concerned with the study of people within society. In 
this report, however, we focus on the relationships 
between human beings and ecosystems because the 
social-ecological system is one of the key concepts 
in our study.  Therefore, we use the term “social 
science” to mean the group of subjects concerned 
with the relationships among people within society 
as well as among societies and the ecosystems in 
which people spend their lives. 
 
The next section shows the results of the review 
work of SG-HD on social science tools for EBFM in 
various approaches or methodologies.  So, the 
following terms need to be defined: a science tool, a 
scientific approach, and a scientific methodology. 
 
A science tool is a tool, gear, or technique for doing 
scientific work, which can be applied in specified 
ways and purposes.  A scientific approach is a way 
of dealing with scientific themes, a way of doing 
scientific work, or a logical process leading to a 
scientific result.  Usually, a scientific approach uses 
a group of science tools.  A scientific methodology 
is a combination of tools and approaches. A 
scientific discipline is a conventional category of 
training methodologies in educational institutions 
such as universities. 
 
It is easy to understand these definitions if one 
imagines climbing a mountain.  The tools one can 
use are alpenstock, mountain bikes, or cable cars (if 
these exist for the mountain being considered).  The 
approaches one can choose are how to approach the 
summit (objective), i.e., from the north, from the 
south, or via a smooth path, a steep rocky way, etc. 
Each approach needs its appropriate set of tools. 
Some tools can be used in various approaches, while 
others can be used only in a specific approach.

3.1 Social Science Categories and Tools for EBFM 
 
The SG-HD members conducted a thorough review 
of social science categories, and identified useful 
tools for EBFM.  A preceding study on a similar 
theme, (De Young et al., 2008) summarized social 
science tools and methodologies into three 
categories: (1) decision-making tools, (2) information- 
acquisition and dissemination tools, and (3) process 
methodologies. In this report, social science tools 
were categorized into traditional academic 
disciplines.  There are several reasons why SG-HD 
chose to categorize social science tools this way.  
First, the Group wanted to pay attention to the 
specific philosophies or viewpoints developed in 
each traditional discipline, because they will be 
intrinsically reflected in EBFM approaches.  The 
same tools can be used in several disciplines and 
different approaches.  Second, categorization based 
on discipline is easy to understand for most 
university-educated people, and can be referred to 
by professors and lecturers who are going to produce 
future scientists in the field of EBM or EBFM. 
Similarly, when a researcher is going to study new 
tools for EBFM, he/she can easily find the 
candidates for new tools in or near his/her discipline. 
Finally, a discipline-based list of tools can be 
effectively utilized when organizing problem-
solving types of research programs within or across 
research institutes or universities. 
 
The results of SG-HD’s review work are 
summarized in Table 3.1.  It shows the name of 
traditional academic disciplines, their general 
descriptions and typical tools.  These tools can be 
applicable not only to EBFM but also to EBM, i.e., 
analytical objects are not limited to the fisheries 
sector.  As additional information, the table includes 
leading journals in English, from which readers can 
search appropriate research articles on how to use 
the tools for EBFM.  In addition, several non-
English journals published in PICES member 
countries are listed to find more applications in each 
area. 
The disciplines and tools listed in Table 3.1 have the 
potential to improve EBFM by conducting analysis 
based on, for example, the following approaches.  
 
Anthropology, especially cultural anthropology or 
ethnology studies, deals with, among others, cultural 
aspects of the human relationship with ecosystems. 
Its potential contribution to E B F M i s l a r g e .  F o r 
example, many native communities all over the 
world have practiced their own form of EBFM for 
traditional, small-scale, and community-based 
fisheries.  Their management is largely based on 
their traditional view or ecosystem knowledge. 
Anthropology, especially cultural anthropology, can 
reveal their tacit knowledge of ecosystems or 
experiences of fisheries management which have 
accumulated over time.  How people appreciate 
“healthy or desired ecosystems” or “threats”, as well 
as their preferences in food consumption, are also 
deeply rooted in their culture.  
 
Economics generally explores the production, 
distribution, allocation, and consumption of resources 
and services.  Theoretical and empirical analyses can 
be used to address issues from the scale of individual 
households and businesses to the scale of industrial 
sectors, communities, regions, nations, and the 
world.  It can contribute in various ways for better 
EBFM, and SG-HD divided it into six sub- 
categories:  
   bioeconomic modeling,  
   impact analysis,  
   non-market valuation,  
   decision theory,  
   property right regimes,  
   trade/development. 
 
Bioeconomic models can be used to identify socially 
optimum levels of sustainable harvests, to determine 
optimal trajectories for rebuilding depleted 
populations of living marine resources and recovery 
of compromised habitats, and to determine optimal 
size and spacing of marine protected areas.

Anthropology / 
Ethnology   
 
Anthropology, especially cultural (social) anthropology or 
ethnology, covers resources relating to the scientific study 
of human beings, such as their distribution, behavior, 
social and cultural characteristics or development. This 
category, by definition, borrows from related resources in 
history, archaeology, ethnology, folklore and several 
other social sciences. Typical tools in this field are 
participatory observation and evaluation, interviews, 
excursion, surveys/questionnaires, field work, 
comparison, and data analysis.

Economics 
(bioeconomic 
modeling)  
Bioeconomic modeling combines models of the behavior 
and dynamics of biological or ecological systems with 
economic models of the net value of production and 
consumption of goods and services produced by the 
biological or ecological systems. At its simplest, the 
bioeconomic model relies on the biological or ecological 
model to identify the suite of feasible states of the 
biological or ecological system and then uses an 
economic model of market and non-market benefits to 
identify the particular state of the biological or ecological 
system that will maximize value to society as a whole. 
The toolkit for bioeconomic modeling includes:  optimal 
control theory, cost/benefit analysis, and simulations.

Economic impact analysis characterizes the operation of 
regional-scale economies, tracing how changes in the 
economic activity of one sector induce changes in 
spending and employment in other sectors within and 
between regions and through time.  Typical tools are 
input-output analysis, computable general equilibrium

Economics (non-
market valuation) 
Non-market valuation describes the theoretical 
characterization and empirical estimation of the value, 
positive or negative, of goods and services that are not 
transacted in economic markets. Examples of non-market 
goods and services include externalities (e.g., pollution), 
public goods (e.g., scenic vistas, ecosystem services, 
wildlife viewing), and recreation. Tools used in non-
market valuation studies include contingent valuation, 
hedonic pricing, the Travel Cost Method, discrete choice 
models, and economic experiments.

Economics  
(decision theory)  
Decision theory consists of a variety of conceptual and 
applied methods for combining information from diverse 
sources and singular or multiple criteria to identify the 
best decision. Decision theory extends to decision-making 
under uncertainty and in the face of risk as well as 
decision making when faced with cooperative or non-
cooperative opponent (e.g., another firm, another nation, 
or nature).  Tools applied in decision theoretics include: 
problem tree/decision tree analysis, game theory, multi-
attribute utility analysis, Delphi methods, risk analysis, 
analytic hierarchy process, and decision trees.

Economics  
(property right 
regimes)  
The rules that societies use to allocate access to and 
condition the use of living marine resources and their 
environments have a profound influence on the way the 
resources are used, the sustainability of those uses, and on 
the distribution of benefits and costs across society.  
Prevalent property right regimes include, e.g., open 
access, common property, limited entry, individual 
fishing quotas (IFQs), territorial use rights in fishing 
(TURFs), community quotas, sector allocations, and 
fishing cooperatives. 
 
The study of property right regimes, particularly those 
that address the common-pool resource dilemma, is an 
academic focus of resource economists, anthropologists, 
sociologists, lawyers, human ecologists, and game theorists. 
 
The toolkit for evaluation of property right regimes is 
very diverse, running from ethnographies, interviews, and 
surveys to analyses of legal foundations and precedents to 
bioeconomic and decision theoretic models.

Economics (trade 
/ development) 
International trade policies (tariffs and non-tariff barriers, 
exchange rate manipulation, etc.) and international 
economic development activities affect the cost of input 
factors and the value of products, especially when the 
products and their input factors are integrated into 
international trade markets.  
 
Many countries subsidize fisheries production and impose 
trade-distorting tariffs on fish imports or exports. 
Together, these macroeconomic policies influence the 
intensity of fishing pressure and habitat modification. 
Similarly, development policies of donor nations, the UN, 
and the World Bank affect fisheries, through, e.g., loans 
and grants that increase fleet capacity, encourage 
modernization/ industrialization of fishing vessels, and 
encourage development of coastal zone aquaculture.  
The toolkit includes case studies of the macro, micro, and 
regional economic consequences of trade policies and 
economic development programs, theoretical and empirical 
models of international trade, trade liberalization, and 
regional economic cooperation/integration

Section 3  Social Sciences for EBFM 
Theoretical models can be used to derive 
characteristics of optimal solutions; empirical models 
can be used to develop policy recommendations or to 
analyze the consequences of policy choices. 
Bioeconomic models can be specified as dynamic or 
static, stochastic or deterministic, discrete or 
continuous time, single or multispecies.  Empirical 
bioeconomic models often form the core of 
simulation models used to explore the probable 
consequences of policy options or to test the 
sensitivity of the optimal solution(s) to perturbations 
of parameter values. 
 
Economic impact analyses are useful to measure the 
fine scale (economic sector, community, state, or 
country) consequences of management actions (e.g., 
changes in regulations) or changes in external 
drivers (e.g., changes in input or output prices, the 
availability of labor, catch limits, or revised 
allocations between fishing sectors).  Key indicators 
from regional economic models include changes  
in employment, in personal income, and in 
expenditures for inputs.  Regional economic models 
may also provide estimates of economic multipliers 
and measures of economic dependency.  Economic 
multipliers characterize the extent to which 
expenditures within a regional economy stimulate 
additional economic activity.  Economic dependency 
measures attempt to characterize the extent to which 
regional economies are dominated by, and thus 
thrive or collapse, depending on the performance of 
individual economic sectors such as fishing. 
 
Economic markets are efficient (maximize value to 
society) at allocating goods and services when the 
benefits and costs of those goods and services fully 
accrue to market participants. When private 
production and consumption decisions do not reflect 
the full public benefits or costs of the decisions, 
market transactions will lead to overproduction or 
overconsumption of goods and services that generate 
negative externalities, and market transactions will 
lead to the undersupply of goods and services that 
yield valuable public benefits.  Non-market 
valuation is a collection of methods designed to 
estimate the value of goods and services that are not 
well represented in market transactions.  Because 
society benefits (or is harmed) by the production of 
both marketed and non-marketed goods and services, 
it is important that resource managers have access to 
estimates of both when weighing decisions about the 
exploitation or preservation of ecosystems.  
 
It is worth pointing out here that there are important 
discussions going on among experts and researchers 
about the abilities and issues in ecosystem valuations. 
For example, natural ecosystems yield services that 
have intrinsic value for their ability to support 
fisheries and other extractive uses, for their 
contribution to water and atmospheric cycles, for 
their ability to absorb effluents, and for their amenity 
benefits.  In contrast to extractive uses such as 
fisheries, which can be readily monetized, the value 
of many of these other ecosystem services are not 
easily monetized and are often ignored until 
ecosystems are substantially impaired through 
pollution, physical disruption, or eutrophication. 
Societies tend to underinvest in services that are not 
monetized.  Ecosystem valuation has been explored 
through a variety of methodologies (see, e.g., 
Bingham et al., 1995). Examples include assessment 
of the contribution of saltwater marshes, mangroves, 
estuaries, and coral reefs to the reproduction and 
juvenile survival of commercially harvested fish and 
shellfish. Another application of ecosystem 
valuation has been to estimate the avoided cost of 
advanced wastewater treatment if the nearshore 
environment were unable to processes sewage 
discharge – the implication being that society would 
begin to incur the costs of wastewater treatment if 
the marine environment became so impaired that it 
was unable to absorb the sewage discharge. 
Ecosystem value assessment also plays a critical role 
in determining the damages associated with 
pollution events, e.g., cases in Russia (section 4.5) or 
natural disasters, e.g., tsunamis, hurricanes, and 
earthquakes.  In these cases, ecosystem valuation is 
often called “natural resource damage assessment” 
and the lost value of ecosystem services acts as a 
basis for awarding damages against responsible 
parties and compensating those who have lost the 
benefits of unimpaired ecosystem services (see e.g., 
French et al., 1996 and Ward and Duffield, 1992).   
 
The next economic sub-category is decision theory. 
Choices about the goals and objectives of EBFM 
and the means to achieve these goals and objectives 
are complex, uncertain, and controversial.  Decision 
theoretic tools can be used to formalize the process 
of developing the goals and selecting the means, and 
to reveal inconsistencies between the selected means 
and intended outcomes.  These techniques have been 
used to evaluate management strategies for 
transboundary fisheries, and to organize stakeholder 
input on the relative importance of competing 
PICES Scientific Report No. 39  13 
Social Sciences for EBFM  Section 3 
objectives and preferences for alternative 
mechanisms for pursuing those objectives. 
 
The outcome of resource management, whether for 
single species or for ecosystems, is largely 
predetermined by the established rules that govern 
access to, and use of, living marine resources and 
their habitat.  Property right regime studies deal with 
such aspects of EBFM.  They include a group of 
various social sciences, but in this report it is placed 
as a sub-category in economics.  For example, 
solving the common-pool dilemma is the key to 
sustainability.  That many societies have thrived for 
extended periods of time is clear testimony to their 
ability to devise institutions (rules to structure access 
to common resources) that were feasible, 
enforceable, and sustainable.  The litany of collapses 
of marine populations and the ecosystems that 
support them is clear evidence that poorly designed 
or poorly enforced property rights regimes will 
trump any effort at “scientific” management. 
Anthropologists, sociologists, human ecologists, 
resource economists, game theorists, and lawyers 
have learned many lessons about the design features 
of successful solutions to the common-pool dilemma 
and pathologies of unsuccessful resource management 
regimes. These lessons reveal universal principals 
and unique case-specific findings that should prove 
invaluable in the design of EBFM systems. 
 
Trade and development studies have developed their 
own concepts and approaches in economic theory, 
and are the final sub-category. Economic 
development programs and trade policies can work 
in concert with, or in opposition to, the goals and 
objectives of EBFM.  The effect of these policies 
and programs should be considered in the choice of 
management strategies for EBFM.  In addition, the 
implementation of development programs and the 
promulgation of trade policies should take in to 
account EBFM goals and objectives. 
 
By integrating environmental and economic data 
into a coherent framework, environmental accounts 
significantly increase the capacity to evaluate 
economic activity and its dependence upon the 
natural environment as a source of materials and 
energy, and as a sink for waste products.  The 
framework revolves around an integrated information 
system that also provides clear guidance for 
environmental data collection.  In the context of 
fisheries resources, environmental accounting brings 
more systematic organization and coherence to 
scientific and socio-economic datasets through the 
adoption of standard classification, development of 
consistent time series, and enablement of 
international comparisons.  It is an analytical tool for 
fisheries managers, policymakers, and researchers 
alike. 
 
The contributions of geography, especially 
Geographical Information Systems (GIS), have 
already become an indispensable tool for promoting 
EBFM or EAF.  Many case studies have been 
reported in the FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture 
technical paper on “Geographic Information 
Systems to support the ecosystem approach to 
fisheries” (Carocci et al., 2009).  GIS is an important 
tool to integrate data and analytical results from 
wide-ranging disciplines into a visually 
understandable manner, which leads to better 
communication with stakeholders. 
 
Any measures for implementing EBFM must follow 
international and domestic laws.  In other words, 
international and domestic legal components are 
very much in the background of EBFM.  In the 
1970s and 1980s, almost no critical attention was 
paid by legal scholars to these issues with the 
exception of the Regional Fisheries Management 
Organization, and in the Arctic.  Very little work 
was being done except when laws were reauthorized 
or revised, and even then analyses were mostly post-
hoc.  Virtually zero comparative domestic law work 
has been done.  We have to consider legal 
challenges for the integration of marine policy and 
management as well as to adapt to climate change. 
The targets of Domestic Law of the Oceans are 
exclusive economic zones (EEZ), fisheries, marine 
pollution, coastal and marine spatial planning, 
marine transportation, offshore mineral and oil, and 
invasive species. 
 
Also important for implementation is a field called 
policy science.  Policy science for EBFM deals with 
the nature of public policy, its decision-making and 
implementation processes, administrative structure, 
and financial feasibility.  Based on these analyses, 
the roles of government, industry, academics, NGOs, 
consumers, etc., and their appropriate strategies for 
EBFM, can be discussed. 
 
Psychology, especially social psychology, has been 
an indispensable social scientific area for 
understanding many problems concerned with 
fisheries.  Social psychology has a close relationship 
14  PICES Scientific Report No. 39 
Section 3  Social Sciences for EBFM 
to economics (behavioral economics) and often 
involves game theory to explain social phenomena, 
including fisheries.  For example, Hardin’s (1968) 
“tragedy of the commons” is often used to explain 
an overexploitation of the stock which is not 
managed based on “property rights”. The “prisoner’s 
dilemma” (Axelrod, 1984) is also cited for 
explaining an overinvestment in the fishery or 
seafood industry.  A benefit of social psychology is 
that it can explain phenomena which cannot be 
described by general economic theory. Group 
dynamics or social influences are good examples, 
and the understanding of these phenomena is very 
important for not only explaining the activities of 
fishers but also for designing fisheries management 
plans or systems.  Psychology has already played 
important roles in social impact assessments.  
Pollnac et al. (2006) suggested the application of 
this approach to fisheries, especially for assessing 
the satisfaction of stakeholders such as fisheries 
workers and local citizens. 
 
Under EBFM, private companies have been 
increasingly required to conduct ecologically 
sustainable business operations with low 
environmental burdens. At the same time, companies 
must pursue, by definition, profits. The seafood 
business seeks practical business strategies under 
which ecosystems and fisheries can exist in 
productive harmony.  
 
Sociology has many branches and its target spreads 
from the small community level to the global scale. 
EBFM is often merged with an idea of community-
based fisheries management (CBFM) and is known 
as a community-based ecosystem approach to 
fisheries management (CEAFM). Sociology, 
especially community studies, has a very important 
role for analyzing the relationships between small 
communities and their surrounding ecosystems. 
 
Aquaculture, which is fundamentally different from 
the wild capture fisheries, could be one discipline 
applicable and indispensable for EBFM studies.  The 
spatial allocation of sustainable aquaculture sites is 
one important theme in marine planning or EBFM. 
 
 
3.2 The Role of Social Sciences for Better EBFM 
 
Using the approaches and tools summarized in the 
previous section, the social sciences can deal with 
various EBFM issues, which have traditionally not 
been analyzed or discussed in the field of natural 
sciences.  
 
There are many studies or documents which discuss 
the procedures or processes for implementing EBFM 
(e.g., Garcia et al., 2003; Jennings and Rice, 2011), 
but few of them have discussed how to define or 
select the goals, objectives, indicators, or targets. 
Principle 1 of the CBD Ecosystem Approach states 
the objective of ecosystem conservation is a 
“societal choice” (Smith and Maltby, 2003).  We 
clearly need sound social scientific analyses when 
setting or selecting the objectives, goals, indicators, 
or targets for planning and implementing EBFM 
activities.  For example, sound understanding of 
what people care about, or how they appreciate 
ecosystems, is the foundation of such processes (see, 
e.g., the Japanese case study in section 4.2 and Puget 
Sound case study in section 4.6).  Indicators are 
expected to reduce the complexity of ecological 
systems to a small set of synthetic indices of system 
state (Rice and Rochet, 2005).  However, social, 
economic, or institutional indicators for human 
dimensions are less well-developed than for 
ecological indicators.  
 
Many social sciences have developed not only 
qualitative approaches and tools for descriptions, but 
also quantitative analysis approaches and tools for 
numerical verification of the results. Such 
approaches and tools are compatible to natural 
scientific findings or simulation results for EBFM, 
and vice versa.  In that sense, social sciences can 
contribute to judging or assessing the social and 
economic performances of EBFM measures.  In 
particular, many analytical tools have been 
developed in economics and environmental 
accounting to quantitatively assess the “efficiency” 
of specific measures.  In addition, tools in sociology, 
anthropology, and psychology can be used to 
conduct sound analysis on other social criteria such 
as “sufficiency”, “fairness”, and “appropriateness”., 
“Resilience” and “adaptive capacity” are also 
important criteria for assessing EBFM and societal 
responses.  
 
When implementing EBFM measures, the scale 
issue is an important and non-trivial aspect.  Social 
sciences can propose spatial, temporal, and 
organizational scales for EBFM, coordinate with 
existing institutional scales and stakeholders, and 
provide natural scientific knowledge.  Because some 
socio-economic information is easier for stakeholders 
PICES Scientific Report No. 39  15 
Social Sciences for EBFM  Section 3 
16  PICES Scientific Report No. 39 
to understand than the natural scientific type and 
therefore, is more useful to explain, the social 
sciences can promote natural scientific understanding 
to stakeholders. Overall, by conducting these analyses, 
the social sciences can improve the value of the 
information produced by natural sciences for better 
understanding by the public, administrative officials 
and fishers.

4 Application of Social Sciences for EBFM in PICES Member 
Countries 
 
 
In this section, three examples of the application of 
social sciences are introduced for each PICES 
member country.  A summary of 18 case studies is 
shown in Table 4.1.  Note that these are just typical 
examples from the growing number of experiences 
in the member countries, and not a comprehensive 
catalogue of applications.  Many other application 
cases can be found in the journals listed in Table 3.1. 
 
 
4.1 Canada 
 
Environmental accounting framework in Canada  
As the nation-wide initiative for developing EBFM, 
environmental accounting concepts are being 
applied to monitor and assess the economic 
importance, impacts, full costs, and benefits of 
fisheries management.  It is composed of the asset 
accounts (economic value of stocks of human-made 
capital, i.e., fishing fleets/vessels, fish processing 
capacity), flow accounts (employment in fisheries 
sectors, dependencies on fishing and related 
activities) and economic impacts of marine-related 
activities in Canada.  The environmental accounting 
framework will also find enhanced applications in 
more recent efforts towards the development of an 
ecosystem goods and services framework (Statistics 
Canada, 2006).  Several typical examples of 
empirical estimates are as follows:  
 
1. Material and energy flow accounts: record, in 
physical terms, the flow of materials and energy 
– in the form of natural resources and wastes – 
between the economy and the environment.  
They are directly linked to the input–output 
accounts of the Canadian System of National 
Accounts (CSNA).  This linkage enables the 
calculation of key indicators of the resource and 
waste intensity of economic activity.  
2. Natural resource stock accounts: measure 
quantities of natural resource stocks (oil, natural 
gas, minerals, timber, and land) and the annual 
changes in these stocks due to natural processes 
and human activity.  These accounts, which are 
recorded using both physical and monetary units, 
form the basis of the estimates of Canada’s 
natural resource wealth that are included in the 
Canadian national balance sheet accounts.  
3. Measuring renewable water assets in Canada: 
Empirical work on environmental accounting of 
fisheries and other aquatic resources is not yet 
fully implemented in Canada. 
 
Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area 
The Pacific North Coast Integrated Management 
Area (PNCIMA) is the coastal area facing the U.S. 
border at Alaska in the north, the base of the 
continental shelf in the west, Brooks Peninsula in the 
southwest, and the point of separation of Johnstone 
Strait and Strait of Georgia in the southwest.  Its 
ecosystem management goal is to ensure a healthy 
and prosperous ocean area by working with all 
interested parties to develop and implement a plan to 
manage human activities in a comprehensive manner 
that balances ecological, economic, social, and 
cultural interests.  The governing body includes a 
wide range of representatives from federal (e.g., 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), Environment 
Canada, Natural Resources Canada, Transport 
Canada), and provincial (British Columbia and 
regional districts) governments, and First Nations 
organizations (Nanwakolas Council of First Nations, 
Council of the Haida Nation, Central Coast First 
Nations Committee, North Coast Skeena First 
Nations Stewardship Society, etc.).  The PNCIMA 
Initiative is now preparing an integrated management 
plan.  In order to develop the conservation objectives 
for the area, Marine Use Analyses are being 
conducted, which include tools from anthropology 
(how communities use this marine environment), 
economics (analyses of monetary and on-monetary 
economic values), and policy issues (legal analysis 
and policy science).

Marine protected areas in British Columbia 
The first marine waters in British Columbia were 
protected in 1911 as part of Strathcona Provincial 
Park. Since that time, over 100 other marine protected 
areas (MPAs) have been designated. Recently, a 
Marine Protected Areas Implementation Team 
(MPAIT) has been formed, with participation by both 
federal (DFO, Parks Canada) and provincial (Lands 
and Forests, Environment) governments. There are 
two panels that provide biological/physical and socio-
economic advice for MPA design. The socio-
economic team is proposing to use tools in 
anthropology, economics, aquaculture siting and their 
ecological and economic interactions, legal issues 
(e.g., issues of native rights and title) to evaluate the 
human aspects of locations being considered as 
protected areas.  Also, based on GIS analysis, 
cumulative human impacts (including fisheries) and 
their spatial characteristics in the ecosystem, are being 
analyzed (Ban et al., 2010). 
 
 
4.2 Japan 
 
Social survey on public demands for ocean policy 
In 2007, the Basic Act on Ocean Policy was enacted 
to clarify the principles of ocean policy in Japan, 
covering all the marine-related industries, including 
fisheries.  The six basic principles set down in this 
Act are:  
1. harmonization of the development and use of the 
oceans in ways that conserve the marine 
environment, 
2. ensuring safety and security on the oceans,  
3. improvement of scientific knowledge of the oceans, 
4. sound development of ocean industries,  
5. comprehensive governance of the oceans, and  
6. international partnership with regard to the oceans 
(Makino, 2011).  
 
Based on this Act, the Headquarters for Ocean Policy, 
headed by the Prime Minister of Japan, was 
established in the Cabinet, and the Basic Plan on 
Ocean Policy was formulated in 2008.  This Basic 
Plan prescribes in more detail the direction of ocean 
policy in Japan.  In accordance with it, the Fisheries 
Research Agency (FRA) identified five objectives of 
Japanese fisheries management (resource and 
ecosystem conservation; seafood provision; industrial 
and economic development; local and community 
development; cultural and scientific promotion) by 
Delphi methods. FRA also conducted a web-based 
survey to gain insight into public demand for policies. 
The questionnaire asked the respondents to choose 
what they thought were the important usages of the 
waters around Japan (the total number of results 
analyzed was 2000, with a maximum of two choices). 
Of all respondents, 83.3% chose “food production by 
fisheries,” followed by “generation of energy from 
tidal power or offshore wind power” (54.4%), 
“transportation” (21.0%), “recreational use” (8.2%), 
and “creation of space by land reclamation” (1.9%). 
The respondents who chose “food production by 
fisheries” were the largest group in every region, and 
the higher the age bracket, the greater number of such 
respondents (FRA, 2009). 
 
Shiretoko World Natural Heritage Area 
The Shiretoko Peninsula, in northeastern Hokkaido, is 
the southernmost seasonal limit of sea ice in the 
Northern Hemisphere.  This region is characterized by 
closely linked terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and 
by a number of marine and terrestrial species, 
including several endangered ones.  In 1964, the 
Shiretoko Peninsula and its surrounding marine areas 
were designated a National Park, and added to the 
UNESCO World Heritage List in July 2005.  In order 
to propose necessary policy measures and to evaluate 
the efficiency of EBM measures, an institutional 
analysis was conducted to identify the gap between 
the existing fisheries management framework and 
EBM.  A cost-benefit analysis showed that the costs 
for EBM measures correspond to 0.8% of the sum of 
the production by two major industries in the area, i.e., 
fisheries and tourism (Makino et al., 2009). 
 
Sato-Umi in Okinawa 
Sato-Umi (meaning “village seas” in Japanese) is 
defined as the coastal sea that has high productivity 
and biodiversity with human actions (Yanagi, 2006). 
To achieve it, a big, long, smooth material circulation 
is needed by implementing environmental 
conservation from mountain to sea, and marine living 
resource conservation from the context of the food 
chain and ecosystems.  The Sato-Umi concept is 
composed of the combination of biological/ecological 
systems in the coastal sea, and the historical/cultural/ 
socio-economic systems in the coastal land.  Tools in 
anthropology and sociology are applied to understand 
historical processes, culture, and economics.  Several 
non-market valuation analyses were conducted for 
coral reef Sato-Umi areas in Okinawa.  In 2008, the 
Ministry of Environment started the Sato-Umi 
Creation Support Project, and seven cases have been 
designated as models for the Sato-Umi approach 
(Hirota, 2010).

Institutional analysis for EBFM 
The term ecosystem-based fisheries management is 
neither a new concept nor a new idea for most 
Chinese scholars engaged in fisheries management 
studies.  For example, Chinese Fisheries Economics, a 
professional journal for Chinese scholars specialized 
in the field of fisheries economics and management, 
published a paper entitled “The Theoretical Research 
about the Ecosystem-based Fishery Management” in 
2006.  It gave a detailed explanation about what 
EBFM is, why EBFM is proposed, what principles 
should be followed when EBFM is implemented, and 
how the existing management system should be 
modified if China aims to transform to EBFM.  Chen 
(2010) summarized the major institutional 
frameworks and activities for EBFM in China, 
following seven questions about the introduction of 
EBFM:  
1. political willingness (strong at city level, moderate 
at provincial level, weak at the central level),  
2. financial budget (more at the central level, 
moderate at provincial level, less at city level),  
3. scientific support (not enough),  
4. institutional background for EBFM action (not 
ready),  
5. enforcement (generally weak),  
6. right spatial-scale for EBFM,  
7. successful case studies (do not yet exist).  
 
Also, in order to identify the gap between existing 
fisheries management frameworks and EBFM, and to 
propose the necessary road map for better 
management with a catch quota system, institutional 
analyses based on property right regimes and policy 
circle theory have been conducted (Mu and Liang, 
2010). 
 
Non-market valuation for the Yellow Sea, South China 
Sea, East China Sea, and Bohai Sea 
Non-market valuation tools are intensively utilized in 
China (e.g., Liu et al., 2008).  In addition, a software 
program named MEGA-MES (Marine EcoloGical 
Assessment Group-Marine Ecosystem Service 
Valuation Software), which is based on non-market 
valuation tools and the results from bio-physical 
analyses, was developed for evaluating food 
production, material production, oxygen production, 
climate regulation, waste treatment, recreational 
service, scientific service, and species diversity 
maintenance. (Chen et al., 2006). MEGA-MES has 
been applied to the Yellow Sea, South China Sea, 
East China Sea, Bohai Sea. 
 
Aquaculture site selection 
GIS analysis was conducted in order to determine the 
recommended domains (places where certain target 
production systems and technologies may be feasible 
for introduction and adoption by farmers) for 
promoting freshwater aquaculture development aimed 
at helping to improve household food security and 
livelihoods of smallhold farmers (Yang, 2007).  In 
this analysis, wide-ranging approaches and tools, from 
both social sciences and natural sciences, were 
integrated using GIS. For example, results from bio-
physical analyses on the environmental factors that 
determine the potential for a certain technology, and 
the results from socio-economic analysis and policy 
factors that affect sustained adoption of the 
technology, were integrated using GIS.  Also, the 
cultural background and infrastructure were 
considered as the enabling institutions for aquaculture. 
 
 
4.4 Republic of Korea 
 
Risk analysis for the large purse seine fishery 
Integrated Fisheries Risk Assessment, Forecasting and 
Management for Ecosystems (IFRAME) is a 
comprehensive risk analysis model for EBFM (Zhang 
et al., 2009).  It is composed of four attributes: 
sustainability, biodiversity, habitat, and socio-
economics, including indicators for each attribute.  As 
a socio-economic attribute, four indicators are 
developed, such as economic production, revenue/ 
income, market, and employment.  They evaluate the 
change of socio-economic effects together with other 
attributes.  In the future, more consideration on 
developing effective indicators is needed.  If they are 
developed by collecting necessary data, they will 
provide useful information for the evaluation of 
fisheries management measures.  As a case study, 
IFRAME was applied to the Korean large purse seine 
fishery to assess the effects of the climate change, 
such as economic revenue, seafood market, and 
employment as well as the ecological analysis on 
biomass, trophic level, and bycatch.  The results 
suggested that the level of fishing mortality should be 
reduced by about 25% to adapt stably and effectively 
to future changes in climate (Kim and Zhang, 2011).
  
PICES Scientific Report No. 39  21

Economic effects of the fry release program 
The fry release program has operated in Korea since 
1976.  It was implemented in order to complement and 
enhance the recruitment of insufficient fishery 
resources by releasing fry to increase catch limits, to 
increase the income of small-scale fishermen in coastal 
fisheries, and to promote the vitalization of fishing 
villages.  Records of the fry release program show that 
the total number of released fish between 2004 and 
2007 was about 400 million and the types of released 
fish included giant prawn, flatfish (Oliver flounder), 
abalone, and rockfish. The program continues to 
expand and is expected to grow with the necessity of 
fish stock recovery.  In order to evaluate the economic 
effects of the fry release program, various economic 
tools such as net present value, cost-benefit ratio, and 
internal rate of return were applied for Oliver flounder. 
Also, the increases in public welfare (cultural service) 
were estimated by non-market valuation tools such as 
travel cost methods, random utility models, and 
contingent valuation methods. 
 
Stock rebuilding plan for sandfish 
In Korea, a fish stock rebuilding plan (FSRP), 
combined with conventional fish stock enhancement 
programs, was established in 2005 (Lee, 2010). 
Sandfish (Arctoscopus japonicus) was selected as a 
target species for the rebuilding plan in 2006. 
Sandfish was chosen because of the large reduction in 
catch that resulted from overfishing of adult sandfish, 
reckless fishing of fingerlings and destruction of 
spawning grounds.  Sandfish is caught in many 
fisheries including the gill-net fishery and trawl 
fishery, but is mainly done by the Danish seine fishery 
and coastal gill-net fishery.  A rebuilding period was 
set as 10 years, with target catch determined for each 
year.  Target catches were initially set at 2,600 tons 
for 2006, 3,700 tons for 2007 and 5,000 tons for 2015.  
Using a bioeconomic modeling technique based on 
stock investigation and evaluation results, target stock 
accomplishments during the rebuilding period and 
economic effects were analyzed. Four policy 
alternatives were analyzed to estimate the change in 
sandfish stock for the next 25 years, and change in 
profit of target fisheries (Kim, 2009). 
 
 
4.5 Russia 
 
Ecosystem service values in the Kamchatka region  
In order to evaluate the total value of marine natural 
capital (water biological resources, oil and gas 
resources, and hydro-energetic resources) and 
ecosystem services, non-market valuation tools were 
applied (Shirkov, et al., 2006).  The results suggested 
that the value of non-market ecosystem services was 
higher than the benefit from oil and gas exploitation. 
  
Assessment of economic losses from marine pollution 
and water engineering at Sakhalin Island  
A lot of funds were invested by Russia and foreign 
countries to the economy of the Sakhalin region in 
2000–2004.  In this period, per capita income 
increased 1,5 percent per month.  However, because 
of rapid development in oil exploitation, a lot of 
damage occurred in the fisheries sector.  Income from 
oil exploration is not the reason for fishery ignorance 
in this region. Synyakov et al. (2006) estimated the 
total economic damage to fish incurred from marine 
pollution and water engineering in oil processing on 
northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island at US$15 
million in 2000–2009. This means economic losses 
were larger than the economic investment in the 
region.  
 
Assessment of ecosystem service values and economic 
losses in Primorsky Kray  
Ecosystem service values in Peter the Great Bay 
(south coast of Primorsky Kray) were estimated in 
2009.The cost of biological resources (fish, marine 
invertebrates, seaweeds) was only 10% of the total 
value of ecosystem services of the Bay (Lukyanova et 
al., 2010a).  On the other hand, economic losses in the 
fisheries sector incurred from water engineering 
(construction of bridges, etc.) on the coast and the 
rivers on the territory of Primorsky Kray amounted to 
about US$300,000 in 2009–2010  (Lukyanova et al., 
2010b).

Environmental Assessment  
The Environmental Assessment system of the U.S. 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires 
federal agencies to document the problem to be 
addressed by the proposed actions, to identify the 
alternatives to be considered, to describe the affected 
environment, and to analyze the alternatives.  Many 
social and economic factors such as public 
participation, technical and allocative efficiencies, and 
regional impacts are included in this assessment 
process.  For example, when the government is going 
to introduce a fisheries management measure that 
22  PICES Scientific Report No. 39 
Section 4  Application of social sciences for EBFM 
PICES Scientific Report No. 39  23 
needs to be addressed by the Environmental 
Assessment, participation by fishers, processors, and 
crews will be analyzed using tools in sociology, 
geography, etc.  Also, using the tools in economics 
and area studies, tax revenues or regional impacts for 
local communities are analyzed.  For consumers, 
product quality and availability are considered based 
on the tools in seafood business.  
 
Fisheries management in Alaska 
The North Pacific Fishery Management Council 
(NPFMC) has implemented six Fisheries 
Management Plans (FMPs): the Bering Sea and 
Aleutian Islands (BSAI) groundfish FMP, Gulf of 
Alaska (GOA) groundfish FMP, the Arctic 
Management Area FMP, the BSAI crab FMP, the 
scallop FMP, and the salmon FMP.  These FMPs 
govern the setting of annual catch limits, restrict 
fishing practices relating to gear, bycatch and discard 
requirements, administer the allocation of fishery 
privileges among fishers, and constrain spatial and 
temporal access to fishery resources.  Annual stock 
assessment and fishery evaluation (SAFE) is the base 
of such management measures. It includes not only 
bio-physical analyses but also the social and 
economic impacts analysis.  For example, the social 
and economic HYPERLINK “E:\\from” shares 
market-based consolidation, fleet composition, 
distribution and abundance trends in the human 
population.  Also, when prohibition on the retention 
of forage fish is specified by FMPs, economic 
analysis such as opportunity costs, monitoring and 
enforcement costs, and impacts on small entities are 
considered (Criddle, 2010).  
 
Puget Sound Partnership 
The Puget Sound Partnership (PSP) is a community 
effort of citizens, governments, tribes, scientists and 
businesses working together to restore and protect 
Puget Sound.  PSP is a coordinating agency, not a 
regulatory agency.  It coordinates federal, state, local 
tribal and private resources, and makes sure that all 
are working cooperatively.  Its goal is to make Puget 
Sound healthy again, and to create a roadmap for how 
to get it done.  PSP is designated as the lead entity for 
integrating estuary and watershed protection programs 
for Puget Sound under the National Estuary Program 
(U.S. Clean Water Act sec. 320).  The Science Panel, 
which is the scientific advisory body of PSP, has 
adopted Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) as a 
central organizing tool.  It offers a means to model 
and test linkages among ecosystem threats, 
management activities, and environmental and 
social/economic goals (Levin et al., 2009).  Elements 
of the IEA include:  
1. refining ecosystem goals and objectives,  
2. conducting risk analyses,  
3. developing and evaluating policy strategies, and  
4. monitoring ecosystem status and effectiveness of 
actions (Puget Sound Partnership, 2010).  
As base information to set a definition of a healthy 
ecosystem, to identify threats, and to prioritize various 
indicators, a cognitive study was conducted on local 
stakeholders to grasp their recognition of the values 
and states of Puget Sound.  Results are to be applied 
to the Integrated Ecosystem Assessment models 
(Fluharty, 2010).

5 Discussion  
 
 
Table 4.1 shows that wide-ranging social science 
approaches and tools have been, or are being, 
introduced in a variety of locations and scales in 
PICES member countries.  In reality, most of the 
major social science approaches and tools listed in 
Table 3.1 have been already introduced or are being 
introduced in the member countries.  This fact 
strongly implies that each member country has a rich 
source of experienced researchers for the analysis of 
human dimensions.  In other words, once an expert 
group of social scientists from the member countries 
is formed under the PICES framework, it can conduct 
high-level and comprehensive studies on human 
dimensions for EBFM in the North Pacific.  Such an 
expert group would contribute significantly to the 
value of the PICES integrative science program 
FUTURE (Forecasting and Understanding Trends, 
Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific Marine 
Ecosystems) to improve the applications to, and 
understanding by, stakeholders. 
 
It should be noted that, as the terms of reference for 
SG-HD clearly addresses, different marine sectors 
view ecosystems in terms of their own economic, 
cultural and societal needs.  Therefore, the social 
significance of predicted impacts from climate or 
ecosystem changes, and the types of information, 
advice and guidance to be requested of FUTURE 
might differ from country to country and sector to 
sector.  Based on sound social science approaches and 
tools introduced in this report, an important next step 
is to survey/assess the needs of potential stakeholders 
for FUTURE products, and scientifically clarify 
differences in societal objectives and needs among 
stakeholders in different sectors and member 
countries.  
 
Spatial-scale issues are another challenge for social 
science analysis.  Many application cases listed in 
Table 4.1 are basically at the local scale.  With a close 
relationship to the bio-physical products from 
FUTURE, it might be worth trying to discuss the 
possibility of applying social science tools at larger 
marine ecosystem scales.  
 
Another, but not less, important challenge for the 
social sciences is to conduct research (or Topic 
Sessions) which fit the FUTURE perspectives.  For 
example, the social system’s response to climate 
change and uncertainties (vulnerability analysis, 
indicators of the human dimensions, etc.) could be the 
candidates for such analyses.  
 
 
 
 
PICES Scientific Report No. 39  25 
 
   
Section 6  Recommendations 
 
 
 
 
6 Recommendations 
 
 
Members of SG-HD had intensive discussions on 
how the findings and work of this report could best 
be integrated and built upon within PICES in the 
years ahead, particularly within the context of the 
PICES FUTURE program.  One of the most 
important differences between FUTURE and its 
predecessor, the PICES/GLOBEC Climate Change 
and Carrying Capacity (CCCC) program is that 
FUTURE is placing greater emphasis on societal 
concerns that arise from changes in North Pacific 
marine ecosystems (PICES, 2008).  Taking this into 
account, the findings and work of SG-HD can make 
significant contributions both to FUTURE and to the 
activities of the PICES standing committees, in 
particular, the Fishery Science Committee and Marine 
Environmental Quality Committee, as described 
below. 
 
The FUTURE Science Plan (PICES, 2008) sets the 
Third Research Theme as “How do human activities 
affect coastal ecosystems and how are societies 
affected by changes in these ecosystems?”  More 
precisely, a full exploration of Key Question 3.4 
“What will be the consequences of projected coastal 
ecosystem changes and what is the predictability and 
uncertainty of forecasted changes?” should include 
an assessment of the potential social consequences 
caused by the ecosystem changes such as decreases 
in fisheries incomes, distribution of wealth among 
sectors or areas, and influences on demographic 
profiles of coastal communities.  The social sciences 
have a wide range of analytical tools (quantitative 
and qualitative) which can be applicable for this 
purpose, as described in section 3.1 of this report.  
 
Also, the FUTURE Key Question 3.5 “How can we 
effectively use our understanding of coastal 
ecosystem processes and mechanisms to identify the 
nature and causes of ecosystem changes and to 
develop strategies for sustainable use?” requires 
objective and technical information for developing 
coping, adaptation and mitigation strategies (note 
that PICES is not a policy organization).  In this 
regard, the social sciences can support the setting of 
management objectives by evaluating the likely 
social and economic consequences of alternative 
management actions, assessing priorities among 
issues, and identifying socio-economic indices 
related to the state of fisheries and ecosystems.  One 
of the major issues in developing coping strategies is 
the multiplicity of scales (spatial, temporal, and 
organizational) at which the social and ecological 
systems interact.  The social sciences can contribute 
analytical tools for better coordination between 
existing institutional scales (stakeholders) and 
natural scientific knowledge.  
 
FUTURE seeks to increase awareness of the 
ecological and societal importance of the North 
Pacific within PICES member countries (PICES, 
2009).  The FUTURE Implementation Plan sets 
Objective 2 as the production of status reports, 
outlooks, forecasts, and engagement potential users 
(community, industry, government, international 
organization) on issues relating to North Pacific 
ecosystems and climate.  The social sciences are 
uniquely positioned to contribute to efforts on 
engagement.  It should be noted though, that because 
different regions or sectors view ecosystems in terms 
of their own economic, cultural and societal needs, 
the communication requirements are different, and 
therefore the information provided by PICES should 
be tailored differently.  
 
There are several other international research 
activities with common interests and objectives. For 
example, one of the Key Questions in the Science 
Plan for the ICES Strategic Initiative on Climate 
Change Effects on Marine Ecosystems is “How will 
societies that depend on ecosystems services 
respond to climate-driven changes in ecosystem 
services, and which responses are consistent with an 
ecosystem approach to management?”. The 
Integrated Marine Biogeochemistry and Ecosystem 
Research (IMBER, a core project of the 
International Geosphere–Biosphere Programme, 
IGBP) Human Dimensions Working Group is 
focusing its activities on the multiple feedbacks 
PICES Scientific Report No. 39  27 
Recommendations  Section 6 
between human and ocean systems.  The objective 
of the Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone 
(LOICZ; also an IGBP core project) includes 
developing and testing integrated multidisciplinary 
(natural + economic + social) methods to analyze the 
environmental and social interactions and feedbacks 
governing coastal system status and changes. PICES 
needs to interact with these groups to facilitate 
academic communication and discussions on marine 
issues. 
 
Taking all of the above into account, SG-HD 
recommends that PICES establish a new expert 
group (potentially a “Section”) related to the social 
sciences.  Recognizing the longer-term requirement 
of the activities of this group (i.e., longer than the 
usual 3-year duration of PICES Working Groups), 
SG-HD recommends this expert group be 
established for the entire duration of the PICES 
FUTURE program (contingent upon adequate 
performance, for example, the practice for PICES 
Sections to be reviewed every 3 years) and that it be 
placed under, and report to, Science Board.  As 
Table 3.1 shows, the social sciences are composed 
of several wide-ranging disciplines.  Therefore, it is 
desirable that at least three members with balanced 
specialties from the social sciences and natural 
sciences should represent each member country. The 
following is a draft proposal for the expert group. 
 
Objective 
 
To better understand and communicate the societal 
implications of the conditions and future trends of 
North Pacific marine ecosystems (a vision of the 
PICES FUTURE program), to provide a forum for 
the integration of FUTURE-related studies using 
social science approaches and tools, and to facilitate 
the close discussions and communications among 
researchers from both the natural and social sciences. 
 
Draft Terms of Reference 
 
The Section on Human Dimensions of Marine 
Systems (S-HD) is the scientific body responsible for 
the promotion, coordination, integration and 
synthesis of research activities related to the 
contribution of the social sciences to FUTURE, to 
PICES Scientific Committees, and to PICES as an 
organization.  
1. S-HD will work towards scientific clarification of 
differences in societal objectives and needs 
among stakeholders in different sectors and 
countries. Based on that result, S-HD will 
develop an inventory of potential recipients, and 
their communication requirements for FUTURE 
and other PICES products, such as the state of the 
ocean reports (FUTURE Objective 2). 
2. Based in part on the results of TOR 1, and with 
close coordination and communication with 
SOFE-AP and other expert groups within PICES, 
S-HD will scientifically explore the 
consequences to and responses of human social 
systems to climate-induced changes in marine 
ecosystems (FUTURE key question 3.4).  Social 
science tools summarized in Table 3.1 of this 
report will be applied to such an analysis. 
3. S-HD will contribute a Human Dimension 
Chapter to the next Ecosystem Status Report 
(FUTURE Objective 2). 
4. S-HD will facilitate academic cooperation with 
other international research activities such as 
ICES, IMBER, LOICZ, etc., and organize a 
symposium on the study of the human 
dimensions of marine ecosystems. 
 
 
Membership 
 
We recommend a membership that will ensure core 
connection with PICES Committees, key expertise 
from the various social and natural science 
disciplines, and national representation. We 
advocate a nomination process that closely connects 
this group to PICES Scientific Committees through, 
for example, ensuring that at least one member or 
designate be drawn from each Committee.  The 
membership for the new Section should include:  
(1) at least some individuals who participated in  
SG-HD and (2) experts from the various natural and 
social science (economy, geography, sociology, 
anthropology, etc.) disciplines.

SUMMARY OF SCIENTIFIC SESSIONS AND WORKSHOPS 
 
 
MEQ Topic Session (S12) 
Connecting the human and natural dimensions of marine ecosystems and marine management in the 
PICES context  
 
Co-Convenors:  David L. Fluharty (USA), Mitsutaka Makino (Japan), R. Ian Perry (Canada) and Chang-Ik 
Zhang (Korea) 
 
 
Background  
 
A complete definition of marine ecosystems includes the human components. Consideration of ecosystem-
based management, at least within the natural sciences, usually leaves out the human dimensions, or includes it 
only as fishing effort. For ecosystem-based management to succeed, however, humans need to be included. 
This session builds on the Science Board Symposium of 2003 titled “Human dimensions of ecosystem 
variability”.  Human relationships and how humans interact with the ocean have been changing in nature and 
strength over time. Natural variability in marine systems can be large, but so are socio-economic pressures and 
considerations relating to marine environments.  Determining appropriate socio-economic indicators to 
complement indicators of natural climate variability, e.g. for ecosystem-based management, is an ongoing 
challenge.  This session will address these interactions between natural and socio-economic issues in the 
context of ecosystem-based management.  Specifically, it will consider:  (1) What are the criteria to determine 
relevant socio-economic indicators of human well-being related to marine issues for PICES member countries? 
(2) What are appropriate indicators to monitor changes in management objectives and human well-being 
relevant to changing ecosystem structure and production? (3) How might decisions that are made to enhance 
human well-being likely to impact (positively or negatively) the nature and functions of marine ecosystems? 
This session theme will continue to explore the many ways that humans interact with marine ecosystems and 
the scientific efforts to quantify and predict human impacts on the dynamics of such systems.  
 
Summary of presentations 
 
Ten oral (including 1 invited) and 13 posters were presented in this session.  After the introduction of this 
session from Mr. Fluharty (U.S.A) on behalf of the co-convenors, Dr. Makino reviewed the social and 
ecological conditions of fisheries with respect to management strategies.  Then, Dr. Hamilton (Invited, 
University of New Hampshire, U.S.A.) presented the relationships between ecosystems, fisheries and social 
changes in western Alaska.  Dr. Zhang reviewed the socio-economic indicators used in ecosystem-based 
assessments for the Eastern Bering Sea trawl fishery.  After the introduction of environmental contaminants in 
Pacific food webs and their implications for coastal First Nations by Dr. Ross, Dr. Fluharty talked about the 
use of social science information in marine management processes in the U.S.A.  Four more studies were then 
presented from Korea (by Dr. Park), China (Dr. Chen and Dr. Zhang), and Russia (Dr. Lukyanova). Dr. Pooley 
reported the results of a related symposium, convened by GLOBEC and co-sponsored by PICES, which was 
held at FAO headquarters in July 2008, and which was convened by Dr. Perry.  The session concluded that we 
should continue to explore the many ways that humans interact with marine ecosystems and the scientific 
efforts to quantify and predict human impacts on the dynamics of such systems.

PICES Nineteenth Annual Meeting

2010 REPORT OF THE STUDY GROUP ON HUMAN DIMENSIONS 
 
 
Background and Terms of Reference 
 
The Implementation Plan for the new PICES integrative science program on Forecasting and Understanding 
Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems” (FUTURE) calls for PICES 
scientists to make the societal implications of their science more explicit and accessible through long-term 
engagement and communication activities among scientists, decision makers, stakeholders, and across sectors.  
Because different marine sectors view ecosystems in terms of their own economic, cultural and societal needs, 
the objective of ecosystem conservation is “a societal choice” (Principle 1 of the Ecosystem Approach of the 
Convention on Biological Diversity).  Therefore, the social significance of predicted impacts from climate or 
ecosystem changes, and the types of information, advice and guidance to be requested of FUTURE might 
differ from country to country and sector to sector. 
 
The objective of the Study Group on Human Dimensions (SG-HD), established at PICES-2009 in Jeju, Korea,  
under the direction of Science Board (Decision 09/S7/(iii)), is not to design management systems or plans, and 
outreach steps, but to review the role of social sciences practices applied in decision-making in marine sectors 
around the world.  In order to fully utilize the limited time frame of the Study Group (one year), the main focus 
will be on ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). 
 
The Study Group intends to: 
   Review how social science has been used/applied globally and regionally in EBFM, and the theoretical 
basis for these practices; 
   Review the social scientific tools and information available for EBFM in PICES member countries; 
   Develop an inventory of practices for use of social economic information appropriate to the circumstances 
in each PICES member country (the term “best practice” is not used because it is expected that what is 
considered “best” will vary and be determined according to the circumstances in each of PICES member 
country); 
   Prepare a final report on activities and findings of the Group and make recommendations on the 
desirability of establishing an expert group related to socio-economic sciences within PICES, and on the 
role of such a group.  For example, based on sound social and economic science, the potential expert group 
should first survey/assess the needs of potential stakeholders for FUTURE products, and scientifically 
clarify differences in societal objectives among stakeholders in different sectors and member countries. 
 
The approved membership of the Study Group can be found in SG-HD Endnote 1. 
 
 
Study Group process 
 
SG-HD completed, or will complete, the following tasks, as described in the seven steps shown below.    
 
<Step 1>  April 15, 2010:  A draft table of categories and tools in social sciences was made. 
<Step 2> June 23, 2010:  Each Study Group member reviewed applications/experiences of social science 
tools for EBFM in his/her country. 
38  PICES Scientific Report No. 39 
Section 8  Appendices 
<Step 3> June 24–25, 2010:  An inter-sessional meeting was held in Yokohama, Japan, to review results of 
each member country’s applications/experiences.  Based on the results, a table of categories in 
social science disciplines and their tools was finalized.  
<Step 4> End of August 2010:  The review scope was expanded to other social science disciplines. Based 
on the results from the Yokohama meeting, the Chairman proposed that each Study Group 
member conduct a review on his/her specialty, and make a brief report. 
<Step 5> Beginning of October 2010:  A draft of the final report (review of results, inventory of practices, 
and recommendations) was circulated by the Chairman to the Study Group. 
<Step 6> October 22, 2010:  The final SG-HD meeting was held at PICES-2010 in Portland, U.S.A., to 
finalize the contents of the report. 
<Step 7> April 2011:  A draft of the SG-HD final report will be presented at the inter-sessional Science 
Board meeting in Honolulu.  The draft will then be circulated to other specialists and expert 
groups in PICES, and submitted to the PICES Secretariat before PICES-2011 in Khabarovsk, 
Russia. 
 
 
Results of activities in 2010 
  
SG-HD first discussed the “conventional” social science disciplines related to EBFM (Step 1).  They are: 
1. Anthropology/Ethnology,  
2. Economics (bioeconomics, decision theory, non-market valuation, commons, accounting, etc.),  
3. Geography/Area studies,  
4. Law/Political science,  
5. Sociology,  
6. Psychology,  
7. Inter-disciplinary methodologies (impact analysis, GIS, management science, etc.).  
 
The Study Group also made a table of social scientific tools in each discipline which can be applied to EBFM 
studies. 
  
Each member of the Study Group reviewed applications of the social scientific tools identified in Step 1, and 
reported the results at the Group’s inter-sessional meeting held in Yokohama in June 2010 (Steps 2 and 3).  
The travel costs of two participants were covered by PICES, and other expenses were covered by each PICES 
member country and the Fisheries Research Agency of Japan.  
  
At the Yokohama meeting, Canada discussed marine use, demographic analysis, etc. in the Pacific North Coast 
Integrated Management Area (PNCIMA), a guidance document on the use of socio-economic objectives for 
the creation of MPAs.  China presented the new development of Marine Ecosystem Service Evaluation 
Software, and its application to the Yellow Sea, South China Sea, East China Sea, and Bohai Sea. Social 
analysis in Sato-Umi (village sea) initiatives and institutional analysis of the Shiretoko World Natural Heritage 
site were summarized by Japan.  Korea talked about the application of the IFRAME (Integrated Fisheries Risk 
Assessment, forecasting and Management for Ecosystems) for large purse seiners and bioeconomics for 
Resource Recovery Plan, etc.  Russia showed a case study of non-market valuation of ecosystem values at 
Kamchatka, or economic losses from water pollution in Primorsky Kray.  The United States reviewed 
NOAA’s Annual Stock Assessment, the NEPA Environmental Assessment, and Integrated Ecosystem 
Assessment in the Puget Sound. 
  
Based on the results of Step 3 (from the Yokohama inter-sessional meeting), the Study Group members 
conducted an additional review of social scientific tools for EBFM (Step 4), and discussed the contents of the 
final report via e-mail (Step 5).  
  
On October 22, 2010, the Study Group held its final meeting at PICES-2010 (Step 6).  At this meeting, the 
detailed structure of the Study Group final report was decided.  The Study Group also discussed the role of 
social sciences in EBFM as follows: 1) to make scientific inputs on how to define/select the goals, objectives, 
PICES Scientific Report No. 39  39 
Appendices  Section 8 
40  PICES Scientific Report No. 39 
indicators, targets, etc., 2) to make scientific inputs on how to judge/asses the performances of specific EBM 
measures, 3) to improve the value of bio-physical information (for better understanding by the public, 
management and fishers), 4) to propose spatial/temporal/organizational scales for EBFM, coordinating with 
existing institutional scales (stake holders) and natural scientific knowledge. 
  
Finally, the Study Group drafted the recommendations. In order to better understand and communicate the 
societal implications of the conditions and future trends of North Pacific marine ecosystems (FUTURE vision), 
it is desirable to establish a new expert group related to social sciences.  The terms of reference for the new 
group would include a survey/assessment of the needs of potential stakeholders for FUTURE products, and 
scientific clarification of differences in societal objectives and needs among stakeholders in different sectors 
and countries.  For example, the new expert group will be engaged in vulnerability analysis, indicators on 
human dimensions for EBFM, bioeconomics, etc.  The Study Group also agreed that the new expert group can 
make a contribution to the next North Pacific Ecosystem Status Report, and organize a symposium on Human 
Dimensions for EBFM.  
 
The draft of the final report with recommendations will be finished by the end of January 2011 (Step 7).  
However, because the issue of human dimensions is important and relevant to the FUTURE program 
(especially to SOFE-AP) and several other groups within PICES, we suggested it is important to circulate this 
draft to other groups for their comments and suggestions.  The revised version, which includes comments, will 
be submitted to the inter-sessional Science Board meeting (expected to be held in April 2011).  Based on the 
comments received at the inter-sessional meeting, SG-HD will finalize the report and recommendations by 
PICES-2011.

PICES PUBLICATIONS 
The North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES) was established by an international convention 
in 1992 to promote international cooperative research efforts to solve key scientific problems in the North 
Pacific Ocean. 
PICES regularly publishes various types of general, scientific, and technical information in the following 
publications: 
PICES ANNUAL REPORTS – are major 
products of PICES Annual Meetings which 
document the administrative and scientific activities 
of the Organization, and its formal decisions, by 
calendar year.   
PICES SCIENTIFIC REPORTS – include 
proceedings of PICES workshops, final reports of 
PICES expert groups, data reports and planning 
reports.
PICES TECHNICAL REPORTS – are on-line 
reports published on data/monitoring activities that 
require frequent updates. 
SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS – are products that 
are destined for general or specific audiences.
JOURNAL SPECIAL ISSUES – are peer-
reviewed publications resulting from symposia 
and Annual Meeting scientific sessions and 
workshops that are published in conjunction with 
commercial scientific journals.   
BOOKS – are peer-reviewed, journal-quality 
publications of broad interest. 
PICES PRESS – is a semi-annual newsletter 
providing timely updates on the state of the 
ocean/climate in the North Pacific, with highlights of

Front cover figure 
The PICES Study Group on Human Dimensions found an extremely rich scientific and cultural context 
for fisheries in the PICES area.  For this reason we have selected two illustrations for our report.  The first 
shows the “Safe-catch festival” in Japan where local fishers are praying about the safety of fisheries 
operations and big catch.  The second shows the Fishermen’s Memorial in Seattle, U.S.A. as 
representative of the risks and rewards of fishing in the North Pacific. The message in all of this is that 
human dimensions of coastal and marine ecosystems are important and worthy of study.
