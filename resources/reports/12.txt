PREFACE  
 
 
The Second PICES Workshop on the Okhotsk Sea and Adjacent Areas was held in Nemuro, Japan, 
November 9-12, 1998.  The workshop was coordinated by the Physical Oceanography and Climate 
Committee (POC) of PICES, and co-convened by Drs. Yutaka Nagata, Vyacheslav B. Lobanov and 
Lynne D. Talley (absent at the meeting).  POC recognized the importance of the Okhotsk Sea, where 
sea ice is formed at the lowest latitudes in the world, and also as the formation area of North Pacific 
Intermediate Water (NPIW).  POC previously formed PICES Working Group 1 on the Okhotsk Sea, 
and published a review volume "The Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio Region" in 1995 (PICES Scientific 
Report No. 2).  Following this, PICES held the first Workshop on the Okhotsk Sea and Adjacent Areas 
in Vladivostok, Russia, in June 1995, the proceedings of which were published as PICES Scientific 
Report No. 6 in 1996.  In addition, POC published the "Multilingual Nomenclature of Place and 
Oceanographic Names in the Region of the Okhotsk Sea” as PICES Scienctific Report No. 8 in 1998.  
There has been a great deal of recent research activities in the Okhotsk Sea and adjacent areas, and 
many new findings and new knowledge have been generated since the first workshop in Vladivostok.  
The purpose of this Second Workshop is to exchange new findings and recent research results, and to 
review on-going and in-planning international and domestic projects in order to improve cooperative 
research.  
 
The workshop was opened by the Mayor of Nemuro City, Mr. Hiroshi Fujiwara, and Dr. Vyacheslav 
B. Lobanov explained the aims and the expected products of the workshop.  The workshop discussion 
focussed mainly on physical oceanography, and talks covered a wide range of research:  sea-ice 
characteristics and its movements;  the relation between ice-cover and atmospheric conditions;  sea-ice 
and dense water (NPIW) formation; ventilation and modification of water masses;  tides and their 
effects on water mixing and on water exchanges through straits;  meso-scale eddies, yearly to decadal 
temporal variations, oceanographic databases and atlases; and the relation of the oceanic state to 
spawning grounds and to the nutrient and chlorophyll-a distributions.  Relations of these to local 
environments such as the northern Okhotsk Sea Shelf, on the Sakhalin and west Kamchatka shelves, in 
the Kuril Islands region, and in the Soya (La Peoruse) Strait and northern coast of Hokkaido, were 
discussed.  There were 42 participants and 38 presentations including 10 posters (22 papers and 10 
posters by Russian scientists, 15 papers by Japanese scientists, and 1 paper by a US scientist). 
 
Most of the on-going and in-planning international programs were discussed: such as the Soya/La 
Perouse program conducted by Sakhalin Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (SakhNIRO) 
and the Hokkaido Central Fisheries Experimental Station, the Joint Japanese-Russian-US Study of the 
Sea of Okhotsk, and the joint studies between Pacific Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography 
(TINRO) and the Hokkaido National Fisheries Research Institute.  Several research activities in Japan 
and Russia, for example, the Japanese Hydrographic Department, the Hokkaido University group, the 
Pacific Oceanological Institute (POI), TINRO, the Far Eastern Regional Hydrometeorological Research 
Institute (FERHRI), were also introduced.  Additional information was presented on the future activities 
relating to these projects during the plenary session by participating institutes and scientists.  The 
participants of the workshop appreciated these efforts, and were impressed by the recent progress of the 
many Okhotsk Sea studies.  However, there are still many problems to be solved, and many logistic 
and other kinds of difficulties in expanding our research activities and in organizing further 
international cooperative studies on the Okhotsk Sea area.   
 
The workshop recommends that PICES endorse and support the international cooperative projects 
mentioned above and that are to be developed in the near future.  The activities should be extended not 
only to the Okhotsk Sea, but also to the Kuril Islands region and the Western Subarctic Gyre.  PICES 
member countries bordering the Okhotsk Sea should facilitate access to investigators to cooperate on 
scientific research in the region.  The workshop participants greatly appreciate the publication of the 
proceedings of this workshop in the PICES Scientific Report Series, and agreed that Drs. Vyacheslav 
B. Lobanov, Stephen C. Riser and Yutaka Nagata will serve as co-editors of the publication.  The 
workshop also recommends that POC/PICES continue to overview and support the Okhotsk 
Searesearch activities, and consider holding another workshop in the near future, if warranted.  
Although the subjects of workshop talks were focussed on physical oceanography, many of the projects 
introduced are carried out in cooperation with other disciplines.  The workshop recommends that the 
PICES Implementation Panel on Climate Change and Carrying Capacity takes the initiative to organize 
a GLOBEC-like study for the Okhotsk Sea area. 
 
The workshop was closed following farewell addresses by the Vice-Chairman of the Nemuro Workshop 
Supporting Committee, Mr. Nobuyuki Fukui (Chairman of the Nemuro Junior Chamber) and the 
former PICES Science Board Chairman, Dr. Makoto Kashiwai.  As mentioned by the PICES Executive 
Secretary, Dr. W. Doug McKone, at the Welcome Reception held by Nemuro City on the evening of 
November 10, this workshop is already the fifth PICES meeting in Nemuro.  All of the participants 
thanked the people of Nemuro for the support and hard work in providing facilities for PICES 
meetings, and expressed their thanks for the financial support given by Nemuro City, Hokkaido 
University and other institutions.  Without this support the outcome of the workshop would be 
substantially limited. 
 
The proceedings of the Second PICES Workshop on the Okhotsk Sea and Adjacent Areas are published 
according to a POC/Science Board recommendation at the Seventh Annual Meeting in Fairbanks, 
Alaska.  I would like to thank the PICES Secretariat for its support in various phases of editing.

Long-term tendencies of sea ice concentration and air temperature in the 
Okhotsk Sea coast of Hokkaido 
 
Masaaki AOTA 
 
Sea Ice Research Laboratory, Hokkaido University, Mombetsu, Japan 
 
The Okhotsk Sea Coast of Hokkaido is located 
between 43°50'N and 45°30'N, and is covered 
with sea ice in winter season.  These latitudes are 
the lowest among seas which are frozen in 
winter, except the very shallow Bohai Sea filled 
with much fresher water.  The period when the 
coastal region is ice covered has been decreasing 
during recent years. 
 
Long-term observations of sea ice coverage are 
rare, but along the Okhotsk Coast of Hokkaido, 
the Abashiri Weather Station of Hokkaido started 
sea ice observation in 1892.  The Abashiri 
District Meteorological Observatory took over 
this observation later, and it is still continuing.  
This is one of the longest records of sea ice 
observation.  Using these data, we discuss the 
long-term trend of the sea ice coverage of the 
Okhotsk Sea Coast of Hokkaido and its relation to 
the yearly mean air temperature. 
 
Data and definition of accumulated ice 
concentration  
 
The visual sea ice observations have been made 
from top of a coastal hill (approximately 40 m 
high).  The observable radius is about 20 km. In 
the early period from 1892 to 1929, only the day 
of first appearance of sea ice and that of the last 
day are available.  We call this the period from 
the day of the first appearance to the last day the 
sea ice period.  Daily data on sea ice 
concentration are available after 1930.  The first 
appearance of sea ice along the Okhotsk Coast of 
Hokkaido is in late January or in February.  The 
ice disappears usually in late March, but it may 
stay until May in some years.  The sea ice 
concentration is defined as the area of ice cover 
within the range of observation, in percent. 
 
Characteristics of the sea ice are represented both 
by the sea ice extent or the sea ice concentration 
and by the duration of ice stay.  For the years 
after 1930, the daily value of sea ice 
concentration (%) is summed for the period of ice 
cover in each year, and this accumulated sea ice 
concentration (%-days) is used as a measure of 
annual sea ice strength.  The correlation between 
the obtained accumulated concentration and the 
sea ice period were examined for the period after 
1930, and we found a good correlation with a 
coefficient of about 0.8 (n= 68).  For the period 
before 1929, we estimated the accumulated 
concentration from the observed sea ice period, 
by using the regression line of the correlation 
plots, and used this result in our analysis. 
 
Interannual variation of the accumulated sea 
ice concentration and the mean air 
temperature 
 
The mean air temperature averaged over the 
period from April in the preceding year to March 
are calculated for each year, and its temporal 
variation is shown (Fig. 1a) for the period from 
1892 to 1998.  The corresponding temporal 
variation of the accumulated sea ice concentration 
is also shown (Fig. 1b).  Though relatively short-
period fluctuations are dominant in both curves, 
the linear trends of the variation can be 
recognized in both curves.  The mean air 
temperature tends to increase for the analyzed 
period, while the accumulated sea ice 
concentration to decrease.

Long-term tendencies of accumulated sea ice 
concentration and mean air temperature 
 
Thirty year running averages of the yearly 
values of the accumulated sea ice concentration 
were calculated, and the obtained smoothed 
temporal variations are shown (Fig. 2).  The 
smoothed air temperature (black circles in Fig. 
2) exhibits a clear increasing tendency, and the 
amount of temperature increase during the past 
106 years is about 0.6°C.  On the other hand, 
the smoothed accumulated sea ice concentration 
(black squares in Fig. 2) tends to decrease 
during the analyzed period, and the sea ice 
concentration in 1980 is only 60% of that in 1920s. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The clear decreasing tendency of the sea ice amount 
along the Okhotsk Coast of Hokkaido during the 
past 106 years can be shown from the ice 
concentration record taken at Abashiri, Hokkaido.  
The long-term variation of the sea ice concentration 
is well correlated with that of the yearly mean air 
temperature, which exhibits the clear increasing 
tendency during the same period.  This would be 
one of the symptoms of the global warming, and is 
a warning to human beings!

Abstract 
 
The Okhotsk Sea and the Barents Sea are known to be ice covered during a part of the year and ice free 
in the rest of the year.  The conditions surrounding both seas constitute their environment and contrib-
ute to the creation and maintenance of this particular state, which are investigated in geographic terms 
in this article.  The common features of the two seas as well as the contrasting ones are elucidated.  The 
results serves the investigation of a seasonally ice covered sea generally.  
 
 
Introduction 
 
Among the seas which are ice covered in winter 
and ice free during the summer months, the Bar-
ents Sea and the Okhotsk Sea are located at the 
northernmost and the southernmost extremes in 
the northern hemisphere, respectively.  This arti-
cle compares the seas in terms of geography, on 
which many, if not all, studies are based.  There 
can be some similarities in geographic elements, 
since both seas belong to an identical type, i.e. 
the seasonally ice covered sea.  The problem can 
be, however, formulated differently for each sea: 
why is the sea at that high/low latitude open in 
summer or frozen in winter, respectively.  Hence 
contrasting elements are also expected.  Through 
the comparative study, not only the characteris-
tics of the two seas but that of a seasonally ice 
covered sea in general may be elucidated. 
 
Scope 
 
The Barents Sea and the Okhotsk Sea are shown 
in Figure 1.  The surface area of each is defined 
to be the area inside of the curves drawn on the 
plane of the sea surface for the purpose of discus-
sion: coast line of the continent, that of islands, 
linear lines connecting pairs of peninsulas facing 
to each other.  Each sea is then defined to be the 
water body underneath the area.  The Barents Sea 
and the Okhotsk Sea thus defined have particular 
shape and extent, and are placed at a particular 
location relative to the earth.  The seas are de-
scribed in this aspect in the next chapter. 
 
The boundary of the seas consists of three differ-
ent materials: rock, air and water.  The water 
body in question is thus surrounded by the sea 
bed, by the overlying atmosphere and by the ad-
jacent sea, and interact with them.  The attaching 
neighbors are described in separate chapters in 
this order. 
 
The Barents Sea and the Okhotsk Sea obtain cer-
tain characteristics and present a particular state 
at a given time under the influence of these geo-
graphic elements.  The detailed investigation of 
the seas themselves are certainly the most inter-
esting and important topic, but are beyond the 
scope of the current article.  The state of the sea 
is in fact merely regarded as the results of the 
geographical conditions.  Nevertheless, a brief 
sketch of the present state of both seas is given in 
the succeeding chapter to get some idea to make 
the comparison possible.  In the last section the 
similarity and difference of the Barents Sea and 
the Okhotsk Sea are discussed. 
 
Geometry 
 
The Okhotsk Sea is bounded by land, i.e. a con-
tinent or large islands at northeast, north, west 
and south.  Two straits cut the land boundary, 
which connect the Okhotsk Sea to the 
 
4
 
Fig. 1 Two seasonally ice covered seas. 
 
neighboring Japan Sea.  An island chain, Kuril 
Islands, draws the southeastern boundary, where 
the water body has direct contact to the Pacific 
Ocean. 
 
The Okhotsk Sea covers an area of 1.5×10
6
 km
2
.  
The mean depth is 0.8×10
3
 m, and the total vol-
ume is 1.2×10
6
 km
3
 (National Astronomical Ob-
servatory, 1995).  The total length of the bound-
ary is 10043 km (6787 km), of which 9483 km 
(6227 km) is the coast line and 560 km is the 
boundary running on water.  The contact with the 
Pacific prevails with the length of 513 km, whilst 
that to the Japan Sea is 47 km, through 7 km of 
Tatar Strait and 40 km of Soya Strait.  These 
measurement were made from maps (Energy, 
Mines and Resources Canada, 1990; Nomura, 
1997) where no reference is given. 
 
The coast line length can be increased arbitrarily 
by using a large scale map, especially where the 
coast line is complicated in the shape, e.g. fjord.  
The comparison in the length with the boundary 
on the water, which is a linear line according to 
the definition, would be difficult.  The coast line 
was smoothed for this purpose only, by cutting 
off the small bays with an entrance width of 100 
km or less.  The boundary length of thus 
smoothed sea is given in the parenthesis.  The 
Okhotsk Sea is a water body surrounded in the 
first place by a land mass, 92 % of the boundary 
length, with some opening to adjacent seas, 8 %. 
 
The Barents Sea covers an area of 1.4×10
6
km
2
 
including the White Sea.  Mean depth is 
0.2×10
3
m (Dzhenyuk and Zykova,1992), and the 
volume is 0.3×10
6
 km
3
.  The southern side is 
bordered by a continent and the eastern and 
northwestern sides by large islands.  Three straits 
cut through the land boundary to the east:  Maly-
gina Strait of 8 km wide, Karskiye Vorota Strait 
of 61 km wide, Matochkin Shar Strait of 4 km 
wide which connects the Barents Sea with the 
Kara Sea (Dzhenyuk and Zykova,1992). Scat-
tered small islands, Zemlya Frantsa Iosifa, are 
located on the northeastern boundary, through 
which the Barents Sea has contact with the Arctic 
Sea and Kara Sea.  The western boundary has a 
single small island, Bear Island, and is practically 
open to an ocean, the Norwegian Sea. 
 
The total boundary length is 9955 km (5639 km), 
of which the coastline is 8399 km (4083 km).  
The length of the border to other sea is 1556 km, 
 
5
of which 640 km is the boundary to the Norwe-
gian Sea (75% of the border is land).  The con-
tact length to the Norwegian Sea occupies 41% of 
the total water boundary. 
 
The Okhotsk Sea is located at the latitude of 
45°N to 60°N and the Barents Sea is at 68°N to 
80°N.  The latitudes of the centers are assumed 
to be 53°N and 74°N, respectively. Latitude has 
a direct influence on the potential solar radiation.  
The cosine is considered to its index and is calcu-
lated for both latitudes, and for different position 
of the sun.  In summer, they are 0.870 for the 
Okhotsk Sea and 0.636 for the Barents Sea and 
do not differ from each other so much as the lati-
tude difference would indicate.  In the fall and 
spring, they are 0.602 and 0.276.  The Okhotsk 
Sea receives double the amount of solar radiation 
in comparison to the Barents Sea.  The difference 
becomes more clear in winter, they are 0.233 and 
0, the cosine value being negative in Barents Sea. 
 
Geology 
 
Both seas with the given geometry are placed on 
the surface of the earth, where the distribution of 
the land has been established.  They are placed at 
rather contrasting locations in relation to the land 
mass.  The Barents Sea is attached to a northern 
coast at the west of the Eurasia Continent, and 
Okhotsk Sea is located on the southern coast at 
the east of the same continent. 
 
The northern coast of Asia is attached to the wid-
est continental shelf in the world.  The Barents 
Sea is located entirely on the shelf. Caledonian 
and Uralian trends dominate in the old platform 
probably originating in the Archaean.  The base-
ment is covered by several layers of sediment 
(Embleton, 1984).  This continental shelf is sus-
pected to have been completely covered by an ice 
sheet in the last glacier age, hence the Barents 
Sea became filled quite recently.  The sea bottom 
is not completely flat, but retains the landscape 
created underneath the ice sheet.  Two wide sub-
merged valleys run toward southwest and north 
respectively.  The Barents Sea itself is shallow 
with the depth range of 100 m to 400 m, but to 
the north the shelf drops to the Nansen Basin with 
the depth exceeding 3000 m and to the west to the 
Norwegian Basin with depth exceeding 2000 m. 
 
The northern half of the Okhotsk Sea is also on 
the continental shelf. Forty percent of the area 
has the depth 200m (Wadachi, 1987).  The Ku-
ril Island chain was created as an island arc while 
the Pacific Plate submerges underneath the conti-
nent.  A trench was made on the ocean side of the 
arc, and a basin on the other side, in the Okhotsk 
Sea.  Thus the southeastern part of the Okhotsk 
Sea is quite deep.  The area with a depth >3000 
m is 1.6×10
5
 km
2
, 10% of the entire sea (Wa-
katsuchi and Martin, 1990).  The age of the base-
ment of Kuril Basin is estimated to be 120 to 140 
million years, the Cretaceous.  The thickness of 
the sedimentary cover in the Okhotsk Sea exceeds 
6 km in some place.  Buried and submarine vol-
canic structures are found in the Kuril Basin 
(Shilo et al., 1982).  The land surrounding the 
Okhotsk Sea is mountainous and volcanically ac-
tive. 
 
The total annual discharge of freshwater into the 
Okhotsk Sea is estimated to be 590 km
3
 (Groves 
and Nunt, 1980), of which the continental runoff 
is 463 km
3
/year (Zuenko and Yurasov, 1997).  
The majority of the freshwater is supplied by the 
Amur River, 315 km
3
 /year (Zuenko and Yura-
sov, 1997).  The drainage area of the Okhotsk 
Sea is 2.6×10
6
 km
2
 (4.1×10
6
 km
2
, including the 
sea surface), of which the drainage basin of Amur 
is 1.8×10
6
 km
2
. 
 
The Dvina and the Pechora are major rivers flow-
ing into the Barents Sea.  The drainage area of 
the Barents Sea is 1.3×10
6
 km
2
 (2.7×10
6
 km
2
, 
including sea surface),of which the Dvina is 
0.3×10

Climate 
 
In winter, the Siberian high pressure develops on 
the continent adjacent to the Okhotsk Sea and the 
westerly wind blows onto the sea.  The cold con-
tinental air meets the warm sea water and causes 
a considerable amount of precipitation.  The large 
part of the Okhotsk Sea is classified as "Dfc" in 
Köppen climate classification, meaning that the 
monthly mean temperature of the coldest month is 
below -3°C, that of the warmest month is above 
10°C but that of the fourth warmest month does 
not exceed 10°C, and that the region has rich 
precipitation all year through. The northwestern 
part is classified "Dwc", which describes the dif-
ference from Dfc, being dry in winter. 
 
The systematic weather record for a certain time 
length is available on the coastal stations.  For 
instance, at Abashiri, at the southernmost bound-
ary, the annual mean air temperature is 6.0°C, 
the monthly mean temperature stays below 0°C 
for 4 months (National Astronomical Observa-
tory, 1995).  At the western boundary, at Chaivo 
Bay on Sakhalin Island, the air temperature 
ranges from 20°C to -30°C in a year (Shirasawa 
et al., 1996).  Mean air temperature at Okhotsk 
Sea is estimated to be -6°C in winter and 18°C in 
summer (Groves and Nunt, 1980), using the data 
obtained on the sea and at the coastal stations.  
Extreme winter temperatures on the sea assumes 
the range from 0°C at the southern part in a 
warm year to -32°C at the northern part in a cold 
year (Wakatsuchi and Martin, 1990).  The annual 
precipitation at Nemuro, at the southern bound-
ary, is recorded to be 1370 mm, which is distrib-
uted in all the months of the year.  At Okhotsk 
City, at the northern boundary, 467 mm of the 
precipitation is concentrated in summer.  At Ust 
Khayryuzovo, at the eastern boundary, 766 mm 
of the annual precipitation is obtained and at Ni-
kolaevskna-Amure, at the western boundary, 657 
mm, mostly in summer and autumn at the both 
stations (Korzun et. al., 1974). 
 
The precipitation over the Okhotsk Sea is esti-
mated using these observations.  At the southern 
Okhotsk Sea, annual precipitation is 1200 mm 
and in the northern part, 600 mm.  It decreases 
toward the center of the sea, where the minimum 
value of 400 mm is calculated.  Annual evapora-
tion is estimated to be 400 mm in the central part 
of the Okhotsk Sea.  It increases to the south and 
southeast (Korzun et.al., 1974). 
 
At the stations on the continental coast, along the 
northern boundary, the northerly wind prevails at 
the speed around 4.5 m/s in January (Fukutomi, 
1952).  The northwesterly wind prevails at Val, 
Sakhalin Island at an annual mean speed of 4 m/s.  
The wind speed is slightly higher during the win-
ter (Shirasawa et al., 1996).  At stations on the 
southern boundary, the monthly wind is reported: 
north or northwest at 4.6 m/s in February and 
March and south-southwest at 4.4 m/s in April 
(Fukutomi, 1952).  At the Okhotsk Sea the wind 
seems to blow from the north, northeast, or 
northwest in winter (Parkinson and Gratz, 1983) 
and this northerly wind transports sea ice from 
the northwest continental shelf region to the 
southern area (Wakatsuchi and Martin, 1990). 
 
The Barents Sea is in the Atlantic Arctic Frontal 
Zone, where the Arctic air mass and the polar air 
mass contact each other.  The warm cyclones 
from the northern Atlantic and the cold anti-
cyclones from the Arctic meet each other in the 
region (Groves and Nunt, 1980).  Compared with 
other circum-Arctic seas, the Barents Sea has 
high air temperature and precipitation (Groves 
and Nunt, 1980).  The Barents Sea area is classi-
fied as "E" in the Köppen climate classification, 
meaning that the mean monthly temperature of 
the warmest month does not exceed 10°C. 
 
At Murmansk, on the southern boundary of Bar-
ents Sea, the annual mean air temperature is re-
ported to be –0.1°C, and during six months of 
the year the monthly mean stays <0°C (National 
Astronomical Observatory, 1995).  The annual 
mean air temperature decreases toward the east 
along the southern boundary, -2.9°C at North 
Kolguev, and -5.6°C at Varandey.  At Varandey, 
the monthly mean air temperature of February is 
-18.3°C and the absolute recorded minimum is –
48°C (Strass et al., 1997).  The air temperature 
on the Barents Sea is estimated to fall as one 
moves from south to north and from west to east 
 
7
within the area.  The annual mean air temperature 
ranges from <0°C to 10°C (Strass et al., 1997). 
 
At Vardo, at the southern boundary, the annual 
precipitation is recorded to be 1043 mm, most of 
which falls in winter.  At Murmansk, also at the 
southern boundary but shifted a couple of hun-
dreds of kilometers toward east, it is 589 mm, 
which is distributed throughout the year.  At Bear 
Island, at the western boundary, it is 560 mm, 
where the summer precipitation is only half of 
that in winter.  At Zemlya Frantsa Iosifa, at the 
northern boundary, it is 254 mm and at Mal. 
Karmakuly, at the eastern boundary, it is 413 
mm. Most of the precipitation at the last two sta-
tions are recorded in summer and autumn.  In the 
Barents Sea, the annual precipitation is estimated 
to be 1000 mm in the southwestern part, and de-
creases toward north and east to 300-400 mm.  
The seasonal change is considerably variable in 
pattern within the region. 
 
The annual evaporation is estimated to be 800 
mm in the southwestern part of the Barents Sea, 
and decreases toward north.  In the northern part 
it reaches the minimum value of 100 mm (Korzun 
et al., 1974).  At Kolguev Island, at the southern 
boundary, the southwesterly wind prevails at 
mean wind speed of 8.2 m/s in winter, but is 
scattered in all the directions in summer.  The 
wind speed is higher in winter than in summer 
(Strass et al., 1997).  At Hopen Island, at the 
western area, the monthly mean wind speed of 
13-16 m/s is reported for November (Løset and 
Carstens, 1996).  In the western part of the Bar-
ents Sea, the annual mean wind speed is esti-
mated to exceed 9 m/s, with a maximum of 36 
m/s.  The wind speed decreases to the east and to 
the north.  The wind speed is higher in winter, 
and is lowest in July (Strass et al., 1997).  The 
wind direction is generally scattered in all direc-
tions.  However, the strong wind has a particular 
direction, which is variable from a place to an-
other; southwesterly wind in the western part and 
easterly wind in the northern and eastern parts. 
Adjacent ocean 
 
The cross section, through which the Okhotsk Sea 
and Pacific Ocean maintain the direct contact to 
each other, has an area of 200 km (Wadachi, 
1987).  The surface water temperature of the Pa-
cific Ocean near the cross section is reported to 
be 1°C to 2°C in February, and around 10°C in 
August.  The surface salinity is 33 psu in Febru-
ary (Wadachi, 1987). 
 
At the surface, the Pacific Ocean water enters the 
Okhotsk Sea through the northern part of Kuril 
chain and the water flows out from the Okhotsk 
Sea into the Pacific Ocean through southern part 
of Kuril chain (Wadachi, 1987).  At depth, the 
water flows out to the Pacific Ocean at the upper 
layer, e.g. through Bussol Straits at the southern 
Kuril chain, but the Pacific water flows in at the 
deep layer below 1500 m (Wadachi, 1987; Wa-
katsuchi and Martin, 1990).  The Pacific water is 
warmer, more saline and poor in oxygen at all the 
depth compared with the water of Okhotsk Sea 
(Wakatsuchi and Martin, 1990).  Hence the Pa-
cific water is the source of the heat and salt but a 
sink for oxygen, when an exchange takes place 
across the cross section. 
 
The Barents Sea has cross sections through which 
it has contact with adjacent seas: 160 km
2
 to the 
Norwegian Sea, 53 km
2
 to the Arctic Sea and 166 
km
2
 to the Kara Sea (Dzhenyuk and Zykova, 
1992).  A comparatively warm (4 to 12°C) and 
saline (>35 psu) Atlantic water, a branch of the 
Gulf Stream, flows into the Barents Sea through 
the western boundary between North Cape and 
Bear Island (Groves and Nunt, 1980).  The At-
lantic water serves as the source of heat and salt. 
The surface current enters the Barents Sea with a 
speed of 0.75 to 0.8 m/s passing by Tromsoflaket 
from west.  Cold Arctic water flows into the Bar-
ents Sea across its northern boundary through two 
routes, between Svalbard and Zemlya Frantsa 
Iosifa, and between Zemlya Frantsa Iosifa and 
Novaya Zemlya (Løset and Carstens, 1996).  The 
Barents Sea contacts the ice sea at the northern 
boundary; the ice concentration in the area im-
 
8
mediately to the north of the Barents Sea is re-
ported to have exceeded 80% in the summer of 
1980 (Løset et al., 1997).  Multi-year ice is 
dominant and the mean ice thickness exceeds 2.0 
m.  The Arctic Sea is thus a two-fold heat sink, 
i.e. cold water (sensible heat) and ice supplier 
(latent heat) to the Barents Sea, and is an addi-
tional source of the fresh water in the solid form. 
 
State of the sea 
 
At the Okhotsk Sea, the temperature of the sur-
face water ranges from -1.8°C in winter to 18°C 
in summer (Groves and Nunt, 1980).  The salin-
ity of the surface water is reported to be 32 to 
32.5 psu in summer (Wadachi,1987). There is 
counterclockwise current on the surface in the 
Okhotsk Sea. 
 
The sea ice is first formed in the northern part of 
the sea in the middle of November.  The maxi-
mum development is reached in the middle of 
March; 80 % of the total area is covered by sea 
ice (Wadachi, 1987).  There is no sea ice found 
in the summer months, from July to October.  All 
sea ice is first year ice or younger in the Okhotsk 
Sea.  The mean ice thickness in March is re-
ported to be 1.0 m in the northern part, and 0.4 
to 0.5 m in the southern part. (Wadachi, 1987; 
Aota and Uematsu, 1989). 
 
At the Barents Sea, the temperature of the surface 
water ranges from -2°C in winter to 8°C in 
summer (Wadachi, 1987).  The salinity of the 
surface water is around 34 psu in summer.  The 
current is directed eastward in the southern part 
and westward and southward in the northern part 
(Løset and Carstens, 1996).  The first sea ice ap-
pears in the northern and eastern area in October, 
and the maximum extension is reached in April.  
There is no sea ice in August and September. The 
southern quarter of the sea is ice free year round, 
except some bays and fjords (Groves and Nunt, 
1980).  The most common ice is first year ice. 
The ice thickness can be up to 2 m for first-year 
ice, and 3 to 5 m for multi-year ice.  The mean 
ice thickness of the region is estimated to be 0.9 
to 1.2 m (Løset et al., 1997). Icebergs are also 
found in the Barents Sea.  Mean sail height is 
estimated to be 15 m, and the mean diameter is 
92 m (Løset and Carstens, 1996).  
 
Comparison 
 
The Okhotsk Sea and Barents Sea have several 
common features.  The areal extent of the seas is 
quite similar, and the both are attached to the 
same continent and bounded by islands of various 
size, so that they have characteristics of a semi-
mediterranean sea.  A large part of the seas are 
shallow, but adjacent oceans are quite deep. 
 
The air temperature, precipitation and evapora-
tion have a similar range over the both seas.  
Hence, the climatic condition of the seas does not 
differ much in spite of the latitude difference.  
They are both generally windy seas and the wind 
speed is greater in winter.  The strong wind is 
oriented in particular directions.  Although the 
drainage area of the Barents Sea is half that of the 
Okhotsk Sea and the total precipitation is similar 
in both basins, a similar amount of total discharge 
is expected due to the difference in the terrestrial 
evaporation.  Both seas have abundant fresh wa-
ter supply in similar quantity. 
 
The northern boundaries connect the seas to the 
coldest part of the continent and the coldest part 
of the ocean in the northern hemisphere respec-
tively.  Toward south both seas are connected to 
the water bodies, which are relatively warm and 
salty. 
 
Differences are also found in the geographic ele-
ments of the Okhotsk Sea and that of the Barents 
Sea.  The Okhotsk Sea has a geometry of a bay, 
where the current can make a round trip in the 
sea, whilst the Barents Sea is a wide channel, 
where two oppositely directed parallel currents 
can pass by each other within the region. 
 
The Okhotsk Sea is strongly influenced by the 
climatic conditions of the continent, which invade 
the region.  The maritime climate governs the 
Barents Sea, and it can be treated as a branch of 
the Atlantic Ocean.  Although both seas are 
windy, there is a difference in the magnitude.  
The mean wind speed at the Barents Sea is esti-
 
9
mated to be almost twice as large as that at the 
Okhotsk Sea.  The transport efficiency of pack 
ice is thus quite high in the former.  The climate 
conditions of surrounding areas of the seas espe-
cially on the continent may differ from each 
other, even when they are similar on the seas.  
For instance, the latitude difference may lead dif-
ferent evaporation in river basins.  The climate in 
enlarged area can thus influence the seas indi-
rectly and possibly in different way.  The Barents 
Sea has a supply of sea ice from the adjacent 
ocean, but no sea ice is produced in the sea 
around the Okhotsk Sea.  Hence, the former has 
an additional fresh water supply in a solid form.

Introduction:  Radar measurements of sea 
ice drift 
Severe ice conditions are typical for the northeas t-
ern shelf of Sakhalin Island. Sea - ice fields in this 
region are large, heavy and fa st moving 
(Po k rasenko et al., 1987).  Examination of these 
m o tions is interesting from the scientific point of 
view and has significant applied importance. In the 
present work we investigate the velocities of ice 
drift induced by tides and wind. The main p urpose 
of the study is to estimate their nature, main p a-
rameters, and maximum values.  
 
The properties of the Okhotsk Sea ice cover are 
determined by the sea circulation, winter winds, 
and tides (Martin et al., 1998).  To examine the 
sea - ice drift in the r egion of oil and natural gas 
fields the Hydrometeorology Division of the Far 
Eastern Marine Engineering and Geology Exped i-
tion (now the Environmental Company of Sakh a-
lin) installed three radar transceivers on the nort h-
eastern coast of Sakhalin Island.  Tem porary 
meteorological stations, measuring wind, atmo s-
pheric pressure, air temperature, precipitation, and 
visibility, were also established in the vicinity of 
these installations whose coordinates were as fo l-
lows: 54.1   N, 142.9   E (Cape Levensterna, 1992 – 19 95), 53.5   N, 143.1   E (Odoptu, 1985 – 1996), and 
51.1   N, 143.6   E (Komrvo, 1991 – 1993). The loc a-
tion of these radar stations and current - meter r e-
corders deployed on the shelf of Sakhalin Island 
are presented in Figure 1. 
 
These radar stations recorded sea - ice d rift at the 
distances of approximately 4, 8, 12 and 18 km (the 
latter only by the Odoptu radar).  Hourly drift ve c-
tors were estimated by the differences in the ice 
field positions.  The positions were fixed three 
times per hour: at 10 to the hour, at the h our and 
10 min after the hour.  We interpolated and ave r-
aged the data and get several hourly vector series 
for each installation.  In this work we analyze only 
the drift series measured at the most distant points 
(12 and 18 km).

Preliminary data anal ysis 
The best quality data were obtained in 1993: 100 – day series (March 1 – June 8) at Cape Levensterna 
(CL), 73 days at Odoptu (OD), and 85 days at 
Komrvo (KM).  We paid the most attention to the 
examination of just these series. 
 
The velocity components of the ice drift were e s-
timated in the eastward ( u ) and northward ( v ) d i-
rections, i.e. in the offshore and longshore dire c-
tions relative to Sakhalin Island (Fig. 2).  The 
offshore velocities were relatively small, of about 
10 – 30 cm/s for all stations.  In co ntrast, the lon g-
shore velocities were strong, approximately 100 
cm/s.  Preliminary analysis showed the dominant 
role of diurnal tides in the longshore drift motions 
(at least for the area of stations CL and OD). 
 
The calculated spectra of u and v component s for 
the radar stations CL, OD, and KM are presented 
in Figure 3.  The northward components dominate 
at all frequencies, however, whereas for the low -
frequency band the difference between the energy 
of two components is significant, for the high -
frequency band it is relatively small.  There are 
two noticeable low - frequency peaks at periods of 
about 12 and 5 days, apparently related to the 
atmospheric activity.  The low - pass filtered data 
show also existence of the oscillations with a p e-
riod of about 21 da ys.  The corresponding peak is 
not seen in Figure 3, but we could detect it based 
on high - resolution spectral analysis.  The same 
peaks were detected in wind spectra (not shown).  
Based on results of rotary spectral analysis (see 
Gonella , (1972)) we found that the angle between 
the wind and ice - drift vectors at the periods of the 
spectral peaks is about 20 – 30   .  
 
The diurnal spectral peak is dominant at stations 
CL and OD, but is insignificant at station KM; the 
semidiurnal oscillations of the sea - ice are s mall at 
all stations (Fig. 3).  These results are in agre e-
ment with the results of Rabinovich and Zhukov 
(1984) and Popudribko et al. (1998), who showed 
that semidiurnal tidal currents are negligible in this 
region, in comparison with diurnal cu r rents. 
 
B ased on the results of the spectral analysis, we 
defined three “natural” frequency bands associated 
with different types of external forcing:  The low 
frequency (LF) band, with frequencies less than 
0.8 cpd; the tidal (TD), with frequencies between 
0.8 and 2.2 cpd; and the high - frequency (HF), with 
frequencies greater than 2.2 cpd.  In the text that 
follows, these three frequency bands are analyzed 
separately.  
Low - frequency wind induced drift 
The low - frequency ice motions, obtained by low -
pass filtering of the residual (non - tidal) series with 
25 - h sliding window, were highly correlated with 
wind.  Figure 4 presents the meridional (alon g-
shore) components of the ice - drift and wind at st a-
tion Odoptu (OD).  We have not found any phase 
shift between the wind and ice drift.  Estimation of 
the correlation function for all three stations 
showed that the sea - ice field responds to wind 
forcing almost immediately.  These results are in 
contrast to the results of Pokrasenko et al. (1987) 
who pointed out that there is 8 - h time shift b e-
tween these pro c esses. 
 
The typical seasonal variations of longshore wind 
and low - frequency ice - drift motions are shown in 
Figure 4.  Northerly and northwesterly winds with 
speeds of about 5 – 8 m/s normally prevail in Jan u-
ary to March on the northeastern coast of Sakhalin 
Island.  These winds are induced by a steady “wi n-
ter monsoon” determining winter weather in this 
region (see Shevchenk o and Saveliev in this 
Fig. 2 Eastward ( u ) and northward ( v ) comp o-
nents of sea ice drift measured by radar at station 
OD in 1993.

volume).  Respectively, wind - induced ice - drift 
motions have southern and southeastern directions.  
The distribution of wind directions is less stable in 
April than in wintertime.  In May southeasterly 
winds of about 3 – 5 m/s (‘summer monsoon’) 
dominate in the area.  The general southward 
propagation of sea ice in May and June is probably 
associated with the Eastern Sakhalin Current. 
 
Strong winds with velocities of about 15 – 25 m/s 
are related to continental cy clones frequently o c-
curring in this region during the ice - covered p e-
riod.  For cyclones crossing Sakhalin Island, wind 
directions change very fast and these winds do not 
produce significant currents and associated ice -
drifts.  In contrast, for cyclones sta ying in the Sea 
of Okhotsk, steady northerly and northwesterly 
winds are rather typical.  Specifically, these winds 
produce maximum velocities of residual (non -
tidal) ice - drift of about 1 m/s traveling in southern 
and southeastern directions. 
 
The high cor relation of low - frequency ice motions 
and wind is clearly seen in Figure 5.  We used a 
linear regression model to estimate, R, the “wind 
coefficient of the ice - drift”.  We made comput a-
tions for longshore and cross - shore components 
independently and obtaine d the following values: 
=
v
R 4.0 (cm/s)/(m/s) (Fig. 5), and =
u
R 2.0 
(cm/s)/(m/s), r e spectively.  That means that a 
longshore wind of 10 m/s induces ice - drift moving 
with a speed of about 40 cm/s, and a cross - shore 
wind of the same speed produces ice - drift of about 
20 cm/s.  These regressional coefficients, 
v
R 
and
u
R , can be used for short - and long - term for e-
casts of ice - drift on the nort h eastern shelf of Sa k-
halin Island.

Tide - induced sea ice drift 
The tide - induced dr ift motions of sea - ice were e s-
timated using the least square method.  The max i-
mum values of the longshore tidal drift velocities 
were found to be of about 100 – 110 cm/s at CL, 
90 – 100 cm/s at OD, and 15 – 25 cm/s at KM radar 
stations.  These large tidal curren ts were related 
mainly to K
1
 and O
1
 diurnal tidal harmonics.  As 
was shown first by Rabinovich and Zhukov 
(1984), and later by other authors (Suzuki and 
Kanari, 1986; Kowalik and Polyakov , 1998), 
strong diurnal currents on the northeastern shelf of 
Sakhali n Island are produced by tidally generated 
trapped shelf waves (a similar effect is well known 
for the Pacific coast of Vancouver Island (cf. 
Crawford and Thomson (1984); Foreman and 
Thomson (1997)). 
 
Normally, for the areas with dominant diurnal 
tides, th e extreme yearly tidal values have a 
prominent 19 - year cycle.  According to the co m-
putations made by Shevchenko et al . (1990), e x-
treme tides for the northeastern shelf of Sakhalin 
Island were observed in 1968 – 1969, 1987 – 1988, 
etc. The year 1993 was the tim e when diurnal tides 
were approximately 20 – 30% weaker.  So, the 
maximum tidal drift velocities can probably reach 
120 – 140 cm/s. 
It follows from the results of spectral analysis 
(Fig. 3), and from direct estimations of tidal cu r-
rents by the least square met hod, that diurnal tides 
play a dominant role in the ice - drift motions at 
stations OD and CL, but are insignificant at KM.  
According to numerical modeling of tides on the 
northeastern shelf of Sakhalin Island (Suzuki and 
Kanari , 1986 ; Kowalik and Polyakov , 1998), diu r-
nal tidal currents are very strong near the northern 
end of the island (the probable generation area of 
shelf waves), and then decrease in the southward 
direction.  A similar picture of strong diurnal tidal 
currents decreasing with distance fro m the gener a-
tion area of diurnal shelf waves (Juan de Fuca 
Strait) was described by Foreman and Thomson 
(1997) for the Pacific shelf of Vancouver Island.  
The main reason of this effect is dissipation of d i-
urnal shelf waves (Rabinovich and Shevchenko , 
1984 ).  It is known that tidal shelf waves are no r-
mally accompanied by strong cu r rents in near -
shore zone (see the review article by Clarke 
(1991)), but bottom friction causes their fast diss i-
pation.  So, we may assume that weakening of d i-
urnal currents and as sociated ice motions in the 
area of Komrvo is related to the decreasing (b e-
cause of dissipation) of shelf waves propagating 
southward along the northeastern coast of Sakhalin 
Island.  The other possibility is the presence of 
local amphidromic points for di urnal tides near to 
Sakhalin Island as was supposed by Rabinovich 
and Zhukov (1984).  Existence of such local a m-
phidromic points for diurnal tides near to the shore 
is also related to the influence of shelf waves (cf. 
Cartwright et al. (1980)). 
 
We constru cted ellipses of the tidal ice - drift for 
major diurnal constituents K
1
 and O
1
.  At stations 
CL and OD these ellipses are very similar:  They 
have approximately the same magnitude, same 
direction of rotation (clockwise) and are strongly 
extended alongshore.  The only significant diffe r-
ence between CL and OD ellipses is the phase 
shift.  These ice - drift ellipses are in very good 
agreement with the respective ellipses of tidal cu r-
rents measured at nearby current - meter stations 
CM1 and CM2 (Fig. 6), as well as with other 
measurements of tidal currents made on the nort h-
eastern shelf of Sakhalin Island (cf. Rabinovich 
and Zhukov (1984); Popudribko et al . (1998)). 
Maximum currents at these stations were about 
40 – 50 cm/s for K
1
 and 35 – 40 cm/s for O
1
. 
 
So stable resu lts and good agreement of ice - drift 
and current  observations  made  at different  years

ponents of wind and low - frequency ice - drift. The

regression model.

and different seasons demonstrate that for the pr e-
diction of tidally induced sea - ice drift on the 
northeastern shelf of Sakhalin Isl and, we can a p-
parently use the results of tidal analysis of currents 
formerly measured in this area.  The other poss i-
bility is to use recent results of numerical mode l-
ing of tides and tidal currents in the Sea of O k-
hotsk (cf. Kowalik and Polyakov (1998)). Both 
approaches could be important for short - and long -
term forecasts of sea ice drift in the vicinity of 
northeastern Sakhalin Island. 
 
The phase shifts of tidal ellipses between CL and 
OD stations (both for K
1
 and O
1
 constituents), co r-
responding to time shifts of about 6 – 7 h, show that 
tidal waves propagate along the northeastern coast 
of Sakhalin Island from north to south (Fig. 1), i.e. 
in the direction coinciding with the theoretical d i-
rection of shelf waves (cf. Rabinovich and Zhukov 
(1984); Kowalik a nd Polyakov (1998)). If the 
same tendency remains southward from Odoptu 
station (at the Piltun - Astokhsk, Chaivinsk or 
Ark u tun - Daginsk oil and gas - bearing areas), then 
tidal sea - ice drifts in the vicinity of Cape Leve n-
sterna and at these areas have opposite directions . 
The southward tidal drift at CL station corr e-
sponds to the northward drift at the southern areas, 
and vice versa. 
 
Following Rabinovich and Zhukov (1984), we 
estimated phase speeds of K
1
 and O
1
 diurnal tidal 
waves using the observed phases of longshore ( v ) 
component of ice - drift at stations CL and OD, and 
currents at stations CM1, CM2, and CM3 (Fig. 5).  
Least - square fit showed that the phases of diurnal 
waves increase southward per 1 degree of latitude 
on 117° (for K
1
) and 101° (for O
1
).  The corr e-
sponding phase speeds are: = c 14.3 – 1.6 km/h 
(K
1
) and = c 15.8 – 1.8 km/h (O
1
).  Evident di s-
persion of d i urnal waves is interesting.  This result 
as well as phase speed magnitudes themselves are 
in good agreem ent with theoretical estimates of 
phase speed of diurnal shelf waves made for this 
region by Rabinovich and Zhukov (1984): 13.9 
km/h (for K
1
) and 15.3 km/h (for O
1
). 
 
Results of tidal analysis show that the diurnal shelf 
waves play a key role in ice - drift motions on the 
northeastern shelf of Sakhalin Island.  The main 
properties of shelf waves are well established (cf.
Fig. 6 Tidal ellipses for the main diurnal co n-
stituent K

 for the ice drift measured by radar at 
stations (a) CL and (b) OD, and for the sea cu r-
rents recorded at s tations (c) CM1 and (d) CM2. 
Note that the scales of vertical (northward) and 
horizontal (eastward) axes are di f ferent.

LeBlond and Mysak (1978)).  So, we can use these 
known properties to describe and predict essential 
features of ice motions in this area. 
 
I t is worthwhile to emphasize another aspect of the 
problem.  A significant influence of shelf waves 
on various dynamical processes on the shelf is 
well known.  In particular, they play an important 
role in sedimentation, meandering of boundary 
currents, co astal upwelling, shelf circulation, fo r-
mation of storm surges, etc. (LeBlond and Mysak, 
1978).  However, this is one of the first demo n-
str a tions of direct influence of shelf waves on ice -
drift.  It is interesting to ask, is it a local phenom e-
non observed o nly in the northern part of the 
northeastern shelf of Sakhalin Island or it has a 
more general character and shelf waves affect the 
behavior of ice motions over the whole region of 
the Okhotsk Sea shelf of Sakhalin?.  We plan to 
use the data from Piltun - As tokh, Arcutun -
Daginsk, and Lunsk marine oil and natural gas -
bearing areas to study this question in the future. 
High - frequency drift 
The difference between u and v components d e-
creases at periods less than diurnal, and became 
negligible at periods of a few hours.  There are no 
noticeable spectral peaks at high frequencies of 
ice - drift motions (Fig. 3).  However, these high -
frequency motions are quite significant (typical 
mean currents are of about 7 – 10 cm/s, maximum 
currents are 20 – 30 cm/s both for u and v comp o-
nents).  Probably, the main source of these ene r-
getic motions is the turbulence induced by the bo t-
tom friction.  Due to strong tidal currents in the 
shallow nearshore zone, there is a crucial effect of 
bottom friction on dynamical processes on the 
she lf of Sakhalin Island.  Stronger high - frequency 
oscillations at CL and OD stations are associated 
with stronger tidal currents in this region, so we 
can assume that we see cascade transfer of tidal 
energy into high frequencies.  As Figure 3 shows, 
in contr ast to tidal and low - frequency bands, the 
difference between longshore and offshore co m-
ponents of ice - drift at high frequencies is very 
small, and they look like the spectra of the Gau s-
sian stochastic process.  A similar picture is o b-
served for high freque ncy current oscillations, 
there is almost no difference between u and v 
components and between surface and near - bottom 
la y ers (Popudribko et al . , 1998). 
Conclusions 
Coastal radar stations can be used effectively to 
measure sea ice drift over the shelf.  T hree radar 
stations established on the coast of Sakhalin Island 
recorded high quality data, which gave us the o p-
portunity to examine ice motions on the northeas t-
ern shelf of the island in a wide frequency range. 
 
Spectral analysis of ice - drift observations revealed 
three major types of ice motions:  (1) Low -
frequency, (2) diurnal, and (3) high - frequency.  
These three types of motions are related to three 
different generation sources:  (1) Atmospheric a c-
tivity, (2) tides, and (3) turbulence. 
 
Low frequency d rift motions are highly correlated 
with wind.  A linear regression model showed that 
‘wind coefficients of drift’ are 4.0 (cm/s)/(m/s) for 
longshore component and 2.0 (cm/s)/(m/s) for 
cross - shore component.  Strong north winds in this 
region can induce ice motions with velocities more 
than 1 m/s.  The computed ‘wind coefficients’ 
may be used for long - term and short term forecast 
of ice drift on the northeastern shelf of Sakhalin 
Island.  
 
Diurnal tides play the major role in the sea - ice m o-
tions in the north ern part of the northeastern shelf 
of Sakhalin.  These diurnal tidal motions have v e-
locities more than 1 m/s.  Computed tidal ellipses 
of ice - drift are in good agreement with the respe c-
tive ellipses of sea currents measured in this r e-
gion.  Computed tidal constituents of currents, as 
well as the results of numerical modeling of tidal 
motions, may be used for the prediction of ice -
motions in the oil and gas - bearing areas of the 
Okhotsk Sea shelf of Sakhalin Island.  
 
Strong diurnal tidal ice - motions on the n ortheas t-
ern shelf of Sakhalin Island are shown to be r e-
lated to diurnal shelf waves.  Phase shifts of K
1
 
and O
1
 tidal ellipses estimated from ice - drift 
measurements and current - meter stations are in 
very good agreement with a theoretical model of 
diurnal s helf waves constructed by Rabinovich and 
Zhukov (1984) for this region. The observed phase 
speeds of K
1
 and O
1
 tidal harmonics are 14.3 and 
15.8 km/h, in comparison with the theoretical va l-
ues 13.9 and 15.3 km/h, respectively. 
 
High frequency (0.1 – 0.5 cph) ice oscillations now 
and then exceed 20 cm/s in this area. In contrast to 
tidal and wind - induced motions, their spectra are 
   
  17
almost isotropic.  It was found that strong high -
frequency ice - motions are normally associated 
with strong tidal motions.  The pro bable reason of 
these oscillations is cascade transfer of tidal e n-
ergy into higher frequencies due to turbulence and 
bottom friction in a sha l low nearshore zone.

Introduction  
Ice cover of the Japan and Okhotsk seas is one of 
the elements of the climatic system of the Far East 
and depends on a large number of the factors 
(Kryndin, 1964; Stolyarova, 1975; Biryulin, 1970; 
Yakunin, 1966; Plotnikov , 1996).  Despite the e x-
tensive data on ice cover of the Far Eastern seas, 
the reasons for interannual and long - term variabi l-
ity are still vague.  
 
The object of this work is to reveal the features in 
variability of the Japan and Okhotsk Seas’ ice 
cover th at depend on atmospheric large - scale pr o-
cesses above the Far East sector of the northern 
hem i sphere. 
Data 
The following have been used: 
 
1. Data on area of ice cover (%) of the Japan and 
Okhotsk Seas (1928 – 1960) published by 
Kryndin (1964) and obtained from t he Far 
Eastern Regional Center of Data Reception 
and Processing (Khabarovsk) – 1961 – 1992. 
Data on ice cover of the Okhotsk Sea for 
1993 – 1998 were received by satellite images 
(TV - and IK - images by “Meteor” and 
NOAA). 
 
2. Data on water temperature at the Holms k H y-
drometeorological Station (1913 – 1996) were 
provided by the Sakhalin Hydrometeorolog i-
cal A d ministration. 
 
3. Average monthly data on geopotential H500 
(dam) at airological stations for January, 
1950 – 1998 were given by the Primorskiy H y-
dromet e orological Ser vice. 
Results 
The long - term variability of ice extent in the Tatar 
Strait (Japan Sea) and Okhotsk Sea is presented in 
Figure 1.  Two periods of ice cover are found in 
the Tatar Strait: one large (1930 – 1960), the other 
small (1962 – 1992). Extrenal low ice co ver was 
marked in 1957 and 1991, and high in 1951, 1954 
and 1960.  The curve of the course of the Okhotsk 
Sea ice cover differs significantly from a curve of 
ice cover in Tatar Strait.  The period of high ice 
cover in winter is for 1966 – 1988 (22 years) in the 
Okhotsk Sea; within this large period 6 – 7 year 
cycles are observed.  The cycle of warm winters 
began in 1989, with ice cover reaching a minimum 
in 1996. 
 
During the almost 70 - yr period for the Okhotsk 
Sea, there were observed two cycles of low ice 
cove r winters: the first from 1952 – 1958 and the 
second from 1990 – 1997, with a minimum in 1996 
(the duration of c y cles is 6 – 7 years). 
 
Ice cover changes have to be examined in the co n-
text of other elements of the climatic system of the 
Far Eastern sector (30° – 6 0°N, 120° – 160°E). From 
temperature data at GMS Holmsk for 1913 – 1996 
(Fig. 2) the warming of coastal waters at western 
Sakhalin in the 1990s can be seen.  The beginning 
of warming goes back to the 1960s and coincides 
with the ice cover change in the Japan S ea.  The 
warming of waters in a surface layer in the sout h-
east and northwest parts of the sea was noted also 
by satellite and hydrological data (Dy a kov, 1996; 
Ponomarev et al., 1997; Shatilina et al., 1998). 
 
Long - term variation of geopotential anomalies 
H 500 for regions (I, II, III) are shown in Figure 3. 
The location of selected domains (regions) and 
airological observatory stations is shown in Figure 
4.  The amplitude of geopotential oscillations over 
the northern part of the Japan Sea. is much higher 
th an over the Okhotsk Sea.  After 1970 in the 
northern areas (II) strong peaks prevailed there, 
which were especially characteristic for 1990s 
(Fig. 3b).  The last decade is especially extremal, 
based on the number of large anomalies.  They 
show changes whic h occurred in eastern Asia.

Fig. 2 Water temperature anomalies at Holmsk 
in January of 1913 – 1996. 
 
Above the Okhotsk Sea are two periods (Fig. 3), 
distinguished b y frequency of recurrence of strong 
peaks of pressure, 1950 – 1969 and 1970 – 1998. 
Great decreases of pressure were marked in 1966, 
1967, 1978, 1979, 1988.  Strong peaks occurred in 
1963, 1974, 1991 and 1997.  The general trend of 
pressure is increasing.  It is traced more strongly in 
the se c ond area. 
 
The course of anomalies of geopotential H500 
clearly testifies that a new period in variation of 
atmospheric circulation over the Far East has b e-
gun since 1989.  These variations have started 
from a sharp growth of pressure in 1989.  In co n-
trast to the northern regions (II and III) after 1989 
in the southern region (I) is a marked pressure 
drop (Fig. 3). 
 
A completely contrasting picture in distribution of 
a field structure H500 in extremal ice cover in 
winter is observed in Figure 4.  So during the e x-
tremal ice winters (1954) the Okhotsk minimum in 
the Tatar Strait is above the northwest part of the 
Okhotsk Sea (Fig 4a).  The cold centers are l o-
cated there.  The Okhotsk minimum is extensive in 
extremal ice cover in winter (1979) in the Okhotsk 
Sea and the high - altitude ridge is not observed 
above western Kamchatka (Fig. 4).  The cold ce n-
ters are also located there.  
 
In low ice cover winters the Okhotsk minimum in 
the Japan Sea is substituted for a field of high 
p ressure.  For example, in 1991 and 1996 in the 
Okhotsk Sea the Okhotsk minimum shifts to co n-
tinental regions, and the Pacific ridge to the whole 
sea (Fig 4). The warm air masses are transferred to 
the northeastern part of the Okhotsk Sea, and a 
powerful ce nter of warmth is located there.  It is 
possible to assume that while a ridge of warmth 
stretches to the Okhotsk Sea, Pacific warm water 
inflow increases and it promotes an open water 
region to be larger.

tween the ice cover of the Okhotsk Sea and 
anomalies of geopotential H500 for Nikolaevsk -
on - Amur is equal ( r = – 0.46) (Fig. 5b). 
 
In 1990s there was a displacement of the climatic 
center of low pressure above the Okhotsk Sea 
which testifies to the variation of circulation 
mechanisms above the Far Eastern region.  In this 
connection, it is interesting to note t hat in the 
1990s processes such as El Niño (1991, 1994 – 95) 
took place which have found a response in the Far 
Eastern sector of the northern hem i sphere. 
Conclusions 
The comparison of ice cover changes in the Japan 
and Okhotsk Seas has shown a favourable cor rel a-
tion with changes of H500 structure.  Ice cover of 
these seas is a result of circulation processes above 
the Far Eastern region.  All low ice cover winters 
were observed when a high depression above the 
Okhotsk Sea was absent, which changed the tran s-
po rt of cold air masses to the Okhotsk Sea.  Weak 
ice cover in winter was observed in Tatar Strait 
when there was a sharp increase in pressure over 
the nort h ern part of the Japan Sea.

Introduction 
The ice cover of the seas is a product of the inte r-
action o f atmosphere and hydrosphere.  The reason 
for the appearance of ice is a decrease of te m per a-
ture of air.  Air temperature is also the basic infl u-
ence for the formation of ice cover in shallow seas.  
In deep - water seas (the Okhotsk Sea) the influence 
of hyd rological conditions in a number of cases 
can prevail above meteorological ones. The e x-
perience of the FERHRI forecasts shows that the 
correspondence between ice cover of the Okhotsk 
Sea and air temperature data is observed only in 
2/3 cases and success of the forecasts based only 
on meteorological factors does not e x ceed 70 – 80 
%.  This allows us to assume that ice cover is a f-
fected by other factors, in particular, hydrological 
conditions.  This is confirmed by numerical e x-
periments (Petrov and Frolov, 1980 ).  
 
In the present paper we analyze the relationship 
between the characteristics of ice cover in the Sea 
of Okhotsk and meteorological and hydrological 
cond i tions. 
Variations in the extent of ice cover by size and 
met e orological conditions 
For the variabi lity in the extent of ice cover, the 
diagram of the extent for 1962 – 1986 is co n-
structed (Fig. 1).  All range of variability is d i-
vided so that to the maximal size there corr e-
sponds to 100 (standardization on the maximal 
size in %), minimal to 0.  Such divi sion allows us 
to estimate better the conformity between size of 
ice cover of the sea and meteorological characte r-
istics (Fig. 2). 
 
For the effects of meteorological conditions we 
calculated the sums of average ten - day temper a-
tures of air from November thr ough March for the 
period from 1962 through 1986 for 18 meteor o-
logical stations located evenly along a perimeter of 
the Okhotsk Sea.  The resulting values characte r-
ize a temperature background of the winter season. 
The analysis of the diagrams shows that t he size of 
the ice cover and temperature background coincide 
in general.  The most interesting features are wi n-
ters with extreme (minimal and maximal) values 
of the extent of ice cover and air temperature. Let 
us consider the diagrams more in detail.  Here it is 
possible to classify the following winters accor d-
ing to Table 1. 
 
There are however, the winters in which an esse n-
tial discrepancy (20 and more %) between the size 
of an ice cover and meteorological conditions is 
found.  The most significant of them are summ a-
rized at Tables 2 and 3 and pr e sented in Figure 3. 
Variations in winters and hydrological      
conditions 
To relate winters and hydrological conditions data 
on the distribution of the characteristics of the cold 
intermediate layer (ICL) in the pr evious warm p e-
riod of year were used.  This layer of negative w a-
ter temperatures in its core is the basic feature of 
the Okhotsk Sea.  It is formed as a result of the r-
modynamic destruction of a  winter  homog e neous

layer, which is formed as a result of winter co n-
vection. The more ice is formed in the sea, the 
thicker the water layers cooled down to negative 
temperatures and the more area it o c cupies. 
 
ICL actively inf luences all thermodynamic pro c-
esses in the sea.  Among them it is possible to e x-
amine the influence of the ICL on an ice cover. 
The more extensive ICL is developed, the less the 
thermal content of the top active layer, and the 
more ice is formed with other conditions being 
equal. This given assumption used as a working 
hypothesis, which was confirmed by this work. 
 
As the most significant influence of the hydrolog i-
cal conditions on the ice cover, we examined ICL 
parameters in the central part of the Okhotsk Sea 
to the east of Sakhalin Island. 
 
First we constructed average long - term maps of 
the ICL characteristics based on all available hi s-
torical data for months, which had being chosen as 
an original definition of thermal conditions prior 
to each winter of t he studied period.  These are 
maps of the top and bottom borders of the layer 
with negative temperatures and its thickness. Maps 
for the period 1962 – 1986 were also constructed 
for July, August and September.  From further 
analysis it was supposed that the hydrological 
conditions are characterized by the presence of the 
ICL, namely, when the ICL is increased strongly, 
the hydrological conditions are assumed to be e x-
tremely cold, and in the opposite case – extremely 
warm (Fig. 4). 
Joint analysis of the charac teristics of winters

hydrolog i cal conditions 
We carried out a joint analysis of the extent of an 
ice cover, meteorological and hydrological cond i-
tions.  The results of the analysis are presented in

Conclusions 
It is necessary to note th at the qualitative analysis 
of conditions of the cold intermediate layer (in 
view of the lack of reliable and representative in i-
tial data) does not allow us to characterize the 
thermal condition of an active layer of the sea o b-
jectively and fully enough. H owever, from the o b-
tained results, in the absolute majority of cases the 
extent of an ice cover is completely defined only 
by appropriate combinations of meteorolog i cal 
and hydrological factors.  At strongly advanced 
ICL, the ice cover of the next winter i s frequently 
observed to be greater than that expected from 
meteorological conditions, and at a weaker state of 
the ICL, the ice extent is lower even under colder 
meteorological conditions. This conclusion is i m-
portant for using the characteristics of the cold 
intermediate layer for forecasting, and for research 
in connecting ice cover with meteorological p a-
rameters.  Frequently, when using the data on only 
ice extent, one might calculate various per i-
odic i ties caused by atmospheric circulation p a-
rameters (a nd by other factors) to try to explain 
their phys i cal meaning.  Taking into account h y-
drological factors can help researchers make more 
accurate statements regarding research problems, 
both for the ice cover studies directly and for other 
que s tions concern ing atmospheric circulation, and 
the climate as a whole.

This study is devoted to low - frequency variations 
of oceanographic and meteorological characteri s-
tics in the Sea of Okhotsk.  Time series of sea ice 
extent, air temperat ure at the meteorological st a-
tions around the Sea, South Oscillation Index 
(SOI), North Pacific Index (NPI), and of fr e-
quency of occurrence for certain meteorological 
situations were subjected to correlation and spe c-
tral analyses.  Monthly and seasonal (wi nter and 
summer) mean time series were considered for the 
periods of 40 years and more.  Both 3 - month (D e-
cember – February and June – August) and 5 - month 
(November – March and May – September) avera g-
ing was used to compose the seasonal time series. 
In a few cases, averaging was performed for 
April – June, July – September, October – December 
or January – March.  A 95% - confidence level was 
chosen to test statistical significance of estimates 
o b tained. 
 
Characteristic time - scales of low - frequency air 
temperature variations w ere obtained from power 
spectra for winter mean time series for the 20th 
century, often for more than 100 years.  We chose 
the 3 following intervals of interest in the time -
scale: biennial (2 – 3 years), ENSO (3 – 7 years), and 
decadal (7 – 13 years) intervals.  Every chosen time 
interval has, as a rule, the only max i mum of 95% -
significance level in spectra for monthly mean 
time series.  Typical examples are shown in Table 
1.  There are biennial maximums for the most st a-
tions in the most months.  ENSO - scale maxim ums 
occur usually in spring, rarer in summer or fall and 
almost never in winter.  On the contrary, decadal -
scale maximums are often present in winter, and, 
rarer, in fall.  
 
The situation is different from that in the Sea of 
Japan where ENSO - scale maximums are present 
in air temperature spectra for all seasons of a year, 
although both ENSO and decadal peaks usually do 
not occur simultaneously for the spectrum of the 
same month or season (Ponomarev et al., 1999). 
The spectrum for the Nemuro station (Table 1) 
which is actually located at the Hokkaido Pacific 
coast is close to those for the Japan Sea.  The pre s-
ence of well - pronounced ENSO and decadal scale 
variations in the subarctic area corresponds to 
findings based on analysis of North Pacific winter 
sea sur face temperature (Nakamura 1997; P o-
n o marev et al., 1999) as well as of the Oyashio 
Intr u sion and snow coverage over eastern Asia 
(Sekine, Yamada, 1996).  Thus, the relationship 
between seasonal air temperature anomalies and 
ENSO should be analyzed. 
 
Unlagg ed cross - correlation was estimated between 
winter mean time series of air temperature at the 
meteorological stations around the Sea of Okhotsk 
and SOI.  Lagged cross - correlation was estimated 
between winter mean air temperature and SOI for 
the previous (la g of – 6 months) or next (lag of +6 
months) summer.  A statistically significant pos i-
tive unlagged cross - correlation was found for st a-
tions located at the Sakhalin, Siberian and Ka m-
chatka coasts of the Okhotsk Sea.  A statistically 
significant positive lagg ed cross - correlation, air 
temperature lagging behind SOI (SOI taken for a 
previous summer), was also found, although 
smaller in value compared to the unlagged corr e l a-
tion.  Examples are shown in Table 2.  A chart of 
winter air temperature at the Ust - Hairuz ovo met e-
orological station located at the Kamchatka coast 
of the Okhotsk Sea superimposed with SOI and 
NPI is shown in Figure 1.  It also has unlagged and 
lagged (SOI leading 6 months) cross - correlations 
with SOI (Table 3).  
 
Air temperature at the norther n Okhotsk Sea shelf 
has an unlagged cross - correlation with SOI in a 
transitional fall – winter period from October to 
December (Table 4).  Moreover, it also has a 
lagged correlation with SOI averaged both for 
July – Se p tember and April – June. 
 
Thus, air tempera ture over the Sea of Okhotsk 
tends to have negative (positive) anomaly during 
winter El Niño (La Niña) events.  Likewise, air 
  
 32
temperature over the Sea tends to have positive 
anomaly in winters following summer La Niña 
events.  This conclusion, however, is not valid for 
some southern coastal Okhotsk Sea stations.  As 
seen in Table 2, the Nemuro and Abashiri stations 
situated at the northeast Hokkaido coast do not 
have a statistically significant correlation with 
SOI, or with the most northern coastal station s in 
the O k hotsk Sea (Okhotsk and Magadan). 
 
Low - frequency thermal regime variations also 
manifest themselves in the Okhotsk Sea ice.  Sea 
ice winter mean time series (1957 – 1989) were 
composed by averaging 10 - day ice cover in winter 
and early spring (21 – 28 of February, 1 – 10, 11 – 20 
and 21 – 30 of March, and 1 – 10 of April).  Both its 
unlagged and lagged (ice 6 months lagging SOI) 
cross - correlation with SOI is statistically signif i-
cant and negative (Table 3, Fig. 2).  Thus, ice 
cover in the Okhotsk Sea tends to increase during 
winter El Niño events (when SOI reaches its hig h-
est negative values) and to decrease in winters fo l-
lowing summer La Niña events (when SOI reaches 
its highest positive va l ues). 
 
As a whole, seasonal links between ENSO and 
oceanographic and m eteorological characteristics 
suggest winter cooling in the Sea of Okhotsk du r-
ing winter El Niño events and winter warming 
there after prev i ous summer La Niña events.

Fig. 2 Time series (1957 – 1989) of the Sea of Okhotsk ice extent normalized anomaly (1) and norma l-
ized winter anomaly of SOI (2).  (Positive values of SOI correspond to La Niña events, negative values 
corr e spond to El Niño events.) 
 
 
NPI measuring intensity of Aleutian Low also has 
statistical ly significant positive unlagged cross -
correlation with SOI for winter.  In winter, NPI 
also has positive lagged cross - correlation with SOI 
taken for a previous summer (Table 3).  Figure 1  
shows that NPI varies in phase with air temper a-
ture at the Ust - Hai ruzovo meteorological station.  
At the same time, NPI spectra calculated for 
monthly mean time series in summer have a d e-
cadal spectral maximum, which is also present in 
the winter time series of air temperature over the 
Sea of Okhotsk.  The Okhotsk Sea ic e extent 
shows a decadal maximum in the spectrum as well 
(Plo t nikov, 1997). 
 
It was earlier shown that the ENSO cycle is a c-
companied by South Asian Monsoon anomalies 
(Webster and Yang, 1992; Sekine, 1996) and by a 
change in the jet stream and the associate d storm 
tracks which, in turn, alters the heat and vorticity 
fluxes caused by the transient eddies over the 
Northern Hemisphere (Branstator, 1995).  Ther e-
fore, it is reasonable to suggest that ENSO and 
decadal scale variations in the Sea of Okhotsk are 
con nected via both annual – biennial oscillations of 
the Asian monsoon system and ocean – atmosphere 
interaction in the western mid - latitude P a cific. 
 
Palmer et al. (1992) and Molteni et al. (1993) a r-
gued that, despite very large natural variability of 
the extrat ropical atmosphere circulation, there e x-
ist certain preferred regimes with rather persistent 
flow patterns presumably associated with the 
land – sea distribution and climatological planetary 
waves.  The effect of tropical sea surface te m per a-
ture forcing asso ciated with the ENSO cycle alters 
the frequency of occurrence and stability of certain 
pre - existing regimes ( Learning to Predict Climate 
Variations Associated with El Niño and Southern 
Oscillation. Accomplishments and Leg a cies of the 
TOGA Pr o gram , 1996).  
 
Polyakova (1997) suggested six typical synoptic 
patterns of atmospheric circulation over the North 
Pacific based on heuristic analysis of daily sea 
surface pressure fields with a special consideration 
of positions of cyclone tracks and of the Aleutian 
Low and Subtropic High pressure centers.  Choice 
of original pressure fields rather than averaged, for 
example, monthly data, gave patterns which keep 
   
  35
information on synoptic processes. They were ea r-
lier described in detail (Ponomarev et al., 1999), 
and simi larity were emphasized over the North 
Pacific with known atmospheric circulation pa t-
terns such as the Pacific – North American (PNA), 
East – West (EW), and Zonal Dipole (ZD) patterns 
(Wallace and Gutzler, 1981; Barnston and 
Livezey, 1987).  The calendar develo ped by 
Polyakova (1997) for the period from 1949 to 
1998 reflects alternation of these patterns in time 
and is hereafter used as a base for composing 
monthly time series of their frequency of occu r-
rence in days per month. 
 
Considering low - frequency variati ons of ocean o-
graphic and meteorological characteristics in the 
Sea of Okhotsk, two most frequent meteorological 
situations are of particular interest (Polyakova, 
1997; Ponomarev et al., 1999).  They are the O k-
hotsk – Aleutian and Cyclones Over North Pacific 
situations (Figs. 3 and 4).  The Okhotsk – Aleutian 
(OA) situation (Fig. 3) represents the classical m e-
ridional dipoles with a high pressure ridge over the 
central Pacific from the Subtropics to the Subar c-
tic and low pressure over the eastern and western 
Pac ific. Northward tracks of southern cyclones 
dominate over the western and eastern Pacific 
Ocean.  As for the western Pacific, cyclones come 
from the Philippine Sea through the Kuroshio – Oyashio area to the Kuril adjacent to the Pacific, 
Japan and O k hotsk Se as.  
 
Figure 5 shows OA normalized annual frequency 
of occurrence.  The biennial variations are clearly 
seen on the plot, and they are also typical for all 
six types.  The estimated polynomial trend also 
shows interdecadal oscillations with the period of 
a bout 30 years.  
 
To reveal ENSO - scale variations, a cross -
correlation was estimated between OA and CN 
frequency of occurrence and SOI time series.  As 
oscillations are present for different time - scales, 
correlation coefficients should not be high.  In 
fact , we had to try various sub - samples of the 
1949 – 1998 time series to obtain the best correl a-
tion with SOI. Some examples are shown in Table 
5.  Nevertheless, positive unlagged correlation was 
found between OA occurrence and SOI in June 
and November.  This m eans that the OA situation 
occurs more often when SOI reaches its highest 
positive values during the La Niña event in June or 
in Nove m ber.  
 
Cross - correlation of the OA situation occurrence 
was estimated with monthly mean air temperature 
at the meteorologi cal stations around the Sea of 
Okhotsk.  Both unlagged and lagged, with air te m-
perature lagging one month behind OA, correl a-
tion coefficients were calculated.  As shown in 
Table 6, all coefficients are positive, that is, the 
OA situation is warm for the Se a in fall, winter 
and spring.  So, the OA situation, meridional for

the whole North Pacific, corresponds to penetr a-
tion of southern cyclones with characteristic 
weather patterns to the Northwest Pacific Margin 
and, in particular, over the Sea of Okhotsk.  Pos i-
tive correlation of OA occurrence with SOI means 
that decreased southern cyclones cool the Okhotsk 
Sea during El Niño events in fall or increased 
southern cyclones warm the Sea in fall after su m-
mer La Niña events. 
 
The Cyclones Over the North Pacific (CN) syno p-
tic situation (Fig. 4) is characterized by a meri d-
i onal circulation pattern in the eastern Pacific with 
the western positi on of the Subtropic High Pre s-
sure, northward cyclone tracks over the Eastern 
Pacific, and eastward tracks over the Central and 
Western Pacific between latitudes of 40° – 50°N.  
To the north of 50°N, cold air comes over the O k-
hotsk  Sea  from  the  Bering Sea and Siberia.  The  
 
 
   
  37
CN occurrence has negative unlagged correlation 
with with SOI for March, April, May, October and 
November (Table 5).  Therefore, it occurs more 
often in spring and fall during El Niño events.  
The CN situation is cold for the Sea o f Okhotsk in 
winter and spring as estimated cross - correlation 
with air temperature around the Sea shows (Table 
7). So, increased occurrence of the CN situation in 
spring during El Niño events tends to cool the Sea.  
A plot of CN normalized annual mean freq uency 
of occurrence (Fig. 6) shows typical biennial 
vari a tions as well as multiannual peaks.  Avera g-
ing intervals between corresponding maximums 
which took place in 1950, 1958, 1970, 1985, and 
1992 gives a period of 10 years, that is, decadal 
oscill a tions.

It is worth noting that the occurrence of the rare 
Southern - Zonal (SZ) situation seems to be related 
to the ENSO cycle.  The SZ situation (Fig. 7) co r-
responds to a zonal dipole with high pressure over 
the Bering Sea and Alaska, extreme southern p o s i-
tion of the subarctic low pressure system, eas t ward 
c yclone tracks in the subtropic Pacific area, and 
northeastward cyclone tracks over the subar c tic 
eastern Pacific.  The SZ situation may not o c curs 
at all during periods from few months to 2 – 3 years 
but, when it does occur, its duration (10 – 20 days) 
is comp arable with the duration of frequent situ a-
tions like the OA and CN ones (Fig. 8).  The SZ 
situation shows increased occurrence between 
typical ENSO cycles and huge occurrence in the 
1 – 2 years before strong El - Niño events, partic u-
larly before winters of 195 7 – 1958, 1972 – 1973, 
1982 – 1983 and 1997 – 1998 (Fig. 8).  As a whole, 
the highest SZ occurrence was observed in 1953, 
1957, 1962 – 1963, 1968, 1971, 1972, 1974, 1977, 
1979, 1981, 1985, 1989, 1993, and 1996 – 1997, 
which gives a mean period of 3.2 years consistent 
with the ENSO cycle.  The SZ situation lasted 24 
days in August 1996, its maximum occurrence 
during 1949 – 1998 (Fig. 8).  
 
Thus, El Niño (La Niña) - accompanying processes 
in the Northwest Pacific result in cooling (war m -

Introduction
Poezzhalova and Shevchenko (1997a, b) found
significant seasonal and interannual sea level
changes in the area of the Kuril Ridge.  They also
detected strong sea level trends probably assoc i -
ated with vertical ground motions.  The purpose of
the present paper is to verify these findings and to
investigate long-term variations of some other
meteorological parameters which probably infl u -
ence sea level changes.  It was also interesting to
estimate possible effect of the 1997 El Niño on the
northwestern part of the Pacific Ocean.  The series
of monthly means of atmospheric pressure, air and
water temperatures from 4 meteorological stations
were analyzed to estimate various statistical cha r -
acteristics (mean and extreme values, standard
errors, etc.) for every month and for all stations.
The stations were located in the area of Kuril
Ridge: Shumshu ( Shumshu Island), Simushir ( S i -
mushir Island), Kurilsk ( Iturup Island), and Yu z -
hno-Kurilsk ( Kunashir Island) (Fig. 1).

We used the least square method to calculate the
amplitudes and phases of these harmonics.  The
results of this analysis are pr e sented in Table 1.
The amplitudes of the annual oscillations of the
atmospheric pressure are rather small in the area of
the South Kuril Islands but quite significant in the
area of the North Kuril Islands.  These results are
in good agreement with the results of sea level
analysis made by Poezzhalova and Shevchenko
(1997a, b):  The sea level amplitudes of the Sa
harmonic for the former region were considerably
smaller than for the latter (5 and 10 cm, respe c -
tively).
Seasonal sea level and atmospheric pressure o s -
cillations are approximately in antiphase , max i -
mum sea level heights correspond to minimum
atmospheric pressure, and vice versa.  Normally,
these maximum sea levels and minimum pressure
are observed in December or January and are a s -
sociated with influence of the Aleutian Low.
However, these seasonal variations of sea level
cannot be described by the simple “inverted b a -
rometer law”.  The Sa sea level amplitudes are
approximately twice as large as those of the a t -
mospheric pressure .  We may assume that there
are some additional oceanic and atmospheric fa c -
tors influencing seasonal sea level vari a tions.
The Sa (annual) harmonic strongly dominates in

the variations of air and sea surface temperatures
(95–98% of the total variance).  Maximum ampl i -
tudes of this harmonic, both for air (AT) and sea
surface (SST) temperatures, occur near Kunashir
Island (southern part of the Kuril Ridge) and
minimum amplitudes are observed in the vicinity
of Simushir Island (central part of the Kuril
Ridge).  In general, the seasonal changes of SST
are relatively small, apparently due to the su p -
pressing influence of the Pacific Ocean water
masses.  The annual changes of SST and sea level
are in antiphase.  Probably, rather strong seasonal
sea level oscillations in the area of the Kuril Ridge
are determined by the changes in ocean circulation
in the Northwest Pacific induced by the large-scale
atmospheric fluctuations (such effect is well
known for the Northeast Pacific (cf. Emery and
Hamilton, (1985))).

The mean annual values of meteorological p a -
rameters were used to estimate respective
multiyear averaged values and linear trends.  The
coefficients of the linear trends were calculated by
the least square method.  These coefficients for the
atmospheric pressure are –0.030 and 0.022
mbar/ yr at stations Yuzhno-Kurilsk and Kurilsk,
and negligibly small at Shumshu and Simushir
(Fig. 2).  This means that the interannual changes
of the atmospheric pressure cannot induce sea
level drift with coefficients of about 0.4–0.6 cm/ yr
observed in the area of the Kuril Islands ( Yak u -
shko et al., 1982; Poezzhalova and Shevchenko , 1997b).
The air temperature increased slowly with time
(except Shumshu), the regressional coefficients
ranged from 0.0055   C/ yr ( Yuzhno-Kurilsk) to
0.019   C/ yr ( Kurilsk).  The multiyear mean values
were from 1.8   C ( Shumshu) to 4.8   C ( Yu z hno-
Kurilsk) (Fig. 3.).
The sea surface temperature had the opposite te n -
dency ,  the  linear  trend coefficients ranged from
–0.001   C/ yr ( Simushir) to –0.0078   C/ yr ( Yuzhno-
Kurilsk); the mean values at these stations were
2.3 and 6.7   C, respectively.  The coldest month
weather was observed in 1967, the warmest in
1990–1991.  The direct effects of the 1982 or 1997
El Niño are not evident in the area of the Kuril
Islands.
We calculated also the coefficients of the linear
trends for different seasons using seasonal (3-
month) averaged values of air temperature (Table
2).  In this way we got more interesting results.
Thus, the air temperature for all stations (also, e x -
cept Shumshu) relatively fast increased for winter
seasons with the coefficients of about 0.02–
0.034   C/ yr and somewhat weaker for fall seasons
(0.015–0.02   C/ yr).  Probably, this effect is the r e -
sult of the global climate warming.  In contrast,
sea surface temperature for some stations notice a -
bly decreased from year to year: at Yuzhno-
Kurilsk for summer seasons (for about 1.5   C du r -
ing the period of observations), and at Kurilsk for
fall seasons (Fig. 4).  Unfortunately, we could not
calculate SST linear trends at Simushir and Shu m -
shu because the corresponding data had too many
gaps.

Spatial variability of the wind field in the area of the Kuril Islands
George V. SHEVCHENKO and Vladimir Yu. Saveliev Institute of Marine Geology and Geophysics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Ru s sia
Introduction
Examination of time and spatial variability of
wind field is important for various applied pro b -
lems. In particular, the problem of evaluation and
development of wind power stations recently b e -
came crucial for the region of the Kuril Islands.
Climatic characteristics of wind presented in ge n -
erally used manuals (Climate Guide, 1969; K o -
shinsky, 1978; Pacific Ocean, 1966) are mainly
based on wind data obtained by weather vanes.
Since the end of the 1970s more precise instr u -
ments have begun to be used to measure wind at
meteorological stations of the former USSR.  Pr e -
liminary analysis of old and modern data showed
significant difference of the corresponding est i -
mates.  The purpose of the present work is to e x -
amine the spatial structure and to obtain some cl i -
matic characteristics of the wind field in the
vicinity of the Kuril Islands based on the modern
wind data.
Observational data
For analysis we used 10-min averaged wind data
from stations Shumshu, Matua, Simushir and
Shikotan, located on the corresponding islands,
and from station Kurilsk, located on Iturup Island,
for the period 1966–1984, prepared at the World
Data Center at Obninsk, Russia.  The location of
the meteorological stations is shown in Figure 1.
We chose stations Shumshu and Shikotan rather
than the nearby stations Severo-Kurilsk on Par a -
mushir Island and Yuzhno-Kurilsk on Kunashir
Island, for the reason that the former pair is less
influenced by the local orography than the latter.
The analysis of the data has revealed their esse n -
tial heterogeneity, much of the information before
1980 pertaining to measurements executed by
weather vanes.  For a more detailed examination
we used a series for 1980–1984, since these data
had no gaps and were obtained by the same type of
instr u ment, an anemorumbometer M-63M.

Shumshu and Shikotan rather than the nearby st a -
tions Severo-Kurilsk ( Paramushir Island) and
Yuzhno-Kurilsk ( Kunashir Island) since the wind
at the former pair is less influenced by the local
orography than at the latter.  The analysis of the
data has revealed their essential heterogeneity,
much of the information before 1980 pertaining to
measurements executed by weather vanes.  So, for
more detailed examination we used series for
1980–1984 since all these data were made by the
same type of the instrument ( anemorumbometer
M-63M) and had no gaps.
Recurrence of the wind by directions and speed
grad a tions
Figure 2 presents diagrams illustrating the wind
distribution by directions and speed gradations.
There are two maxima in the distribution of the
wind speed: the main maximum corresponding to
the typical wind speed of 2–4 m/s (3–5 m/s at
Shumshu), and a secondary maximum at 10–12
m/s.  Such character of speed distribution remains

basically the same for all stations and all seasons.
However, in winter, when winds are normally
stronger, the second maximum intensifies and the
main maximum becomes weaker; the opposite
tendency is observed in summer.
The “wind roses” (Fig. 2) demonstrate noticeable
spatial variability of wind directions.  Northwes t -
erly winds prevail at all stations, however the
other features are different for different stations.
Thus, in the vicinity of Shumshu Island winds
from directions other than northwest are weak and
infrequent.  In contrast, near Matua Island nort h -
erly winds are observed frequently, for Kurilsk
easterly winds are rather frequent, for Simushir
southeasterly, and for the area of Shikotan Island
southerly winds occur quite often.
The dominant northwesterly winds are a typical
autumn-winter feature for the whole area of the
Sea of Okhotsk (so-called “winter monsoon”, r e -
lated to the influence of the Aleutian Low).  The
corresponding spatial distribution of the sea su r -
face atmospheric pressure in the area of Okhotsk
Sea is shown in the Figure 3a.  In the spring-
summer period the air streams near the Kuril I s -
lands are apparently not so stable, resulting in the
variety of the winds from the other directions o b -
served in this period. (Figure 3b presents a typical
distribution of atmospheric pressure in summer.)
That means that the wind field in this area cannot
be satisfactorily described by a simple layout:  The
winter monsoon with northwesterly winds is r e -
placed by the summer monsoon with southeasterly
winds (P a cific Ocean, 1966).
It is interesting to note that the wind velocities
near the Kuril Islands are found to be weaker than
is usually assumed: according to Climate Guide
(1969) extreme wind velocities in this region are
up to 50 m/s.  Results of the present examination
of wind data for the period 1970–1984 showed
that none of the five analyzing stations recorded
wind velocities exceeding 30 m/s.  The total
amount of the cases with wind exceeding 20 m/s is
rather insignificant, from 0.4% at Matua up to
2.5% at Simushir.  These extreme winds with
speed up to 28–30 m/s are mainly observed in
March or in October and November (Fig. 4a).  The
strongest winds have northwesterly direction for
the southern and central parts of the Kuril Islands,
southwesterly at Matua, and northeasterly at
Shumshu.  These months correspond to the time of
the major cyclonic activity in this area.  The distr i -
bution of the extreme wind shows that the corr e -
sponding cyclones cross the chain of the Kuril I s -
lands just in the center, near Matua Island.

the major cyclonic activity in this area.  The distr i -
bution of the extreme wind shows that the corr e -
sponding cyclones cross the chain of the Kuril I s -
lands just in the center, near Matua Island.
The complicated picture of maximum winds is
observed in summer. Extreme wind speeds are
about 17–25 m/s, the direction of maximum winds
varies siginicantly from year to year, except at
Shumshu where northwesterly winds are dom i -
nant, and from station to station.  Typhoons which
are coming from the tropical Pacific into the area
of the Kuril Islands in summer and early fall are
probably the reason for destabilizing atmospheric
circulation and producing storm winds of various
dire c tions.
Monthly mean winds
Spatial and temporal variability of monthly mean
winds averaged over 5 years (1980–1984) is
clearly seen in Figure 4b.  The primary feature of
the wind field is the very strong seasonal change
of wind velocity. In the cold season (October–
March) mean winds are sufficiently strong and
steady.  For the whole area of the Kuril Islands,
they have northwesterly direction; variations from
station to station are insignificant.  In contrast, in
the warm season (April–September), mean winds
are much weaker and there is essential difference
between the two northernmost stations Shumshu
and Matua and the others.  At stations Shikotan
and Kurilsk in the South Kuril Islands, winds
change direction to the southerly and

logical stations in the area of the Kuril Islands.
53
the southerly and southeasterly, i.e. the wind field
takes the character typical for summer monsoon.
A similar picture but not so evident is observed
also at Simushir.  At the same time, monthly mean
winds of northwesterly and westerly direction pr e -
vail at Matua and Shumshu.  The seasonal changes
at these stations are manifested mainly in the
variations of the velocity magnitude rather than in
the direction.  This character of seasonal variabi l -
ity of monthly mean wind velocities is in good
agreement with the spatial distribution of atmo s -
pheric pressure in the area of the Sea of Okhotsk
(Fig. 3).  Probably, a local area of high atmo s -
pheric pressure observed in summer time over the
Kamchatka Peninsula influences winds near the
North Kuril Islands, causing the difference from
the winds in the area of the South Kuril I s lands.
We estimated the relation between the variance of
the average group values (factorial variance) and
the average of the group variances (casual var i -
ance), showing the stability of the performance.
We found that contribution of the factorial var i -
ance is about 70–80% of the total variance except
for the east-going (zonal) component of the wind
at Matua and Shumshu stations.  Seasonal changes
of this zonal component of the wind are weak in
the area of the Northern Kuril I s lands.
Conclusions
The main conclusions of the present analysis are
as fo l lows:
• The maximum wind velocities in the area of
the Kuril Islands were found to be up to 30
m/s, i.e. significantly smaller than it was a s -
sumed according to well-known reference
guides mainly based on obsolete weather vane
mea s urements.
• In winter, significant northwesterly winds a s -
sociated with the Aleutian Low prevail in the
area of the Kuril Islands (“winter monsoon”);
however there are noticeable differences in
distribution of wind directions (“roses of
winds”) for various stations.
• In summer, winds are weaker and not stable
resulting in the variety of the winds from di f -
ferent directions.  A simple model of “summer
monsoon” cannot describe summer circulation
for the whole area of the Kuril Islands.  In fact,
there is a boundary between the Simushir and
Matua Islands (i.e. in the central part of the
Kuril Islands) dividing zones with different
character of prevailing winds: northwesterly
for the northern stations and southerly to
southeasterly for the southern stations.

Introduction  
The data obtai ned from four surveys undertaken in 
the northern part of the Okhotsk Sea in March – September 1997 (about 900 CTD stations) were 
an a lyzed. 
 
The interest in the monitoring experiments carried 
out by TINRO in the Okhotsk Sea grows consi d-
erably at the present t ime because of discussions 
of the new “cold” period.  The beginning of this 
cold period was predicted by heliomagnetic cycles 
happening in the early 1990s  (Davydov, 1984) or 
in the late 1990s (Shuntov, 1985).  Shuntov pu b-
lished data on the reorganization of the southern 
Okhotsk Sea biota and described the same ph e-
nomenon observed both with the sea birds and 
animals (Shuntov, 1994; Shuntov and Dulepova, 
1996).  In Shuntov’s opinion, these factors were 
caused by the beginning of a cooling period.  The 
oceano logical conditions of recent years up to 
1997 in the northern part of the Okhotsk Sea does 
not confirm this assertion. 
Results and discussion 
It is known that the severity of winter conditions 
has significant influence on water structure and 
temperature of the northern part of the Okhotsk 
Sea in the layer 0 – 200 m.  According to our data, 
the correlation of the sea - ice cove r maximum with 
water temperature in spring in different sites of the 
shelf  is characterized by  the  negative  ratio  R = 
– 0.65 to – 0.80.  The temperature anomaly in i n-
termediate cold waters remains as long as the b e-
ginning of new winter convection, at a probability 
of 60 – 70%.  According to the data obtained by 
Chernyavsky (1992) for the period from 1954 to 
1986, the waters with minimal temperature, gene r-
ated by winter convection in summer are usually 
divided into four subsurface cold “cores” (te m-
perature £ – 1   C).  These are the North - Okhotsk 
and East - Sakhalin large cold cores, the Shelikhov 
Bay core and small cold cores off West Ka m-
chatka.  The cold core water with a temperature of 
£ – 1   C has higher salinity and density and shows 
cyclonic circulation in th e dynamic topography 
charts.  The large - scale cyclonic circulation is 
regularly formed around the North - Okhotsk cold 
core.  The wes t ward current, named the North -
Okhotsk Current, and the opposite eastward cu r-
rent, named the North - Okhotsk Counter Current, 
t ogether with the northward flow, called the West -
Kamchatka Current (WKC), were observed on the 
borders of the North - Okhotsk cold core. The var i-
ability of size and position of the cyclones depend 
largely on the cold core seasonal changes, as seen 
on monthly averaged current charts, drafted by 
Luchin (1987) (Fig. 1). 
 
A low - ice situation was observed in the Okhotsk 
Sea after the period 1980 – 1983.  In the winters of 
1996 and 1997, there was an unusual decrease in 
ice cover – down to 25 – 35%.  In April 1997 the

Shelikhov Bay was 0.28 – 0.20 · 10

Compensatory Current water along the West 
Kamchatka coast was observed only within 
57°50 ¢ – 56°30 ¢N in April and between 56°20 ¢ 0 – 55°00 ¢N in July. 
 
Recent investigations show a significant reduction 
of the cold co re areas. In April 1997, the area with 
the lowest water temperature of £ – 1 °C covered 
less than 6% of the total area along West Ka m-
chatka, whereas the average value for 1983 – 1997 
was equal to 41%.  In May 1997 the cold core area 
in Shelikhov Bay was equal t o 39%, compared to 
the average value of 69%.  The largest and stable 
North - Okhotsk cold core usually covered the ave r-
age annual area of 191 – 23 · (10

160 – 22 · (10

) in October (in the eastern area 
to 146°E, 1954 – 1986 according to Chernyavsky’s 
(1992) observations, and 1987 – 1997 according to 
our records).  In May 1997, the North - Okhotsk 
cold core area covered about 75,000 km
2
, which 
was e qual to the October - averaged parameters.  In 
July 1997, the North - Okhotsk cold core spread 
over an area of about 38,500 km

 and decreased to 
as low as 1,300 km

 in September (Fig.3).  Its 
eastern border shifted westward from 151° – 152°E 
in August to 146° – 14 8   E in September. 
 
The WKC midstream moved in a similar manner.  
Its northward water transport in the 0 – 200 m layer 
varied from 0.45 · 10

/s in September.  The usually zonally or i e n-
tated North - Okhotsk Current and its counter -
current were not observed.  Due to strong cold 
core destruction, geostrophic currents of the North 
Okhotsk Sea in July of 1997 were similar to the 
currents that were usually formed only in Septe m-
ber – October as an annual average (Fig. 1c).  The 
most abnorm al phenomenon was the formation of 
the northward flow to the Okhotsk Sea near 143° – 145°E (Fig. 2c).  This flow was the North - Okhotsk 
counter - current which had this unique location and 
direction due to the abnormal rise of total heat 
content in the northern Okhotsk shelf waters in 
1997. 
 
Moreover, the following factors may also be of 
importance: 
 
(1) Shelf water bottom salinity at the 100 – 200 m 
isobath dropped by 0.1 – 0.2 psu from May to 
September (Fig. 4).  A more significant d e-
cline of the water salinity was ob served in the 
coastal waters and in the upper layer.  The s a-
linity in the “cold halocline” has decreased 
compared with the data of 1996.  The general 
salinity level of the North Okhotsk Sea has 
decreased as well compared with the annual 
average salinity. 
 
(2) In August the shifting of the eastern border of 
the North - Okhotsk cold core to the Kashev a-
rov Bank area caused a significant intensific a-
tion of cyclonic circul a tion over the Bank. 
 
(3) In spring 1997, the water transport of the 
West - Kamchatka Current to the no rthern O k-
hotsk shelf was the strongest for the past 10 
years.  During the summer, the width of the 
northern flow doubled, but the total transport 
remained almost unchanged.

Ventilation of the upper portion of the intermediate water in the Okhotsk Sea

Introduction 
Processes determining the ventilation of inte rm e-
diate water in the North Pacific continue to be of 
interest, since in the intermediate layer the acc u-
mulation and redistribution of carbon dioxide and 
other gases connected with the greenhouse effect 
might occur. The direct ventilation of intermediate 
w ater occurs only in limited regions of the Nort h-
west Pacific, including the Okhotsk Sea.  The 
cold, low salinity and high oxygen intermediate 
layer in the Okhotsk Sea differs greatly from the 
relatively warm, saline and low - oxygen intermed i-
ate waters in th e adjacent North Pacific.  Ther e-
fore, these waters are considered as the most si g-
nificant source for ventilation in the North Pacific 
(Talley, 1991; Talley and Nagata, 1995; Yasuda, 
1997; Kono and Kawasaki, 1997). 
 
The candidates for primary mechanisms tha t d e-
termine direct ventilation and transformation of 
the intermediate water in the Okhotsk Sea include 
the following processes (Moroshkin, 1966; Kitani, 
1973; Talley and Nagata, 1995; Watanabe and 
Wakatsuchi, 1998): 
 
1. Formation in winter of brine - enriched D ense 
Shelf Water (DSW) through surface cooling 
and freezing in the northern coastal pol y nyas;  
 
2. Spring inflow of dense Soya Current Water 
(SCW) through the Laperuz (Soya) Strait; 
 
3. Convection due to winter cooling.  
 
Under the influence of these processes, the vent i l a-
tion of the upper portion of the intermediate w a ters 
in the Okhotsk Sea (potential density 26.7 – 27.1 
s
q
, depths from 150 to 400 – 700 m) takes place. 
Moroshkin (1966) named this water mass as the 
Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water  (OSIW).  
 
This pape r describes the ventilation signatures in 
the upper portion of the intermediate water in the 
Okhotsk Sea.  Temperature, salinity and potential 
vorticity Q on isopycnal surfaces are analyzed.  
We also discuss the oceanographic features related 
to DSW outflo w along the east coast of Sakhalin 
Island and background conditions for convection 
in the Soya Current region near the South Kuril 
Islands. 
Data  
CTD observations were carried out on board the 
R/V Akademik M.A.Lavrentyev in July – September 
1994.  The locati on of stations is shown in Figure 
1.  A Neil Brown Mark IIIB CTD was used.  The 
CTD data were collected to 1000 m.  Conductivity 
data were calibrated by bottle samples with an a c-
curacy of 0.01 psu in salinity. CTD data were a v-
eraged to 1 - dbar intervals. 
Di stribution of temperature, salinity and       
potential vorticity on isopycnal surfaces 
To investigate how ventilated water is distributed 
in the Okhotsk Sea, we carried out analyses of 
temperature, salinity and potential vorticity Q 
within the OSIW densit y range.  To calculate the 
potential vorticity along isopycnals properties in 
the 26.8 – 26.9 and 27.0 – 27.1 s
q
 ranges were used. 
 
The distribution of temperature and salinity (Fig. 
2) along isopycnal 26.8 s
q
 shows the following 
features.  The warmest and mos t saline waters 
were observed in the northeast part of the Kuril 
Basin.  The OSIW in this region is transformed by 
mixing with Pacific water which flows through the 
Kruzenshtern Strait.  The second area of warm and 
salty waters were observed off the west c oast of 
the southern Kuril Islands.  The surface layer of 
this area was occupied by the warmest and salty 
SCW.  The coldest and freshest waters connected 
with DSW were observed along the east coast of 
Sakhalin Island.  In the Kuril Basin spotty distr i-
b u tio n of the temperature and salinity related to 
the presence of mesoscale eddies was observed.  
The map of dynamic topography (Fig. 3) clearly 
shows two anticyclonic eddies.  The eddy A1 had 
a cold, fresh core between isopycnals 26.7 – 26.9 
s
q
.  For eddy A2 the water between 26.7 – 26.9 s
q
 
was warmer and more saline than in the su r roun d-
ings.  Mesoscale eddies are often observed in the 
Okhotsk Sea (Wakatsuchi and Martin, 1990).

Development and decay of eddies in the Kuril B a-
sin can be determined by the surface flow of 
warm, saline Soya Current Water, the advection of 
cold, less saline water from the East Sakhalin 
shelf, and winter cooling and convective mixi ng 
(Wakatsuchi and Martin, 1991). 
 
 Isopycnal layer thickness, which is locally related 
to potential vorticity defined as Q = r
– 1
 f Dr/ Dz 
(10
– 11
 m
– 1
/s
– 1
), is a useful property to study of the 
distribution and circulation of the ventilated water 
mass.  Vent ilated water can be identified by using 
potential vorticity minimum (Talley and McCar t-
ney, 1982). 
 
 According to Freeland et al. (1996) and Yusuda 
(1997), the vertical distribution of potential vo r ti c-
ity in the Okhotsk Sea has a minimum centered at 
26.8 – 26 .9 s
q
 and a layer of the second max i mum 
Q located between isopycnals 27.0 and 27.1 s
q
.  
These results suggest that OSIW is a vent i lated 
water mass in the Okhotsk Sea. 
 
A vertical section of Q (Fig. 4) shows that the low 
potential vorticity layer related to OSIW was o b-
served in the whole deep part of the Okhotsk Sea.  
The local minima Q were connected with a core of 
antic y clonic eddies.  
 
In the layer 26.8 – 26.9 s
q
 (Fig. 5a), which corr e-
sponds to a minimum of potential vorticity (vent i-
lated regime) high - Q wat er ( Q > 8) was observed 
along the Kuril Islands and along the east coast of 
Sakhalin Island.  These are regions with less ve n t i-
lated (more stratified) water of the intermediate 
layer.  Thus DSW outflows along the east coast of 
Sakhalin Island can be charac terized as high - Q 
water.  It is possible to identify two areas of inte r-
mediate - Q water with 6 < Q < 7, one of which is 
connected to waters with a strong Pacific comp o-

nent flowing through the Kruzenshtern Strait; the 
second is located near the Terpeniya Bay .  E n-
hanced vertical mixing in these areas results in the 
reduction of Q .  The minima of Q (4 – 5) related to 
anticyclonic eddies were observed in the Kuril 
Basin.  This shows that processes of generation 
and decay of these eddies can be related to 
py c no s tad formation in the O k hotsk Sea. 
The potential vorticity distribution along 27.0 – 27.1 s
q
 (Fig. 5b, potential vorticity maximum) 
shows the region of high - Q water extending from 
the Kruzenshtern Strait to the Deryugin Basin.  
Low - Q water with Q from 6 to 9 w as distributed 
along the central and southern Kuril Islands and 
near Terpeniya Cape.  The formation process of 
this low - Q water may be associated with boundary 
mixing.  Also, the low - Q band was found in the 
Kuril Basin.  
Dense shelf water along the East Sa khalin        
I s land coast  
DSW is formed in winter in the northern coastal 
polynyas (Kitani, 1973; Alfultis and Martin, 
1987). DSW can also be formed in Shelikhov Bay 
and on the East Sakhalin shelf, including Te r-
peniya Bay.  Dense water is advected from t he 
northwestern shelf to Cape Elizabeth (the northern 
tip of Sakhalin Island).  DSW was observed off 
Cape Elizabeth as the cold bottom layer between 
isobaths 70 and 130 m (Fig. 6). Potential density 
in the bottom layer ranged from 26.94 to 27.02 s
q
.  
Over the East Sakhalin shelf (bottom depths 60 – 200 m) the bottom cold layer had potential dens i-
ties of 26.71 – 26.85 s

Sakhalin Island slope potential density near the 
bottom ranged from 26.85 – 26.94 s
q
.  This shows 
that DSW can ventilate the i ntermediate water at 
least down to isopycnal 27.02 s
q
. 
 
The outflowing DSW spreads along the east coast 
of Sakhalin Island.  During its movement the 
DSW mixes with ambient waters.  The renewed 
waters separate from the Sakhalin Island coast 
near Terpeniya Cape and move into the Kuril B a-
sin.  Due to interleaving, numerous cold intrusive 
layers (lenses) are formed which appear on the 
vertical profiles as secondary minima of temper a-
ture.  In Figure 7 the characteristics of the seco n-
dary minima of temperature in the region located 
between the east coast of Sakhalin Island and 
147   E are shown.  The cold layers had a temper a-
ture jump exceeding 0.1   C.  DSW leaves the 
northwestern shelf without significant interleaving 
with ambient water.  Cold intrusions were not 
found in the region to the north of Cape Elizabeth.  
Along the east coast of Sakhalin Island this water 
begins to interleave with waters of the deep part of 
the sea.  The secondary minima of temperature 
were observed in the layer 150 – 600 m (26.75 – 27.10 s
q
) .  Active interleaving was observed near 
Te r peniya Cape and in the region of Terpeniya 
Bay between isopycnals 26.8 – 27.0 s
q
.  The isop y-
cnal and diapycnal mixing of these waters with 
su r rounding water makes the intermediate layer in 
the Okhotsk Sea colder, l ess saline and higher in 
ox y gen co n tent. 
 
Intermediate water in the Kuril Basin is also cha r-
acterized by the high level of finestructure activity.  
Examination of vertical profiles (Fig. 8) shows 
that a cold, fresh and rich - in - oxygen intrusion (st a-
tion 44 ) originating from the Sakhalin slope and a 
warm, saline, high - in - oxygen intrusion (st a tion 
55), related with dense SCW, were both ce n tered 
at 26.95 s
q
.  These stations were located around 
the antic y clonic eddy A2.  
Conditions for development of convection in the 
Soya Current region 
A vertical potential vorticity minimum was found 
at intermediate depths everywhere in the Okhotsk 
Sea.  The pycnostad indicates that OSIW can be a 
convectively formed water mass.  Climatic distr i-
bution shows that in the Okhotsk Sea the surface 
winter density does not exceed 26.7 s
q
 (Talley, 
1991).  The  cold  subsurface  (dichothermal) layer  
 
 
 
 
 represents a “rest” of a winter mixed layer.  
Therefore, it is possible to use the density in the 
core of this layer as the rough est imation of eff i-
ciency of direct ventilation in the Okhotsk Sea in 
winter.  A subsurface temperature minimum was 
identified for all CTD profiles.  The core of the 
cold subsurface layer was centered in the depth

range between 60 and 200 m, ranging in potenti al 
density from 26.5 to 26.7 s
q
.  For only two st a-
tions in the southern part of the sea (Stns. 57 and 
59) was the core of the cold subsurface layer cha r-
acterized by high potential density (about 26.75 
s
q
).  This shows that if intermediate convection 
takes place in the Okhotsk Sea, the convective r e-
newal of OSIW occurs only in the local region. 
 
The inflow of saline water in the Okhotsk Sea 
(Soya Current) creates favourable conditions for 
the development of convection in the southern part 
of the sea.  Saline water enters the Okhotsk Sea 
from the Japan Sea through the Soya (Laperuz) 
Strait.  During the maximum development of the 
Soya Current, warm and high - salinity water occ u-
pies the narrow region along the northern coast of 
Hokkaido and the southern Kuril Isl ands (Tak i-
zawa, 1982).  Water with a density of the interm e-
diate layer can be generated due to cooling the 
surface SCW. 
 
For determination of regions with favourable 
background conditions of stratification for deve l-
opment of convection, a simple mixed laye r model 
was used.  Starting with the observed profiles of 
temperature and salinity, this model removes from 
the upper mixed layer a constant amount of heat 
with each step (0.01   C) and reevaluates the static 
stability between the mixed layer and the layer 
b elow it.  If the mixed layer becomes denser than 
the water below, the water is completely mixed 
and the upper layer dee p ens. 
 
The results of calculations illustrate that in the 
Okhotsk Sea, at a temperature close to the freezing 
point, thermal convection c an form a mixed layer 
with a thickness of 40 – 50 m.  A sharp halocline 
prevents a penetration of convection to large 
depths.  Only in the Soya Current region (Stns. 
160 and 161) and in the area of transformation of 
SCW (St. 162) were the conditions favourab le for 
convection development (Table 1).  Warm and 
highly saline SCW was observed in the surface 
layer (Fig. 9).  Influence of the SCW at St. 160 
appears down to a depth of about 300 m.  At the 
bottom of this layer weak salinity and temperature 
minima were observed.  At St. 162 high salinity 
water occupied only a thin surface layer. These 
features of the vertical thermohaline structure cr e-
ate favourable conditions for the development of 
convection.  In the SCW area the deeping of the 
mixed layer begins at r elatively high temperature 
(about 8   C for St. 160) and quickly penetrates to 
the lower boundary of the warm and salty layer.  
After further cooling, convective mixing pen e-
trates into the intermediate waters and the

thickness of a mixed layer continues to be i n-
creased. In the area of transformation of the SCW 
where the contribu tion of saline water in density 
stratification is small, convective mixing begins at 
relatively low temperature (about 0.5   C for St. 
162).  The thickness of the mixed layer in this area 
at equal temperature is less in comparison with the 
SCW area.  Calcula tions of mixed layer param e-
ters at temperatures close to climatology in N o-
vember and December (Veselova, 1975) have 
shown (Table 1) that, in the SCW area (St. 160) at 
T = 1.53   C, the layer thickness is 427 m ( s
q
 = 
26.79).  In the transformation area of the SCW (St. 
162) at T = 0.01   C, the thickness of the mixed 
layer equals 246 m ( s
q
 = 26.82).  Comparison b e-
tween profiles of temperature, salinity and di s-
solved oxygen taken near Iturup Island before and 
after the winters of 1994 – 1995 (Fig. 10) shows 
apparent variation in the vertical structure from the 
surface to 450 m. ( s
q
 = 26.86)  Thus in the Soya 
Current region, due to cooling of the saline surface 
layer and subsequent convection, the intermediate 
water can be vent i lated. 
Conclusions 
The main results are summarised as follows.  The 
OSIW, in the range of potential density 26.7 – 27.1 
s
q
, can be ventilated through the impact of brine -
enriched DSW and consequent boundary mixing 
with ambient water which takes place along the 
Sakhalin Island shelf and slope.  Co ld, fresh and 
high - oxygen water originates from East Sakhalin 
and the dense SCW ventilated intermediate layer

Oceanographic conditions over the Kashevarov Bank

The abnormal distribution of the oceanographic 
parameters over the Kashevarov Bank has a t-
tracted the attention of many researchers.  In warm 
seasons, the surface waters here keep lower te m-
perature and higher salinity, than those of the su r-
rounding e nvironment.  On the contrary, in the 
subsurface layer, the destruction of the northern 
Okhotsk “cold core” is observed.  All year round, 
the deep waters over the bank remain unusually 
homogeneous in temperature, salinity, concentr a-
tion of dissolved oxygen, and nutrients.  Even in 
the winter, thin ice areas ( polynyas) are often 
found in the vicinity of the Kashev a rov Bank.  
 
There exist several assumptions today about the 
mechanism that forms specific hydrological and 
hydrochemical characteristics of this ar ea.  
Moroshkin (1966), and Kitani and Shimazaki 
(1971) noted the abnormal conditions of the water 
parameters in this region.  Akiba et al. (1959) and 
Kitani (1973) mentioned vertical water mixing as 
the reason, but did not specify its specific force.  
Cher nyavsky (1970), Veselova (1972), Kovshov 
and Sinyurin (1982), (Markina and Chernyavsky 
(1984), and Zhigalov and Matveev (1992), e x-
plained the situation by cyclonic water circulation 
alone, in conjunction with up - welling. Alfultis and 
Martin (1987), specula ted on a dominating role of 
up - welling over the bank.  Some authors, Zhabin 
and Zuenko (1993), and Kuzmina and Sklyarov 
(1984), considered tidal mixing and up - welling to 
be the co n tributing mechanism. 
 
A theoretical model has been worked out by Ka r-
pushin e t al. (1996), assuming that the abnormal 
distribution may be formed by the influence of the 
anti - cyclonic eddy (a Taylor – Hogg column), with 
a very small radius and a large cyclonic eddy. 
Such a circulation may cause intensive up - welling.  
Rogachev and Koso lapkin (1995) considered that 
homogeneous structures are formed as a result of 
summary influence of tidal and non - periodic cu r-
rents.  These authors confirm that mixing together 
the surface, dichothermal and mesothermal water 
masses is accompanied by an inc rease of water 
density and by the decline in sea level, as well as 
by causing the cyclonic circul a tion. 
 
All the explanations listed above are hypothetical, 
as it is difficult to differentiate one forcing co m-
ponent from another due to lack of oceanographic 
data to confirm the assumptions.  The largest pro b-
lem, apparently, is the absence of direct cu r rent 
measurement records, whic
