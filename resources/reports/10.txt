PREFACE
The experience of the 1982 El Niño was an event that caught the scientific community off guard,
leaving many oceanographers feeling somewhat chagrined.  At that time there were no large ocean
current programs operating in the Pacific coastal regions adjacent to the North and South American
continents.  In both Canada and the United States, some major projects designed to survey currents
over several years ended just before the 1982/83 El Niño started!
The experience of 1982/83 was not to recur this time.  As the El Niño built in 1997, several emergency
proposals were developed to monitor its evolution and impact.  The result was that the 1997/98 El Niño
is probably the best observed climate event in history.
However, climatologists and oceanographers around the world were still taken aback by the development
of the 1997/98 El Niño event during the spring of 1997, because the unusual timing and dramatic rise
in intensity very much earlier than normal was so extraordinary.  The media quickly tagged this as “the
mother of all El Niños”.  Such an amusing description aside, this was, by any standards, a very large
event, having a world-wide impact.
This one-day symposium reviewed the effects of the 1997/98 El Niño on the physical, chemical and
biological state of the northern North Pacific Ocean.  The object was to establish a list of impacts that
the climate anomaly had on the ocean, extending all of the way from the physics through the ecological
system, to plankton biology and onwards to the fisheries.  The symposium organizers wanted to provide
a forum for discussion from all regions of interest to the PICES family of nations on the impacts of the
El Niño.  The symposium took place in October 1998, when the El Niño was barely over.  Of
necessity, the descriptions are, therefore, preliminary in nature.  The unwritten hope was that
substantial areas of overlap would be discovered as scientists presented their favourite observations.
This would prompt others to revisit their observations, and encourage co-operation among investigators
from different regions.
As the presentations occurred, it quickly became apparent that stories being related from California,
Oregon, British Columbia, Alaska, the Bering Sea and so on, had an enormous overlap.  All regions
were reporting temperature changes, alterations in the stratification, and reduced nutrients and
plankton.  To that degree the symposium was successful — a consistent story had been developed.
We present that symposium material here.  Contributors from both oral and poster sessions were invited
to generate extended abstracts for this volume of proceedings.  Most of them accepted this offer
enthusiastically.  Four talks scheduled for either oral or poster sessions were not, in fact, presented at
the symposium.  For those, at the end of the volume, we simply publish the abstracts as they were
submitted.  The entire package will be available electronically via the PICES web page at
http://pices.ios.bc.ca and as a limited number of printed copies.  This is the first report in the PICES
Scientific Report Series with colour figures!
The results are preliminary, but we believe this volume represents a useful first look at the impacts of
the 1997/98 El Niño on the North Pacific Ocean.  The next step is taking place.  PICES, in cooperation
with the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), the International Pacific Halibut
Commission (IPHC), the Interim Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-Like Species in the North
Pacific Ocean (ISC), the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) and the Scientific
Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR), is organizing a four-day Beyond El Niño Conference to
vi
discuss evidence, consequences, mechanisms and implications of such events.  This conference will be
held March 23–26, 2000 in La Jolla, California.

The largest warm phase of the ENSO cycle o c -
curred in 1997–1998.  It was anticipated by some
modelling efforts and tracked by the TOGA-TAO
Array and TOPEX/Poseidon.
A post analysis of the low frequency surface
winds and sea surface temperature anomalies has
been done using the National Centers for Enviro n -
mental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis and Florida
State University tropical winds and the NOAA so-
called Reynolds sea surface temperature (SST)
anomalies.  An animation of the low-passed data
shows the evolution of the surface winds and SST
anomalies for 40 years.  Briefly, one can realize that
the Aleutian Low tends to be strong during the
warm phase and vice versa .  There is an obvious
connection between the Gulf of Alaska and the
equatorial P a cific.
The big event of 1997–98 was quite different than
previous events including the previous monster
warm phase event in 1982–87.  In 1997 anom a -
lously warm water appeared along the west coast of
North America months before it could be forced by
Kelvin wave advection from the south.
In the talk we emphasize some of the myths about
El Niño.  In particular the “Biggest Lie about El
Niño” is that the warm water in the western Pacific
gets advected to Equador.  This is not true.  Instead
the intraseasonal Kelvin waves lower the therm o -
cline by about 100–150m.  This destoys the local
heat balance and warming ensues by not mixing up
the deeper cold water.

Abstract
In the summer of 1997, positive sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) of greater than 2   C extended
across the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and into the eastern Bering Sea (EBS). The SSTA in the EBS are at
least in part due to atmospheric causes. Anomalously high 700-mb geopotential heights occurred over the
region during April through August. This resulted in enhanced warming of the GOA and EBS due to i n -
creased insolation. The pattern of positive 700 mb height anomalies for April through August 1997 is
similar to its counterpart formed by compositing the April through August anomalies that occurred during
previous El Niños. The warming in the Bering Sea and North Pacific during summer 1997 appears to be
due to the confluence of three factors: a decadal trend toward higher 700-mb heights, the El Niño, and a
particularly strong blocking ridge weather pattern in May. As fall 1997 progressed, the SSTA in the EBS
and non-coastal GOA dissipated due to increased storm activity, a winter signature of El Niño. More
complete documentation is found at http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/~miletta/npac1997 .html . Introduction
The intent of this abstract is to investigate
whether the observed anomalies in the Eastern Be r -
ing Sea (EBS) occurred over a larger region and to
investigate the relationship of the sea surface te m -
perature anomalies (SSTA) to concurrent meteor o -
logical anomalies. The EBS is remote from tropical
influences by direct oceanographic connection;
however, indirect connections exist through the a t -
mosphere. Recent studies suggest that there can be a
midlatitude response to tropical SSTA in all seasons
( Livezey et al., 1997; Trenberth et al . , 1998). B e -
cause the midlatitude background circulation differs
between winter and summer, the nature of the mi d -
latitude response to the El Niño–Southern Oscill a -
tion (ENSO) also varies seasonally. The influence
of ENSO at midlatitudes is believed to be related to
an equatorward extension of the midlatitude Pacific
jet stream and changes in mean flow/eddy feedback
(Hi g gins and Mo, 1997; Straus and Shukla, 1997).
Anomaly Fields in 1997
Sea surface temperature
Monthly SSTA fields in the North Pacific for
March through August 1997 are shown in Figure 1.
The fields are taken from the National Centers for
Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Reynolds anal y -
ses, which are based on a blending of satellite o b -
servations and in situ data (Reynolds and Smith,
1995). Positive (negative) anomalies equal to or
greater than 1   C are drawn in shades of red (blue),
with a contour interval of 1   C. The onset and inte n -
sification of the warm equatorial SSTA associated
with El Niño are recognizable, with a 1   C positive
anomaly near 180   in April and a large warm signal
from May onward. In the EBS in March, the cold
SSTA are –2   C. In April and May, the cold SSTA
gradually give way to the warm anomalies exten d -
ing westward from the GOA. May also shows the
strongest warm SSTA off the west coast of North
America at subtropical latitudes. By June, strong
warm SSTA stretch from the equator along the west
coast, across the GOA, and into the Bering Sea. The
extreme warm SSTA persist through August. The
warm SSTA in the EBS in July and August are
greater than 2   C. Local buoy observations (mooring
site 2) showed SST anomalies greater than 2   C
( Stabeno, personal communication). Based on the
Reynolds analyses, the EBS showed remarkable
SST warming of more than 12   C in a 5-month p e -
riod, compared to a more typical value of 8   C. By
November (not shown) the warm SSTA in the Be r -
ing Sea and non-coastal North Pacific had diss i -
pated.
Figure 1.  Monthly SST anomalies (SSTA) for the North Pacific for 1997. Positive (negative) anomalies
equal to or greater than 1   C are drawn in shades of red (blue) with a contour interval of 1   C. Data are from
NCEP analysis (Reynolds and Smith, 1995) and are a blend of satellite and in situ observations. Note the
increase of the equatorial SST anomaly after April. Subarctic SSTA increase after May, first in the Gulf of
Alaska and then in the Bering Sea.
700-mb geopotential height
The 700-mb geopotential height anomalies for
April–August are shown in Figure 2a. The 5-month
mean anomaly pattern shows positive heights over
the western Alaska and the EBS and negative
heights across the Pacific centered at about 45   N.
Time series of the 700-mb height (Figure 2b) at
Mooring 2 site (cross location in Figure 2a) also
shows the strong tendency for higher geopotential
heights in the EBS; particularly prominent positive
anomalies occurred in late May, late June, and mid-
late August.
Solar radi a tion
The net short wave anomalies from the NCEP r e -
analyses at the surface for April–August 1997 are
shown in Figure 3. In the 5-month mean, an extra 5–
10 W m
–2 was available to warm the ocean in the
central and eastern Bering Sea with the greatest
anomalous heating over Bristol Bay. The time series
in Figure 3b shows that the positive flux anomalies
at the Mooring 2 site were about 30 W m
–2 from
mid-May through mid-July. Assuming a typical
mixed layer depth of 20 m, this amount of anom a -
lous heat would increase the SST by 2   C.
Link to the Tropical Pacific?
Historical composites
In this section we examine covariability between
equatorial SSTA and midlatitude atmospheric ci r -
culation in all spring/summer months with a strong
El Niño signal. This is reasonable because the mi d -
latitude atmospheric circulation responds relatively
quickly, on time scales of a few weeks or less, to
tropical Pacific anomalies. As a measure of equat o -
rial SSTA we use the NINO3 index greater than 1.3
for SSTA between 5   N–5   S and 150   –90   W, avai l -
able from NCEP. The range of years considered is
1958–1996, limited by the NCEP reanalyses data
set.
The atmospheric circulation for the North Pacific
during the months of May and August 1997 best
resembled that which occurred for previous El N i -
ños. The overall similarity on a seasonal basis is
shown in Figure 4 which compares the April–
August mean 700-mb height field for 1997 and El
Niño composites. The 700-mb height anomaly
pattern is an amplified version of the ENSO
composite. The influence of the ENSO on northern
hemisphere a t mospheric conditions is most apparent

potential height.

on a seasonal time scale. As suggested by Figure 4,
the El Niño of 1997 during April and May had an
effect on the North Pacific, yet the tropical SSTA
were only ~1   C. These modest anomalies must be
considered in light of the seasonal cycle of the
tropical Pacific. Since central and eastern tropical
Pacific SSTs are warmest during the boreal spring,
relatively minor warming can cause the SST to e x -
ceed the 27   C threshold for deep cumulus conve c -
tion.  It is these anomalies in deep convection and
the associated upper- tropospheric zonal wind
anomalies that have repercussions on the global a t -
mospheric ci r culation.
Summary
The warm SSTA in the EBS and GOA during the
spring and summer of 1997 were partly related to
concurrent large-scale atmospheric anomalies. The
principal processes involved in producing the warm
SSTA were enhanced warm-air advection and ins o -
lation as revealed by the anomalous distributions of
low-level temperature, geopotential height, relative
humidity, and cloud cover.
The atmospheric circulation anomalies for the
EBS and GOA during spring and summer of 1997
appear to represent a particularly strong manifest a -
tion of the effect of ENSO. Support for a connection
to the tropical Pacific during this time of year is
provided by the GCM results of Livezey et al . (1997). A particularly prominent role for the tropical
Pacific should be expected because local ENSO
forcing, i.e., tropical Pacific SST, Outward Lon g -
wave Radiation (OLR), and 200-mb zonal wind
anomalies during the spring and summer of 1997, were exceptionally large by historical sta n dards.
The warming in the Bering Sea and North Pacific
during summer 1997 appears to be due to the co n -
fluence of three factors: a decadal trend toward
higher 700-mb geopotential heights as noted in the
time series of the spring teleconnection or NP pa t -
tern (Figure 5), the atmospheric ENSO connection
(Figure 4), and a particularly strong blocking ridge
weather pattern in May. Thus natural within-year
variability coincided with interannual and decadal
variability to produce extremely anomalous sea
temperature conditions in the Bering Sea.

Abstract
The oscillations of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) scale (3–7 years) in oceanographic
and meteorological characteristics in the Northwest Pacific are studied. Monthly mean sea su r -
face temperature (SST) for the period of 1947–1978 was subjected to the Complex Empirical O r -
thogonal Functions (CEOF) analysis in time domain to study moving features in SST anomaly pa t -
terns in the North Pacific. Both unlagged and lagged correlations were found between air
temperature at the Northwest Pacific Margin coastal meteorological stations for the 20th century or
ice extent in the Sea of Okhotsk for the second part of the 20th century with SOI. Meteorological
situations were also considered over the North Pacific based on the classification developed by
Polyakova (1992, 1997). Six principal types of synoptic situations represented by characteristic sea
level pressure (SLP) fields are associated mainly with different locations of cyclone tracks and of
high/low pressure over the North Pacific. It was shown that the ENSO signal with a lag of about
half a year may be associated with the Northwest Pacific Ocean memory in a seasonal cycle. The
ENSO signal with a lag of about one year is probably conditioned by both oceanic SST anomalies
propagating from the tropic–equatorial Pacific to the extratropic areas and by theatmosphere circ u -
lation response to these anomalies.
1. Introduction
The El-Niño - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an
oscillation of a 3–7 year period in the atmosphere–
ocean system ( Bjerknes , 1969) observed mainly in
the equatorial/tropical Pacific as an alternation of El
Niño/La Niña events in the ocean ( Wyrtki , 1975)
and Southern Oscillation in the atmosphere studied
by numerous researchers started from the pioneer
work of Walker (1924).
El Niño, or warm phase of ENSO, is an ocean o -
graphic phenomenon of warm surface water pool
formation offshore of the coasts of Ecuador and
Peru, accompanied by the follo w ing events:
• Subtropic High Pressure weakens in the
Southeast Pacific while sea level pressure
(SLP) rises over Australia–Indonesian area
that corresponds to negative phase of Southern
Oscillation (negative values of  Southern O s -
cillation Index – SOI);
• typical Walker circulation and sout h -
ern/northern hemisphere trade winds weaken;
• atmospheric convection area of Walker circ u -
lation shifts eastward from the western (Au s -
tralian–Indonesian area) to the central trop i -
cal/equatorial Pacific and South America
maritime area;
• westerly winds originate over the area of the
western and central equatorial Pacific;
• a warm sea surface temperature (SST) ano m -
aly moves east to the central eastern equatorial
Pacific while a cold anomaly forms in the
western area;
• heating decreases in the western tropical P a -
cific and South Asian winter monsoon wea k -
ens;
• meridional winds and Hadley circulation
weaken in the western area and shift eas t ward;
• low winter and spring rainfall in the Australia–
Indonesian area with Australian summer mo n -
soon onset late and generally poor.
The modern state of the problem is described as
achievements of the TOGA Program (Learning to
Predict Climate Variations Associated with El Niño
and Southern Oscillation, Accomplishments and
Legacies of the TOGA Program, 1996) where most
of the important recent scientific results related to
ENSO, including the extratropic response to ENSO
and its relationship with the Asian–Australian mo n -
soon (Yang and Webster, 1990), are also outlined.
To explain the reason and physical mechanism of
ENSO, the basic idea of coupled atmosphere–ocean
instability in tropics was suggested in early 80s
(Philander et al., 1984). The unstable coupled a t -
mosphere–ocean mode was found using shallow
water atmosphere–ocean models (Philander et al.,
1984; Hirst, 1986).
At the same time, a lot of meteorological and
oceanographic data, observed in both the tropics and
extratropics during ENSO events were collected and
analyzed particularly on the basis of the TOGA
project. As suggested, irregularity of ENSO may be
caused by nonlinearity in the ocean–atmosphere
system and interactions between ENSO and anom a -
lies of the annual cycle in the tropics and extratro p -
ics. Substantial anomalies of ENSO cycles and
changes of El Niño and La Niña occurrences during
winters from 1950 to 1995 were shown by Zhang
and Wallace (1996) and many others. In particular,
La Niña occurrences in winter have dramatically
decreased since 1977. After a maximum interval
between El Niño events from 1974 to 1982, La Niña
events have become weaker and have taken place
mostly in summer while El Niño has dominated in
winter and has become more frequent since 1987.
According to Sekine and Yamada (1996) and S e -
kine (1998), the ENSO cycle has a feedback from
anomalies of winter snow coverage over the Asian
continent and summer monsoon winds. In this case,
the large-scale processes in the mid-latitude impact
on ENSO.
Therefore, the main goal of our study is to find
new evidence of ENSO accompanying events in the
mid-latitude Northwest Pacific on the basis of met e -
orological and oceanographic data analyses.
The present work contains:
• a brief background review of the tropic–extr a -
tropic relationship associated with ENSO;
• an interpretation of SST anomaly development
and movement in the North Pacific using the
Complex Empirical Orthogonal Functions
(CEOF) method;
• an estimation of the statistical relationship
between ENSO and anomalies of meteorolog i -
cal/ oceanographic characteristics in the
Northwest Pacific Margin;
• a discussion of typical synoptic situations,
their variations, and impact on the subarctic
West Pacific Margin.
In the following review earlier studies on the e x -
tratropic response to ENSO are discussed which are
related to, or promote better understanding of, our
findings.
2. Background on the tropic- extratropic rel a -
tionship associated with ENSO
The extratropic response to ENSO is mostly co n -
sidered as a global scale phenomenon in the coupled
ocean–atmosphere system. It is explained by the
ENSO impact on hemispheric patterns of geopote n -
tial height and upper ocean temperature anomalies
( Bjerknes, 1969; Horel and Wallace, 1981; Tre n -
berth and Paolino, 1981; Alexander, 1992a,b; Lau
and Nath, 1990; Palmer, 1993; Molteni et al., 1993).
The part of the variance associated with long-
term variability of different scales reaches its max i -
mal values in the subarctic zonal belt. Therefore, the
extratropic response to ENSO in the atmosphere
seems to be obscured and highly nonlinear ( Geisler
et al., 1985) due to its interaction with internally
generated oscillations. In turn, the internally gene r -
ated mid-latitude SST variations may overwhelm
the signal from anomalies of tropical heating ( Tre n -
berth, 1995).
Palmer (1993) and Molteni et al. (1993) argued
that, despite very large natural variability of the e x -
tratropical circulation, there exist certain preferred
regimes with rather persistent flow patterns pr e -
sumably associated with the land–sea distribution
and climatological planetary waves. The effect of
tropical SST forcing alters the frequency of occu r -
rence and stability of certain pre-existing regimes

The principal questions related to our study are as
follows: what kinds of large-scale circulation pro c -
esses in the North Pacific atmosphere influence the
extratropical regimes and, at the same time, are the
most closely related to the tropic–extratropic inte r -
action and to ENSO. Those are known to be the m e -
ridional Hadley circulation, westerly jet stream and
monsoon circulation. Effects of heating displac e -
ment in the tropics on the location and intensity of
Hadley circulation and westerly jet stream ( Lau and
Boyle, 1987; Yang and Webster, 1990; Hou , 1993;
Oort and Yienger , 1996), as well as on the monsoon
system anomalies (Tanaka, 1982; Schucla and Pa o -
lino , 1983; Wu and Hastenrath , 1986; Webster and
Yang, 1992; Webster et al., 1997) are actually co n -
sidered as important physical devices of the extr a -
tropic r e sponse to ENSO in the atmosphere.
Physical processes of synoptic scale which act u -
alize the ENSO-scale remote linkages in the atmo s -
phere are actually associated with propagation of
faster, barotropic (Simmons et al., 1983) and slower,
baroclinic ( Blackmon et al., 1977; Lau and Boyle
1987; Hou , 1993) waves as well as with changes of
extratropical storm tracks ( Branstator , 1995) and
tropical cyclone activity in the Western Pacific
(Chan, 1985; Chen and Weng , 1998).
As for oceanic teleconnections, the poleward
ENSO signal propagation in the North Pacific
Ocean was described by Johnson and O’Brien
(1990a,b). Based on circulation model and observ a -
tion data analysis they showed that temperature and
upper layer thickness anomalies propagate nort h -
ward along the eastern coast of North America due
to coastal Kelvin waves and reach the 50   N latitude
in about one year. Westward temperature anomaly
propagation to the central Pacific is due to bar o -
clinic Rossby waves excited by coastal Kelvin
waves.
Thus, one can suggest that, at least in the North
Pacific, both a northward fast ENSO signal in the
atmosphere and slow ENSO signal in the ocean e x -
ist. Propagation of both these signals is controlled
by synoptic-scale processes, atmospheric ones of
order of a week, and oceanic ones of order of a few
months, which, in turn, interact with larger-scale
processes. An oceanic signal propagating northward
along the eastern Pacific boundary and westward
offshore to the subtropical central Pacific more pr o -
nounced while an atmospheric signal is rather o b -
scured in the extratropic area.
It seems that the atmospheric ENSO signal may
be dominant in the Northwest Pacific Margin due to
its interaction with the Asian monsoon system in
southern (tropic- subtropic) and northern (subarctic)
areas. This suggestion is supported by previous
studies on data analyses in the area of the North
Asian monsoon and westerly jet stream.
In this study we examined the relationship at zero
or half-year (seasonal) lags between SOI, air te m -
perature in the Northwest Pacific Margin from the
southern Japanese Kushu Island and Korean Peni n -
sula (30   N) to the Chukchy Peninsula (70   N), and
ice extent in the Sea of Okhotsk. At the same time,
we analyzed ENSO (including 1997–98 El Niño–La
Nina events) accompanying meteorological situ a -
tions over the extratropic North Pacific and how
their occurrence is related to seasonal/monthly air
temperature and ice extent anomalies. To estimate
the oceanic response to ENSO in the Northwest P a -
cific Margin we also analyzed propagation of winter
SST anomalies using complex EOF method.
3. Data and Methods
To estimate the propagation of SST anomalies in
the North Pacific, the archive of monthly mean SST
was used. It consists of 384 time counts for 32 years
from 1947–1978 taken in 163 5   · 5   grid points for
the area of 20–55   N, 120   E–120   W. A time period
was chosen up to 1978 so that the recent shift in
climate regime occurred in 1976 which resulted in
changes of occurrence of El Niño–La Niña events is
not included in the consideration. It is a subject of
further analysis to estimate an impact of this change
upon anomaly patterns in the North P a cific.
To study moving features in the anomaly patterns,
the complex principal components analysis in time
domain was applied to signals composed of original
SST data. Theoretical development of the method
can be found in Brillinger (1975) and Horel (1984).
Conventional (unfiltered) anomalies were computed
by subtracting temperature mean values for every
month, thus removing the climatic seasonal cycle.
Asymmetric filtering ( Enting and Robbins, 1989)
was applied to obtain signals representing variabi l -
ity in different time scales (Section 4).
Time series of monthly mean air temperature at
meteorological stations in the Northwest Pacific
Margin for the 20th century, mainly up to 1990, and
10-day mean ice extent for the Okhotsk and Bering
Seas from 1960 to 1998 ( Plotnikov , 1997) were
chosen for estimation of seasonal links with ENSO
by correlation anal y sis (Section 5).
To consider atmosphere conditions over the North
Pacific associated with ENSO and their impact on
the Northwest Pacific Margin, time series
(days/month) of frequency of occurrence were an a -
lyzed for six synoptic situations as SLP fields over
the mid-latitude North Pacific from 1949 to 1998
based on the classification and calendar developed
by Polyakova (1992, 1997). Correlation analysis
was used to reveal their relationship with ENSO
based upon both lagged and unlagged correlation
est i mates (Section 6).
4. Interpretation of SST Anomaly Development and Movement in the North Pacific
The decomposition of ocean/atmosphere fields
into normal spatial and temporal components known
as an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis
is widely applied to reconstruct anomaly patterns in
space. Filtering, harmonic and spectral analyses are
performed to study variability in time. However,
standard EOF analysis is not able to separate mo v -
ing oscillations from standing ones or directly est i -
mate anomaly propagation. For this reason, an alte r -
native method of complex empirical orthogonal
function (CEOF) for detecting moving features is
currently employed when eigenvalues and eige n -
vectors are computed for cross spectrum matrix
(frequency domain method; Brillinger, 1975) or
complex covariance matrix (time domain method;
Horel, 1984). In the latter case, complex signals are
first composed of initial scalar fields when an
imaginary part is taken as the Gilbert transform of a
real part (original data). CEOFs and time series of
complex principal components (PCs) obtained are
characterized by amplitude and phase (hereafter r e -
ferred to as spatial/temporal amplitude and phase);
power spectra of PC time series are calculated to
estimate time-scales of var i ability.
Movement of monthly mean SST anomalies in
the mid-latitude central North Pacific area for the
period of 1947–1976 was earlier estimated by
Michaelsen (1982) applying CEOF analysis in fr e -
quency domain. He showed that SST anomalies
propagate in the northeastward direction in a dom i -
nant frequency band of about 0 .02 cpm (cycles per
month; inverse months). The corresponding period
of 4.2 years can be associated with the characteristic
ENSO p e riod.
Trousenkov (1991) applied CEOF techniques in
time domain for SST anomalies in the North Pacific
(20   –55   N, 120   E–120   W) based on the archive of
monthly mean SST described in Section 3. Figure 1
shows (a) spatial amplitude and (b) phase for the
first CEOF (20% of variance). A high amplitude
belt spreads in the tropical region and eastern and
central Pacific areas, with maximum amplitudes
located near the North American coast from 35   N to
45   N. According to the spatial phase, anomalies
associated with the first CEOF propagate along the
axis between the northeastward and southeastward
corners of the basin, tending to bypass the Nort h -
west Pacific area where spatial amplitude is min i -
mal.
The power spectrum of the first PC covers a wide
range of time scales from 5 months to 10 years but
has an absolute maximum ENSO time scale (3.5–
5.3 years). It also has weaker 1.5- and 1-year peaks
and intra-annual peaks with periods of 7–8 and 5–6
months (Figure 2a). Lagged correlation coefficients
were calculated between the first PC temporal a m -
plitude and SOI/Nino3 Index (Figure 3a). Correl a -
tion curves of the PC amplitude with SOI and Nino3
are symmetrical along the x -axis which is obviously
due to high negative correlation between the SOI
and El Niño Index, so it is enough to use either one
for further anal y sis.

anomalies with the low-pass pre-filtered El Niño Index in the extra-tropical North Pacific (1947–1978).
    Substantial asynchronic links with 1.5–1 year
(–18, –24 months in the x -axis, Figure 3a) SST
anomaly delay were obtained as well as weaker but
statistically significant links with 1 year (+12
months in the x -axis, Figure 3a) SOI/Niño3 Index
delay. Asynchronic links obtained are characteristic
for the entire North Pacific where the first CEOF
spatial amplitude is high with the exception of the
Northwest Pacific where the spatial amplitude is
low (Figure 1a). Periodicity of the correlation coe f -
ficient as a function of lag is about 5 years which
corresponds to the ENSO time scale. Positive
lagged correlation with SST anomalies behind
Niño3 corresponds to positive anomalies over the
extra-tropic North Pacific as a whole formed in 1.5–
2 years after the El Niño event. This is consistent
with general idea of oceanic ENSO teleconnection
(Johnson and O’Brien, 1990a,b, and many others).
Negative lagged correlation with Nino3 behind SST
anomalies points out that ENSO seems to have a
positive feedback with extra-tropic North Pacific
SST anomalies.
However, the first PC temporal phase (not shown)
implies that SST anomalies can propagate in either
direction along the northeast–southwest axis as
phase mostly decreases with time but increases in
some periods. (When the temporal phase gradually
increases/decreases, a wave propagates from
lower/higher to higher/lower values of spatial phase;
abrupt phase jumps are due to its being conventio n -
ally bounded in a range from - p to p.)  This can be
explained by the fact that analyzed time series co n -
sist of anomalies of varied time scales. So, pre-
filtered narrow-band data should be processed to
obtain patterns for SST anomalies of a certain time
scale.
On the contrary, the second CEOF of unfiltered
SST anomalies (12% of variance) shows the stan d -
ing wave with the amplitude localized in the western
Pacific with maximum amplitude in the area of 35   – 45   N (Figure 1c). The western subarctic area is in
anti-phase with the western subtropical area, the
dividing line is stretched along 32–33   N, in the area
of the Kuroshio Extension. The contour line of zero
phase is also shown in the Figure 1c as a thick solid
line and dashed lines represent phases of - p, - p/2,
p/2, p. (Abrupt rise and fall of phase on both sides
of the zero contour means that the second CEOF is a
standing oscill a tion.)
To separate time scales further analysis was pe r -
formed based upon filtered time series both of SST
and their anom a lies.
To estimate contribution of a seasonal signal into
propagation of temperature waves in the North P a -
cific seasonal SST time series were obtained by a p -
plying a band-pass filter with a band of 0.05–0.1
cpm (corresponding periods of 9–21 months) to the
original SST fields. The CEOF method in time d o -
main was applied to the filtered SST. The general
(first) seasonal CEOF (93% of variance) is a stan d -
ing wave in the subtropical Pacific where the wes t -
ern area is in phase with the eastern one and they
both are in the anti-phase with the central area. No
moving features were found for the seasonal signal,
so, this pattern may be explained by sea–land co n -
trasts and atmosphere–ocean interaction in a annual
c y cle.
To remove short-time (seasonal and bi-annual)
signals from the monthly SST time series a low-pass
filter with periods longer than 21 months was a p -
plied to the original monthly SST. In this case, with
the absence of intra-annual and bi-annual variations
in the signal, the general (first)
 
mode (97% of var i -
ance) shows no oscillate features and it does not
have significant local maxima in its spectrum. The
second CEOF (1% of variance) has high amplitudes,
mainly in the western subarctic Pacific (the area to
the north of 40   N adjacent to Hokkaido and Kuril
Islands) as shown in Figure 4a. The spatial phase
pattern (Figure 4b) shows that this mode is a supe r -
position of a progressive and standing waves. As for

the standing oscillation, its pattern is similar to the
second mode for conventional SST anomalies but
with a sharper outlined area of maximum ampl i -
tudes. However, the second PC temporal spectrum
has high values in a range of 4.8–10 years with
max i mum at 7.2 years (Figure 2b).
Thus, analysis for pre-filtered SST time series
shows that there are no progressive waves left in
general CEOFs for either seasonal or interannual
signals. It is concluded that propagating features
should be associated with SST anomalies rather than
SSTs themselves. Lack of progressive oscillations in
the two general modes of low-pass filtered SST
component covering 98% of total variance is ev i -
dence that moving disturbances are associated with
SST anomalies the in seasonal cycle. This gave
grounds to believe that winter anomalies would be
more info r mative.
    The same low-pass filtering and CEOF proc e -
dures were applied to SST monthly anomalies taken
for winters only. Time series consist of SST anom a -
lies taken for December, January and February of
every year (96 time counts). A maximum of spatial
amplitude for the first CEOF (29% of variance) co r -
responds to the known Kelvin wave propagating
along the eastern Pacific coast. Another spatial a m -
plitude maximum corresponds to the Rossby wave
propagating in the westward direction from the eas t -
ern coast to the central midlatitude Pacific area
(Figure 5a) confirmed by the spatial (Figure 5b) and
temporal (not shown) phases. Spatial phase grad i -
ents suggest that SST anomalies propagate wes t -
ward from the eastern Pacific margin up to 155–
160   W in the belt of 30–40   N (Figure 5b), in line
with the Johnson - O’Brien model (Johnson and
O’Brien, 1990a, b).
Anomaly wave turns southwestward from the
spatial amplitude maximum area (30–40   N, 170   E–
160   W). Significant spatial phase gradients and,
therefore, southwestward wave propagation are
characteristic of the entire western subtropic Pacific.
It corresponds to the results of ocean surface level
data analysis ( ERS 1 satellite three-day repeat a l -
timeter data) on southwestward propagation of
waves in the area of 30–40   N, 145–160   E off the
Japanese coast (Minster and Gennero 1995).
The first PC temporal amplitude for low-pass pre-
filtered winter SST anomalies seems to be corr e -
lated to the monthly low-pass pre-filtered El-Niño
Index time series taken for winters only. Its lagged
correlation (Figure 3b) is positive and statistically
significant within –1 year (PC amplitude delayed)
and +2 year (PC amplitude leading) lag range. It
reaches its maximum of 0.61 at a zero lag, i.e. for
unlagged correlation. Unlike lagged links of the first
PC for unfiltered SST anomalies (Figure 3a), high
synchronic correlation of the first PC for low-pass
filtered winter SST anomalies with the El Niño I n -
dex points out to the possible impact of ENSO-
accompanying processes in the winter extratropic
atmosphere. The spectrum of the first PC (Figure
6a) has its absolute maximum shifted to decadal
time-scales (“red shift”) compared to the spectrum
for unfiltered SST anomalies (Figure 2a).
Unlike the first CEOF, the second mode for pre-
filtered winter SST anomalies (16% of variance)
shows maximum amplitudes in the western Pacific
in the belt of 30   –55   N (Figure 5c). Spatial (Figure
5d) and temporal (not shown) phases reveal the si g -

175   E–175   W) in the opposite directions: sout h -
westward in the western subtropic area and nort h -
eastward in the eastern subarctic area. This is sim i -
lar to the finding of Mizuno and White (1983) based
on analysis of 300-m temperature data (from 1976–
1980, at 30   –40   N, 130   –180   E) that in the Kur o -
shio Extension area temperature waves propagate
westward in the area to the west of the Shatsky Rise
(155   E) and eastward to the east of there.
The second PC temporal amplitude also shows a
correlation with the pre-filtered winter El Niño I n -
dex although lower in value compared to the first
mode (Figure 3b). However, in this case, correlation
is statistically significant for zero lag and delays up
to 1 year only.  The spectrum of the second PC
(Figure 6b) has its absolute maximum in a wider
range including decadal and ENSO scales, co m -
pared to the spectrum for unfiltered SST anomalies
(Figure 2a). Thus, removing short-scale variations
from SST anomalies reveals decadal together with
ENSO variations both in the first and second modes.
    Recently, a substantial interest has arisen to
studies on decadal variation which are considered
generated in midlatitudes. Analyzing SST anomalies
along the coast of the Sea of Japan for the period
from 1930/40 to 1984, Watanabe et al. (1986)
showed that while 6-year variations dominate in an
area adjacent to the Korean Strait, the decadal scale
prevails in the northwestern area. Nakamura et al.
(1997) applied EOF (not complex) analysis to wi n -
ter mean SST anomalies for the North Pacific to
analyze decadal variations removing ENSO and
lower-scale signals. Spatial patterns obtained by
Nakamura et al. for the first and second EOFs are
similar to our second and first CEOF spatial ampl i -
tudes obtained for the pre-filtered winter SST
anomalies, correspondingly (Figure 5c,a); namely,
the mentioned pairs show common areas of high
amplitude. However, compared to Nakamura et al.’s
first EOF, in our case, an area of high amplitude for
the second CEOF is shifted to the west to the trans i -
tion area between Oyashio–Kuroshio Current Sy s -
tems where the most intensive ocean–atmosphere
interaction takes place in winter. The presence of
both decadal and ENSO variations in SST as well as
synchronic correlation of PCs with SOI gives ev i -
dence of feedback between decadal and ENSO time-
scale dynamic processes in the ocean–atmosphere
system in this area which is consistent with findings
of S e kine and Yamada (1996) and Sekine (1998).
5. Seasonal Links between ENSO and Air
Temperature in the Northwest Pacific
Ma r gin
Characteristic time scales of infra-annual air te m -
perature variations in the Northwest Pacific Margin
were obtained from power spectra for stations l o -
cated in the area from the Korean to Chukchy  Pe n -
insulas. Spectra were estimated based on monthly
mean time series for the 20th century, often more
then 100 years, taken separately for every month.
We chose the three following intervals of interest in
the time-scale: biennial (2–3 years), quasi-ENSO
(3–7 years), and quasi-decadal (7–13 years) inte r -
vals.
As a typical example, periods obtained for st a -
tions located around the Japan Sea are shown in the
Table 1. It includes all spectral maximums of 95%-
significance level and shows that every chosen time
interval has, as a rule, the only maximum. Well
known biennial variations are present at all stations
for almost all months. ENSO and decadal scale
variations are also present at almost all stations for

more pronounced at the continental stations, on the
one hand, and at the subarctic stations, on the other
hand. In particular, one can see from the Table 1
that along the Japanese Islands coast decadal vari a -
tions are present in winter at the Akita and Supporo
stations located to the north of 39   N. As for the
Nikolaevsk station located to the north of Tatar
Strait at the Okhotsk Sea coast, decadal variations
are present for 7 months of a year. This is typical for
most stations around the Sea of Okhotsk, the i n -
cluding Kamchatka Peni n sula coast.

Spectra for time series (about 100 years) of winter
3- and 5-month (December–February and Nove m -
ber–March) mean air temperature for meteorolog i -
cal stations located around the Japan Sea and SOI
are shown in Figure 7. Air temperature spectra e x -
hibit only two maximums, one corresponding to
biennial variations and the other maximum shifted
to the decadal scale (7–9 years). Figure 7 also shows that spectral density significantly increases from the
southeast to the northwest. Spectra estimated for the
Okhotsk Sea and Pacific coasts of the Kamchatka
Peninsula show similar patterns. This is consistent
with the spectrum for the second PC of low-pass
filtered winter SST anomalies which has a wide
maximum in a range of decadal and ENSO scales
(Figure 6b) while the area of maximum spatial a m -
plitudes of this CEOF covers the western subarctic
Pacific. As for air temperature time series averaged
for summer, spring or fall for stations located
around the southern Japan Sea, the dominating
maximum corresponds, as a rule, to the typical
ENSO time-scale.
Thus, the presence of well pronounced ENSO and
decadal scale variations in the subarctic area corr e -
sponds to findings based on the analysis of North
Pacific winter SST (Nakamura et al., 1997, results
of the present study) as well as of Oyashio Intrusion
and snow coverage over the eastern Asia ( Sekine
and Yamada, 1996). Therefore, the relationship
between seasonal air temperature anomalies with
ENSO should be an a lyzed.
To reveal seasonal links between SOI and air
temperature in the Northwest Pacific correlation
analysis was applied. Lagged and unlagged correl a -
tion coefficients were calculated between time series
of SOI and air temperature averaged for 5 (Nove m -
ber–March or May–September) and 3 months (D e -
cember–February or June–August) at the meteor o -
logical stations in the Northwest Pacific Margin.
Lagged correlation was estimated between air te m -
perature time series taken for winter and SOI taken
for the previous (time lag of -6 months) or next
summer (time lag of 6 months). Examples of corr e -
lation coefficients calculated for the period of 1940–
1990 are shown in Table 2.
Statistically significant unlagged positive correl a -
tion between winter mean air temperature and SOI
was found for stations located at the Sakhalin, Sib e -
rian and Kamchatka coasts of the Okhotsk Sea. It
means that air temperature tends to have a positive
anomaly during winter La Niña events and a neg a -
tive anomaly during winter El Niño events. An e x -
ample for air temperature at the Ust-Hairuzovo m e -
teorological station located at the Kamchatka coast
of the Okhotsk Sea superimposed with North Pacific
Index (NPI) and SOI is shown in Figure 8. The co r -
relation coefficient with SOI is statistically signif i -
cant with a 95%-confidence level and equal to 0.55.
Moreover, total ice coverage in the Okhotsk Sea
also shows a linear relationship with SOI (Figure 9).
A 10-day mean time series (1957–1989) was calc u -
lated by averaging the ice extent during periods of
greater ice cover for every year (21–28 of
February, 1–10, 11–20 and 21–30 of March, and 1–
10 of April). Its unlagged correlation coefficient
with SOI is equal to –0.45 with a 95%-confidence
level. Its lagged correlation coefficient with SOI for
a previous summer (SOI taken 6 months behind) is
equal to –0.46 with a 95%-confidence level. Thus,
ice coverage increases in years of winter El Niño
events or in winters after summer El Niño events
and decreases in years of winter La Niña events or
in winters after summer La Niña events (Figure 9).
(SOI has the highest negative values during El Niño
events and highest positive values during La Niña
events.)
At the same time, air temperature at the met e -
orological stations situated at the northeast Ho k -
kaido coast (Nemuro and Abashiry) and at the south
Kuril Islands, do not have a statistically significant
unlagged correlation with the internal O k -
hotsk/Japan Sea coastal stations or SOI.
There is no lagged correlation between winter air
temperature at the Okhotsk Sea coastal stations and
SOI of a next summer (+6 months) while the lagged
correlation between the mentioned time series and
SOI of a previous summer (–6 months) is statist i -
cally significant but still smaller compared with the
unlagged ones (Table 2). This is in accordance with
the presence of synchronic and delayed correlation
between the El Niño Index and the second temporal
PC for the pre-filtered winter SST anomalies (Fi g -
ure 3b) while the corresponding spatial CEOF has
high amplitudes in the western subarctic Pacific
(Figure 5c).
The seasonal mean air temperature time series in
the meteorological stations located at the oceanic
coast of Kamchatka and adjacent Komandorsky I s -
lands also show statistically significant unlagged
correlation with SOI for winter. However, no stati s -
tically significant unlagged correlation was found
for air temperature and SOI at the Chukchy coast of
the Bering Sea, or at the Chukchy coast of the
Chukchy Sea.
As for the unlagged correlation between winter
(3- or 5-month mean) air temperature at the Japan
Sea coastal stations and SOI, the statistically si g -
nificant coefficients were obtained mainly for the
stations situated along the subarctic Northwest J a -
pan Sea coast (Vladivostok, Nakhodka, Terney,
Cape Zolotoi, Aleksandrovsk). On the co n trary, 5-
month summer (May–September) mean air te m -
perature time series show a high unlagged correl a -
tion with SOI at the southern stations located along
the southeastern coast of the Japan Sea (Akita,

Adgihara, Fukuoka). The significant correlation
between 3-month summer (June–August) air te m -
perature and SOI is revealed only for the most
southern stations, for exa m ple Fukuoka.
So, a significant local maximum of the ENSO
time scale in the spectrum of monthly mean air te m -
perature was found for most meteorological stations
in the Northwest Pacific Margin, but air temperature
and SOI are related in a different way in the sout h -
ern (South Japan Sea coast and Korean Peninsula),
mid (Okhotsk Sea coast and Kamchatka Peninsula)
and northern (Bering Sea coast and Chukchy Peni n -
sula) areas. This difference is associated with
asymmetry of the seasonal temperature anomalies in
an annual cycle. Air temperature over the South J a -
pan Sea is more under influence of ENSO-
accompanying dynamic processes in the extratrop i -
cal summer atmosphere, whereas air temperature
over the North Japan Sea, Okhotsk Sea and Ka m -
chatka Peninsula is mostly subjected to the impact
of the ENSO accompanying processes in the winter
a t mosphere.
NPI measuring intensity of the Aleutian Low also
has a statistically significant unlagged correlation
with SOI for winter (Figure 8) but not for summer.
Correlation coefficients for 5- and 3-month winter
mean time series are equal to 0.58 and 0.41, respe c -
tively. Besides, lagged correlation coefficients b e -
tween winter NPI and SOI taken for a previous
summer (–6 months lag) are statistically significant
as well and equal to 0.49 and 0.45, for 3- and 5-
month averaging, respectively. At the same time, the
NPI spectrum has a well known decadal spectral
maximum, which is also present in the time series of
air temperature (Table 1) over the Western Subar c -
tic Pacific Margin. Ice extent in the Sea of Okhotsk
shows a decadal maximum in the spectrum as well
( Plotnikov, 1997).
According to air temperature and SST analyses
one can suggest that ENSO and decadal scale vari a -
tions in the North Pacific are connected via both
annual–biennial oscillations of the Asian Monsoon
and ocean–atmosphere interaction in the western
mid-latitude ( subarctic/ subtropic) and central su b -
tropic Pacific.
6. Typical Synoptic Situations,
their Variations, and Impact on
the Subarctic Northwest Pacific Ma r gin
Polyakova (1992, 1997) developed the heuristic
classification based on daily sea surface pressure
(SLP) fields and suggested six principal types of
atmosphere synoptic circulation over the North P a -
cific (Figures 10–15). The choice of original obse r -
vations rather than averaged, for example monthly
data, gave classes which keep information on sy n -
optic processes.

Positions of cyclone tracks as well as of the
Aleutian Low Pressure and Subtropic High Pressure
Centers were chosen as classifying attributes for
atmospheric circulation patterns. Characteristic sy n -
optic situations (classes) presented as six SLP fields
correspond to known atmospheric circulation pa t -
terns over the North Pacific area obtained earlier by
(Wallace and Gutzler, 1981) and over the Northern
Hemisphere ( Barnston and Livezey, 1987) using
EOF analysis of averaged SLP fields. In particular,
Polyakova’s expert situations reflect the Pacific–
North American (PNA), East–West (EW), Zonal D i -
pole (ZD) patterns. The latter is similar to the P a -
cific Transition (PT) pattern in the hemispheric cla s -
sification ( Barnston and Livezey, 1987).
It was shown earlier that due to ENSO events
over the Northern Hemisphere “...changes in the
extratropical circulation immediately begin to
change the jet stream and the associated storm
tracks, so that the heat and vorticity fluxes caused
by the transient eddies in the extratropics are also
altered.” ( Branstator, 1995 ; citation from Learning
to Predict Climate Variations Associated with El
Nino and the Southern Oscillation , 1996). This
gives grounds to believe that Polyakova’s calendar
of six atmosphere circulation pattern occurrences
may be closely connected with ENSO accompan y -
ing events in the mid-latitude Northwest Pacific.
Three situations show a more or less pronounced
meridional (Figures 10, 12, 14) and three situations
show quasi-zonal (Figures 11, 13, 15) circulation
patterns over the North Pacific. The former ones are
associated with sea–land temperature contrasts,
while the latter ones may be considered as related to
south–north temperature contrasts. Higher fr e -
quency of occurrence of zonal or meridional types
may accompany weakening or strengthening of both

the Asian winter and summer monsoons in the
Northwest Pacific Margin, respectively. It is esp e -
cially true for the subarctic Northwest Pacific area
where the highest variance of both air temperature
and SST anomalies of a seasonal cycle was found.
A characteristic example for low-frequency vari a -
tions in the subarctic Northwest Pacific is also the
South Oyashio Intrusion ( Hanawa, 1995; Sekine,
1996).
Thus, the classification used in the present study
can be a basis for the estimation of interannual
variations in both the Asian Monsoon and circul a -
tion patterns in the North Pacific atmosphere via
anomalies of synoptic situation frequency of occu r -
rence and cyclone track changes in transitions from
one situation to another. Time series were composed
of monthly frequency of occurrence (days per
month) for these situations taken from 1949 to 1997
and averaged for 3- (December–February, June–
August) and 5-month (November–March, May–Se p -
tember) winter or summer periods. To estimate the
linear relationship with ENSO, time series of SOI
were subjected to the same kind of averaging. It
should be noted that the years 1990 and 1992 are
missing from the Polyakova’s calendar. This was
taken into account when the SOI time series were
composed. The occurrence of the six synoptic situ a -
tions is shown in Figure 16. It is easy to see that the
first four types occur more often than the last two
ones.
    The first two types, especially the Okhotsk-
Aleutian (OA) situation, meridional for the whole
North Pacific, correspond to the penetration of south
cyclones with characteristic weather patterns into
the northern Japan and southern Okhotsk Seas and
Kuril area of the Pacific. On the other hand, the i n -
ternal Okhotsk Sea is subjected to cold air mass
transport from Siberia in winter. This sharpens the
land–sea contrast and strengthens the winter mo n -
soon. The OA situation (Figure 10) represents the
classical meridional dipoles with a high pressure
ridge over the central Pacific from the subtropic to
su b arctic area and low pressure over the eastern and

western Pacific. Due to its high frequency of occu r -
rence it is often present in the monthly mean fields.
Northward tracks of south cyclones dominate over
the western and eastern Pacific Ocean. For the wes t -
ern Pacific, cyclones come from the Philippine Sea
through the Kuroshio–Oyashio area to the Kuril P a -
cific area, northern Japan and southern Okhotsk
Seas.
The Aleutian-Zonal (AZ) situation (Figure 11)
corresponds to a zonal dipole with low pressure in
the subarctic and high pressure in the subtropic P a -
cific representing a pattern of an active winter mo n -
soon. Northeastward cyclones move mostly along
the land–sea margin from the East China Sea
through the Japan Sea to the southern Okhotsk Sea
and then turn eastward to cross the subarctic Pacific.
Time series for the AZ situation winter mean fr e -
quency of occurrence shows both unlagged and
lagged (6 months ahead) negative correlation with
SOI. Correlation coefficients sa t isfy to a 95%-
confidence level and are equal to –0.047 and –0.44,
respectively, which means that the AZ situation is
more frequent during winter El Niño events.
The Cyclones Over the North Pacific (CN) sy n -
optic situation (Figure 12) reveals a meridional ci r -
culation pattern in the eastern Pacific with a western
position of the weakened Subtropic High Pressure,
northward cyclone tracks over the Eastern Pacific,
and eastward tracks over the Western Pacific.
The Northwest (NW) synoptic situation (Figure
13) exhibits an almost zonal circulation dipole pa t -
tern but still has asymmetric features. It is chara c -
terized by the southeastern position of Subtropic
High with eastward cyclone tracks over the Kur o -
shio–Oyashio Extension area in the western Pacific
and northeastward tracks over the eastern subarctic
Pacific. Both the CN and NW situations have a
similar effect on the Okhotsk Sea due to cyclone
tracks located over the southern Sea. The NW situ a -
tion frequency of occurrence shows a positive u n -
lagged correlation with SOI of 0.37, slightly above
the 95%-confidence level. It means that the NW
situation is less frequent during winter El Niño
events.
Two last synoptic situations (Figures 14 and 15)
are very rare events compared to the previous ones
(Figure 16). The Okhotsk–Hawaii (OH) situation
represents a kind of exotic feature of the atmo s -
phere circulation over the North Pacific. It exhibits
a diagonal dipole similar to an extreme phase of
PNA with low pressure over the subarctic and ce n -
tral Pacific and high pressure over North America.
The latter prevents northward propagation of the
cyclone in the eastern Pacific area. Subtropical High
Pressure is located in an extreme southwestern p o -
sition blocking the northward cyclone tracks in this
area. There are rather cold (subarctic) cyclones
above the Okhotsk Sea in winter.
The Southern-Zonal (SZ) situation (Figure 15)
corresponds to a zonal dipole with an extreme
southern position of the subarctic low pressure sy s -
tem, high pressure over the Bering Sea and Alaska,
eastward cyclone tracks in the subtropic Pacific area
and northeastward cyclone tracks over subarctic
eastern Pacific. Both these situations cause cold
winter air temperature anomalies in North America,
but their impact on the Northwest Pacific is not si g -
nif i cant.

occurrence is low during the winter El Niño event in
1966 and reaches its local minimum during the
winter El Niño events in 1973, 1983, 1987, and
1997, while it reaches local maxima in the summers
of 1952, 1958, 1966, 1973, 1983, 1987, and 1992
following the winter El Niño events of the same
years.
    Thus, years of El Niño events dominating in
winter are characterized by substantial anomalies in
an annual cycle of the extratropic synoptic circul a -
tion patterns over the North Pacific. It seems that
certain physical processes which control the acco m -
panying ENSO effects in winter atmosphere over
the mid-latitude Northwest Pacific are prominent in
the c y clone track changes.
7. Conclusions
When analyzing conventional SST anomalies for
the whole extratropic North Pacific (unfiltered
monthly mean SST anomalies including anomalies
of an annual cycle), the power spectrum has a
maximum at the ENSO scale and a lagged correl a -
tion with SOI dominates, with SST being 1.5–2
years behind or 1 year ahead of the Niño3 Index.
When analyzing interannual winter SST anomalies
for the whole extratropic North Pacific (low-pass
filtered wintertime monthly mean SST anomalies),
an unlagged correlation with ENSO dominates and
both ENSO and decadal scale variations are r e -
vealed.
In both cases the first CEOFs have maximums in
the eastern and central Pacific while the second
CEOFs are located in the Northwest Pacific. Ho w -
ever, for the interannual winter SST anomalies the
spatial core of the second mode is shifted to the
north and confined in the transition area between the
Oyashio and Kuroshio Currents where the most i n -
tensive ocean–atmosphere interaction takes place in
winter. Presence of both decadal and ENSO vari a -
tions in the SST anomalies as well as its u n -
lagged/lagged significant correlation implies poss i -
ble feedback between low-frequency variations of
the two mentioned time scales in the mid-latitude
Pacific and particularly in the Northwest Pacific
also outlined by Sekine (1998).
The significant local maximums of the ENSO
scale in spectra of monthly mean air temperature are
pronounced for most of the seasons and meteor o -
logical stations in the Northwest Pacific Margin.
Nevertheless, air temperature and SOI are related, in
a different way, in the southern (South Japan Sea
coast and Korean Peninsula), mid (Okhotsk Sea
coast and Kamchatka Peninsula) and northern
(Bering Sea coast and Chukchy Peninsula) areas.
The principal difference is associated with the
asymmetry of seasonal temperature anomalies in an
annual cycle. Air temperature over the southern J a -
pan Sea is under greater infl u ence to ENSO-

accompanying dynamic processes in the extratrop i -
cal summer atmosphere, while air temperature over
the northern Japan Sea, Okhotsk Sea and Ka m -
chatka Peninsula is mostly subjected to the impact
of the ENSO accompanying processes in the winter
atmosphere.
According to air temperature and SST analyses,
one can suggest that ENSO and decadal scale vari a -
tions in the North Pacific are connected via both
annual–biennial oscillations of the Asian monsoon
system and ocean–atmosphere interaction in the
western mid-latitude ( subarctic/ subtropic) and ce n -
tral subtropic P a cific.
ENSO-accompanying processes in the Northwest
Pacific increase frequency of occurrence of certain
synoptic circulation patterns over the North Pacific
associated mainly with cyclone track changes in the
western margin. The ENSO signal with the lag of
about half a year is associated with the Northwest
Pacific ocean memory in a seasonal cycle. The
ENSO signal with the lag of about one year is
probably conditioned by both oceanic SST anom a -
lies propagating from the tropic–equatorial Pacific
to the extratropic areas and by the atmosphere ci r -
culation response to these anomalies.

Every few months since July 1997 we have made
CTD/ADCP sections off Newport, Oregon (44.6   N)
from the coast to 150 km; a base of historical
(1962–69) hydrographic data exists for this section.
See our website (Monitoring the Coastal Ocean off
Oregon: El Niño and beyond) under
http://www.oce.orst.edu/po/coastal.html
The surface layer off Oregon was already warmer
than normal in July 1997 (Figure 1a). The largest
anomalies (>6   C) occurred offshore (>90 km) in
July 1997, and inshore (<50 km) in September 1997
(Figure 1a). In September 1997, the surface layer
was everywhere warm (>17   C) with low salinity;
subsurface slope waters were >1ºC above normal
with an isotherm slope indicating northward adve c -
tion (Figure 1a). In November 1997 (Figure 1a), the
surface layer was 1   C warmer than normal; subsu r -
face waters over the slope were even warmer than in
September and steric height rose steeply toward
shore over 60 km, consistent with strong northward
flow on the shelf (Figure 2). In February 1998 (Fi g -
ure 1a), all water on the shelf was >12   C (>2   C
above normal). Temperatures over the shelf r e -
mained above normal from July 1997 to June 1998
but were near normal by August 1998 (Figure 1b).
Temperature and salinity fields suggest that u p -
welling was suppressed from September 1997 to
June 1998. (The PFEL Upwelling Index for 45   N
was negative or anomalously weak from June 1997
to June 1998.)  Subsurface waters over the upper
slope (100–400 m ) remained warmer than normal
from July 1997 through September 1998 (Figure 1).
The winter and spring sections showed evidence of
enhanced poleward advection, with a local anomaly
maximum near the shelf break. The geostrophic cu r -
rents were consistent with ADCP data (Figure 3)
showing a strong current jet flowing poleward b e -
yond the shelf break off Newport during the El Niño
winter (November 1997 and February 1998).  This
poleward jet was surface-intensified with speed
~ 0.5 m/s, width ~ 20 km, and extending to depths
> 200 m.  By August 1998 the equatorward surface
jet associated with normal coastal upwelling was
present over the shelf, shelf temperatures were near
normal, and the upwelling index was above the
mean for August and September 1998.
Sections were also made at several latitudes b e -
tween Newport, Oregon and San Francisco, Califo r -
nia in November 1997, April 1998, and August
1998. These extended cruises showed much alon g -
shore homogeneity. In November 1997, sections at
39   , 42   , 43.2   , and 44.7   N all showed the steric
height of the sea surface rising steeply toward shore
(~20 cm in ~ 60 km), while the 7   and 8   C is o -
therms slanted down toward the continental slope,
indicating enhanced poleward flow over the shelf
and upper slope (Figure 2). In April 1998, steric
height profiles were flat (at 39   and 44.7   N) or
slanting down toward the coast (at 42   and 43.2   N),
indicating that the anomalous poleward flow had
weakened or ceased. In August 1998, these sections
show evidence of near-normal coastal upwelling
inshore although subsurface waters offshore r e -
mained warmer than normal; they also show the
6.5   and 9   C isotherms diverging toward shore,
suggesting geostrophic poleward flow with a su b -
surface core offshore of the continental slope. At this time, the ADCP observations along each section
showed a band of poleward flow 20–40 km wide,
with a subsurface maximum centered at 150–200 m,
typical of the scales of the poleward undercurrent
but with the core of the flow detached from the co n -
tinental slope and offshore of the shelf break by 15
to 40 km (Figure 3).
Satellite-tracked drifters ( drogued at 15 m) were
released off Newport on all of the 1998 cruises
(Figure 4). Eight drifters released off Newport in
January 1998 (Figure 4a) moved coherently to the
north, with strongest (up to 0.65 m/s) poleward flow
near the continental shelf break. Four eventually
beached between 47   and 56   N, one was still off
Vancouver Island in October, and two reached
49.5   N (and one 48   N) before reversing direction
about 1 March. These observations are consistent
with above normal sea level, warm water and e n -
hanced poleward advection typical of El Niño co n -
ditions in winter. Of the seven drifters released off
Newport in April 1998 (Figure 4b), the five released
over the shelf and slope were advected by variable
wind-driven currents, including some initial nort h -
ward motion. Through August and September most
drifters were moving equatorward and offshore, d e -
lineating the meandering jets of the California Cu r -
rent (Figure 4f); by October some drifters from the
January, April, June and August releases off Ne w -
port (44.6   N) were between 35   and 39   N (Figure
4a–d). The drifters released in late September (Fi g -
ure 4e) initially moved offshore and southward but,
with the onset of fall storms, have not yet shown
consistent traje c tories.

Biological Effects of the 1997–1998 EL Niño Event off Oregon:
Nutrient and Chlorophyll Distributions

Abstract
As part of the west coast GLOBEC long-term observation program we began measuring nutrient and
chlorophyll distributions off the Oregon coast in July 1997.   Three types of sampling have been
co n ducted: a broad scale sampling in July 1997 (with R. Emmett, NOAA/NMFS) included eleven
tra n sects extending from the shore to 120 mi. offshore, high frequency sampling along the Newport
h y droline (with B. Peterson, NOAA/NMFS), and additional sampling along 1–5 other transects every few
months (with R. Smith et al. Oregon State University).    General features of the broad scale su r vey
include evidence of more upwelling, increased nutrients and higher chlorophyll in the southern half of the
region compared with the northern half.  High frequency sampling along the Newport h y droline showed
less upwelling, lower nutrients and lower chlorophyll compared to non-El Niño years.  Comparison of the
nutrient and chlorophyll distributions with physical data will be presented to su g gest the magnitude of the
impact of changes in upwelling dyna m ics on primary production.
Goals of the biological studies of the Northeast Pacific (NEP) GLOBEC and El Niño sampling are to
address three questions:
1. How do shifts in climate affect the distribution of nutrients and primary production?
2. How did the 1997–1998 El Niño condition affect nutrients and primary production off Oregon?
3. How do variations in physical and biological processes off Oregon affect poleward moving coastal
and California Current waters?
Methods
We used three spatial/temporal schemes for
sampling. During July 1997 we sampled 11
tra n sects extending from 42–47°N and 124–127°W
(Fig. 1).  Our NEP-GLOBEC sampling included 2–
5 transects off Oregon and northern California
(Figure 1) during September and November 1997,
and January, April, and August 1998.  In addition,
high-frequency sampling (once or twice a month)
was carried out along the inner portion of the
Newport line (Figure 1).
Results
The spatial distribution of temperature, nitrate,
chlorophyll, and organic carbon in surface water
(43–47   N and 124–127   W) is shown in Figure 2.
Characteristics allow us to distinguish four regions
as summarized in Table 1.
High-frequency sampling along the Newport
transect showed that El Niño conditions resulted
in a 2   C increase in surface temperature (Figure
3), a 50% reduction in integrated nitrate (Figure
4), and a 70% reduction in integrated chlorophyll
(Figure 5).
Results from the September 1997 GLOBEC
Newport transect confirm the low nutrient levels
in the upper 20–30 m along the Newport line all
the way from 160 m offshore to the coastline
(Figure 6).  These low-nutrient conditions were
accomp a nied with low chlorophyll levels and a
subsurface chlorophyll maximum at about 30 m
(where n i trate levels were about 1 mM) (Figure 6).
By August 1998 normal upwelling conditions had
returned, accompanied by much higher
chlorophyll levels throughout the water column
and a chlorophyll maximum in the surface water
near the coastline (Figure 6).
The chlorophyll, carbon, and nutrient samples were collected from 3 meters 
below the surface.  Temperature data were taken by hand and reflect 
actual surface values.

Conclusions and Future Work
The 1997–1998 El Niño resulted in si g nificantly
warmer and nutrient depleted water off the coast of
Oregon.  The low levels of nutr i ents are probably
the primary cause for the r e duced levels of
chlorophyll and primary produ c tion.  By August
1998 conditions had returned to normal in terms of
the total standing stock of chlorophyll and the
patterns of distribution with depth.
During the next two years of sampling we hope to
provide further analysis of the causes and
consequences of variations in lower trophic level
activity along the coast of Oregon and its influence
on the characteristics of southward flowing water in
the California Current.

I had the good fortune to initiate monitoring of
hydrography and zooplankton offshore of Newport,
Oregon prior to the 1997–98 El Niño event.  St a -
tions 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 miles off Newport (44º 40'N)
were sampled biweekly beginning in May 1996.
The zooplankton at these same stations were sa m -
pled repeatedly from 1969–1973 and in 1978 thus
providing a baseline to which modern measur e -
ments could be compared.  In this brief note, I co m -
pare present obse r vations to data from the 1970s.
In 1997, upwelling began as usual in late March
indicating the onset of the spring transition.  A
boom in zooplankton production followed in April.
In May, northerly winds weakened, upwelling r e -
laxed, Columbia River Plume Water moved onto the
shelf, and zooplankton numbers began to decline.
The intrusion of warm Columbia River Plume Water
was indicated by a salinity minimum in June (Figure
1).   A minor upwelling event occurred in mid-June
and a third (and final) upwelling event lasting

five weeks occurred from 12 July through 19
August.  The latter showed little biological r e -
sponse; subsequently, upwelling ceased altogether. Sea surface temperatures on the shelf warmed from
12º to 17ºC during the period of extended relaxation
from  May until mid-July.  Surface waters cooled to
10ºC during the July/August upwelling event.  From
20–26 August, a strong southwesterly storm moved
north along the Oregon coast, resulting in a large
downwelling event, with warm waters penetrating to
near the sea floor at our baseline station at NH 5
(Figure 1).  Surface waters warmed to a record te m -
perature of 18.5ºC, warmer by 1 degree than any
observation made during the 1983 El Niño event
(Figure 2a, b, c), and warmer than 5ºC compared to
climatological temperatures measured at this same
station in the early 1970s.  After the September
peak, the sea surface cooled rapidly and wintertime
temperatures were no warmer than 1–2ºC.
Secchi depths were deep during both the early
and late summer 1997 warm events, averaging 10 m
during June/July and exceeding 15 m during the
late-summer warming event.  Usual secchi depths
are on the order of 3–5 m during the summer u p -
welling season (Figure 3a, b).  During the winter of
1997–98 secchi depths remained deep, then shoaled
to 3–4 m in the summer of 1998.
The copepods captured in shelf waters during
April/May and during the July/August upwelling
events were boreal species.  During relaxation of
upwelling in May/June and August/September, sp e -
cies captured were those normally found in waters
offshore of Oregon (Table 1).  During the winter
months of 1997/98, the zooplankton were typical of
those expected with the Davidson Current — i.e.,
species with southern and offshore affinities.  In
spring 1998, these same southern and offshore sp e -
cies continued to dominant the zooplankton through
at least mid-June, chiefly because southwesterly
storms were frequent and upwelling had not become
firmly established.
In contrast to the 1982–83 El Niño, very few u n -
usual zooplankton, fish or bird species were seen in
Oregon’s coastal waters.  Thus, the greatest effect of
the 1997/98 El Niño on the zooplankton community
was firstly, a reduction in biomass and production of
local zooplankton species due to a shortened u p -
welling season in 1997, a delayed start of upwelling
in 1998, and secondly, changes in community
structure due to advection onshore of species which
are normally found off Northern California and/or in
waters well offshore of Oregon.   The “usual” boreal
coastal zooplankton species did not begin to i n -
crease in numbers until late July 1998; by Septe m -
ber, the most common and abundant species, Pse u -
docalanus mimus , Acartia clausii , A. longiremis , and Centropages abdominalis , had population sizes
only 10 to 20% of normal.

cies to the Or e gon shelf.

fold higher; numbers of Calanus marshallae are
lower by a factor of 2–3 (Figures 4 and 5).  A sim i -

The degree to which the warm water event of
late-summer 1997 is linked to the equatorial El Niño event remains an open question — there is evidence,
presented in the PICES/El Niño session by Jim
Overland, that the warming was due to anomalous
atmospheric patterns off the west coast of the U.S.
that may have been teleconnected to the equatorial
weather patterns associated with the movement of
the “warm pool” from the western Pacific to near
the dat e line. The effects of the “warm event” of the summer of
1997 on chlorophyll and copepod egg production
rates are discussed in Gomez- Gutiérrez and W. T.
Peterson (in press).

“warm event” is shown below :

During strong El Niño winters, sea levels along
the West Coast of Canada typically rise about 10 to
20 cm above seasonal heights and remain above
normal for several months. During the 1997/98 El
Niño, sea levels rose 10 cm in May 1997, 20 cm in
the autumn, and 30 cm in January and February
1998, all along the Pacific Coast of Canada.
Monthly average sea levels at Tofino, British C o -
lumbia (49   09 ¢N, 125   55 ¢W), during the 1997/98
El Niño (Figure 1) were as high as observed during
the 1982/83 El Niño, and were far above seasonal
values.  Only the January 1914 monthly mean
reached a height along Canadian shores comparable
to the four months of January and February 1983
and 1998. Pressure-adjusted sea levels are not
shown here, but were about 10 to 20 cm or so above
seasonal values in winter.
Figure 1.  Monthly average sea level at Tofino,
British Columbia (49   09'N, 125   55'W) for sixteen-
month periods in 1982–83, 1997–98, and for the
average seasonal cycle between 1975 and 1995 . The offshore extent of the rise in adjusted sea
level is evident in TOPEX/Poseidon satellite a l -
timetry data. This satellite measures sea surface el e -
vation relative to the ellipsoid, and adjusted (atmo s -
pheric pressure compensated) sea levels are
computed using air pressure data from global
weather analysis models.  We obtained 2-day delay
data (TOPEX only) from the National Ocean o -
graphic Data Center for Satellite Altimetry.  After
applying our own tidal corrections, we found that
adjusted sea levels on the continental shelf were
about 10 cm above normal at mid-continental shelf
during January and February 1998, and maintained
high levels well beyond the outer edge of the cont i -
nental shelf.  The rise was especially high off the
west coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands.
Off the west coast of North America, an upward
slope of the sea surface toward shore implies nort h -
ward transport, and usually northward transport of
heat.  TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) measurements pr o -
vide anomalies in sea surface elevations due to
barotropic and baroclinic currents in the water co l -
umn.  Water property measurements along Line-P
(Figure 2) provide measurements of dynamic
heights due to baroclinic currents. Comparisons of
these two types of measurement provide insight into
the relative contributions of baroclinic and bar o -
tropic motion. The Line-P stations 3, 9 and 13 are
45, 22 and 11 km respectively from T/P crossover
points (Figure 2).  A crossover point denotes the
geographical spot where the northwestward track of
the T/P satellite crosses the southeastward track of
this satellite. At these locations we have twice as
many data points. In addition, the sampling time
interval allows more accurate computation of tidal
heights, which must be removed from the record
prior to their use in non-tidal current studies.
Figure 3 presents T/P sea levels at three cross-
over points compared to dynamic heights at the
nearest Line-P station. The T/P data were provided
to us by NASA Ocean Altimeter Pathfinder Project.
Between September 1992 and the end of this record
in 1997 there were 194 cycles of T/P data, each pr o -
viding 2 o b servations at each of these three cross-
over points. We removed the tidal signals using our
own tidal analysis on these data, and also removed a
local 5.3-year mean at each crossover point. Finally,
we adjusted each of the three lines along the vertical
axis to remove a difference in the means in these
three comparisons with dynamic heights. Therefore
it is the variability about these means that provides
useful information.
The large triangles in this figure denote the ind i -
vidual dynamic heights of the sea surface relative to
1000-m depth as measured during vessel transects
along Line-P at stations 3, 9 and 13. Water prope r -
ties at station 4 below 730 m were transferred to
station 3 where the bottom depth is only 730 m. The
other two stations are in water deeper than 1000 m.
Line-P station 3 lies on the near-shore side of the
continental shelf. It is 45 km away from the nearest
satellite crossover point station, which is beyond the
outer edge of the continental shelf.  We believe this
separation accounts for the generally higher winter
sea levels observed in T/P data compared to the d y -
namic heights, since winter sea level elevations are
typically higher near shore than along the outer
shelf. Although T/P data extend only to the last few
days of 1997, they clearly show the sea level rise
during the 1997/98 El Niño, in autumn and early
winter.
The line-P stations plotted in the bottom two
graphs in Figure 3 lie closer to cross-over points and
therefore the dynamic height variability follows the
T/P sea levels more closely.  At station 13 where the
separation is only 11 km, the rms difference b e -
tween T/P sea levels and dynamic heights is only
3.0 cm.
Of interest here is the phase reversal in seasonal
cycles between stations 3 and 9 in Figure 3.  Ekman
divergence associated with the build-up of the
Aleutian low pressure system in winter generally
lowers sea levels in mid Gulf of Alaska, as observed
at T/P crossover points at 49.014   N, 128.978   W,
and 49.014   N, 131.811   W.  However, the near-
shore winds in this low pressure system blow in a
direction that pushes currents to the north and raises
sea level on the continental shelf in winter, as o b -
served at the T/P crossover point at 49.014   N,
126.142   W.

and new Line-P station numbers are pr e sented. The new station numbers (1 to 26) are used in this paper.
Figure 3.  Time series of T/P sea level (dotted line) at track crossovers near Line P stations 3, 9, and 13 (see
Figure 1) during September 1992–December 1997. Dotted lines joint every available point; small triangles
are averages over ascending-descending pairs; thick solid lines are 5-point running medians. Triangles
show Line-P dynamic topography ( steric height) values relative to 1000 m.
We have examined records of dynamic topogr a -
phy from 35 winter cruises along Line-P between
1969 and 1998.  In February 1998, at Line-P station
4 in 1300 m of water, the surface dynamic height
relative to 1000 m was 10 cm higher than observed
during any of the other 34 cruises. Second and third
highest levels were found in the winters of 1992 and
1987 respectively.  These three highest values were
observed during recent El Niño winters, and we e x -
pect that northward transport of heat during the past
decade may have been significantly above normal
due to these El Niño-related events.
We have applied our own tidal corrections to T/P
data because the normal T/P data products use tidal
constituents provided by global tidal models.  Typ i -
cally, these models are inaccurate over continental
shelves.  In deeper waters the global tidal models
provide reasonable de-tiding of records for exam i -
nation of large-amplitude features. One such feature
observed is an eddy that began off the west coast of
the Queen Charlotte Islands in February 1998. An
image of this eddy, as observed by TOPEX and
ERS-2 imagery, is provided in Figure 4.
This eddy is the largest of several that began in
the past El Niño winter.  A recent modelling study
suggests these eddies are more frequent during El
Niño winters when northward transport along the
Canadian and Alaskan coast is stronger ( Melsom,
Meyers, Hurlburt, Metzger and O'Brien personal
communication, 1998). An Electronic version of
this manuscript can be found at web site
http://www.coaps.fsu.edu/~stricher/EI_revision/ .)
The T/P and ERS-2 record shows such eddies to be
spawned off this coast almost every winter.
After generation in February 1998 off the Queen
Charlotte Islands, the eddy moved westward until
mid April. Whereas most such eddies in other years
track westward, this one moved southward between
April 1998 and press time in December 1998. Based
on studies of other eddies, it is expected to survive
for at least a year and possibly as long as three
years.
A Line-P cruise through this eddy in September
1998 showed it to be more than 1000 m deep, with
water characteristics typical of the West Coast of the
Queen Charlotte Islands in winter.  It might be a
major source of nutrients for waters above and in
the upper thermocline.

The Institute of Ocean Sciences, or its predece s -
sors, have occupied a series of 26 stations extending
from the mouth of the Juan de Fuca Strait to Ocean
Station Papa, at 50°N and 145°W, since 1956.  This
line of stations is commonly called Line-P (see Fi g -
ure 1).  In the early years the line was occupied
many times per year, but in recent years the line is
routinely occupied in February, May and August of
each year.  The value of this long time series b e -
came particularly evident during the El Niño event
of 1997/98 as we had good control over the defin i -
tion of “normal” co n ditions along Line-P. Having a definition of “normal” evidently allows
the definition of a mean field and thence, an ano m -
aly.  In Figure 2 we show a plot of the temperature
anomaly field associated with the 1982/83 El Niño
event.  It was astonishing that the temperature
anomalies penetrated so deep.  Ideally one would
like to have computed the velocity anomalies ass o -
ciated with this event.  We can compute velocity
fields for both the mean state and for the observed
conditions in March 1983, and subtract one from the
other.  The result makes no sense and is not shown
here.  The obvious conclusion from this exercise is
that in that calculation we are missing a large bar o -
tropic signal associated with the 1982/83 event.
In the remainder of this note we will attempt to
outline the evolution of the scalar fields through the
1997/98 El Niño event.  We will then use
TOPEX/Poseidon data to allow a more realistic e s -
timate of the velocity anomaly field, and from that
an estimate will be made of the anomalous heat flux
associated with this El Niño event.  In describing
the evolution of the scalar fields we were greatly
assisted by the existence of the Department of Fis h -
eries and Oceans (DFO) El Niño Watch Program.
This allowed us to use new resources to increase the
sampling along Line-P. Thus, we have 10 anomaly
sections between August 1997 and July 1998, incl u -
sive.  Some of these were obtained as part of the
routine scientific surveys along Line-P. Some were

partial surveys, courtesy of the Canadian Coast
Guard, and some were shallow surveys along the
entire length of Line-P, courtesy of Department of
National Defence AXBT surveys.  By this means,
the 1997/98 El Niño was observed more thoroughly
than any previous cl i mate event.
Figure 3 shows a selection of images illustrating
the development of the 1997/98 El Niño of British
Columbia.  The first period, February 1997, shows
conditions in the N.E. Pacific Ocean before the El
Niño began.  As expected, sea surface temperature
anomalies are weak throughout the area of concern,
and temperature anomalies are small along Line-P,
at all depths.  A significant salinity anomaly is vis i -
ble as a longitudinal feature near a pressure of 120
dbar. This is reflected by the general shallowing of
the mixed layer in the N.E. Pacific that has been
reported elsewhere.  By the autumn of 1997 a major
warming event has occurred throughout the Pacific
and we see extensive coastal warming throughout
the N.E. Pacific  The warming is visible at the su r -
face but shows no penetration below the top few
tens of metres.  Again, as in February 1997, the only
significant salinity anomaly is due to the shallow
mixed layer, compared with the 1956 to present
climatology.  By the fall of 1997 the sea surface
height was a little above normal, but shortly afte r -
wards sea surface height anomalies began to grow
rapidly (see paper by Crawford in this report). Coi n -
cident with this large change in sea level we began
to see temperature anomalies at depth through the
winter of 1997/98. This is illustrated in Figure 3
with the sections for February 1998, which is ch o -
sen to be the time when sea level reached its greatest
height above normal. At this period, sea surface
temperature anomalies remain large throughout the
coastal regions of North America, but now the lar g -
est subsurface temperature anomalies appear, both
suggestive of northward a d vection along the coast.

Figure 3.  Sea surface temperature (SST ), and cross-sections of temperature and salinity anomaly for February
1997, September 1997 and February 1998. The solid line on the SST maps shows the position of Line-P.
We suggest that the early, superficial warming in
the N.E. Pacific is due to an atmospheric teleco n -
nection and that this superficial warming induced a
small sea level change owing to thermal expansion.
The sea level change seen after November 1997 is
far larger than could be explained by thermal expa n -
sion, and we propose that this event is due to the
arrival of a Kelvin wave from the south.  This fits
with the observations of a deep anomaly appearing
during the wi n ter of 1997/98.
We can estimate the velocity anomaly field in the
following way:
Absolute velocity = (g/f) · (surface pressure grad i -
ent) + ( geostrophic velocity computed relative to the
su r face).
We can calculate the geostrophic velocity field
(relative to the surface) both from the February 1998
observations, and the long-term mean fields for Fe b -
ruary, set up the above equation for both February
1998 and the long-term mean and look at the diffe r -
ence, thus:
Velocity anomaly = (g/f) · (surface pressure grad i -
ent anomaly) + ( geostrophic velocity anomaly rel a -
tive to the surface).
The surface pressure anomaly is strictly not
known, but here we choose to represent that by the
difference in sea level as seen by TOPEX/Poseidon,
between February 1998 and February 1997, i.e. El
Niño sea level minus pre-El Niño sea level.  Then,
having computed the velocity anomaly ( v ´), we can
multiply by the temperature anomaly field ( T ´) to
estimate the heat flux anomaly, T ´ v ´.
The velocity anomaly field illustrated above is
supported by various ancillary observations.  Cu r -
rent meters on the continental slope installed in su p -
port of the DFO El Niño Watch Program suggest
very clearly that flows at the shelf edge were
anomalous and that the typical northward flow in
February 1998 was about 10 cm/s above normal.
Profiling Alace floats deployed near Station Papa
suggest that any velocity anomaly is in the direction
along Line-P, with near zero anomaly perpendicular
to Line-P. The heat flux in Figure 4 are in cgs units.  Int e -
grating under the contour of T ¢v ¢ = 1.0 cal s
–1 cm
–2 we estimate the total heat flux transported by the El
Niño ocean signal in February 1998 as 6.8 · 10 12 cal
s
–1 .  To give some idea of the magnitude of this flux,
it would be sufficient to warm the coastal area north
of Line-P 200 km from the coast and to a depth of
200 metres by 1°C in 70 days.  It would be inte r -
esting to run a model analysis of the ocean response
in 1997/98 and estimate the total heat required in the
ocean, north of Line-P.  By this means we should be
able to estimate the importance of the oceanic tel e -
connection in the high latitude ocean response.

In summary, we successfully observed the evol u -
tion of the temperature and salinity anomalies off
the coast of British Columbia as various phases of
the El Niño affected the coastal regions.  The late
response may be an oceanic Kelvin wave that tran s -
ports heat to the north.  We have estimated the heat
flux associated with this event and would like to
make a comparison with model analyses.

Over the past few decades, surface waters of the
Gulf of Alaska have been gently warming.  In the
1990s, we are also setting records for warmest w a -
ters since observations began in the 1930s.  Coastal
temperatures at British Columbia lighthouses (e.g.
Amphitrite Point and Kains Island, Figure 1) were
very warm during the summer of 1997 (Figure 2),
besting previous temperature maxima by more than
1   C. The monthly averaged T at Amphitrite Point,
for example, was 16.0   C in September 1997, to p -
ping the 1979 record of 14.9   C.  Coastal trends ge n -
erally mimic that seen in equatorial waters.  In both
regions, warming is measured over time, and per i -
odic El Niños produce major warm anomalies.  A
notable exception is that the 1972 El Niño does not
appear in Lighthouse te m perature records.
In open ocean, the highest measured winter te m -
peratures were observed in 1994.  Coincident with
this was a thinning of the mixed layer (a trend
Freeland et al. (1997) have observed over the past
40 years at Ocean Station Papa (OSP)) and a redu c -
tion in the nutrient supply to the mixed layer (Whi t -
ney et al., 1998).  As a result of reduced winter n u -
trient supply, nitrate depletion has become more
widespread in the 1990s.  Between 1989 and 1994,
nitrate depletion spread from 250 km to almost 600
km offshore along Line P.  This loss of nutrient has
resulted in abnormally low chlorophyll levels in
recent summers (Figure 3) compared with the recent
average, and a substantial reduction in primary pr o -
ductivity in late summer (Whitney et al., 1998).
This work allowed estimates of loss of new pr o -
duction in an area covering 290,000 km
2 off the
coast of Vancouver Island.  Between 1989 and
1994, a decline of about 2 million tonnes of phyt o -
plankton carbon was calculated.  However, surveys
had not been made along the coast of Alaska during
this period.  When it was evident that a major El
Niño was building in 1997, more detailed sampling
was begun both along Line P and to the north coasts
of B.C. and Alaska.  Over the past couple of years,
we have been able to chart the area that experiences
nitrate depletion in summer (Figure 1), and now see
that virtually all the shelf waters in the Gulf are a f -
fected.
More frequent surveys along Line P provided
much better seasonality to nutrient supply and util i -
zation.  On the shelf, 1997–98 winter nutrient levels
were less than half those of an average year in the
1970s, and nitrate depletion occurred in April rather
than May (Figure 4).  It also appears that coastal
upwelling has been much weaker through the su m -
mer of 1998, since nutrient levels remained low.
This trend was also seen in open ocean stations, to
at least 225 km offshore.
Assuming that nutrient deficiency is spreading in
the Gulf of Alaska, much the same way it has been
along Line P, then shelf productivity has been su b -
stantially impacted. B.C. juvenile salmon are known
to spend several months in coastal waters as they
migrate northward through spring and summer (D.
Welch, unpublished data).  The weakened nutrient
supply suggests that they are migrating through
water that may have only 50 to 60% of the primary
production that was seen in the 1970s.  The decline
in open ocean survival (Welch et al., submitted) of
some of these stocks in the 1990s may be linked to
changes in coastal nutr i tion.

respond to nitrate-depleted waters ; high coastal values to upwelling.
A result of mixed layer thinning is the increase in
average light levels that phytoplankton receive,
which would advance the onset of spring growth (as
suggested in Freeland et al. (1997)) and should
stimulate earlier development of grazers.  Mackas et
al. (1998) have observed a 2 month earlier deve l -
opment of one of the major subarctic Pacific cop e -
pods, Neocalanus plumchrus , at OSP.  Such shifts in
communities must create mismatches in timing of
predator and prey intera c tions.
    Thus the changes we have been observing in
coastal and open ocean in the Gulf of Alaska are
consistent with a warming of surface waters.  The
increased buoyancy of the mixed layer results in less
winter supply of nutrient, which decreases the
amount of phytoplankton biomass that is produced,
which in turn impacts the productivity of the entire
r e gion.

Dissolved Gas Measurements at Stn. P4 during the 97–98 El Niño

Preliminary results and interpretation of mea s -
urements obtained at the N.E. Pacific El Niño monitoring station P4 during September 1997 to
May 1998 are presented.  Station P4 is situated in
the vicinity of 48   39' N and 126   40' W approx i -
mately 75 km west of Vancouver Island, British
Columbia, Canada in a water depth of approx i -
mately 1 ,300 m.  An instrument package, consisting
of a SBE16 DO CTD and an upward-looking sonar,
was deployed on a subsurface mooring at a mean
depth of ~20 m.  Time series measurements, r e -
corded with a 1-h sampling period, include total
dissolved air pressure or gas tension, dissolved ox y -
gen and nitrogen concentrations, fluorescence, water
temperature and salinity, and acoustical back-scatter
intensity.
Data Overview
Figure 1 displays a summary of the data.  The i n -
strument package remained at around 20 m depth
for the majority of the deployment, although it was
drawn down to depths in excess of 50 m for a short
period during a storm on year day 415.  Water te m -
peratures in November 1997 (year day 280) were
around 15   C.  Water temperature at 20 m depth
continued to cool until mid-January 1998 (year day
380).  Dissolved oxygen, measured by a Beckman
probe on the SBE16, appeared super-saturated by
approximately 20–30% for the first 25–30 days of
the deployment and then remained reasonably st a -
ble, close to saturation.  Winkler calibration samples
are indicated.  The initial decline in dissolved ox y -
gen concentration is suspect and probably assoc i -
ated with a calibration change during what appears
to be a ‘settling in’ period of the sensor.  This is a p -
parent by comparing the dissolved oxygen sensor
measurements with the gas tension signal as fo l -
lows.
Gas tension is the dissolved air pressure.  The sig-
nal is approximately 20% p O
2 (dissolved) and 80%
p N
2 (dissolved).  As dissolved N
2 is relatively bi o -
logically inert, the sensor responds, like an oxygen
sensor, to variations in dissolved oxygen concentr a -
tion.  The accuracy of the gas tension measurement,
however, is remarkable.  Its absolute error is –
0.01% yr
–1 (the error bar is thinner than the plotted
line).  Unfortunately it stopped working on day 450
due to a pressure housing leak, but not before the
spring bloom.
A bloom event is identified during mid-March,
lasting approximately 10 days.  The bloom is r e -
flected in the dissolved oxygen measurements, the
gas tension measurements and the fluorometer
measurements, providing three completely ind e -
pendent means of determining the timing, duration
and size of the bloom.  We used a WETLABS
WETStar fluorometer.  The calibrations appear good
( cf. , bottle sample).  The fall bloom and spring
bloom periods are identified.  The spring bloom o c -
curs shortly after a storm.  The bloom appears to be
triggered by a very calm period when there is no
significant surface wave activity or bubble plume
penetration (to be discussed).  Peak Chl levels of ~ 4
mg l
–1 were recorded.
The meteorological and wave measurements we
use are from the Environment Canada buoy # 46206
located at 48   50' N and 125   60' W.  Shown also for
comparison is a time series of the power at the ine r -
tial period ( f
I
) of the CTD pressure period, which
serves as a crude indicator of storm activity.  Bubble
cloud penetration depth is measured using an u p -
ward-looking sonar at 200 kHz, located at the top of
the mooring with an unobscured view of the su r face.
These data may be compared with historical
measurements and differences interpreted in terms
of the impact of the El- Niño on N.E. Pacific pr o -
ducti v ity.
Historical Measurements
Figure 2 displays CTD casts taken during Jan u -
ary, February and March 1998 at Stn. P4.  The effect
of the El Niño is clearly seen in the unusually warm
and saltier surface waters, reaching peak levels
sometime during February.  Note that the surface
waters at 150 m are changing temperature by 3   C
during January to March.
Our data are presented in Figure 3 and compared
with the historical annual average at Stn. P4 and
indicate the waters at 20 m depth are approximately
3   C warmer than usual and saltier by approximately
0.5.  Shown as error bars on the historical data are
the standard devi a tions.

Primary Production Estimates
What is the primary production rate derived from
these data?  There are two preliminary comparisons
to make:
1. daily change in Chl concentrations,
2. daily change in dissolved O
2 concentr a tions.
Assuming a C :Chl ratio by weight of 60 and the
observed change in Chl (inferred from fluorescence
changes) of say 1 ug l
–1 day
–1 , we calculate a pr i -
mary production rate of 1.2 gC m
–2 day
–1 assuming a
20-m layer depth.  Such an estimate is crude as it
does not account for daily redistribution of the bi o -
mass, changes in the fluorescence with time of day
or grazing by zooplankton.
Similar calculations can be made using the o b -
served dissolved oxygen changes.  Again, we n e -
glect redistribution of oxygenated water and bi o -
mass and assume that mixing extends to h = 20 m
depth.  From the observed daily saturation level
change in dissolved oxygen of D s = 20%, and the
mean dissolved oxygen solubility ,  b = 280 mmol
m
–3
, we may estimate the productivity as h bDs / Dt
( McNeil and Farmer, 1995).  This leads to a net
production rate of 1.12 molO
2 m
–2 day
–1 .  Using a
photosynthetic quotient, PQ = O
2 :CO
2 , of 1.2 (typ i -
cally in the range of 1.1–1.2; Kirk, 1983) would i m -
ply a carbon production rate of 0.93 mol CO
2 m
–2 day
–1 , or 11 gC m
–2 day
–1
.  This is a factor of ten
times more than that derived from the change in
fluore s cence.
The above analysis indicates the levels of unce r -
tainty associated with these kinds of estimates.  We
do, however, expect the estimate derived from flu o -
rescence to be less than that derived from oxygen as
fluorescence is typically quenched during the day as
a result of light exposure ( Denman and Gargett,
1988).  The magnitude of this effect is not known
for these data.  It would, therefore, be inappropriate
to combine the above results to infer a C :Chl ratio.
We note once again that dissolved oxygen has been
measured by two independent methods and both
methods provide the same result giving credibility
to this production estimate during the bloom of 11
gC m
–2
 day
–1 . Questions to be Addressed Several questions have been identified by this
preliminary look at the data:
– How will primary production estimates from
these data compare with sediment trap data at
the site?
– Is the timing of the spring bloom, or the ma g -
nitude of the spring bloom, different from
non El Niño years?
– Is the export efficiency of carbon from the
upper ocean different between El Niño and
non El Niño years?
We invite other investigators to help address
these questions through correspondence and data
comparison.

Introduction
The primary goal of this study was to document
effects of the 1997/1998 El Niño event on intertidal
macroalgal abundance in Barkley Sound, British
Columbia, Canada. Population fluctuations in the
dominant intertidal kelp species Hedophyllum se s -
sile were documented from June 1991 to May 1998.
The extensive baseline data prior to 1997 provides a
database to evaluate current intertidal kelp popul a -
tion trends from summer 1997 to the present.  The
authors recognize that the spatial scale of this survey
is limited.  However, this data set is unique for
Barkley Sound since it is the only known long-term
population study compiled for this geographic area.
Eight sites were sampled in Trevor Channel (Figure
1).  The most detailed surveys were taken at four
sites on Pr a siola Point.
These data provide a solid baseline against which
present trends in macroalgal biomass and densities
can be compared.  The 1997/1998 El Niño increased
coastal, Northeast Pacific water temperatures during
approximately May 1997 to March 1998.  The peak
temperatures ranged from 17
o C to more than 18
o C
(unpublished data from the Institute of Ocean Sc i -
ences, Canada). These temperatures and associated
low nutrient levels (Zimmerman and Kremer, 1984)
have the potential to negatively affect the spor o -
phyte production and maintenance of kelp popul a -
tions. These Hedophyllum sessile data from before,
during, and after the 1997/1998 El Niño can thus be
used to evaluate impacts of this warm-water event
on kelp populations in the intertidal zone.
Hedophyllum sessile ( Laminariales, Phaeoph y -
ceae) is found in the mid- intertidal zone on shores in
the northeast Pacific Ocean, ranging from Attu I s -
land, Alaska to northern California ( Widdowson,
1965).  The juvenile plant has a short flattened stipe
(up to 5 cm) which rapidly disappears as the blade
becomes sessile on the holdfast.  Adult plants are
characterized by a large blade (up to 0 .6 m
2 total
surface area) and no stipe, attached by numerous
haptera (root-like attachment structures) arising
from the thickened basal margins of the plant. Juv e -
niles recruit in spring and summer months.  H. se s -
sile is a dominant intertidal kelp species which
forms dense canopies within which various invert e -
brate and fish species are found. For example, H.
sessile provides substratum and habitat for spaw n -
ing Pacific Herring.
Methods
Data collected
Data collected were: kelp percent cover, adult and
juvenile density, reproductive status, a biomass i n -
dex, and cover of various understory species. Data
on Hedophyllum sessile ’s adult and juvenile density
at Prasiola Point were included in this report b e -
cause they directly quantify mortality.  These data
were arranged in a time series to evaluate trends in
these p a rameters.
Figure 1.  Hedophyllum sessile sampling locations in Barkley Sound, British Columbia.  In total, eight sites
in Trevor Channel were sampled.  Four sites at Prasiola Point (encircled on the left-hand map of Trevor
Channel) were intensively studied. This report only includes data from Prasiola Point.
Historical data compiled
Historical data on juvenile and adult densities
were compiled from Druehl and Elliott (1996) and
from DeWreede’s macroalgal monitoring program
(unpublished data, see acknowledgments).  These
data were examined for continuous time series and
for compatibility of data sets between sites and
times.  Four sites from Druehl and Elliott (1996)
and all DeWreede’s sites (a total of four at Prasiola
Point) were chosen for re-sampling in spring 1998.
Druehl and Elliott’s sites were not analyzed for
trends because data were not consistent enough to
provide a reliable baseline.
Data collected and analyzed for post-El Niño
status Historical sites were visited in May 1998.  At
Prasiola Point, adult density and juvenile densities
(# per m
2 ) were quantified by randomly placing
twenty 0.25 m · 0.25 m quadrats on permanent
transect lines in the middle of the Hedophyllum se s -
sile zone.  All of the sites at Prasiola Point were
pooled to produce a single, continuous data series
from 1991 to 1998.   Because different sites at Pr a -
siola Point were sampled in different years, any
given date in the 1991–1998 time series had a total
of 20 quadrats, except in May 1998 when the total
number of quadrats sampled was 40.
Results
Juvenile and adult densities were negatively a f -
fected from June 1997 to February 1998 (Figures 2
and 3).  Peak recruitment normally occurs in late
spring/ early  summer months. June 1997 was unique
from all other sample dates because (in a site which
always had successful recruitment) it was the first
documented summer month with zero recruitment
(Figure 2). Data from the most recent field sampling
(May 1998) indicated that juvenile densities were
similar to those found in spring and summer months
in 1991 to 1996 (e.g. April and June 1996 ; Figure
2).
In May 1998, adult densities in previously dense
kelp beds were low and there was no apparent i n -
creasing trend in adult densities.  These beds will
only recover if the newly recruited juveniles  (in
May 1998; Figure 2) survive.
Conclusion
Recruitment of Hedophyllum sessile sporophytes
was measured on Prasiola Point in 1991, 1992,
1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998.  June 1997 was the
first summer date during this time period when there
was no recruitment.  Low juvenile densities were
reported in subsequent sample dates, with juvenile
densities recovering in May 1998.  The low 1997
recruitment event presumably correlates with effects
of El Niño-induced oceanographic conditions such
as high water temperature and associated low nutr i -
ent concentrations (Zimmerman and Kremer, 1984;
Deysher and Dean, 1986). Low sporophyte recrui t -
ment in 1997 was followed by low adult density.
Extremely low adult densities in May 1998 on Pr a -
siola Point may thus be a result of the previous
year’s recruitment failure.
These data suggest that Hedophyllum sessile was
negatively impacted from May 1997 to the present
and is recovering. This also indicates that if water
temperatures (and/or a correlated variable such as
nutrient concentrations) had remained at a level
which physiologically stresses algal production,
these kelp populations would continue to decline.
However, this prediction can only be appropriately
tested by monitoring other kelp beds in Barkley
Sound for trends related to water temperature (and
nutrient concentrations). This study also demo n -
strates that an extensive monitoring program for
inshore macroalgal habitats is a valuable tool for
evaluating effects of environmental change.

During the summer and autumn of 1997, sea su r -
face temperatures (SSTs) along the British Colu m -
bia coast and in the Gulf of Alaska were the war m -
est on record, and the return migration of sockeye
salmon to the Fraser River was unusually protracted
( McKinnell, 1997). Some sockeye salmon had d e -
veloped secondary sexual characteristics in the sea.
From northern California (Smith River) to northern
Vancouver Island, sockeye salmon were observed in
unusual abundance in rivers and streams where they
are not normally seen. Two hypotheses were deve l -
oped to explain these observations: (1) there had
been good survival of small local sea- and river-type
populations that had largely gone unnoticed by b i -
ologists, and/or (2) an unusually high number of the
abundant Fraser River sockeye salmon had strayed.
Samples of sockeye salmon (whole fish and/or ti s -
sues) were collected from 30 locations on Vanco u -
ver Island (~450 fish) and 4 locations in Oregon (45
fish) to investigate their origin. Of the whole fish
collected on Vancouver Island, most were spawned
out.
Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) variation in soc k -
eye salmon has been surveyed throughout the sp e -
cies’ range and baseline haplotype frequencies were
available from all major populations (36 sample
sites) spanning the region of interest from Queen
Charlotte Sound to the Columbia River (Wood, u n -
published data). Genetically similar populations
were pooled to form 11 “stocks”, the maximum
number that could be resolved with the 11 hapl o -
types observed in this region. Simulations with
mixtures of sockeye salmon of known origin were
conducted to determine the reliability of stock co m -
position estimates based on mtDNA variation
among the 11 stocks. Haplotype frequencies in
samples collected from rivers on the west coast of
Vancouver Island (WCVI), the east coast of Va n -
couver Island (ECVI), and Oregon were compared
with corresponding frequencies in the baseline to
determine first, whether non- Fraser sockeye salmon
haplotypes were present, and second, to estimate the
most likely contributions by each of the 11 stocks
using Statistical Program for Analyzing Mixtures
(SPAM). Where haplotype frequencies were co n -
sistent with significant contributions from Fraser
River fish, scale patterns were used to estimate co n -
tributions by individual populations within the
Fraser River using the baseline developed by the
Pacific Salmon Commission. Estimates of stock
composition from mtDNA and scale patterns were
then assessed for consistency with information on
age composition, run timing and parasites carried by
the sockeye.
Analyses of mtDNA (Figure 1) and scale patterns
(Figure 2) of sockeye salmon sampled from rivers
along the ECVI are consistent with the hypothesis
of straying Fraser River sockeye salmon; however,
there was also evidence of non- Fraser haplotypes in
these samples suggesting that a small fraction of the
sockeye salmon were of local origin. Age compos i -
tion (mostly age 1.2) and Myxobolus and Philonema
parasite incidence were consistent with sockeye of
Fraser River origin. On the other hand, analyses of
mtDNA haplotypes and scale patterns of sockeye
salmon sampled from rivers on the WCVI are not
consistent with the hypothesis of straying Fraser
River fish, suggesting an unusual recruitment to l o -
cal populations. Age composition data were similar
to Fraser River and other southern sockeye popul a -
tions. Parasite data were not available for these
samples.
The mtDNA haplotypes sampled from the
Deschutes River, Oregon ( n = 33) were those typ i -
cally found in many southern sockeye salmon
populations such as the Columbia and Fraser rivers.
The haplotype frequencies, however, were not typ i -
cal of populations sampled to date from either of
these rivers, with the possible exception of some
small populations in the lower Fraser River. The
date of sample collection in the Deschutes River
(mid-August) was earlier than would be expected
for sockeye salmon from the lower Fraser River. Of
two sockeye salmon sampled from the Rogue River,
Oregon, one contained a haplotype that is not found
in the Fraser River but is common in river-type
populations on the west coast of North America and
north of central British Columbia Four fish from the
Clackamas and two from the Klaskanine rivers had
haplotypes that are common in southern populations
and little can be said of their or i gin.
At least some Fraser River sockeye strayed.
These fish may have (1) begun their migration from
a location that was more distant than normal, or (2)
started their migration from a normal location but
took a longer route homeward, or (3) encountered
anomalous ocean currents that made their migration
more arduous, or (4) some combination of the
above. Homeward migration was likely abandoned
in favour of a more convenient river due to advan c -
ing sexual maturation.

“The Indians have told of catching pilchards in years long forgotten. None were around
when white men first set their nets; then they came back, and nobody knows why.  They
crowded the waters along the West Coast of Vancouver Island in ever larger numbers
after 1916.  The late twenties brought the big catches, and pilchard reduction plants
sprang up between Kyuquot and Barkley Sound.”
Forester and Forester, 1975
Sardines ( Sardinops sagax ) constituted the largest
fishery in British Columbia from the mid-1920s to
the mid-1940s.  During this period catches averaged
40,000 t annually (Figure 1).  The fishery off British
Columbia collapsed in 1947 and sardines disa p -
peared totally from British Columbia waters.  The
collapse of this fishery has been described as a cla s -
sic example of over-fishing ( Hilbourn and Walters,
1992). The complete absence of sardines in Can a -
dian and northern U.S. waters was never recognized
as a consequence of changes in species distribution.
Instead it was believed that overfishing in some way
eliminated every single fish.  It was also generally
believed that there was little prospect for the reco v -
ery of the fishery off the British Columbia coast b e -
cause supposedly it was the genetically distinct
northern migratory stock that had been overfished
(Murphy, 1966; MacCall, 1979). The remaining
biomass of this genetically distinct stock was co n -
sidered to be too small to rebuild.
Another explanation for the changes in abundance
of sardines was proposed by Kawasaki and Omori
(1988). They recognized that there was a synchrony
in the trends of abundance of sardine populations
off Japan, California and Chile (Figure 2) .The co l -
lapse of sardine stocks off Canada and the United
States in the late 1940s corresponded with the co l -
lapse off Japan. Beginning in the late 1970s the
stocks off Japan, California and Chile increased
dramatically. The synchrony persisted when stocks
declined off Chile and Japan in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, while off California the stocks have not
yet declined. The results of Kawasaki’s studies ind i -
cate that large fluctuations in sardine populations
are a consequence of changes in ocean habitat.
Shifts in climate/ocean regimes are now recognized
as important factors affecting the abundance trends
of a variety of fishes ( Beamish et al., 1998; Mantua
et al., 1997; Minobe, 1997).
Historically, sardines entered British Columbia
waters in mid-June and returned to southern
spawning grounds (California) in mid-October. Most spawning occurred from April to June in the
southern California Bight. It was primarily the older,
larger sardines, which migrated north to feed off

British Columbia. Hart (1943) noted that in a few
years, some sardines remained in the inlets off the
west coast of Vancouver Island throughout the wi n -
ter. In 1992, sardines reappeared in British Columbia
waters (Figure 3, Hargreaves et al., 1994) after a
total absence of over 40 years. Sardines were first
reported in 1992 in both commercial and research
catches of Pacific hake ( Merluccius productus ). The
catches in the hake fishery have continued through
to 1998, but are not an indication of sardine abu n -
dance as hake are fished at depths greater than 80 m,
well below the concentrations of sardines in the su r -
face waters (Figure 4). The sardines probably were
captured in the hake fishery when the nets were
pulled through the surface waters. In our research
surveys that began in 1997 we caught large numbers
of sardines in the surface waters relative to the
catches in the hake fishery (Figure 3). This may i n -
dicate that sardines were abundant in the surface
waters prior to 1997 and this is supported by the
initiation of an experimental commercial fishery in
1995 (Figure 3). Movement into the Canadian zone
may be continuing because sardines continue to
move farther north each year (Figure 5).
The abundance off British Columbia appears to
be increasing.  During July 1997, we estimated
abundance using large surface trawls ( Beamish and
Folkes, 1997) from the Columbia River to the tip of
Vancouver Island at 135,000t, of which approx i -
mately 60,000 t was present off the west coast of
Vancouver Island.  The 60,000 t represent approx i -
mately 250,000,000 sardines.  For comparison, a
catch of 1,800,000 coho salmon in the same area
was considered to satisfy conservation needs and
meet fishery expectations (DFO, 1985). This would
be equivalent to approximately 9,000,000 sardines
(the weight of 1 coho = the weight of 5 sardines).
The numbers of sardines present in 1997 indicated
that the abundance of fishes in the surface waters
had not only changed, but had increased.
The large abundance of sardines in the Canadian
zone in 1997 was observed prior to the major i n -
crease in temperature (August, September) of the
surface waters as a result of the 1997 El Niño. The
large abundance persisted off British Columbia
through 1998.  At the same time as large numbers of
sardines appeared off British Columbia, the total
abundance off California was considered to be u n -
changed (400,000 t).  Catches off California have
been maintained although there are indications that
catches have decreased in 1998.   This indicates that

Vancouver I s land.
the distribution of sardines may have shifted nort h -
ward in 1997 and 1998. Sardines moved into the
Strait of Georgia late in 1998.  Additionally, large
numbers of other species (Pacific hake and Pacific
mackeral) have moved into the Canadian zone in
larger numbers and are also moving farther north
each year (Figure 6) and spawning.
Another change in behaviour was the documented
spawning of sardines off the west coast of Vanco u -
ver Island (Figure 7).  Sardines in spawning cond i -
tion were sampled off southern Vancouver Island in
July 1997, and large numbers of young of the year
were captured in the same area in February, March
and April of 1998. In February 1998, 31 sets were
made in the top 30 m off the west coast of Vanco u -
ver Island. The catches of sardines from the 1997 year class were twice that of catches of the 1997
year class of herring ( Clupea harengus ) in the same
sets indicating that these juvenile sardines were a
common component of the fish community in the
surface waters off Vancouver Island. The young fish
have remained off the coast and have been captured
throughout British Columbia waters including the
Strait of Georgia, northern Hecate Strait and Alaska.
Sardines remained abundant and spawned off the
west coast of Vancouver Island in 1998 even though
El Niño conditions did not persist. Two prior i n -
stances of sardine spawning near the British Colu m -
bia coast have been recorded (Williamson, PBS u n -
published report, 1929; Hart, 1943).  In both
instances, 1929 and 1939, the authors reported one-
year-old sardines in the catch, but the presence of
young-of-the-year sardines was always considered
to be rare.

Sardines were feeding mainly on phytoplankton
(diatoms) and zooplankton (copepods and eupha u -
siids) (Figure 8).  In 1997, all fish examined (140)
were feeding.  In 1998, about 28% had empty sto m -

couver Island.
Conclusions
Sardines have increased in abundance in waters
off British Columbia and are a dominant species in
the surface waters.  The unexpected large abundance
of sardines has changed our thinking with respect to
the cause of the collapse of sardines in the 1940s.
The traditional explanation of overfishing as the
principal cause for the collapse needs to be ree x -
amined as it is clear that ocean conditions affected
both distribution and survival. Also, it is illogical
that overfishing would eliminate every single fish
for over 40 years. The spawning of sardines in 1997
and 1998 also represents a change in their behavior.
This change may be related to El Niño, but is also
likely to be related to other changes in the ecosy s -
tem, as the El Niño events in the 1950s through to
the 1980s were not associated with sardine mov e -
ment and biology. It is worth remembering that the
California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investig a -
tions ( CalCOFI) studies were initiated in an attempt
to explain the collapse of the sardine stocks in the
late 1940s.  A lot of information has been collected
about the ocean ecosystem since, but we still do not
understand the mechanisms that are responsible for
the fluctuations in sardine abundance.  We propose
that, in order to understand how to manage sardine
stocks, we must understand how they are regulated
naturally. These animals are an excellent indicator
of ecosystem change. This means that the popul a -
tion dynamics of other species, such as coho ( O n -
corhynchus kisutch ) and chinook ( O. tshawytscha )
salmon could also change for natural reasons. We
believe that the changes we have seen in sardine
distribution, abundance and spawning (and the same
changes in other fish) indicates a major shift in the
dynamics of the ecosystem that occurred in waters
off British Columbia in the early 1990s.  A key to
understanding why large fluctuations in sardine
abundance occur may be by understanding why they
have shifted their range northward.  Thus it may be
as important to study the impact of the upcoming La
Niña on sardines as it was to study the impact of the
1997 El Niño.

To a large extent, seabirds are constrained to sp e -
cific parts of the ocean on the basis of the chara c -
teristics of the marine climate. Large water masses
or groups of similar, adjacent water masses often
have characteristic assemblages of seabirds. Large-
scale events that alter marine climates should pr o -
duce changes in the seabird community characteri s -
tics that are consistent with the water mass alter a -
tions. However, because the factors that constrain
seabirds to particular water masses are poorly u n -
derstood, it is difficult to predict their response to
large-scale perturbations.
Wahl et al. (1993) noted that during the 1982/83
El Niño, Fork-tailed Storm-Petrels Oceanodroma
furcata were observed to feed atypically on the la r -
vae of Dungeness crab Cancer magister in coastal
Washington.  During that same summer, widespread
abandonment and failure of Brandt’s Phalacrocorax
pencillatus and Pelagic P. pelagicus cormorants
occurred in Oregon ( Graybill and Hodder, 1985). It
was assumed that the elevated surface water te m -
peratures had affected the distribution and recrui t -
ment of prey fish, which in turn had impacted the
feeding (and reproductive) ability of these species.
Off California, Briggs et al. (1987) observed ( during
1982/83) lower overall at-sea seabird densities;
higher relative percentages of warm-water species;
and reduced numbers and southward dispersal of
northern nesting species. Common Murres Uria
aalge were 60% less numerous at sea during the
1982/83 winter and they foraged unusually far from
land. In marked contrast, off Washington passage
migrants and resident species fed nearer to the coast
during that same event. Wahl et al. (1993) suggested
that detritus-based estuarine systems (such as off
Washington), were less affected by El Niño events
than upwelling systems (off Cal i fornia).
In an effort to better understand the impacts of
large-scale variations in oceanographic conditions
on seabirds off the British Columbia coast, I began
monitoring seabirds along a repeated 1500-km
cruise track (Line P) to Ocean Station Papa (50   N
by 145   W) in May 1996.  To date, six surveys have
been completed (May and August ’96, February and
June ’97, and February and June ’98). Surveys were
conducted only while the ship was steaming at more
than 5 knots (9.25 km h
–1 ) during daylight hours.
During the surveys, the sea and sky were contin u -
ously scanned in a 180   field centred on the ship’s
bow. Transects were a running series of 5-min
counts; the start and end position and time of each
transect series were noted. Within each 5-min count
period, all birds seen within 250 m of the ship were
identified and tallied.  N umbers of birds observed in
each transect were transformed into densities
(no./km
2 ) by species and by total birds. Mean dens i -
ties were calculated for five segments of the route
(Table 1), as well as for the entire survey line.
It was predicted that the warming of the coastal
surface waters, the depression of the thermocline,
and the northward displacement of the Subarctic
Boundary would significantly influence the comp o -
sition, abundance and distribution of the pelagic
seabird community. Preliminary examination of the
data only partially supported this hypothesis. The
following observations suggested that 97/98 El Niño
impacted the seabird community.
• Comparing only the early summer cruises (May
’96, June ’97 and June ’98), the overall total
density of birds and the diversity of species,
were lowest in June ’97 (see Table 2). Of the
three early summer cruises, June ’97 had the
highest near-surface temperatures (Figure 1).
• Species of birds that are usually associated with
the continental shelf, such as Common Murre,
Cassin’s Auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus , and
Rhinoceros Auklet Cerorhinca monocerata
(Morgan et al. 1991) were entirely absent from
the June ’97 su r vey.
• Fork-tailed Storm-Petrels, a species that typ i -
cally is most abundant along the outer edge of
the shelf and over the slope, ranged consider a -
bly farther offshore in June ’97 (see Figure 2);
indicating that they were travelling greater di s -
tances in search of food, and were most likely
working harder to find sufficient energy for
themselves and/or for their young.

Results that tended to contradict the hypothesis
are as follows.
• Despite the continued persistence of warm near-
surface waters (to at least June ’98) the densities
of dark shearwaters (Sooty Puffinus griseus and
Short-tailed shearwaters P.  tenuirostris, Figure
3) and Leach’s Storm-petrel Oceanodroma le u -
corhoa surpassed the long-term average summer
densities (derived for pelagic waters off the BC
coast, see Table 3). The apparent “re-bounding”
of dark shearwaters suggests that the decline
was due to distributional shifts rather than due
to population declines as suggested by Veit et
al. (1996).
• In contrast to the previous year, the diversity of
species in June ’98 returned to pre-El Niño le v -
els.
• Preliminary statistical analyses failed to demo n -
strate any significant relationships between sp e -
cies densities and the water characteristics
tested (surface temperature, salinity, chlor o -
phyll- a and n i trate levels).
Speculations on the results observed :
• Over the duration of the study, changes in the
climatic/oceanographic conditions outside of the
route covered by these surveys may have altered
the normal migration routes, resulting in a d e -
pressed abundance of seabirds and an altered
species mix.
• A time lag of unknown length (12 months or
more?) may have existed between the changing
oceanographic conditions and the response of
the local seabird assemblage. Such a time lag
would likely negate simple correlation tests
between seabirds and water characteristics (that
had been measured co n currently).

Abstract
The El Niño–Southern Oscillation events for the past 22 years including the 1997–98 event have been
captured by a long time series hydrographic station in the northern Gulf of Alaska.  These events appear
as positive subsurface temperature anomalies with the 1997–98 event being nearly 3 standard deviations
above normal at 250 m.  The mechanism for this heat transport is uncertain but an enhanced California
Undercurrent or Kelvin wave propagation are likely candidates.  This connection with tropical events
could have i m plications on biological production in the Gulf of Alaska.
Background
Temperature and salinity versus depth at the
mouth of Resurrection Bay, Alaska (60   N, 149   W)
in 263 m of water have been measured since 1970
with sampling intervals ranging from hours to
months.  Since 1990, the sampling has been more
regular, approximately monthly.  The location was
originally selected for its proximity to research ve s -
sel berthing facilities in Seward for logistical re a -
sons.  However, the station is also located in the
Alaska Coastal Current, ensuring good connection
with the regional coastal circulation.
The atmospheric forcing for this site includes se a -
sonal heating, wind stress and buoyancy forcing in
the form of freshwater discharges.  The region is
dominated by the Aleutian Low in winter and has a
slight influence from the North Pacific High in
summer. Intense winter downwelling is followed by
weak summer upwelling.  The freshwater discharge
is greatest in autumn and least in early spring.  The
maximum discharge leads the maximum winds by
about 3 months, and this enables to winds to force a
coastal convergence of the low density surface w a -
ter in the winter, which should intensify the Alaska
Coastal Current at this time.
The monthly means of salinity and temperature at
standard depths have been determined (Figures 1–
3).  The monthly mean temperatures (Figure 1) from
0–50 m are minima in March increasing a maximum
at the surface of more than 13   C in August followed
by lessor maxima at depth up to 3 months later.
This seasonal temperature cycle is similar for the
upper 100 m.  Below 150 m the temperature cycle
peaks in January with amplitudes of less than 0.5   C.
The mean temperature at 250 m is slightly greater
than that at 200 m.  The monthly mean salinity
(Figure 2) and density (Figure 3) are very similar
since salinity here controls the water density.  The
minimum surface salinity is in August with the
minima at increasing depths taking place later in the
year.  The minimum salinity at 100 m is in Febr u -
ary, 6 months out of phase with the surface salinity
minimum.  The minimum vertical stratification is in
March with the maximum in August.  The minimum
surface salinity leads the maximum in runoff by
about two months.  This could be a consequence of
the autumn increase in winds, mixing the upper la y -
ers.  Such mixing is evident in the autumn te m -
perature inversions.  The salinity and density
      Figure 1.  Seasonal cycle in te m perature at GAK 1.
      Figure 2.  Seasonal cycle in salinity at GAK 1.
    Figure 3. Seasonal cycle in water de n sity at GAK 1.
variations at 150 and deeper are out of phase with
those at the surface suggesting a different mech a -
nism for their control.  The upper 100 m of this w a -
ter column appear to fluctuate on a seasonal basis
under the influence of vertical mixing.
The monthly means of temperature and salinity
are subtracted to yield anomalies of salinity and
temperature over the water depth of 263 m.  The
anomalies of salinity and temperature are coherent
with depth, suggesting that they are advected into
the region rather than being induced by local surface
evaporation, runoff, heating and cooling.
Salinity Anomalies The salinity anomaly (Figure 4) was greatest in
the early 1970s followed by a pattern of positive and
negative values.  The major periodicities of salinity
at the surface are 4 and 9 years but only about 5 and
3%, respectively, of the variance is explained by
fluctuations at these periods. ENSO is associated
with the 4-year period and the 9-year periodicity of
the surface salinity is consistent with decadal a t -
mospheric variations found in the Arctic.  Near
bottom at 250 m, the 4-year period accounts for
more than 8% of the variance while the fluctuations
at 14–15 years can explain more than 10%. Coastal
freshwater discharge is a potential driving force and
has dominate periodicities of 4 and 16 years, but
this can only explain 2 and 3% of the variability,
respectively.  The relatively small amount of sali n -
ity variance explained by ENSO suggests that it is
not a major factor in interannual salinity variability
at any depth.  The relatively coherent salinity ano m -
aly signal with depth suggests that the horizontal
advection of these anomalies is important rather
than local surface forcing by atmospheric pro c esses.
Temperature Anomalies
The temperature anomalies (Figure 5) were below
normal in the early 1970s, increasing to above no r -
mal in 1977–98.  The 1980s brought anomalies with
broad temporal scales while shorter duration events
were found in the 1990s, punctuated by the 1997
upper layer warming, then a mid-depth and deep
warming in 1998.  The dominate periods of the su r -
face temperature anomalies are 5 (<3%) and 9 (3%)
years with the majority of the variance contained in
the interdecadal periods.  In the lower layers (150–
200 m) a 5-year period  (10%) fluctuation is acco m -
panied by interdecadal fluctuations with a period of
19–20 years that accounts for about 30% of the
variance. Thus, the temperature and salinity anom a -
lies differ in their dominate time scales.  Using an
increase of one standard deviation as an indicator of
ENSO (Figure 6) all prior ENSO events (1977,
1982–93, 1987, 1992–93 and 1997–98) can be seen
in the 250-m temperature anomaly record with the
exception of the 1972 ENSO that did not propagate
to high latitudes.  The 1997–98 event has produced
an anomaly that exceeds 3 standard deviations.  It
reached its maximum in February 1998 and was
back below the ENSO threshold by May.  It must be
noted that in comparing these measurements with
prior ENSO events, since September 1990, sa m -
pling has been approximately monthly rather than
irregularly as was the case with the “ship of oppo r -
tunity” sampling.  It is uncertain as to whether the
ENSO signal propagates only in the subsurface la y -
ers only or whether it propagates throughout the
water column but is masked by other forcing in the
upper layers.
What are the possible causes for this ENSO si g -
nal?  The lack of a salinity signal with this te m -
perature elevation suggests that the baroclinic flow
in the region is not altered.  However, a barotropic
forcing such as the change in the California and
Alaska Currents could bring warmer water into the
region.  The alongshore gradient of bottom te m -
perature at 250 m is uncertain but might be about
half that in the surface layers that is about 1   C/ 200
km.  A poleward excursion of about 600 km would
cause the observed temperature elevation of about
1.4   C.  Since the salinity gradients are parallel to the
coast, there would be no salinity change.  To a c -
complish this shift, there would have to be an i n -
crease in the coastal current of about 8 cm/s over 3
months.  In either case, the ENSO signal is supe r -
imposed on a decadal deep temperature signal and
its effect on biological productivity depends on both
the amplitudes and phases of these c y cles.

and the suite of parameters will be expanded to i n -
clude nutrients as part of the Northeast Pacific

Abstract
We have been conducting detailed studies of the biology of seabirds in relation to oceanography and fo r -
age fish ecology in lower Cook Inlet, Alaska, since 1995. This fortuitously allowed us to document bi o -
logical effects of the 1997/98 ENSO in this region. Anomalously warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs)
were observed in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) beginning in June of 1997, but not in Cook Inlet until Se p -
tember, 1997. Warm temperature anomalies at the surface and at depth persisted until May of 1998, when
temperatures returned to average in the GOA and Cook Inlet. Thus, temperature anomalies occurred ou t -
side the core window of productivity (June–August) for forage fish and seabirds in both 1997 and 1998.
Abundance or production of phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish, and seabirds in lower Cook Inlet varied
among years, and overall appeared to be depressed in 1998.  We observed a few biological anomalies that
might be attributed to ENSO effects: (1) a significant die-off of Common Murres occurred in March–May
of 1998, (2) murres and Black-legged Kittiwakes were physiologically stressed during the 1998 breeding
season, (3) murres failed to reproduce at one colony in 1998, (4) kittiwake breeding success was lower
than usual at colonies in 1998, and (5) phenology of breeding was later in 1998 for both murres and kitt i -
wakes .  We presume that seabird die- offs, reduced productivity and delayed phenology were linked to a
reduction or delay in food availability, but the mechanism by which anomalously warm water temper a -
tures in winter reduce forage fish availability during the summer breeding season for seabirds is not
known.
Oceanography
The 1997/98 ENSO was well developed at the
equator by July of 1997.  Anomalously warm sea
surface temperatures (SSTs) developed rapidly
during June in the GOA and Bering Sea, presum a -
bly via atmospheric tele-connection with the tropics.
SST positive anomalies of 2   C in the GOA persisted
throughout summer of 1997 (Figure 1), diminished
to ~1   C in October ; and persisted until May/June of
1998.  Water temperatures at depth (0–250 m) di f -
fered markedly from surface temperatures during
summer of 1997. Warming of deeper waters started
much later (September) and peaked in Febr u -
ary/March of 1998. In lower Cook Inlet, effects of
the 1997/98 ENSO were ameliorated by upwelling
and tidal mixing at the entrance to Cook Inlet.
Whereas the northern GOA was well stratified du r -
ing summer of 1997 and capped by warm surface
layers, strong upwelling occurs around the Kodiak
Archipelago and at the entrance to Cook Inlet,
leading to complete mixing of the water column and
reduced surface temperatures in these areas (Figure
2). Cold, mixed waters are carried north by prevai l -
ing currents far into Cook Inlet. Strong tidal mixing
limits stratification to protected areas such as
Kachemak Bay where river outflows create shallow
lenses of warm, low-salinity water at the surface. On
the west side of Cook Inlet, currents flow south and

waters are weakly stratified, warmer and less saline.
Although they differ slightly in absolute temper a -
ture, SSTs from Kachemak Bay, Chisik (on the west
side, Figure 2) and the Barren Islands (entrance to
Cook Inlet) show similar seasonal and annual SST
trends. As a consequence of this oceanographic r e -
gime, SSTs in Kachemak Bay (Figure 3) do not r e -
flect SSTs in the outer GOA; instead they reflect
temperature fluctuations of the entire GOA water
column (Figure 1). SSTs in Kachemak Bay and the
GOA during 1996 were about average most of the
year. The large SST anomaly observed in the GOA
during June–August of 1997 (Figure 1) was not o b -
served in Kachemak Bay (Figure 3) or at Chisik and
Barren islands. SSTs in Kachemak Bay began to
increase in August 1997 and were 1–2   C higher
than average throughout fall and winter ; returning to
average in May of 1998. As for GOA temperatures
at 0– 250 m depth, SSTs in Kachemak diverged most
from average values during February and March of
1998 (Figure 3).
Biological E f fects
Plankton
We began monitoring phytoplankton and zo o -
plankton abundance in 1997. Phytoplankton co n -
centrations were measured using a CTD with a t -
tached fluorometer. Zooplankton were collected
seasonally at a single station in Kachemak Bay, and
we measured settled volumes to estimate abundance
(Figure 4). Primary and secondary production in
Kachemak Bay varied among and between seasons,
but with only two years of data we can only co n -
clude that there was no indication of any dramatic
ENSO effects (e.g., total production failure) in e i -
ther year. However, maximum zooplankton volumes
in 1998 were about a third of those observed in
1997. Fish
Fish were sampled in both Kachemak Bay and
around Chisik Island using a modified herring mid-
water trawl (July) and beach seines (June–Aug.),
and in Kachemak Bay using a small bottom trawl
(Aug.). The same gear and methods were used in all
years of study.  We targeted small forage fishes co n -
sumed by seabirds. More than 300,000 fish co m -
prising over 60 species have been caught on these
surveys. Dominant taxa include juvenile pollock,
sand lance, osmerids, and herring. In general, fish

catches are much higher in Kachemak Bay (Figure
5a) than around Chisik Island (Figure 5b) owing to
regional differences in productivity. Catches of fo r -
age fish increased in Kachemak Bay, but decreased
around Chisik Island, between 1997 and 1998.
Catches in both areas in 1997/98 were higher or
similar to those observed in 1996. However, trawl
catches are highly variable and biased because we
conduct trawls only where hydroacoustic signals
indicate the presence of fish. Analyses of h y -
droacoustic data (in prep.) suggest that biomass of
fish was reduced in most areas of Cook Inlet in
1998. Beach seines suggest that fish were delayed in
arriving nea r shore in 1998.
Seabird Producti v ity
Here we consider two species (Common Murres
and Black-legged Kittiwakes) from colonies at Ch i -
sik Island and Gull Island. Murres maintained rel a -
tively high productivity among all years of study at
Gull Island in Kachemak Bay (Figure 6). Diets were
similar among years, and analyses of time budgets
(foraging trip duration, “loafing time”) suggest that
murres had no difficulty finding food in 1997 or
1998. At Chisik Island, however, murres exper i -
enced a complete breeding failure in 1998 (Figure
6). They started breeding later than usual (Figure 7),
displayed erratic attendance, and had significantly
higher levels of stress hormones in their blood
plasma in 1998 than in 1997 (Figure 8). Complete
breeding failure is rare in murres because they can
compensate for wide fluctuations in food supply by

adjusting their time budgets – which is why they
usually manage to produce chicks at Chisik despite
poor food supplies. We therefore view the delayed
phenology and subsequent breeding failure of mu r -
res at Chisik in 1998 as particularly signif i cant.
In contrast, kittiwake breeding success is typ i -
cally more variable and sensitive to fluctuations in
food supply. In Kachemak Bay, kittiwake breeding
success was much reduced in 1998 compared to
1996/1997 – but fell within range of variability o b -
served in previous years of study (Figure 9a). Ho w -
ever, notable low production events in the past also
correspond to years with moderate ENSO warming
of winter water temperatures in Alaska (1987, 1993,
1994). Low production in 1998 was largely due to
low laying and hatching success, which was about 3
weeks later than usual (Figure 10). Once hatched,
chick survival was high. At Chisik Island, kitt i -
wakes have always done poorly in recent years
(Figure 9b). Evidence suggests this is because of
generally poor food supplies around Chisik and b e -
cause, in contrast to murres, kittiwakes cannot a d -
just their time budgets to deal with fluctuations in
food supply, nor can they range as far to find food.
The 1998 breeding season at Chisik was notable
because birds failed much earlier than usual (during
incubation), phenology of egg laying was about 2–3
weeks later than usual, and adults produced abs o -
lutely zero chicks.

Seabird die- offs
A large and extensive seabird die-off was o b -
served in Alaska during summer 1997; largely co n -
fined to the southern Bering Sea and Aleutians. Su r -
face-feeding species such as shearwaters (and much
lesser numbers of kittiwakes) died en masse from
apparent starvation. Some hundreds of thousands of
birds were probably affected, and peak mortality
occurred in August when SST anomalies were hig h -
est. Smaller die- offs of murres were also reported
from the northern Bering Sea, mostly in May and
June. Although SST anomalies were also high in the
GOA during the summer of 1997, no die- offs were
reported there. In 1998, however, a moderate die-off
of Common Murres was observed in the northern
GOA. Dead murres were reported over a wide area
(Figure 11) from about March through May, with
peak mortality occurring in mid-April. This fo l -
lowed a long period of anomalously warm water
temperatures in the GOA (Figure 1). Most murres
were apparently subadult (non-breeders) and died of
starvation. A preliminary tally indicates that at least
1300 dead murres were observed on beaches in the
GOA. Previous studies indicate this would be a
small fraction of the total mortality, which probably
numbered in the tens of thousands. The most recent
large seabird die-off observed in the GOA occurred
during late winter of 1993 following a prolonged
period of anomalously warm SSTs associated with
the 1992/93 ENSO. In that die-off, about 120,000
murres died from starv a tion in the northern GOA.

The 1997–98 EL Niño in the Bering Sea as Compared with Previous ENSO
Events and the “Regime Shift” of the Late 1970’s

The Bering Sea undergoes exceptional seasonal
as well as extreme interannual variability.  In the
mean, winter sea ice advance exceeds 1000 km
while in summer the Bering Sea is ice free.  Ho w -
ever, interannual ice variability is as great as 400
km.
The interannual variability of the Bering Sea d e -
pends in large part on the winter variability of the
Aleutian low.  Results of analyses (e.g., Niebauer,
1988) of the Aleutian low, monthly mean ice cover
from the Bering Sea, and the Southern Oscillation
Index (SOI), show that before a regime shift in the
late 1970s, below normal ice cover in the Bering
Sea was typically associated with El Niño.  That is,
El Niño conditions caused the Aleutian low to move
eastward of normal carrying warm Pacific air from
the south over the Bering Sea.  Sea and air te m -
peratures were above normal under winds from the
south or less strongly from the north.  Conversely, above normal ice cover was associated with La Niña
conditions which caused the Aleutian low to move
westward of normal allowing higher pressure to
move over the Bering Sea.  Sea and air temperatures
were below normal under stronger winds from the
north.
In the late 1970’s, a “regime shift” or “step” o c -
curred in the climate of the north Pacific causing,
among many other effects, a 5% reduction in the ice
cover in the eastern Bering Sea (Figure 1) as well as
shifts in the position of the Aleutian low.  The ove r -
all reduction in ice cover can be traced to an overall
increase in El Niño conditions which has resulted in
an increase in the influence of the Aleutian low over
the eastern Bering Sea ( Niebauer, 1998).  However,
during El Niños since the regime shift, the Aleutian
low has been moving even farther to the east cau s -
ing winds to blowfrom the east and north off Alaska
instead  of  from  the south.  This has caused ice
advance during El Niños (as during this last El Niño
of 1997–98) whereas before the regime shift, the ice
retreated during El Niño ( Niebauer, 1998).
This shift in the organization of ENSO (El Niño–
Southern Oscillation) events has had a strong effect
on the statistical correlation between the Southern
Oscillation Index and Bering Sea ice cover.  This
Aleutian low movement has caused the correlation
Figure 1.  Winter averaged (NDJFM) percent ice
cover anomalies for the Bering–Chukchi Seas for
the period 1954–98.  Average anomalies for the
periods 1954–77 and 1977–98 are also shown.
The difference in the means is statistically signif i -
cant at the 0.005 level.  For comparison, standard
deviations of ~6.6% and ~4.8% were obtained for
the 44-year long monthly mean and winter mean
sea ice anomalies time series respectively (After
Niebauer, 1998).
of ice with the SOI to change sign compared to b e -
fore the “regime shift” ( Niebauer, 1998).  For the
period 1953–78 (i.e., before the regime shift), the
correlation coefficient was positive (less ice during
and following El Niño, and more ice during and
following La Niña) with ice lagging the SOI by ~7
months (Figure 2).
In strong contrast, after the regime shift, for the
period 1978–95, the correlation coefficient changes
sign (Figure 2).  The change in sign of the correl a -
tion means that since the regime shift, decreases in
ice are now associated with El Niño events.  An i m -
portant point (as outlined above) is that this is co n -
sistent with El Niño-associated Aleutian lows b e -
coming even more intense and moving even farther
east following the regime shift.  These more easterly
Aleutian low pressure patterns are forcing winds
northward off the Pacific into interior Yukon/Alaska
where the winds turn westward carrying continental
air out over the Bering Sea.  Before the regime shift,
during El Niño, the Aleutian low was not so far east
so that the northward winds carried warm north P a -
cific air over the Bering Sea.
In considering the specific example of this latest
El Niño of 1997–98, in the mean, during the winter
the Aleutian low was more intense and eastward of
normal in teleconnection with the Southern Oscill a -
tion.  However, in November and again in March,
the Aleutian low was directly over the Bering Sea
causing strong below normal ice conditions in N o -
vember and slightly below normal ice conditions in
March and April (Figure 3).  But in December,
January and February, the Aleutian low moved so
far to the east that winds over the Bering Sea were
from the northeast resulting in above normal ice
conditions as well as colder than normal air and sea
temperatures under abnormally cool winds (Figure
3).
This relationship between SOI and ice provides
the possibility of predicting ice conditions because
of this long duration lag of statistically significant
correlation (Figure 2), and because of (or perhaps in
spite of) the change in sign of correlation between
ice and SOI through the climate shift.
Before the regime shift, the occurrence of El Niño
and La Niña conditions was about even.  Since the
regime shift, El Niño conditions are about 3 times
more prevalent ( Niebauer, 1998).  The result is a
general warming of the Bering Sea associated with
the 5% decrease in ice cover. There is evidence
( Mantua et al., 1997; Minobe, 1997) that this regime

back to at least the late 1800’s, and may be due to a

ENSO events are probably not the only pheno m -
ena causing interannual variability in the Bering
Sea.  In addition to ENSO events, the atmospheric
circulation over the North Pacific is probably also
sensitive to local SST anomalies. In some winters,
the atmospheric teleconnection mode called the P a -
cific-North American pattern (PNA), and/or the
Western Pacific oscillation (WPO or WP), a north–
south dipole over the western north Pacific, are
prominent, with substantial effects on the Aleutian
low. Acknowledgements This research was sponsored by

Oceanographic conditions, mainly temperature
fields, in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas in 1997/98
are compared with those in previous, non-El Niño years (1995–1996). The study is based on monthly
sea surface temperature (SST) maps constructed at
the Russian Federal Research Institute of Fishery
and Oceanography (VNIRO) as part of the program
on the use of satellite and ship data to monitor the
dynamics of SST in various fishing areas of the
world ocean. The main purpose of the program is to
provide the Russian fishery community with oper a -
tive and monthly information on the state of env i -
ronment in regions where the Russian fleet operates.
Also, data of several oceanographic surveys co n -
ducted in the western Bering Sea in 1995–1997 are
used. Figure 1 demonstrates the variability in mean
monthly SST anomalies in the Northwest Pacific for
1997. As is seen, the El Niño signal appeared in April,
1997 and reached it maximum in October, when
positive SST anomalies in the central Sea of O k -
hotsk and northwestern Bering Sea exceeded 3   C.
Figure 2 shows differences in mean winter (left
panel) and mean summer (right panel) SST and sea
level pressure (SLP) values between 1996 and 1995,
1997 and 1996, 1998 and 1997.
The maps allow one to identify some features of
climatic variability in the region for 1996–1998.
The warming started in winter, 1996 and was o b -
served on most of the investigated region. The only
exception was the area off Kamchatka, at the nort h -
wes t ern part of the Bering Sea, and the eastern
Figure 1.  Variability of SST anomalies in the Northwest Pacific during 1997 (by satellite data).
Sea of Okhotsk . In 1997 warming was observed in
the whole Northwest Pacific, including the Bering
and Okhotsk Seas. Positive differences between
1996 and 1997 exceeded 1.0–1.5   C. Quite the opp o -
site situation was noted between the cold seasons of
1998 and 1997. In fact, SST decreased over the
whole Northwest Pacific (about 1–2   C), and ice
cover area increased.
These changes in SST patterns corresponded to
changes in the character of the atmospheric circul a -
tion. Thus, if in 1996 the northwestern Bering Sea
was affected by the northeastern periphery of the
Siberian High with a prevalence of the northern
winds and corresponding decrease in SST, in 1997
this part of the sea was under influence of the eas t -
ern periphery of a large cyclonic formation with
predominately southern winds. In 1998 the atmo s -
pheric situation was very similar to that of 1996
(Figure 2, left panel).
The development of atmospheric and oceanic
processes in the summer seasons of 1996–1998 was
somewhat different from that in winter (Figure 2,
right panel). The clear lessening of the East Ka m -
chatka Current was observed in 1996. Compared
with 1995, 1996 showed positive SST differences of
1–2   C in its core. The same situation was observed
in summer, 1997. Differences in mean summer SST
between 1997 and 1996 in the western Bering Sea
exceeded 3   C. However, cooling that started in the
Northwest Pacific in 1998 was more pronounced in
summer than in winter. A decrease in SST in
Anadyr Bay and off Navarin Cape in the Bering Sea
exceeded 3   C
Changes in ice conditions during 1996–1998 were
also considered which allowed one to identify some
anomalous events occurring in the Bering and O k -
hotsk Seas during the El Niño in 1997 (Figures 3
and 4).

tudes and (b) numbers of 1° · 1° squares covered by ice on April 1 and May 1 and their differences for
1995–1998.
For example, in 1997 the northern boundary of
the so called “eastern channel” ( aquatory perm a -
nently free of ice during the cold season in the eas t -
ern Sea of Okhotsk) did not cross 57   N, while in
1998 the boundary was located south of this latitude
for 80 days (Figure 3a). The rate of decreasing ice
area in the sea was highest in 1997–1998 compared
with 1995–1996, as is demonstrated by differences
in the number of 1   · 1   squares covered by ice
between April 1 and May 1 (Figure 3b).
Duration of the ice period around St. Matthew
Island in the Bering Sea decreased beginning in
1996, and in 1998 it equaled 48 days compared with
138 days in 1996 (Figure 4a). 1997 was also cha r -
acterized by the early retreat of the ice boundary to
the north of 63   N in both the western and eastern
Bering Sea. If, in 1996, ice boundary crossed the
western Bering Sea at 63   N in mid-June, in 1998
this occurred in the third ten-day period of April
(Figure 4b). Thus, the difference was about 55 days.
Also, in the western region of the sea a decrease in
the ice cover area in 1997 started on February 17,
while in 1996 it began on April 15, and in 1998, on
March 15 (Figure 4c).
Results of joint Russian–Japanese surveys co n -
ducted in June and September, 1997 onboard of
Japanese trawler Tenyo Maru 78 in the northwestern
Bering Sea showed some significant anomalies in
the development of oceanographic conditions. First,
the core of Warm Intermediate Layer (WIL), in both
June and September, was located at depths of 320–
370 m which was by 30–100 m shallower than that
found from Arsenyev’s data (1967) and by 50–100
m shallower compared with values given in the atlas
prepared by Sayles et al. (1978). Along with the
rising of the core, an increase in WIL temperature
and a decrease in its salinity were observed. The
values of sea water temperature in the WIL core
along the 180   meridian were 3.80–4.00   C, while in
previous years the temperatures did not exceed
3.70–3.75   C. Salinity decreased by 0.05 psu and
greater. The mean long-term salinity in the region is
33.80 psu. In 1997 its mean values were only 33.72
psu. Such a decrease in salinity is possibly assoc i -
ated with the change in the character of WIL tran s -
formation in the Olutorsky-Navarinsky region.
Oceanographic parameters in this region are similar
to those for the Pribyloff-Matthew continental slope.
In all, positive sea water temperature anomalies in
1997 were about 1.0–1.5   C in the surface layer,
0.5–0.7   C in the core of Cold Intermediate Layer,
and 0.1–0.3   C in the Warm Intermediate Layer.
El Niño effects were apparently observed in the
western Bering Sea in 1998 as well. Despite the su r -

face thermal conditions in this region being close to
normal, temperature values in WIL remained high.
Along the continental slope off the Koryaksky coast
and Navarin area values exceeded 3.80   C. As in
1997, the location of the WIL core was exclusively
shallow, 230–280 m (cruise of R/V Professor K a -
ganovsky , August–November, 1998). In 1998 the
significant lessening of the Kamchatka Current was
also observed. There was a negative water exchange
balance via the Kamchatka Strait between the Be r -
ing Sea and North Pacific: in the 0–1000 m layer
outflow equaled 0.97 Sv, while inflow was 1.52 Sv,
and the resulting flow was –0.55 Sv. Even taking
into account the seasonal lessening of the Ka m -
chatka Current, the result is amazing.
We consider that one of the 1997/98 El Niño e f -
fects was an appearance of a typically American fish
species to the Asian coast. In 1997, rex sole ( Errex
zachirus ) which was recorded there only once ( K u -
likov, 1964) spread over almost the entire basin
(Figure 5a). Compared with previous years, large-
sized (mean length 54.8 cm) arrowtooth flounder
( Aterestes stomias ) also became a widely common
species in the western Bering Sea (Figure 5c). A c -
cording to similarity of the size composition of both
the species with that in the eastern Bering Sea, we
could assume that the warming associated with the
El Niño event led to an extension of these species
westwards.
In 1997–1998, a large record number of northern
rockfish ( Sebastes polyspinis ) (Figure 5b) and dusky
rockfish ( Sebastes ciliatus ) ( Sheiko and Tr a -
benkova, 1998) occurred in Pacific waters off the
northern Kurils; these waters also revealed juvenile
arrowtooth flounder (Figure 5d) and sablefish. Ea r -
lier, all the four species were never registered, or
were accidentally caught there. Because these sp e -
cies have pelagic larvae and juveniles, one can su p -
pose their larvae or juveniles were transported from
the Aleutian area to the North Kurils by currents in
previous years. However, they were not recorded off
the Kurils earlier. The similarity in size composition
of captured fish with those off the Aleutian Islands
may indicate their Aleutian genesis.

Introduction
The Bering Sea shelf, over 500 km wide, is sep a -
rated into three distinct biological regimes (inner,
middle and outer shelf areas) by density fronts. Its
middle shelf (located between the 50- and 100-m
isobaths) averages 30–50 g C m
–2 year
-1 
in new pr o -
duction, derived mainly from the annual spring
bloom in April and May. Two unusual events o c -
curred over the middle shelf in 1997: The first was
an intense though short-lived midsummer bloom of
mainly small diatoms; the second was the first-ever-
recorded coccolithophorid bloom. Anomalous sea
surface temperatures - possibly due to El Niño and a
relatively storm-free summer – could be the cause
of these events.
Methods
We deployed a time-series sediment trap at 35 m
depth from April 1997 through February 1998.  The
deployment site was Mooring 2 (Figure 1) on the
southeast Bering Sea middle shelf region where the
bottom depth was 70 m. The trap was outfitted with
a rotating carousel containing 12 sample tubes for
sub-sampling. Trap sub-sample intervals lasted e i -
ther one or two weeks. The number of phytoplan k -
ton in each sample was counted (Figure 2). The
d
15 N and d
13 C of each sub-sample were measured.
Also, a scanning electron microscope was used to
identify the coccolithophorid, Emiliania huxleyi
(Figure 2) . Figure 1.  Location of mooring site 2 in the southeast Bering Sea.
Figure 2.  Phytoplankton derived from the spring , summer and fall blooms over the Bering Sea middle shelf
included diatoms, flagellates and coccolithophores. (a) A silicoflagellate is surrounded by scores of 2- mm
Emiliania huxleyi coccoliths. (b) A 400- m m diatom Pleurosigma simonsenii ove r shadows a Chaetoceros spp . A high relative number of diatoms in the sediment
trap sub-samples (Figure 3) corresponds to phyt o -
plankton blooms over the middle shelf. The late
April to mid-May sub-samples represent the end of
the spring bloom, comprised mainly of large di a -
toms (50–600 mm) such as Coscinodiscus spp. and
Pleurosigma simonsenii . Our sediment trap r e -
corded an unusual mid-July bloom, which consisted
of a greater number of small diatoms (20–50 mm)
such as Odontella aurita . In Figure 3 the d
15 N of each sample reflects
bloom dynamics. The initial d
15 N value of 12.2‰
represents plankton utilizing relatively more new
NO
3 – . As the nutrient is depleted, the d
15 N of the
sub-samples increases, eventually to a maximum of
15.5‰ at nitrate depletion. Over the next two
months, fixed nitrogen is returned to the euphotic
zone through microbial breakdown of particulate
organic matter and wind mixing of the water co l -
umn. As the midsummer bloom resumes, nutrients
are quickly depleted and the d
15 N increases until
algae growth slows.
The 9/22–10/13 sub-samples contain the cocc o -
lithophorid bloom. Although the bloom was o b -
served over the middle shelf in July ( Napp et al.,
1998), the trap did not collect numerous coccoliths
until autumn. The isotopic signal during these inte r -
( b)
( a)
vals changes less dramatically. The plankton are
most likely using more new nitrogen supplied to the
euphotic zone, as mixing due to wind events i n -
creases in autumn . In Figure 4 the d
13 C tracks phytoplankton growth
rates. As diatoms grow faster they discriminate less
between the heavy isotope, 
13 C, and the lighter one
they prefer during CO
2 uptake. The d
13 C increases
as diatom biomass increases in the sub-samples and
decreases as the number of diatoms decreases.

Conclusions
During 1997, the composition of material co l -
lected by the sediment trap over the middle shelf
primarily reflected events affecting primary pr o -
ducers. These included spring and summer diatom
blooms and the late autumn sinking of the cocc o -
lithophorid bloom. The stable C and N isotopic
composition of trapped organic matter also appa r -
ently reflected phytoplankton growth rates.

The distributions of foraging whales typically r e -
flect the productivity of their pelagic and coastal
environments ( Tynan, 1998; Croll et al., 1998).
Whales can therefore serve as important integrators
of the regional biomass of their principal prey:
euphausiids, copepods and schooling fish. Redi s -
tributions of whales can also serve as important i n -
dicators of change in the ecosystem. In order to co n -
sider how the distribution of whales in the southeast
Bering Sea may have changed relative to the
anomalous oceanographic conditions of 1997 and
1998, it is first necessary to review the historical
distributions of whales relative to the mean circul a -
tion.
The general circulation consists of a cyclonic
gyre over the deep basin, with the Kamchatka Cu r -
rent forming the western boundary and the Bering
Slope Current forming the eastern boundary of the
gyre.  A 0.5 m sea-level difference between the
Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean drives the mean
northward transport through Bering Strait (Coac h -
man, 1993).  The circulation and hydrographic
structure of the Bering Sea is highly variable on i n -
terannual and decadal time scales.  Transport in the
gyre can vary by as much as 50% due to changes in
the Alaskan Stream inflow or alteration in the wind-
driven circulation ( Schumacher and Stabeno, 1998).
The Bering Slope Current is primarily an extension
of the Alaskan Stream water which enters through
the passes along the Aleutian Chain. This flow turns
eastward along the northern side of the Aleutian
Chain as the North Aleutian Slope Flow and then
continues to the northwest over the slope at mean
speeds of 3–15 cm s
–1 as the Bering Slope Current
( Schumacher and Reed, 1992).  The nutrient-rich
waters of the Bering Slope Current help to create
one of the most productive ecosystems in the world.
Approximately half of the Bering Sea consists of
the broad continental shelf, which is more than 500
km wide in the eastern portion (Coachman, 1986).
The circulation over the eastern shelf is sluggish,
with current speeds on the order of 1–5 cm s
–1 ( Schumacher and Kinder, 1983; Coachman, 1986).
Three frontal zones divide the shelf into distinct h y -
drographic domains: an Inner Front at approx i -
mately the 50 m isobath separates the Coastal D o -
main from the Middle Shelf Domain; a Middle
Front at approximately the 100 m isobath separates
the Middle and Outer Shelf Domains; and a salinity
front at the shelf-break separates the Outer Shelf and
slope domains (Coachman, 1986).
The region of the Bering Slope Current has been
called the ‘green belt’ ( Springer et al., 1996) due to
its high primary production linked to nutrient avai l -
ability.  Not surprisingly, this region also had high
historical catches of fin whales ( Nasu, 1974).  The
historical distribution of right whales ( Omura et al.,
1969) also suggests that this species tracked the
Bering Slope Current and the movement of Alaskan
Stream waters in the southeast Bering Sea. It has
been decades however since any large-scale syno p -
tic surveys of cetaceans have been conducted in the
eastern Bering Sea shelf and slope regions.
In order to quantify the modern distributions of
cetaceans in the Southeast Bering Sea, I conducted
line-transect surveys of whales from July 17 to
August 5, 1997, across the southeastern shelf from
outer Bristol Bay to 10 km west of St. Paul Island.
Survey effort covered the middle and outer shelf
domains as well as the shelf-edge and slope regions.
We completed a total of 2021 km of survey effort.
Multiplying this distance by an effective strip width
of 6 km produces a survey area of approximately
12,000 km
2 . During the summer of 1997, anomalous ocean o -
graphic conditions occurred in the Southeast Bering
Sea (Vance et al., 1998).  By mid-July, sea surface
temperatures were 2–4   C warmer than in 1996 and
an extensive coccolithophore bloom of Emiliania
huxleyi developed over the middle shelf. Our survey
found that the coccolithophore bloom was restricted
to the middle shelf domain during July and early
August. By September, when the first SeaWiFS
(Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) satellite
images of ocean color were available, the bloom
was approximately 700 km wide and extended over
most of the southeastern Bering Sea shelf.  Both the
occurrence of the bloom and the unusually warm
temperatures have the potential to alter the trophic
dynamics and prey availability in the region.
Results of this cetacean survey suggest that r e -
distributions of some species may have occurred.
Five species of large whales occurred in or near the
coccolithophore bloom: fin whale Balaenoptera
physalus , humpback whale Megaptera novaea n -
gliae , minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata , sei
whale Balaenoptera borealis, and the northern right
whale Eubalaena glacialis .  The relatively high
abundance of large whales south of the Inner Front
(50 m isobath) and near the coccolithophore bloom,
suggests that conditions on the middle shelf in 1997
provided productive foraging for cetaceans and their
principal prey: euphausiids and copepods.  This
distribution contradicts the historical pattern of
higher whale biomass associated with the “green
belt” of the shelf edge.  This redistribution is co n -
sistent with either a shift in foraging ecology linked
to anomalous oceanographic conditions during an El
Niño year, or is indicative of a longer-term change
in the regional productivity and trophic structure of
the Bering Sea ecosystem.
It is important to determine how zooplankton
production, biomass, and species composition may
have shifted in the shelf system.  The zooplankton
communities of the southeast Bering Sea shelf are
separated by distinct hydrographic domains.  The
Middle Front (100 m isobath ) is a hydrographic
boundary which also separates two major zo o -
plankton communities: an outer shelf community of
large species of calanoid copepods, such as Calanus
plumchrus , Calanus cristatus , and Eucalanus bu n -
gii ; and a zooplankton community inshore of 100 m
composed of smaller species such as Calanus ma r -
shallae , Pseudocalanus spp ., and Acartia spp . ( Cooney and Coyle , 1982; Smith and Vidal, 1986).
During 1997 and 1998, trophic dynamics may have
altered, depending on whether diatom production
became limiting and if so, whether zooplankton
could efficiently graze the coccolithophores. Some
copepods, such as Calanus , are able to feed on co c -
colithophores (Marshall and Orr, 1972). Diet studies
and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) analyses
of gut contents from zooplankton, collected from
the bloom water, may help definechanges in the tr o -
phic structure.
During July 1997, I collected two zooplankton
samples from the coccolithophore bloom on the
middle shelf ( 58 m depth). Samples were collected
with bongo nets (333 mm mesh size) in the vicinity
of right whales, a species which forages specifically
on calanoid copepods.  The species collected were
typical of the middle shelf species assemblage:
Calanus marshallae , Pseudocalanus newmani , and
Acartia longiremis .  Historically however right
whales fed on Calanus plumchrus and C. cristatus
in deeper water along the shelf break ( Nemoto,
1963).  Therefore, this population of right whales,
which is the world's most depleted population of
large whale (National Marine Fisheries Service,
1991), appears to have shifted both its foraging
ground and prey species in the Southeast Bering
Sea.  The higher densities of other species of baleen
whales on the middle shelf suggests that this region
now supports among the highest zooplankton bi o -
mass in the Southeast Bering Sea. It is important to
continue to define the effects of interannual and
longer-term climatic variability on the productivity,
structure, and function of the Bering Sea ecosystem.

Introduction
The n eon flying squid, Ommastrephes bartrami , is one of the most dominant nekton in the epipelagic
subtropical and subpolar waters of the world oceans , and it undertakes extensive seasonal north–south
migration (Seki, 1993).  In the North Pacific Ocean,
this species is composed of an autumn cohort and a
winter – spring cohort, both having a one-year life
span ( Yatsu et al., 1997).
O. bartrami has been harvested in the North P a -
cific Ocean since 1974 until the present with an i n -
tensive fishing period by the international squid
driftnet fishery during 1978 – 92, when the annual
commercial catch fluctuated between 152,505 and
356,882 metric tons (Gong et al., 1993).  The
autumn cohort is abundant in the Central North P a -
cific and was the major target of driftnet fishery
since 1979 ( Yatsu et al., 1993).
The closure of the large-scale high seas driftnet
fisheries was in effect by the end of 1992 according
to the bycatch problem .  Since 1993, fishing mo r -
tality of the autumn cohort has been derived only by
jig fishing, whose annual catch has been estimated
to be less than 10,000 tons for this cohort.
Since 1979, Hokkaido University (HU) and N a -
tional Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries
(NRIFSF) have been conducting monitoring surveys
for oceanographic and biological conditions by u s -
ing research driftnets in the western and central
North Pacific Ocean.  Yatsu and Watanabe (1996)
indicated that these monitoring data would reveal
stock abundance of O. bartrami since catch-per-
unit-effort (CPUE) of this fishery was significant ly
correlated with that of the research driftnet surveys
along 175   30´E in July , which coincided with the
peak of the commercial fishery.
The purpose of this study is to examine intera n -
nual variability in research net CPUE, size comp o -
sitions and growth of the autumn cohort until 1998
in relation to pronounced El Ni ñ o Events during
1997. Materials and Methods
1. Sea surface temperature (SST)
SST anomalies over the North Pacific Ocean
were determined on the basis of Comprehensive
Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) during
1978 – 97, which was supplied by the Japan Met e -
orological Agency as monthly means in two-degree
latitude and longitude blocks.
Interannual variability in SST around the western
feeding grounds of O. bartrami (both along
175   30´E and area of 40   – 44   N, 170   E– 180   ) and
around spawning grounds (30   – 36   N, 150   – 170   W)
was also examined from COADS and HU monito r -
ing data.

Driftnet monitoring
Monitoring operations by HU and NRIFSF have
been carried out at almost fixed sites and dates
along five transects, 155   E, 170   E, 175   30 ´ E, 180  
(HU) and 179   W (NRIFSF), from June to early
August over the Subarctic Domain, Transitional
Domain and Subtropical region. (Table 1, Figure 1).
At 155   E, monitoring was r epeated two times in
early June and from late June to early July for each
year.
The driftnets were composed of non-size-
selective nets (Takagi, 1975) and commercial nets
for squid and salmon (mesh sizes 112 – 130 mm).
Each net panel was 50 m long and 6 m deep.  A t o -
tal of 49 – 134 net panels were connected to form a
long net section and soaked over night.
CPUE is the number of animals caught per a 50 -
m net panel.  We separated catch of O. bartrami into
a autumn cohort with mantle length (ML) 30 cm and
larger, and a winter – spring cohort with less than 30
cm ML according to Yatsu et al. (1997).
3 . Size composition and age estimation
ML composition data were derived from these
monitoring surveys and from jigging surveys during
1994 – 97.  Ages of selected autumn cohort spec i -
mens obtained from 180   longitude during June,
1995 – 97, were determined with statolith micr o -
structure, following the methods of Yatsu et al.
(1997).

SST anomalies were detected in 1983, 1987, 1993,
and 1997 (Figures 2A and 3), corresponding to El
Ni ñ o years.  In the spawning ground mainly located
north of the Hawaiian Islands (30   – 36   N) in
autumn, low SSTs were also found in 1987 and
1993 (Figure 2B).

2. Distribution and CPUE
The autumn cohort was mainly distributed in the
southern area of the Subarctic Domain and in the
Transitional Domain, contrasting with the winter–
spring cohort , which occupie d subtropical waters, as
in Yatsu and Watanabe (1996) . Averaged CPUE of the autumn cohort at each 5  
longitude were generally low during 1980 – 93 and in
1997 and were high during 1994 – 96 and in 1998
(Figure 4).  Low CPUE during 1980 – 93 could be
attributed to high fishing rates derived from driftnet
fisheries.  After the moratorium of the fishery, O.
bartrami stock seemed to quickly r e cover.
Stock abundance of the autumn cohort was e x -
tremely low in 1993 and in 1997, the most prom i -
nent El Ni ñ o year in this century.  For these year-
cohorts, spawning ground SST (autumn, 1992 and
1996) were also low (Figure 2).
3 . Size compositions, age and growth
ML ranges and modes of the autumn cohort in
July indicate that squid were considerably larger in
1997, and smaller in 1996 compared to other years
(Figure 5).
The ML-age relationship (Figure 6A) indicates
that squid collected in 1997 were larger than in 1995
and 1996, yet estimated hatching months were
mostly between November and December of prev i -
ous years with slight year-to-year variation (Table
2).  ML- statolith length relationships did not seem
to depend on sampling years (Figure 6B).
On the basis of statolith daily increment width,
Yatsu et al. (1996, 1998) postulated that the most
distal part of the broader increment area (increment
width >3 mm) correspond to the end of juvenile
stage.  In the present samples, these ages were
slightly younger in 1997 (Table 3)
Statolith growth rates during the juvenile stage
seemed to be related to neither ML at capture nor
year (Figure 6C).  In contrast, statolith growth rates
seemed to decrease with ML at capture and were
slightly higher in 1997 samples (Figure 6D).  A l -
though sample sizes are very limited, this may ind i -
cate that higher somatic growth rates in the 1997
samples were derived mainly in the subadult stage.
Provisional Conclusion s
In El Ni ñ o years, summer SST around the Tra n -
sitional Domain in the central North Pacific Ocean
(40   – 44   N, 170   E – 180   ) had negative anomalies.
Extremely low stock abundance in 1993 and 1997
might have been derived fr o m negative SST
anomalies around the feeding and nursery grounds
(40   – 44   N, 170   E – 180   ).  An observed lower
CPUE in 1993 than in 1997 can be explained by a
lower abundance of spawning biomass in 1992 due
to intensive driftnet fishing.  Higher somatic growth
rates in the 1997 samples may have been achieved
during their subadult stage rather than juvenile
stage.

A New Point of View Concerning the El Niño Mechanism

It is generally believed that the lack of progress
towards successful forecasting of El Niños is b e -
cause of an incorrect interpretation of the mech a -
nisms.  On the largest scale, the ocean and atmo s -
phere interact as water is moved from east to west
by the trade winds. Wind fields are determined by
four pressure centres: the Hawaiian and Tahitian
centres are stationary anticyclones, whereas the
Asian and Australian centres are seasonal. When
there is a cyclone above Asia, there is an antic y -
clone above Australia and vice versa .  Theory su g -
gests that the water warming in the east (the El Niño
phenomenon) can arise in two ways:
1) under simultaneous abnormally weak deve l -
opment of a seasonal anticyclone and abno r -
mally strong development of a seasonal c y -
clone (the trade winds in the winter
hemisphere become substantially weaker and
the monsoons in the summer hemisphere b e -
come stronger in the Wes t ern Pacific);
2) under asynchronous seasonal alternation in
Asia and Australia that lead the development
of cyclones (trade winds do not reach the
Western Pacific; monsoons can be seen in
northern and southern hemispheres).  Opp o -
site situations will induce the La Niña ph e -
nomenon.
The strength of development and the continuation
of naturally synoptical seasons in Asia and Australia
are analyzed.  The input was daily atmospheric
pressure in Hong Kong and Darwin from 1984
through 1987.  During this period one La Niña and
one El Niño were observed. Analysis confirmed the
reliability of the theory.  Statistical testing, with a
larger database, of the stability of the discovered
connection is presented.

How Much Blame does El Niño Deserve

The rapid warming of the coastal NE Pacific in
the spring and summer of 1997 is viewed in relation
to local and remote atmospheric anomalies in the
Pacific Basin.  North Pacific climate anomalies o b -
served in 1997/98 are compared with those observed
in past warm episodes in the Northeast and tropical
Pacific, respectively.
Of particular interest is the extent to which the
tropical ENSO is reliably teleconnected to the ocean
climate of the Northeast Pacific.  This issue is a d -
dressed by tabulating atmospheric circulation
anomalies for events showing coherent and incohe r -
ent temperature anomalies between the tropical and
Northeast Pacific.

The unusual development of the last El Niño (for
the first time the event appeared in April 1997, i n -
stead of November or December as usual) was r e -
flected on natural conditions of remote regions of
the northern North Pacific Ocean.  In the present
work, observations of anomalous changes of h y -
drometeorological conditions in the northwestern
Pacific, including the far-eastern seas, are summ a -
rized:
• A significant weakening of cyclonic activity
was observed at the region 30–70   N and 130–
180   E in January– March, 1997.  The number
of cyclone-days for the Earth, counted on 5  
squares, was low (247) compared to the pr e -
vious three years (337 in 1994, 335 in 1995,
296 in 1996).  It was especially expressed for
the western part of the circulation and corr e -
sponded to a minimum solar activity (based
on data from V.F. Chistyakov, Ussuriskaya
O b servatory).
• Less ice was seen in the Sea of Okhotsk and
Bering Sea.
• The summer was unusually warm in Prim o -
rye.  Positive temperature anomalies were
registered in the north Okhotsk Sea, western
Kamchatka and in the northwestern part of
the Bering Sea.
• Data collected by TINRO-Centre specialists
show an unusual distribution of marine h y -
drobionts: the appearance of Eumicrotremus
soldativi , low abundant year-class ( Melnicov,
1997), displacement of Paralithodes camst e -
hatica to the south ( Myasoedov, 1997),
spreading of Chionocetes opilio to the north
near the cape Navarin and even in the Anadir
Bay ( Slizkin, 1997).
In January–March 1998, the meteorological
situation changed abruptly.
• The number of cyclone days increased rel a -
tively (319 in 1997). In February 1998, not
one cyclone reached the Sea of Okhotsk.
• The ice coverage for the Sea of Okhotsk
(84% for 9 March) was significantly higher
than in previous years with low ice cond i -
tions.
• The ice edge in the Bering Sea was 90–100
miles farther south than in 1997.
All the above-mentioned facts reflect indirectly
the impacts of the 1997/98 El Niño event on the N.
Pacific Ocean and its ma r ginal seas.
Predictability and Forecast Verification of El Niño Events

The 1997/98 El Niño prediction and natural di s -
asters over the coastal areas for China (the strongest
storm surge in this century, the lighter than normal
sea ice cover in the Bohai Sea, and so on) are r e -
viewed. In fact, the prediction of El Niño has i m -
proved world wide.  The 1997/98 El Niño prediction
of the National Research Center for Marine Env i -
ronment Forecasts was very successful.
Methods to make the El Niño prediction more r e -
liable are discussed. A method of forecast verific a -
tion was developed.  For each test parameter, the
following factors were tabulated: average deviation,
mean absolute error, tendency correlation, anomaly
correlation, absolute correlation, skill index, and
ability index.  The most successful El Niño predi c -
tions (correlation coefficients were 0.5–0.7 with six
or more months lead) were those using statistical–
dynamic methods, but they still exhibited the spring
predictability barrier in February to April.
The primary objective of El Niño prediction is to
improve the ability to predict sea surface temper a -
ture anomalies (SSTA).  The analyses indicate that
the correlation of SST between two or three co n -
tinuous months is strong, and it shows that the r e -
gions with the strongest SST persistence are co n -
centrated in specific areas.  This demands more
attention. It is possible that operational El Niño predictions
in the next few years should continue to be based on
the statistical–dynamic methods rather than on the
dynamic models.
