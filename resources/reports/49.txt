Executive Summary 
 
Marine biodiversity is important for maintaining ecosystem structure and function which, in turn, supports 
sustainable fisheries. Understanding the drivers of biodiversity change (e.g., non-indigenous marine species, 
climate change, eutrophication, fishing, pollution, etc.) and their interactions can help to inform policy makers 
and managers on decisions related to ecosystem-based management that balance multiple objectives. PICES 
has no formal mechanism to exchange information or to provide advice on issues related to biodiversity in the 
North Pacific despite recent requests to do so, for example, from the Convention on Biological Diversity 
(CBD). At the same time, other intergovernmental organizations have recognized the need to advance research 
focused on biodiversity. These include the Strategic Initiative on Biodiversity (SIBAS) within the International 
Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) and the Medium-Term Strategy within the Northwest Pacific 
Action Plan (NOWPAP). In addition, the North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC), which includes all 
PICES member countries, recently brought into force a new convention on marine conservation. This 
convention requires member countries to study, conserve and manage vulnerable components of marine 
biodiversity in international waters of the North Pacific Ocean. Thus, PICES, as a science organization, is well 
positioned to participate in facilitating the collaborative science needed to address biodiversity priorities in the 
North Pacific Ocean and to partner with other international organizations, such as ICES, NOWPAP, NPFC, 
CBD, and FAO. 
 
At PICES-2013 the Study Group on Biodiversity Conservation (SG-BC) was approved, and formally 
established in January 2014.  The following month, SG-BC members began proposing ideas related to the 
Group’s terms of reference to lay the foundation for the structure and content of this report. A list of drivers of 
biodiversity change in the North Pacific Ocean identified by each PICES member country was reviewed by 
SG-BC. A list of key knowledge gaps that were regarded as priorities in each member country was compiled, 
as well as research questions relevant to PICES, which were grouped into five themes: 
• Baseline inventories of biodiversity, including species and habitats;  
• Analyses to understand and predict spatial patterns in species or habitat distributions;  
• Monitoring to understand drivers of temporal trends in biodiversity;  
• Vulnerability assessment of species and habitats;  
• Analytical methods for marine spatial planning and ecosystem-based management.  
 
Realizing that the breadth of identified knowledge gaps and research priorities would not be feasible to address 
with the timeframe of a single expert group, SG-BC devised a list of criteria by which to evaluate the merits of 
potential research avenues.  Three ideas were proposed and evaluated against these criteria:  
• Develop a plankton/nekton biodiversity network;  
• Develop technical guidance on how to monitory biodiversity;  
• Study the diversity and distribution of biogenic habitat. 
The third option, researching the diversity and distribution of biogenic habitats, was favourably assessed 
against all evaluation criteria. 
 
SG-BC’s review of PICES past activities reveals that biodiversity science was recognized as a significant 
emerging issue by the Organization as early as 2000. Based on its assessment of research priorities, and past 
and present PICES activities, SG-BC recommends the establishment of a Working Group on Biodiversity and 
Biogenic Habitats, with an initial focus on coral- and sponge-dominated ecosystems.  The proposed Working 
Group will advance understanding of the distribution of coral and sponge taxa in the North Pacific Ocean and

their contribution to biogenic habitats and biodiversity.  This effort represents a new emphasis on habitat 
research for PICES, and the initial focus on biogenic habitat could provide a proof of concept on how to 
undertake biodiversity research related to other taxa/ecosystems.  Major applications of the science products 
developed by the Working Group would be provision of technical guidance on the development and 
application of species distribution models, maps of known and predicted distributions of biogenic habitats, and 
the development of biodiversity indicators.

1 Introduction 
The conservation of marine biodiversity has long 
been recognized as important, not only in terms of its 
inherent worth, but also because of the broad range 
of ecosystem services provided by diverse marine 
ecosystems (Costanza et al., 1997), including the 
provision of food, stabilization of coastal areas, and 
sequestration of carbon. During the past two decades, 
world leaders have committed to implementing 
measures to conserve biodiversity and ensure its 
sustainable use in national waters and areas beyond 
national jurisdiction. Achieving both conservation 
and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in coastal 
and oceanic ecosystems could be achieved through 
processes of systematic conservation planning (Ban 
et al., 2014) based on knowledge of the distribution 
of biodiversity and factors – both environmental and 
anthropogenic – that influence its distribution.  
 
The North Pacific Ocean is rich in biodiversity. For 
instance, to date 4,000 marine species belonging to 
52 phyla and 105 classes have been recorded from 
Peter the Great Bay, Russia, alone (Institute of 
Marine Biology, FEB RAS). As researchers survey 
ecosystems deeper and farther offshore, new species 
are discovered and described (e.g., deep-sea 
barnacles, Chan et al., 2010; glass sponges, Reiswig, 
2014). While species have been recorded to depths of 
6,000 m (Vinogradov and Shushkina, 2002), 
biodiversity is generally richest at intermediate 
depths (Smith and Brown, 2002; Kitahashi et al., 
2013). Species assemblages differ among regions 
(Zhu et al., 2011) and are often structured over large 
spatial scales (e.g., mesopelagic macrozooplankton, 
Stemmann et al., 2008) and in relation to the 
distribution of interacting trophic levels (e.g., 
Sydeman et al., 2010) or physiological constraints 
imposed by environmental conditions (e.g., sharks, 
Priede et al., 2006). While patterns in species 
richness are relatively well known, especially in 
coastal and pelagic waters, genetic and ecosystem 
diversity is less well documented (Fautin et al., 
2010).  
 
The major threats to biodiversity in temperate marine 
ecosystems include degradation of habitat, over-
exploitation, introduction and spread of invasive 
species, and climate change impacts (Dulvy et al., 
2003). In pelagic habitats, three quarters of oceanic 
sharks and rays are at risk from overfishing (Dulvy et 
al., 2008), while in coastal areas projected losses in 
seagrass habitats (Short et al., 2011) and staghorn 
corals (Richards et al., 2013) are expected to have 
significant consequences for the distribution and 
conservation of biodiversity in the North Pacific 
Ocean. Anticipated responses to climate change 
include shifts in the distributions of top predators 
(Hazen et al., 2013b) and loss of structurally 
complex coral reefs (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007). 
The marine biodiversity of plankton in the North 
Pacific Subtropical Gyre is also changing, likely in 
response to climate variation (Karl et al., 2001). 
 
Since its formation, PICES has recognized the 
importance of engaging in biodiversity research and 
has a long history of biodiversity-related contributions. 
However, the Organization has no formal mechanism 
to exchange information or provide advice on issues 
related to biodiversity in the North Pacific despite 
recent requests to do so, for example, from the 
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
1
 in 2013 
(see Appendix 4). Marine biodiversity is important 
for maintaining ecosystem structure and function 
which, in turn, supports sustainable fisheries. 
Understanding the drivers of biodiversity change 
(e.g., non-indigenous marine species, climate change, 
eutrophication, fishing, pollution, etc.) and their 
interactions can help inform policy makers and 
managers on decisions related to ecosystem-based 
management that balance multiple objectives. Other 
intergovernmental organizations have recognized the 
need to advance research focused on biodiversity. 
These include the Strategic Initiative on Biodiversity 
Science and Advice (SIBAS) within the International 
Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) and 
the Medium- Term Strategy within the Northwest

Introduction  Section 1

Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP). In addition, the 
North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC), which 
includes PICES member countries, recently brought 
into force a new convention on the conservation of 
marine resources in the North Pacific Ocean. This 
convention calls upon member countries to study, 
conserve and manage vulnerable components of 
marine biodiversity in international waters of the 
North Pacific Ocean. Thus, PICES, as a science 
organization, is well positioned to participate in 
facilitating the collaborative science needed to 
address biodiversity priorities in the North Pacific 
Ocean and to partner with other international 
organizations such as ICES, NOWPAP, NPFC, CBD, 
and FAO.  
 
The Study Group on Biodiversity Conservation (SG-
BC) was approved at PICES-2013 and established in 
January 2014. The expertise of SG-BC members 
ranges broadly from invasion biology to climate 
change, pollution, fishery–habitat interactions, 
population dynamics, marine spatial planning, risk 
assessment, ecology of biogenic species, and 
biodiversity monitoring. The terms of reference 
(TOR) for SG-BC are to: 
1. Review the scope of key drivers of biodiversity 
change in the North Pacific Ocean, including, but 
not limited to: non-indigenous marine species, 
climate change, fishing, and eutrophication; 
2. Identify potential mechanisms to advance 
biodiversity-based scientific research and/or 
conservation related to drivers of biodiversity 
change in the North Pacific Ocean; 
3. Review the research activities, past and present, 
undertaken by PICES and other international 
organizations on biodiversity in the North Pacific 
Ocean; 
4. Identify opportunities for collaboration, new 
research opportunities for PICES, and the 
potential to provide science-based advice that 
could be used to inform decisions related to the 
conservation and management of biodiversity in 
the North Pacific Ocean; 
5. Prepare a final report that includes an assessment 
of the merits of establishing an expert group 
focused on biodiversity science within PICES, 
and provide recommendations on the role(s) of 
such a group. 
 
SG-BC activities  
 
In February 2014, SG-BC began proposing ideas 
related to the five items in SG-BC’s TOR to lay the 
foundation for the structure and content of the SG 
report. Preliminary ideas and topics for biodiversity 
science were submitted by SG members from Canada, 
China, Korea, Russia, and the United States (see 
Appendix 2 for list of members). The review of 
research activities, past and present, undertaken by 
PICES and other international organizations on 
biodiversity in the North Pacific Ocean was 
completed (TOR 3). SG members prepared 
summaries of their country perspectives on: 1) the 
key drivers of biodiversity change in the North 
Pacific Ocean, 2) biodiversity research initiatives 
undertaken by their country, 3) important knowledge 
gaps, and 4) key scientific questions related to drivers 
of biodiversity change and biodiversity conservation 
that could be addressed through PICES (TOR 1).  
 
The SG-BC meeting took place on October 18, 2014 
during PICES-2014 in Yeosu, Korea (see Appendix 
3 for the business meeting report). Represented at the 
meeting were Canada (Dr. Janelle Curtis), Korea (Dr. 
Wongyu Park, Dr. Jae Hoon Noh, Dr. Charity Lee 
(observer)), the U.S. (Dr. Tom Hourigan, Dr. Chris 
Rooper), and PICES Science Board (Dr. Thomas 
Therriault (Science Board Chair)). In addition, 
written submissions were prepared by members from 
China (Dr. Jingfeng Fan) and Japan (Dr. Takeo 
Kurihara, Dr. Ryogen Nanbu) who were unable to 
attend.  
 
The 1-day meeting began with a review of SG-BC 
activities and progress to date, a review of PICES 
past and present activities related to biodiversity 
conservation, and member country perspectives on 
the key drivers of biodiversity change and important 
knowledge gaps that PICES could address. The 
afternoon was spent reviewing the list of drivers of 
biodiversity change, identifying key research 
questions that could be addressed by a new PICES 
expert group, and drafting recommendations on the 
roles that such a group could fulfill. The 
recommendations were based on a gap analysis and a 
set of evaluation criteria. Action items were 
identified for completion of the final report. 
 
  
  
Section 1  Introduction 
PICES Scientific Report No. 49  3 
Significant progress has been made on all five TOR.  
 
Completion of TOR 1.  Review the scope of key 
drivers of biodiversity change in the North  
Pacific Ocean 
 
SG-BC reviewed and drafted summaries of key 
drivers from PICES member country perspectives, as 
well as conducted a general review of published 
literature. Key drivers were grouped into six themes 
(Table 1):  
• Climate change,  
• Pollution, 
• Fishing,  
• Coastal development,  
• Non-indigenous species,  
• Ecological factors.  
 
SG-BC also noted the importance of interactions 
among multiple drivers. When compared to the 
topics addressed by past and present PICES expert 
groups, the SG noted less activity investigating 
responses to ecological factors that influence spatial 
and temporal patterns in biodiversity, and fishing 
(over-exploitation, bycatch, seafloor contact, changes 
in ecosystem structure and function).

Completion of TOR 2.  Identify potential mechanisms 
to advance biodiversity-based scientific research 
and/or conservation related to drivers of biodiversity 
change in the North Pacific Ocean 
 
SG-BC identified a broad range of mechanisms to 
advance biodiversity-based research in the North 
Pacific Ocean. These include mechanisms related to 
coordination of information management, analyses, 
and resources. 
 
Information management  
• Construction of regional databases of biodiversity, 
including indicator species and habitats. 
 
Analyses 
• Development of monitoring programs and rapid 
response plans to detect and manage changes in 
biodiversity and the distribution of non-
indigenous species; 
• Development of species distribution models for 
indicator species and biodiversity indices; 
• Development of uniform biodiversity measures 
that can be compared among ecosystems in the 
North Pacific region; 
• Identification of pathways of effects (e.g., vectors 
of non-indigenous species introductions); 
• Development of risk assessment tools; 
• Development of genetic tools to quantify 
population connectivity for key taxa;  
• Development of ecosystem models that can 
predict the effects of human activities or climate 
change on biodiversity (i.e., EcoPath, EcoSim 
models). 
 
Resources 
• Identification of planned biodiversity research 
expeditions that may benefit from international 
participation or information dissemination. 
Progress on TOR 3.  Review biodiversity activities 
of PICES and other organizations and  
TOR 4.  Opportunities for collaboration, new avenues  
of research, and provision of science advice 
 
SG-BC members compiled a list of key knowledge 
gaps that were identified as priorities from PICES 
member country perspectives, as well as research 
questions relevant to PICES. These were grouped 
into five research themes (Table 2), although some 
questions could be grouped with multiple themes. 
The five themes were:  
1. Establishment of baseline inventories of bio-
diversity, including species and habitats;  
2. Analyses to understand and predict spatial 
patterns in species or habitat distributions; 
3. Monitoring to understand drivers of temporal 
trends in biodiversity; 
4. Vulnerability assessment of species and habitats;  
5. Analytical methods for marine spatial planning 
and ecosystem-based management.  
 
The SG cross-referenced these themes with PICES 
past and present activities and concluded that most 
knowledge gaps and questions identified by SG-BC 
have not yet been quantitatively investigated by 
PICES expert groups. However, SG-BC noted that 
three expert groups (Working Group on Ecosystem-
based Management Science and its Application to 
the North Pacific (WG 19), Working Group  on Non-
indigenous Aquatic Species (WG 21), Working 
Group on  Development of Ecosystem Indicators to 
Characterize Ecosystem Responses to Multiple 
Stressors (WG 28)) have addressed biodiversity 
questions (e.g., identification of biodiversity 
indicators), and a PICES Special Publication (CoML 
Report: Marine Life in the North Pacific: The 
Known, Unknown, and Unknowable, PICES Special 
Publication 2, 2005) provides a summary of species 
diversity and richness in the North Pacific Ocean 
basin.

Introduction  Section 1 
6  PICES Scientific Report No. 49 
Progress on TOR 5.  Advice to PICES  on merits and 
roles of a biodiversity expert group 
 
There was strong support among the SG members to 
establish a PICES expert group on biodiversity. 
However, the breadth of knowledge gaps and 
research priorities identified would not be feasible to 
address within the timeframe of a single expert group. 
Therefore, the SG devised a list of criteria by which 
to evaluate the merits of potential research avenues 
where the research activity: 
• Addresses key drivers of biodiversity change; 
• Addresses knowledge gaps common to the 
majority of PICES member countries; 
• Is clearly linked to the work of existing PICES 
expert groups, but 
• Avoids duplication in effort by past and present 
PICES expert groups, and 
• Avoids duplication in effort by existing PICES 
member country initiatives; 
• Is narrowly focused to ensure efficiency and 
feasibility;  
• Is achievable with available resources; 
• Provides a model for undertaking further 
biodiversity research within PICES; 
• Provides scientific information with clear 
management application(s).  
 
In addition, SG-BC members preferred options that 
would lead to a new scientific product. Several ideas 
were discussed, and three options (Table 3) were 
evaluated against the following criteria: 
a. Establishment of a network of ocean observation 
sites for characterizing and monitoring changes 
in the distribution, abundance and diversity 
patterns of indicator species (e.g., microbial 
communities, plankton, and nekton). Patterns in 
distribution and diversity would be correlated 
with environmental variables to identify key 
drivers of change and potential predictors. It was 
noted that the Kuroshio influences the species 
distributions of five member countries (China, 
Korea, Japan, Russia and U.S.), and potential 
observation sites were proposed along the current 
as well as in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. 
  
b. Development of guidance on methods for 
monitoring changes in marine biodiversity. 
Guidance could address questions related to 
selection of indicator species, standards for data 
collection and analysis of temporal trends, advice 
on the distribution and networking of monitoring 
sites, and development of a standard ecological or 
habitat classification system. This would lay a 
framework for future PICES research related to 
assessment and monitoring of marine biodiversity 
in the North Pacific Ocean. 
  
c. Mapping known and predicted distributions of 
structure-forming species (or biogenic habitats) 
throughout the North Pacific Ocean and relating 
patterns in distribution and diversity to potential 
drivers of biodiversity change. Structure-forming 
species were viewed as important indicators of 
biodiversity and are of international conservation 
interest. This proposal was viewed as added value 
in that PICES expert groups have not previously 
focused on deepwater (i.e., >100 m depth) benthic 
habitats/ecosystems or structure-forming organisms. 
SG members also recognized the added value of 
forming a working group with technical expertise 
in methods for developing and applying predictive 
models of species distributions, habitats, and 
biodiversity. Clear scientific products were 
identified (see Appendix 3, Annual Report of the 
Study Group on Biodiversity Conservation, SG-
BC Endnote 4) and these could be readily used by 
other international organizations as inputs for 
developing management advice.  
 
There was consensus among SG-BC members to 
develop a proposal to establish a new biodiversity 
working group to focus research on option c, the 
distribution and diversity of structure-forming 
species in the deep waters of the North Pacific Ocean, 
but to recommend that PICES also consider 
undertaking options a and/or b in the future.  
Option c would also address key knowledge gaps 
identified by China in their report submitted prior to 
SG-BC’s meeting.

Preliminary feedback from the MEQ, BIO, and FIS 
committees on the proposal to establish a new 
working group on biodiversity of biogenic habitats 
 
SG-BC addressed key suggestions from MEQ, BIO, 
and FIS in revising terms of reference for a new 
working group.  
 
MEQ:  
• The working group should consider the influence 
of ocean acidification, in particular, aragonite 
saturation, on the outlook for corals in North 
Pacific Ocean; 
• A focus on the deep sea may exclude data 
contributions from some countries; 
• FUTURE has a focus on coastal ecosystems, 
through AP-AICE, but is being restructured. 
 
BIO: 
• Focus on biogenic habitats, with an emphasis on 
coral and/or sponge distribution and diversity; 
• Deepwater coral and sponge information is an 
important knowledge gap; 
• A broader focus could include other types of 
biogenic habitats (e.g., seagrass, kelp, oyster reefs); 
• Develop a yearly plan, and shorten the proposal; 
• Biodiversity indicator work has strong linkage 
with WG 28. 
 
FIS:  
• Deepwater coral and sponge information is an 
important knowledge gap; 
• Focus on deepwater biogenic habitat to narrow 
the scope; 
• Identify expert members and data sources; 
• Consider deferring until after FUTURE is 
restructured. 
 
Based on the above feedback, SG-BC revised its 
draft proposal and presented it to Science Board on 
October 24, 2014.  
 
Final report 
 
The following sections address the SG-BC’s terms of 
reference (Appendix 1) and provide additional 
recommendations on potential avenues of research 
for PICES to pursue in the short to medium term.

This section provides a list of drivers of biodiversity 
change in the North Pacific Ocean identified by each 
PICES member country, biodiversity research that has 
been undertaken or is underway by each country, and 
important knowledge gaps that could be addressed 
through collaborative research within PICES.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada 
 
In Canada, the federal department of Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada (DFO) leads scientific research 
related to the conservation and management of 
marine biodiversity and in support of Canada’s 
Species at Risk Act (SARA), the Oceans Act, and the 
Fisheries Act, among other regulatory and policy 
frameworks. Scientific research is undertaken in 
collaboration with other federal departments (e.g., 
Canadian Wildlife Service, Parks Canada Agency, 
Environment Canada), with the provinces, academic 
partners, industry, and in many instances, other nations. 
 
Key scientific research programs that currently 
address biodiversity in marine ecosystems are the 
Strategic Program for Ecosystem-based Research and 
Advice (SPERA),

 the 
National Conservation Program,

and the International Governance Strategy (IGS).

Together, these research programs address scientific 
questions related to key drivers of biodiversity 
change in Canada’s Pacific Region, including: 
• Exploitation of target species;  
• Other fishery impacts, including bycatch of 
vulnerable species, damage or mortality of 
biogenic organisms, and alteration of ecosystem 
structure and function; 
• Habitat damage, fragmentation and loss; 
• Introduction, establishment and spread of aquatic 
non-indigenous species, including the transfer of 
novel microbes/pathogens/disease to wild populations;  
• Climate change and environmental forcing; 
• Eutrophication; 
• Hypoxia; 
• Ocean acidification; 
• Protection of critical habitat for threatened and 
endangered species; 
• Implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs) 
and conservation areas; 
• Identification and management of sensitive 
benthic areas, ecologically and biologically 
significant areas (EBSAs), and vulnerable marine 
ecosystems (VMEs). 
 
Interactions and cumulative impacts of multiple 
stressors are also recognized as potentially having a 
disproportionate impact on biodiversity. 
 
Biodiversity research initiatives undertaken by Canada 
 
Research priorities that are targeted by SPERA centre 
on identifying and assessing threats to aquatic 
ecosystems, developing tools and methodologies to 
monitor and assess ecosystems, and developing tools 
for mitigating stressor impacts and implementing 
ecosystem-based management. Identification of 
threats to aquatic ecosystems is carried out through 
the development of pathways of effects models,

consideration of multiple stressors and cumulative 
impacts, and the development of risk-based 
frameworks. Research related to ecosystem 
monitoring and assessment is focused on the 
development of methods to select areas for 
monitoring ecosystems, protocols for effective 
monitoring, identification of thresholds for informing 
management decisions, identification of important 
species and habitats, identification of ecosystem 
goods and services, and analyses of tradeoffs and 
species interactions. Tools for implementing 
ecosystem-based management include of applications 
of GIS software and spatial analysis tools to classify 
seabed features and habitats, and to map biodiversity. 
Recent biodiversity-related research in the Pacific 
Region includes the development of a rapid screening 
tool for marine fish based on the Australian 
Ecological Risk Assessment Framework (ERAF), and 
the application of an ERAF for management of large 
ocean management areas and MPAs. Research 
initiatives that are currently supported through 
SPERA in Canada’s Pacific Region include research 
related to understanding the impacts of drivers of 
biodiversity change, classifying areas according to 
their ecological attributes as well as ecological and 
biological significance, developing frameworks to 
inform marine spatial planning decisions, and 
evaluating the effectiveness of conservation measures. 
Specifically, current studies in SPERA focus on: 
• Impacts of future hypoxia in British Columbia; 
• Changes in biodiversity, species distribution, 
behaviour, abundance and interactions in response 
to environmental forcing; 
• Impacts to the community structure and ecosystem 
function of the Pacific glass sponge reefs; 
• EBSAs between the shelf break and Canada’s 
boundary with the exclusive economic zone;  
• Development of a systematic hierarchical marine 
ecological classification system for use in marine 
spatial planning and MPA network design; 
• Ecosystem indicators and thresholds to inform 
marine ecosystem approach to management and 
objectives assessment in the Gwaii Haanas 
National Marine Conservation Area Reserve;  
• Effectiveness of Rockfish Conservation Areas in 
British Columbia. 
 
Two national science-based research programs focus 
strategically on the assessment, conservation and 
recovery of threatened and endangered species and 
their habitats (Species at Risk Program), and the 
assessment, monitoring and management of aquatic 
invasive species. In addition, Canada recently 
launched its National Conservation Plan which 
focuses in part on monitoring and management of 
MPAs. 
 
The current scientific research priorities for 
ACCASP centre on understanding climate change 
impacts on Canada’s oceans and inland waters, 
developing and applying tools for incorporating 
climate change considerations into management of 
aquatic ecosystems, and supporting decisions that 
have been identified as being particularly sensitive to 
the impacts of a changing climate. Sensitive 
decisions related to biodiversity include determining 
the recovery potential and critical habitat of species 
at risk and developing management measures needed 
to conserve areas within existing and future MPAs 
and MPA networks. Adaptation tools identified as 
priorities for development include science-based 
vulnerability indices for species at risk, fish habitats, 
and marine protected area networks. Current 
biodiversity research underway in the Pacific Region 
centres on developing and applying a vulnerability 
assessment framework with an emphasis on pelagic 
fishes.  
 
Canada’s IGS addresses key scientific research 
needed to support decisions in the context of 
international policies, guidelines, and commitments. 
Priorities addressed by the IGS program include 
scientific research to support decisions related to new 
regional fisheries management organizations 
(RFMOs), management of transboundary stocks, 
governance initiatives related to climate change and 
variability, implementation of ecosystem-based 
fisheries management, implementation of United 
Nations resolution 61/105 and related Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Convention on 
Biological Diversity (CBD) decisions, and 
development of new standards and tools. Key 
biodiversity agreements or guidelines addressed by 
IGS research include those advanced by the United 
Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 
61/105, FAO International Guidelines on the 
Management of Deep Sea Fisheries in the High Seas; 
CBD X/29 paragraph 48, FAO Guidelines on 
bycatch management, the World Summit on 
Sustainable Development (WSSD), and the North 
Pacific Fisheries Commission, a new RFMO that has 
recently (July 2015) implemented the Convention on 
the Conservation and Management of High Seas 
Fisheries Resources in the North Pacific Ocean.  
 
Key Drivers of Biodiversity Change  Section 2 
10  PICES Scientific Report No. 49 
Biodiversity-related research priorities identified 
through the IGS program and relevant to the Pacific 
Region centre on identification of current and 
potential impacts to areas or species vulnerable to 
ocean acidification, identification and mapping of 
VMEs and EBSAs, research in support of 
identification of significant adverse impacts, 
ecological impacts of bycatch, MPA network design, 
and understanding key processes and influences on 
biodiversity (structure, function and productivity). 
Biodiversity research currently underway in the 
Pacific Region includes development of a species 
inventory and assessment of the distribution of VME 
components and observable fisheries impacts on 
Cobb Seamount. 
  
Canada recently participated in international 
workshops led by the Convention on Biodiversity 
Secretariat and FAO to identify EBSAs (Moscow, 
Russian Federation, March 2013, and to discuss 
approaches to identify VMEs in the North Pacific 
Ocean (Tokyo, Japan, March 2014), respectively. 
 
Key knowledge gaps 
 
A review of recent requests for science advice 
submitted to DFO’s Centre for Science Advice in the 
Pacific Region provides a useful insight into 
additional important gaps in scientific knowledge 
related to biodiversity conservation. Recent requests 
related to biodiversity centred on: 
• Assessing the risks associated with the transfer of 
species, including the establishment of non-
indigenous fauna and flora, transfer of microbes, 
pathogens or disease between wild and cultured 
fish, and transfer of hatchery-derived shellfish 
among management zones;  
• Assessing impacts of fisheries and aquaculture on 
benthic communities within and outside existing 
or proposed MPAs;  
• Assessing the status of commercially exploited 
species as well as the status and recovery 
potential of threatened or endangered species;  
• Developing a strategy for monitoring responses to 
potential oil spills; 
• Mapping important species, habitats and areas, 
including listed species at risk, critical habitat for 
species at risk, and EBSAs; 
• Prioritizing areas for biodiversity conservation, 
including important areas (IAs), EBSAs, and 
commercial no-take reserves for shellfish;  
• Identifying indicators for monitoring MPAs and 
for integrated management of marine ecosystems. 
Other outstanding biodiversity questions include:  
• How does the function of special ecosystem 
features vary with their quantity, quality, and 
spatial pattern? 
• What are the effects of overfishing, including 
bycatch, on trophic structure, predator–prey 
relationships, and fish assemblages? 
• What is the value of ecological goods and 
services of MPAs, EBSAs, and ecologically 
significant species? 
• How should the principles of connectivity, 
replication and adequacy/viability be applied in 
the context of marine spatial planning and 
conservation?  
• What are the appropriate scales for conservation 
of biodiversity? 
2.2 Chinese perspective

Jingfeng Fan and Guoxiang Liao 
State Oceanic Administration 
 
Key drivers of biodiversity change in the North Pacific  
 
Against a background of declining global biodiversity, 
the situation for marine biodiversity in China is not 
optimistic. China has an extensive coastline, 18,000 
km in length, ranging from the temperate to tropical 
climate zones. China, with a distribution of most 
marine ecosystem types, is one of the countries with 
the richest marine biodiversity in the world. To date, 
China has recorded 28,000 marine species (Yu et al., 
2015), accounting for about 11% of recorded marine 
species in the world. The number of recorded marine 
species in China ranks third in the world, after 
Australia and Japan, which makes China an 
important marine biodiversity country.  
 
With the rapid development of industrial production 
in coastal cities, an increase in the intensity of fishing 
activity in the inner shelf area, and a corresponding 
rise in environmental pollution and decline of living 
resources, the high biodiversity and richness of 
marine species and living resources in the China seas 
have seriously decreased. Sustainable fishery 
production is difficult. China has fully exploited the 
living resources of its coasts and continental shelf, 
and many species of China’s coastal areas are over-
exploited. Examples are the large yellow croaker 
Larimichthys crocea, the Chinese shrimp 
Section 2  Key Drivers of Biodiversity Change 
PICES Scientific Report No. 49  11 
Fenneropenaeus chinensis, and the cuttlefish Sepiella 
japonicus, for which captures in recent years have 
decreased significantly due to population decline and 
collapse. 
 
Besides the over-exploitation of fishery resources, 
another major threat to the biodiversity of the China 
seas is environmental deterioration (pollution, coastal 
construction), particularly in the brackish waters of 
estuarine environments which are characterized by 
high productivity and provide spawning and nursery 
areas for several species.  
 
In the long term, climate change is also a major 
threat. To maintain and conserve the highly 
diversified marine biota and rich living resources of 
the China seas, the government of China has adopted 
laws and regulations for their conservation and at the 
same time has established many natural conservation 
areas (reserves) and areas or periods of time in which 
fishing is forbidden. Various research projects have 
been approved and financially supported.  
 
Changes in the biodiversity of various habitats such 
as intertidal mud flats, coral reefs, and mangrove 
swamps have been monitored and studied. An 
assessment of endangered species of major vertebrate 
groups (mammals, amphibians and reptiles, birds, 
and fishes) was published in the China Red Data 
Book of Endangered Animals in the 1990s. More 
recently, a new Red List of plant and animal species 
(terrestrial, freshwater, and marine) has been 
published, based on historical as well as new data, 
with the threatened category of species assessed 
using new IUCN (International Union for 
Conservation of Nature) criteria. Since 2004, the 
China Species Red List has documented an 
increasing number of species endangered by the 
impact of human activities (mainly over-exploitation 
and environmental pollution) and by global climate 
change. The China Species Red List is not 
encouraging, as many marine species are regarded as 
“endangered” because of over-exploitation for the 
seafood market or for “fine art” collections. 
 
To protect marine biodiversity, many countries and 
international organizations have carried out research 
and action plans for biodiversity protection at global, 
regional and national levels in recent years, including 
the Convention on Biological Diversity, International 
Biodiversity Program, Millennium Ecosystem 
Assessment, and Census of Marine Life. As a 
participating country in multiple plans, China has 
carried out a large number of ecological protection 
and construction works in the last 10 years.  
 
Biodiversity research initiatives undertaken by China 
 
A comprehensive systematic study of marine 
biodiversity in China began in the early 1950s with 
the establishment of the Qingdao Marine Biological 
Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
Since that time, scientists have carried out intensive 
multidisciplinary research on marine life in China’s 
seas and have recorded 22,629 species belonging to 
46 phyla. The marine flora and fauna of the China 
seas are characterized by high biodiversity, including 
tropical and subtropical elements of the Indo-West 
Pacific warm-water fauna in the South and East 
China seas, and temperate elements of North Pacific 
temperate fauna, mainly in the Yellow Sea. The 
southern South China Sea fauna is characterized by 
typical tropical elements paralleled with the tropical 
faunal center of the Philippine–New Guinea–
Indonesia Coral triangle. 
 
The seas surrounding mainland China and its 
southern islands and reefs span 38 degrees of latitude 
(3°–4°N) from the tropical to the warm-temperate 
climate zones, and include the widest continental 
shelf in the Eastern Hemisphere. Under the influence 
of the strong Kuroshio Warm Current, the South 
China Sea Warm Current, and the Taiwan Warm 
Current, the water temperature of the East and South 
China seas is comparatively high, warmer than 14°–
16°C in coastal areas in winter. The marine flora and 
fauna of the China seas are rich in warm-water 
species, comprising tropical and subtropical elements 
of the Indo-West Pacific Biotic Region, with high 
dominance of some endemic and economically 
important species, mainly endemic to the East China 
Sea and neighboring waters. The tropical Indo-
Malaysian biotic elements that are transported by 
these warm currents originate in the south, while the 
cold-water species come from the north and 
dominate the deeper parts of the Yellow Sea Cold 
Water Mass under the thermocline at the 15–30 m 
layer in summer. Thus, the China seas are 
characterized by high biodiversity, including 
particularly rich tropical and subtropical elements in 
the East and South China seas and temperate biota in 
the Yellow and Bohai seas. However, fewer cold-
water species are found in the Yellow Sea than in 
waters off northern Japan, which is dominated by the 
strong Oyashio Cold Current, while the number of 
tropical elements found in the South China Sea is

less than that recorded in the Philippine–New 
Guinea–Indonesia triangle area — the center of 
tropical Indo-West Pacific Biota. Low temperatures 
in winter have limited the survival of warm-water 
species, resulting in low biodiversity. Therefore, 
among a total of 22,629 Chinese marine species, only 
1,607 species live in Yellow Sea. It is noteworthy 
that the strong Tsushima Current brings some warm-
water species as it flows along the west coast of 
Honshu north to the Tsugaru Strait. Consequently, 
the number of warm-water species in the eastern Sea 
of Japan is much greater than in the western Russian 
waters, where the marine fauna is cold temperate, 
while the majority of the eastern Japanese fauna is 
warm temperate. In addition, the number of species 
in China’s seas shows a distinct increase from the 
north to the south — from high to low latitude. 
 
Important knowledge gaps 
 
Although significant advances have been made in 
marine biodiversity research in China since the 
1950s, through data collection and the formal 
description of species, much remains to be done. The 
biogeographic features and habitat of the deep sea 
and the southern China seas have not been well 
explored. Taxonomic coverage of many groups, such 
as those that comprise the meio- and microbenthos 
— nematodes, harpacticoids, and ostracod crustaceans, 
etc. — is incomplete in our present data, which 
comes largely from northern Chinese waters. The 
study of ecosystem structure and function has been 
particularly neglected in “the utmost environment” 
— the Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass — which is 
considered a refuge for North Pacific Temperate 
Fauna. Exploration and study of the bathyal and 
abyssal depths of the South China Sea, including sea 
mountains, hydrothermal vents, and cold-water seeps, 
as well as the abyssal plain and rocky trenches, 
should be strengthened. 
 
Key scientific questions related to drivers of 
biodiversity change and biodiversity conservation 
that could be addressed through PICES 
 
Key research objectives that could be addressed by 
PICES include: 
• Strengthening the collection of materials 
(specimens) for marine biodiversity study by 
carrying out a biodiversity background value 
survey and deep-sea collection cruises to discover 
new species and reveal the past and present 
abundance of major species and biological 
communities while forecasting their future. 
Intensive collections and study of deepwater 
marine biodiversity should be made to discover 
new species and to reveal past, present, and future 
trends of major species and biological 
communities; 
• Carrying out biodiversity monitoring surveys in 
various habitats to assess their present status and 
to understand the processes and mechanisms of 
global climate change and human activities that 
have an impact on biodiversity; 
• Strengthening basic research on change of marine 
biodiversity, particularly the assessment and 
conservation of biodiversity and endangered 
species for sustainable development; 
• Minimizing the disparity between the study and 
conservation of marine and terrestrial (including 
freshwater) biodiversity, and effective management. 
To achieve this, early career scientists, especially 
taxonomists, should be trained to study different 
biotic groups systematically; 
• Strengthening conservation management to 
achieve more effective management of fisheries 
resources.

Possible drivers of biodiversity change in the North 
Pacific 
 
We collected key reports and papers regarding 
marine biodiversity in the coastal area of Japan (at 
large spatio-temporal scales, mainly > 10 km and/or 
> 10 yr). They consist of four monitoring programs 
for biodiversity and eight studies on key drivers of 
biodiversity change cited below in Biodiversity 
research initiatives. The information suggests that the 
key drivers of biodiversity change include climate 
change, eutrophication, oil spills, and hypoxia. In 
addition, previous studies on biodiversity in other 
countries suggest many factors, including spatial 
heterogeneity of abiotic environments, existence of 
species pools, interspecific facilitation and 
competition, predation, and food abundance.

(i.e., increased species richness of corals in the 
northern sea area of Japan) is related with global 
warming.   
 
Okuda et al. (2009) 
Study site: Rocky shores on the Pacific coast of Japan  
Method: Record of occurrence/absence of rocky-
shore sessile animals by means of a hierarchically 
nested sampling design using fixed grids. 
Results: Latitudinal gradients of species richness, the 
pattern of which was dependent on the sampling area, 
were found. This phenomenon is discussed in 
relation to “species sorting”.  
 
Important knowledge gaps 
 
Although many researchers believe that biodiversity 
is important, this is not true for many citizens and 
politicians. To narrow the gap, researchers may need 
to clarify how biodiversity is useful (especially with 
regard to the economy). One strategy might be to 
show how biodiversity has changed in some areas of 
the sea and how the change has affected the economy 
related with those areas (e.g., fish production, 
tourism). This strategy does, however, need a large 
workforce and budget. Therefore, a more realistic 
strategy is to compare present and previous situations 
of biodiversity, using previous data, and to estimate 
the possible economic impact, if possible.

Key drivers of biodiversity change in the North Pacific 
 
We investigated reports and other publications 
regarding marine biodiversity in Korean coastal and 
offshore waters (MOF, 2006–2013, 2008–2013). 
According to this literature and other products from 
many existing research activities, it is suggested that 
the key drivers of biodiversity change include 
climate change, eutrophication, and various factors 
which are spatially categorized in the following.  
 
Coastal waters 
 
Regional effects 
 
• Coastal development: Diversity and habitats of 
many tidal flats/wetland organisms along the 
western part of the Korean peninsula is seriously 
threatened by reclamation and dike constructions 
which have reduced 36% of the Korean coastal 
tidal flats in the past 45 years.  
• Eutrophication: Diversity change is becoming 
evident as a result of increased coastal 
eutrophication brought about by increasing coastal 
aquaculture practices as well as by nutrient flow 
from rivers or streams.  
• Hypoxia: Coastal eutrophication is manifested by 
seasonal hypoxia of the local environment, 
leading to the disappearance of local species.  
• Pollution: Rising pollution (chemical and non-
chemical) from increasing human activities are 
impacting species biodiversity and spatial 
distribution.  
• Over-fishing: Intense over-fishing is endangering 
many important commercial fisheries as well as 
general fish species caught as fisheries byproduct.  
 
Global effects 
  
• Global warming: There is increased reporting on 
warm-water indicator species along Korean 
coastal waters, mostly likely owing to increasing 
water temperature due to global environmental 
changes.  
  
Section 2  Key Drivers of Biodiversity Change 
PICES Scientific Report No. 49  15 
• Whitening/bleaching events: These events are 
being observed more frequently, and in wider 
areas, most likely due to increasing water 
temperature and/or increasing pollutants. These 
expanding whitening events are impacting 
diversity changes of algae species and therefore, 
the herbivores feeding on them.  
 
Off-shore waters 
 
• Global warming: The distribution scale of warm-
water species is affected by increasing sea surface 
temperature.  
• Ocean acidification: The distribution and 
diversity of marine calcifiers are expected to be 
impacted by global ocean acidification. 
 
Biodiversity research initiatives in Korea 
 
Basic tools for the understanding, conservation, and 
management of biodiversity is evaluation and 
monitoring using survey works. In Korea, the results 
of such marine biodiversity surveys have been used 
as a basic framework for evaluation measures for 
conservation policy making.  
 
The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries (previously 
known as the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and 
Fisheries) enacted the Conservation and 
Management of Marine Ecosystems Act in 2006. This 
Act includes several research projects such as the 
National Investigation of Marine Ecosystem, 
National Wetland Survey, Marine Protected Area 
Survey (21 sites), and Marine Biological Resources 
Survey.  
 
The National Fisheries Research and Development 
Institute (NFRDI) has carried out a National Serial 
Oceanographic Survey since 1965. The main surveys 
are usually divided into several sections of the 
maritime area and are conducted at intervals of 
seasons or months. Results from marine species 
surveys found up to 9,534 species, including 6,110 
(64.1%) animal species, 1,048 (11.0%) plant species, 
2,172 (22.8%) phytoplankton species, and 204 (2.1%) 
zooplankton species in the Korea marine ecosystem. 
Among those species, 1,141 (955 animal species and 
186 plant species) are found along coastal wetlands. 
 
Knowledge gaps 
 
In Korea, the main reasons for biodiversity decrease 
are habitat destruction, eutrophication and other 
factors caused by increasing human activity. Based 
on these observations, the government of Korea has 
been conducting a biodiversity survey of coastal 
ecosystems, as stipulated in its related Acts and 
regulations, along Korean coastal waters at every 10-
year period. These surveys also help to gather other 
coastal environmental data and related factors of 
diversity. However, it is not easy to clarify the key 
drivers of biodiversity even with the accumulated 
information because there are not enough regional 
and spatial baseline data for biodiversity from the 
current set of data to estimate current biodiversity 
richness or poorness. So the first challenge is to 
identify the baseline status quo from which trends in 
marine biodiversity change could be detected at the 
relevant spatial and temporal scales.  
 
Climate change is expected to be one of the major 
environmental challenges of the 21st century, and 
various models predict a 2–4°C rise in water 
temperature in the current century. On-going climate 
change will likely cause shifts in the diversity and 
productivity of marine organisms due to the 
expansion of subtropical conditions and the 
simultaneous shrinking of polar environments 
(Sarmiento et al., 2004; Polovina et al., 2011; Chust 
et al., 2014).  
 
In Korean waters, the impacts of increasing water 
temperature will provide an ecosystem more suitable 
to subtropical organisms of various taxonomic 
groups, and there are now increasing reports of such 
observations in the Korean marine ecosystems. 
However, the waters surrounding the Korean 
peninsula are strongly influenced by warm currents 
branching out from the north equatorial current and 
Kuroshio current. Such warm water currents act as a 
conveyor belt entraining subtropical species 
northward into Korean waters. Therefore, a 
preliminary assessment of observed warm water 
subtropical species needs to be determined as to 
whether they have been carried in by warm water 
currents or are due to climate change processes. 
When that information has been collected, then a 
more accurate assessment can be carried out for 
observed subtropical species.  
 
Usually, exotic species have been introduced by man 
and by unknown passages. Many non-native species 
have been introduced for commercial purposes, 
including ornamental uses, and some have been 
transported by undesirable methods such as 
discharged water from ship ballast systems. Some 
Key Drivers of Biodiversity Change  Section 2 
16  PICES Scientific Report No. 49 
artificially introduced species have been helpful, but 
most often invasive species, including unexpected 
species, are ruining the ecosystem by removing 
endemic species. This observation is often noted in 
the marine ecosystem. A total 103 introduced species 
have been reported (MOE, 2012). Of those, 19 
species are marine invertebrates. However, any 
evidence of their ecological impact in the field is 
barely known. Some of them may change the local 
biodiversity of their distribution range, but it is also 
understood that strong knowledge gaps exist on such 
matters.  
 
Key scientific questions related to drivers of 
biodiversity change and biodiversity conservation 
that could be addressed through PICES 
 
It is difficult to judge which biodiversity changes are 
due to human impact or due to climate change, but 
most evidence suggests that coastal and open ocean 
marine species are under heavy pressure in most 
parts of the world from the following factors: 
• Over-exploitation of resources; 
• Pollution and eutrophication; 
• Introduction of invasive ‘alien’ species; 
• Habitat destruction (e.g., reclamation and grand-
scale dike construction);  
• Global climate change and ocean acidification. 
 
Therefore, the aforementioned key biodiversity 
drivers of the Korean marine system and other 
factors are needed to be reviewed by SG-BC. 
However, since many activities are within the scope 
of the SG, a limited and focused study should be 
decided by the Group:  
• Selection of target species for the study after 
soliciting and collecting opinions from marine 
ecologists and biologists of each member country, 
and then reviewed by SG-BC; 
• Gathering of global data, or data from each 
member country, of targeted species after which 
material will be processed and organized by SG-
BC for drawing up the status quo current state 
and results on the future forecasts;   
• Exchange of information on biodiversity programs 
and other research results; such efforts could 
contribute in the enhancement of research 
capacity of North Pacific biodiversity.

The United States has the largest exclusive economic 
zone in the world, most of it centered around the 
North Pacific.  U.S. Pacific waters stretch from the 
Eastern Pacific to Guam and the Mariana Islands in 
the West, including tropical, temperate and polar 
biomes, and everything from coastal ecosystems to 
the world’s deepest submarine trench.  This broad 
biogeographic extent means that the U.S. shares 
ecosystems and species with many North Pacific 
nations and can benefit from a shared understanding 
of their biodiversity. The U.S. also participates in a 
number of regional organizations with responsibilities 
that may have consequences for marine biodiversity.  
It is the policy of the United States to protect, 
maintain, and restore the health and biological 
diversity of ocean and coastal ecosystems and 
resources (CEQ, 2010). 
 
Key drivers of biodiversity change in the North Pacific  
 
The primary drivers of change in marine biodiversity 
loss have been identified in numerous documents 
(e.g., NRC, 1995) and include: 
• Coastal habitat modification (e.g., loss of coastal 
wetlands, nearshore development, nearshore 
mining); 
• Fisheries impacts, particularly habitat damage 
from mobile bottom-contact gear (bottom trawls), 
bycatch, and overfishing;  
• Land-based pollution, including chemical pollution 
and eutrophication; 
• Invasive species;  
• Climate change, including coral bleaching, 
changes in species distributions, and impacts on 
biodiversity from changing currents, sea-level rise, 
and rainfall/freshwater input patterns;  
• Ocean acidification (NOAA Ocean Acidification 
Steering Committee, 2010), particularly impacts 
on the calcification by a wide range of organisms, 
including many keystone species in North Pacific 
ecosystems. 
 
These stressors have affected, and may yet affect, 
marine biodiversity from the intertidal zone to the 
deep sea. With the exception of climate change and 
ocean acidification, the impacts of these drivers 
generally become less intense as one moves farther 
from land. However, fishing impacts in particular are 
thought to be an important contributor to biodiversity 
loss in areas beyond national jurisdiction (Worm et 
al., 2006).    
 
U.S. biodiversity initiatives in the North Pacific 
 
The U.S. has significant capacity for marine 
biodiversity research in the academic and 
government sectors, and a large number of initiatives 
that touch on providing information needed to 
advance conservation of ocean biodiversity in the 
North Pacific.  Most of these are directed toward 
specific geographies within U.S. waters, or to 
specific research questions.  For the purposes of the 
SG-BC, we selected a few initiatives that we feel 
would benefit in particular from collaboration or 
linkages with other PICES members: 
• Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON;
7
 
Duffy et al., 2013).  In October 2014, a consortium 
of U.S. agencies announced three pilot projects, 
two of which have sentinel sites along the 
California coast. 
• National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration:  
o Deep Sea Coral Research & Technology 
Program
8
 (Field Research Initiatives in the 
Northeast Pacific, 2010–2014; U.S. Pacific 
Islands, 2015–2017), and National Deep-Sea 
Coral and Sponge Database; 
o Ocean Exploration and Research9 – Various 
exploration expeditions in the North Pacific, 
including planned ROV expeditions in 2015–
2017; 
o Coral Reef Conservation Program10 – Coral 
Reef Biodiversity Monitoring and participation 
in the Census of Marine Life’s Census of 
Coral Reefs Ecosystems; 
o Ocean Acidification Program 11 – An 
important area of focus includes studying the 
biological responses of marine species to 
changing ocean chemistry.  The Program is 
coordinating internationally to develop a 
global Ocean Acidification Observing Network 
(Newton et al., 2012);

These programs have the conservation of

• Smithsonian Institution – National Museum of 
Natural History.
15
  The Smithsonian Institution 
was a principal player in the Census of Marine 
Life efforts, and its Tennenbaum Marine 
Observatories are a new effort to develop a 
worldwide network of coastal ecological field 
sites, standardizing measurements of biological 
change. 
 
In addition to these initiatives to study biodiversity, 
the U.S. is engaged in a large number of 
collaborations designed to support ecosystem 
approaches to ocean resource management.  Species 
diversity is a vital component of maintaining healthy, 
productive and resilient ecosystems that can provide 
services to the U.S. population. The goal of 
maintaining healthy and productive fisheries has led 
NOAA’s Fisheries Service to develop monitoring 
programs that directly measure diversity in the North 
Pacific. As an example, the species diversity and 
composition of copepods in the California Current 
system has been shown to affect the survival and 
growth of salmon species (Peterson, 2009). Thus, 
copepod species richness is monitored annually in 
Oregon and Washington. As another example, the 
stock assessment and fishery evaluation reports for 
Alaskan groundfish and crab species provide 
information useful to monitoring the Alaskan 
ecosystems (Zador et al., 2013). The information 
includes indicators of biodiversity that are updated 
annually from existing data collection programs. For 
example, biodiversity indicators (species richness 
and evenness) are monitored biennially in the eastern 
Bering Sea slope using bottom trawl survey data. 
These data integrate the effects of climate change, 
ocean acidification and fishing activity and can be 
used to monitor changes over time. 
 
The U.S. also participates in a number of 
international activities related to marine biodiversity 
including: 
• The Ocean Biogeographic Information System 
(OBIS), a global network of regional and thematic

International Oceanographic Commission (IOC). 
The U.S. node, OBIS-USA,
16
 has been a leader in 
the OBIS activity since it was first proposed for 
adoption by the IOC.  PICES participant countries 
with OBIS nodes include Canada, China, Korea, 
Japan, and the U.S.; 
• Involvement in global efforts to capture scientific 
data for use in international fora.  As an example, 
OBIS has been a major contributor to CBD EBSA 
efforts.  Duke University (OBIS SEAMAP) has 
led several regional workshops on this topic; 
• Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS);
17
   
• Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity 
Observation Network (GEO BON).

Important knowledge gaps in scientific information 
needed to address biodiversity and  
conservation issues 
 
Biological diversity spans many levels, from 
intraspecific genetic variation, through species 
diversity, to ecosystem and habitat-level diversity.  
The amount of information available at each of these 
levels and among different categories within each 
level varies widely.  For example, genetic variation 
within species is known only for a small number of 
taxa – generally vertebrates of particular economic or 
conservation interest (e.g., salmon).  Species richness 
is known for a broader array of taxa, but abundance 
measures are often lacking for all but marine 
mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish species.  
Ecosystem- or habitat-level diversity can often be 
crudely approximated, based on certain physical or 
chemical or ocean measurements, but often lacks 
metrics for comparing results among different regions 
(e.g., consistent habitat classification systems). In 
general, knowledge of marine biodiversity also 
decreases with depth and distance from shore.   
 
In addition to these issues, there is no formal 
mechanism to implement monitoring, collating of 
existing data or maintaining ongoing data on 
biodiversity in U.S. waters. There is also a lack of 
uniform biodiversity measures that can be compared 
among ecosystems in the North Pacific region. These 
are challenges for recognizing changes in

biodiversity in a timely manner when they may occur. 
Given these variables, it becomes particularly 
important to specify the biodiversity or conservation 
objectives or questions that will be addressed.  This 
will determine the most appropriate biodiversity 
metrics to answer those questions.  
 
1. Objective:  Understanding marine biodiversity 
 
• Factors that contribute to local biodiversity (e.g., 
for specific biomes or habitat types) and their 
susceptibility to particular anthropogenic impacts.  
Users: fishery and sanctuary managers; 
• Networking pilot projects across the North Pacific. 
 
2. Objective: Identifying marine biodiversity 
priorities for spatial management 
 
• Delineation of benthic and pelagic biogeographic 
ecoregions in the North Pacific is a first step in 
identification of regional biodiversity patterns that 
can help assess how current and proposed 
management measures (e.g., marine protected 
areas or spatial gear restrictions) are expected to 
affect regional biodiversity.  These can build upon 
Spaulding et al. (2007) and UNESCO (2009); 
• Development of consistent habitat classification 
schemes for the North Pacific (e.g., FGDC, 2012 
or Greene et al., 1999); 
• Identification of deepwater biogenic habitats 
vulnerable to impacts from bottom-contact fishing 
gear: 
• Development of habitat suitability models (e.g., 
Yeeson et al., 2012) for key biogenic habitat-
forming species (e.g., corals or sponges); 
• In areas beyond national jurisdiction, this will 
contribute to the identification of vulnerable 
marine ecosystems (VMEs) needed to advise 
the North Pacific Fisheries Commission 
(NPFC) and prevent serious adverse impacts to 
VMEs;   
• Identification of ecologically and biologically 
significant areas (EBSAs) in the deep sea and 
open ocean in support of the Convention on 
Biological Diversity (CBD), and specifying 
commonalities with regional VMEs.  There 
may also be commonalities with the criteria 
for the International Seabed Authority’s 
“Areas of Particular Environmental Interest” 
and the International Maritime Organization’s 
“Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas.” 
 
3. Objective: Identifying biodiversity metrics or 
proxies for use in monitoring changes due to 
climate change and ocean acidification 
 
• Identification of reference points for biodiversity 
indicators for different marine ecosystems; 
• Identification of indicators or proxies for marine 
biodiversity in different ecosystems;  
• Development of models to predict the impacts of 
climate change or ocean acidification on species 
distribution and biodiversity patterns. 
 
4. Objective:  Identifying opportunities for international 
cooperation on biodiversity studies 
 
• Identification of planned biodiversity research 
expeditions that may benefit from international 
participation or information dissemination.  End 
users: participating countries and NPFC. 
 
Conclusions 
 
From our perspective, three key questions for the SG 
are as follows: 
    
1. What could PICES add to existing regional 
processes or efforts (e.g., science advice to the 
NPFC)? 
 
2. What added value can be gained by networking 
biodiversity information at the ocean basin level 
(e.g., contributing to existing biodiversity database 
efforts or networking among study sites at similar 
latitudes)? 
 
3. Can a PICES science effort contribute to 
identifying biodiversity metrics that could be used 
at the North Pacific ocean basin level for 
monitoring impacts of climate change or ocean 
acidification?
 
 
  
Key Drivers of Biodiversity Change  Section 2 
20  PICES Scientific Report No. 49 
2.7 Summary of drivers, research initiatives 
and priorities for biodiversity research  
in the North Pacific Ocean 
PICES member countries identified key drivers of 
biodiversity change in coastal and offshore ecosystems. 
These include:  
 
Coastal ecosystems 
 
• The introduction, establishment and spread of 
non-indigenous species leading to loss of species 
and habitats (e.g., Spartina alterniflora); 
• Overfishing leading to declines in fishery 
resources, declines in the diversity of fishes, 
invertebrates, and structure-forming (biogenic) 
species, and/or degradation or loss of habitat; 
• Coastal habitat modification (e.g., land reclamation, 
nearshore development, nearshore mining, beach 
access) leading to loss of coastal wetlands, 
mangroves and other ecosystems; 
• Land-based nutrient (organic) pollution leading to 
eutrophication and harmful algal blooms; 
• Land-based chemical (inorganic) pollution 
leading to bioaccumulation of toxins and fitness 
consequences for a broad range of taxa; 
• Hypoxia; 
• Sediment runoff; 
• Light pollution; 
• Fish farming leading to nutrient and other types of 
pollution; 
• Oil spills associated with increased maritime 
transport; 
• Climate change leading to coral bleaching, 
changes in species distribution and other impacts 
associated with sea-level rise, and changing 
currents, temperature regimes, and rainfall/ 
freshwater input patterns; 
• Ocean acidification leading to impacts on 
calcification;  
• Large-scale climatic, ultraviolet radiation, and 
oceanographic changes leading to impacts on 
population demography and changes in the 
number and distribution of species;  
• Establishment of MPAs leading to a recovery of 
biodiversity. 
 
Offshore ecosystems 
 
• Introduction, establishment and spread of non-
indigenous species leading to loss of native 
species and habitats; 
• Overfishing leading to declines in fishery 
resources, diversity of fishes and invertebrates 
and structure-forming (biogenic) species, and/or 
degradation or loss of habitat including biogenic 
structures; 
• Deep-sea mining leading to habitat loss (e.g., 
metallic sulfides or cobalt-rich crusts); 
• Climate change leading to changes in species 
distributions, currents, and temperature and 
rainfall patterns; 
• Ocean acidification leading to impacts on 
calcification; 
• Marine pollution (e.g., derelict fishing gear, 
plastics, persistent organic pollutants); 
• Oil spills associated with maritime transport and 
offshore oil exploitation; 
• Large-scale climatic, ultraviolet radiation, and 
oceanographic changes leading to impacts on 
population demography and changes in the 
number and distribution of species.  
 
Fautin et al. (2010) reviewed factors that influence 
marine biodiversity in the United States, which are 
largely similar to those affecting ecosystems in the 
North Pacific Ocean. These included over-
exploitation, degradation of water quality, invasive 
species, rising sea temperatures, increasing surface 
concentrations of CO
2
, shifting currents, and an 
increasing number and size of hypoxic or anoxic 
areas. Coastal development and shipping were 
identified as activities associated with consequences 
for biodiversity. However, the direct and indirect 
effects of fishing were identified as the greatest 
threat to marine biodiversity. Specifically, fishing-
related impacts included severe depletions of upper-
trophic level predators and cascading food web 
interactions, selective removals, and alteration of the 
structure of benthic communities.  
 
Parsons et al. (2014) reviewed the major threats to 
biodiversity, including exploitation, marine pollution, 
climate change, and the introduction of non-
indigenous species. Collectively, fisheries are 
exerting major changes to biodiversity in the North 
Pacific Ocean. Of the commercially fished species 
that have been assessed, at least 87% are fully 
exploited, over-exploited or depleted (FAO, 2012; 
Parsons et al., 2014). As the global distribution of 
fishing effort increases in terms of spatial extent and 
depth (Morato et al., 2006; Swartz et al., 2010, as in 
Parsons et al., 2014), so too does the biodiversity 
affected by fishing. As the global human population 
size increases, so do the impacts of coastal 
Section 2  Key Drivers of Biodiversity Change 
PICES Scientific Report No. 49  21 
development and input of environmental pollutants 
to the world’s oceans (Islam and Tanaka, 2004, as in 
Parsons et al., 2014). This concentration of human 
activities in coastal ecosystems has led to increases 
in pollutant discharges into marine ecosystems, 
ingestion of inorganic contaminants by marine biota 
(e.g., Avery-Gomm et al., 2012, as in Parsons et al., 
2014), introduction of persistent organic pollutants 
(Braune et al., 2005, as in Parsons et al., 2014), 
spread of non-indigenous species (Bax et al., 2003, 
as in Parsons et al., 2014), and oil spills (Hjorth and 
Nielsen, 2011, as in Parsons et al., 2014). The 
impacts of overfishing, coastal development, marine 
pollution, and spread of non-indigenous species on 
the distributions of biota are further compounded by 
a changing ocean environment that is predicted to 
warm and acidify with higher sea level, and changes 
in ocean circulation and storm regimes (IPCC 2013, 
as in Parsons et al., 2014). 
 
Research priorities 
 
PICES was conceived as a means of avoiding the 
duplication of scientific activities, and in 1992, 
Governing Council underscored “a role of PICES 
with respect to other organizations would be to 
supply advice through Science Board and relevant 
scientific committees.” Thus, in addition to 
identifying key drivers of biodiversity change, 
members of SG-BC identified priorities for 
biodiversity research and the types of advice that are 
needed to inform ecosystem-based management in 
the North Pacific Ocean. These include:  
• Identifying indicators or proxies for marine 
biodiversity in different ecosystems; 
• Identifying reference points for biodiversity 
indicators for different marine ecosystems; 
• Developing a monitoring strategy to assess the 
current state of biodiversity and monitor long-
term trends in distribution and abundance; 
• Identifying areas that differ in the rates of 
biodiversity change, and potential drivers causing 
these changes; 
• Delineating benthic and pelagic biogeographic 
ecoregions in the North Pacific;  
• Understanding the factors that contribute to local 
biodiversity (e.g., for specific biomes or habitat 
types) and their susceptibility to particular 
anthropogenic impacts;   
• Predicting impacts of climate change and other 
drivers on species distribution and biodiversity 
patterns; 
• Mapping biodiversity hotspot testing for 
correspondence with hotspots of stressors/ pressures;  
• Understanding the cumulative impacts of drivers 
of biodiversity change; 
• Identifying VMEs, including deepwater biogenic 
habitats that are impacted by bottom-contact 
fishing gear;  
• Identifying EBSAs in the deep sea and open 
ocean in support of the Convention on Biological 
Diversity, and specifying commonalities with 
regional VMEs, the International Seabed 
Authority’s Areas of Particular Environmental 
Interest and the International Maritime 
Organization’s Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas; 
• Developing effective tools for MPA network 
design and marine zoning;   
• Developing effective means of controlling and 
managing ballast water (e.g., inspection systems), 
particularly near international harbours; 
• Understanding the vectors of non-indigenous 
species transport. 
 
SG-BC also noted that the identification of 
biodiversity indicators and reference points is needed 
for assessing the status of biodiversity in different 
marine ecosystems and informing ecosystem-based 
management decisions. Delineation of biogeographic 
ecoregions is a first step in the identification of 
regional biodiversity patterns that can help assess 
how current and proposed management measures 
(e.g., MPAs or spatial gear restrictions) are expected 
to affect regional biodiversity and serve as an input 
in marine zoning and MPA network design. 
Identification of VMEs is needed to advise the NPFC 
and prevent serious adverse impacts to VMEs. 
Mechanisms to Advance Biodiversity-based Research  Section 3 
22  PICES Scientific Report No. 49 
3 Potential Mechanisms to Advance Biodiversity-based Scientific 
Research in the North Pacific Ocean 
 
In its initial review, SG-BC identified a range of 
mechanisms to advance biodiversity-based research in 
the North Pacific Ocean. These include mechanisms 
related to the coordination of information management, 
analyses, and resources such as:  
• Construction of regional databases of VME 
indicator species, and biogenic species that 
support local biodiversity; 
• Development of monitoring programs and rapid 
response plans to detect and manage changes in 
biodiversity and the distribution of non-indigenous 
species; 
• Development of risk assessment tools; 
• Identification of pathways of effects (e.g., vectors 
of non-indigenous species introductions); 
• Development of species distribution models for 
indicator species (e.g., VME indicators) and 
biodiversity indices; 
• Development and evaluation of options for 
encounter protocols to prevent serious adverse 
impacts to VMEs; 
• Development of genetic tools to quantify 
population connectivity for key taxa at the North 
Pacific basin scale;  
• Identification of planned biodiversity research 
expeditions that may benefit from international 
participation or information dissemination. 
 
The United States noted that there is no formal 
mechanism for implementing monitoring, collating 
existing data or maintaining ongoing data on 
biodiversity in its domestic waters. There is also a 
lack of uniform biodiversity measures that can be 
compared among ecosystems in the North Pacific 
region. These are challenges for recognizing changes in 
biodiversity in a timely manner when they may occur.
The United States identified two additional mechanisms 
to advance biodiversity research: 
1. Networking pilot projects across the North Pacific 
Ocean; 
2. Planning biodiversity research expeditions that 
may benefit from international participation or 
information dissemination.   
 
Specific tools for advancing biodiversity research 
included:  
• Databases of biogenic habitat-forming species 
that contribute to local biodiversity (e.g., deep-sea 
corals and sponges); 
• Habitat suitability models for deep-sea corals and 
sponges; 
• Genetic tools to identify population connectivity 
for these and other key taxa at the North Pacific 
basin scale; 
• Models and predictive maps of the spatial 
distribution of biodiversity; 
• Ecosystem models that can predict the effects of 
human activities or climate change on 
biodiversity (i.e., EcoPath, EcoSim models); 
• Monitoring programs to detect changes in 
biodiversity. 
 
Rapid and open access to spatially and temporally 
referenced data is recognized as essential for 
recognizing changes as they occur and informing 
timely management decisions (Hall et al., 2010, as 
cited in CCA, 2012). Fautin et al. (2010) noted the 
importance of developing data management techniques 
to ensure that scales and survey methods are 
compatible, that taxonomic changes are updated 
automatically, and that biotic and abiotic data are 
interactively linked. Key changes for managing data 
effectively include financial constraints and limited 
taxonomic expertise.   
 
Section 4  Research Activities  
PICES Scientific Report No. 49  23 
4 Review of Research Activities Undertaken by PICES and 
Other International Organizations on Biodiversity in  
the North Pacific Ocean  
 
Keyword searches of “biodiversity” and 
“conservation” in PICES’ Annual Reports indicate 
that PICES’ interests in biodiversity research and 
conservation have steadily increased since its 
establishment in 1992. The review also showed that a 
number of PICES expert groups have incorporated 
biodiversity-related research objectives into their 
Actions Plans. The number of proposed and accepted 
topic sessions related to biodiversity or conservation 
at PICES Annual Meetings has also increased over 
time. However, PICES has published relatively few 
reports that specifically address biodiversity research 
or conservation issues (but see Alexander et al., 2001; 
Jamieson and Zhang, 2005; Jamieson et al., 2010).   
4.1 Biodiversity research published by PICES 
expert groups 
Most of the biodiversity research published by 
PICES expert groups relates to identification of 
biodiversity indicators and the Census of Marine Life 
(CoML). Note this review does not include an 
exhaustive search of primary papers produced by 
members of PICES expert groups.  
 
In the reports of the Study Group on Ecosystem-Based 
Management Science and its Application to the North 
Pacific and the Working Group on Ecosystem-Based 
Management Science and its Application to the North 
Pacific (WG 19), biodiversity conservation was 
identified as a key objective for ecosystem-based 
management (Jamieson and Zhang, 2005; Jamieson et 
al., 2010). Specifically, WG 19 provided a detailed 
analysis of indicators for use in supporting ecosystem 
monitoring and management, including biodiversity 
indicators. PICES also published a Scientific Report 
on integration of ecological indicators (No. 33, Kruse 
et al., 2006) based on the PICES/NPRB Workshop on 
“Integration of ecological indicators of the North 
Pacific with emphasis on the Bering Sea”.  
The Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop 
on “Impact of Climate Variability on Observation 
and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity 
Changes in the North Pacific” (PICES Sci. Rep. No. 
18, Alexander et al., 2001) provided an overview of 
initiatives and strategies for monitoring, understanding 
and predicting changes in biodiversity in the North 
Pacific Ocean.  
4.2 Biodiversity-related research or activities 
led by PICES Committees and  
expert groups  
PICES Committees and expert groups that have 
undertaken research specifically focused on 
biodiversity or conservation include the Marine 
Environmental Quality (MEQ), Fishery Science (FIS) 
and Biological Oceanography (BIO) committees, 
Working Groups (WG 19, Ecosystem-based 
Management Science and its Application to the 
North Pacific; WG 21, Non-indigenous Aquatic 
Species; WG 28,  Development of Ecosystem Indicators 
to Characterize Ecosystem Responses to Multiple 
Stressors) and the Advisory Panel on Marine Birds 
and Mammals. PICES’ scientific program, FUTURE, 
also addresses biodiversity issues. Most PICES 
activities related to biodiversity and conservation 
have been undertaken in the last 10–15 years, and 
highlights are summarized below.   
 
MEQ identified biodiversity, species introductions 
and unintentional introductions of exotic species as 
ecological health issues in its draft 2006 Action Plan. 
Other issues considered in the Action Plan were 
anthropogenic impacts on benthic habitat (formerly 
described in the Plan as “trawling effects on benthic 
habitat”) and anthropogenic impacts on trophic 
dynamics and biodiversity that impact system 
sustainability. In 2003, MEQ, BIO and FIS convened 
a Topic Session (S10) on “Ecosystem-based 
Research Activities  Section 4 
24  PICES Scientific Report No. 49 
management science and its application to the North 
Pacific” (PICES XII). 
 
Starting at the 2004 PICES Annual Meeting, MEQ 
has convened or co-convened:  
• MEQ Topic Session (S6) on “Marine Protected 
Areas” (PICES XIII, 2004); 
• MEQ Workshop (W2) on “Introduced species in 
the North Pacific”, co-sponsored by ICES (PICES 
XIV, 2005).  
 
Together, MEQ and FIS have organized several topic 
sessions or workshops related to biodiversity 
conservation and emerging scientific questions 
surrounding the identification of VMEs and EBSAs. 
These include: 
• MEQ/FIS Workshop (W3) on “Criteria relevant 
to the determination of unit eco-regions for 
ecosystem-based management in the PICES area” 
(PICES XV, 2006);  
• MEQ/FIS Topic Session (S7)  on “Coldwater 
biogenic habitat in the North Pacific” (PICES 
XVI, 2007);  
• MEQ/FIS Topic Session (S6)  on “Marine spatial 
planning in support of integrated management 
tools, methods, and approaches”,  co-sponsored 
by NOWPAP (PICES-2009);  
• MEQ/FIS Topic Session (S11) on “Identifying 
vulnerable marine ecosystems in the North 
Pacific”, co-sponsored by NPFMC (PICES-2010).  
 
BIO has convened:  
• BIO Topic Session (S4) on “Census of Marine 
Life – Exploring ocean life:  Past, present and 
future” (PICES- 2010); 
• BIO/POC Topic Session (S2) on “Mechanisms of 
physical-biological coupling forcing biological 
hotspots” (PICES-2011).  
 
WG 19 has produced two reports that identify 
biodiversity conservation as a key objective for 
ecosystem-based management, and review biodiversity 
indicators appropriate for monitoring and managing 
ecosystems (Jamieson and Zhang 2005; Jamieson et 
al., 2010). 
 
Working Group (WG 21) on Non-indigenous Aquatic 
Species met for a 2-day joint meeting on Non-
indigenous Aquatic Species with ICES Working 
Group on Introductions and Transfers of Marine 
Organisms (WGITMO) and with ICES/IOC/IMO 
Working Group on Ballast and other Ship Vectors 
(WGBOSBV) in Cambridge, USA (May 2007).
The Study Group on Future Integrative Scientific 
Program(s) (SG-FISP, 2005–2009) identified 
biodiversity, species introductions and unintentional 
introductions of exotic species as one of six themes 
for a new PICES scientific program prior to PICES 
XIV. The recommendations from SG-FISP led to the 
establishment of PICES’ integrative scientific 
program FUTURE (Forecasting and Understanding 
Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific 
Ecosystems).  
 
PICES has co-convened workshops with other 
organizations including:  
• A 3-day PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on 
“Impact of climate variability on observation and 
prediction of ecosystem and biodiversity changes 
in the North Pacific”, March 7–9, 2001, 
Honolulu, USA (see Appendix 4); 
• A 1-day PICES/CKJORC Workshop (W5) on 
“Regional cooperation for the conservation and 
management of the marine environment and 
resources in the Yellow Sea” (PICES XI, 2002); 
• A ½-day KORDI/PICES/CoML workshop on 
“Variability and status of the Yellow Sea and East 
China Sea ecosystems”, October 3, 2003, Seoul, 
Korea (see Appendix 4);  
• A 3-day PICES/CoML Regional marine life 
expert workshop, November 17–19, 2003, 
Victoria, Canada; 
 
Representatives from PICES have also participated 
in workshops held by other organizations, including 
a workshop on Ecologically and Biologically 
Significant Areas, convened by the Convention on 
Biological Diversity Secretariat in Moscow, Russia 
(February 2013), and a workshop on “Marine 
biodiversity conservation and marine protected 
areas in the Northwest Pacific”, convened by 
NOWPAP in Toyama, Japan (March 2013) (see 
Appendix 4). 
 
A theme section in the journal Marine Ecological 
Progress Series Volume 487 on biophysical coupling 
of marine hotspots was based on PICES Topic 
Session S2 at PICES-2011 (Hazen et al., 2013a).  
 
Most recently, PICES has contributed to the World 
Ocean Assessment Chapter 36C
19
 on the status of 
marine biological diversity and habitats in the North 
Pacific Ocean.

4.3 Activities undertaken by international 
organizations 
Adrianov (2004) provides a review of activities 
undertaken by international organizations in the 
western and northern Pacific Ocean.  
 
• DIVERSITAS
20
 was launched to study and monitor 
biodiversity and ecosystem function; 
• The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission 
of UNESCO developed a Register of Marine 
Organisms,
21
 a checklist of all marine species;  
• DIWPA
22
 (DIVERSITAS in Western Pacific and 
Asia) was established to promote cooperative 
studies on biodiversity and ecosystems; 
• DIWPA developed a regional strategy for 
studying ecosystems from the subarctic areas to 
New Zealand, and established 21 coastal areas for 
long-term annual monitoring; seven are in the 
western Pacific Ocean; 
• The Census of Marine Life
23
 (CoML) was 
established to explain biological diversity and 
distribution in the world’s oceans; 
• NaGISA
24
 (Natural Geography in Shore Areas) 
aimed to assess and study marine biodiversity in 
macrophyte coastal communities of the West and 
North Pacific Ocean.  
 
A number of international organizations have 
engaged in scientific activities related to biodiversity

 is an 
international organization working to define EBSAs 
in the world’s oceans (Williams et al., 2010, as in 
Hazen et al., 2013a). The workshop on Ecologically 
and Biologically Significant Areas held in 2013 in 
Moscow (see above)  evaluated EBSAs in the North 
Pacific Ocean. Key EBSAs identified during that 
workshop included those in the domestic waters of 
Mexico and Russia, as well as the Emperor 
Seamount Chain, seamounts and hydrothermal vents 
in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, and the transition 
zone. However, most of the areas in the high seas, 
including the majority of seamounts and the abyssal 
plain were not evaluated.  
 
Related to EBSAs are vulnerable marine ecosystems. 
The NPFC
26
 Scientific Working Group has as one of 
its priorities to identify VMEs in the convention area. 
NPFC held a joint workshop on VME identification 
with FAO in Tokyo, Japan, in March 2014 and a 
workshop on VME identification and encounter 
protocols in Tokyo, Japan, in August 2014. The 
criteria for VME identification have yet to be defined 
and applied in the convention area.  
 
Other international organizations undertaking 
biodiversity research in the North Pacific Ocean 
include the International Network for Scientific 
Investigation of Deep-Sea Ecosystems (INDEEP),

Opportunities for Collaboration  Section 5 
26  PICES Scientific Report No. 49 
  
  
 
 
5 Potential Opportunities for Collaborations between PICES and 
Other International Organizations  
 
SG-BC recognized that countries and international 
organizations have developed action plans and have 
carried out biodiversity research at global, regional 
and national levels in recent years, including the 
Convention on Biological Diversity, International 
Biodiversity Program, Millennium Ecosystem 
Assessment, and Census of Marine Life. SG 
members identified potential opportunities for 
collaboration with other organizations to undertake 
or support biodiversity research in the North Pacific 
Ocean. Key opportunities include:  
• Collaboration with the North Pacific Fisheries 
Commission (NPFC) to identify the location of 
VMEs in the convention area. In its 2008 annual 
report, MEQ proposed that PICES has the 
scientific expertise and capacity to evaluate the 
appropriateness of criteria relevant to the 
determination of VMEs in the North Pacific and 
to evaluate the adequacy of the information 
available to apply the criteria. NPFC identified 
PICES as a potential partner for VME 
identification and other scientific priorities at its 
Scientific Working Group Meeting held in 
Juneau, USA, in 2012. More recently, the NPFC 
Interim Secretariat supported the idea of 
developing a formal collaboration with PICES. In 
addition, ongoing work conducted in the South 
Pacific Regional Fishery Management Organization 
(SPREFMO) region may have direct applicability 
for similar PICES work in the North Pacific; 
• Collaboration with the CBD Secretariat to 
identify EBSAs in the North Pacific Ocean, with 
an emphasis on evaluating areas not yet assessed;  
• Collaboration with NOWPAP on biodiversity 
research, including topics related to non-
indigenous marine species. NOWPAP is one of 
the UNEP Regional Seas Programs.  During its 
term, WG 21 recognized the benefits of 
cooperation on marine non-indigenous species 
between PICES and NOWPAP. NOWPAP’s 
2012–2017 Strategy includes sharing information 
on the current status of biodiversity, including 
marine invasive species, and an application of 
international regulations for the prevention of 
alien species invasions. A joint PICES-NOWPAP 
Study Group on Scientific Cooperation in the 
North Pacific Ocean was formed in July 2014 
(SG-SCOOP);  
• Collaboration with ICES to understand drivers/ 
responses of Northern Hemisphere marine 
ecosystems to changes in biodiversity; 
• If a biodiversity expert group is established within 
PICES, it could develop a formal collaboration 
and affiliation with DIVERSITAS.  
 
The United States has significant capacity for marine 
biodiversity research in the academic and 
government sectors, and a large number of initiatives 
that touch on providing information needed to 
advance the conservation of ocean biodiversity in the 
North Pacific Ocean.  Most of these are directed 
toward specific geographies within U.S. waters, or to 
specific research questions.  Listed here are 
initiatives that would benefit from collaboration or 
linkages with other PICES members.  
 
• Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON; 
Duffy et al., 2013).  In October 2014, a consortium 
of U.S. agencies announced three pilot projects, 
two of which have sentinel sites along the 
California coast; 
• National Science Foundation; 
• Smithsonian Institution – National Museum of 
Natural History.  The Smithsonian Institution was 
a principal player in the Census of Marine Life 
efforts, and its Tennenbaum Marine Observatories 
are a new effort  to develop a worldwide network 
of coastal ecological field sites, standardizing 
measurements of biological change;

area of focus includes studying the biological 
responses of marine species to changing ocean 
chemistry.  The Program is coordinating 
internationally to develop a global Ocean 
Acidification Observing Network (Newton et 
al., 2012).

These programs have the conservation of 
biodiversity as a primary mandate.   
 
The U.S. also participates in a number of 
international activities related to marine biodiversity 
including: 
• The Ocean Biogeographic Information System 
(OBIS), a global network of regional and thematic 
(taxon-based) data nodes that is organized within 
the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Data and  
Information Exchange within UNESCO’s 
International Oceanographic Commission (IOC). 
The U.S. node, OBIS-USA, has been a leader in 
the OBIS activity since it was first proposed for 
adoption by the IOC.  OBIS has been involved in 
global efforts to capture scientific data for use in 
international fora.  As an example, OBIS has been 
a major contributor to CBD EBSA efforts.  Duke 
University (OBIS SEAMAP) has led several 
regional workshops on this topic. PICES 
participant countries with OBIS nodes include 
Canada, China, Korea, Japan, and the U.S.; 
• Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS);   
• Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity 
Observation Network (GEO BON).  
 
Furthermore, Ban et al. (2014) identified several 
international organizations that could potentially 
partner with PICES to address biodiversity-related 
research questions:  
• International Maritime Organization (IMO),
32
 which 
is responsible for safe and secure shipping and the 
prevention of marine pollution by ships; 
• International Seabed Authority (ISA),
33
 which 
controls exploration and exploitation of nonliving 
resources; 
• Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission 
(IOC),
34
 which leads international oceanographic 
research; 
• United Nations Environment Program (UNEP),
35
 
which coordinates activities and programs for 
conservation and sustainable use of oceans, 
including the Regional Seas Conventions and 
Action Plan.

Conclusions and Recommendations  Section 6 
28  PICES Scientific Report No. 49 
6 Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
6.1 Merits of establishing an expert group 
focused on biodiversity science  
 
SG-BC expressed support for PICES to establish an 
expert group on biodiversity and to engage in 
biodiversity science. The SG recognized it was an 
opportunity for PICES to link research to the 
activities and initiatives of other international 
organizations, including the North Pacific Fisheries 
Commission.  
 
SG-BC’s review of PICES past activities reveals that 
biodiversity science was recognized as a significant 
emerging issue by PICES as early as 2000 (see 
individual reports in the PICES Annual Report for 
2000). The Study Group on Future Integrative 
Scientific Program(s) identified the status and trends 
of marine biodiversity as an important theme for 
PICES in 2005 and in 2006, and FIS agreed that 
biodiversity was a topic of much interest to PICES 
member countries. Biodiversity and productivity of 
marine organisms was identified as one of six new 
frontiers at the PICES/ICES Early Career Scientists 
Conference on “New frontiers in marine science” in 
2007. In 2011, marine spatial planning was identified 
as one of four long-term research priority areas for 
PICES and ICES cooperation by the joint 
PICES/ICES Study Group on Developing a 
Framework for Scientific Cooperation in Northern 
Hemisphere Marine Science.  
 
In 2013, WG 21 proposed, as an option for an expert 
group, to establish a Section on conservation focused 
on drivers of change in biodiversity to address 
emerging international issues, including work 
advocated by NOWPAP and the Convention on 
Biological Diversity (CBD), to collaborate with the 
North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC) on 
identification of VMEs, and to study the effects of 
non-indigenous species on marine biodiversity. WG 
21 ultimately favoured the option to establish an 
Advisory Panel on Aquatic Non-indigenous Species 
in its final report.  
 
SG-BC identified climate change, pollution, fishing, 
coastal development, and the spread of non-
indigenous species as the key anthropogenic drivers 
of biodiversity change in the North Pacific Ocean. 
The SG also recognized that ecological interactions 
influence biodiversity patterns. When cross-
referenced against past and present PICES activities 
(see Table 1 in section 1), all drivers of biodiversity 
change were the subject of research by PICES 
member countries, with the exception of fishing. 
However, SG-BC noted that these research activities 
were not necessarily focused on biodiversity per se. 
 
SG-BC then developed a list of list of biodiversity 
research themes that could be addressed by PICES. 
Five themes were identified:  
• Baseline inventories of biodiversity; 
• Understanding and predicting spatial distributions 
of biodiversity; 
• Understanding temporal variation in biodiversity;  
• Assessing vulnerability;  
• Analytical tools for biodiversity conservation.  
 
When cross-referenced against a list of past and 
present PICES activities, it was apparent that 
relatively few PICES expert groups have focused 
research on biodiversity in the North Pacific (Table 2, 
section 1). Given the results of this gap analysis, SG-
BC concluded that establishing a new expert group to 
focus on biodiversity research would complement 
existing PICES activities and address key research 
priorities shared by member countries.   
6.2 Biodiversity research activities that an 
expert group might undertake 
During initial correspondence, SG-BC members 
differed in their perspectives on whether an expert 
group would fulfill a narrow specialized role, or 
serve as an umbrella for a broad diversity of 
biodiversity issues. For instance, some SG-BC  
  
Section 6  Conclusions and Recommendations 
PICES Scientific Report No. 49  29 
members discussed the potential for an expert group 
to model itself after ICES’ Strategic Initiative on 
Biodiversity Advice and Science (SIBAS)
36
 which 
has a key focus on aquatic invasive species, but also 
deals with EBSAs and MPAs. 
 
Alternatively, an expert group focused on biodiversity 
science within PICES could play a similar role to 
ICES’ long-standing Working Group on Deep-water 
Ecology (WGDEC) which has played a valuable role 
in providing scientific advice to the Northeast 
Atlantic Fishery Commission (NEAFC), Northwest 
Atlantic Fishery Organization (NAFO) and the 
OSPAR Commission.  It has filled a niche on science 
issues related to the high seas.  Inter alia, ICES’ 
WGDEC has provided useful analyses and 
approaches to identifying VMEs in the region.  
 
SG-BC recommended that an expert group focused 
on biodiversity research should initially focus on a 
well-defined and narrow scope, and select from one 
or more research themes identified by SG-BC 
member countries as priorities (Table 2, ibid). To 
evaluate the proposed research themes, a list of criteria 
was devised that:  
• Supports research that focuses on one or more 
drivers of biodiversity change; 
• Addresses common knowledge gaps identified in 
the review; 
• Provides clear linkages to PICES expert groups; 
• Provides a new research direction in PICES; 
• Is narrowly focused; 
• Has the potential to develop into a primary 
publication; 
• Is achievable;  
• Has clear applications. 
 
Three ideas were proposed by SG-BC and evaluated 
against these criteria (Table 3, ibid):  
• Develop a plankton/nekton biodiversity network;  
• Develop technical guidance on how to monitor 
biodiversity;  
• Study the diversity and distribution of biogenic 
habitat.  
 
The first proposal was evaluated positively but 
identified as research that could potentially duplicate 
past or present PICES activities, while the second 
was considered to have strong management 
applications but was of lesser scientific interest. The 
                                                 
36
 http://ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/SIBAS.aspx 
third option, researching the diversity and 
distribution of biogenic habitats, was favourably 
reviewed against all evaluation criteria. The results 
of SG-BC’s gap analysis and its proposed topic for a 
new expert group was presented to MEQ, FIS and 
BIO at PICES-2014 and the proposed topic was 
generally supported by all three Committees. BIO 
was identified as the most appropriate parent.  
6.3 Recommendations for a Working Group  
Based on its reviews of research priorities, and past 
and present PICES activities, SG-BC recommends 
the establishment of a Working Group on Biodiversity 
and Biogenic Habitats, with an initial focus on coral- 
and sponge-dominated ecosystems.  The proposed 
Working Group will advance understanding of the 
distribution of coral and sponge taxa in the North 
Pacific Ocean and their contribution to biogenic 
habitats and biodiversity.  This effort represents a 
new emphasis on habitat research for PICES, and the 
initial focus on biogenic habitat could provide a 
proof of concept on how to undertake biodiversity 
research related to other taxa/ecosystems.  Major 
applications of the science products developed by the 
Working Group would be the provision of technical 
guidance on the development and application of 
species distribution models, maps of known and 
predicted distributions of biogenic habitats, and the 
development of biodiversity indicators.  
 
Context  
 
In 2014, PICES convened a 1-year Study Group on 
Biodiversity Conservation (SG-BC).  PICES had no 
formal mechanism to exchange information on issues 
related to biodiversity in the North Pacific despite 
recent requests to do so, for example, from the 
Convention on Biological Diversity in 2013.  Marine 
biodiversity is important for maintaining ecosystem 
structure and function which, in turn, supports 
numerous ecosystem goods and services, including 
sustainable fisheries. 
 
The terms of reference for SG-BC included an 
assessment of the merits of establishing an expert 
group focused on biodiversity science within PICES, 
and providing recommendations on the role of such a 
group.  Through inter-sessional work and its business 
meeting at PICES-2014 (October 18, 2014, Yeosu, 
Korea), attended by members from Canada, Korea, 
and the U.S., and with written submissions from 
Conclusions and Recommendations  Section 6 
30  PICES Scientific Report No. 49 
China and Japan to guide discussions, SG-BC 
identified several opportunities for further 
collaboration on marine biodiversity. Cooperation on 
advancing the understanding of corals and sponges 
as biogenic habitat in the North Pacific was deemed 
particularly timely and appropriate for the work of a 
new PICES Working Group.  
 
Many corals and sponges are known to form fragile 
biogenic habitats.  These three-dimensional features 
provide habitat for numerous fish and invertebrate 
species. They are associated with greater abundance 
of some commercially-targeted species and appear to 
enhance the local biological diversity of many 
ecosystems. Corals and sponges are also strongly 
influenced by biological and physical oceanographic 
processes, and their distribution and biodiversity are 
anticipated to respond to multiple stressors, including 
climate change, pollution, aragonite saturation, and 
fishing. Conservation of these biogenic habitats has 
been identified as a priority in a number of countries 
and international fora. Analyses of the spatial 
distribution and diversity of these taxa and associated 
fauna in the North Pacific have lagged significantly 
behind studies in the North Atlantic.   
 
The merits of this focus include: 
• A new research avenue for PICES with clear 
linkages to PICES activities, particularly BIO and 
WG 28; 
• An opportunity to initially concentrate on 
biogenic habitat that can serve as a model for 
future biodiversity research on other taxa/ 
ecosystems and address a lack of knowledge of 
benthic habitats in deeper waters; 
• New data from at least five PICES member 
countries (Canada, China, Japan, Korea and U.S.) 
that could be integrated to better understand 
factors that influence distribution and trends in 
biogenic habitat diversity, and test key scientific 
questions of broad interest (e.g., model 
transferability); 
• A gathering of knowledge, assessing current 
status, developing indicators to monitor change, 
and hypotheses to forecast responses to multiple 
stressors to align with the spirit of FUTURE. 
Moreover, the key outputs of this Working Group 
(distribution maps, biodiversity indicators) would 
likely be of broad interest outside of PICES; 
• Addressing a targeted ecological question that can 
lead to scientific products within 3 years.  
 
Terms of reference  
  
Year1:  
• Compile data on the distribution of coral and 
sponge taxa, and associated fish and invertebrate 
assemblages in the North Pacific within National

System (OBIS));  
• Compile data on key variables (temperature, 
velocity, ocean acidification, slope, aspect) 
hypothesized to influence coral and sponge 
distribution and diversity and catalogue sources of 
multibeam/swathe bathymetry data for distribution 
modeling within National EEZs;

Report of WG 21 on Non-indigenous Aquatic Species 
 
WG 21 Endnote 3 
Recommendations for future PICES activities on NIS 
 
WG 21 makes the recommendations to Science Board on the following [two] options for continuing activities 
related to marine nonindigenous species: 
 
Option 1 – Create a section focused entirely on marine non-indigenous species 
 
Terms of reference 
 
1. Continue to share information and taxonomic expertise and update the database and atlas on new 
introductions to ecoregions; 
2. Evaluate how changes in patterns of trade affect pathways and vectors, and provide new species pools 
from donor regions (e.g., in the potential opening of a north polar sea route, it is possible that NIS could 
spread between the North Atlantic and North Pacific); 
3. Develop a protocol for sampling non-indigenous aquatic species in PICES member countries, including a 
method for sampling on polar sea route ships; 
4. Develop a better understanding of changing distributions of NIS and vectors in the context of global 
climate change and its impacts on temperature, salinity, ocean acidification and deoxygenation;  
5. Develop capacity for predicting changes in the distribution patterns of selected marine NIS among PICES 
member country ports over the next 100 years as global climate change leads to the opening of new 
pathways (e.g., shipping in the Arctic); 
6. Evaluate the risk of biofouling (hull fouling and tsunami debris) as a vector for the introduction of NIS.  
Additionally, evaluate the individual risks presented by species commonly encountered in biofouling 
vectors; 
7. Investigate why some species establish over broad areas while some only establish restricted distributions.  
Compare widely distributed species (e.g., green crab) with those of the same phyla with a narrow 
distribution. This information could be used in future risk assessments; 
8. Changing vectors (e.g., biofouling ships + tsunami debris (a novel vector) and understanding the risk of 
these species); 
9. Plan workshops/special sessions, for example: 
– Support a joint PICES/ICES Theme Session on “The increasing importance of biofouling for marine 
invasions: an ecosystem altering mechanism” at the 2014 ICES Annual Science Conference in Spain; 
– Propose a workshop/session on mitigation and control measures to reduce the impacts on NIS on the 
marine environment; 
– Propose a workshop session on the role of global climate change in species’ range expansion and 
human-mediated introductions. 
10. Work with NOWPAP and ICES to accomplish the terms of reference; 
11. Work with other PICES expert groups to accomplish the terms of reference; 
12. Prepare a final report on accomplishments. 
 
  
Meeting reports   Appendix 3 
PICES Scientific Report No. 49  41 
Option 2 – Create a Section on Conservation Focused on Drivers of Change in Biodiversity 
 
Terms of Reference 
 
Partnerships: 
• Establish linkages with other intergovernmental organizations dealing with biodiversity issues (e.g., ICES, 
NOWPAP, WESTPAC, NPFC, CBD, FAO) 
• Document and predict patterns in biodiversity: 
– Identify potential mechanisms to store and share information/data on biodiversity issues in the North 
Pacific (and beyond), e.g., PICES atlas on NIS, NPFC SWG to build and update databases of the past 
and current distributions of key commercial and non-commercial species, including database of NIS, at 
the scale of ecoregions. 
– Identify areas that support high, rare, or unique biodiversity, including VMEs and EBSAs in 
collaboration with international organizations including CBD, FAO, NPFC, NOWPAP using 
international criteria (e.g., CBD criteria for EBSA identification; FAO criteria for VME identification). 
 
Understanding drivers of change in biodiversity: 
• Identify major drivers of change in biodiversity in the North Pacific Ocean, including non-indigenous 
marine species, climate change, fishing, and eutrophication, and develop pathways of effects models for 
related activities that describe the mechanisms of change, including interactions among multiple stressors. 
• Develop indicators to assess how drivers and biodiversity are changing over time and space (e.g., 
ecosystem status index). 
• Develop models that relate changes in environmental (e.g., climate-related changes in temperature, salinity, 
pH and O
2
, human (e.g., changes in the distribution of fishing effort, discharge of effluents), and ecological 
variables (e.g., change in community structure) to changes in species distribution patterns, including 
changes in NIS distributions. 
• Develop models and predictions of change in biodiversity under alternative scenarios of climate change, 
NIS introductions, fishing patterns, eutrophication, or other key threats.   
• Investigate impacts of NIS, fishing, climate change, contaminants (and other key threats) in areas that 
support high, rare, unique or endangered biodiversity. 
• Identify how human societies around the North Pacific value marine biodiversity and how they benefit from 
naturally diverse marine ecosystems. 
 
Provision of science advice: 
• Develop risk assessments for areas that support high, rare, unique or endangered biodiversity. 
• Review mechanisms to conserve biodiversity in the North Pacific, including development/implementation 
of Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs), identification of Vulnerable Marine 
Ecosystems (VMEs), Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), etc. and identify mechanisms to preserve 
endangered and threatened species in the North Pacific. 
• Respond to emerging issues related to biodiversity. 
• Prepare science advisory reports on key biodiversity issues. 
• Work with other PICES expert groups to accomplish the Terms of Reference. 
• Prepare a final report on accomplishments.

PICES Twenty-third Annual Meeting (PICES-2014) 
October 17–26, 2014 
Yeosu, Korea 
 
Report of the Study Group on Biodiversity Conservation 
 
 
The Study Group on Biodiversity Conservation (SG-BC) met from 9:00 to 18:00 on October 18, 2014, at 
PICES-2014 in Yeosu, Korea, to review progress on its activities, prepare a set of recommendations for a new 
expert group, and prepare information for its final SG report. SG-BC Chair, Dr. Janelle Curtis, welcomed 
participants to the meeting, and introductions were made (SG-BC Endnote 1). 
 
Dr. Curtis began the meeting with a review (SG-BC Endnote 2) of SG-BC activities and progress to date, a 
review of PICES past and present activities related to biodiversity conservation, and member country 
perspectives on the key drivers of biodiversity change and important knowledge gaps that PICES could 
address. The SG spent the afternoon reviewing the list of drivers of biodiversity change, identifying key 
research questions that could be addressed by a new PICES expert group, and drafted a set of 
recommendations on the roles that such a group would fulfill.  
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 2 
SG-BC activities and progress 
 
Significant progress has been made on all SG-BC terms of reference, and the SG anticipates a final report will 
be submitted to Science Board in January 2015.  
 
1.  Review drivers of biodiversity change: draft review complete 
All SG-BC members drafted summaries of key drivers which were reviewed and summarized in the SG draft 
final report. Key drivers were grouped into six themes: climate change, fishing, pollution, non-indigenous 
species, coastal development, and ecological factors. SG-BC members also noted the importance of 
interactions among multiple drivers (SG-BC Endnote 3, Table 1). The countries where these drivers are 
important were also identified. The driver themes were then cross-referenced with the topics of past and 
present PICES expert groups. While PICES has engaged in relatively little research related to biodiversity, of 
particular note is the lack of PICES expert group focused on the influences of fishing or ecological interactions 
on the spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity.  
 
2.  Identify mechanisms for advancing biodiversity-based research: in progress  
SG-BC members submitted ideas for mechanisms to advance biodiversity research in the North Pacific Ocean, 
as reviewed in the SG draft report. The report will be updated to reflect additional suggestions made during the 
SG-BC meeting, including the development of a basin-wide network of observation and monitoring sites, and 
support of new or existing databases for compiling biodiversity data.  
 
3.  Review biodiversity activities of PICES and other organizations, and 4. Opportunities for collaboration, 
new avenues of research, and provision of science advice 
In addition to discussing the key points of the review in the draft report, the SG cross-referenced its list of 
knowledge gaps and important questions with the biodiversity-related activities, past and present, that PICES 
has already undertaken (SG-BC Endnote 3, Table 2). As noted in the table, the list of knowledge gaps and 
questions submitted by SG-BC members were grouped into five themes, though some questions could be 
grouped with multiple themes. The five themes were: establishing baseline inventories of species and habitats; 
monitoring to understand drivers of temporal trends in biodiversity; analyses to understand and predict spatial 
patterns in species or habitat distributions; vulnerability assessment of species and habitats; quantitative tools 
to support marine spatial planning and ecosystem-based management. Cross-referencing with PICES past and 
Meeting reports   Appendix 3 
PICES Scientific Report No. 49  43 
present activities shows that most knowledge gaps and questions identified by SG-BC have not yet been 
investigated by PICES expert groups. Thus SG-BC agreed there were several opportunities for new avenues of 
research.  
 
5.  Advice to Science Board on merits and roles of a new biodiversity expert group 
In evaluating the merits of establishing a new expert group to focus on biodiversity, SG-BC took into 
consideration the following criteria raised by the SG members:  
 Seeking commonalities among PICES member countries in terms of key knowledge gaps and research 
questions; 
 Maintaining a narrow focus for ensuring efficiency and feasibility;  
 Avoiding duplication in effort by other PICES expert groups; 
 Avoiding duplication in effort by member countries within national waters: thus, consider focus on 
international waters; 
 Developing Terms of Reference and action plan that are achievable with available resources; 
 Aiming for a medium term duration of 2–5 years (e.g., 3-year working group);  
 Application: relevance for supporting management decisions. 
 
Members discussed each theme in terms of developing an expert group to engage in related biodiversity 
research. Several ideas were proposed. Three options for a new biodiversity expert group were identified in 
particular (SG-BC Endnote 3, Table 3): 
1. Establishment of a network of ocean observation sites for characterizing and monitoring changes in the 
distribution, abundance and diversity patterns of indicator species (e.g., microbial communities, plankton, 
and nekton). Patterns in distribution and diversity would be correlated with environmental variables to 
identify key drivers of change and potential predictors. It was noted that the Kurishio Current influences 
the species distributions of five member countries (China, Korea, Japan, Russia and U.S.), and potential 
observation sites were proposed along the current as well as in the northeast Pacific Ocean.  
2. Development of guidance on methods for monitoring changes in marine biodiversity. Guidance could 
address questions related to selection of indicator species, standards for data collection and analysis of 
temporal trends, advice on the distribution and networking of monitoring sites, a standard ecological or 
habitat classification system. This would lay a framework for future PICES research related to assessment 
and monitoring of marine biodiversity in the North Pacific Ocean.  
3. Mapping known and predicted distributions of structure-forming species (or biogenic habitats) throughout 
the North Pacific Ocean, and relating patterns in distribution and diversity to potential drivers of 
biodiversity change. This proposal was viewed as added value in that PICES has not previously focused on 
deepwater benthic habitats/ecosystems or structure forming organisms. The work would be focused, with 
the potential of supporting assessments of vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) led by the North Pacific 
Fisheries Commission (NPFC) or identification of ecologically and biologically significant areas (EBSAs) 
led by Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Structure-forming species were viewed as important 
indicators of biodiversity and of conservation interest. Members also discussed the potential for a working 
group to provide technical guidance to PICES on methods for developing and applying predictive models 
of species distributions, habitats, and biodiversity, and identifying hotspots of biodiversity.  
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 3 
Proposal for a new working group 
 
There was consensus among SG-BC members to develop a proposal to establish a new biodiversity working 
group to focus research on option c, the distribution and diversity of structure-forming species in the deep sea 
waters of the North Pacific Ocean (SG-BC Endnote 4), but to recommend that PICES undertake options a 
and/or b in the future.  
 
In addition SG-BC chairperson invites members to submit the names and affiliations of potential experts for a 
working group focused on biodiversity and distribution of biogenic species/habitats. Such persons could have 
expertise in deep sea ecology, species distribution modelling, biogenic habitats, or other related fields.

Proposal for a new Working Group on Biodiversity of Biogenic Habitats 
 
 
Parent Committee:  BIO   
 
Summary 
 
The Study Group on Biodiversity Conservation (SG-BC) recommends establishment of a Working Group on 
Biodiversity and Biogenic Habitats, with an initial focus on coral- and sponge-dominated ecosystems.  The 
proposed Working Group will advance understanding of the distribution of coral and sponge taxa in the North 
Pacific Ocean and their contribution to biogenic habitats and biodiversity.  This effort represents a new 
emphasis on habitat research for PICES, and the initial focus on biogenic habitat could provide a proof of 
concept on how to undertake biodiversity research related to other taxa/ecosystems.  Major applications of the 
science products developed by the Working Group would be provision of technical guidance on the 
development and application of species distribution models, maps of known and predicted distributions of 
biogenic habitats, and the development of biodiversity indicators.  
 
Context  
 
In 2014, PICES convened a 1-year Study Group on Biodiversity Conservation (SG-BC).  PICES had no formal 
mechanism to exchange information on issues related to biodiversity in the North Pacific despite recent 
requests to do so, for example, from the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2013.  Marine 
biodiversity is important for maintaining ecosystem structure and function, which in turn supports numerous 
ecosystem goods and services, including sustainable fisheries. 
 
The terms of reference for SG-BC included an assessment of the merits of establishing an expert group focused 
on biodiversity science within PICES, and providing recommendations on the role of such a group.  Through 
inter-sessional work and a meeting at PICES-2014 (October 18, 2014, Yeosu, Korea) attended by members 
from Canada, Korea, and the United States and with written submissions from China and Japan to guide 
discussions, SG-BC identified several opportunities for further collaboration on marine biodiversity.  
Cooperation on advancing the understanding of corals and sponges as biogenic habitat in the North Pacific was 
deemed particularly timely and appropriate for the work of a new PICES Working Group.   
 
Many corals and sponges are known to form fragile biogenic habitats.  These three-dimensional features 
provide habitat for numerous fish and invertebrate species. They are associated with greater abundance of 
some commercially-targeted species and appear to enhance the local biological diversity of many ecosystems. 
Corals and sponges are also strongly influenced by biological and physical oceanographic processes, and their 
distribution and biodiversity are anticipated to respond to multiple stressors including global climate change, 
pollution, aragonite saturation, and fishing. Conservation of these biogenic habitats has been identified as a 
priority in a number of countries and international fora. Analyses of the spatial distribution and diversity of 
these taxa and associated fauna in the North Pacific have lagged significantly behind studies in the North 
Atlantic.   
 
The merits of this focus include: 
 A new research avenue for PICES, with clear linkages to PICES activities, particularly BIO, WG 28; 
 An initial focus on biogenic habitat serves as a model for future biodiversity research on other 
taxa/ecosystems and addresses a lack of knowledge of benthic habitats in deeper waters; 
 New data from at least five PICES members countries (Canada, China, Japan, Korea and U.S.) could be 
integrated to not only better understand factors that influence distribution and trends in biogenic habitat 
diversity, but also to test key scientific questions of broad interest (e.g., model transferability). 
 The focus on gathering knowledge, assessing current status, developing indicators to monitor change, and 
hypotheses to forecast responses to multiple stressors is aligned with the spirit of FUTURE. Moreover, the 
Appendix 3  Meeting reports 
48  PICES Scientific Report No. 49 
key outputs of this Working Group (distribution maps, biodiversity indicators) would likely be of broad 
interest outside of PICES. 
 Addressing a targeted ecological question that can lead to scientific products within 3 years.  
 
 
Terms of Reference  
  
Year1:  
 Compile data on the distribution of coral and sponge taxa, and associated fish and invertebrate assemblages 
in the North Pacific within National Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and facilitate their submission to 
appropriate biodiversity databases (e.g., Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS)); 
 Compile data on key variables (temperature, velocity, ocean acidification, slope, aspect) hypothesized to 
influence coral and sponge distribution and diversity and catalogue sources of multibeam/swathe 
bathymetry data for distribution modeling within National EEZs; 
 Hold a WG meeting, in conjunction with the PICES Annual Meeting. 
 
Year 2: 
 Review modeling approaches to predict the potential distributions of species and habitat suitability for 
corals and sponges (e.g., MaxEnt, Boosted Regression Trees, or high resolution bathymetry-based models) 
within National EEZs; 
 Identify environmental and ecological predictors of patterns in the distribution and biodiversity of coral, 
sponge and associated taxa within National EEZs; 
 Convene a session on biogenic habitat distribution and diversity at PICES Annual Meeting; 
 Hold a WG meeting, in conjunction with PICES Annual Meeting. 
 
Year 3: 
 Review and propose potential indicators for assessing and monitoring diversity of biogenic habitats; 
 Review and document associations between commercially important fish and invertebrate species and 
biogenic habitats; 
 Prepare scientific reports for dissemination of results; 
 Hold a WG meeting, in association with the PICES Annual Meeting. 
 
 
Key scientific outputs:   
 
 Technical guidance on development and application of predictive species and habitat modeling approaches 
for deep-sea corals and sponges;  
 Maps of known and predicted distribution and abundance of biogenic habitat (and diversity) in North 
Pacific Ocean; 
 Biodiversity indicators for biogenic habitat assessment and monitoring.

per year appear in dark blue. 
 
Many examples of change in animal distribution, 
abundance, or survival in relationship to local climatic 
factors such as temperature or transport or to large-scale 
regional climate indices were shown.  It was evident from 
maps of where data had been collected in the North Pacific 
Ocean that the open ocean is less well-sampled than the 
shelf regions for all types of physical, chemical and 
biological observations (Fig. 1). For lower trophic level 
species such as phytoplankton and zooplankton, it appears 
that one of the biggest gaps was taxonomic analysis and 
methods for standardization/intercomparison of sampling 
gears.  Recommendations were made for candidate 
indicator species and sensitive measures of change for 
higher trophic level species such as fish, squid, mammals 
and birds.  It was noted that reproductive success is one of 
the most sensitive indicators for these groups. 
 
One of the main purposes of the workshop was to facilitate 
the compilation of data and knowledge of the status and 
trends of North Pacific ecosystem components into a North 
Pacific Ecosystem Status Report.  This concept was 
brought to the attention of the PICES scientific community 
and Governing Council at the 9
th
 Annual Meeting of 
PICES.  A study group is now using the results and 
recommendations from this workshop to refine the concept 
and to determine how to compile such a report.  The 
purpose of the North Pacific Ecosystem Status report is to 
integrate our collective scientific knowledge of the North 
Pacific and its changes and to inform the scientific 
community and policy- and decision-makers in the North 
Pacific region of ecosystem changes and the factors 
influencing change.  Ultimately, the goal is to provide 
predictions of change that can be used to move towards 
ecosystem-based marine policy- and decision-making. 
 
Workshop recommendations mostly dealt with the steps to 
be taken to produce a North Pacific Ecosystem Status 
Report.  Many recommendations made in each of the 
breakout group discussions were specific to each particular 
group.  However, some of the recommendations that were 
discussed in the closing plenary covered all disciplines.  
One main recommendation was to include all the 
information regarding time series data that was identified 
at the workshop into the North Pacific Ecosystem Meta-
database, presently maintained by U.S. researchers Allen 
Macklin and Bernard Megrey.  The meta-database contains 
information about the data, but does not include the data.  
Compiling information on existing time series data will be 
very useful when structuring the Ecosystem Status Report. 
 
Participants recognized the need for PICES member 
nations to pool observational resources to provide a 
complete sampling program in the open ocean areas of the 
North Pacific.  It was also recommended that PICES make 
formal connections with programs that are planning 
coordinated, technologically-advanced observation and 
communication systems, such as the NEPTUNE 
underwater observatory for the northeast Pacific.  A 
variety of technological advancements in monitoring 
efforts from physics to upper-trophic level species were 
recommended as pilot projects for PICES scientists and 
groups to consider in the near future.  These included 
putting instruments on ships-of-opportunity, putting 
biological sensors on buoys, improving sampling 
methodology for small pelagic fishes and video monitoring 
of birds and mammals on continuous plankton recorder 
cruises. 
 
The concept of Regional Analysis Centers (RACs) was 
discussed as a way for PICES to focus the work involved 
in producing an Ecosystem Status Report.  Two ways of 
viewing these centers were mentioned.  One type of RAC 
would be an actual geographic location and building with 
staff assigned to it.  Another type would be more of a 
“virtual” RAC that would rely heavily on a distributed 
network of scientists to contribute to the work.  It seemed 
clear from the organization examples mentioned in 
discussion, that even a “virtual” RAC would still need 
some central support to accomplish the work.   
 
The full report of this workshop is being compiled and is 
scheduled for publication before the PICES 10
th
 
Anniversary Meeting.  The North Pacific Ecosystem Status 
Report and Regional Analysis Center Study Group, formed 
by PICES in 2000, will be considering the 
recommendations and discussions of this workshop in 
order to prepare: 1) a detailed outline for the first Status 
Report, 2) identification of key contributors and data 
sources and how the data would be synthesized into the 
report, 3) estimate costs, and 4) possible role of RACs., e 
for consideration by the PICES scientific community. 
Hopefully, work can begin on compiling the North Pacific 
Ecosystem Status Report after PICES X.

involved in various research projects including the Yellow Sea 
Large Marine Ecosystem.  He was a panel member of IOCCG and 
Coastal-GOOS.  Over the years, Sinjae has been involved with 
PICES, serving on the Biological Oceanography Committee and 
the MODEL Task Team.  His research interests include long-term 
change in primary production and phytoplankton dynamics in 
various marine environments. 
 
 
Background 
 
The Yellow Sea and East China Seas (YS-ECS) are epi-
continental seas (Fig. 1) bounded by the Korean Peninsula, 
mainland China, Taiwan, and some Japanese islands 
(Ryukyu and Kyushu).  Presumably, the YS-ECS 
ecosystems, with dense population living along the coasts, 
are amongst the ecosystems in the Pacific that are under the 
strongest influence of various human activities, such as 
fishing, mariculture, waste discharge, dumping and habitat 
destruction.  There has also been strong evidence showing 
a gradual increase in the water temperature in the past 
decades.  Given the variety of forcing factors, complicated 
changes in the ecosystem are anticipated.  Indeed, rapid 
change and large fluctuations in the species composition 
and abundance in the major fisheries have occurred.  In this 
respect, it was timely that the YS-ECS ecosystem status 
was evaluated as a part of the PICES and Census of Marine 
Life (CoML) efforts of status assessment of the North 
Pacific Ecosystems.  A workshop for this purpose was 
scheduled in April 2003, to gather scientists who have been 
working in this region and to discuss and summarize what 
they learned about the YS-ECS ecosystems during the past.  
Many scientists expressed interests in participating in the 
workshop, however, the workshop was postponed twice 
due to the outbreak of SARS in the spring of 2003.  The 
workshop was finally held October 9, 2003, immediately 
prior to the PICES Twelfth Annual Meeting in Seoul, and 
convened by Drs. Sinjae Yoo and Hyung-Tack Huh 
(KORDI), and Skip McKinnell and Ian Perry (PICES).  A 
draft chapter on the status of YS-ECS ecosystems for the 
PICES North Pacific Ecosystem Status Report (NPESR) 
was written before the workshop based on the contributions 
by Drs. Hiroshi Ichikawa, Xian-Shi Jin, Young-Shil Kang, 
Suam Kim, Jai-Ho Oh, Sinjae Yoo, and Chang-Ik Zhang, 
instead of after the workshop as was originally planned.  
This way, the workshop was more focused on the 
discussion of the draft.

Overview of presentations 
 
About twenty scientists from all PICES member countries 
participated in the workshop.  Since the workshop was 
more focused on revising the draft chapter, presentations 
and discussion were done in a very informal fashion.  Dr. 
Ian Perry (Chairman of PICES Science Board) gave a 
general introduction to the NPESR project.  The objectives, 
structure and target audience of the report were briefly 
explained. 
 
Dr. Sinjae Yoo (Republic of Korea) presented the outline 
of the draft for the YS-ECS chapter.  First, geography, 
topography, circulation, flora and fauna of the region were 
described as background information.  Next, potential 
critical factors causing change in the YS-ECS ecosystems 
were identified:  environmental contamination, 
eutrophication, habitat destruction, overexploitation, and 
changes in the circulation.  In addition to climate-related 
change in the circulation, the building of the Three-Gorges 
Dam in the upper reaches of the Changjiang River could 
bring changes to the ecosystem.  Possible adverse effects 
were pointed out such as a decrease in the primary 
productivity in the vicinity and reduced flushing in the YS.  
Then, details were described for physics, climate and 
chemistry of the region.  There has been an increase of 
1.8ºC in the water temperature in February in the seas 
around Korea during the past one hundred years.  The rate 
of change became greater during the past decade.  The 
nutrient loads into the sea have more than doubled during 
the last two decades.  Data of heavy metals, PCBs, PAHs, 
and other persistent organic pollutants were shown.  
Phytoplankton species composition and primary 
productivity of the region were discussed next.  There seem 
to be still uncertainties in the primary production estimates 
for both the YS and ECS.  It seems interesting that both 
phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass increased in the 
YS since the late 1980’s (Fig. 2).   
 
 
 
Fig. 2 Time series of average annual zooplankton 
biomass (mg/m

) in the eastern Yellow Sea (from 
bi-monthly surveys during 1965-1999, data by Y. 
S. Kang). 
 
Another sign of ecosystem change is the abrupt increase in 
the HAB incidences in Chinese and Korean waters causing 
huge economic damages.  Concurrently with the changes in 
the physics, chemistry and lower trophic level, there have 
been dramatic changes in the higher trophic level in the YS 
and ECS as evidenced by fisheries data in the past three 
decades.  Such changes can be summarized as follows.  
First, declines in biomass and catch of demersal species 
have occurred, and as a result, pelagic species have 
increased in catch proportions, while demersals have 
decreased.  Second, the catch of pelagics species showed 
large fluctuations.  Third, the average trophic level of 
fishery catches has gradually decreased, more rapidly in the 
YS than in the ECS (Fig. 3).  Following fisheries data, a 
brief description was made on the endangered species in 
the YS.

catch of resource organisms in the Yellow Sea 
(data by C.I. Zhang) 
 
After the presentation of the draft outline, talks were given 
for each area ranging from climate and physics to fisheries.  
Dr. Jai-Ho Oh (Republic of Korea) reported on long-term 
changes in the air temperature in Korean cities.  He showed 
that there has been an increase of 0.11~0.23 °C/decade 
since the 1910’s at eight cities.  The number of summer 
days increased by 22, while the number of winter days 
decreased by 27 days, showing a clear trend of warming.  
He also presented projections of future acceleration in the 
temperature rise using the regional climate MM5 model. 
 
The next two presentations were on physical oceanography 
of the region by Drs. Heung-Jae Lie (Republic of Korea) 
and Hiroshi Ichikawa (Japan).  Dr. Lie discussed the 
origins of the Jeju Warm Current and Tsushima Warm 
Current, and seasonality of the coastal currents.  Using 
drifter data, he showed that the Tsushima Current branches 
from Kuroshio along the shelf edge of the ECS.  In the YS, 
strong cyclonic circulation develops along the coasts in 
summer, while in winter, southward currents develop along 
both Chinese and Korean coasts.  Dr. Ichikawa summarized 
the general characteristics and forcing of the regional 
currents.  His talk focused on the inter-annual variation in 
the Changjiang (Yangtze) River discharge and its influence

After presentations on the physics and climate in the 
morning session, talks on chemistry and biology followed 
in the afternoon.  Dr. Jae-Ryoung Oh (Republic of Korea) 
showed results of the pollution surveys in the YS in 2000.  
Heavy metals, and organochlorine compounds including 
pesticides, PCBs and PAHs were analyzed from samples of 
sediments, tissues and liver of fish.  Except for a few 
hotspots, in most of the samples the level of these 
pollutants was below the known safe values.  However, 
there are no criteria for safety for some chemical species 
and continued monitoring is necessary. 
 
Dr. Xian-Shi Jin (People’s Republic of China) presented 
Chinese records of dominant species of phytoplankton, 
zooplankton, and major fisheries species in the YS, ECS 
and Bohai Sea.  The trend of major fisheries species 
composition paralleled that which was observed in the 
Korean waters, e.g., pelagics increased while demersal 
decreased.  As an example of large fluctuations in the 
pelagics, he described the case of Japanese anchovy 
(Engraulis japonicus) which collapsed in the early 2000’s.  
In contrast to the Korean records that showed a doubling 
trend in the zooplankton biomass in the YS since the late 
1980’s, the zooplankton biomass in the Chinese side 
decreased during the same period. 
 
Dr. Ming-Yuan Zhu (People’s Republic of China) 
presented the recent trend in HAB outbreaks in the ECS.  
The most frequent time of the outbreaks was from May to 
June.  There was a dramatic increase in the reported HAB 
outbreaks since 2001, partly due to intensified monitoring 
activities.  He also reported on the oceanographic 
conditions of the outbreaks in 2002.  In 2002, 79 events 
were reported, 55 of which occurred in the ECS and 4 
occurred in the YS.  It was suggested that changes in the 
N/P ratio might be important in the HAB outbreaks. 
 
Investigation, using satellite data, on whether there have 
been real changes in the YS ecosystem over the past two 
decades was the topic of the next presentation by Seung-
Hyun Son (Republic of Korea).  He compared data of two 
ocean color sensors CZCS (Coastal Zone Color Scanner: 
1978~1986) and SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-
view Sensor: 1997~present).  On average, higher 
chlorophyll values were seen in SeaWiFS data.  Likewise, 
water-leaving radiance decreased at 443 nm and increased 
at 555 nm (Fig. 4).  The in-situ data showed less evidence 
of decadal trends, but there were slight increases in 
temperature and zooplankton biomass, and slight decreases 
in salinity and Secchi depth.  
 
Dr. Bernard Megrey (U.S.A.) gave a brief introduction to 
the North Pacific Ecosystem Metadatabase promoted by  
 
NOAA.  He demonstrated the metadatabase webpage and 
asked the audience for future participation.

Discussion 
 
The discussions that followed focused on how to improve 
the draft of the YS-ECS chapter.  The main question was 
“What is missing and whether such information is 
available?”  A number of items were listed including alien 
species, parasites, disease and bacterioplankton.  Data 
might be available for these items but too scanty to be 
representative values.  There are some items such as 
benthos with good data coverage, and certainly should be 
incorporated in the draft.  Also the distribution and 
productivity of commercial invertebrates, and the impact of 
aquaculture on natural communities would be valuable 
information for assessing the ecosystem status.  Fish catch 
data in China as well as in Korea in the draft need to be 
updated as some pelagic fishes show high frequency 
fluctuation.   
 
In addition to the missing data, discrepancies were found 
between datasets.  For example, the zooplankton biomass 
in Korean waters in the YS increased since the late 1980’s, 
while that in Chinese waters decreased in the same period.  
Sampling details should be compared to interpret such 
discrepancy.  This illustrates the need for comparable 
sampling methods and gears in the future.   
 
There were different views about the impact of the Three-
Gorges Dam on the YS-ECS ecosystems:  some think the 
impact would be substantial, while others believe not.  But 
most participants agreed on the need to monitor the future 
change.  Then there was a suggestion that a PICES 
Working Group might be needed for this interesting semi-
natural macrocosm experiment.   
 
The YS and ECS are ecosystems where you can find 
complicated action of multiple forcing factors.  Will we 
ever be able to understand what factors contribute, and how 
much, to the ecosystem change we observe?

Dr. Glen Jamieson is a research scientist at the Pacific Biological Station 
(Fisheries & Oceans Canada) who has 18 years’ experience in shellfish stock 
assessment.  His research and provision of scientific advice is currently centered 
in four general areas:  1) research in support of the establishment of marine 
protected areas (MPAs) and ecosystem-based management in British Columbia; 
2) development of appropriate steward-ship and monitoring protocols;  
3) evaluation of the population dynamics and responses of selected species, 
focusing on relatively sedentary species such as benthic invertebrates, rockfish, 
and lingcod; and 4) investigation and monitoring of the presence and impacts of 
exotic species.  Glen is a member of the PICES MEQ Committee and the 
Chairman of the Study Group on Ecosystem-based management science and its 
application to the North Pacific. 
 
Since the industrial revolution, man’s impact on the oceans 
has increased dramatically, this being especially true in 
recent years.  In near-shore coastal areas, human population 
growth has led to increasing pollution and habitat 
modification.  Fishing effects have become increasingly 
severe, with many, if not most, traditionally harvested 
populations now either fully exploited or over-fished 
(Garcia and Moreno, 2003).  Thus far, management of 
these activities has been primarily sector-focused.  For 
instance, fisheries have generally been managed in 
isolation of the effects of other influencing factors, and 
have targeted commercially important species, without 
explicit consideration of non-commercial species and 
broader ecosystem impacts.  However, there is now an 
increasing international awareness of the cumulative 
impacts of sector-based activities on the ecosystem 
(Jennings and Kaiser, 1998; Kaiser and De Groot, 2000), 
and the need to take a more holistic or ecosystem-based 
management (EBM) approach (Anon., 1999; Kabuta and 
Laane, 2003; Link, 2002) to ensure the sustainability of 
marine ecosystems.  Globally, there is an emerging 
paradigm shift in our approach to ocean management and 
usage (Sinclair and Valdimarsson, 2003). 
 
In response to the increasing awareness to look at 
cumulative environmental impacts, in October 2003, the 
PICES Science Board established, under the direction of 
the Fishery Science (FIS) and Marine Environmental 
Quality (MEQ) Committees, the Study Group on 
Ecosystem-based management science and its application 
to the North Pacific, with the following terms of reference:  
1) Review and describe existing and anticipated 
ecosystem-based management initiatives in PICES 
member nations and the scientific bases for them;  
2) Identify emerging scientific issues related to the 
implementation of ecosystem-based management;  and  
3) Develop recommendations for a Working Group to 
focus on one or more of the issues identified.  
 
The first Study Group task was to reach a common 
understanding of what the terms ecosystem and ecosystem-
based management meant.  The following definitions were 
agreed to: 
 
Ecosystem:  The spatial unit and its organisms and natural 
processes (and cycles) that is being studied or managed. 
 
Ecosystem-based management:  A strategic approach to 
managing human activities that seeks to ensure through 
collaborative stewardship the coexistence of healthy, fully 
functioning ecosystems and human communities [towards 
maintaining long-term system sustainability] by integrating 
ecological, economic, social, institutional and technological 
considerations. 
 
Representatives from each country then submitted a 
summary of their country’s approach to EBM, and it 
became immediately obvious that challenges were different 
between China, Japan and Korea vs. Russia, Canada and 
the United States.  The greater coastal populations in the 
former three countries, coupled with their much longer 
history of full exploitation of most harvestable renewable 
resources, meant that EBM was, initially at least, focused 
on 1) minimising existing impacts, 2) rebuilding depleted 
stocks to more acceptable levels, and 3) in near-shore areas 
in particular, minimising widespread impacts in the marine 
environment from land runoff from both industrial and 
urban developments.  In contrast, in the latter three 
countries, human coastal populations and development 
were generally much less, with fishing impacts and 
offshore oil and gas development identified as the major 
Appendix 4  PICES Press Articles 
56  PICES Scientific Report No. 49 
impacts.  In many instances, relatively unimpacted, pristine 
habitat and biological communities still existed, and so the 
challenges there were often how to maintain them while 
permitting appropriate new economic activity to occur. 
 
When the Study Group met at PICES XIII (Honolulu, 
October 2004), there was much discussion around three 
issues:   
1) What would be an appropriate standard format to 
document environmental impacts and initiatives to 
minimise them;   
2) How could the PICES region be subdivided into what 
the Study Group termed eco-regions;  and  
3) What indicators would be most appropriate to evaluate 
progress in achieving EBM.  
 
While it is recognised that many human activities impact 
the marine environment (e.g., fishing, mariculture, oil and 
gas exploration and development, pollution from land-
based activities, disruption of freshwater discharges by 
urbanisation, etc.), the most comprehensive databases (e.g., 
target species landings, bycatch and discard characteristics, 
habitat disruption, etc.) as to how these impacts are 
affecting marine ecosystems are related to fishing 
activities.  Hence, much initial reporting of ecosystem 
impacts is likely to be focused on documenting and 
addressing fishery impacts.  Alternate reporting formats 
may need to be assessed or developed that capture the 
ecosystem effects resulting from other human activities, 
and that describe how these ecosystem effects are being 
monitored.  Ecosystem parameters already, or potentially, 
being monitored may capture environmental change, 
without linking this change back to the specific human 
activity, or activities, that in fact might be causing the 
change (e.g. increasing sea water temperature may be the 
result of many causes, some of which relate to human 
activities).  In some cases, additional research may then be 
required to determine linkages.  It was thus proposed by the 
Study Group that a standardised reporting framework that 
describes human activity impacts be progressively applied 
to all fisheries in PICES member countries, and that the 
adopted reporting framework be robust enough to address 
an increasing number of environmental and other 
requirements imposed by legislation, certification schemes, 
and consumer and community demands.  
 
Eco-regions have been defined by Canada as “a part of a 
larger marine area (eco-province) characterized by 
continental shelf-scale regions that reflect regional 
variations in salinity, marine flora and fauna, and 
productivity”.  Biological communities between each 
region are somewhat different, but within a region, they are 
generally similar, at least on the large scale.  There would 
obviously be differences between habitats (e.g., estuarine, 
rocky, soft substrate, etc.) within an eco-region, but overall, 
the same mix of species could be expected to occur.  EBM 
approaches within an eco-region should thus strive to 
achieve the same broad conceptual objectives of trying to 
preserve the natural species mix, proportions across trophic 
levels, water quality, and so on.  Since some eco-regions 
might transgress national boundaries, this might mean that 
different countries would be trying to address the same 
ecological objectives in their own waters within the same 
eco-region.  The Study Group thus indicated that it would 
be of value to have a collective evaluation of where 
different eco-region boundaries are located. 
 
It was generally agreed that while achievement of EBM 
was a common objective, only through monitoring could 
the level of progress be actually measured.  For cost-
effectiveness, existing monitored parameters should be first 
assessed as to their utility here, but it was recognised that 
new parameters, many associated with non-commercial 
species, will also have to be monitored.  Different national 
approaches to achieving such monitoring were briefly 
discussed, mostly in the context of initiatives to develop a 
process to determine an optimal mix of parameters to 
monitor. 
 
In finalising its report, the Study Group made the 
recommendation to its two parent Committees, FIS and 
MEQ, to establish a Working Group on Ecosystem-based 
management, with a 3-year duration and the following 
terms of reference: 
 
 Describe and implement a standard reporting format 
for EBM initiatives (including more than fishery 
management) in each PICES country, including a 
listing of the ecosystem-based management 
objectives of each country;  
 Describe relevant national marine ecosystem 
monitoring approaches and plans and types of models 
for predicting human and environmental influences 
on ecosystems.  Identify key information gaps and 
research and implementation challenges;  
 Evaluate the indicators from the 2004 Symposium on 
“Quantitative Ecosystem Indicators for Fisheries 
Management” for usefulness and application to the 
North Pacific;  
 Review existing definitions of “eco-regions” and 
identify criteria that could be used for defining 
ecological boundaries relevant to PICES; 
 Hold an inter-sessional workshop that addresses the 
status and progress of EBM science efforts in the 
PICES region, with the deliverable being either a 
special journal issue or a review article;  and  
 Recommend to PICES further issues and activities 
that address the achievement of EBM in the Pacific. 
 
The parent Committees and Science Board accepted these 
recommendations, and the proposed Working Group on 
Ecosystem-based management science and its application 
to the North Pacific was established in October 2004.  The 
Science Board also suggested that the full report of the 
Study Group be published as soon as possible in the PICES 
Scientific Report Series.

PICES participates in a Convention on Biological Diversity Regional Workshop 
 
by Thomas Therriault 
 
The United Nations, through the Convention on Biological 
Diversity (CBD), is in the process of identifying/describing 
ecologically or biologically significant marine areas 
(EBSAs) around the world using a series of regional 
workshops.  Scientific criteria agreed to by the Conference 
of the Parties (COP) to the Convention form the basis to 
describe the EBSAs (see Annex 1 of COP decision IX/20) 
and include: productivity, biodiversity, important areas for 
threatened and endangered species, life history criteria 
required for species to survive and thrive, unique and rare 
features, vulnerability and fragility, and naturalness.  
Identification of any area as an EBSA is a scientific process 
recognising and describing its importance to the ecological 
and/or biological defining criteria – the next step in the 
process (yet to be taken) is to discuss and identify any 
special management measures that may be recommended 
for any particular EBSA.  A regional workshop for the 
North Pacific was held from February 25 to March 1, 2013, 
in Moscow, Russia.  As a recognized organization with 
significant knowledge of the North Pacific, PICES was 
asked to officially nominate an expert to participate in this 
workshop.  It was anticipated that PICES involvement 
would increase the awareness of the CBD and its EBSA 
process within PICES, assist in the nomination of relevant 
experts through PICES’ scientific networks, help CBD 
identify other relevant organizations to be invited, facilitate 
the use of workshop products in future marine biodiversity 
conservation efforts in the North Pacific to ensure 
sustainable use, and work with the CBD Secretariat to 
conduct the workshop.  The author of this article was 
nominated and served on the steering committee for this 
regional workshop and as rapporteur for one of the major 
elements of the final workshop report that will be posted on 
the CBD website. 
 
The first day of the workshop focused on several housekeeping 
issues.  The introductions identified participants from several 
member countries, including Canada, Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea, Japan, Mexico, Philippines, Republic of 
Korea, and Russian Federation (see the group photo, Fig. 1).  
The People’s Republic of China had confirmed participation 
but visa difficulties precluded their involvement in 
Moscow.  In addition, a representative from the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United 
States and several international organizations, including 
NOWPAP, NPAFC, and PICES participated in the 
workshop.  Workshop discussions and analyses were 
supported by a technical team from Duke University, USA. 
 
Following UN procedures, Dr. Alexander Shestakov 
(Director, WWF Global Arctic Programme) and Dr. Jake 
Rice (Chief Scientist, Fisheries and Oceans Canada) were 
identified as workshop co-chairs.  In addition, rapporteurs 
were selected for each of the major sections of the 
workshop report.  Each international organization was then 
invited to provide a presentation to workshop participants.

Fig. 2 Dr. Therriault provides an overview of PICES to workshop 
participants. 
 
Dr. Therriault described the mandate and structure of 
PICES, efforts of its expert groups, and products (e.g., 
North Pacific Ecosystem Status Reports) that would be of 
value to this CBD process, and an overview of the PICES 
FUTURE program (Fig. 2).  This was followed by country 
presentations of national processes which apply EBSA 
criteria or similar national processes.  The first day also 
included a review of the criteria that would be used to 
identify EBSAs for the North Pacific and the scope that 
workshop participants would consider.  All countries other  
than Mexico and the Russian Federation requested that 
their national waters not be included in this meeting for 
identification of EBSAs, mostly because of national 
processes already underway.  The workshop participants 
agreed on the following scope for the workshop: marine 
areas within national jurisdiction of Mexico and the 
Russian Federation, marine areas beyond national 
jurisdictions in this region, the northern limit identified at 
the Western South Pacific regional workshop on EBSAs, 
the northeastern tropical Pacific area, and the Bering Strait, 
including the Russian coastal area and “Donut Hole” in the 
Bering Sea, but excluding the marine areas within the 
national jurisdiction of the USA. 
 
Following a preliminary scoping exercise on the start of 
Day 2, workshop participants spent the next three days 
identifying EBSAs in the North Pacific using the CBD 
criteria, including compiling the necessary supporting 
documentation.  By the end of the workshop, participants 
had agreed upon 20 EBSA units (Table 1) that will be 
tabled for discussion at the next meeting of COP (winter 
2013 or early 2014).  The report from the meeting is 
expected to be available soon on CBD’s website.

workshop.  Polygons in red indicate those areas described against EBSA criteria by the workshop.  Polygons in orange indicate those features that are 
inherently not spatially fixed, and described against EBSA criteria by the workshop. 
 
 
There was debate at the workshop about whether the eastern 
and western North Pacific gyres should be included as 
potential EBSAs, considering their importance for salmon 
populations.  However, not enough information was available 
at the meeting to support including these regions as EBSAs 
at this time but participants recommended these regions 
should receive further consideration in future CBD processes.  
It is worth highlighting the area of the North Pacific 
Transition Zone (EBSA Number 19 identified by the large 
orange polygon in Fig. 3) is extraordinarily large for an 
EBSA, and was defined primarily on the basis of the 
northerly and southerly seasonal migrations of the Transition 
Zone chlorophyll frontal zone.  The narrative describing 
this region notes that this is not a geographically fixed 
feature but one which is seasonally variable in its location.  
This is in contrast to the bathymetrically-fixed EBSAs 
proposed about the various seamount chains in the North 
Pacific. 
PICES has considerable experience with identifying and 
describing ecologically and biologically important areas in 
the North Pacific, although it has not (yet) used the CBD 
EBSA terminology and criteria.  Some examples include 
the two North Pacific Ecosystem Status Reports, topic 
sessions at PICES Annual Meetings (most recently in 
Portland in 2010), and WG 19’s efforts on ecosystem-
based management.  The ever increasing international 
interest in EBSAs and current and planned global efforts to 
identify such areas both within and beyond country 
Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) represent an important 
opportunity for PICES.  As an intergovernmental 
organization we have a wealth of science experts to 
consider these issues and to provide scientifically 
defensible recommendations not only for EBSAs but for 
other international initiatives currently underway in the 
North Pacific (e.g., World Ocean Assessment; see page 12 
in this issue).

Workshop on Marine Biodiversity Conservation and Marine Protected Areas  
in the Northwest Pacific 
 
by Vladimir Kulik

Pacific”, March 13–14, 2013, in Toyama, Japan.  The photo was provided by the Special Monitoring and Coastal Environmental Assessment 
Regional Activity Centre (CEARAC) of NOWPAP. 
 
The beautiful city of Toyama, Japan, 300 km northeast of 
Tokyo, was the setting on March 13–14, 2013, for a workshop 
on “Marine biodiversity conservation and marine protected 
areas in the Northwest Pacific”.  The workshop was 
convened by NOWPAP (Action Plan for the Protection, 
Management and Development of the Marine and Coastal 
Environment of the Northwest Pacific Region; part of the 
Regional Seas Program of the United Nations Environment 
Program; http://www.nowpap.org/) and NEASPEC (North-
east Asian Sub-program for Environmental Cooperation; 
http://www.neaspec.org/).  The objectives of the workshop 
were: (1) to share information on methodologies for marine 
environment assessment and the current status of Marine 
Protected Areas (MPAs) in member states of NOWPAP, 
and (2) to discuss the programs and operations of the 
proposed North-east Asian MPA network.  PICES was 
invited to participate in this workshop, and was represented 
by Dr. Vladimir Kulik, a member of the PICES Working 
Group 28 on Development of Ecosystem Indicators to 
Characterize Ecosystem Responses to Multiple Stressors.  
In addition to PICES, other participants at the workshop 
included experts from all NOWPAP member states (Japan, 
People’s Republic of China, Republic of Korea and the Russian 
Federation) and from international organizations such as 
the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM; http://www.helcom.fi/) 
and the IOC Sub-Commission for the Western Pacific 
(IOC/WESTPAC; http://www.unescobkk.org/westpac).  In 
total, more than 20 people attended the workshop (Fig. 1). 
 
The motivation for the workshop was responsibilities to 
contribute to marine biodiversity conservation and sustainable 
use of marine ecosystem services in the NOWPAP region.  
The meeting had presentations and shared information on 
details of MPAs in the region, including definition, categories 
and monitoring/management status in each member state of 
NOWPAP.  An information sheet was developed and will 
be finalized based on additional information provided after 
the workshop.  The meeting discussed the similarities and 
differences in the definitions of MPAs among the member 
states and recognized the usefulness of such information 
for future considerations to improve the management of 
MPAs.  Information was also shared on the challenges of 
PICES Press Articles  Appendix 4 
PICES Scientific Report No. 49  61 
maintaining and managing MPAs, as well as future plans to 
design and expand these areas, including the possible 
application of the Ecologically or Biologically Significant 
Sea Area (EBSA) concept developed by the United Nations 
(UN) Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD; 
http://www.cbd.int) and other organizations. 
 
The meeting learned about ongoing related activities for 
assessing the marine environment being conducted by 
PICES, HELCOM and IOC/WESTPAC, which were 
recognized as being useful for the conservation of marine 
biodiversity in the NOWPAP region.  The necessity of 
Ecological Quality Objectives for the NOWPAP region 
was stressed as a basis for setting targets for assessment 
and appropriate management.  Collaborations among the 
NOWPAP member states and other regional organizations 
such as PICES towards the conservation of marine 
biodiversity were acknowledged as being crucial.  Of 
special interest to PICES was a presentation by Dr. Maria 
Laamanenof (HELCOM) on “Comprehensive ecosystem 
assessment for marine biodiversity conservation”.  She 
noted that they have reached the 10 % target set by the UN 
CBD for a regional network of MPAs in the Baltic Sea.  
However, the present network may not be entirely 
ecologically coherent if adequacy, representativity, 
replication and connectivity are the primary criteria used 
for its assessment.  The most important problems they have 
encountered in evaluating the effectiveness of this network 
of MPAs are nonlinearities and thresholds in the ecosystem 
recovery process.  Therefore, reaching some of the targets 
did not lead to convergence with other targets from the 
same domain.  As a result, widely used simplifications in 
the models of ecosystem assessment such as linearity and 
additivity must be reconsidered.  HELCOM member states 
are in the process of summarizing their achievements in 
assessing the progress towards reaching HELCOM 
objectives for a healthy Baltic Sea, which are available at 
http://www.helcom.fi/BSAP_assessment/en_GB/main. 
At its conclusion, the NOWPAP/NEASPEC workshop 
recommended the following: 
 The regional monitoring centre for NOWPAP to assess 
the availability of data and to consider the collection of 
metadata and the development of assessment tools 
based on the available data for marine biodiversity 
conservation in the NOWPAP region; 
 Recognizing that the indicators employed by HELCOM 
and those being studied by PICES are useful references 
for the NOWPAP region, to consider the availability of 
data and different conditions in the marine environment 
in the NOWPAP region when selecting indicators; 
 Strengthen collaboration with relevant partners, for 
example, PICES, HELCOM and IOC/WESTPAC, 
when conducting the above tasks.
