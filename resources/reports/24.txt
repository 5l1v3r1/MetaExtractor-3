Executive Summary 
 
The North Pacific Ocean plays a significant role in controlling the long-term fate of CO
2
 on Earth.  Much 
of our understanding of the distribution of anthropogenic CO
2
 in the North Pacific stems from intensive 
work conducted during the decade of the 1990s.  Underway measurements were made for pCO
2
 in the 
northern North Pacific from 1995 to 1999, as part of the Japan-Canada cooperative vessel-of-opportunity 
program.  In addition, discrete high-quality dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity data were 
acquired as part of the WOCE/JGOFS Global CO
2
 survey in the Pacific Ocean between 1991 and 1999.  
This research was supported, in part, by the member nations of the North Pacific Marine Science 
Organization (PICES).  This report describes the research and technical activities of the PICES Working 
Group 13 on CO
2
 in the North Pacific from 1998 through 2001.  The major scientific objectives of the 
Working Group were to:  (i) synthesize CO
2
 data from the North Pacific Ocean;  (ii) determine the 
sources and sink for CO
2
 and their regional fluxes;  and (iii) provide a comprehensive picture of the 
distribution of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the region.  The major technical activities included:  (i) 
supporting international cooperation in exchanges of samples from cruises;  (ii) organizing measurement 
inter-comparison studies for carbonate parameters in seawater;  and (iii) developing ongoing mechanisms 
for exchanging data at the international level;  and (iv) sponsoring several meetings and symposia on CO
2
 
system dynamics in the North Pacific.  We will discuss the implications of these research and technical 
activities with respect to climate change processes and provide recommendations for future directions by 
PICES for international cooperation on carbon cycle research in the North Pacific.

1.0 Introduction 
 
Over the past 200 years, human activities have 
led to a secular increase in atmospheric CO
2 
from about 280 to greater than 365 ppmv 
(Keeling and Whorf, 2000; Carbon Dioxide 
Information Analysis Center, 2001).  The impact 
of the CO
2
 increase and that of other 
“greenhouse” gases on the global climate is at 
the center of a major international policy debate.  
Studies of the ocean’s role in the uptake and 
storage of anthropogenic CO
2
 and modulation of 
future atmospheric CO
2
 levels are critical for 
understanding the global carbon cycle and for 
the prediction of future climate change.  The 
North Pacific is an important sink region for 
atmospheric carbon dioxide in the oceans and, 
consequently, plays a significant role in 
controlling the long-term fate of CO
2
 on Earth.  
Some biogeochemical processes relating to the 
oceanic CO
2
 system are peculiar to the North 
Pacific.  This occurs because (i) the North 
Pacific is the final destination of circulation of 
the deep water that contains a high level of 
preformed nutrients and dissolved inorganic 
carbon (DIC), and (ii) the North Pacific 
Intermediate Water stores dissolved CO
2
 for 
more than a few tens of years.   
 
Much of our understanding of the distribution 
and fate of anthropogenic CO
2
 in the North 
Pacific stems from the high-quality carbon data 
that were acquired as part of the World Ocean 
Circulation Experiment (WOCE)/Joint Global 
Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Global CO
2
 survey 
and subsequent cruises.  In addition, underway 
measurements were made for pCO
2
 in the 
northern North Pacific from 1995 to 1999, as 
part of the Japan-Canada cooperative vessel of 
opportunity program.  This research was 
supported, in part, by the member nations of the 
North Pacific Marine Science Organization 
(PICES), through the activities of its Working 
Group 13. The group played a major role in 
fostering international cooperation in exchanges 
of samples from cruises, supporting CO
2
 inter-
comparison studies, and developing strategies 
for exchanging data at the international level.  
This report summarizes the research and 
technical activities that have been conducted by 
member nations of PICES to synthesize CO
2
 
data in the North Pacific, and provide a 
comprehensive picture of the distribution of 
anthropogenic CO
2
 in this region.  Then, the 
implications of the results with respect to 
climate change processes in the future are 
discussed.  Finally, recommendations are made 
for future directions by PICES for international 
cooperation on carbon cycle research in the 
North Pacific. 
  
 
  
2.0 Synthesis of the WOCE/JGOFS global CO
2
 survey data in the North Pacific 
 
The recently completed WOCE/JGOFS global 
CO
2
 survey conducted during the 1990s 
produced over 15 times more high-quality 
carbon measurements than previous survey 
efforts.  These data are an important asset to the 
scientific community investigating 
biogeochemical cycling of carbon species in the 
oceans.  They are also a significant legacy to 
future generations of scientists by providing a 
baseline against which future changes in ocean 
geochemistry can be assessed.  Most of the data 
have been reported to national archive facilities.  
Between 1991 and 1999, carbon system 
measurements were made on 14 WOCE/JGOFS 
cruises in the North Pacific Ocean by 
investigators from 9 different laboratories and 3 
countries (Fig. 1, Table 1).  At least two of the 
four inorganic carbon parameters were analyzed 
on each cruise, with the exception of CGC91 
and P9.  DIC was measured on all of the cruises, 
but additional measurements included one or 
more of the remaining parameters:  TAlk, 
fugacity of CO
2
 ( fCO
2
1
), or pH.  With support 
from PICES and several federal agencies at the 
national level, an analysis of this data set was 
conducted in order to make specific 
recommendations for the adjustment of the 
Pacific carbon survey data to produce a 
uniformly calibrated data set. 
 
2.1 Analytical methods 
 
Analyses of all carbon parameters during the 
Pacific Ocean CO
2
 survey cruises were 
generally performed following the techniques 
outlined in the Handbook of methods for the 
analysis of the various parameters of the carbon 
dioxide system in seawater (DOE, 1994). 
 
2.1.1 Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) 
analysis 
 
All DIC samples were analyzed by coulometric 
titration.  The main differences between the 
various groups were the sample volume and the 
primary calibration method (Johnson, 1992; 
Johnson et al., 1985,  1987,  1993,  1998, Ishii et

 The fugacity of CO
2
 takes into account the non-ideal nature of the gas.  The values of fCO
2
 are within 
0.5-1.5 µatm of the partial pressure of CO
2
 in surface waters.

al., 1998).  Certified Reference Materials 
(CRMs) (UNESCO, 1991; Dickson, 1992; 
Dickson et al., 2003a, b) were used on most 
cruises as secondary standards for DIC.  
Certification of the CRM DIC is based on the 
vacuum extraction/manometric analysis of C. D. 
Keeling at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography (UNESCO, 1991; Guenther et 
al., 1994).  Routine shipboard CRM analyses 
helped verify sample measurement accuracy.  
Some laboratories reporting their DIC data to the 
archived data location did not normalize to 
CRMs. 
2.1.2 Total alkalinity (TAlk) analysis 
 
All shipboard TAlk measurements were made 
by potentiometric titration using a computer-
controlled Dosimat™ titrator and a pH meter 
(Brewer et al., 1986, Millero et al., 1993, DOE 
1994, Ono et al., 1998).  The primary analytical 
differences were the volume of sample analyzed, 
the use of either an open or closed titration cell, 
the method for fitting the titration results (i.e. 
Gran, nonlinear fit, or single point titration), and 
the calibration methods.  Most groups routinely 
running CRMs for DIC also analyzed the CRMs 
  
for TAlk despite the fact that the CRMs were not 
certified for TAlk until July 1996.  Batches of 
CRMs bottled prior to July 1996 were certified 
by analyzing archived samples.  This allowed 
post-cruise corrections to be made on many of 
the shipboard measurements (Lamb et al., 2002). 
 
2.1.3 Discrete fCO
2
 analysis 
 
Each aliquot of seawater was equilibrated at a 
constant temperature of either 4°C or 20°C with 
a headspace of known initial CO
2
 content.  
Subsequently, the headspace CO
2
 concentration 
was determined by non-dispersive infrared 
analyzer (NDIR) or by gas chromatography.  
The initial fCO
2
 in the water was determined 
after correcting for loss or gain of CO
2
 during 
the equilibration process.  This correction can be 
significant for large initial fCO
2
 differences 
between headspace and water, and for systems 
with a large headspace to water volume ratio 
(Wanninkhof and Thoning, 1993; Chen et al., 
1995). 
 
2.1.4 pH analysis 
 
With the exception of the potentiometric method 
of pH analysis used on P2, all the North Pacific 
samples were analyzed by a spectrophotometric 
method (Clayton and Byrne, 1993), with m-
cresol purple as the indicator and either scanning 
or diode array spectrophotometers, and were 
measured at 25°C, with no conversion made to 
in situ temperatures.  Since the precision of 
potentiometric pH is often no better than 0.02 
pH units (SCOR, 1985), we have used only 
crossover data in this report that was analyzed 
spectrophotometrically. 
 
All of the pH values were initially reported on 
the total hydrogen scale, and were then 
converted to the seawater scale (pH
SWS
) to be 
consistent with published dissociation constants 
of carbonic acid.  The seawater scale considers 
the interaction of hydrogen ions with bisulfate 
and fluoride ions in seawater, while the total 
scale only includes the bisulfate contribution 
(Dickson and Riley, 1979; Dickson and Millero, 
1987).  The two scales are linked by the 
following equation: 
pH
SWS

where pH
T
 is the hydrogen ion concentration on 
the total hydrogen scale, [F

]
T 
and
 
[SO

T
 are 
the total concentrations of fluoride and sulphate 
in seawater, and K
HF
 and K
HSO4
 
are the 
dissociation constants of hydrogen fluoride and 
sulphate in seawater (Dickson and Riley, 1979).  
 
2.2 Crossover comparisons of global 
CO
2
 survey data 
 
The goal of the crossover comparisons was to 
produce an accurate data set that was consistent 
between cruises.  Despite greatly improved 
analytical techniques, the use of primary and 
secondary standards, and shore-based analysis of 
replicate samples for verification of accuracy for 
some carbon parameters, a few of the cruises 
still appear to have offsets when compared with 
other cruises in the same area.  One approach for 
evaluating the consistency of the cruises was to 
compare data where cruises crossed or 
overlapped (Lamb et al., 2002).  A location was 
considered a crossover if stations from two 
cruises were within ~100 km of each other.  If 
more than one station from a particular cruise 
fell within the 100 km limit, the data were 
combined for the comparison.  Table 2 provides 
a summary of the crossovers in the North 
Pacific.  The crossover analysis is based on the 
assumption that the deep waters of the Pacific 
Ocean were constant within the 9 years of this 
study.  The residence time of Pacific Deep 
Water is ~500 years (Stuiver et al., 1983), 
therefore, we can assume that these waters do 
not change significantly between cruises. For 
this analysis, only deep-water (>2,000 m) 
measurements were considered, because shallow 
water concentrations are highly variable and the 
penetration of anthropogenic CO
2
 could 
potentially change relationships between the 
carbon parameters measured at different times.

Sixteen crossover locations were identified for 
analysis of DIC data.  Only 9 locations had 
measured TAlk values for comparison.  An 
additional 2 crossover locations were possible 
by comparing measured TAlk on one cruise to 
calculated TAlk values from another cruise.  The 
calculated values were based on the combination 
of pH-DIC or fCO
2
-DIC using the carbonate 
constants of Mehrbach et al. (1973) as refit by 
Dickson and Millero (1987), and ancillary 
constants (e.g., boric acid and nutrients) based 
on DOE (1994) and Millero (1995).  Just 3 
crossover locations were available for fCO
2
, and 
only 1 crossover could be used to examine the 
consistency of the pH data.  Due to the problems 
associated with fCO
2
 comparisons, and because 
of the paucity of pH crossover locations 
available, no additional statistical analyses were 
performed on either of these parameters.   
 
Comparisons between two cruises at the 
crossover locations were made by fitting the data 
from each cruise with a 2
nd
 order polynomial 
function, and examining the differences (deltas) 
between the two curve fits.  Potential density 
referenced to 3,000 dbar ( σ
3
), rather than depth, 
was chosen as the independent variable for the 
analysis because water primarily moves along 
isopycnal surfaces.  The average difference and 
standard deviation were determined from 
differences at 10 evenly spaced intervals along 
the curves.  The number of points and their 
spread can affect the quality of the polynomial 
fits over the range.  Differences in the number or 
distribution of points were notable in less than 
10% of the DIC and TAlk comparisons 
examined. 
 
Inspection of the polynomial residuals showed 
that the 2
nd
 order function was inadequate for 
about 15% of the DIC and TAlk fits.  In some 
cases, the residual patterns suggested that 
several different water masses were being 
examined.  This occurred in areas of the North 
Pacific Ocean that have a complex vertical 
structure because of influences from the North 
Pacific Intermediate water and Pacific Deep 
Water.  However, since we were more interested 
in the offsets than the nature of the curves, we 
maintained the 2
nd
 order model to allow a 
uniform treatment of the crossover data while 
fitting a small number of parameters to the 
sometimes-limited deep-water (>2,000 m) data 
at each crossover. 
 
To ensure that sparse sampling combined with 
either noisy data or variability resulting from 
water mass variations was not significantly 
biasing the estimates of the offsets, several 
approaches were examined.  These include:  
same shape polynomial fits, multi-parameter 
linear regression (MLR) at crossover locations, 
basin-wide MLRs, isopycnal analyses, and 
internal consistency checks (Lamb et al. 2002).  
The overarching goal of this work was to assess 
the quality of the Pacific carbon survey data and 
to make recommendations for generating a 
unified data set that is both as accurate as 
possible, as well as consistent between cruises.  
To develop such a data set, some adjustments 
are necessary.  Two important points must be 
considered when evaluating the various 
approaches used to examine the data quality of 
the cruises.  First, most of the approaches 
assume that the deep ocean does not change over 
the time-period of the various cruises.  As noted 
previously, the residence time for Pacific Deep 
Water is ~500 years (Stuiver et al., 1983), 
almost two orders of magnitude longer than the 
difference in time between cruises.  Thus, very 
little variability would be expected in the deep 
waters (pressure >2,000 dbar) at the crossover 
points.  As a direct check on the constancy of the 
deep waters, DIC variability was examined as a 
function of latitude on deep isopycnal surfaces 
(Lamb et al., 2002).  The trend of increasing 
values from south to north results from re-
mineralization of organic matter and dissolution 
of calcium carbonate in the waters as they 
spread northward from 20° to 40°N.  Variability 
in these waters can be evaluated from the 
residuals of a linear fit of the large-scale trend.  
The residuals for points linearly interpolated 
onto the 41.5 σ
3 
surface have a standard 
deviation of ±2.5 µmol kg
-1
.  If the vertical 
interpolation is determined by fitting the deep 
  
data with a second order polynomial, such as 
that used in the crossover analysis, the standard 
deviation of the residuals drops to  ±1.5 µmol 
kg
-1
.  This variability includes the effects of 
mesoscale features, temporal variations in 
preformed concentrations and analytical 
uncertainty.  The combined effects of these are 
notably smaller than the estimated offsets on 
several of the cruises.  Second, the various 
approaches have different strengths and 
weaknesses and may be more or less reliable in 
different oceanographic regions.  Furthermore, 
the calculated offsets and associated errors may 
not be directly comparable.  As a result, some 
level of subjectivity is necessarily a part of the 
adjustments proposed in this section.  We have 
made every attempt to consider all of the various 
lines of evidence available.  Adjustments were 
based on a preponderance of evidence and only 
implemented when we felt an adjustment was 
clearly necessary.  Through consultation with 
the principle investigators involved in the 
Pacific survey, we feel that the adjustments 
proposed here are the best possible with our 
present understanding of the data quality.  
 
The limited number of crossovers available for 
pH implies that the spectrophotometric 
measurements were very precise and consistent 
between cruises.  DeValls and Dickson (1998) 
have suggested, however, that the pH values 
initially assigned to the “tris”-buffers used to 
characterize the indicator, m-cresol purple, 
should be increased by 0.0047.  This revision 
would translate into a comparable increase in the 
pH
T
 values reported for the Pacific (Lamb et al., 
2002). 
Table 3 summarizes our recommended 
adjustments for the DIC, TAlk and pH data from 
the North Pacific CO
2
 survey cruises.  Given the 
long timeframe over which the North Pacific 
survey was conducted, and the number of 
analytical groups and systems used to measure 
carbon in the Pacific, a thorough investigation 
into the quality and consistency of the data was a 
difficult task.  Although we have done a careful 
analysis using several techniques, there is still a 
certain amount of subjectivity involved when 
recommending adjustments.  Certainly, all 
available lines of evidence have contributed to a 
better understanding of the consistency of the 
North Pacific data set, and together have proven 
to be an invaluable tool for determining any 
necessary adjustments. 
 
With the adjustments proposed in Table 3, the 
examined cruises can be combined to generate a 
North Pacific Ocean data set with over 14,000 
unique sample locations analyzed for at least 
two carbon parameters, with the exception of P9 
and CGC91.  The overall accuracy of the DIC 
data was ~5 µmol kg
-1
.  TAlk, the second most 
common carbon parameter analyzed, had an 
overall accuracy of ~10 µmol kg
-1
.  The TAlk 
was calculated for all cruises where it was not 
measured using the carbonate dissociation 
constants of Mehrbach et al. (1973) as refitted 
by Dickson and Millero (1987), and ancillary 
constants listed in the program of Lewis and 
Wallace (1998).  Although TAlk, pH and fCO
2
 
were not sampled as frequently and their 
accuracy is not as well constrained, they also 
represent the state-of-the-art at the time the

3.0 Air-sea CO
2
 fluxes 
 
3.1 Data collection 
 
Between March 1995 and March 1999, CO
2 
measurements were continuously made using 
underway CO
2
 partial pressure (pCO
2
) systems 
during 68 crossings in the northern North Pacific 
Ocean aboard M/S Skaugran (Zeng et al., 2002).  
Most transects from North America to Japan 
followed a great circle route through the Gulf of 
Alaska and Bering Sea, then southward along 
the Kuril Islands.  Routes between Japan and 
North America ranged from 34°N and 50°N in 
the central North Pacific, except one passing 
though Hawaii (Fig. 2).  Measurements for 
seawater were taken every minute, and hourly 
for air, in the units of the mole fraction of CO
2
. 
 
For every crossing, the means of the 1-min CO
2
 
data were averaged for each 1° of longitude.  5° 
means were computed from the 1° means for 
data between 145°E and 125°W.  In order to 
avoid the strong effects of regional variability in 
near-shore waters, the 5° means at the route 
extremes (145°E and 125°W) were calculated 
using data between 145°E and 147.5°E, and 
between 125°W and 127.5°W due to their one-
sidedness.

routes mark the selected latitudinal bands for estimating coefficients of the seasonal function of pCO

using Eq. (2). 
 
 
3.2 Data analysis 
 
Nojiri et al. (1999) evaluated seasonal ∆pCO
2
 at 
5° x 5° resolution using a function consisting of 
four harmonic terms.  This function contains a 
linear latitudinal gradient term independent of 
time, and utilized data that were collected 
between 1995 – 1997.  By using a longer 4-year 
time series, Zeng et al. (2002) found that the 
north–south gradient varied significantly with 
time and longitude.  Therefore, they omitted the 
latitudinal gradient term in the model of Nojiri et 
al. (1999), and instead only used the harmonic 
function:

 cos(4 πt) (2) 
to describe the seasonal ∆pCO
2
 changes with 
time in a box of limited latitude and longitude.  
This is a spatially independent function 
requiring that the seasonal coverage of sampling 
be complete in the defined boxes, and therefore, 
the box size was chosen as a compromise 
between maximizing seasonal coverage and 
minimizing the spatial variations within each 
box. 
 
In order to assure that there is at least one 
crossing per season, the box sizes were selected 
as follows:  for each 5° longitudinal section, 
latitudinal bands were chosen within which 
intervals between any two crossings were less 
than three months.  Two bands encompassing 
the northern and southern boundaries were 
selected first, after which two additional bands 
were inserted between the boundaries.  The 
constraint for the maximum latitudinal range is 
10°.  Figure 2 shows the selected boxes with 
variable latitude range and fixed longitude 
range.  When examining the monthly route 
maps, the latitudinal sampling distribution 
shown in Figure 2 is uneven, i.e., there is only 
one crossing in the area of 170°E – 160°W and 
35°N – 40°N during July – September. 
 
The seasonal cycle of ∆pCO
2
 (i.e., the 
coefficients c
o
 through c
4
) were defined for each 
box using Eq. (2).  Figure 3 shows the results for 
the 175°W section as an example of this 
selection and calculation process.  Four 
latitudinal bands were selected for this longitude 
section, and the seasonal cycle of ∆pCO
2
 is 
displayed for each box.  The interpolation to 1° 
x 1° monthly resolution from the irregular grid 
of distributions of ∆pCO
2
 (as shown in Fig. 2) 
allows computation of basin-wide fluxes and 
facilitates comparison with other regional 
estimates of ∆pCO
2
 and fluxes.

(2);  the diamond symbol shows the observed data. 
 
  
3.3 CO
2
 fluxes 
 
Based on Eq. (2) of Wanninkhof (1992), the air-
sea flux of CO
2
 was calculated from wind speed.  
Monthly CO
2
 fluxes were computed using 
monthly ∆pCO
2
, monthly sea-surface 
temperature and salinity of World Ocean Atlas 
1994 of National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA), and the monthly wind 
fields derived from the European Center for 
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 
2.5° database.  The ECMWF database contains 
winds (at 10 m height above sea surface) for 
every 12 hours.  The monthly wind fields are 
means of 12-hour winds in January 1995 – 
December 1999. 
 
Clear unsynchronized patterns of ∆pCO
2
 
changes were observed for different regions in 
the northern North Pacific.  For the northern 
regions, ∆pCO
2
 is highest in winter and lowest 
in summer.  For the subtropics, this seasonal 
cycle is reversed, with lowest values in winter 
and highest values in summer.  Due to vertical 
mixing in winter (January – March), seawater 
pCO
2
 in the southern Bering Sea, off Kamchatka 
Island, and off the Kuril Islands is higher than in 
the atmosphere (by up to +80 µatm).  In the 
remainder of the northern North Pacific, ∆pCO
2
 
is negative (by as much as –60 µatm), more than 
likely a result of seasonal cooling. 
 
CO
2
 fluxes from this analysis were compared 
with fluxes computed from the data of 
Takahashi et al. (1997).  In order to compare 
results with 4° x 5° grid, their 1° x 1° data were 
averaged to this larger grid, and thus, fluxes for 
both studies were calculated using the same 
resolution of ∆pCO
2
.  Using that approach, both 
data sets show that the northern North Pacific is 
a net CO
2
 sink throughout the year, weakest in 
summer (July – September) and strongest in 
autumn (October – December).  The monthly 
mean CO
2
 flux ranges between –0.06 and –4.7 
moles m
-2
 yr
-1
, with the negative sign indicating 
ocean uptake.  Comparison of monthly mean 
fluxes for the northern North Pacific indicates 
that in spring (April – June) and autumn 
(October – December), monthly fluxes estimated 
from ∆pCO
2
 of Takahashi et al. (1997) are 
systematically more negative than those 
estimated by Zeng et al. (2002); i.e., on average 
17% lower (–15 to –20%) in spring and 44% 
lower (–25% to –56%) in autumn. 
 
Based on the ∆pCO
2
 results, the region between 
34°N and 50°N is estimated to be a small sink 
for carbon of –0.26 Pg C yr
-1
 (Zeng et al. 2002), 
while the integrated net annual flux using the 
data of Takahashi et al. is –0.33 Pg C yr
-1
, 
suggesting 27% more uptake on an annual basis. 
 
The vessel-of-opportunity measurement program 
aboard commercial vessels offers sampling 
frequency throughout all seasons, enabling the 
oceanographic community to better understand 
the long-term variability of the ocean carbon 
cycle. 
 
  
 
  
4.0 DIC, TAlk and anthropogenic CO
2
 distributions in the North Pacific 
 
4.1 Distributions of DIC and TAlk 
 
The lowest concentrations of DIC and TAlk in 
the North Pacific are observed in surface waters.  
Variations in surface carbon concentrations 
(DIC range:  1975 – 2200 µmol kg
-1
;  TAlk 
range:  2200 – 2400 µmol kg
-1
) are roughly 
correlated with salinity.  The general structure of 
the DIC and TAlk fields in the upper 1,000 m is 
similar to the density structure, suggesting that 
circulation plays a strong role in their 
distributions.  The highest DIC concentrations 
are found in the intermediate waters and form a 
large maximum (2325 – 2375 µmol kg
-1
) at 
approximately 1,800 – 2,200 m in the North 
Pacific (Fig. 4).  In contrast, TAlk 
concentrations show a local minima in the 
Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) to the 
south and in the North Pacific Intermediate 
Water (NPIW) to the north (Fig. 5).  Below the 
NPIW, TAlk concentrations increase to a broad 
maximum at approximately 2,200 – 4,000 m 
(TAlk concentrations range from 2,400 – 2,460 
µmol kg
-1
).  The differences between the DIC 
and TAlk, particularly in intermediate waters, 
are caused by in-situ re-mineralization 
processes.  The DIC maximum is shallower than 
the TAlk maximum because the total inorganic 
carbon is more strongly influenced by the 
shallow re-mineralization of soft tissue organic 
matter, whereas the total alkalinity is more 
strongly influenced by the dissolution of calcium

carbonate particles deeper in the water column 
(Chen, 1990).  South of 30°N, bottom waters 
have lower DIC and TAlk concentrations than 
the waters at mid-depths because the northward 
moving bottom waters have not had time to 
accumulate as much carbon.  The southward 
moving waters at 2,000 – 3,000 m in the North 
Pacific are among the oldest waters in the global 
ocean (Stuiver et al., 1983). 
 
The zonal DIC and TAlk isolines shoal from 
west to east along the P2 section at 30°N in the 
North Pacific (Fig. 6).  Deep ventilation near the 
Kuroshio Extension and the subsequent 
circulation in the subtropical gyre generates the 
zonal gradients of DIC and TAlk in the upper 
1,500 m.  Both DIC and TAlk concentrations 
show the deepest ventilation near the coast and 
under the Kuroshio Extension, west of 160°E.  
These trends are also observed in the North 
Pacific chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and 
anthropogenic CO
2
 distributions providing 
further evidence of stronger ventilation in the 
western Pacific (Warner et al., 1996. Sabine et 
al., 2002). 
 
4.2 Anthropogenic CO
2
 distributions 
 
The approach used here for estimating 
anthropogenic CO
2
 in the Pacific Ocean is based 
on the ∆C* method first described by Gruber et 
al. (1996).  Gruber et al. improved the earlier 
approaches of Brewer (1978) and Chen and 
Millero (1979) by developing the quasi-
conservative tracer, ∆C*.  The assumption is that 
the anthropogenic CO
2
 concentration (C
ant
) can

be isolated from measured DIC values (C
m
) by 
subtracting the contribution of the organic and 
inorganic biological pumps ( ∆C
bio
), the DIC the 
waters would have in equilibrium with a pre-
industrial atmospheric CO
2
 concentration of 280 
ppm (C
eq280
), and a term ( ∆C
diseq
) that corrects 
for the fact that surface waters are not always in 
equilibrium with the atmosphere (air-sea 
difference in CO
2
 concentration expressed in 
µmol kg
-1
 of DIC): 
C
ant
 = C
m
 – ∆C
bio
 – C
eq280
 – ∆C
diseq
 = ∆C* – 
∆C
diseq
 (3) 
 
The three terms to the right of the first equal 
sign make up ∆C* (i.e., ∆C* = C
m
 – ∆C
bio
 – 
C
eq280
), which can be explicitly calculated for 
each sample.  The fact that ∆C* is a quasi-
conservative tracer helps remedy some of the 
mixing concerns arising from the earlier 
techniques (Sabine and Feely, 2001).  The 
∆C
diseq
 term is evaluated over small isopycnal 
intervals using a water-mass age tracer such as 
CFCs (Sabine et al., 2002).  
 
The biological correction in the ∆C* calculation 
has two components.  The organic component 
uses changes in apparent oxygen utilization 
(AOU), together with a stoichiometric C:O ratio, 
to estimate how much DIC has increased due to 
organic re-mineralization since leaving the 
surface.  The second component uses the 
difference between the measured total alkalinity 
(TAlk) and a pre-formed total alkalinity (TAlk°) 
to estimate the changes in DIC resulting from 
the dissolution of calcium carbonate particles.  
There is also a small organic adjustment on the 
  
carbonate correction term to account for the 
effect of the proton flux on TAlk.  The 
stoichiometric ratios used for the biological 
corrections are based on the work of Anderson 
and Sarmiento (1994). 
 
The C
eq280
 term uses a linearized form of the 
carbonate equilibrium equations, together with 
the preformed alkalinity and an fCO
2
 value of 
280 µatm, to calculate the equilibrium DIC 
concentration. 
 
The ∆C* calculation used for this study is 
essentially the same as that originally defined by 
Gruber et al. (1996) with two small differences:  
a modification of TAlk° based on the new global 
survey data, and the addition of a denitrification 
term in the biological correction:

value that the waters would have at their 
potential temperature and one atmosphere total 
pressure (i.e. if they were adiabatically raised to 
the surface), and N*
anom
 is the N* anomaly 
described later in this section. 
 
The TAlk° formulation of Gruber et al. (1996) 
was based on MLR fit of surface TAlk values 
from the GEOSECS, SAVE, and TTO cruises.  
Sabine et al. (1999) derived a revised TAlk° 
equation based on the WOCE/JGOFS Indian 
Ocean data.  The Pacific TAlk° term proposed 
by Sabine et al. (2002) was estimated using all 
of the Pacific alkalinity data shallower than 60 
m (~1,900 data points). The form of the equation 
is the same as that used by Sabine et al. (1999): 
TAlk° = 148.7(± 9) + 61.36(± 0.3) * S + 
 0.0941(± 0.005) * PO – 0.582(± 0.07) * θ (5) 
where PO is a quasi-conservative tracer similar 
to that introduced by Broecker (1974) (PO = 
dissolved oxygen – 170* phosphate (PO
4
)).  The 
standard error in the Pacific TAlk° equation is 
±9 µmol kg
-1
.  All four terms are highly 
significant as shown with a standard ANOVA 
analysis. 
 
Sabine et al. (2002) also proposed a correction 
to the biological adjustment in (3) to account for 
denitrification in the water column.  
Denitrification re-mineralizes carbon with a very 
different stoichiometric ratio to nitrogen than 
standard aerobic respiration (Anderson, 1995;

Sabine et al. (1999) estimated the denitrification 
signal using the N* tracer of Gruber and 
Sarmiento (1997).  The slightly more 
generalized N* tracer of Deutch et al. (2001) 
was used by Sabine et al. (2002): 
N* = N – 16*P + 2.90 (8) 
 
The only change from Gruber and Sarmiento 
(1997) was that their original equation was 
scaled by a factor of 0.87.  The revised equation 
is simpler and is more general because it 
removes built-in assumptions about the nitrogen 
loss from the organic reservoir (Deutsch et al., 
2001).  In practice, this modification actually has 
no impact on the final denitrification corrections 
since that signal is identified as an N* anomaly 
from the mean.  The mean N* value for this data 
set was –1.5 µmol kg
-1
, in agreement with the 
findings of Deutsch et al. (2001).  The 
denitrification stoichiometric ratio of 106/104 
from (7) (Gruber and Sarmiento, 1997) was used 
to correct the ∆C* values in Eq. (4), where N* 
showed a negative anomaly.  
 
For given isopycnal surfaces, the air-sea 
disequilibrium component can be discriminated 
from the anthropogenic signal using either 
information about the water age (e.g., from 
transient tracers such as CFCs or 
3
H-
3
He) or the 
distribution of ∆C* in regions not affected by 
  
the anthropogenic transient.  In the case where 
C
anth
 can be assumed to be zero over some 
portion of an isopycnal surface (i.e., ∆C* = 0 + 
∆C
diseq
), the disequilibrium term is set equal to 
the average of the ∆C* values for that portion of 
the surface.  For shallow surfaces, that cannot be 
assumed to be free of anthropogenic CO
2
, we 
use the ∆C*
t
 term of Gruber et al. (1996).  ∆C*
t 
is derived in the same manner as ∆C*, but rather 
than evaluating the carbon concentration the 
waters would have in equilibrium with a pre-
industrial atmosphere, they are evaluated with 
respect to the CO
2
 concentration the atmosphere 
had when the waters were last at the surface.  In 
this study, calculations are based on the 
concentration ages determined from CFC-12 
measurements ( ∆C*
t12
):

where C

 is DIC calculated from TAlk° and the

collection minus CFC age).  The ∆C
diseq
 terms 
for these surfaces are then set equal to the mean 
of the ∆C*
t12
 values on each surface.  
 
Several papers have been published recently 
evaluating the ∆C* approach for calculating 
anthropogenic CO
2
 ( e.g. Wanninkhof et al., 
1999; Coatanoan et al., 2001; Sabine and Feely, 
2001; Orr et al., 2001).  It has been recognized 
that the evaluation of the ∆C
diseq
 term is one of 
the most problematic steps in the estimation of 
anthropogenic CO
2
.  One important assumption 
in the evaluation of ∆C
diseq
 is that the global 
mean air-sea CO
2
 disequilibrium has remained 
constant over time.  Although this assumption is 
consistent with most contemporary CO
2
 time-
series measurements in the Pacific (e.g. Inoue et 
al., 1995; Winn et al., 1998; Feely et al., 1999; 
Takahashi et al., 1999), it cannot be true over 
time-scales extending into the pre-industrial 
period or the oceans would not be acting as a 
sink for anthropogenic CO
2
.  Gruber et al. 
(1996) estimated that an average global uptake 
of about 2 Pg C yr
-1
 would correspond to an air-
sea disequilibrium of about 5 µmol kg
-1
 in 
∆C
diseq
.  If this signal is spread out over the 
entire record since pre-industrial times, it would 
be very difficult to see in the ∆C * value given 
the uncertainties in the calculation.  This 5 µmol 
kg
-1 
uncertainty can be considered the theoretical 
minimum detection limit for this technique as it 
is currently used. 
 
Anthropogenic CO
2
 concentrations in the North 
Pacific reach a maximum value of about 40 - 50 
µmol kg
-1
 in the subtropical surface waters (Fig. 
7).  These surface concentrations are slightly 
lower than observed in other oceans, but may 
reflect differences in the surface buffer factor of 
different oceans.  The distribution patterns of 
anthropogenic CO
2
 in the ocean interior 
generally follow density isolines.  The relatively 
shallow penetration of anthropogenic CO
2
 in the 
North Pacific is in strong contrast to the Atlantic 
distribution, where anthropogenic CO
2
 has 
penetrated all the way to the bottom in the 
northern high latitudes (Gruber et al., 1996; 
Wanninkhof et al., 1999; Körtzinger et al., 
1999).  These differences result from the lack of 
any significant deep-water formation in the 
North Pacific (Reid, 1997), and the long time-
scales for replacement of North Pacific deep 
waters from the south (Stuiver et al., 1983).  In 
the North Pacific, deep ventilation within the 
Kuroshio Extension and the subsequent 
circulation in the subtropical gyre generates a 
strong zonal gradient in the anthropogenic CO
2
 
penetration depth (Fig. 8).  At approximately 
30ºN (WOCE line P2), the 5 µmol kg
-1
 contour 
is found at a depth of about 500 m near the 
North American coast, but deepens to 
approximately 1,000 m off Japan.  The zonal 
gradient is also enhanced by the significant role 
that the Sea of Okhotsk plays in the formation of 
North Pacific Intermediate Water (Warner et al., 
1996).  Although no data from the Sea of 
Okhotsk were included in this analysis, Figure 9 
clearly shows unusually high anthropogenic CO
2
 
concentrations near the entrance to the Sea on a 
density surface that corresponds to the NPIW.

anthropogenic CO
2
 content leads to higher total 
column inventories in the western North Pacific 
(Fig. 10).  The gyre circulation and mixing 
works to smear out the signal generating the 
broad feature observed in Figure 10.  The 
integrated amount of anthropogenic CO
2
 in the 
North Pacific is estimated to be 16.5 Pg C 
through 1994, north of the equator but not 
including the marginal seas (Sabine et al., 2002).  
This estimate is approximately 16% of the 
amount of anthropogenic CO
2
 taken by the 
global oceans (Feely et al., 1999).

latitude.  Indian values are from Sabine et al. (1999).  Atlantic values are from Gruber (1998). 
 
 
In the higher northern latitudes, the area-specific 
water column inventories of the North Atlantic 
can be higher than in the North Pacific, because 
of the formation of North Atlantic Deep waters 
that transport anthropogenic CO
2
 into the ocean 
interior.  These large values are sufficient to 
make total inventories highest in the North 
Atlantic despite the larger area of the North 
Pacific (Fig. 11).  One should note that the North 
Atlantic values of Gruber (1998), given in 
Figure 11, represent inventories from the late 
1980s.  These values would be somewhat higher 
if they were scaled up to the WOCE timeframe. 
 
Since the exact distribution of anthropogenic 
CO
2
 cannot be directly measured, it is useful to 
compare estimates derived from different 
approaches.  Recently, Xu et al. (2000) 
examined the uptake and storage of 
anthropogenic CO
2
 with a medium resolution (2º 
x 2º x 28 levels) basin-wide OGCM of the North 
Pacific.  Their study tested the impact of 
changing the isopycnal diffusivity on the 
anthropogenic uptake of the model.  Although 
all of the model runs presented by Xu et al. 
suggested higher North Pacific inventories (19.4 
– 22.01 Pg C north of equator) than determined 
with this study, the model run with the lowest 
diffusivities gave results that were most 
consistent with the above estimates.  Likewise, 
models can help evaluate various observational-
based approaches.  For example, Xu et al. also 
compared their results in the western North 
Pacific with the results of Chen (1993a).  They 
noted that Chen had a deeper penetration and 
stronger meridional changes in penetration depth 
than could be generated with the model.  Our 
results, however, are much more similar to the 
  
model distributions with penetration depths 
close to 1,000 m and meridional changes in 
penetration depth about half (250 m) of that 
observed by Chen (1993a) in the western North 
Pacific. 
 
The ∆C* approach for estimating anthropogenic 
CO
2
 has been applied now in the three major 
oceans:  the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific.  Small 
modifications to the technique continue to 
improve the quality of the results.  Each time the 
technique is applied to a new region, new 
challenges are faced.  The basic principles of the 
technique, however, have remained the same 
and appear to be sound.  The total amount of 
anthropogenic CO
2
 inventory in the North 
Pacific is approximately 37% of the total for the 
Pacific Ocean (Sabine et al., 2002).  This 
relatively low inventory in the North Pacific 
primarily results from large-scale circulation 
within the Pacific.  The deep waters of the 
Pacific are among the oldest in the global 
oceans, and thus have not been exposed to 
anthropogenic contamination.  The lack of deep-
water formation in the North Pacific results in 
relatively little penetration of anthropogenic CO
2
 
into the ocean interior.  The tremendous area, 
diversity of habitats, and corrosiveness of the 
Pacific waters with respect to carbonate 
minerals, however, provide the potential for 
significant changes in carbon cycling in this 
ocean as a result of future climate change.  Some 
of these changes may lead to changes in the role 
of the Pacific as a sink for anthropogenic CO
2
.  
The global CO
2
 survey data and estimates 
provided here make an important baseline for 
assessing future changes in the Pacific carbon 
cycle. 
 
4.3 Temporal variations in anthropogenic 
carbon accumulation 
 
MLR analysis, as described by Brewer et al. 
(1995), and subsequently by others (Wallace, 
1995, Slansky et al., 1997, Goyet and Davis 
1997, Sabine et al., 1999), was used to estimate 
the anthropogenic CO
2
 increase in the North 
Pacific from data collected between 1973 and 
1999.  In this procedure, the coefficients that 
describe the naturally occurring variations in 
oceanic CO
2
 were calculated from a statistical 
model.  The model used salinity (S), potential 
temperature ( θ), apparent oxygen utilization 
(AOU), and concentration of silicate (Si(OH)
4
) 
and phosphate (PO
4
) to construct a forward 
linear stepwise regression to predict DIC. 
 
The area chosen for this study was between 30 - 
50°N, and 140 - 180°W (Fig. 12).  All cruises 
within that region were included where high 
quality DIC data, along with other hydrographic 
parameters, was available throughout the water 
column (GEOSECS, NOAA ENP81, WHPs 
P16N, P15N, P2, P1, and NOPP). 
 
In order to predict the DIC using the MLR 
technique, the equation derived for the best 
functional form for the regional data was: 
DIC = a θ + bS + cAOU + dSi(OH)
4
 + ePO
4
 (10) 
where AOU, Si(OH)
4
 and PO
4
 are the measured 
concentrations for a given water sample in µmol 
kg
-1
. 
 
The DIC data were corrected to CRMs where 
available;  otherwise, the only correction made 
was –29 µmol kg
-1
 to the GEOSECS DIC 
(Takahashi, pers. communication).  A second-
order polynomial equation for all parameters 
used in the MLR for each cruise was then fitted 
against mid- to deep (1,250 – 3,500 m) σ
θ
 
ranging from 27.48 – 27.78.  The deepest data 
(>3,500 m) was not used in the fit.  The 
individual parameters for each cruise were then 
adjusted throughout the water column relative to 
P16N data as necessary. 
 
Although the region of study crosses two major 
water mass systems (the subtropical gyre and 
subarctic gyre), a single set of P16N coefficients 
was used to predict DIC for each of the cruises.  
The mixed layer depth (MLD) for each cruise 
was determined using Levitus’ wintertime 
conditions.  MLD west of 160°W ranged from 
approximately 120 – 200 m, and 100 – 120 m 
east of 160°W.  Each cruise was separated into 
  
sections based on its MLD (surface to bottom of 
the MLD, and bottom of the MLD to 1,250 m).  
Anthropogenic CO
2
 does not generally extend 
deeper than 800 – 1,000 m in the region of study 
based on CFC penetration (Bullister, personal 
communication), and therefore we chose 1250 m  
 
as the bottom depth of our study in order to 
encompass that depth and slightly beyond.  
Since mixing mostly occurs along isopycnal 
surfaces, the residual data from each cruise were 
then binned according to σ
θ
 ranges and the mean 
and standard deviation were determined. 
 
 
 
Fig. 12 Station locations used for MLR analysis to assess temporal variability in anthropogenic carbon 
accumulation. 
 
 
Using P16N as a reference, the results of the 
MLR show an estimated CO
2
 uptake rate 
through the mixed layer of 1.3 ± 0.2 µmol DIC 
kg
-1
 yr
-1
 in the North Pacific (Fig. 13).  The 
uptake of CO
2
 below the MLD (Fig. 14) was 
calculated by two different methods, each 
yielding similar results.  The mean residual DIC 
for each cruise was plotted against time and an 
average slope was determined (0.62 ± 0.13 µmol 
kg
-1
 yr
-1
).  For comparison, a slightly more 
robust method was utilized for the deeper 
waters:  the σ
θ
 binned residuals for each cruise 
were averaged and divided by the age of the 
cruise relative to P16N.  The mean uptake rate 
of each cruise was then calculated, resulting in 
an estimate of 0.79 ± 0.4 µmol kg
-1
 yr
-1
.  The 
total integrated CO
2
 uptake from the surface to 
1,250 m is estimated to be approximately 1.1 ±  
0.4 mol C m

-1

5.0 Biogeochemical impacts and global implications 
 
Concern about long-term impacts of climate 
variability and anthropogenic CO
2
 increases in 
the oceans has prompted North Pacific 
researchers to re-examine the fundamental 
processes controlling the organic carbon and 
CaCO
3
 budgets in the region.  The primary 
motivation for this research is that biological 
production and export of organic matter, and 
CaCO
3
 production and export are important 
mechanisms by which carbon is exported from 
the surface ocean to the abyss.  By looking at 
data in the main thermocline, longer-term 
secular trends and cycles have been observed.  
This approach takes advantage of the fact that 
the residence times of waters, and hence, 
biogeochemical properties increase with depth, 
and that flow in the ocean interior is primarily 
along constant potential density surfaces.  
Biogeochemical variations along isopycnal 
surfaces may therefore reflect past variations.  
Recent studies in the North Pacific have 
suggested that oxygen in the upper thermocline 
has decreased 10 – 15% over the past two 
decades (Emerson et al., 2001; Ono et al., 
2001a; Keller et al., 2002).  In the eastern 
Pacific, the observed 8 – 40 µmol kg
-1
 oxygen 
decrease between 100 and 500 m from 1991 to 
1997 may reflect large-scale changes in 
thermocline ventilation and/or ecosystem 
dynamics.  Similarly, Feely et al. (2002) found 
substantial upward migration of aragonite and 
calcite saturation horizons in the upper 
thermocline of the North Pacific, which they 
attributed to decreases in carbonate ion 
concentrations resulting from anthropogenic 
CO
2
 penetration into the water column since pre-
industrial time. 
 
These biogeochemical effects follow other 
studies that have suggested large-scale variations 
in the Pacific.  McPhaden and Zhang (2002) 
observed a 25% decrease in transport 
convergences and meridional overturning over 
the past 25 years, consistent with a decrease in 
thermocline ventilation.  Karl and co-workers 
(Karl et al., 1997; Karl, 1999) found a two-fold 
primary production increase and corresponding 
increases in suspended particle N:P ratios at 
HOT between the 1980s and the 1990s.  They 
attributed these changes to a major ecosystem 
domain shift from nitrate-based diatom-
dominated ecosystem to a Prochlorococcus-
dominated N
2
 fixation ecosystem.  Karl (1999) 
suggests that the shift may be related to the 
persistence of unusually warm waters in the 
Subtropical Pacific resulting from the long 
succession of ENSO events.  These observations 
are also consistent with a regime shift from a 
negative to a positive phase of the Pacific 
Decadal Oscillation (PDO). 
 
All of these independent observations indicate 
that the North Pacific Ocean is undergoing 
substantial physical, chemical and biological 
changes over time.  The response of the ocean 
carbon cycle to climate variability and global 
warming will continue to undergo varying 
degrees of both positive and negative climate 
feedbacks.  The magnitude of these feedbacks 
and their interactions are currently not well 
understood, but potentially could lead to 
significant changes in the ability of the ocean to 
sequester anthropogenic CO
2
 in the future.  If, as 
many models suggest, the net feedbacks are 
positive (i.e., reduced uptake of anthropogenic 
CO
2
 by the ocean in a warming world) the 
required socio-economical strategies to stabilize 
CO
2
 in the future will be much more stringent 
than in the absence of such feedbacks.  Future 
studies of the carbon system in the North Pacific 
should be designed to identify and quantitatively 
assess these feedback mechanisms in order to 
provide input to models that will determine their 
importance on the ocean’s future capacity to 
absorb the anthropogenic CO
2
 from the 
atmosphere. 
 
  
 
  
6.0 Recommendations for the future of carbon studies within PICES 
 
Over the past four years, PICES, through the 
activities of its Working Group 13, played a major 
role in fostering international cooperation among 
member nations towards the integration and 
synthesis of the WOCE/JGOFS global CO
2
 survey 
data in the North Pacific.  Appendix A summarizes 
the specific activities of the Working Group from 
1998 through the end of 2001.  The Working 
Group 13: 
null supported CO
2
 inter-comparison studies for 
carbon species; 
null developed strategies for exchanging data at the 
international level; 
null promoted collaborative interactions towards 
the analysis and synthesis of the global CO
2
 
survey data; 
null sponsored several meetings and symposia on 
CO
2
 system dynamics in the North Pacific. 
 
These activities were essential for resolving data 
synthesis issues and developing strong 
collaborations for the integration of the large CO
2
 
data set in the North Pacific Ocean.  As we strive 
to increase our understanding of how the carbon 
system in the North Pacific will respond to global 
warming and large-scale climate shifts in the 
future, there is an increasing need for PICES to 
continue its focus on carbon system dynamics.  
Below are several recommendations for future 
activities that PICES could support to greatly 
improve our knowledge of the carbon system in 
the North Pacific. 
 
1. The next phase of carbon research in the North 
Pacific will involve repeat measurements of 
carbon system and biological parameters, 
tracers and hydrography at time-series stations 
and along repeat sections of the 
WOCE/JGOFS Global CO
2
 survey.  These 
studies are designed to determine the physical, 
chemical and biological changes controlling 
the carbon system in the North Pacific, and 
how these changes affect the ocean’s response 
to climate variability and global warming.  
PICES should continue to provide a venue for 
data exchange and program coordination at the 
international level to ensure optimal use of 
resources to obtain appropriate temporal and 
spatial coverage as well as maximum 
comparability with historical data.  This could 
be done as part of a joint effort with the 
Climate Variability and Predictability Program 
(CLIVAR) and Global Carbon Project (GCP). 
 
2. Little is known about the exchange of 
anthropogenic CO
2
 from the marginal seas to 
the open North Pacific.  In some cases, 
particularly in the northwest Pacific including 
the Sea of Okhotsk and Bering Sea, water 
mass formation in the marginal seas plays a 
significant role in the formation of 
Intermediate Water.  How anthropogenic CO
2
 
is ventilated and transported from the marginal 
seas to intermediate depths in the North 
Pacific Ocean is the subject of much research 
by member countries of PICES.  PICES 
should support synthesis activities for carbon 
system parameters from these regional studies 
and foster integrated studies between the 
marginal seas and the open North Pacific. 
 
3. In association with existing Data Centers, 
PICES should take the lead in developing a 
North Pacific database for ocean CO
2
 and 
related parameters, and provide advice to Data 
Centers on which of the available historical 
data sets should be assigned a high priority for 
acquisition and conversion to an electronically 
readable form. 
 
4. PICES should support the preparation of a 
written Guide of best practices for oceanic 
CO
2 
measurements and data reporting, and 
carry out, as needed, inter-laboratory method 
comparisons to assure future measurement 
quality and encourage the availability of 
suitable reference materials. 
 
5. PICES should continue to sponsor 
symposiums and/or annual meeting sessions 
on the impacts of climate change on the 
carbon cycle in the North Pacific Ocean.

Summary of PICES Working Group 13 activities (1998 – 2001) 
 
The PICES Working Group 13 on CO
2
 in the 
North Pacific was established in 1998 under the 
direction of the Physical Oceanography and 
Climate Committee, and was co-chaired by Dr. 
Richard A. Feely of the Pacific Marine 
Environmental Laboratory (Seattle, U.S.A.) and 
Dr. Yukihiro Nojiri of the National Institute for 
Environmental Studies (Tsukuba, Japan).  Table 
5 provides a list of the Working Group 
members.  The terms of reference for the 
Working Group were the following: 
1. Review the present level of knowledge on 
the processes controlling CO
2
 in the North 
Pacific, and identify the gaps and problems; 
2. Review the existing methodology of CO
2
 
measurements, including the preparation of 
standards and reference materials, and 
advise on intercalibration and quality control 
procedures; 
3. Identify and encourage ongoing and planned 
national and international CO
2
-related 
scientific programs in the North Pacific 
region, including long-term time-series 
observations;  and 
4. In coordination with TCODE (PICES 
Technical Committee on Data Exchange), 
identify available and suitable data sets on 
the oceanic CO
2
 system and recommend the 
mechanisms of data and information 
exchange. 
 
Table 6 summarizes activities of the Working 
Group in chronological order;  several of those 
were conducted jointly with the JGOFS North 
Pacific Task Team (NPTT).  The Working 
Group met each year at the PICES Annual 
Meeting to coordinate research activities, 
exchange data and work to integrate the large-
scale CO
2
 data sets from the North Pacific.  The 
meetings were well attended as each member 
presented a summary of country’s research 
directions in carbon cycling, and invitees 
provided detailed information on ongoing and 
planned national and international CO
2
-related 
scientific programs in the region.  As a direct 
outcome, the Working Group recommended the 
re-occupation of, and exchange of samples 
during, the repeat WOCE/JGOFS sections P1, 
P2 and P16N in the North Pacific.

To improve the existing methodology of CO
2
 
measurements, the Working Group supported 
three international CO
2
 measurement inter-
comparison studies:  for dissolved inorganic 
carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TAlk) and the 
13
C/
12
C ratio of the inorganic carbon in seawater.  
The first two, each followed up with a Technical 
Workshop, were completed in April 1999 and 
October 2000 (see summary in Appendix B).  
The third inter-comparison was initiated in late 
2001 and is still ongoing.  Participants have been 
identified (8 laboratories from Canada, Japan, 
U.S.A., Australia, Germany, France and China-
Taipei), and samples were distributed in the 
beginning of December 2001, and analyzed 
during 2002.  This activity will be continued and 
summarized by a new Working Group on 
Biogeochemical data integration and synthesis 
(WG 17) established to retain a scientific focus 
on the carbon cycle within PICES.  A workshop, 
if needed, will be organized to discuss the results 
from the 
13
C/
12
C inter-comparison.  The 
Working Group 17 has supported an on-land 
inter-comparison of underway and 
drifting/mooring pCO
2
 measurement systems 
held in spring of 2003, in Japan, with 
participants from PICES countries as well as 
from Europe and Australia. 
To review the present level of knowledge on the 
processes controlling CO
2
 in the North Pacific, 
the Working Group co-sponsored an 
international symposium on CO
2
 in the Oceans 
(January 1999, Tsukuba, Japan) and organized, 
jointly with the JGOFS NPTT, a Topic Session 
on North Pacific carbon cycling and ecosystem 
dynamics at PICES IX (October 2000, 
Hakodate, Japan) and an international North 
Pacific CO
2
 Data Synthesis Symposium 
(October 2000, Tsukuba, Japan). 
 
At the latter symposium, co-sponsored by the 
JST/CREST Program and hosted by the National 
Institute of Environmental Studies (Japan), a 
clear need was recognized to conduct an effort 
to bring scientists and data managers together to 
discuss the procedures for developing a North 
Pacific CO
2
 database.  This was implemented in 
2001 as a series of two workshops that were 
organized jointly with TCODE.  The first CO
2
 
Data Planning Workshop was held at the 
Institute of Ocean Sciences (Sidney, Canada) in 
January 2001, to discuss the likely technical 
issues involved in such a project, and to plan a 
second more detailed workshop that was held at 
the Japan Oceanographic Data Center (Tokyo, 
Japan) in August 2001.  The objective for the 
  
CO
2
 Data Integration Workshop was to develop 
strategies for the exchange of CO
2
 and related 
data at the international level, and to examine 
the technical issues in integrating presently 
available data into a uniform data structure or 
database.  Both workshops met their goals (see 
summary in Appendix C), and PICES now has a 
unified plan for data submission and exchange.  
The PICES Working Group 17, in association 
with existing Data Centers, will continue this 
work to complete the North Pacific database for 
ocean CO
2
 and related parameters and to ensure 
its continuous update. 
Activities of the PICES Working Group 13 were 
recognized by the IOC-SCOR Ocean Carbon 
Advisory Panel as essential for improving the 
overall quality of oceanic CO
2
 measurements, 
resolving data synthesis issues and developing 
strong collaborations for the integration of the 
large CO
2
 data set in the North Pacific.  The 
Panel emphasized the importance of 
international participation in the design of Ocean 
Carbon Observation System and supported 
PICES as an excellent forum for the Pacific 
region. 
 
  
 
  
Appendix B. 
Results of Working Group 13 method inter-comparison studies 
 
One of the first questions asked of analytical 
measurements is:  how reliable are they?  This 
was a key concern of the PICES Working Group 
13 on CO
2
 in the North Pacific, which desired 
that measurements made at different times, by 
different investigators, from different 
laboratories in the various PICES nations, be 
comparable and correct. 
 
In October 1998, at the first meeting of the 
Working Group (Fairbanks, U.S.A.), it was 
decided that, as one of the first steps towards 
this goal, the Working Group would plan and 
carry out a series of between-laboratory 
comparisons of measurement techniques for 
such carbonate parameters as dissolved 
inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TAlk) 
and the 
13
C/
12
C ratio of the inorganic carbon in 
seawater. 
 
For our initial studies, the Working Group 
decided to focus on the measurement of DIC and 
of TAlk in seawater.  The plan was to conduct 
an inter-laboratory comparison of these 
measurements on some natural sea water 
samples, and then to hold a technical workshop 
to discuss the results of these studies, and to 
initiate detailed technical exchange regarding 
measurement techniques and data quality 
between the scientists involved in studying CO
2
 
in the North Pacific. 
 
Inter-comparison conducted during 1999 
 
Preparations for this exercise were started 
almost immediately after the Working Group 
meeting in Fairbanks.  Four separate samples 
based on natural seawater were prepared: 
null a Certified Reference Material (Batch 45) 
supplied by Dr. Andrew Dickson of the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
(U.S.A.); 
null an unknown surface seawater sample 
supplied by Dr. Dickson, and prepared in the 
same way as the Scripps CRMs (it was, in 
fact, later distributed as CRM - Batch 46); 
null an unknown surface seawater sample 
supplied by Dr. Nobuo Tsurushima of the 
National Institute of Environmental Studies 
(Japan), and prepared in the same way as the 
University of Hokkaido secondary standards 
for DIC;  and 
null an unknown deep-sea water sample supplied 
by Dr. Akihiko Murata of JAMSTEC, based 
on water collected in November 1998, on 
the R/V Mirai from a depth of 3,000 m, 
filtered and sterilized. 
 
The samples were distributed to the participating 
laboratories in January 1999 (with one exception 
sent out in March 1999).  In all, fourteen 
laboratories were involved:  seven from Japan, 
four from the United States, and one from each 
of Canada, Korea, and China-Taipei (Table 7).  
Results were returned promptly from all of these 
laboratories! 
 
A follow-up technical workshop took place 
April 20–22, 1999, at the National Institute for 
Research on the Environment (NIRE) in 
Tuskuba, Japan.  The workshop was organized 
by Dr. Yukihiro Nojiri (NIES) and Dr. Koh 
Harada (NIRE), and was supported jointly by 
PICES, Kansai Environmental Engineering 
Center (KEEC) and JAMSTEC.  A total of 
thirty-one participants from the various 
laboratories (including an observer from Russia) 
enjoyed a detailed discussion of the analytical 
techniques used by their laboratories for the 
measurement of DIC and TAlk (Fig. 15).  This 
discussion was facilitated by having the 
analytical instruments from a number of the 
participating groups set up in a laboratory next 
to the meeting room. 
 
The results of the actual inter-comparison were 
discussed in detail at the workshop, and were 
relatively encouraging.  For DIC the results from 
a number of laboratories clearly reflected the 
  
effects of calibration problems.  However, once 
the various values for DIC had been adjusted to 
a common calibration scale (using the 
measurements made on the Certified Reference 
Material), the agreement between the various 
laboratories was excellent (±2 µmol kg
-1
) (Fig. 
16).  For TAlk, the results were more 
disappointing, although reduction to a common 
calibration scale helped to reduce the extent of 
disagreement, there were still major inter-
laboratory differences (±12 µmol kg
-1
) (Fig. 17).  
A brief report describing this activity and the 
technical workshop was in July 1999, in PICES 
Press, Vol. 7 (2).

Inter-comparison conducted during 2000 
 
As a result of the 1999 inter-comparison, it was 
decided that a further study should be 
conducted, which would focus on the 
measurement of TAlk to see just how effective 
the 1999 technical workshop had been.  Again, 
four separate samples based on natural seawater 
were used: 
null a CRM (Batch 50) supplied by Dr. Andrew 
Dickson of the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography (U.S.A.); 
null an unknown surface seawater sample 
supplied by Dr. Dickson, and prepared in the 
same way as the Scripps CRMs (it was, in 
fact, later distributed as CRM - Batch 51); 
• an unknown surface seawater sample 
supplied by Dr. Nobuo Tsurushima, and 
prepared in the same way as the University 
of Hokkaido secondary standards for DIC; 
• an unknown deep sea water sample supplied 
by Dr. Akihiko Murata of JAMSTEC, based 
on water collected in November 1999, on 
the R/V Mirai from a depth of 3,000 m, 
filtered and sterilized.

The samples were distributed to the participating 
laboratories in March 2000.  This time twelve 
laboratories were involved (Table 7):  six from 
Japan, three from the United States, and one 
from each of Canada, Korea, and Russia.  The 
follow-up workshop was held in October 2000, 
again in Tsukuba, Japan, and was attended by 
twenty-four scientists, including both members 
of the participating laboratories and some 
observers (Fig. 18). 
 
Clear progress had been made in the year since 
the 1999 inter-comparison.  After adjustment of 
the various data to a common calibration scale 
  
set by CRM-50, the majority of the results (10 
laboratories out of 12) were within a range of 5 
µmol kg
–1
 (Fig. 19).  This result is typical for 
laboratories with experience in this 
measurement, and indicates the increased skills 
of the participating laboratories have acquired 
over the past year.  Nevertheless, it is essential 
to maintain an awareness of potential inter-
laboratory calibration problems, and the sources 
of these were discussed at length during the 
workshop.  One recommendation was that each 
laboratory develop an approach that 
independently calibrates the TAlk system, so 
that the CRMs can be used as an independent 
check on the calibration.  The workshop again 
spent time reiterating the details of TAlk 
measurements so as to build upon this success.  
A brief report describing this activity and the 
technical workshop was in January 2001, in 
PICES Press, Vol. 9 (1). 
 
Conclusion 
 
The strategy used here, distribution of samples 
for analysis (including a calibration sample) 
followed by a technical workshop for detailed 
discussion of the results and of the various 
analytical techniques employed, is clearly very 
effective.  
The present state-of-the-art methodology and 
technique for the analysis of DIC in seawater is 
mature.  Most institutions use some variant of 
the extraction and coulometric analysis 
technique, and provided the instrument is well 
calibrated (e.g., with appropriate reference 
materials), results of good quality can be 
obtained.  This is in broad agreement with the 
experience of a variety of groups during the 
WOCE/JGOFS era. 
 
Similarly, the problems with TAlk 
measurements also echo the experiences of a 
variety of groups in the WOCE/JGOFS era.  The 
difficulties with this measurement cannot be 
attributed solely to calibration problems.  Other 
factors play a clear role in the uncertainty of 
these measurements.  A robust method for this 
parameter is still needed. 
 
The likely quality of CO
2
 measurements made in 
the future by the various PICES member 
countries thus seems assured.  Nevertheless, it 
will be essential to  
null ensure availability and distribution of 
suitable CRMs, and  
null continue regular inter-comparison exercises 
to guarantee that all laboratories that are 
making oceanic CO
2
 measurements are 
capable of such high-quality measurements. 
 
  
Appendix C. 
Results of Working Group 13 data integration workshops 
 
A necessity to identify available and suitable 
data sets on the oceanic CO
2
 system and 
recommend the mechanisms of data and 
information exchange was explicitly included in 
the terms of reference at the establishment of the 
PICES Working Group 13 on CO
2
 in the North 
Pacific.  At the international North Pacific CO
2
 
Data Synthesis Symposium, co-sponsored by 
PICES and the JST/CREST Program and hosted 
by the National Institute of Environmental 
Studies in October 2000, in Tsukuba, Japan, a 
need to discuss the procedures for developing a 
North Pacific CO
2
 database was re-instated.  It 
was agreed that this project should be the 
primary activity of the Working Group during 
2001, and in coordination with the PICES 
Technical Committee on Data Exchange, two 
workshops should be held in this direction to: 
null review status of national/international CO
2
 
data inventories;  
null discuss technical aspects involved in the 
development of a common database for CO
2
 
and CO
2
-related data;  and 
null outline a possible mechanism for the 
international cooperation needed to realize 
this. 
 
The first CO
2
 Data Planning Workshop was held 
January 22-24, 2001, at the Institute of Ocean 
Sciences in Sidney, Canada (Fig. 20), to discuss 
the likely technical issues involved in 
developing of the North Pacific CO
2
 database 
and to plan a second more detailed workshop.  
The participants included both CO
2
 research 
scientists and specialists in oceanographic data 
from various Data Centers (JODC - Japan 
Oceanographic Data Center, MIRC - Marine 
Information Research Center of Japan 
Hydrographic Association, NODC - National 
Oceanographic Data Center of the United States, 
CDIAC - Carbon Dioxide Information and 
Analysis Center of the United States, and MEDS 
- Marine Environmental Data Service of 
Canada). 
 
A series of presentations reviewed the present 
status of North Pacific CO
2
 data in the 
participating PICES member countries, and 
essentially indicated that many of the recent and 
historic data holdings remain within individual 
laboratories, though steps are being undertaken 
to transfer the data to national and international 
Data Centers.  It was also noted that even when 
such data resides at the Data Centers, integrating 
them into a coherent picture is a large task which 
requires a great deal of time and expertise.  A 
common problem is that such data sets are often 
inadequately documented, making an objective 
assessment of their reliability very difficult.  The 
workshop participants thus spent time 
developing draft guidelines for metadata 
(documentation of the methods, quality control 
procedures, etc.) that should accompany 
archived CO
2
 data sets.  Although it was 
recognized that in a number of cases, this 
information was perhaps unavailable, it was felt 
that such guidelines would help Data Centers to 
better assess the comprehensiveness of the 
metadata accompanying their data products.  
However, ultimately the most important part of 
the workshop was the opportunity it gave the 
participants to articulate a long-range vision for 
the future of CO
2
 data sets for the North Pacific, 
and suggest approaches for the international 
coordination and cooperation needed to 
implement it. 
 
To make the integration of both historic and 
future North Pacific CO
2
-related data a reality, 
the workshop participants recommend that the 
Working Group 13 and TCODE: 
null Work together with the Data Centers 
(JODC, MIRC, NODC, CDIAC, MEDS, 
etc.) and the JGOFS North Pacific Task 
Team to compile an international North 
Pacific data inventory for CO
2
 and CO
2
-
related data, to be available as a web site by 
MIRC, and mirrored at the other Data 
Centers.  Priority should be given to North 
Pacific open-ocean data;  however, marginal 
seas will also be included.

for future replicate and shore-based analysis 
of deep-water samples, and to encourage the 
re-sampling of these stations in future 
national and international North Pacific CO

surveys.  This would aid the assessment of 
the quality and utility of the historical 
databases. 
null Use the quality-checked historical surface 
ocean pCO
2
, data from Japan, Canada and 
the United States to test the Live Access 
Server concept for the display and 
distribution of combined data sets via the 
Internet. 
null Promote the development of near real-time 
data exchange/data integration approaches 
for underway pCO
2
, measurements in 
preparation for future observational 
programs, to ensure that timely repeated 
assessments of CO
2
 exchange can be made.

2
 
inter-comparison studies to test the 
comparability of pCO
2
 methods. 
 
The second CO
2
 Data Integration Workshop 
held at the Japan Oceanographic Data Center 
  
(Tokyo, Japan) from July 31 to August 2, 2001, 
aimed at (i) developing strategies for the 
exchange of CO
2
 and related data at the 
international level;  and (ii) examining in more 
detail, the technical issues in integrating 
presently available data into a uniform data 
structure or database.  Again this workshop was 
attended by a variety of PICES scientists and 
managers from existing Data Centers.  The 
participants further explored the combined data 
set and debated a strategy for assessment and 
correction of systematic discrepancies.  They 
also evaluated a proposed common data format 
and discussed the future home for a North 
Pacific database and plans for its accessibility. 
 
A number of issues were agreed on at this 
meeting: 
null a draft data format for future CO
2
 data; 
null the importance and success of the PICNIC 
(PICES CO
2
 Related Data Integration for the 
North Pacific) data inventory developed by 
MIRC and now available on line at 
http://picnic.pices.jp;  This web site 
incorporates the extensive information about 
Japanese cruises and information about 
Canadian (IOS) and U. S. cruises (linked to 
CDIAC holdings).  At present, the inventory 
is linked to original data (at other locations 
on the Internet) wherever practical, and 
serves various historical data sets as they are 
digitized.  However work is in progress to 
host some datasets at MIRC; 
null the use of the Live Access Server (LAS) 
approach to serve distributed data sets so as 
to provide for improved data visualization 
over the Internet, and an agreement to share 
technical expertise to ensure this could be 
achieved;  and  
null the need to continue this project in future 
years. 
 
Both workshops met their goals, and PICES now 
has a unified plan for submission and exchange 
of CO
2
 and CO
2
-related data at the international 
level.  This work will be continued by the 
PICES Working Group 17 on Biogeochemical 
data integration and synthesis, established in 
2002, to retain a scientific focus on the carbon 
cycle within PICES.  The Working Group 17 
declared collating historical, present day and 
future CO
2
, carbon isotope and hydrographic 
data into an internationally accessible North 
Pacific database as one of its key activities.  This 
effort will be conducted in collaboration with the 
existing national and international Data Centers 
and the Ocean Carbon Coordination Project of a 
joint IGBP/IHDP/WCRP Global Carbon Project.
