EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
A workshop was convened by the MODEL Task Team and held June 23-28, 1996, in Nemuro, 
Japan, to develop the modeling requirements of the PICES Climate Change and Carrying Capacity 
(CCCC) Program.  It was attended by over 40 scientists from all member nations of PICES.  The principal 
objectives of the workshop were to  
 
• review the roles and limitations of modeling for the CCCC program; 
• propose the level of modeling required;  and 
• provide a plan for how to promote these modeling activities. 
 
Secondary activities at the workshop included organisational meetings of the Regional comparisons 
(REX) and Basin-scale experiment (BASS) Task Teams, and a symposium by Japan-GLOBEC on 
“Development and application of new technologies for measurement and modeling in marine 
ecosystems.” 
 
This report serves as a record of the proceedings of this workshop.  It includes the texts of the 
invited state-of-the-art overviews of atmosphere-ocean modeling, lower trophic level models, upper 
trophic level models, and model integration and management issues.  Discussion groups were formed on 
each of these overview topics to consider the status of relevant models, identification of boundary 
conditions and interactions, model evaluation, and roles in process and observational studies; reports from 
each of these groups are included in these workshop proceedings.  Also included is a report of MODEL 
Task Team meetings at the end of the workshop and just prior to the fifth Annual PICES meeting, in 
which the workshop results are distilled into a plan for action regarding CCCC modeling activities.  
Summaries of the Japan-GLOBEC symposium and reports of national GLOBEC activities in member 
nations are included as appendices. 
 
The workshop underlined the central role of models in the CCCC program.  Models serve to 
extrapolate retrospective and new observations through space and time, assist with the design of 
observational programs, and test our understanding of the integration and functioning of ecosystem 
components.  Clear differences were identified in the level of advancement of the various disciplinary 
models.  Atmosphere-ocean and physical circulation models are the most advanced, to the extent that 
existing models are generally useful now for CCCC objectives, at least on the Basin scale.  Circulation 
models in territorial and regional seas are presently more varied in their level of development, and may 
need some co-ordination from PICES.  Lower trophic level models are advancing, and examples of their 
application coupled with large-scale circulation models are beginning to appear.  There is a need for 
comparisons of specific physiological models, and for grafting of detailed mixed layer models into the 
general circulation models.  With upper trophic level models, there are several well-developed models for 
specific applications, but workshop participants felt there were as yet no leading models available for 
general use within the CCCC program.  This is an area that needs particular attention and encouragement 
from PICES. 
 
Participants at the workshop strongly endorsed the view that modeling for the CCCC program 
should take place as distributed activities at several locations rather than be a highly centralised effort.  
This introduces problems of co-ordination and capabilities for integration of component sub-models, 
which need to be resolved by the CCCC program.  There was no support for efforts to standardize models 
or model approaches within the CCCC program at this time, believing that diversity in assumptions and 
techniques will lead to faster advances in the North Pacific region.  There was strong support for the need 
to compare and contrast models for similar areas to understand the reasons for possibly different results. 
 
 
iv
As a result of the workshop, the MODEL Task Team proposed the following plan for action over 
the next 1-2 years: 
 
• make published circulation models results for the North Pacific widely available to the scientific 
community, preferably representing conditions before and after 1977;  and provide a meta-analysis of 
available circulation models in the regional seas; 
• compare specific lower trophic level physiological models and conduct a meta-analysis of upper 
mixed layer models suitable for grafting into general circulation models; 
• encourage awareness and comparative applications of upper trophic level models for the North 
Pacific, and work to identify potential leading models; 
• develop recommendations for facilitating linkages among component sub-models; 
• interact with the developing retrospective and observational programs of the BASS and REX Task 
Teams of the CCCC program.

Background 
 
Inspired by recent scientific findings on the 
climate variability in the North Pacific, PICES has 
established a science program on climate 
variability and its consequences in the North 
Pacific area in conjunction with International 
GLOBEC.  The program was named Climate 
Change and Carrying Capacity (CCCC).  In 1994, 
during the Third Annual Meeting of PICES, a 
workshop was organized to develop a Science 
Plan.  The Science Plan was approved at the 
PICES Fifth Annual Meeting in 1995.  In 1995, an 
Implementation Panel was established, which 
reviewed the Science Plan and developed it into an 
Implementation Plan (PICES Scientific Rep. No. 
4, 1996).   
 
The Goal of PICES/CCCC is to address how 
climate variability affects ecosystem structure and 
the productivity of key biological species at all 
trophic levels in the open ocean and coastal North 
Pacific ecosystems (PICES Scientific Rep. No. 4, 
1996).  The relevant time scales are seasons-to-
centuries, i.e., quasi-biennial, ENSO, bi-decadal, 
and near-centennial.  The studies will be 
conducted at two spatial scales:  basin-scale 
studies, which include the open, deep waters of the 
North Pacific, and regional-scale comparative 
ecosystem studies.  Two basin ecosystems and ten 
coastal ecosystems are defined in the North 
Pacific.  
 
In the Implementation Plan, four Central Scientific 
Issues are identified, which is a restatement of the 
eight Key Scientific Questions addressed in the 
Science Plan: 
 
• Physical forcing:  What are the charac-teristics 
of climate variability, can inter-decadal 
patterns be identified, how and when do they 
arise? 
• Lower trophic level response:  How do 
primary and secondary producers respond in 
productivity, and in species and size 
composition, to climate variability in different 
ecosystems of the subarctic Pacific? 
• Higher trophic level response:  How do life 
history patterns, distributions, vital rates, and 
population dynamics of higher trophic level 
species respond directly and indirectly to 
climate variability? 
• Ecosystem interactions:  How are subarctic 
Pacific ecosystems structured?  Do higher 
trophic levels respond to climate variability 
solely as a consequence of bottom-up forcing?  
Are there significant inter-trophic level and 
top-down effects on lower trophic level 
production and on energy transfer 
efficiencies? 
 
To answer the Central Scientific Issues, five Key 
Research Activities are planned: retrospective 
analysis, model studies, process studies, 
observation systems, and data management.  Of 
these, model studies play a central role in that they 
draw upon the findings of retrospective analyses 
and guide the process studies and observation 
systems (Fig. 1.1).  As such, model activities are 
expected to be initiated in the early phase of the 
CCCC implementation. 
 
In 1995, three task teams were formed to pursue 
the goals specified in the Implementation Plan: 
MODEL (modeling studies), BASS (basin scale 
studies), and REX (regional experiments).  Of 
these, the MODEL  task team is concerned with 
advancing the development of conceptual/ 
theoretical and modeling studies needed for both 
regional and basin scale components of CCCC.  
During the Fourth Annual Meeting it was 
approved to hold a workshop on the 
conceptual/theoretical studies as an initiating 
activity to implement the CCCC program.   
 
The Objectives and Organization of the 
Workshop  
 
The major objective of the workshop was to 
develop the MODEL-related requirements of the 
 
 
2
CCCC Implementation Plan and, as an outcome, to 
produce a work plan that will further the goal of 
the CCCC Program.  In addition, other activities 
relevant to the CCCC program were conducted 
during the workshop.  One was to review the 
present GLOBEC plans and activities in each of 
the PICES member nations.  Another was to 
develop work plans for BASS and REX.  A 
symposium organized by the Japan-GLOBEC 
committee was also held to review new 
technologies relevant to observational studies and 
model development. 
 
For the MODEL workshop, four focal topics were 
defined corresponding to the Central Scientific 
Issues: Physical Forcing, Lower Trophic Level 
Responses, Higher Trophic Level Responses, and 
Model Integration/Management.  The fourth focal 
topic was an amalgamation of ecosystem response 
and data management topics from the 
Implementation Plan. 
 
Based on this division, a review of the state-of-
the-art of modeling activities in each of the four 
topics was made by invited experts, after which 
the participants were grouped into four discussion 
groups based on these four topics. During the 
discussion group deliberations, each group 
reviewed the role and nature of modeling activities 
relevant to its topic.  Some of the common 
questions considered were: 
• What would be the appropriate level of 
modeling?   
• What kind of models are to be used? 
• What is the limitation of models? 
• How should we define boundaries? 
• What are the requirements for BASS and REX 
studies? 
• What will be the common strategy for regional 
study models? 
• What is the relation of MODEL with other 
activities?  In other words, what is needed 
from retrospective studies?  How to aid the 
process studies? 
• What kind of observation system is needed for 
validation and data assimilation? 
 
Each group also discussed scientific, technical, 
and methodological issues.  These included:  
• Structure of models, e.g., important factors 
and processes 
• Crucial processes and parameters that need 
most attention 
• Required information flow between model 
components 
• Development, integration and management of 
models 
• Data assimilation 
• Exchange and sharing of software 
 
As a result, recommendations were made for 
requirements and priority of action for the 
MODEL Task Team. Although not fully completed 
at the time, these discussion group comments and 
recommendations formed the basis for a meeting 
of the MODEL Task Team members towards the 
end of the workshop, which produced an initial 
plan of action.  
 
This report serves as a record of the proceedings 
of this workshop.  It includes the invited state-of-
the-art reviews, the discussion group reports, the 
report of the MODEL task team meeting, synopses 
of the national GLOBEC reports, and the report of 
the Japan-GLOBEC symposium.

2. AN OVERVIEW OF ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN MODELING OF THE 
NORTH PACIFIC

Abstract 
 
Background information on numerical models of 
the circulation of the North Pacific has recently 
been presented in the report of PICES Working 
Group 7.  This presentation highlights some of the 
more important points of that report and draws 
attention to some features of particular relevance 
to the CCCC program. 
 
Introduction 
 
The physical and chemical properties of the ocean 
affect all aspects of life in that medium.  These 
properties vary with time as they are subject to 
atmospheric forcing and redistribution of the 
ocean's waters.  A description of the ocean's 
properties, and particularly of their changes in 
time and space, is fundamental to an 
understanding of changes in the oceanic 
ecosystem.  This presentation reviews some of the 
highlights of models which describe and explain 
oceanic variability in the North Pacific, while 
commenting on some of their successes and 
limitations and drawing attention to their 
sensitivity to initial and boundary conditions. 
 
Model features 
 
Models are simplified formal representations of 
nature.  They use simple rules (in our case, the 
equations of fluid motion), consider a limited 
selection of variables, and have only limited 
resolution.  They are used as tests of 
understanding, providing a comparison between 
their predictions and observations.  They may also 
be used to assess the impact of changes in 
conditions and, when reliable enough, as 
predictors of future states.  
 
Atmospheric and ocean circulation models share a 
number of features.  They usually discretize spatial 
variations in terms of vertical layers (or levels) and 
cut up the horizontal plane into squares or 
triangular elements.  Effects taking place on scales 
smaller than these grids may have an effect on 
larger scales which is represented by parametric 
approximations. For example, mixing by various 
kinds of eddying motions is commonly 
approximated in this fashion.  
 
Initial and boundary conditions have a strong 
influence on the solutions of numerical models, as 
should be expected.  Models are run for long times 
to try to eliminate the effects of uncertainties in 
their starting conditions.  Boundary conditions for 
ocean models include forcing by the wind and 
other surface fluxes, as well as flow in and out of 
model boundaries from other parts of the ocean.  
Efforts to minimize the effects of boundary 
conditions lead to global models, where there are 
no other parts of the ocean to consider, and to 
coupled ocean-atmosphere models, wherein both 
fluids are included.  
 
Model performance must be evaluated against 
observations.  Numerical models however yield 
much more information than is available from 
data.  That discrepancy between what we can 
calculate theoretically and what we really know is 
always a difficulty! 
 
Model performance 
 
The most sophisticated model of North Pacific 
circulation is probably at this time the Navy 
Research Laboratory's high resolution model as 
described by Hurlburt et al. (1996).  The realistic 
computations of the Kuroshio-Oyashio region, 
including the double front structure and the 
presence of numerous warm-core eddies 
(described most lately by Talley et al. 1995) 
between them is an encouraging result (cf. PICES 
Report No. 5, 1996).  Similarly, the close 
comparison of sea-levels predicted by the NRL 
model and observations of sea-level at Sitka, on 
 
 
4
the other side of the North Pacific, is also 
enheartening (Melsom et al., 1995; cf also PICES 
1996).   
 
On the other hand, comparisons of model results 
with observed WOCE drifters are not quite as 
satisfying.  A NRL simulation of the path of a 
WOCE drifter is no better than the much simpler 
OSCURS model described in Fig. 31 of PICES 
1996.  Very complicated, and physically more 
complete models of the North Pacific circulation 
are not more successful at predicting surface 
circulation than a semi-empirical model...a 
sobering result!  
 
Time-scales of predictability 
 
As outlined in Table 1 of PICES 1996, 
predictability of oceanic phenomena depends on 
the physical properties of the feature of interest.  
Features directly related to weather-scale 
atmospheric forcing will, of course, be no more 
predictable than the weather itself. Other features, 
associated perhaps with El Niño or other long-
period phenomena may have longer prediction 
scales. Decadal or longer scales of ocean 
variability are identifiable in nature as well as in 
model output (Yukimoto et al., 1996).  The inertia 
of property transfers by diffusion or drift controls 
many longer scale processes related to water-mass 
formation.  
 
Scales of variability in the North Pacific are first 
of all seasonal, and then interannual at the time 
scale of the ENSO.  Relations between tropical 
and higher latitude phenomena are prominent in 
models and in observations at the ENSO time-
scale as well as at longer time scales (Yukimoto et 
al., 1996).  Whether the decadal variations 
described by Trenberth and Herrell (1994) are best 
interpreted as "regime shifts" as Francis and Hare 
(1994) and others have proposed, or as less abrupt 
long-period variations, remains a matter of 
interpretation.  Genuine oceanic regime shifts 
certainly deserve more explicit documentation.  A 
regime shift seems to imply an inner change, 
perhaps in the detailed dynamics of a system, and 
not just a shift in some of its properties.  It is 
encouraging to find that long period variability in 
sea surface temperature produced by the Yukimoto 
et al. (1996) model shows a similar pattern to that 
observed by Thomson and Tabata (1989) at Station 
P.  
 
The variability of oceanic conditions, as mirrored 
by model output, presents serious problems for 
observational verification.  Even integrated 
quantities, such as meridional heat flux, show 
factor-of-two interannual variations.  For example, 
the global coupled model of Russell et al. (1995) 
gives an average northward heat flux of about 1.5 
petawatts across 16°N, but at least nine years of 
model output must be averaged to obtain a stable 
estimate.  Will a meaningful comparison with 
observations then require an observational time 
series of comparable duration?  If so, will the 
WOCE observational program have been 
sufficient?  
 
Sensitivity to initial and boundary conditions 
 
A number of examples presented in PICES 1996 
illustrate the dependence of model results on 
boundary conditions and model structure.  Fig 11 
in that report illustrates the differences in the path 
and meandering of the Kuroshio in different types 
of models.  Fig. 30 shows the sensitivity of model 
results in the same region to the particular wind-
stress field used to drive the ocean. 
 
The major concern of the PICES CCCC program 
is the response of the North Pacific ecosystem to 
climate change. Beyond natural long-term 
variability, climate change is also linked to the 
increase in atmospheric CO
2
 concentration.  
Simulated changes in surface temperature due to a 
doubling of CO
2 
are largest in high northern 
latitudes.  Boer (1996) shows increases of up to 
8°C in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas.  The 
extensive ice cover in these regions may be 
strongly modified by a warming trend.  
Interannual variability in the extent of ice cover 
may in turn affect global warming trends.  There 
remains some doubt as to the magnitude of the 
expected warming. 
 
The lesson is that one must remain careful in using 
results of climate models and refrain from drawing 
 
 
5
apocalyptic conclusions about their potential 
effects on the oceanic ecosystem. 
 
Model development and ecosystem applications 
 
One may distinguish four stages in the 
development and improvement of models.  These 
stages apply just as well to ecosystem as to 
hydrodynamic models. The first stage is the 
identification of significant variables and essential 
processes, followed by the formulation of a simple 
model.  The second stage consists of a first 
comparison of the results with observations, 
identification of discrepancies and refinement of 
the model.  At the next stage, observations and 
model results are linked through a thorough 
statistical analysis which allows optimal control of 
model parameters.  Finally, error analyses are 
performed and the model is analyzed for its 
predictive capacities.  
 
Atmospheric circulation models have progressed 
through all these stages, driven by the high quality 
requirements of practical weather prediction.  
Except for models strictly restricted to tides, 
oceanic circulation models are generally less 
advanced.  Because biological and chemical 
effects usually do not significantly affect the 
dynamics of the ocean, it is appropriate to develop 
ocean circulation models independently of 
subsequent applications to ecosystem modeling.  
 
Conclusions 
 
There continues to be rapid progress in ocean 
circulation modeling.  The impetus for better 
models of coastal areas derives from a variety of 
concerns, e.g., water quality, fish migrations, 
navigation.  Ocean-wide models and deep 
circulation models are mostly of concern to 
climate studies.  Model development will proceed 
regardless of PICES interests and it would seem 
most effective to devote PICES efforts towards its 
own specific objectives of developing ecosystem 
models. 
 
The best models have been developed in areas rich 
in observations.  Model verification and testing 
against real data is the surest road to reliability. 
Model results must be made understandable and 
unambiguously clear to all who are interested in 
their applications.  Visualization methods and 
other ways of enhancing the impact of the results 
should be strongly encouraged. 
 
Finally, the most effective way to hasten model 
development and improvements may be to apply 
them to real problems, where there are people and 
organizations who are likely to benefit personally 
from model results. Effort should be made to 
disseminate model results beyond the scientific 
and government community to those (fishermen, 
environmentalists, etc...) who may have an 
emotional commitment to the nature of the results.

3. SOME COMMENTS ON LOWER TROPHIC LEVEL MODELING 
 
Michio J. Kishi, Ocean Research Institute, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan 
 
Many kinds of numerical models have been 
proposed in order to investigate models for 
understanding the processes that govern the cycling 
of biological material in the ocean.  However, most 
of them are based on Fasham's JGOFS model 
(Fasham et al., 1993) and focused on the ecosystem 
of Atlantic. 
 
We (Kawamiya et al., 1995) made a numerical 
model to simulate the trophodynamics of ocean 
station Papa, which includes a 1-D physical model 
with Mellor and Yamada's closure scheme (level 2) 
for the vertical diffusion coefficient.  The results 
showed good agreement with the time series of 
observations of biological and physical 
compartments, especially of the spring bloom, fall 
bloom, and yearly primary production (about 130 g 
C m
-2
 y
-1
) in 1980. 
 
This kind of 1-D model has been investigated by, 
e.g., Radach and Moll (1993), Franks and Marra 
(1994) and Doney et al. (1996).  Doney et al.(1996) 
applied their model to the BATS data set. So, our 
model was also applied to BATS data and the results 
were satisfactory. 
  
Generally speaking, any ecosystem model can 
follow the time evolution of chlorophyll 
concentration if the physical model in which the 
ecosystem model is involved is made to follow the 
mixed layer mechanism.  So, the ecosystem model 
must follow the time series of nutrients, new 
production, and/or yearly production. 
  
I want to comment that the small differences in the 
equations which describe the material flows among 
compartments (for example, Fasham et al. (1993) 
and Kawamiya et al. (1994) use the same 
formulation for nitrogen uptake but different ones 
for the P-I curve, Kawamiya et al. (1994) and Doney 
et al. (1996) use the same formulation for the P-I 
curve but different ones for nutrient uptake, etc.) 
cause the giant differences in the results of the 
calculations. It is well known that zooplankton 
equations define the steady state solution of 
phytoplankton (not the phytoplankton equations) if 
we use a linear formulation for zooplankton 
mortality.  These kinds of mathematical problems 
(what is effective on steady state solutions, 
uniquenes of solutions, existence of solutions, 
stability of solutions and so on) must be taken into 
consideration when we construct ecosystem 
equations as there are no exact formulations (like 
Newton's equations in dynamics) in ecosystems.

CLIMATE CHANGE ON UPPER TROPHIC LEVEL SPECIES

Introduction 
 
When considering what types of models to include 
in this review, it seems critical to examine models 
that explicitly consider the mechanisms by which 
climate can affect upper trophic level species.  
There are possibilities for direct and indirect 
pathways through which climate change effects 
are transferred to upper trophic level species.  One 
conceptual model of these pathways is that of 
Francis et al. (1995) wherein the main effect of 
physical change is through a bottom-up path 
starting at primary production and working its way 
up through the trophic levels.  This conceptual 
model also explicitly recognizes that temperature 
change will directly affect process rates and 
distribution and availability of prey at all trophic 
levels.  These are the pathways and physical 
variables that can influence change but what are 
the mechanisms for change? 
 
A conceptual model that contains the main 
biological processes to be considered when trying 
to understand climate change effects on any upper 
trophic level species is depicted in DeAngelis et 
al. (1991).  Although their model was developed 
specifically for understanding density-dependent 
effects on a population, the main processes of 
reproduction, growth (and consumption), survival, 
and movement are all potentially affected directly 
or indirectly by climate change.  A detailed 
conceptual diagram of climate variables and their 
connections to biological processes for a fish 
population (DOE, 1985 in Glantz, 1992), 
illustrates how many different variables and 
processes can be involved in an explicit model of 
climate change effects on an upper trophic level 
species.  There are no existing models that include 
all of these linkages between physical factors and 
biological processes for even a single marine 
species.  There are many models, however, that 
contain some explicit detail of one or more 
important processes for one or more life stages of 
an upper trophic level species. 
 
The following review summarizes models which 
include some of physical and biological factors 
thought to influence the important biological 
processes of reproduction, growth, consumption/ 
predation, movement, and ultimately the survival 
of upper trophic level species.  Because different 
mechanisms may regulate the survival process at 
different life history stages, models which could 
be considered state-of-the-art for a given life 
history stage are reviewed first, then models which 
include all life history stages and even multiple 
species.   
 
Although there is definitely a role for minimal (or 
strategic) models (Scheffer and Beets, 1994) in 
identifying climate change effects on upper trophic 
level species (e.g., Collie and Spencer, 1994; 
Pascual and Adkison, 1994; Butterworth and 
Thomson, 1995; York, 1995), these models are 
more of a first step in the model-building process.  
Also, on the other end of the spectrum, some of 
the large-scale simulation models developed 
mainly in the 1970's may have contained too many 
processes and parameters to be estimated from 
admittedly sparse data (e.g., Parrish, 1975; 
Andersen and Ursin, 1977; Laevastu and Larkins, 
1981).  The current state-of-the-art upper-trophic 
levels models are somewhere in the middle of 
these two extremes and are strengthened by the 
existence of more data for parameterization and 
validation.  These recent models being developed  
might be called tactical models (Figure 4.1) and 
are usually designed to answer specific questions 
using a mechanistic approach (DeAngelis, 1988).  
Those taking this approach believe that in order 
for a model to be predictive it must include the 
correct mechanisms operating in a system.  
Therefore, this review is limited to population 
models that explicitlyconsider at least one or more 
of the mechanisms affecting recruitment, growth, 
 
 
3
consumption/predation.  Also not included here 
are models with longer-time scales where genetic 
change and evolution of species-level traits are 
considered, although development of these types 
of models would be important.  Finally, upper-
trophic level species are considered to be those 
above the second trophic level.  I will attempt to 
use examples of models that consider the 
stereotypical marine upper trophic level species: 
larval, juvenile and adult fish, and marine birds 
and mammals. 
 
Early-life history models 
 
Early-life history models, particularly for larval 
marine fish, tend to focus on the transport process 
as a way of testing Hjort’s (1914) critical period 
hypothesis.  This hypothesis assumes that most 
larval fish mortality is due to starvation and that 
factors that lead to successful larval feeding and 
growth are important for survival.  Because 
advection of eggs and larvae to areas of favorable 
temperature and food availability is considered a 
primary mechanism determining successful larval 
feeding and growth in a marine environment, most 
early life history models of fish center on 
predicting larval transport via wind-driven 
currents.   
 
Several early life history survival models have 
been developed for various North Pacific species 
including English sole, Parophrys vetulus, (Kruse 
and Tyler, 1989; Walters et al., 1992), walleye 
pollock, Theragra chalcogramma, (Walsh and 
McRoy 1986; Hinckley et al. 1996), sardine, 
Sardinops melanostictus, (Kasai et al., 1995), and 
red king crab, Paralithodes camtschatica, (Hsu 
and Armstrong, 1988).  Some of these (e.g., Kasai 
et al., 1995) apply differential survival rates to 
larvae depending on their location.  Others include 
more detail about temperature-dependent growth 
processes and vertical movement (Hinckley et al., 
1996) and food availability (Walsh et al., 1981; 
Walters et al., 1992).  The effect of variability in 
the timing and location of reproduction on larval 
transport and resulting survival can also be 
explored.  Models that explicitly included food 
availability (e.g., Walsh and McRoy, 1986) 
concluded that this was the key factor influencing 
survival.  Others that included details on events 
prior to spawning (Kruse and Tyler, 1989), 
however, found that those factors were also very 
important.  Most state-of-the-art models of early 
life history survival tend to be individual-based 
models (IBM’s), where the characteristics of each 
individual animal are tracked through time (Van 
Winkle et al., 1993).  The planned additions to the 
model of Hinckley et al. (1996), such as prey 
abundance from a nutrient-phytoplankton-
zooplankton model and a turbulence/ feeding 
success rate relationship will make it a state-of-
the-art model for early life history survival of 
marine fish. 
 
Although I was unable to find any detailed models 
specifically of early life history survival of marine 
mammals and birds, processes that influence food 
availability to lactating female marine mammals or 
to adult birds caring for chicks would be 
important.  Also, thermal budget analysis of 
northern fur seal pups (Callorhinus ursinus L.) by 
Trites (1990) indicated that low birth weight pups 
would be susceptible to certain environmental 
extremes in air temperature, wind speed, and 
humidity during the first week of life.  Marine bird 
chicks would also be susceptible to exposure 
mortality in early life history stages.  Aside from 
larval transport, many of the other processes (e.g., 
timing of adult migration for reproduction, climate 
during the first few weeks of life, and temperature 
and food dependent growth) included in larval fish 
growth and survival models could be used to 
model early life history survival of marine 
mammals and birds.   
 
Juvenile and adult upper trophic level models 
 
Most models that consider climate effects on 
juveniles and adults of a single upper trophic level 
species tend to focus on consumption, growth, and 
migration processes, either singly or in concert.   
 
The effects of surface currents on salmon 
migration rates and return times are being 
investigated with an ocean surface current model 
in which salmon are included as passive drifters 
during their non-directed ocean phase and as 
active drifters during their return migration phase 
 
 
4
(Thomson et al., 1994).  It was concluded that 
interannual variability in surface currents could 
affect the return times of Fraser river sockeye by 
up to 1.5 weeks, an amount more than three times 
the standard deviation around the peak return dates 
of several Fraser river stocks.   
 
Another salmon model in progress relates to 
developing a measure of available thermal habitat 
for each North Pacific salmon species (Welch, 
1995).  This appears to be similar to the work of 
Stefan et al. (1995), in which the amount of lake 
habitat available for good fish growth is estimated 
under the present temperature regime and under a 
climate warming regime.  In addition to a global 
warming model, this estimation requires species-
specific estimates of lower and upper temperatures 
for good growth, upper lethal temperature, and 
optimum temperature.  These models predict large 
decreases in the area of good growth habitat for 
cold-water fish which would presumably result in 
decreases in actual growth rates.  However, these 
models do not actually show how much of the 
good growth area is currently being used and there 
is no direct linkage to predicting changes in fish 
growth. 
 
A more explicit model of climate change effects on 
sockeye salmon growth has been developed by 
Hinch et al. (1995).  Salmon are assumed to 
achieve their temperature-dependent maximum 
daily ration and move through fixed monthly 
positions in the Northeast Pacific Ocean.  This 
model predicts a 14% reduction in average final 
ocean weight if sea surface temperatures increase 
by 3.5°C when atmospheric CO
2
 doubles.   
 
A model of salmon migration and consumption 
that takes into consideration salmon active 
migrations as a function of currents and 
temperature and migrations due to food 
availability and temperature limits, is the model of 
Favorite and Laevastu (1979).  This model also 
considers growth as a function of temperature and 
food availability.  It  was able to reproduce the 
offshore distribution of salmon.  However, more 
complete validation and refinement of the model 
never proceeded any further. 
 
These above models are approaching some of the 
complexity used in spatial models of freshwater 
salmon and other pelagic fish growth potential 
(Goyke and Brandt, 1993; Mason and Patrick, 
1993).  Included in these models are more detailed 
bioenergetics relating to direct temperature effects 
on growth, prey availability effects on growth and 
vertical movements based on minimizing predator 
encounter rate and maximizing feeding rate.  
Combining these spatial models of fish growth 
potential with a more detailed model of salmon 
migration, perhaps similar to that of Thomson et 
al. (1994), and information on prey availability 
would provide a state-of-the-art model of juvenile 
and adult growth of salmon.  
 
It is apparent that a state-of-the-art model of the 
effects of climate change on juvenile and adult 
upper trophic level predator growth may require a 
model of bioenergetics that describes how 
juveniles and adult metabolic requirements and 
growth change as a function of temperature and 
food intake.  These models range from those that 
predict growth changes directly as a function of 
temperature (Stevens, 1990) to those that include 
detailed equations for different components of 
metabolism such as standard metabolism, activity, 
and digestion of food (e.g., Hewett and Johnson, 
1992 for fish; Oritsland and Markussen, 1990 for 
mammals). 
 
Feeding migrations may also need to be a 
significant component of  models developed for 
juvenile and adult upper trophic level predators.  
Presently, most of the feeding migration models do 
not explicitly include temperature or currents as a 
factor influencing movement.  Those for mammals 
and birds tend to include a directional and distance 
component from the colony or rookery (Ford et 
al., 1982; French et al., 1989; Agnew and Phagan, 
1995).  Although pattern-matching movement 
rules are easiest to implement, they limit the type 
of questions that models with those rules can 
address (Tyler and Rose, 1994).  The simulation of 
fish migrations developed by Laevastu and 
Larkins (1981) includes a predetermined migration 
speed and direction for seasonal migration and a 
diffusion component for movement away from 
areas of unfavorable temperature and food 
 
 
5
availability.  This model was able to qualitatively 
reproduce observed summer distribution patterns 
of some Bering Sea groundfish species in cold and 
warm years (Pola, 1985).  This effort is a 
movement toward more process-based movement 
rules that appear to be needed in spatial models 
that address the effects of climate change on upper 
trophic level species.  
 
Full life cycle models 
 
There is an apparent scarcity of full life cycle 
models for upper trophic level species, particularly 
in marine environments.  There are some models 
that simulate the bioenergetics of all life-history 
stages of a population (e.g., Wiens and Innis, 
1974; Ford et al., 1982; Swartzman et al., 1982), 
but only through one year or feeding season. The 
scarcity of full-life cycle models that include a 
feedback loop of adult life history events including 
reproduction through to early life history survival 
events  is perhaps due to the different modeling 
strategies used for modeling early life history 
stages versus juvenile and adult stages.  
Individual-based models where the state of each 
individual is tracked through time, i-space 
configuration models, tend to be used most 
frequently for early life history models of growth 
and survival (Van Winkle et al., 1993).  However, 
for juvenile and adult life history stages where 
multiple generations are often being modelled and 
the data may take the form of average values and 
variances, an i-space distribution model may be 
more appropriate (DeAngelis and Rose, 1992).  
Instead of tracking attributes such as size for each 
individual, an i-space distribution model might 
specify a size-frequency distribution for 
individuals within a certain age or size class.  
Some other models may aggregate even further, 
considering only the total number or biomass 
within an age group or of the whole adult or 
juvenile population.  Thus, it may be more 
appropriate to link outputs of separate early life 
history models and juvenile/adult models than to 
attempt building a single model for the full life 
cycle of an organism. 
 
 
Multiple-species models 
 
Most of the recent efforts incorporating multiple 
upper-trophic level species in a single model have 
taken a step back from the multispecies models 
developed in the late 1970's and 1980's (e.g., 
Parrish, 1975;  Andersen and Ursin, 1977;  
Laevastu and Larkins, 1981).  The latter two 
models each contained over ten upper-trophic 
level species.  In these earlier models and in most 
of  the multispecies models now being developed, 
such as Bogstad et al. (1992), Robinson and Ware 
(1994), Bryant et al. (1995), and Stefansson and 
Palsson (1995) the focus has been on fish as the 
main upper trophic level species.  If marine 
mammals and/or birds are included, they are 
modelled less dynamically and the focus has been 
on some of the main spatial and trophic 
interactions of commercially important fish 
resources in an area. 
 
Three of the recent modeling efforts are relatively 
similar in approach:  the fish population module of 
the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model 
(ERSEM) (Bryant et al., 1995) of the North Sea, 
the boreal migration and consumption model of 
the oceanic region around Iceland (BORMICON) 
(Stefansson and Palsson, 1995), and the 
multispecies model of the Barents Sea 
(MULTSPEC) (Bogstad et al., 1992).  Each 
modelled region has been broken into several 
spatially defined areas and one or two main fish 
species have prescribed seasonal movement 
among the subareas.  The models include or plan 
to include a full-life cycle model for at least one 
small pelagic fish species (herring or capelin) and 
static or dynamic predators (mammals and cod) on 
the small pelagic species.  Individual growth is 
dependent upon availability of food and 
temperature and there is some attempt to prescribe 
a seasonally varying zooplankton abundance.  The 
authors of these models discuss the possibility of 
including variable migration rates, depending on 
temperature and/or other factors such as prey 
availability, but have not yet implemented such a 
modification.    
 
 
 
 
 
6
A somewhat different approach has been taken by 
Robinson and Ware (1994) in their model of 
pelagic fish and plankton trophodynamics on the 
continental shelf off Vancouver Island.  A lower 
trophic level model of nutrients, phytoplankton 
and zooplankton has been linked to an upper 
trophic level model of herring, hake, dogfish, and 
salmon.  Thus, zooplankton are modelled more 
dynamically than in the models discussed above.  
Fish migration rates in and out of the one model 
area, with the exception of dogfish, are fixed and 
there is no age structure or detailed growth model 
of the fish components.  Instead of focusing on 
details of fish population response to food 
availability, temperature, and predation, this model 
directs attention to the effects of fish predation on 
zooplankton dynamics.  They conclude that the 
migratory behavior of upper trophic level 
predators is an important process to include in 
trophodynamic models. 
 
Summary 
 
Almost all of the recent modeling efforts of upper 
trophic level species exhibit a recognition of the 
need to include spatial resolution and more 
detailed descriptions of upper trophic level species 
behavior and bioenergetics.  The modeling efforts 
in progress appear to be taking a more incremental 
approach to model-building than models built 
twenty years ago.  As noted by Sklar and Costanza 
(1991), there appears to be an inverse relationship 
between model complexity and the degree of use 
of a particular model.  Thus, many models are 
being built to answer more specific questions 
about a system than to address many, broad 
ecosystem level questions.  Although recent 
models are reduced in scope, there still are many 
uncertainties about the behavior and bioenergetics 
of upper trophic level predators (Ney, 1993).  
Nevertheless, the iterative nature of the modeling 
process involves the continual re-evaluation of the 
status of our knowledge, the design of experiments 
to improve our knowledge, and the revision of our 
models. With each iteration, we can refine our 
knowledge of the system and hopefully converge 
to a better understanding of ecosystem processes.

5. MODEL INTEGRATION AND MANAGEMENT 
 
Jerry Blackford, Plymouth Marine Laboratory, Plymouth, U.K. 
 
Introduction 
 
This paper derives from the experience of 
constructing the European Regional Seas 
Ecosystem Model (ERSEM).  This European 
Community funded project ran in two phases 
between 1990 and 1996 and involved nine 
institutes from six different countries (Fig. 5.1).  
About twenty people have made significant 
contributions to the model during the course of the 
project.  The aim was to construct a generic 
ecosystem model that included representations of 
those processes thought to be of importance to the 
ecology of temperate shelf seas, without becoming 
incomprehensibly complex.  Thus ERSEM 
combines physical, chemical and biological 
descriptions of both the pelagic and benthic 
systems, modeling the cycling of carbon and the 
nutrients:  nitrate, phosphate, ammonium and 
silicate.  It covers the full trophic range from 
primary production to higher predators (Fig. 5.2) 
including four types of phytoplankton, the 
microbial loop, zooplankton and the zoobenthos.  
 
The model may be coupled to a variety of 
hydrodynamic box models and forcing functions 
that describe a region of interest (Fig. 5.3).  The 
main developmental application has been a model 
of the North Sea, employing various spatial 
resolutions.  Other applications include a high 
resolution model of the Humber river plume and 
the simulation of a water column as it passes 
through the Orkney-Shetland gap.  The long term 
objective of the ERSEM project is to provide a 
tool for the management of the marine 
environment. 
 
The computational structure of ERSEM 
 
A number of concepts, protocols and packages 
combined to make the ERSEM project possible.  
Firstly, a decision was made to equip each 
participant with identical hardware and software.  
Although computer environment differences 
should only produce tiny variations to model 
results, it can be shown that, however infrequently, 
even minute quantitative differences can 
qualitatively affect model behaviour. Identical 
hardware and software then ensures that inter-site 
comparisons are valid. 
  
ERSEM was developed with a modular structure 
and consists of a series of inter-linked modules 
each describing one particular part of the system.  
It is a hierarchical structure in that modules for the 
higher trophic levels can be stripped off and 
replaced with say constant mortality without 
necessitating any change to the modules 
describing lower trophic levels.  This creates a 
high degree of flexibility by allowing modules to 
be added or removed depending on the level of 
detail required for the particular task in hand.  The 
development of each module, within a series of 
rules and protocols, was the responsibility of an 
expert in that particular field.  The collation of 
modules into a coherent whole was the 
responsibility of one of the institutes involved in 
the project. 
 
The set of state variables - those variables that   we 
take to define the state of the whole system at any 
one time - was another important initial decision.  
These variables are the only method by which the 
modules communicate.  It is possible to add or re-
define this set, but everyone must be aware of the 
implications for the rest of the trophic structure.  
Although with the style of coding used in the 
project, adding new state variables is not hard, it is 
at the same time not a trivial task.  It is important 
to get the initial decisions fairly correct.  The 
definition of state variables also implies the 
definition of the units used throughout the model.  
 
With probably about a dozen people at any one 
time actively developing their modules there is a 
great possibility for divergence and chaos.  To 
prevent this, whilst at the same time allowing the 
individual modellers the freedom work in the way 
they wish, the project has used the concept of the 
standard model. This is an important component of 
 
 
19
the ERSEM modeling philosophy.  Each partner at 
any one time possessed the exact same standard 
version of the model. All improvements to their 
own modules were developed in the context of the 
standard version, but in a separate test directory.  
Thus there is no need to alter the standard in the 
course of modules development.  This new or 
improved module is embedded in the standard for 
the purposes of testing.  The concept of the 
standard model also allows for the rigorous cross 
comparison of results between sites. 
 
The standard model includes the requisite code for 
one or more of the applications.  Embedded within 
the standard model is the generic model, i.e. those 
elements (essentially the ecology) that are 
common to all applications. 
 
Apart from the model itself, two other, elements 
combine to enable model development and 
simulation; a modeling tool SESAME, and lately a 
visualisation package which assists with the 
interpretation of model results.  The model itself 
consists of a series of FORTRAN subroutines (the 
modules) which communicate via a common block 
which defines the set of state variables only.  The 
model routines are responsible only for calculating 
the rates of change for each state.  
 
SESAME encodes some of the concepts detailed 
above and perhaps even more importantly it 
provides the mathematical algorithms used to 
solve the model’s system of parallel differential 
equations.  SESAME is thus responsible for the 
integration of these rates, along with model 
compilation, common block creation and the 
coupling of development modules to the standard.  
A number of parameters supplied to SESAME 
control the method of integration, maximum 
allowable rate of change and hence the time step.  
Although all processes in the model are defined 
with daily rates, SESAME will decrease the time 
step in response to potentially numerically 
unstable conditions.  SESAME also provides some 
simple graphical interfaces to the model results. 
 
The directory structure (Fig. 5.4) for the current 
version of the model illustrates some of these 
principles.  There is a directory containing the 
generic model and a number of parallel directories 
containing code for the different applications 
(humber, adriatic, north sea).  One of these has 
been expanded to show the standard model 
directory.  This contains subdirectories of forcing 
functions (force), initial conditions (initial) and 
hydrodynamics (fcm).  The standard directory 
itself contains code specific to the application, box 
definitions, boundary conditions and river inputs 
etc. When compiling the standard, which is one of 
SESAME’s menu driven functions, the generic 
directory is referenced and the standard produced 
in conjunction with the application specific code.  
 
Model development takes place in the separate 
‘test’ directories.  These are the only part of the 
directory structure with write permission. 
 
Finally, whilst the state variable names and units 
are mandatory and must be common to all sub-
routines, a number of other variable naming 
conventions have been developed.  Although not 
essential to the integrity of the model, they serve 
to give a unified feel to the programming and 
more importantly serve to make each sub-module 
readably accessible to all the project participants 
(Fig. 5.5). 
 
The development of ERSEM 
 
The concept of the standard model only makes 
sense if it has a reasonable degree of longevity. 
The standard provides a solid base from which to 
work and can’t be constantly updated in response 
to each module improvement. However neither 
can there be too long between issuing new 
standards as this would slow down model 
development. 
 
The compromise that the ERSEM group used, was 
to adopt a six monthly development cycle in 
conjunction with the twice yearly project 
workshops (Fig. 5.6). New or improved modules 
were expected to be delivered to the model co-
ordinating laboratory by a deadline approximately 
6-8 weeks prior to the workshop. These deliveries 
were expected to include not only the new module 
but also relevant documentation and a sample set 
of results.  Each new module would be 
 
 
20
individually quality assured by establishing that 
the delivered results could be reproduced, thereby 
performing an indirect check on the status of the 
standard model at the other sites, and by checking 
that the intention as stated in the documentation 
was in fact carried out by the code. When these 
checks had been successfully completed the new 
modules were combined into a new draft standard 
and a mass balance check performed.  This 
ensured that all process fluxes defined were 
correctly transferred between the relevant states.  
The overall model performance would then be 
initially assessed and compared against the 
previous version.  Should the models performance 
be acceptable it would then be released to the 
partnership for a more thorough and detailed 
assessment which would be reported on at the 
workshop.  The workshop provided a discussion 
forum in which the pros and cons of each module 
were discussed.  There would usually be one or 
two problem areas identified which were never the 
less tractable in the short term.  There would 
usually be a short period after the workshop set 
aside for these problems to be solved.  This would 
lead to a mini submission and verification process 
and eventually an official new standard release. 
 
This two or three tier process of verification is 
very important.  Although at the outset, with 
simple water column models the model was 
realisable, with the move to higher resolutions and 
more complex ecosystems it is certainly not 
possible for one individual to check the entire 
model within a reasonable amount of time.  It is 
the experience that individuals tend to judge 
models from different perspectives, and it is 
certainly very constructive if at least some in the 
group are familiar with the details of other group 
members modules. 
 
Validation of any complex model is unavoidably 
problematic.  With about fifty principal state 
variables in each of up to 360 boxes for the most 
detailed application to date, there is simply not 
enough data available to perform a full validation.  
Further at the spatial scales employed by the 
ERSEM project, measured data tends to a high 
degree of variability.  The data set assembled to 
validate ERSEM ranged from relatively 
comprehensive data sets for nutrients and 
chlorophyll to very sparse or highly derived 
indicative measurements for some of the other 
trophic groups. Qualitative decisions are to some 
extent unavoidable when assessing the relative 
merits of one model version over another. 
 
Visualisation of model results 
 
With an ever growing complex model, a 
comprehensive method of examining results and 
validating the model is of great importance.  
Although SESAME initially provided a simple 
graphical interface to the model, enormous 
impetus was given to the modeling process by the 
development of a front end tool (MOVIE) which 
utilises pv-wave macros to visualise the model 
output. This gave the possibility of complex 
graphical output, quick overview and animations 
as well as validation plots and numerical output. 
 
Summary 
 
In conclusion, the recipe for modeling success 
comprised of a consistent hardware and software 
base throughout the partnership; a modular 
approach to ecosystem functionality; coding rules 
and conventions; protocols describing model 
development and submission;  quality assurance 
and the concept of the standard model. 
 
During the six year lifetime of the project it 
became apparent that over complex coding styles 
were not advantageous, nor where attempts to 
perform serious modeling exercises within the 
context of a workshop. Such activities were better 
left to smaller workshops convened around single 
issues. 
 
The generic model has proved to be very versatile 
and capable of simulating much of the essential 
behaviour of the marine system in a number of 
applications. These have included vertically 
resolved water column models of the northern 
Adriatic, 2D models of river plumes and 2D 
stratified models of the European North Sea. Work 
is now beginning on coupling the generic ERSEM 
with fully 3D hydrodynamic models.

6. INTRODUCTION TO THE DISCUSSION GROUPS 
 
Ian Perry, Dept. of Fisheries & Oceans, Canada, Nanaimo, B.C., Canada 
 
The ultimate goal of the PICES Climate Change 
and Carrying Capacity program is to “... forecast 
the consequences of climate variability on the 
ecosystems of the subarctic Pacific"  
(PICES/GLOBEC Implemen-tation Plan, PICES 
Scientific Rep. No. 4, 1996, p. 22).  The objective 
of the MODEL Task Team is identified as "... 
advancing the development of conceptual, 
theoretical and modeling studies needed for both 
regional and basin scale components of CCCC"  
(PICES Annual Rep. 1995, p. 25).  At the end of 
this workshop, the MODEL Task Team must 
propose a work program to further the goals of the 
CCCC program, for discussion and approval by 
PICES Governing Council in October, e.g.: 
• review the roles and limitations of modeling 
for the CCCC program;  
• propose the level of modeling required,  
• provide a plan for how to get there. 
 
The goal of the Discussion Groups is to develop 
the model-related requirements of the CCCC 
Implementation Plan: 
• to identify scientific, technical, and 
methodological issues in development and 
application of models; 
• to identify requirements for model and 
theoretical studies to guide the process and 
observation studies, and to integrate the 
results, of the CCCC program. 
 
Proposed modeling activities may range from 
development of a fully coupled, spatially-explicit 
ecosystem model;  to simpler models which 
provide a framework for monitoring activities and 
comparisons of field studies; to models developed 
specifically to support individual monitoring or 
process studies.  To help focus the Discussion 
Groups, and to provide common elements to the 
discussions of all groups, the Workshop Scientific 
Steering Committee developed specific themes 
and sets of related questions that each Discussion 
Group might consider.  The themes are: 
 
 
• the use of models for designing and comparing 
process and monitoring studies; 
• identification of system boundaries and 
specification of boundary conditions; 
• coupling of model components with other sub-
models 
- e.g. requirements by Lower Trophic Level 
sub-models for Physics and Upper Trophic 
Level model outputs 
- different time and space scales 
• model verification and comparisons with 
observations.

6.1. REPORT OF THE ATMOSPHERIC-
OCEAN PROCESSES GROUP 
 
Contributors: Chang, Kono, LeBlond 
(Chairman), Nagata, Navrotsky, Su, Sugimoto, 
Taft, Werner 
 
Models of ocean properties and circulation have 
been developed, as documented in the report of 
PICES Working Group 7, to a realistic level of 
simulation.  These models yield patterns of 
circulation and water properties similar to those 
observed, although improvements are still 
necessary.  General circulation models (GCM’s) 
describe basin-wide properties, usually as part of 
models including broader areas of the ocean, or 
even models of the whole coupled ocean-
atmosphere general circulation system.  Regional 
models, applied to specific regions, are also 
available in many areas; they are generally of a 
much higher resolution, adapted to local 
bathymetric features and have usually received 
much more stringent observational verification. 
 
Development of PICES-CCCC ecosystem models 
for both lower and higher trophic levels could 
proceed immediately using existing GCM’s and 
regional models as a physical environmental basis.  
A number of these models have already been 
identified in the PICES Working Group 7 report. 
The resolution of existing GCM’s in space (1.8 of 
a degree), and time (1 day) is quite sufficient to 
accommodate the information requirements of 
ecosystem models for flow rates and ocean 
properties.  Similarly, the smaller scales of 
regional, coastal models are well adapted to the 
more demanding requirements of coastal 
ecosystem models.  Thus, although models are not 
claimed to be perfect, it should be possible for 
ecosystem modelers to use the output of existing 
physical models to start their own efforts.  There is 
no single model which will apply to the whole 
area of interest: GCM’s do not have the resolution 
necessary to resolve the details of coastal areas, so 
that regional models, preferably already tested 
against local data, must be used in local areas.  
GCM’s may however be useful in providing 
offshore boundary conditions for regional models. 
 
There is also a requirement for higher trophic level 
modeling, and particularly fish migration, for 
models of regions hundreds to thousands of 
kilometers in lateral extent - parts of GCM’s or 
extensive regional models - with sufficient high 
resolution to resolve meso-scale features and 
advective jets between them, as in the western 
boundary currents region and their eastward 
extension off Japan and the Kuriles.  Current GCM 
resolution is inadequate to the purpose. 
 
However, basin-scale GCM’s are recognised to be 
incapable of sufficient resolution within the upper, 
wind-mixed layer, where a resolution of the order 
of 5-10 m is required down to a depth of about 200 
m for representing processes relevant to the 
dynamics of lower trophic levels.  There already 
exist one-dimensional mixed-layer models which 
deal with the details of upper-layer heat and 
momentum exchange, nutrient fluxes and phyto-
zooplankton dynamics in that critical zone.  Such 
models should be grafted onto GCM’s for lower 
trophic level modeling.  In each grid area of a 
GCM, a sub-model of the details of the upper-
layer structure can be inserted.  Because the 
vertical structure of the upper layer does not 
change quickly in space, the same sub-model may 
serve for many adjacent grid areas. However, the 
wind and other relevant meteorological forcing 
inputs used to drive the GCM must be available at 
 
 
30
each time step with sufficient resolution to specify 
the evolution of the upper layer.  Providing these 
data and computer outputs is thus a major task for 
basin-scale lower trophic level modelers.  It is also 
worth noting that only the near-surface (approx. 
200 m, with exact thickness to be determined) 
results of oceanic GCM’s are relevant to lower-
level trophic models. 
 
Depending on the degree of vertical resolution in 
regional scale models, the same task may or may 
not be necessary there. Such models, 
encompassing shallow coastal areas, must also 
include tidal mixing effects and must be able to 
represent correctly the buoyancy fluxes associated 
with land runoff. There has also been some 
concern expressed about the accurate 
representation of high-intensity, episodic events, 
such as storms, whose influence may be highly 
non-linear and which may have a strong effect on 
some physical (e.g. erosion, mixing, ...) and 
especially biological characteristics over much 
longer time and space scales. 
 
There is considerable interest in the CCCC 
program in identifying the oceanic conditions 
corresponding to variations described by some as 
“regime shifts”, as well as their ecosystem 
consequences, especially their impact on the 
oceanic carrying capacity for commercially 
relevant species.  There is also some expectation 
that it may be possible to predict the occurrence 
and persistence of such situations.  A program of 
research which may help in this respect consists in 
the examination of historical observations and 
model results which may reveal large-scale 
patterns, in the period range from ENSO to 
decadal variations, which may be associated with 
“regime shifts”, perhaps relating ENSO and 
longer-period events with North Pacific 
phenomena. Physical oceanographers are not 
optimistic about the predictability of such events, 
especially beyond the ENSO time scale, in the 
near future, given the state of present 
understanding of large-scale air-sea interaction 
dynamics. 
 
Understanding is thought to be at least as 
important as predictability.  The examination of 
existing model and observational results should 
focus on the documentation of significant 
ecosystem-relevant properties in the various parts 
of the North Pacific, such as variability, vertical 
and horizontal mixing intensities, the importance 
of advective effects, contrasts between the warm 
and cold phases of El Nino, and “regime shifts” 
years contrasted to “normal’ periods.  Such a 
retrospective analysis of existing information, with 
special attention to those variables relevant to 
ecosystem models, is an important step in the 
study of the North Pacific ecosystem.  This 
diagnostic analysis may yield some understanding 
of the relations between the ecosystem and its 
environmental substrate (realising of course that 
some ecosystem variability may arise from 
nonlinear biological interactions which have 
nothing to do with the environment). 
 
Returning to the question of prediction, we note 
that testing predictive skills of numerical models 
may be achieved through hindcasting, i.e. 
predicting past conditions from prior 
circumstances.  Considerable improvements in 
predictive capabilities arise through continuous 
corrections of models by assimilation of current 
information.  This is the technique which keeps 
weather forecasts in line with actual conditions. 
Similarly, predictive capabilities of GCM’s may be 
improved by data assimilation, in the hindcasting 
as well as forecasting modes.  This is a cutting-
edge area of research that requires extensive (and 
expensive) data support and is currently the aim of 
major efforts by large modeling groups.  Oceanic 
data assimilation may not be available in the 
PICES area for some years to come.  In the 
meantime, ecosystem model development should 
take advantage of available GCM solutions in a 
simplified hindcast mode with forcings 
appropriate to specific “regimes” of past decades.  
If possible, new simulations should also include 
enhanced near-surface vertical resolution in 
anticipation of the ecosystem modeling 
community’s needs. 
 
Improvements in numerical models, their physics 
and numerics, as well as their foundation in 
observations (e.g. through the WOCE data set) 
will continue to take place within the wider 
 
 
31
scientific community. PICES CCCC program 
participants should be on the lookout for new 
developments in ocean/atmosphere modeling and 
take advantage of the progress that will inevitably 
be made. 
 
6.2. REPORT OF THE LOWER TROPHIC 
LEVEL RESPONSE GROUP 
 
Discussion Group Members: Dugdale, Frost, 
Kishi, Terazaki, Wang, Wheeler, Yoo (Chairman) 
 
Additional Participants: Chang, LeBlond, 
Nagata, Navrotsky, Su, Sugimoto, Taft 
 
Objectives  
 
The overall purpose of the lower trophic level 
modeling effort is to test the hypothesis that 
physical forcing factors are regulating primary 
production and that the effect is apparent in 
zooplankton standing stocks and then transferred 
to variations in higher trophic levels.  The 
objectives of the Lower Trophic Level Discussion 
Group then are to review the role and nature of 
lower trophic level modeling activity required for 
accomplishing CCCC goals, to decide on the 
relevant scientific issues and to suggest necessary 
steps towards the goals of CCCC program.   
 
Target ecosystem properties 
 
The Lower Trophic Level Discussion Group first 
reviewed the target ecosystem properties in the 
CCCC context.  The Group felt that the program 
output specified in the Implementation Plan 
needed more precise description and 
recommended changes should be made as follows.  
These changes should also be incorporated into the 
Implementation Plan: 
• physical factors controlling lower trophic level 
production 
• annual and seasonal primary production and 
new production 
• annual and seasonal secondary production 
• temporal and spatial pattern of plankton 
abundance and species composition   
• temporal and spatial pattern of nutrient fields 
• identification of major taxonomic groups 
• population parameters for key species or 
taxonomic groups 
 
The level of modeling required for CCCC 
implementation 
 
The Group felt that for the lower trophic level, the 
current scientific knowledge is adequate for 
building quantitative numerical models.  Modeling 
efforts should start with a 1D model with vertical 
resolution as initial efforts towards a full 3D 
model.  The Group recommends the initial 
development of a generic numerical foodweb 
model with at least two functional groups of 
phytoplankton and three functional groups of 
zooplankton, although the difficulties of this 
additional complexity on development of the 
models was recognized. 
 
The limitation of modeling 
 
The Group also recognized that simulation models 
cannot automatically accommodate qualitative 
changes in the ecosystem, i.e., change in the 
ecosystem structure.  One example is in East 
China Sea where the change in the circulation 
pattern results in the change of zooplankton 
assemblages with different key species.  Attention 
should be paid to this limitation.  
 
Boundaries of ecosystem and within-ecosystem 
heterogeneity 
 
Boundaries of ecosystems defined in the PICES 
CCCC plan reflect the hydrographic and 
oceanographic characteristics of the regions.  For 
modeling purposes, the boundaries should be 
apparent from the distribution of physical forcing 
properties.  For expansion from 1D to 2D and 3D 
models, individual models should specify how 
heterogeneity within each ecosystem is to be 
addressed. 
 
Structure of the model 
 
The Group agreed that the structure of the model 
should be as simple as possible but at the same 
time it should provide appropriate description of 
crucial tropho-dynamic linkages and top-down 
 
 
32
control effects.  This requires that biological state 
variables should be composed of functional groups 
based either on size (for phytoplankton) or on 
developmental stage (for zooplankton with cohort 
structure).  Thus the Group recommends the 
following list of state variables as the minimum 
structure. 
• nutrients 
• phytoplankton with two functional groups 
(sizes or diatoms and non-diatoms) 
• zooplankton with three functional groups 
divided into three classes of developmental 
stages (seven compartments in total):  
∗ microzooplankton 
∗ copepods (eggs and immature, juveniles, 
adults) 
∗ euphausids (eggs and immature, juveniles, 
adults) 
 
Processes and parameters that need most 
attention 
 
The Group recommends that process studies be 
focused on the following processes and related 
parameters, in particular: 
• nutrient uptake kinetics 
• zooplankton grazing 
• predation of fish on zooplankton 
• vertical migration of zooplankton 
• cannibalism 
• pelagic-benthic coupling in shallow seas 
 
In addition, where anthropogenic influences 
(nutrients and other pollutants input, and fishing) 
are significant, the effects of these factors on the 
biological production should be studied.  
 
Standardization of models for comparative 
ecosystem studies 
 
The Group next considered the needs of 
standardization of models on the grounds that 
using different process models (mathematical 
description of the processes) for different 
ecosystem models might hinder appropriate 
comparison of ecosystem responses.  Therefore, 
the Group recommends the use of standard process 
models. Selection of equations for processes will 
be based on scientific knowledge and data 
available.  Sensitivity analysis is also needed to 
decide which equations to use.  Standard process 
models should be used with the flexibility for 
development and modification as appropriate.  
Examples of process models needing 
standardization (or at the very least inter-
calibration) are: 
• P vs I 
• nutrient uptake 
• grazing and predation 
 
Information flows with physical forcing and 
higher trophic level 
 
The Group recognized that for proper lower 
trophic level modeling following physical 
properties should be given for input to the lower 
trophic level model: 
• temperature 
• salinity 
• mixed layer depth 
• vertical and horizontal nutrient fluxes 
(diffusion, upwelling and horizontal 
advection) 
• meterological information (cloud cover, wind, 
insolation, etc.) 
• finer vertical resolution in upper 50 m from 
GCM model 
 
The lower trophic model will produce food density 
as input to the higher trophic level.  From higher 
trophic levels, predator abundance and food 
selection characteristics are required to incorporate 
the top-down effects. 
 
Data requirement and validation  
 
The Group recommends that the following 
monitoring activities are required in both BASS 
and REX studies for validation and data 
assimilation: 
• time series for seasonal patterns (at an interval 
that can reveal temporal variation of 
production) 
∗ nutrients 
∗ vertical profiles of chlorophyll 
∗ zooplankton (three functional groups) 
∗ phytoplankton (two functional groups) 
• longer time series 
 
 
33
During the CCCC implementation, more than 10 
new ocean color sensors are expected to be 
launched, OCTS (ocean color and temperature 
sensor, Japan) being the first.  These sensors will 
provide information on the surface distribution of 
chlorophyll a, which can be used for validation 
and data assimilation of phytoplankton dynamics 
model. 
 
BASS and REX related issues 
 
The group discussed whether or not different 
modeling approachs are needed for REX and 
BASS.  The generic models are appropriate for 
both.  If the models are correct, the dominant 
components and fluxes of both coastal and oceanic 
lower trophic level processes will reflect the 
observed differences between BASS and REX 
regions. 
 
Minimalistic approach 
 
The Group recommends that even before the food-
web model can be constructed and ready for 
application, simpler approaches to estimate 
potential new production in the CCCC ecosystems 
should be attempted.  Possible approaches include 
examination of temperature-nutrient relationships, 
GCM estimated mixed layer depth, and annual-
seasonal changes in mixed layer nutrients.  More 
than one approach may be necessary to achieve 
estimates for all of the CCCC ecosystems.  The 
results can be further compared with fish yield 
data to provide a benchmark for its prediction of 
changes in carrying capacity as a result of modeled 
change in environmental conditions.  
 
Priority of action 
 
Work plans for modeling efforts were discussed 
but no specific plan was generated.  However, the 
Group recommends that the following should be 
included in the short term workplan: 
• One action item relevant to REX would be to 
assemble lists of data sets available in regions 
1-10. 
• Modellers of CCCC implementation should 
organize a workshop for standardization (or 
inter-calibration) of process models. 
• Retrospective modeling should be attempted 
using existing data such as Canada JGOFS 
data and Japan JGOFS data. 
 
6.3. REPORT OF THE UPPER TROPHIC 
LEVEL GROUP 
 
Participants: Beamish, Boltnev, Dahlberg, 
Hargreaves, Hinckley, Hollowed, Karpenko, Kim, 
Kobayashi, Lehody, Livingston (Chairman), 
Sakurai, Tang, Wada, Wakabayashi, Wooster, 
Yamamura 
 
Justification 
 
The PICES Implementation Plan has a central 
scientific question specifically regarding upper 
trophic level species:  How do life history patterns, 
distributions, vital rates and population dynamics 
of higher trophic level species respond directly 
and indirectly to climate variability?  Models that 
include details of processes that affect abundance 
trends, distribution, population parameters and 
food web structure of upper trophic level species 
would be an important component of a program to 
accomplish the goal of improving our 
understanding of climate effects on these species 
in PICES regions. 
 
Assessment of data availability for models 
 
Several model types were identified as potentially 
useful for advancing our understanding of climate 
change effects on upper trophic level species 
(Table 6.3.1). These models ranged from 
conceptual models of the food web to a dynamic 
ecosystem model.  The assessment of available 
data to parameterize such models in PICES 
regions indicates that for most regions there are 
enough data to parameterize many of these models 
for a subset of the key upper trophic level species 
in each area.  A listing of the key upper trophic 
level species, prey, and physical factors in each 
region (Table 6.3.2) indicated many common 
species and processes across areas.  These 
commonalities suggest that a modeling effort that 
would allow inter-regional comparisons would be 
very useful. 
 
 
 
34
Suggested models 
 
There are several models that can assist in 
answering the PICES Implementation Plan’s 
central scientific question with regard to upper 
trophic level species.  Different modeling 
approaches would be required to enhance 
understanding of climate change effects on 
abundance trends and distributions, population 
parameters, food web structure, and production of 
upper trophic level species.  Five modeling 
approaches were identified as currently feasible 
and desirable for inclusion in a proposed plan of 
work (Table 6.3.3).  The five approaches include: 
single species bioenergetics, mass balance 
modeling, early life history transport, top-down 
multispecies trophodynamics modeling, and a 
more detailed bottom-up multispecies 
trophodynamics model.  For each of these 
approaches a standard model and set of computer 
code would be identified.  Within each approach, 
the simplest model that is needed to address the 
issue should be identified.   
 
A simple bioenergetic model of adult upper trophic 
level species growth is currently feasible for many 
of the species in the PICES regions.  Such a model 
would enhance understanding of climate change 
effects on growth of upper trophic level species.  
Because some of the regions have species in 
common with other regions, this approach could 
improve understanding of differences in growth 
and production of a given species across its range.  
This type of model requires diet information of the 
species being modelled along with parameters 
defining the bioenergetic processes (e.g., 
respiration, activity, consumption). The simplest 
form of this model would not consider changes in 
prey abundance and would allow predators to feed 
at their maximum rates in order to predict growth 
changes at age.  The main physical parameter 
required is temperature. 
 
A mass-balance box model for each of the regions 
and basins could be done in order to identify gaps 
in knowledge and allow comparison of ecosystem 
characteristics across regions.  Although this type 
of model is not dynamic and does not have 
predictive capabilities, a model containing the 
main species groupings in each area could be 
parameterized for two different climate regimes.  
Changes in ecosystem characteristics between time 
periods could then be identified.  This type of 
model requires estimates of biomass, mortality, 
and consumption rates and diet links between 
groups of upper trophic level species and lower 
trophic level species.  Zooplankton biomass and 
phytoplankton production estimates are also 
needed.   
 
A simple model of early life history movement and 
survival would allow a more direct understanding 
of physical transport as the mechanism for 
observed changes in recruitment of key upper 
trophic level species in PICES regions.  This 
model would be primarily driven by physical 
processes of horizontal mixing, cross-shelf 
transport, vertical mixing, and temperature. 
 
Two sorts of multispecies upper trophic level 
trophodynamics models could be proposed.  One 
model would be similar to the Robinson-Ware 
model in which upper trophic level species are 
primarily entered as a top-down force for 
determining the degree of utilization of 
zooplankton.  This type of model does not include 
age-structure or any description of maturation or 
reproduction so it could be considered one of the 
simplest types of models that could be used to 
understand multispecies food web dynamics.  In 
order to better understand the effects of bottom-up 
forces on upper trophic level species, however, a 
more detailed model that includes age structured 
growth and mortalty is required.  Both of these 
models would require detailed dynamics of 
zooplankton on a daily or monthly time step.  
Temperature is the most important physical 
variable needed to determine changes in upper 
trophic level species growth rates. 
 
Modeling issues with regard to upper trophic 
level species 
 
There was a recognition that the physical 
boundaries of a species could differ depending on 
the process and life stage being modelled.  
However, for multispecies models the ecosystem 
boundaries would include the habitat boundaries 
 
 
35
of all main species (predators and prey) included 
in the model.  
 
Validation of upper trophic level species models 
has many problems including multiple outputs and 
how to examine and compare outputs to 
observations, multiple data inputs of varying 
quality, and a limited observation set to compare 
results against.  If large observation sets are 
available, one method of validation would be to 
tune the model against a subset of observations 
and check the model’s ability to reproduce 
observations not used in the parameter 
tuning/estimation stage.  Models can also be 
examined by their ability to reproduce 
observations when parameters are changed within 
their ranges of uncertainty (sensitivity analysis).  
Model assumptions regarding the functional form 
of the processes being modelled can also be 
examined. 
 
How to handle inter-regional migrants is an 
important modeling issue.  Emigration and 
immigration rates may not always be known and 
tagging studies to determine these rates are often 
difficult, time consuming and expensive to 
conduct.  A regional scale model could treat the 
species as a member of the ecosystem.  When it 
migrates out, treat it as a boundary condition to the 
regional model.  Alternative approaches would be 
to utilize linked regional models or to aggregate 
regional models.  The results of Working Group 11 
may help provide inputs of seasonal abundance 
and food consumption rates that could be 
aggregated by region for input into regional 
models. 
 
Direction and Priorities  
 
It is suggested that one of the five models 
identified above be selected for immediate 
examination and use in each of the regions.  
Perhaps a mass balance model such as ECOPATH 
may provide the best framework for initially 
embarking on such a modeling effort.  The 
ultimate goal would be to move towards an 
intermediate scale upper trophic level species 
model that includes mechanistic details for one or 
two key upper trophic levels species.  Such a 
model could be used as a submodel for a coupled 
ocean-ecosystem model that would advance our 
ultimate goal of predicting climate change effects 
on upper trophic level species.  A coupled model 
such as this would highlight the types of 
information still required, help guide process 
studies, and could be strengthened by an 
observation system needed for validation of 
results. 
 
 
6.4. MODEL INTEGRATION AND MANAGE-
MENT 
 
Participants: Blackford, Brown, Kashiwai, 
McKone, Megrey, Perry (Chairman), Suk, Welch 
(Werner, Dahlberg, LeBlond) 
 
General Concepts 
 
Conceptual, theoretical, and/or numerical simulation 
models are essential to integrate and focus large, 
multi-disciplinary and multi-national marine science 
programs. These models are tools, however, and not 
necessarily the end product of the science program.  
Modeling is a formal process which helps organize 
thinking about the problem, provides guidance to the 
planning of observational activities, and assists with 
the integration of the results. Modeling plays a 
central role in the development and analysis of the 
multi-national CCCC program. 
 
CCCC Objective and Sequence of Activities 
 
"The ultimate goal of the CCCC program is to 
forecast the consequences of climate variability on 
the ecosystems of the subarctic Pacific" 
(PICES/GLOBEC Implementation Plan, PICES 
Scientific Rept. No. 4, p. 22).  Discussion Group 4 
found it useful to restate this as a conceptual model 
and comment on a sequence of activities which 
involve modeling: 
 
Conceptual model:    
• biological productivity in the North Pacific has 
varied over time; 
• these variations are caused by changes in the 
ocean climate (which includes top down and/or 
bottom up forcings). 
 
 
36
Related CCCC activities (not strictly sequential): 
• focussed retrospective analyses (e.g. Science 
Board symposium at PICES V). In addition to 
being a useful activity in itself, it will provide 
data for development and evaluation of models 
in the North Pacific; 
• initial modeling activities, e.g. obtain output 
from physical models, and develop lower 
trophic level models coupled to these physical 
model outputs; 
• iteration of modeling with observation programs 
(BASS, REX); 
• review progress and results of these initial 
models in a workshop or symposium; 
• evaluation and incorporation of upper trophic 
level models into the coupled physics-lower 
trophic level model framework. 
 
CCCC Model Management Strategy 
 
Discussion Group 4 recommends a strategy of 
modular sub-models for particular ecosystem 
components (e.g. physics, lower trophic level 
models, upper trophic level models, and their 
constituents) which could be run independently or 
linked together through a common modeling 
framework.  The focus should not be on developing 
a single large ecosystem model.  This modular 
strategy allows for development and comparison of 
alternative representations of processes, e.g. feeding 
by fish on selected zooplankton species or sizes, 
versus feeding on aggregate zooplankton biomass, 
with both sub-models coupled to the same physical 
and lower trophic level forcings.  It also allows for 
researchers to construct their own models from the 
available sub-models, in order to emphasize certain 
processes (and spatial regions) if desired. 
 
Similar linkages would be developed in space, with 
outputs from a model for one region, e.g. the NE 
Pacific deep basin, providing the boundary 
conditions and advective inputs to models of the 
continental margins and regional seas. 
 
The Discussion Group recommends that 
development of sub-models use existing models if 
they are available and appropriate for the CCCC 
program requirements.  Sub-models for the various 
processes (physics, lower trophic levels, upper tropic 
levels) would then be developed as necessary. 
 
When dynamic linkages among sub-models are 
required, a common modeling framework is needed 
in order for this linked sub-model strategy to be 
successful.  The intent of this framework is to 
facilitate integration or coupling of sub-models.  It is 
fully expected and intended that different and 
innovative solutions be found for the problems of 
particular sub-models; the common framework, if 
followed from the outset, provides for a familiar 
"feel" to the models and for their easy integration 
with other sub-models (which internally may use 
quite different modeling approaches). 
 
Guidelines 
 
The CCCC model program needs to provide 
guidelines for the development and integration of 
sub-models.  These guidelines should include: 
• language - preferably avoiding platform-
specific versions;  
• standard output formats (including output 
naming conventions) - this is to facilitate 
integration with other sub-models; 
• recommended platforms - to try and reduce the 
number of platform-dependent problems with 
model use and integration; 
• technical issues - such as parameters input from 
files so that the sub-model need not be re-
compiled; 
• detailed documentation criteria, and presentation 
of results of sub-model evaluations (model 
results compared against observations). 
 
Evaluation 
 
Evaluation is a crucial issue in the acceptance and 
use of sub-models the N. Pacific marine science 
community.  The Discussion Group consensus was 
that model evaluation is the responsibility of the 
developers/contributors of each sub-model.  The fit 
of sub-model outputs to observations should be 
included in the sub-model documentation.  The real 
test of a sub-model, of course, is how well it 
compares with future observations, or observations 
not used to adjust model parameters.  In modeling 
the effects of climate variability, there is a difficulty 
 
 
37
with these changes affecting factors in the real world 
that are not included in the model (because these 
factors may have been unimportant under earlier 
conditions), e.g. the movements of mackerel into 
B.C. waters with warmer conditions, and their 
predation on salmon.  Close coupling and evaluation 
of observations with model outputs throughout the 
program is needed to recognize (new) important 
processes which may not be included in the models. 
 
Potential Goals for Initial Modeling Activities 
 
As examples of how this common modeling 
framework could work, the Discussion Group 
proposed the following as an initial potential 
modeling goal, and how to reach it. 
 
Goal 1: Model the temporal and spatial 
variability of phytoplankton and zooplankton 
biomass (and productivity) in the North Pacific 
Basin. 
 
Strategy: 
• use results from an existing circulation model 
for the North Pacific (a small number of 
potential candidates are available, see WG 7 
report); 
∗ this model may need to be run with different 
forcings to represent the circulation under 
different climatic conditions ("regimes"), 
e.g. the IPCC approach; 
∗ minimum required outputs are temperature, 
salinity, velocities (u,v,w), diffusivities; 
∗ scales are determined by the chosen model, 
e.g. 1/8 degree lat, daily time step; 
∗ model outputs are archived in formats 
available to the PICES community, and 
which can be extracted based on user-
defined ranges of time and space co-
ordinates; 
∗ meteorological data (e.g. cloud cover, solar 
irradiance) should be available on similar 
spatial scales - perhaps from inputs to the 
physical model, or as links provided to 
where these data could be obtained; 
∗ for linkage to lower trophic level models, 
there is a crucial need for inclusion of upper 
mixed layer dynamics and outputs from the 
physical model. If these are not available in 
the existing circulation models, an effort 
should be made to encourage their 
development. 
• use existing or develop new lower trophic level 
sub-models 
∗ these are linked to the circulation model and 
upper trophic level models by inputs and 
outputs as defined by the common modeling 
framework and guidelines; 
∗ if upper trophic level sub-models are not 
available to provide estimates of grazing 
and predation, these latter need to be 
parameterized in the lower trophic level 
sub-models. The output from such sub-
models could be archived for use by upper 
trophic level models which do not require 
dynamic linkages with lower trophic level 
sub-models. 
∗ such a lower trophic level sub-model would 
provide information on plankton production 
for use by individual researchers or 
community efforts in higher trophic level 
modeling; 
∗ if dynamic linkages with lower trophic level 
sub-models are required by the upper 
trophic level sub-models, then both sub-
models would need to be run in a coupled, 
feed-back process, e.g., predator-prey 
interactions; 
∗ physical data are also available directly for 
use by upper trophic level sub-models if 
needed, e.g. Lagrangian larval fish 
distribution models; 
∗ there is a clear need for higher trophic level 
researchers to specify the inputs and outputs 
they require to and from lower trophic level 
sub-models. 
 
Goal 2: Model the temporal and spatial 
variability of phytoplankton and zooplankton 
biomass (and productivity) in the continental 
margins and regional seas of the N. Pacific. 
 
Strategy: 
• similar strategy to Goal 1, regarding use of the 
common modeling framework.  Goal 2 differs 
from Goal 1 primarily in scale. 
• it is suggested not to archive the results of the 
circulation models at this time. Many are still in 
 
 
38
development, and there would be outputs from 
models for several different regions (e.g. PICES 
Implementation Plan); 
• in some cases, available physical and circulation 
data may be better than model outputs (e.g. Sea 
of Japan); 
• boundary conditions are defined by outputs from 
models in adjacent areas, if necessary. 
 
CCCC "Model Integration Center/Activity" 
 
Recognizing that development of a community 
framework and archiving of model outputs requires 
a dedicated effort, Discussion Group 4 suggested 
establishing a PICES-CCCC "Model Integration 
Center (or Activity)".  The duties of this Activity 
would be: 
• to facilitate the integration of sub-models, and 
retain documentation on sub-model structure, 
processes, evaluation (as contributed by sub-
model developers);  
• to archive (or provide directions to obtain 
standard outputs of) sub-models; 
• to provide technical support for coupling sub-
models; 
• comparisons of alternative sub-models and 
documentation of differences 
• provide visualization tools for viewing the 
model outputs (but not to develop these 
visualization tools). 
 
The difficulty with such a Center or Activity is 
funding.  It should be established in conjunction with 
recognized modeling activities and researchers, as 
existing leadership (in the field of modeling) is 
crucial.  It should be supported by a Steering 
Committee, and consist of at least one person who 
would do the technical work of archiving data (or 
keeping track of new model outputs and 
improvements and where they could be obtained) 
and supporting sub-model linkages. The example of 
the ERSEM modeling centre at Plymouth Marine 
Laboratory was discussed (e.g. J.C. Blackford and 
P.J. Radford, Netherlands Journal of Sea Research 
33 (3/4): 247-260).  This activity should not be 
established until progress has been made on 
guidelines for sub-model linkages, outputs from 
physical circulation models are available, and lower 
trophic level models are beginning to be available 
for coupling to the physical models. In any case, it 
should have a finite time period for its existence (e.g. 
3 years). 
  
Suggestions from Discussion Group 4 for 
funding/supporting this Center included: 
• soliciting proposals from member nations to host 
and fund this center; 
• voluntary efforts by existing centers; 
• by sabbatical or secondment of an individual to 
PICES (with the Institute of Ocean Sciences 
providing the associated modeling leadership); 
• funding by PICES through member 
contributions.

7. REPORT OF THE MODEL TASK TEAM MEETING - June 27 and 
October 13, 1996 
 
Chairmen: Sinjae Yoo, Korea Ocean Research & Development Institute, Seoul, Korea 
 Ian Perry, Dept. of Fisheries & Oceans, Canada, Nanaimo, BC, Canada 
 
The MODEL Task Team of the PICES CCCC 
program met near the end of the workshop 
(afternoon of June 27, 1996) to evaluate progress 
and discussion from the workshop and to propose 
a workplan for the next year to further the 
modeling activities of the PICES Climate Change 
and Carrying Capacity program.  This report 
includes the discussions and decisions of this 
meeting as modified by subsequent review of the 
final Discussion Group reports and further 
deliberations by the MODEL Task Team held on 
October 13, 1996, just prior to the Fifth Annual 
Meeting of PICES. 
 
Concept: The Task Team agreed that modeling 
for the CCCC program should take place as 
distributed activities at several locations in all the 
member nations, rather than be a centralised 
activity located at one or a few centers.   
 
Roles:  The roles of the MODEL Task Team 
within the PICES-CCCC program are: 
1. to encourage, facilitate, and co-ordinate 
modeling activities within the member nations 
with respect to the goals and objectives of the 
program.  It was recognised that a large 
number of modeling activities currently take 
place within member nations but outside of the 
present composition of PICES, and that 
contact and co-ordination should be made with 
these other groups or agencies to expand the 
expertise available to the program; 
2. to promote and facilitate linkages among the 
modeling activities taking place at the various 
component levels, for example, promote 
linkages among physical, lower trophic level, 
and upper trophic level models, and among the 
basin scale (BASS) and regional (REX) 
observation Task Teams; 
3. to identify and encourage modeling activities 
in areas or subjects which may be important 
but not yet well studied or integrated into 
existing models of the North Pacific, for 
example air-sea interactions, especially as they 
influence upper mixed layer dynamics; the 
microbial loop; or non-commercial fishes (e.g. 
myctophids) and marine mammals; 
4. to interact with the field programs to provide 
an integrating context for planning these 
programs, for analysing results, and for 
comparisons among regions. 
 
Strategy: The strategy that was developed to 
work towards and fulfil these is as follows: 
 
1. Availability of circulation model results.  (A) 
Following discussions and recommendations 
from this workshop, the MODEL Task Team 
will undertake to contact authors of general 
circulation models for the North Pacific, and 
to make available their model outputs to the 
general community.  These outputs would be 
available for any number of uses, including 
linkages to lower trophic level models, the 
physical background for models of the 
distribution and migration of upper trophic 
level species (e.g. fishes), etc.  The output 
from simulations with two different sets of 
initial conditions are preferred, to include 
conditions during the 1960’s and early 1970’s 
(i.e. before the marked change in conditions 
that occurred in the late 1970’s), and 
conditions during the 1980’s.  Data on the 
meteorological forcings for these simulations 
should also be available, since they can be 
important inputs to modeling other trophic 
levels.  Details on the availability of these 
model outputs will need to be worked out with 
the authors of the models, but might include 
storage of outputs by PICES Secretariat and 
access via the internet, or notification that 
these results are available and the website 
where they may be obtained. Action:  Perry, 
LeBlond.  (B) For coastal regions and 
regional seas, the use of regional models are 
recommended.  There are usually many 
 
 
47
different circulation models available for 
regional seas, each with different spatial and 
temporal resolutions, modeling techniques, 
etc.  It is therefore not likely to be useful to 
obtain outputs from any single model for 
community use; instead the MODEL Task 
Team (in conjunction with the Regional Task 
Team [REX]) will compile an inventory of 
circulation models in regional seas that should 
be available for integration with lower and 
upper trophic level models.  This inventory 
will include a meta-analysis or synthesis of the 
results, to identify what is being done where 
and what is not being done (gaps in activities).  
This is a natural regional follow-up activity to 
the work of PICES Working Group 7 on 
modeling of the subarctic North Pacific 
circulation.  Action: tba. 
 
2. Development of upper mixed layer models.  
The workshop identified a need for 
development of models of the upper mixed 
layer, and their integration into circulation 
models and lower trophic level models.  These 
upper layer dynamics models can be used to 
simulate physical properties of the upper layer, 
given circulation model outputs with auxiliary 
data on forcings such as wind, solar radiation, 
precipitation, and evaporation. PICES will 
compile an inventory and develop a synthesis 
(meta-analysis) of available upper layer 
models and required data sets, for use in 
communicating and stimulating inclusion of 
these models into general circulation and 
lower trophic level models.  Action: tba. 
 
3. Lower trophic level modeling.  There are two 
immediate needs for co-ordination of lower 
trophic level modeling activities that were 
identified during this workshop and that 
PICES can facilitate within the next year.  
These are (i) development of a database for 
vertical distributions of nutrients (nitrate) in 
the North Pacific, on spatial scales similar to 
the circulation models. These are needed for 
initial conditions for the lower trophic level 
models. (ii) Comparisons of models for 
specific physiological processes within the 
lower trophic level models, e.g. 
photosynthesis vs light, nutrient uptake, and 
grazing/predation models.  The issue here is 
that apparently relatively small differences in 
basic assumptions or parameter values in these 
process models can generate large differences 
in their outputs.  It is crucial to compare and 
understand the reasons for these differences, 
and whether they relate to “real” differences or 
to variations in modeling techniques.  The 
MODEL Task Team proposes to convene a 
small workshop in December 1997 or January 
1998 at Tiburon, California, to address these 
issues.  Action: Y oo, Dugdale. 
 
4. Upper trophic level modeling.  The Upper 
Trophic Level discussion group considered 
five models with varying degrees of 
complexity and analytical capabilities that 
might be appropriate for CCCC modeling 
activities.  They recommended that at least one 
be selected for early examination and use in 
each of the regions identified by the PICES-
CCCC Implementation plan.  The MODEL 
Task Team endorses this recommendation, and 
suggests that a simple and widely available 
mass-balance model such as ECOPATH could 
be attempted for each region.  This first 
exercise can be considered as a teaching tool 
that could identify gaps in knowledge, which 
would help focus the regional experiments and 
allow an initial basis for the intercomparisons 
among regions.  To facilitate this comparison 
and familiarity with ECOPATH, Dr. Daniel 
Pauly will be invited to the fifth annual 
meeting of PICES for a demonstration of this 
program.  To facilitate comparisons of any 
regional ECOPATH models that may have 
been stimulated by this presentation, and to 
introduce other more detailed models linking 
climate variation with fish dynamics, the 
following was proposed to the Fisheries 
Science Committee of PICES as the special 
topic session for the Sixth Annual Meeting in 
1997: 
 
Models for Linking Climate and Fish. 
Quantitative methods for evaluating the 
effect of climate variability on fish and 
other upper trophic level animals may take 
 
 
48
a wide variety of forms.  Retrospective 
analysis of time series data may require a 
statistical approach, while prediction of 
single-species and multi-species effects 
may be done using both statistical and 
simulation approaches.  Advancing under-
standing of climate effects on upper 
trophic level dynamics requires 
application of available tools to existing 
data and discussion of innovative methods 
or models that may provide new insights 
to system dynamics.  This session will 
invite papers that discuss or apply 
quantitative methods or models to the 
analysis of climate and upper trophic level 
dynamics, including bioenergetics 
(growth), mass-balance models, transport 
and migration, and multi-species or multi-
trophic level analyses.  The intent is to 
assess and advance the current status of 
models of climate variability and upper 
trophic levels and to identify techniques 
and models that can be applied with 
developing circulation and lower trophic 
level studies in the North Pacific. 
Action: Livingston 
 
5. Linkages among sub-models.  The workshop 
recognized the issue of facilitating linkages 
among sub-models, for example, agreement on 
common input and output variables and 
formats so that results of one model could be 
readily used as inputs to another.  At the 
simplest level, this requires specification or 
agreement as to standard data formats and 
their temporal and spatial resolution;  at a 
more complex level however, model 
integration may require dynamic linkages 
among sub-models such that separate model 
runs may need to be conducted for each 
simulation.  For example, the incorporation of 
non-linear interactions in predator-prey 
responses between lower and upper trophic 
level sub-models may require both models to 
be coupled and run simultaneously.  The 
MODEL Task Team will develop 
recommendations for methods to facilitate 
linkages among sub-models.   
Action: tba. 
6. Interaction with other Task Teams.  The 
MODEL Task Team must interact closely with 
the activities of the other Task Teams (e.g. 
BASS, REX) that may conduct studies in 
regional seas and the deep basins of the North 
Pacific.  This interaction requires discussion 
and collaboration on appropriate scales and 
locations for observations, and assistance with 
the integration of results into a framework 
allowing a more coherent understanding of 
ecosystem structure and functioning.  It is 
expected that the generic models and 
approaches will be appropriate for both BASS 
and REX studies.  The MODEL Task Team 
should act as a reference resource for 
modeling expertise in the North Pacific that 
can be consulted on topics of interest to the 
observational programs.  Data produced by 
these observational programs are also 
extremely valuable to the refinement and 
elaboration of existing models and 
development of new models for the regions.  
For example, information on the diets of key 
upper trophic level species is crucial to the 
development of simple bioenergetic models 
that could be constructed to explore 
differences in growth and production of a 
species throughout its range.  Discussion at the 
MODEL Task Team meeting of October 13, 
1996, suggested that MODEL may have a 
larger role in the Basin studies, since the 
Regional studies and their modeling needs are 
being conducted by the national GLOBEC 
programs.  One of the principal objectives of 
the CCCC Basin program is to compare 
ecosystem processes and dynamics between 
the eastern and western halves, and modeling 
provides an objective method to facilitate this 
comparison.  For example, simple mass-
balance models could be constructed for 
comparison of gross ecosystem characteristics 
in each basin, followed by more complex and 
dynamic coupled circulation-lower trophic 
level and possibly upper trophic level models.  
In the regional comparisons, the MODEL Task 
Team felt that its role was to facilitate the 
regional comparisons, for example by 
identifying overlaps and gaps in modeling 
activities, and suggestions to resolve these. 
 
 
49
Comments:  At the MODEL Task Team meeting 
on 13 October 1996 these was considerable 
discussion of the issue of co-ordination and 
standardization of models and model development.  
The MODEL workshop in Nemuro clearly 
preferred the distributed approach, in which 
various models are developed using different 
assumptions and tech-niques, in the various 
member nations of PICES.  This approach was 
endorsed by the meeting on October 13, 1996, 
which recognised that no one modeling approach 
or technique is sufficiently well-advanced or 
dominant over other techniques to warrant 
endorsement as a community model at this time.  
The Task Team further recommended a need to 
anticipate differences in model results and to 
facilitate investigations to understand these 
differences.  Such investigations should include 
intercomparisons of models for the same areas, if 
possible using similar forcings.  The proposed 
lower trophic level workshop in California is an 
initial step in this direction.  Once the inventories 
and synthesis of regional circulation models has 
been completed, comparisons of these models in 
similar areas would be a logical next step. 
 
Although not discussed in detail, suggestions were 
made at the October 13, 1996 Task Team meeting 
for a test case to develop methods and 
recommendations for linking the various sub-
models.  This could be done by starting with 
models which are already advanced and which 
apply similar technologies in different regions, for 
example the Robinson and Ware model off the 
west coast of Vancouver Island (Robinson, C.L.K. 
and D.M. Ware. 1994. Modeling pelagic fish and 
plankton trophodynamics off southwestern 
Vancouver Island, B.C.  Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 
51: 1737-1751) and the Wada et al. model for the 
Oyashio region (see Appendix 2 of this report on 
the Japan-GLOBEC Symposium).  Another 
suggestion was to choose a specific region, e.g. the 
Sea of Japan, and attempt to facilitate development 
of an integrated model system for that area.  These 
ideas will serve as suggestions for the next 
meeting of the MODEL Task Team. 
 
Summary of Recommendations/Activities (with 
proposed time scale): The MODEL Task Team 
will: 
 
At PICES V - 
• provide an opportunity to explore the use of 
ECOPATH as a simple mass-balance 
representation of regional ecosystems, and 
encourage application of this program to 
several regional seas. 
6 Months - 
• contact and attempt to make atmospheric data 
inputs and North Pacific circulation model 
outputs widely available to the PICES 
community, if possible with physical forcings 
typical of pre- and post-1977 conditions. 
1 Year - 
• compile an inventory and provide a synthesis 
of available models and required data sets to 
facilitate development and integration of upper 
mixed layer models into the North Pacific 
general circulation models; 
• develop an inventory and provide a synthesis 
of circulation models available for the regional 
seas (in association with REX); 
• convene a small workshop in December 1997 
or January 1998 to develop a database of 
nutrient (nitrate) vertical distributions in the 
North Pacific, and to compare specific lower 
trophic level physiological models; 
• convene a topic session at the next PICES 
meeting to compare and contrast results from 
regional applications of ECOPATH models (if 
available) and to promote other modeling 
techniques for linking climate and fisheries 
variability; 
Continuing - 
• develop recommendations for linking 
components of North Pacific ecosystem 
models, e.g., among physical models, lower 
trophic level, and upper trophic level models; 
• interact with developing observational 
programs as to the appropriate key parameters, 
locations, and measurement scales, and 
facilitate integration and comparisons of 
results.

8. WORKSHOP SUMMARY 
 
Ian Perry, Dept. of Fisheries & Oceans, Canada, Nanaimo, B.C., Canada 
 
The major objective of the Nemuro MODEL 
workshop was to develop the model-related 
requirements of the PICES Climate Change and 
Carrying Capacity (CCCC) program, and to 
produce a plan to further these activities.  The four 
Discussion Groups and the MODEL Task Team 
report present reasonable and considered 
approaches to this objective which will be 
developed and elaborated throughout the course of 
the CCCC program. 
 
Overall, the workshop underlined the central role 
of models in this PICES program. Models serve to 
extrapolate retrospective and new observational 
data through space and time, allowing inferences 
to be made of conditions which have not been 
directly observed.  Models assist with the design 
of observational programs, by identifying 
locations and parameters to which the model 
results (and presumably the “real” world) are 
highly sensitive.  Models also serve to test our 
understanding of the integration among 
components of the ecosystem, from atmosphere-
ocean interactions to the distribution, growth, and 
survival of fish, seabirds, and mammals.  The 
emphasis in these roles, however, is one of service 
rather than the end product of the CCCC program 
- the goal of this program is understanding the 
linkages and impacts of climate variability to the 
biological productivity and high trophic level 
carrying capacity of the North Pacific, for which 
models are one of the principal tools. 
 
The workshop identified clear differences in the 
level of advancement or integration of the various 
disciplinary models.  It identified how far along 
modeling is with atmosphere-ocean interactions 
and the ocean circulation, to the extent that the 
physical community was comfortable with 
obtaining and applying present circulation models 
to the CCCC objectives.  Advances in physical 
modeling are certainly still required, for example 
in data assimilation, in coupling more detailed 
upper mixed layer models into the general 
circulation models, and with representing small 
and meso-scale features in regional circulation 
models, but circulation models acceptable for the 
immediate (basin-scale) needs of the CCCC 
program appear to be available (the report of 
PICES Working Group 7 on modeling the 
subarctic North Pacific circulation [PICES 
Scientific Report No. 5, 1996] provides more 
detail).  Participants at the workshop believed that 
suitable lower trophic level models are not far 
behind the circulation models, and notable 
successes are being achieved with coupled 
circulation - plankton production models for the 
open North Pacific, particularly in the Japan and 
Canada JGOFS and GLOBEC programs (see also 
Chapter 3 by M. Kishi of this workshop report).  
The Discussion Group and MODEL Task Team 
have proposed activities to assist development of 
these models and their implementation within the 
CCCC program.  With upper trophic level models, 
however, no consensus was reached on leading 
models, or even modeling approaches, suitable for 
the goals of the CCCC program.  The Discussion 
Group identified five types of models, each 
appropriate for somewhat different problems in 
upper trophic level biology and management 
issues.  These problems range from growth to 
migration to multi-species interactions.  The 
consensus of the workshop and the MODEL Task 
Team was that this is an area that needs particular 
attention by the modeling components of the 
CCCC program, requiring presentations of 
existing models and evaluations as to strengths, 
weaknesses, and compatibility to the circulation 
and lower trophic level models, and the goals, of 
the program. 
 
The issue of standardization of modeling 
techniques and approaches was discussed at 
length, which led to discussion of the “community 
model” concept.  This concept sees a single, 
widely accepted ecosystem model as a goal of 
modeling activities within the CCCC program, 
which would be available to all participants.  The 
ERSEM experience (see Chapter 5 of this 
workshop report, by Jerry Blackford) was seen as 
 
 
51
an excellent example of this concept.  However, it 
was felt that such a community model is 
impractical at present for the PICES community 
without funding from a central source to support 
model integration.  It was also widely believed 
that such standardization of approaches and 
techniques is not desirable for the North Pacific at 
the present level of model development in all three 
fields from circulation to top predators.  The 
diversity of approaches, however, does make it 
difficult but also very important for the CCCC 
program to facilitate model integration and model 
comparisons. Modeling activities within PICES 
therefore need to be particularly aware of and 
concerned about the ability of common 
specification of inputs, outputs, and parameter 
initialization, so that different models can be 
assembled into larger models, whose results then 
need to be carefully compared.  The concept here 
is of models (or component sub-models) as tools 
in a “tool-kit” which can be assembled in several 
ways depending on the particular problem under 
investigation. 
 
One class of models that was generally absent at 
the workshop, yet was included as a component in 
the workshop title, were conceptual and theoretical 
models (in contrast to simulation models).  There 
is a need to identify specific problems and issues 
which require development by conceptual models, 
for example the definition and measurement of 
carrying capacity. 
 
In conclusion, I must express the thanks of all the 
participating scientists to the members of the Local 
Organising Committee for their help, hospitality, 
and hard work at making this workshop a success. 
The Service Room, computers, and meeting 
arrangements do not just happen - they require 
much work and planning, and it was appreciated. 
 
I also thank Mayor Ohya and the citizens of 
Nemuro for their support. Nemuro City has 
contributed substantially to the funding for this 
workshop, including support for seven foreign 
scientists who would not otherwise have been able 
to participate, and so we had representatives from 
all the PICES member nations. 
 
The members of the Workshop Steering 
Committee must also thank all of the participating 
scientists for attending the workshop and making 
it a success.

The China GLOBEC program, titled “Ecosystem 
dynamics and sustainable utilization of living 
marine resources in China seas”, has been 
identified as a high priority national science 
program.  It is supported by the National Natural 
Science Foundation of China, and is designated as 
a contribution to the SCOR/IGBP GLOBEC 
program and to the PICES CCCC program. 
 
The goal of China-GLOBEC is to identify how the 
changes in climate and anthropogenic influences 
will affect the dynamics of coastal ecosystems, 
with the aim of predicting fluctuations in the ocean 
and its living resources.  The program identifies 
five research themes: 
1. structure, carrying capacity, and health of the 
coastal ecosystem; 
2. food chain and trophodynamics; 
3. role of physical processes and physical-
biological interactions on control of marine 
production; 
4. recruitment variability and replacement 
mechanisms of dominant species; 
5. coupled physical-biological-chemical 
modeling. 
 
The first field process studies are planned for the 
Bohai Sea, with a timetable of planning in 1996, 
followed by field studies and monitoring in 1997-
2000.  This program is conducted by institutions 
from the State Oceanic Administration, Ministry of 
Agriculture, Academia Sinica, and university staff 
including physical oceanographers, chemical 
oceanographers, biological oceanographers, and 
fisheries scientists. 
 
The Bohai Sea Ecosystem Dynamics and 
Sustainable Utilization of Living Resources 
program has four principal foci: 
 
 
I. Bohai prawn life history and key dynamic 
processes studies - 
A. Bohai prawn life history and population 
dynamics; 
B. key physical processes influencing the 
prawn ecosystem; 
C. key biogeochemical processes influencing 
the prawn ecosystem; 
D. impact of climate change on the key bio-
physical processes of prawn life history; 
E. impact of human activities on the key bio-
physical processes of prawn life history. 
 
II. Zooplankton population dynamics and their 
controling role for the ecosystem productivity 
in the Bohai Sea - 
A. dynamic variations of the primary 
productivity structure and its control 
process studies; 
B. zooplankton feeding strength and 
transformation efficiency; 
C. key zooplankton population dynamics; 
D. response of the zooplankton community 
structure to environmental changes; 
E. exchange of matter at the water - sediment 
interface and dynamic changes of benthic 
productivity. 
 
III. Trophodynamics of the food web and the shift 
mechanisms of dominant species in the Bohai 
Sea - 
A. characteristics of food web structure and 
its changes; 
B. trophodynamics at high trophic levels and 
prey-predator relationships; 
C. shifts of dominant species and their 
responses to climate change; 
D. influence on shifts of dominant species 
caused by human activities. 
 
 
 
 
 
53
IV. Bohai Sea ecosystem dynamics modeling - 
A. model of primary production dynamics; 
B. ecosystem dynamics and forecast models; 
C. analyses of the influence of human 
activities and climate change on 
ecosystem health; 
D. assessment of carrying capacity and the 
sustainable yield of living marine 
resources;

Changes in the abundance and production of 
marine animals with respect to environmental 
changes have not been well studied in Korea.  
Some zooplankton biologists have examined the 
vertical flux of zooplankton and their fecal pellets, 
and others have studied the grazing pressure of 
zooplankton under different food concentrations. 
However, most zooplankton research has not 
followed the GLOBEC concepts. 
 
Some fishery scientists have considered the global 
warming issue and its influence on fishery 
resources in the North Pacific and Korean waters.  
Recently, scientists from the Korea Ocean 
Research and Development Institute (KORDI) and 
the National Meteorology Institute jointly 
organised an informal research group to find 
evidence of climate regime shifts in Korean 
waters.  Specifically, a pilot study revealed that a 
warming trend of sea water temperature in the East 
Sea/Japan Sea occurred off south and north Korea 
in the mid 1970’s, and that dramatic changes in 
some fish catches happened during the same time 
period. With this preliminary result, they are 
requesting research funds for a continuation of the 
study on climate change and its influences on the 
marine ecosystem. 
 
 
A1.3. PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL MODELS IN RUSSIA GLOBEC

The first stage of the GLOBEC-RUSSIA project 
(1996-1998) includes activities in three directions:  
1) Ocean-atmosphere interaction;  2) Modeling the 
fluxes of matter in the marine ecosystems;  3) 
Modeling the formation of lower trophic levels of 
the marine ecosystems, and ecosystem 
relationships with higher trophic levels. 
 
As the first step in a retrospective analysis of 
ideas, models and observational results are needed 
to find out the most appropriate ways for 
advancing the goals of CCCC. 
 
 
Ocean-atmosphere interaction 
 
In the problem of climate change and variability 
due to ocean-atmosphere interaction, the role of 
horizontal temperature gradients and anomalies in 
the ocean surface layer are regarded as important 
and appropriate for investigation. The basic ideas 
were proposed in 1964 (Navrotsky, 1964 a,b), and 
can be summarised as follows: 
 
1. Due to the vertical fluxes of heat and moisture, 
horizontal gradients of surface temperature 
effect the horizontal gradients of pressure in 
the atmosphere and hence the intensity of the 
cyclonic circulation. This influence must be 
especially considerable above the ocean 
 
 
54
because of the high heat accumulation and loss 
(by the mechanism of vertical convection), 
and neighbouring warm and cold waters in 
most boundary currents. 
2. Temperature anomalies in ocean currents lead 
to anomalies in cyclonic activity and changes 
in the trajectories of the cyclones. 
3. Feedback of the atmosphere on ocean surface 
temperature anomalies tends to change the 
direction and intensity of ocean currents and 
destroy the horizontal surface layer gradients 
(thus abolishing the cause of the atmosphere 
circulation anomalies). 
4. Because of circulation of water in ocean gyres 
there must be some periodicities in the 
alternation of warm and cold anomalies.  The 
range of periodicities is rather large as the 
exchange between deep and surface waters 
goes on at many space and time scales. 
5. The causes of ocean temperature anomalies 
can be internal and external.  In both cases 
there are no grounds to expect any kind of 
stationarity (stochastic or quasiperiodic).  The 
only pertinent external influence is likely to be 
from the sun, and investigations of relations 
between solar activity and ocean temperature 
anomalies are very promising. 
6. If we look for long-term changes in the ocean-
atmosphere system as caused by external 
factors, then the intertropical zone of the 
ocean is the most important, because waters 
there receive the largest amount of heat and 
are most influenced by changes of solar 
radiation. 
 
Almost the same ideas (not including the 
hypothesis about the role of solar activity) were 
developed by G.I. Marchuc, V.P. Dymnikov, Yu.V. 
Nicolaev, T.N. Palmer and S.A. Zhaobo (Palmer, 
Zhaobo,1985) and became the foundation for the 
long-term Soviet program "Sections" (for example 
see Atmosphere, ocean, kosmos - the program 
"Sections", vol.8, Investigation of role of energy 
active zones in the short-term climate fluctuations. 
Ed. G.I. Marchuk, Moscow. 1987).  Regular 
expeditions of the Far-Eastern Regional 
Hydrometeorological Institute (Vladivostok) were 
fulfilled as a part of that global program. 
The main results of these works have direct 
concern to the ocean climate changes from 
seasonal to interdecadal scales.  From the point of 
view of the CCCC Program the following issues 
should be emphasized: 
1. Maximum differences between positive and 
negative anomalies of heat transport into the 
Pacific midlatitudes through the upper layer 
(0-300 m) in the Kuroshio current system can 
be about one-half of the average transport.  
The same is true for the layer 0-1000 m. 
2. The changes of position of the Kuroshio 
frontal zone are correlated with temperature 
anomalies and can influence the pattern of the 
atmosphere pressure system and trajectories of 
cyclones over the North Pacific and adjacent 
lands. 
3. Temperature anomalies in the Kuroshio system 
are correlated with ENSO and have prevailing 
scales of 2-3, 5-7 and 9-11 years (Nelezin 
1993, a, b). 
 
The periodicities about 11 years clearly indicate 
the possible influence of solar activity on the 
ocean-atmosphere climatic system.  The most 
powerful verification of this hypothesis was made 
lately by W.B. White (unpublished report) using 
the analysis of about 2.5 million temperature 
profiles in all oceans.  The correlation of these 
global ocean temperature fluctuations with solar 
cycles is very high (98%), although the amplitudes 
of global anomalies of both solar radiation and 
ocean temperature are very low (less than 1%).  It 
becomes rather evident that climate change and 
variability should be characterized not so much by 
global averages as by the distribution of long-term 
anomalies over the globe. 
 
The plan of the Russian investigation in physical 
forcing of climate and ocean ecosystem variability 
is: 1) To study the interaction of temperature and 
dynamical characteristics in the North Pacific;  2) 
To study the physical mechanisms responsible for 
the correlation between solar activity and ocean 
temperature anomalies.

Modeling the fluxes of matter in marine 
ecosystems 
 
The main goal of studies in this direction is to 
model and understand the basic mechanisms of 
ocean bioproductivity.  It is known that the 
functioning of living matter is based on coupled 
polycyclic reactions, which form chains. 
Ecosystems are associations of living organisms 
and nonliving matter, so they must function (that 
is, carry out the fluxes of matter between living 
and nonliving parts) under the same laws of 
cyclicity, forming ecological and bio-geochemical 
cycles. 
 
At the first stage, the photosynthetic production 
(primary production) was modeled.  Due to the 
complexity of the biological components of the 
process it is practically useless to build models on 
the basis of mechanistic differential equations. But 
biological processes tend to stationarity (changing 
on scales much longer than basic cyclic reactions), 
so it is reasonable to try algebraic equations for 
their description.  The general method and the 
model of the photosynthetic process was 
developed by V.I. Zvalinskii and F.F. Litvin (1984, 
1986).  In the steady state the equations for the 
rate of a system of coupled cyclic reactions was 
obtained in the form of a continued (chained) 
fraction, reflecting the structure of the chain of 
reactions itself.  The scheme may be easily 
extended to take into account the reversibility of 
the reactions, branching of chains, multisubstrate 
reactions, the effect of inhibitors and so on. In all 
cases we can obtain solutions from a system of 
recursive relations.  For the case of primary 
production the internal parameters of the process 
are constants of relative resistances of reactions, 
which can be determined with good accuracy.  
Inhibition of some enzymes can be also accounted 
for rather strictly.  If we can determine the 
resistances of the degradation of biomass of 
heterotrophic and autotrophic organisms, the 
model of the simplest ecological system from two 
productive links is easily constructed. 
 
What problems will arise on the way to real multi-
component ecological systems?  First, we have to 
analyse polycyclic chains.  It is shown that if there 
is no branching, any polycyclic chains may be 
reduced to two cycles.  From the other side, 
mathematical and experimental results show that a 
complex, polysubstrate process practically always 
is regulated by one limiting factor (the transition 
from external to internal limitation is very sharp). 
Difficulties in the analysis of real ecosystems arise 
because of two circumstances:  1) There are many 
points of sequential and parallel branching, and we 
have to take into account many cycles which have 
very different time and space scales without the 
possibility to reduce them.  2) The constants of 
reaction between neighbouring links and at the 
ends of chains are not physical or chemical 
constants (as in the case of photochemical 
reactions), but should be determined from 
experiments depending on many physical and 
biochemical factors.  But once the algorithm is 
found and, if we have the scheme of a chain of the 
cyclic coupled processes, we can write down the 
solution.  So we can formulate the main problem 
for the near future as experimental and 
mathematical investigation of interrelations 
between different links of ecological chains to 
determine rate constants and relative resistances 
for use in the proposed scheme of model 
construction. 
 
Modeling ecosystem relationships 
 
The first stage of the Russian GLOBEC project 
implementation (1996-1998) provides for 
modeling to concentrate on the formation of lower 
trophic levels of marine ecosystems and ecosystem 
relationships at higher trophic levels.  The former 
models permit one to describe adequately the 
functioning of the lower trophic levels during the 
whole year (based on the relatively scarce field 
observations), and to reveal the knowledge gaps of 
the physical processes, which should be a priority 
in our expedition studies. 
 
We could introduce parameters of the already 
known climatic epochs into these models and see 
the reaction of the lower trophic levels to the 
climatic variability.  To illustrate the models of the 
first kind, we present the Okhotsk Sea ecological 
model (Fig. A1.3.1).  This model describes the 
correlated biogeochemical cycles of N, P, and Si 
 
 
56
along with the major transformations of C
org
 and 
O
2
 in the two-layered water ecosystem.  The 
model presents 8 areas of the Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 
A1.3.2) and can illustrate the dynamics of 
biochemical parameters, the dynamics of the 
biomass of heterotrophs, the dynamics of the 
primary production rates of diatoms, peridiniums, 
and blue-green algae (A1.3.3), as well as the 
herbivorous and carnivorous zooplankton (Leonov 
et al., 1996). This model, based on the 1991-1993 
data, allowed us to describe the characteristics of 
organic matter biotransformation and the primary 
production in the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem. 
 
Running the model has identified the knowledge 
gaps, which should be covered so that we can 
develop a more precise description and measure-
ments of primary production in any marine 
ecosystem.  Thus, the model gives a constant 
organic matter flux to the sub-surface layer from 
the deeper layers for the entire sea, though we 
know that this is not correct.  The precise 
knowledge of the spatial heterogeneity of this 
parameter could undoubtedly allow one, first, to 
change considerably the assessment of the value of 
primary production in this sea, and also to reveal 
the characteristics of the exchange of matter at the 
boundaries of the marked sea areas. 
 
The authors conclude that the advective transfer of 
organic substances is insignificant compared to the 
processes of vertical exchange, which occur in the 
specific areas.  However this conclusion could be 
due to an absense of reliable information about the 
water circulation in winter and spring, when the 
advection rates of these compounds can increase 
several times.  Despite these and other disputable 
conclusions of the authors, the work has indicated 
interesting possibilities in study of marine 
ecosystems. 
 
The next stage of the work on this model shall 
examine the variability of climatic, oceanic, and 
chemical parameters and shall take into account 
the available data of other climatic epochs, so that 
it could show the possible reactions of the lower 
trophic levels to climatic variability.  This stage 
could also allow us to investigate the influence of 
the variability of herbivorous and carnivorous 
zooplankton on the basin produc-tivity.  The 
model could also be applied as an instrument for 
more accurate determination of the ecosystem 
boundaries in the sea.  On the whole, this model 
permits one to take into account the organisms of 
the higher trophic layers. 
 
For more effective multispecies fishery 
management and more precise annual and long 
term TAC forecasting, knowledge of ecosystem 
interactions between the main fishery populations 
seems to be very important.  These problems 
cannot be solved even on the basis of reliable data 
without utilization of multispecies models.  Based 
on the experience of multispecies models of the 
Barents Sea ecosystem (Bulgakova et. al., 1995 
a,b,c,d) it is proposed to apply a modified version 
of MSVPA as a paramount task in the Russia 
GLOBEC (Far-Eastern Seas) Program. 
 
The methodology of multispecies virtual 
population analysis (MSVPA) adopted by us, 
implies the consideration of age structures of all 
the species included in the model of the 
community.  On the basis of catch-at-age data, 
abundances by age group are calculated 
retrospectively for  all species included in the 
model.  Coefficients of natural mortality for each 
population are split into 2 components - mortality 
from predation (M2) and natural mortality from 
other causes (M1).  The value of M2 depends both 
on population sizes of all predators and other prey 
species.  Hence the estimation of natural mortality 
and fishing mortality parameters turns out to be a 
rather complicated iterative process.  Thus the 
predator-prey interactions among populations are 
modelled. 
 
The time step for the model is equal to one quarter 
of a year.  The input data for the model include: 
catch-at-age by species by quarter and year;  
weight-at-age by quarter and  year (the new 
version); ration by quarter for all groups of 
predators of M1 by age and quarter (the new 
version gives the possibility of considering 
seasonal post-spawning mortality);  consumption 
rates (quarterly rations) by age groups of predator 
and by quarter, and - in the version to be 
elaborated - by year. 
 
 
57
Stomach content data are introduced into the 
model as mean weight (for a given quarter) of 
every age group of every prey species in the 
stomach of the predator of the given age.  These 
data are input for all years for which information 
on stomach content exists. 
 
All the necessary information will be obtained 
from a specialized data base which is to be created 
on the basis of ICES methodology (Anon 1991).  
Elaboration of a multispecies model on such a 
large scale and especially the development of a 
Data Base are impossible without strong 
international cooperation.  This is especially 
important for completion of the data base with 
retrospective data. 
 
Processing of feeding data is one of the most 
complicated tasks connected with the preparation 
of input data.  It gives rise to a number of 
additional problems.  For proper processing of 
data a number of special algorithms and programs 
for determination of prey ages in the stomachs of 
the predators are being developed.  These 
programs are planned to be revised and updated.  
For example, a proper method for estimation of 
reconstructed prey weights based on the degree of 
digestion has yet to be found. 
 
Even for a large number of stomachs sampled the 
information on their contents often turns out not to 
be representative, especially for older ages.  This 
gives rise to a number of problems of interpolation 
and extrapolation of functions of two variables. 
Averaging of data on food composition from the 
data base may result in a biased estimate of the 
mean diet for the entire population, because the 
area sampled does not include the whole area of 
cod distribution and because samples are not 
distributed evenly.  Since the predator is 
characterized by different diets in different areas, it 
is proposed to make use of "geostatistical" 
methods to take this variability into account.  The 
rations of predators will be estimated by the 
method proposed by Dos Santos and Jobling 
(Norway).  This method provides possibilities to 
take into account different digestion rates for 
various prey species and also dependencies of 
rations on environmental temperature as well as 
other parameters.  Values of M1 by quarter will be 
estimated by tuning the results of annual surveys. 
 
The tuning of the model (estimation of fishing 
mortality coefficients for the terminal year of the 
calculations) will be undertaken by means of 
independent survey information.  It is planned to 
investigate the possibility of "automatic" 
multispecies tuning methods within the model. 
 
The Prognostic model should incorporate the 
dependence of recruitment of every species on 
stock size and on environmental factors.  It is also 
necessary to estimate sustainable harvesting rates 
by means of computer experiments.  Experience of 
the application of this method in the Barents and 
Norwegian Seas was recently rewiewed and 
approved in Reykjavic by ministers of fisheries 
and experts from North Atlantic countries (second 
North Atlantic Conference of Fisheries Ministers, 
Reykjavik, 28-30 May 1996).  In discussions it 
was outlined that there is now a possibility for 
more effective fishery management.  It is now 
known that marine mammals of the Barents and 
Norwegian Seas compete for food with 
commercial fish and shrimp stocks.  They also 
consume an enormous biomass of herring, cod, 
capelin and shrimp.  For example, in 1992, whales 
(Minke Whales) in the Barents Sea consumed 
about 1.5 million tons of fish (including 335 
thousand tons of capelin, 450 thousand tons of 
herring, 75 thousand tons of cod).  The Greenland 
seals and Minke whales together consumme more 
than 2.5 million tons.  These data indicate the 
necessity to include multispecies modeling into 
managenemt strategies for fish and sea mammal 
stocks.

A1.4. JAPAN GLOBEC SUMMARY 
 
Makoto Terazaki, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan 
 
The Japan GLOBEC Committee was established 
in 1994, and presently consists of 21 members, of 
whom the Chairman is Dr. T. Sugimoto 
(University of Tokyo).  The Japan-GLOBEC 
program is supported by several universities 
associated with the Ministry of Education, 
Science, Culture and Sport;  by the Japan Fisheries 
Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries;  by the Japan Meteorological 
Agency and the Japan Oceanographic Data Center 
of the Ministry of Transportation; and by the 
Science and Technology Agency of Japan. 
 
The program has several research activities: 
I. Dynamics of the food chain through 
zooplankton and micronekton.  GLOBEC 
will predict how marine ecosystems respond to 
changes in the ocean physics resulting from 
global climate change based on the study of 
the structure and dynamics of the food chain, 
the most basic biological process sustaining 
marine ecosystems. 
A. Response of the Oyashio ecosystem.  
The ecosystem in the Oyashio region is 
mainly driven by the energy produced by 
the phytoplankton bloom. GLOBEC will 
clarify how the energy is distributed to 
zooplankton and micronekton through the 
food chain, and how such a process 
responds to climatic changes. 
B. Response of the Kuroshio ecosystem.  
The ecosystem in the Kuroshio is mainly 
controlled by changes in the axis and front 
of the Kuroshio represented by the large 
meander of the axis and the interaction 
between these changes and bottom 
topography such as sea ridges. GLOBEC 
will clarify how variation in these 
controlling factors affect the distribution 
and abundance of marine organisms and 
the structure and function of their food 
chain. 
C. Response of the transition zone 
ecosystem.  The warm water tongue 
formed by the Kuroshio intrusion into the 
Oyashio and the warm water mass cut off 
from the Kuroshio are the major physical 
processes controlling the ecosystem in the 
transition zone.  Accordingly, GLOBEC 
will examine the effect of these processes 
on the composition of organisms and their 
productivity. 
D. Response of the ecosystem in meso- and 
bathypelagic zones.  Every night from the 
mesopelagic zone (deeper than 200 m 
depth) where light levels are insufficient 
for phytoplankton growth, a large biomass 
of animals migrates up into the epipelagic 
ecosystem to forage, and then transports a 
substantial amount of energy and 
substances from the euphotic zone into the 
deeper zone (biological pump).  GLOBEC 
will elucidate the response of the 
ecosystem in the deeper zone to changes 
in the epipelagic ecosystem through the 
study of the food chain of these animals. 
II. Dynamics in the response of marine 
ecosystems to climate change.  Focusing on 
ecosystems expected to be largely affected by 
climatic change, such as the subarctic Oyashio 
region, the Kuroshio and the Kuroshio 
extension regions, and the Antarctic Ocean, 
GLOBEC will examine mechanisms causing 
variability in the stocks of the major fish 
resources in these ecosystems. 
A. Mechanisms of variability in the 
Oyashio ecosystem.  GLOBEC will 
predict how the Oyashio affects the 
ecology during the early developmental 
stages and which may lead to changes in 
the stock of walleye pollock, a key species 
in the northern region.  This will be a 
principle focus of the project HUBEC. 
B. Mechanisms behind abundance shifts in 
the dominant species of pelagic fish.  
GLOBEC will clarify the relationship 
between changes in stock size of pelagic 
fish such as sardine and the physical 
changes in the ocean, and examine the 
mechanisms resulting in the shift of the 
 
 
60
dominant species in the pelagic fish 
population. 
C. Studies on the response of the Antarctic 
ecosystem to changes in sea ice.  If 
global warming proceeds at the present 
rate, the warming will increase ice break-
up.  In this case, global warming will 
cause direct and indirect impacts on the 
ecosystem in the Antarctic Ocean.  This 
study proposes to clarify the relationship 
between polar ice cover and subsequent 
changes in the Antarctic ecosystem.  It is 
called SO-GLOBEC. 
III. Development and application of new 
technologies for measurement and modeling 
in marine ecosystems.  GLOBEC will 
establish new technologies enabling in situ 
multi-dimensional measurements of organisms 
in marine ecosystems and their environment. 
GLOBEC will also develop ecosystem models 
and individual behavioural models based on 
these measurements, in order to predict 
fluctuations in ecosystems. 
A. Development of acoustical and optical 
instruments for measuring the 
distribution and abundance of 
zooplankton and fish larvae by 
continuous sampling systems.  GLOBEC 
will develop instruments for in situ 
measurements of species, size, and density 
of plankton by adopting multi-beam 
acoustics and image analysis systems for 
continuous sampling of plankton. 
B. Observation and modeling of 
zooplankton behaviour under different 
levels of turbulence.  GLOBEC will 
clarify mechanisms of patch formation and 
swimming behaviour of zooplankton in 
relation to the micro-scale physical 
environment, observing both the intensity 
of turbulence and its affect on swimming 
behaviour of zooplankton. 
C. Development of a marine ecosystem 
model.  GLOBEC will construct 
numerical models showing the interaction 
between physical processes and 
production of zooplankton and pelagic 
fish corresponding with the in situ 
observations.  These models will enable us 
to understand and predict changes in 
marine ecosystems. 
D. Development of sampling gears and 
acoustic technologies for assessment of 
stock size.  GLOBEC will develop new 
net systems enabling the quantitative 
sampling of micronekton and fish juvenile 
stages which have relatively high 
swimming abilities.  Acoustic systems will 
also be developed to estimate fish biomass 
and body length in a natural state. 
 
 
A1.5. SYNOPSIS OF CANADA-GLOBEC PACIFIC OCEAN PROPOSAL   
 
R. Ian Perry, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Nanaimo, B.C., Canada 
 
Conceptual framework 
 
Pacific Ocean fish and plankton communities 
undergo large and ecologically significant 
fluctuations over years to decades. Stock collapses 
and extreme failures of steady-state fisheries 
forecast models have tended to accompany major 
shifts in the marine climate.  There is increasing 
evidence that these large changes in fishery yield 
are environmentally, rather than purely fishery 
harvest, driven.  Variations in zooplankton 
production, biomass, and composition (as 
mediated by physical transport and nutrient supply 
processes), and variations in predation (also 
mediated by ocean conditions), are key 
components regulating growth and survival of 
juvenile and adult salmon, herring, and larval and 
juvenile groundfishes.  Understanding the linkages 
to zooplankton and predators, and how these are 
related to variations in the physical oceanography, 
will allow transformation of existing management 
indices into more realistic and reliable ecosystem 
models. 
The Pacific component of the Canadian-GLOBEC 
program has two principal but linked objectives: 
 
 
61
• how do physical and biological processes 
affect the ecosystem structure off the west 
coast of Canada; and 
• what are the relative roles of the shelf region 
and the deep ocean in determining the 
production of salmon? 
 
The research will emphasize food web pathways 
leading to production of the most important west 
coast finfish species: salmon, herring and hake. 
Target processes and species include:  alongshore 
and cross-shore advection, seasonal cycle of 
upwelling, horizontal currents and water mass 
boundaries (physical environment), euphausiids 
and copepods (zooplankton), and both adult and 
juvenile finfish.  The conceptual model for the 
west coast GLOBEC program consists of three 
advectively- and biologically-linked ecosystems 
operating at increasing spatial scales (west coast of 
Vancouver Island, B.C. continental margin, open 
NE Pacific Ocean).  Each has important seasonally 
variable and physically-driven exchanges of 
nutrients and plankton with its surroundings.  Each 
also contains large populations of migratory fish.  
In particular, Pacific salmon integrate, over the 
course of their life cycle, the consequences of 
physical and biological processes occuring in both 
coastal and offshore regions. 
 
At the gyre scale, GLOBEC’s emphasis is on how 
maturing Pacific salmon utilize and respond to 
changing environmental conditions (both physical 
and food-supply) in the open North Pacific.  Major 
components of this interaction include horizontal 
and vertical circulation, zooplankton (primarily 
copepod) production, and salmon growth/survival 
as a function of their distribution and foraging 
strategies.  The major tools will be retrospective 
analysis and modeling, together with a limited 
amount of ongoing time series sampling. 
 
Along the British Columbia continental margin, 
the emphasis is on sensitivity of yearly ecosystem 
production to the place-and-time interaction 
between key annual physical and biological 
events:  shifts in current direction, intensity of 
upwelling, peak zooplankton population growth, 
outmigration of juvenile salmon and herring, and 
migratory arrival of major predators.  Major 
elements will be a spatially-detailed physics-
biology model, on-going time series observations, 
and focussed process studies of biology-current 
interactions along the shelf break boundary 
between shelf and oceanic ecosystems. 
 
Project Elements 
 
Central NE Pacific - Modeling 
• develop a coupled ocean general circulation 
and food-web model; and use to study 
seasonal to interdecadal variability of the 
central NE Pacific and the consequences to the 
marine ecosystem;  
• develop biophysical-bioenergetic migration 
models of sockeye salmon for the central NE 
Pacific to identify the importance of 
circulation and zooplankton production for the 
marine growth and distribution of sockeye on 
interannual and decadal time scales.  
Central NE Pacific - Observations: 
• provide an index of interannual variability in 
mesozooplankton production at Station P in 
the central NE Pacific, and evaluate under 
what conditions the zooplankton community at 
Station P is representative of the whole gyre;  
• evaluate covariance between past changes in 
zooplankton production at Station P and 
measured salmon growth rates, and develop a 
mechanistic understanding of salmon growth 
under varying temperature and food levels; 
• incorporate information about open ocean 
food-supply and physical environment into a 
retrospective multivariate analysis of survival 
rate similarities and differences among 
selected salmon stocks . 
 
Continental Margin - Modeling: 
• construct retrospective models of 
hydrographic conditions and circulation along 
the entire B.C. continental margin; 
 
Continental Shelf - Time-Series Observations 
• monitor hydrographic properties, circulation, 
and plankton characteristics, along the 
continental shelf west of Vancouver Island; 
• develop a index stock time series for selected 
salmon species; 
 
 
62
• determine year-to-year changes in the arrival 
time and total biomass of hake and quantify 
consumption by hake of euphausiids, herring 
and juvenile salmon; 
• track year-to-year changes in the distribution 
and growth rate of out-migrating juvenile 
salmon during their first year in the marine 
environment. 
 
Continental Shelf - Process Study 
• determine the temporal and spatial pattern of 
primary productivity, new, and regenerated 
production across the shelf and slope relative to 
current patterns;  
• identify the spatial and temporal distributions of 
larval and adult euphausiids in relation to the 
seasonal changes in physical and biological 
characteristics;  
• identify the seasonal evolution of cross-shelf 
exchange between shelf and oceanic copepod 
communities, and distribution overlap of 
copepods with larval and juvenile fish;   
• determine the flow patterns around submarine 
canyons off the west coast of Vancouver Island 
and their significance in inhibiting offshore and 
along-shore zooplankton advection; 
• Use compound-specific fractionation of stable 
isotope tracers to evaluate spatial and seasonal 
changes in food web linkages between 
phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish. 
•  
Continental Shelf - Modeling 
• develop a spatially-detailed coupled 
physics/plankton/fish model of the western 
continental margin of Vancouver Island.  The 
ultimate goal of the modeling is to recognize 
and forecast ecosystem production trends 
based on physical forcing of the lower trophic 
levels, and both natural and anthropogenic 
forcing of the higher trophic levels. 
 
 
A1.6. U.S. GLOBEC RESEARCH PLANS FOR THE PICES AREAS 
 
Anne Hollowed, NOAA, NMFS, Seattle, WA, U.S.A. 
 
The U.S. GLOBEC program developed research 
plans for four of the PICES regions: the California 
Current, the coastal Gulf of Alaska, the Bering Sea 
and the open Subarctic Pacific.  In April 1996, the 
Steering Committee narrowed the research for a 
U.S. program to a comparative study of the 
California Current system (CCS) and the coastal 
region of the Gulf of Alaska.  This report provides 
a brief description of the planned activities in these 
two regions.  A more complete summary may be 
found in U.S. GLOBEC Report No. 17.  U.S. 
GLOBEC reports can be obtained at the following 
address and on the U.S. GLOBEC home page:

Planning for a U.S. GLOBEC program for the 
CCS began in 1991 with a workshop on Climate 
Change and the California Current System (U.S. 
GLOBEC Rep. No. 7).  Many research scientists 
participated in this meeting.  The workshop report 
provided an overview of the types of research 
questions that could be explored in a research 
program focused on the CCS.  In the following 
years, plans for a CCS program were distilled into 
a Science Plan for the region (U.S. GLOBEC Rep. 
No. 11).  My comments are primarily drawn from 
the Science Plan for the CCS. 
 
There are four regional divisions embedded in the 
Science Plan for the CCS (Fig. A1.6.1).  The 
biological and physical characteristics of these 
four regions differ providing an opportunity for 
comparative studies along a longitudinal gradient.  
The Science Plan outlines four types of research 
activities: modeling studies, retrospective studies, 
 
 
63
large scale spatial studies, and mesoscale spatial 
studies. 
 
Four types of models were proposed for the CCS 
program: 
• coupled mesoscale biological - physical 
models that resolve fronts, mixed layer 
dynamics, and diurnal time scales; 
• regional-scale coupled biological-physical 
models capable of assimilating available 
observations (e.g. remote sensing data, buoy 
data); 
• regional biological-physical models linked 
with a basin-scale GCM; 
• modeling efforts that investigated the 
responses of biological metapopulations to 
spatially and temporally varying physical 
forcing. 
 
Retrospective studies proposed for the CCS 
program included five major activities: 
• document and quantify the properties of event-
scale, seasonal, interannual, and interdecadal 
variability in the CCS ecosystems through the 
analysis of existing historical physical and 
biological data sets and sample collection; 
• compare and contrast the nature of variability 
in processes and pattern from event through 
interdecadal time scales in all major Eastern 
Boundary Currents (EBC) from the 
comparative analysis of existing historical data 
available for the Humbolt, Benguela, and 
Canary systems; 
• document and quantify the interdecadal and 
centennial-scale variability in the pelagic 
ecosystems of the California, Humbolt, and 
Benguela Current Systems through 
reconstruction of proxy variables from 
paleosedimentary records; 
• using preserved samples that are archived (e.g. 
CalCOFI), examine the temporal and spatial 
genetic variability in target populations, 
especially as it relates to possible shifts in 
ecosystem state; 
• determine the linkages of the mesoscale, 
seasonal, and interannual scales to the longer-
term interdecadal scale through the integration 
of contemporaneous sediment trap studies 
with field process studies in the California 
Current with a full set of retrospective 
analyses for both proxy and paleological data 
and historical data sets. 
 
Five large-scale spatial studies are recommended 
in the CCS Science Plan: 
• assess and quantify the relative impact of 
physical processes in different latitudinal 
regions on the distribution, abundance, vital 
rates, and life history of key populations of 
marine animals; 
• understand the mechanisms behind these 
physical/biological linkages; 
• identify variables and sites for monitoring, to 
document future ecosystem changes; 
• use the understanding of mechanisms by 
which populations respond to present 
differences in forcing to formulate specific 
parameterizations for biophysical models, 
which will then project the responses of these 
populations to different climate change 
scenarios; 
• use the spatial and temporal variability 
determined by the large-scale study to develop 
a conceptual model for the EBC ecosystem 
response to various climate change scenarios. 
 
Seven mesoscale spatial studies were 
recommended: 
• examine the degree to which the amplitude, 
position, and timing of mesoscale features 
may be altered by climate change; 
• examine the role of various mesoscale features 
in determining cross-shelf and along-shore 
transport of meroplankton, holoplankton, and 
ichthyoplankton; 
• study the role of frontal dynamics in 
producing or maintaining gradients in vital 
rates, and the exchange between or genetic 
isolation of populations; 
• examine the role of mesoscale features in 
determining the links between plankton 
dynamics and the ultimate spatial and 
temporal variability in recruitment of fish and 
benthic organisms; 
• study the extent to which zooplankton within 
mesoscale features use behaviour to mediate 
their net transport; 
 
 
64
• examine links between life histories of target 
species and the timing of seasonal changes in 
atmospheric forcing and mesoscale circulation 
features. 
 
U.S. GLOBEC planning for the northern regions 
followed a pattern similar to the CCS, but was 
completed in one year rather than four. Efforts to 
explore potential research activities in this region 
began in 1995 with a workshop focused on 
Climate Change and the Carrying Capacity of the 
North Pacific Ecosystem (U.S. GLOBEC Rep. No. 
15). A second meeting was held in January 1996 to 
develop a science plan for the Gulf of Alaska, 
Subarctic Pacific and the Bering Sea (U.S. 
GLOBEC Report No. 16). 
 
The structure of the planning meeting in 1995 
included a day of discussions focused on six 
general research topics and a day of discussions 
focused on identifying key research questions for 
the coastal Gulf of Alaska, Subarctic Pacific, and 
Bering Sea.  The six general research topics were: 
• climate change: what are the likely scenarios 
for climate change in the North Pacific and 
how do they influence the ecosystem? 
• regime shifts and decadal shifts: can they be 
detected, what is their impact, are they 
predictable? 
• what is carrying capacity? 
• what is required to model the impact of 
climate change on the carrying capacity of the 
region? 
• what are the technological impediments to 
measuring the effects of climate change on the 
carrying capacity? 
• what are the spatial and temporal scales 
required to resolve the questions concerning 
climate change and the carrying capacity? 
 
The implementation meeting held in January 1996 
was convened to develop a focused science plan 
for the three northern study regions: Subarctic 
Pacific, the coastal Gulf of Alaska, and the Bering 
Sea.  During the meeting the Subarctic Pacific 
group and the coastal Gulf of Alaska group were 
joined because of the clear overlap in research 
activities between the two groups. 
 
The U.S. GLOBEC Steering Committee met in 
April 1996.  At this meeting, the Steering 
Committee decided that modeling efforts should 
be encouraged for all four study regions: Bering 
Sea, Subarctic Pacific, coastal Gulf of Alaska, and 
the CCS.  However, process oriented research 
programs would be limited to comparative studies 
of the CCS and the Gulf of Alaska. 
 
The following key species for the coastal Gulf of 
Alaska program were identified: 
• salmon:  pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and 
chum (Oncorhynchus keta) 
∗ show shifts that appear to be strongly 
associated with the apparent shifts in 
climate; 
∗ short residence times in freshwater; 
∗ salmon from different regions of the North 
Pacific have responded differently to 
“regime” shifts; 
∗ salmon are both economically and 
ecologically important in the North Pacific 
Ocean; 
∗ extensive historical data on salmon 
abundances, and opportunities to examine 
past vital rates (e.g. growth, size-at-age 
using archived scale samples) of 
salmonids. 
• salmon predators: adult salmon, pollock, 
herring, marine mammals (northern fur seal, 
harbour seals, perhaps sea lions), and bird 
predators (cormorants, pelicans, murres, 
alcids, and others). 
• salmon prey:  copepods Neocalanus, Calanus, 
perhaps others, and the euphausiids Euphausia 
and Thysanoessa. 
 
The Subarctic Pacific research plan will examine 
two hypotheses: 
• Hypothesis 1 (H
1
):  ocean survival of salmon 
is primarily determined by survival of juvenile 
salmon in coastal regions, and is affected by 
interannual and interdecadal changes in the 
Gulf of Alaska physical forcing; 
• Hypothesis 2 (H
2
):  variation in size-at-age of 
returning salmon is determined largely by 
interdecadal and interannual variation in 
physical conditions and productivity of the 
 
 
65
oceanic realm of the subarctic Pacific, and 
may show density dependence. 
 
Four types of models will be required to support 
this program: 
• a physical model of the North Pacific that has 
the ability to be coupled with larger scale 
atmospheric models to allow hindcasting; 
• a basin scale “gyre and coastal” coupled 
biophysical model that resolves the details of 
exchange of water and organisms between the 
coastal shelf and deeper oceanic waters; 
• regional nearshore biophysical models.  These 
should be capable of including coastal 
transport processes and detailed biology, 
including food web relations and organism 
behaviour; 
• detailed biological models, with perhaps less 
physical detail.  An example might be 
bioenergetic models of juvenile salmon, 
predator relations, seasonal prey switching 
behaviour, or nearshore food web dynamics 
for several environmental scenarios. 
 
Several monitoring studies were identified to 
support this program: 
I. continue or establish time-series to address the 
following questions: 
A. how does the Aleutian low drive physical 
forcing? 
B. how does physical forcing affect the 
availability and production of prey and the 
abundance of predators of juvenile salmon 
in the coastal Gulf of Alaska? 
C. how does physical forcing affect the 
production and availability of salmon prey 
as indicated by zooplankton in the open 
ocean (deep water of the Gulf of Alaska)? 
 
We recommend that several (for example, 
three) deep water moorings be placed in the 
Alaskan Gyre.  Ships of opportunity could be 
used to expand geographic coverage in the 
Alaskan gyre beyond those of the moorings. 
II. develop methods to measure cross-shelf 
exchange, perhaps using chemical or 
biological tracers; 
III. large-scale monitoring: recommend that U.S. 
GLOBEC monitors the circulation and 
characteristics of the Alaska Gyre and the 
bifurcation of the west wind drift as it nears 
North America by a combination of remote 
sensing, a few strategically placed moorings 
and/or transects, and atmospheric models. 
 
Process studies include: 
• process-oriented investigations of juvenile 
pink salmon conducted on the shelf region 
outside Prince William Sound in the northern 
part of the Gulf of Alaska.  It is proposed to 
conduct studies over the shelf (outside Prince 
William Sound), ranging from approximately 
143° - 150°W; 
• seeding of Prince William Sound with 
Neocalanus populations from offshore is of 
interest; 
• elucidate the mechanisms by which these 
interzonal copepods, which overwinter in the 
deep-water off the shelf, recruit onto the 
coastal shelf and into Prince William Sound; 
• recommend that studies sample the migrating 
juvenile salmon further to the west, perhaps 
even into and beyond Shelikof Strait. 
 
Three cruises are proposed to be conducted each 
year of the study:  during March, July-August, and 
September-October. The March cruise would be 
used to document the conditions of the coastal 
environment just prior to the spring bloom;  the 
July-August cruise would be just before the 
principal out-migration of pink salmon from 
Prince William Sound onto the shelf proper, and is 
primarily intended to determine the abundance, 
distribution, and species composition of the 
zooplankton populations; and the September-
October cruise would be during the period when 
the juvenile pink salmon are in the coastal 
environment (outside Prince William Sound) and 
would focus on measuring their growth and 
survival, as it is impacted by the trophodynamics. 
 
The U.S. GLOBEC program secured funding to 
initiate the Northeast Pacific program and released 
an announcement of opportunity in November, 
1996.  The closing date for proposal submission 
was Febuary 14, 1997.  Investigators will be 
notified of the status of their proposals in July 
1997.

Makoto Terazaki, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan 
 
The Japan-GLOBEC symposium was held on June 
27-28, 1996 at Nemuro during the PICES 
workshop on modeling.  The title of this 
symposium, "Development and application of new 
technologies for measurement and modeling in 
marine ecosystems" is one of the core projects of 
Japan-GLOBEC research activities.  This program 
consists of four subjects;  1) Development of 
acoustical and optical instruments for measuring 
the distribution and abundance of zooplankton and 
fish larvae by continuous sampling systems, 2) 
Observation and modeling of zooplankton 
behaviour under different levels of turbulence, 3)

11:40-11:55 Discussion 
 
11:55-12:00 Closing address:  Dr. Ichiro Aoki 
(Univ. of Tokyo)   
 
Dr. Saitoh described the annual variation of 
primary production in the Japan Sea (1978-1986) 
by using Satellite Ocean Color Remote Sensing.  
Utilization of ocean color data from the new series 
of ocean colour sensors, OCTS on ADEOS 
(launched in August 1996) and SeaWiFS on 
SeaSTAR (launched in January 1997) is expected 
for monitoring the marine envoironment, 
especially primary production in the Subarctic 
Pacific. 
 
Dr. Naito has developed many micro data tags to 
study migration behaviour of salmon, flatfish, 
seals, sea turtles, dolphins, sea birds and penguins. 
He mentioned the results of field experiments on 
swimming behaviour of homing chum salmon by 
micro data tag in his presentation.  The results 
suggest the salmon reacted to higher water 
temperatures and took refuge into deeper water to 
avoid it. 
 
Dr. Takahashi and his group have accumulated a 
solid 5-year long data set since August of 1990 at 
both Station SA (49°,174°W) in the central 
subarctic Pacific and at Station AB(53.5°N, 
177°W) in the Aleutian Basin of the Bering Sea, 
by using time-series sediment traps.  Their data 
clearly suggest that the biological pump in these 
regions is working efficiently.  Hence, these 
regions are generally acting as a CO
2
 sink, 
although there is cosiderable seasonal variability 
in the efficiency of the biological pump.   
 
 
72
According to Dr. Iida, the use of acoustic surveys 
is a promising technique that allows quick and 
precise estimates of fish stock size.  In recent 
years, several acoustic surveys using scientific 
echosounders have provided useful data.  He 
reported the results of acoustic investigations to 
distinguish walleye pollock from other species, 
and adults from juveniles.  He also mentioned the 
improvements in downward-looking 
echosounders. 
 
Dr. Miura developed new sampling gears a 
midwater trawl net with mouth-opening canvas 
devices and a towed midwater gill net with a 
single warp that controls net depth for stock 
assessment. He introduced the results of test 
operation of both gears.  Those new gears were 
very effective for sampling pelagic fish such as 
sardine. 
 
Dr. Terazaki mentioned the design of his 
developed vertical plankton sampler (VMPS) and 
the results of its operation.  The required towing 
time from 2,000 m depth is about 90 minutes, 
therefore, it is possible to collect more than ten 
time-series samples from the deep sea each day.  
Diel vertical migration of copepods and 
chaetognaths were recognized by continuous 
sampling with the VMPS in various waters of the 
Pacific.  This sampler is effective at collecting 
soft-bodied plankton without damage. 
 
Dr. Matsushita introduced his hand-made 
apparatus for continuous sampling of fish eggs and 
plankton.  This continuous plankton sampler 
(CPS) collects micro-plankton by using the sea 
water pumped up during ship running.  The CPS 
was operated for a survey of anchovy egg 
distribution and plankton blooms in the coastal 
waters. 
 
Drs. Yamazaki and Squires have compared the 
observed rms turbulent velocity and swimming 
ability of several planktonic organisms, and found 
that the swimming ability of zooplankton in the 
seasonal thermocline generally exceeds the rms 
turbulent velocity.  They developed a new 
Lagrangian model to examine how an organism 
may take advantage of existing flow structures in 
order to reduce biological energy in the upward 
swimming effort.  A preliminary result by using 
the new model was presented. 
 
Dr. Isoda used a barotropic model to investigate 
the physical transport of walleye pollock eggs 
around Funka Bay, northern Japan.  Specific 
features of egg distributions observed in late 
February were reproduced by this model, such as 
the accumulation of eggs in the central part of 
Funka Bay.  The modeled flow pattern shows that 
a predominant northwesterly wind in winter is 
responsible for the formation of the vortex pair 
within the bay. 
 
Dr. Iizumi used stable isotope ratios of particulate 
carbon and nitrogen to investigate trophic level 
relationship among invertebrates living in the 
small estuary, Akkeshi-Ko, northern Japan.  
Detritus in the estuarine water is derived mainly 
from epiphytic microalgae, phytoplankton and 
seagrass, all of which are of estuarine origin, that 
is, producted within the estuary, despite a large 
input of organic matter from the river.  Nitrogen 
isotope ratios of Crangon (Decapoda) increased 
with the increase of its body weight, suggesting 
changes in food habit with its growth.  The same 
trend was observed when nitrogen isotope ratios of 
all invertebrates were plotted against their body 
size irrespective of their species.  
 
Dr. Sakuramoto introduced the fuzzy control 
model to estimate relative recruitment from catch-
at-age data.  In the fuzzy control approach, the size 
of recruitment is inferred using information about 
the level of catch, not by using the fisheries 
equations for cohort analysis.  Simulation tests 
were conducted to determine the performance of 
this approach including comparison with a 
conventional method.  The fuzzy method 
possessed a higher robustness to the noise in the 
catch-at-age data than the conventional method. 
 
Dr. Navrotsky discussed the distribution of sea 
weeds in the Japan Sea to explain the data 
processing and modeling of ecological processes.  
 
Dr. Lehodey analyzed the distribution of skipjack 
tuna catches in the western Pacific Ocean in 
 
 
73
relation to their oceanic environment.  A general 
linear model (GLM) is used to seek the best 
relationship between skipjack catches and the 
environmental parameters.  The modeled 
distribution of the skipjack food is the second 
parameter selected in the GLM after the sea 
surface temperature.  This provides a plausible 
explanation for the distribution of skipjack tuna in 
the two major surface fishing zones in the Pacific 
exploited by purse seiners.  The influence of the 
oceanic circulation on the distribution of the food 
of skipjack appears as a possible response to the 
paradoxical presence of a high tuna biomass in 
low productive waters. 
 
Dr. Wada and his group developed a 
trophodynamics model combining the models 
describing plankton dynamics and prey-predator 
systems among the dominant plankton and fishes 
in the Oyashio shelf region to forecast the 
response of fish production to possible changes in 
the physical environment.  The model consists of 
four physical forcing functions, six biological 
pools, and twenty processes among these functions 
and pools.  Changes in the level of primary 
production, timing of the peak, and level of 
zooplankton production were more strongly 
influenced by variations in physical conditions 
than they were by changes in sardine biomass.  
Warm conditons increased primary and zoopalnton 
production, especially euphausiid production, and 
pollock production.  The model structure 
suggested that pollock compete with sardine for 
food, therefore reduced migrations of sardines into 
pollock areas was favourable for pollock growth. 
 
Dr. Werner and his group considered 
trophodynamic effects on the growth and survival 
of larval cod and haddock on Georges Bank during 
late winter/early spring by using an individual 
based model approach.  The results suggest that 
larval feeding behaviour, and especially the ability 
of larvae to purse encountered prey, could be an 
important input to larval growth and survival 
models.  The inclusion of turbulence in determing 
the position of passive larvae in the water column 
allows the larvae to sample the entire water 
column, contributing to a decrease in the variance 
of the size of the larvae over time.

BASS WORKPLAN 
 
Introduction 
 
The Basin Studies Task Team will facilitate the 
exchange of scientific data and encourage 
scientific research relating to the implementation 
of the PICES Science Plan.  In general, the 
oceanography and ecology of the eastern and 
western basins of the subarctic Pacific are poorly 
understood relative to the coastal areas.  It is 
known that the central subarctic Pacific is 
productive as indicated by the large abundance of 
Pacific salmon, squid and other important fishes.  
Recent studies also suggest that the oceanography 
of the gyres is closely linked to the decadal scale 
changes in climate.  It is important, therefore, that 
there is a coordinated effort to focus on the 
priority research issues and to exchange scientific 
information on a timely basis. 
 
In developing the BASS work plan, we noted that 
the science plan of the North Pacific Anadromous 
Fish Commission is closely associated with the 
climate change and carrying capacity program of 
PICES.  The NPAFC Science Panel is formatted to 
identify research on the life history of Pacific 
salmon, salmon population dynamics, and on the 
habitat and ecosystem of salmon.  It is the research 
relating to the habitat and the ecosystem of salmon 
that is most closely related to the immediate plans 
of the PICES, CCCC Program.  NPAFC identified 
three areas of interest, physical-biological 
interaction and productivity, climate change 
effects and regime effects.  While the NPAFC 
Science Plan is focused on salmon and the PICES, 
CCCC Program addresses the broader, ecosystem 
interactions, it is clear that both plans are inter-
related and mutually supportive.  
 
BASS, therefore must ensure that the results of all 
research activities are distributed as quickly as 
possible.  To do this will require developing a 
system of identifying research activities. 
 
BASS had its first meeting during the Fourth 
Annual PICES Meeting in Qingdao, China, when 
an agreement on organization and general 
objectives was achieved.  The task of BASS is to 
facilitate studies of the impacts of climate change 
and climate variability on the physical and 
biological processes in the gyres of the western 
and eastern subarctic Pacific Ocean.  In general, it 
can be considered that these processes drive the 
shelf processes that impact on coastal marine 
resources. 
 
The objective of the CCCC Program is to identify 
the impacts of climate change on the ecosystems 
of the subarctic Pacific.  A key component to 
understanding this linkage is the relationship 
between plankton production and the production at 
higher trophic levels.  The CCCC Program 
incooperation with other national and international 
programs, provides a unique opportunity to 
understand the mechanisms that affect the carrying 
capacity for species within the two gyres and in 
the coastal areas of the member countries.  The 
key scientific questions are as follows: 
• Physical forcing:  What are the characteristics 
of climate variability and can interdecadal 
patterns be identified, how and when do 
they arise? 
 
• Lower trophic level response:  How do 
primary and secondary producers respond 
in productivity, and in species and size 
composition, to climate variability in 
different ecosystems of the subarctic 
Pacific? 
 
• Higher trophic level response:  How do life 
history patterns, distributions, vital rates, 
and population dynamics of higher trophic 
level species respond directly and 
indirectly to climate variability? 
 
• Ecosystem interaction:  How are subarctic 
Pacific ecosystems structured?  Do higher 
trophic levels respond to climate 
variability solely as a consequence of 
bottom up forcing?  Are there significant 
intra-trophic level and top down effects on 
lower trophic level production and on 
energy transfer efficiencies?  The key 
research activities were identified as (1) 
retrospective analyses;  (2) development 
 
 
79
of models; (3) process studies;  (4) 
development of observations systems;  
and (5) data management. 
 
At this second meeting of BASS, we invited other 
participants of the MODEL Workshop to help 
develop an action plan that was achievable and 
would facilitate the implementation of the CCCC 
Program. 
 
The approach of BASS was to identify the 
following tasks and seek the support of the 
Implementation Committee and Science Board to 
ask the member countries to facilitate the 
involvement of their scientists.  BASS noted that it 
may be necessary for the Science Board to 
consider that a specific plan of action may need to 
be approved for the subarctic gyres because 
countries tend to focus their research within their 
coastal areas. 
 
BASS developed a work plan consisting of some 
general, longer-term goals and some specific 
action items.  The long-term plan is intended to be 
a general indication of the activities over the next 
5 years and the short-term plan is the work 
expected to be completed each year.  The plans are 
overly ambitious and lack specific commitment 
from the participating countries, however they 
provide background information for any group or 
country planning research in the subarctic Pacific.  
The annual plans will require a considerable effort, 
and will succeed if all BASS members in 
particular, and PICES participants in general, can 
assist in the management of the plans.  
 
 
 
 
Long-term (5 year) Plan 
 
1. Retrospective comparison of lower trophic 
level dynamics in the eastern and western 
subarctic gyres:  a link between climate change 
and higher trophic levels. 
 
Lower tropic level dynamics have been well 
studied and modeled for Station P in the eastern 
gyre (SUPER references 1993).  Sufficient data 
may now exist for comparison with the western 
subarctic gyre (Taguchi 1995, PICES Report No. 
3).  Comparisons of seasonal data for nutrient 
dynamics, Chlorphyll and zooplankton standing 
stocks, and sedimentation of C and N should 
provide insights into factors controlling total and 
exportable production and how these factors are 
affected by climate change.  Important questions 
include: 
 
i. Is there sufficient data available from 
representative sites in each gyre for this 
comparison? 
ii. Are there significant differences between the 
gyres in seasonable changes of these 
parameters? 
iii. If so, what are the implications for factors 
controlling total and exportable production at 
each site? 
iv. What are best sites for long-term observations 
and process studies? 
 
Maximum exportable (sedimentation or transfer to 
higher trophic level) production is set by the 
seasonal utilization of nitrate by phytoplankton.  
Differences between seasonal nitrate use and 
accumulation of nitrogen in biomass (LTL) and 
sinking flux indicates the amount of nitrogen that 
can be passed on to higher trophic levels.  
Preliminary comparison of the data sets are shown 
in Table 1.

Differences between the sites (and possibly long-
term climate affects) may be due to physical 
forcing features which affect mixed layer depth or 
atmospheric inputs of iron. 
 
We propose to complete a review of nitrate 
concentrations which would include a comparison 
of the physical regime at both gyres.

 Koike - N and C Budget 
 
2. Zooplankton standardization 
 
A major barrier for both retrospective analyses and 
on-going process/monitoring studies is the lack of 
standardization of sampling equipment and 
methodology for zooplankton sampling.  We 
propose to resolve these differences by: 
 
i. identification of important datasets of 
zooplankton abundance for the eastern and 
western gyre (with assistance of TCODE). 
ii. documentation of sampling methodologies 
used in these datasets. 
iii. development of conversion algorithms and 
guidelines for their application.  This may 
involve new sample collections using different 
gear and methods. 
iv. develop recommendations for common 
sampling equipment and methodologies for 
mesozooplankton for use in the PICES region. 
 
3. Time series measurements of primary 
productivity and zooplankton stocks 
 
Time-series measurements of primary productivity 
and zooplankton stocks in the open ocean sector of 
the subarctic Pacific are required to better 
understand the relationship between changes in 
plankton populations and changes in the physical-
chemical environment.  A long time-series (1952-
1981) of weathership data in the eastern subarctic 
Pacific was obtained at Ocean Station P (50 N 145 
W).  These data show chlorophyll levels varying 
between relatively narrow limits of 0.15 - 0.75 
mg/m (Wong et al., 1995) which indicates 
phytoplankton stocks are nearly constant through 
the year even though there is a strong annual cycle 
in primary productivity.  Miller (1993) has 
suggested that the lack of a strong seasonal cycle 
in phytoplankton stock can be explained by the 
variation in the intensity of grazing by 
zooplankton.  However the Station P data are 
suitable for demonstrating whether variations in 
zooplankton stocks are related in some direct 
fashion to primary productivity.  There are no 
comparable time series data from the western 
subarctic Pacific that can be used to study the 
variability of phytoplankton/zooplankton stocks.  
Higher production rates and greater zooplankton 
standing stocks are thought to occur in the western 
subarctic Pacific.  It is anticipated that the 
relationships in the western Pacific will be 
different because the physical conditions there 
differ markedly (deep mixed layer). 
 
The BASS Task Team recommends that PICES 
promote the installation of robust instrumented 
surface moorings in the subarctic Pacific which are 
capable of providing well-calibrated data on 
phytoplankton standing stock, primary 
 
 
 
81
productivity, dissolved inorganic nutrient 
concentration and zooplankton biomass.  
Additional physical variables will be measured 
which will be useful in interpreting the 
relationships.  Appropriate sensors are available, 
or are under active development, to measure these 
variables.  A minimum measurement program 
would be to place one mooring at the centers of 
the Alaska and Western Pacific Subarctic gyres.  
Comparison of the two data sets should document 
the dynamics of the variability of the 
phytoplankton and zooplankton stocks in the two 
regions.  There also is a strong argument for a 
mooring at the site of Station P because of the 
valuable historical climatic record which exists 
there.  The moorings should be maintained long 
enough to document interannual variability and 
hopefully a "regime shift". 
 
4. Inventory of higher trophic level species 
 
It is difficult to consider the impact of physical 
changes in the two gyres because it is not possible 
to identify easily the higher trophic level residents.  
As part of the initial effort of standardizing data 
and building data bases, BASS will identify the 
key higher trophic level species, produce brief life 
histories and provide data from fisheries.  Data 
will be assembled from as far back as possible, but 
the focus will be to identify the current species 
composition. 
 
5. BASS will need to acquire the work or science 
plans of all agencies carrying out research in the 
eastern and western gyres.  As part of the annual 
report of BASS, the proposed and completed 
research should be identified.  
Short-term plan 
 
BASS is recommending that a series of theme 
papers on the dynamics of the ecosystems in the 
eastern and western gyres of the subarctic Pacific 
be produced.  Each theme paper would be 
produced by at least one North American and one 
Asian author, possibly with an author from each 
country.  One author would coordinate the writing 
of the paper and summarize the results at a one-
day symposium to be held at the PICES Annual 
Meeting in 1997.

REX TASK TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
Introduction 
 
An implementation plan (PHASE 1) for the 
Climate Change and Carrying Capacity (CCCC) 
program was presented at the fourth annual PICES 
meeting in Qingdao, China (PICES Scientific 
Report No. 4). During the annual meeting, the 
Executive Committee (EC) of the Implementation 
Panel (IP) recommended and approved the 
formation of the REX (Regional Experiment) Task 
Team.  The REX Task Team is responsible for 
developing a plan for inter-comparison of regional 
studies, as proposed in the implementation plan.  
This document contains the REX research plan. 
 
Regional Components: 
 
The CCCC Science Plan (PICES Scientific Report 
No. 4) identifies 10 regional components of the 
Climate Change and Carrying Capacity program:  
 
1. California Current System, south 
2. California Current System, Oregon to 
Vancouver Island 
3. Southeast, Central Alaska 
4. Eastern Bering Sea 
5. Western Bering Sea/Kamchatka 
6. Okhotsk Sea 
7. Oyashio-Kuroshio 
8. Japan Sea/East Sea 
9. Bohai, Yellow Sea 
10. East China Sea 
 
The CCCC Science Plan calls for comparative 
studies of ecosystems along the continental margins 
of the subarctic Pacific.  These regional scale 
ecosystem studies should compare how variations in 
ocean climate affect species dominance and fish 
populations at the coastal margins of the Pacific 
Rim.  Several national programs are underway or 
have been proposed for most of these regions 
(PICES Scientific Report No. 4). 
 
Common Set of Program Outputs 
 
The implementation plan identified a common set 
of program outputs required for successful 
comparison of ecosystem properties and responses 
to climate variability embodied in the following 
four Central Scientific Issues.  
 
1. Physical forcing:  What are the characteristics 
of climate variability;  can interdecadal 
patterns be identified;  how and when do they 
arise?  
- Location of major fronts/current 
boundaries 
- Atmospheric pressure gradients (winds 
and storms) 
- Air-sea heat exchange (insolation, cloud 
cover) 
- Major physical features (e.g., fresh water 
input, ice) 
- Mixed layer temperature (MLT), depth 
(MLD) 
- Velocity of major currents 
- Eddies 
- Vertical and horizontal mixing, fine 
structure 
- Nutrients in MLD and / or pycnocline 
 
2. Lower trophic level response:  How do 
primary and secondary producers respond in 
productivity, and in species and size 
composition, to climate variability in different 
ecosystems of the North Pacific? 
- Annual and seasonal productivity 
- Temporal and spatial pattern of plankton 
dynamics and nutrient fields 
- Identification of major taxonomic groups 
- Population parameters for key species (or 
taxonomic groups) 
 
3. Higher trophic level response:  How do life 
history patterns, distributions, vital rates, and 
population dynamics of higher trophic level 
species respond directly and indirectly to 
climate variability? 
- Abundance trends and distributions of life 
stages of key species and their predators 
and prey 
- Population parameters (growth, mortality, 
reproduction) 
 
 
83
- Food web structure (including diets and 
trophodynamic linkages of key species) 
- Production and productivity structure 
 
4. Ecosystem interactions:  How are North 
Pacific ecosystems structured?  Do higher 
trophic levels respond to climate variability 
solely as a consequence of bottom-up forcing?  
Are there significant intra-trophic level and 
top-down effects on lower trophic level 
production and on energy transfer 
efficiencies? 
 
The REX Task Team identified two outputs that 
could be added to items that could be added to the 
list above.  
- Species diversity of lower trophic and higher 
trophic level organisms (under items 2 and 3 
above). 
- Total lower trophic level production available 
for higher trophic level consumers (under item 
2 above). 
 
These data outputs are required as data inputs to 
ecosystem models, indicators of mechanisms, or will 
serve as parameter estimates for models.  The phase/ 
function of these outputs in research activities should 
be specified.  The REX Task Team will work with 
the PICES Technical Committee on Data Exchange 
(TCODE) to review the availability of information 
for each of the program outputs and to provide 
access to existing sources. 
 
Terms of Reference 
 
A principal purpose of the REX Task Team is to 
promote the intercomparison of regional 
experiments. To accomplish this goal REX must 
strive to ensure that a common set of outputs is 
produced that will form the basis of meaningful 
inter-regional comparisons.  The proposed terms of 
reference for the REX Task Team include: 
 
1. The REX Task Team will be responsible for 
promoting and coordinating research activities 
related to the CCCC program among member 
nations.  This goal could be accomplished by 
convening meetings or distributing 
information designed to foster cooperation 
among existing or developing programs;  
2. The REX Task Team will foster 
communication among PICES members 
regarding advancements in scientific method 
or research findings.  This may be achieved 
through written communi-cations (e.g. 
newsletters, home pages, or e-mail communi-
cations), and by convening periodic scientific 
symposiums or workshops. Communication 
and data exchange that will be coordinated 
jointly through REX and TCODE;  
 
3. The REX Task Team will encourage 
establishment of component programs where 
needed; 
 
4. The REX Task Team will identify linkages 
between regional studies and basin scale 
studies; and  
 
Among these, 1 and 2 will benefit component 
programs of REX, and 3 and 4 will be CCCC 
specific activities.  
 
Recommended Regional Experiments  
 
The design and implementation of research activities 
in coastal regions of the PICES area is determined 
by the national research programs of each member 
nation. The role of the REX Task Team is to identify 
aspects of the national programs that would benefit 
from coordination with other PICES member 
nations.  The following activities are recommended 
to provide data sets that could be utilized for 
inter-regional comparisons.  They are broken into 
four major research activities:  monitoring, 
retrospective studies, modeling and process oriented 
studies.  In all cases, communication between 
nations will be required to ensure that the data 
collections are made in a consistent manner using a 
standardized research protocol that is agreeable 
among member nations.  
 
 
MONITORING 
 
Monitoring programs are needed to acquire 
observations of physical, chemical and biological 
 
 
84
aspects of the environment to support investigations 
of interannual variability over an extended period of 
time.  Activities recommended in this section should 
be considered in conjunction with the PICES 
Monitoring Working Group (WG 9).  PICES WG 9 
is responsible for planning the monitoring activities 
in the PICES area.  WG 9's activities will include 
proposing scientific and technical priorities and 
schedules, and designing methods to collect 
physical, biological and chemical measurements 
(PICES Scientific Report No. 3).  The design and 
implemen-tation of the PICES-GLOBEC CCCC 
monitoring program should be coordinated with 
existing international planning efforts of outside 
agencies such as the Ocean Observing System 
Development Panel (OOSDP) and Global Ocean 
Observing System (GOOS). 
 
Transects 
 
Observations of physical and biological parameters 
should be made along a few key cross-shelf transects 
(sampled every other month, and more frequently 
during critical periods).  This approach was proposed 
by the Subarctic Working Group (WG 6) (PICES 
Scientific Report No. 1).  The bimonthly sampling 
interval may be inadequate to resolve the dynamics 
of the shorter lived zooplankton that are potential 
prey of the higher trophic level species.  A study 
could be conducted to determine the sampling 
frequency required to capture low frequency 
variations in ocean conditions.  The following 
measurements could be made at the cross-shelf 
transects:  1) current speed and direction, 2) 
temperature and salinity profiles, 3) measurements 
of nutrients, 4) chlorophyll concen-tration and 
particle size distribution, 5) micro and macro 
zooplankton abundance and species composition, 6) 
micronekton collections.  Current speed and 
direction could be measured using Acoustic Doppler 
Current Profiler (ADCP).  Temperature and salinity 
data should be collected using hull mounted probes 
and regularly spaced CTDs.  Chlorophyll 
measurements would occur using a fluorometer or a 
spectrophotometer (such as a chlorophyll absorption 
meter) which would be dropped at each CTD station. 
Zooplankton abundance would be continuously 
monitored using multi-frequency acoustics.  Net 
sampling would occur to verify acoustic sign types 
and to establish the species composition.   
 
 
It should be noted that observations along repeated 
lines are presently being collected by most of the 
PICES member nations.  We encourage these nations 
to continue this effort, and promote efforts to expand 
current sampling to include collection of biological 
data. 
 
Moorings 
 
The detailed transect data should be complemented 
with continuous time series ADCP, acoustics, 
bio-optics, and physics measured from a small 
number of moorings, to prevent aliasing of the data, 
and to capture large spatial amplitude events that 
occur during the interval between transects.  It is 
desirable for these moorings be equipped to measure 
acoustic backscatter, preferably at multiple 
frequencies, to provide an estimate of zooplankton 
biomass (and perhaps size), light and fluorescence 
sensors (to measure phytoplankton stocks), and 
sensors to measure nutrients.  Sediment traps might 
also be placed near moorings to monitor production 
cycles and to measure the amount of production 
energy that reaches the sea floor.  Inflow through 
narrow passages could be effectively monitored by 
measuring electro-magnetic current along submarine 
telephone cables.  
 
Whenever possible moorings should be placed in 
"pulse" points to capture key ecosystem features. 
Pulse points are locations that exhibit characteristics 
that have historically indicated, or significantly 
influenced, the status of marine ecosystems.  Pulse 
points may be located at the confluence or 
bifurcation of major current systems.  Pulse points 
can also be located in regions occupied during key 
life history stages of the target species (e.g. spawning 
locations of major fish species).  
 
Remote Sensing 
 
Remote sensing could be used where possible to 
measure surface productivity and mesoscale ocean 
features.  Geostrophic currents or their variability 
can be resolved using satellite altimetery.  Likewise 
 
 
85
ocean color can be used to monitor surface 
productivity and ocean temperature.  Measures of 
wind stress, sea ice extent and insolation can also be 
measured using remote sensing equipment.  While 
collection of this information will not be an activity, 
the analysis of such data will be a necessary activity 
of scientists participating in the CCCC program. 
 
Satellite-tracked buoys 
 
Satellite-tracked buoys should be deployed at a few 
pulse points to resolve mesoscale circulation features 
(eddies) and to resolve the flow direction and speed. 
These measurements will be utilized to ground truth 
physical models of the coastal regions. 
 
Freshwater Runoff 
 
In northern regions, freshwater inflow has a strong 
impact on the upper mixed layer of coastal 
ecosystems.  Knowledge of the salinity distribution 
is required to provide accurate estimates of the 
geostrophic transport in the region.  Direct measures 
of freshwater runoff (stream gauges) or indices of 
freshwater runoff should be developed for the CCCC 
program.   
 
Acoustic Trawl / Bottom or Mid-water Trawl 
Fish Surveys, and Commercial Fisheries 
Monitoring 
 
The agencies and universities of many nations 
conduct bottom - trawl and/or hydroacoustic 
midwater trawl surveys of the coastal regions of the 
North Pacific. These surveys provide an excellent 
opportunity to enhance the CCCC monitoring effort.  
In addition, member nations often monitor the age 
composition, length, weight and maturity of fish 
obtained from samples of commercial fisheries 
catch.  
 
PICES Coastal Pelagic Fishes Working Group (WG 
3) made several recommendations regarding the use 
of data collected on major fish stocks (PICES 
Scientific Report No. 1).  Many of these recommen-
dations are relevant to the PICES CCCC program 
and should be included in the design of the regional 
experiments. Fishery information should include the 
following annual data:  stock size, commercial catch, 
and recruitment estimates, estimates of size at age 
and weight at age.  Survey data should provide 
information on the distribution, species composition 
and abundance of fish. 
 
Information on populations of seabirds and marine 
mammals is needed for the CCCC program.  Some 
nations monitor seabird and marine mammal 
populations.  Likewise information on the diet and 
size or weight of seabirds and pinniped populations 
is often collected.  More detailed information on the 
foraging behavior of pinnipeds could be collected by 
placing satellite transmitters on animals. 
 
Vital Biological Rates 
 
A considerable amount of information regarding the 
relative health of the ecosystem can be inferred from 
analysis of vital rates such as annual and daily 
growth (length and weight), maturation schedules, 
fecundity, and birth/spawn dates.  Collection of this 
type of information should be conducted whenever 
possible to provide time series for comparative 
studies.  More detailed information regarding the 
relative health of an organism can be obtained from 
histological comparisons of tissue samples or studies 
of RNA/DNA ratios.   
 
Ships of Opportunity 
 
Ships of opportunity should be used to expand 
geographic coverage beyond that of the transect 
and mooring locations.  Ships of opportunity could 
be equipped with automated flow through systems 
that allow underway sampling.  These automated 
devices would enable the collection of 
measurements of temperature, salinity, 
chlorophyll-a, nitrate, pCO
2
, total CO
2
, and pH.  
TCODE and the PICES Secretariat plan to 
accumulate information on cruise schedules for 
each member nation.  These schedules should have 
include information required to facilitate 
coordination in multi-national ecosystem 
monitoring.  
 
Large-scale monitoring  
 
Large scale physical monitoring is needed to 
evaluate how variability in atmospheric forcing 
 
 
86
influences ocean conditions.  Key measurements 
would be the position and strength of major storm 
tracks, pressure gradients and derived winds, 
circulation and water mass characteristics of the 
CCCC region.  This is needed to document the 
effects of large scale forcing on the productivity of 
the coastal systems, and on the distribution, growth 
and survival of upper trophic level organisms and 
their prey in the coastal environment.  Monitoring of 
the entire subarctic Pacific basin will require a 
coordinated multinational effort and should include 
input from the BASS Task Team of the PICES 
CCCC IP.  Large scale physical monitoring would be 
achieved through a combination of remote sensing, 
and atmospheric models.  The large-scale circulation 
of the North Pacific could be examined using a 
combination of PALACE floats, satellite track 
drifters and satellite altimetry.  
PALACE floats are programmed to follow a density 
surface (perhaps at 800-1000 m depth).  Periodically 
they are programmed rise to the surface, allowing 
the collection of  high-quality temperature, salinity 
and pressure profiles.  Hydrographic data is 
transmitted via ARGOS transmitters while the floats 
are at the surface.  
 
 
RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES 
 
The PICES CCCC Science Plan (PICES Scientific 
Report No. 4) defines retrospective studies as 
analyses of existing atmospheric, physical, 
biological and paleoceanographic data, to identify 
recent (and historical) changes in the subarctic 
Pacific. Retrospective studies are a high priority for 
the CCCC program.  They are necessary to refine 
hypotheses regarding climate influences on marine 
ecosystems. Retrospective studies will also assist in 
the design of comparative studies between regions.  
Nine activities are recommended in the Science Plan.   
 
1. Examine atmospheric and physical oceano-
graphic time series in eastern and western 
Pacific to determine if regime shifts 
occurred and if these shifts were 
synchronous across the North Pacific. 
 
2. Examine long-term plankton and fisheries 
records from the eastern and western 
Pacific for shifts in species composition 
and biomass changes, and determine if 
these changes are synchronous on both 
sides of the Pacific. 
 
 
3. Analyze plankton and higher trophic level 
carnivore biomass data from the North Pacific 
ecosystems to determine the average slope and 
intercept of the biomass spectra for different 
ocean regimes. 
 
4. Examine the statistical evidence for a link 
between variations in ocean conditions, 
plankton, and catches of key fish stocks, and 
investigate the relationship between fish 
catches and total production, or recruitment. 
 
5. Reconstruct interdecadal- through- centennial 
scale variability in biological populations and 
associated environmental changes for the past 
two millennia. 
 
6. Examine historical variations in salmon 
growth through the analysis of their scale 
patterns. 
 
7. Conduct comparative studies of somatic 
growth of fish populations around the Pacific 
Rim. 
 
8. Compare the dynamics of coastal fish stocks 
of the North Pacific. 
 
9. Examine how physical forcing affects the 
subarctic Pacific marine mammal (e.g. harbor 
seals and sea lions) and seabird populations 
via changes in the abundance and availability 
of their food. 
 
Implementation of many of these studies, and studies 
like them, is dependent on:  identifying  principal 
data sources that could be utilized, obtaining the data 
sets required, and evaluating the methods used to 
collect the historical data sets to enable 
standardization. These tasks should be coordinated 
with the on-going efforts of TCODE.  Efforts to 
reconstruct historical time series of fish populations 
through analysis of sediment cores will require a 
 
 
87
multi-national effort to locate regions where anoxic 
sediments exist. 
   
We recommend that REX should cooperate with 
other programs to facilitate the exchange of methods, 
data and results.  For example, the GLOBEC 
International - Small Pelagic fish and Climate 
Change (SPACC) program recently recommended 
that comparative studies on the variability and 
production of sardine and anchovy should be 
initiated.  These comparative studies will be relevant 
to the REX Task Team.   
 
 
MODELING 
 
The PICES CCCC Science Plan calls for four 
types of modeling activities: 
 
1. Develop a variety of foodweb formulations 
representing the appropriate dynamic 
ecosystem properties of interest to 
PICES-GLOBEC. 
 
2. Combine the various formulations of foodweb 
models in one-dimensional mixed layer 
models forced by surface wind, heat and 
moisture exchanges typical of the subarctic 
Pacific, on time-scales from hours to years. 
 
3. Combine mixed layer dynamics and foodweb 
models in the three dimensional circulation 
models, and run retrospective simulations of 
the last 30-50 years with observed 
atmospheric inputs. 
 
4. Develop second generation models to generate 
projections of physical and biological 
responses to possible future climate variation 
and large scale environmental change. 
 
International coordination of model development 
will be facilitated by the CCCC MODEL Task Team.  
The MODEL Task Team convened a workshop in 
Nemuro Japan in June 1996.  During this workshop 
several ongoing modeling activities outside of 
PICES were identified.  Efforts to encourage the use, 
or modifi-cation, of existing models to address the 
scientific issues relevant to the REX Task Team will 
be an important goal.  
 
 
PROCESS ORIENTED STUDIES 
 
Process oriented studies must be developed after the 
key species of study have been identified.  Key 
species have been identified in only a few GLOBEC 
proposals.  Once target species have been noted, 
REX will attempt to identify research approaches 
that would facilitate regional comparisons. 
 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
1. We recommend that a community outreach 
subcommittee should be established.  This sub-
committee will be responsible for reviewing the 
science plans and program objectives of 
GLOBEC-like programs to identify the potential 
for cooperative research.   
 
2. Comparative retrospective studies are critical 
for the success of the REX Task Team.  
Retrospective studies could be initiated 
immediately because they do not require large 
financial commitments from the member 
nations.  Data sets must be made available to 
scientists from the member nations in order to 
accomplish this goal.  REX recognizes that 
TCODE has the responsibility for obtaining, 
assembling, and documenting data series that 
could be used in the retrospective studies.  The 
REX Task Team strongly encourages TCODE 
to place high priority on accomplishing this 
responsibility.   
 
3. The REX Task Team, in consultation with the 
BASS Task Team and WG 9 propose a 
workshop to be convened prior to the PICES 
Annual Meeting in 1997.  The purpose of the 
workshop will be to:  a) identify and prioritize 
desired retrospective and process oriented 
research programs that could be conducted to 
allow regional comparisons;  b) standardize 
plankton sampling methods;  c) identify key 
species within the 10 REX regions;  and d) 
 
 
88
identify methods for monitoring the 
distribution and abundance of selected species. 
 
Prior to the meeting a background document will be 
prepared.  These background documents should 
include summaries of GLOBEC-like programs 
including the key scientific hypotheses being 
addressed.  Summaries of existing biological and 
physical datasets or models (e.g. ECOPATH, 
individual based models or circulation models) will 
also be prepared.  These data summaries will be 
obtained in coordination with TCODE.  Preferably, 
summaries of existing data will be presented in 
tabular form to illustrate areas where monitoring 
systems may be required.  Participants will be 
expected to be ready to propose comparative studies 
at this meeting.
