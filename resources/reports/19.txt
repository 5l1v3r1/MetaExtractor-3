1  Summary 
 
Changes in the abundance of commercially 
important crustaceans in the North Pacific led 
PICES to form Working Group 12 in 1997.  
Objectives were to identify important North 
Pacific crustacean stocks, to describe historical 
changes in their abundance, to identify current 
research programs on them, and to clarify 
mechanisms that might account for their observed 
patterns of abundance.  The PICES Region 
includes almost all of FAO Statistical Areas 61 
and 67 and a small portion of Area 71.  The 
Region in 1998 provided 48% of world crab 
landings and 45% of world shrimp landings, 
excluding data from North Korea.  
 
The world-wide importance of the PICES Region 
with respect to crustaceans has been increasing 
over the last 15 years, with crab and shrimp 
landings increasing at an annual compound rate of 
7.8% and 8.2%, respectively.  Of the 48 crustacean 
species that have accounted for commercial 
fisheries landings in the PICES Region, 33, or 
69%, are endemic to it.  
 
Five FAO species groupings (16 species in four 
families) make up 79% of crab landings in the 
PICES Region. Four of these are brachyurans and 
the other is an anomuran (king crabs).  The gazami 
crab (Portunidae, Portunus trituburculatus) fishery 
in the Yellow Sea area alone represented 39.5% of 
landings over this period.  Harvested snow and 
Tanner crabs (Majidae, Chionoecetes spp.) include 
five species. Landings of king crabs (Lithodidae) 
include three species of Paralithodes and two 
species of Lithodes.  The Dungeness crab (Cancer 
magister) is the largest cancrid in the Pacific and 
supports an important eastern Pacific inshore 
fishery from the eastern Aleutian Islands south to 
California. Hair crab (Erimacrus isenbeckii), rock 
crabs (Cancer spp.) and sheep crab (Loxorynchus 
grandus) provide small fisheries in the PICES 
Region, but except for hair crab, fisheries are 
poorly documented. 
 
Three families of shrimps are commercially 
important in the PICES Region, and their landings 
have made up 93.8% of shrimp landings within the 
PICES Region over the last 15 years.  Sergestidae 
includes the akiami paste shrimp (Acetes chinensis 
and Acetes japonica), that supports the largest 
shrimp fishery in the PICES Region, as well as the 
world.  Penaeidae occur in the waters of China, 
Korea and southern Japan, and major fisheries 
exploit Kuruma shrimp/prawn (Marsupenaeus 
japonicus);  the cocktail, or southern rough shrimp 
(Trachysalambria curvirostrus);  fleshy prawn 
(Fenneropenaeus chinensis) and Shiba shrimp 
(Metapenaeus joyneri).  The Pandalidae include 
the genera Pandalus and Pandalopsis and this 
family accounts for virtually all shrimp landings 
from northern Japan around the North Pacific rim 
to California.  In terms of volume, the northern 
shrimp (Pandalus borealis, or eos) and the ocean 
shrimp (Pandalus jordani) have been most 
important economically, although six additional 
species have contributed substantially to the catch 
in various areas.  There have been some recent 
attempts to exploit deepwater glass shrimps, 
Family Pasiphaeidae.  Other species of shrimp 
such as many Crangonidae, which provide 
important commercial fisheries in the northeast 
Atlantic, are present in the PICES Region but are 
only harvested to a minor extent or as incidental 
catch. 
 
Mantis shrimps, stomatopods (Squillidae) that are 
not closely related to the more familiar decapod 
shrimps, are briefly discussed for 
comprehensiveness, although the only species 
commercially exploited is Oratosquilla oratoria in 
the Bohai Sea.  Mantis shrimps are widely 
distributed in Chinese waters and are also found 
around Korea and Japan, where they used to be 
historically more important.  Spiny lobsters 
(Decapoda, Palinuridae) are exploited in Japan, 
South Korea, and China (Palinurus japonicus), 
and in California (P. interruptus).

2  Introduction 
 
Interest in a working group was prompted by large 
changes in the abundance of commercially fished 
crabs and shrimps that occurred in various areas of 
the PICES Region.  Working Group 12 (WG 12) 
was established by the Governing Council in 
October 1995 upon the recommendation of the 
Fisheries Science Committee (FIS).  Many 
changes in crustacean abundance have been of 
considerable economic importance and affected 
large geographic areas.  For example, red king 
crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) was a mainstay 
of commercial fishing in the Gulf of Alaska 
(GOA) in the 1960s and 1970s, but almost all of 
the GOA has been closed to commercial fishing 
for red king crab from 1983 onward due to low 
stock abundance.  At the same time red king crab 
abundance in the Sea of Okhotsk remained high 
and fishing continued unabated.  This example 
illustrates that trends in stock abundance within 
species, and presumably mechanisms responsible 
for changes in abundance, are not homogeneous 
within the PICES Region.  A major portion of WG 
12’s work was to assemble a first catalog of North 
Pacific crustacean stocks and their patterns of 
changing abundance, as part of an underlying 
effort to elucidate mechanisms of change in 
various species or species groups. 
 
This report summarizes the results of four 
meetings that were held in Nanaimo, Canada 
(1996);  Nemuro, Japan (1997);  Fairbanks, USA 
(1998);  and Qingdao, China (1999).  Details of 
attendance and national representation are 
contained in Appendix 1 and 2. 
 
2.1 Terms of Reference 
 
The Governing Council established Working 
Group 12 upon the recommendation of the Fishery 
Science Committee using the following language: 
 
“Because of recent changes in the abundance of 
crabs and shrimps and their economic 
consequences in the PICES region, the Working 
Group is established to: 
 
- Identify the persons performing scientific 
work on the distribution, recruitment, larval 
transport, migration, population dynamics, and 
influences of environmental conditions for 
crabs and shrimp in the PICES region. 
 
- Identify data that are available that would 
assist in the analyses of factors affecting 
abundance trends. 
 
- Review current knowledge of factors affecting 
abundance and survival of crabs and shrimp 
and identify the key scientific questions 
relating to the understanding of the reasons for 
abundance fluctuations. 
 
- Exchange data on the abundance of crabs and 
shrimp stocks in the PICES region.” 
 
Terms of reference evolved over the course of WG 
12 deliberations because of: 
 
- The vast number of crab and shrimp species in 
the North Pacific, and the resultant need to 
focus on a relatively few key species.  These 
species provide an array of complex life 
histories and habitat requirements that provide 
contrasts when examining natural and/or 
anthropogenic causes of varying abundance. 
 
- The large number of researchers involved to 
some extent with at least some of the 
identified species.  WG 12 felt a need to 
restrict the scale of its mandate and identify 
researchers and institutions through citation.  
WG 12 effectively limited the terms “crabs” 
and “shrimps” to mean those species that were 
currently fished or which could be fished 
using conventional methods from other parts 
of the world.  The very large group that study 
crabs and shrimps in general was hence 
reduced to those working with fishery related 
forms.  This was, in part, necessary because 
trends in abundance are so seldom available 
for unfished species. 
 
- Additionally, in 1997 we received information 
on the Japanese spiny lobster that indicated 
some importance in the PICES Region and 
further noted omission of the California spiny 
lobster.  Both these species were 
3
 
recommended and accepted for inclusion in 
the terms of reference.  This action effectively 
enlarged WG 12’s mandate to include all 
harvested crustaceans in the PICES Region.  
The taxonomy of species contained in this 
report is reviewed in Appendix 3 and 
individual stocks are listed in Appendix 4. 
  
Accordingly the final terms of reference were: 
 
- Consider those crabs, shrimps and lobsters that 
are utilized in commercial, subsistence or 
recreational fisheries.  This may include 
introduced species if they are directly 
important or impact human utilization of any 
other marine species.  
 
- Identify persons through citation from each 
country that are performing scientific work on 
the distribution, recruitment, larval transport, 
migration, population dynamics, and 
influences of environmental conditions for 
crabs and shrimps.  
 
- Identify data that are available that would 
assist in the analyses of factors affecting 
abundance trends. 
 
- Review and exchange current knowledge and 
data concerning factors affecting abundance 
and survival of crabs, shrimps and spiny 
lobsters and identify key scientific questions 
regarding reasons for abundance fluctuations.

2.2 An Overview of Crustaceans in the 
PICES Region 
 
The PICES Region contains large proportions of 
the world’s crab and shrimp resources.  It is not 
always possible to precisely quantify landings of 
these resources from available statistics.  At the 
meeting in Qingdao, it was decided that the East 
China Sea should be included and that 24°N would 
be an appropriate biologically-based southern 
boundary for crustaceans in Asia (Fig. 1).  
Unfortunately, fishery landing statistics have not 
always been available north and south of this 
latitude.  The PICES Region (basically north of 
30
o
N) encompasses all of FAO Area 67 (Northeast 
Pacific), a small part of Area 77 (Eastern Central 
Pacific) and most of Area 61 (Northwest Pacific 
south to 20°N) (Fig. 1).  As an approximation, 
landings from the PICES Region would include all 
landings in Area 67, only U.S. landings from Area 
77, and summed landings from Chinese, Japanese, 
North Korean, South Korean and Russian marine 
waters from Area 61.  There is no fixed boundary 
for the PICES Region, and so we referred to these 
FAO statistical areas as the PICES Region for the 
purposes of this document.  With this caveat, in 
1998 the PICES Region provided 48% of world 
crab landings (Table 1) and 45% of world shrimp 
landings (Table 2).  
 
In all cases we tried to refer landings or other 
fisheries statistics to FAO or some other database 
available through the worldwide web or standard 
publications of various agencies.  All FAO capture 
production (wild harvest) figures for 1984-1998 
are from the FAO Fisheries Department, Fishery 
Information Data and Statistics Unit, and 
FISHSTAT Plus, universal software for statistical 
time series, Version 2.3 2000.  This is accessed 
through www.fao.org/waicent/faoinfo/fishery/struct/ 
fidi.asp.  Earlier FAO statistics are from annual 
reports that may include some aquacultural 
production in FAO Area 67. 
 
In both relative and absolute terms, the importance 
of the PICES Region has increased greatly over 
the past 15 years of record.  Reported weight of 
crabs landed in the PICES Region (Fig. 2)

increased at an annual compound rate of 7.8% (R
2
 
= 0.87) from 1984 to 1998 as compared to world 
increases at a 6.8% (R
2
 = 0.95) compound rate 
over the same period.  Reported weight of shrimps 
in the PICES Region (Fig. 3) increased at a 
compound rate of 8.2% (R
2
 = 0.93) while world 
landings were more stable, increasing at 2.6% (R
2
 
= 0.87).  Most growth in crab fisheries took place 
in China, which accounted for 37.5% of PICES 
Region crab landings over the past 15 years of 
record.  Unfortunately, large amounts of Chinese 
landings have been listed as “crabs nei” (nei = not 
elsewhere included) or “crustaceans nei”, and the 
true magnitude of China’s crab landings remains 
unknown and speculative.  Some apparent 
increases in crab landings are due to improved 
reporting whereby a species is now listed 
individually rather than grouped in some large 
taxonomic bin.

areas from 1990-1994.

areas from 1990-1994

areas from 1958-1994. 
Many crab and shrimp landings are included only 
as unspecified crustaceans (Fig. 4).  For example, 
UN/FAO statistics list only “unspecified 
crustaceans” for North Korea.  By consequence, 
our knowledge of stocks or stock structure in 
transboundary areas such as the Yellow Sea 
(China-North Korea-South Korea) and the 
Japan/East Sea (Japan-North Korea-South Korea-
Russia) is incomplete.  Only about 60% by weight 
of the total marine crustaceans landed in the 
PICES Region over the years 1984 - 1998 are 
identified by species or narrowly defined species 
group (e.g. king crabs).  This percentage has 
ranged from 48% (1984) to 67% (1967) and has 
been fairly static.  In general, shrimp fisheries 
(92% identified to species or group) were better 
defined than crab fisheries (79% identified).  A 
large portion of crustacean landings in the PICES 
Region (35%) was identified only as 
miscellaneous crustaceans.  Incomplete or lacking 
fishery statistics (even at the level of landings by 
species or species group over broad areas) 
frequently hampered WG 12 efforts to define 
stocks or elucidate patterns of changing 
abundance.  Nevertheless, fishery statistics were 
found to be the only useful series for evaluating 
stock abundance in many areas. 
 
A list of exploited and potentially exploited 
species (Appendix 3) was compiled at the first 
meeting and has been updated during subsequent 
meetings.  This list served as a basis of discussion 
because little published literature was available on 
abundance trends for species of little commercial 
importance or potential, even though their 
ecological importance may be well established 
6
 
(e.g., Lang 1992;  Livingston 1988, 1989, 1991;  
Livingston and Goiney 1983;  Livingston and 
deRaynier 1996;  Livingston et al. 1993;  
Wakabayashi 1986).  As a matter of preference, 
we agreed to use taxonomic nomenclature 
published by the American Fisheries Society 
(Williams et al. 1989) first and that used by FAO 
second.  Occasionally we have used other names 
for species that are not named in either of these 
two sources.  WG 12 also noted that the taxonomic 
diversity included in the terms “crabs and 
shrimps” is daunting.  For example, The American 
Fisheries Society (Williams et al. 1989) lists 186 
species of shrimps in 19 families that occur on the 
Pacific Coasts of the United States and Canada.  
Of these, four families are landed in commercial 
fisheries in aggregate, but specific statistical data 
are available for only 15 species, of which eight 
are Pandalidae (see below).  Here we also note that 
the northern shrimp in the Pacific Ocean is 
frequently referred to as Pandalus eos, but also as 
Pandalus borealis in the Atlantic and Pacific 
Oceans.  WG 12 recognizes that there is some 
controversy here and that on-going DNA studies 
will likely resolve the matter.  Similarly, there are 
about 51 species of penaeid shrimps and about 40 
species of swimming crabs (Portunidae) in the 
East China Sea, but we discussed only three 
penaeids and one portunid in our meetings due to 
the lack of data for most species.  
  
Commercially important stocks, or those with 
reasonable fishery potential, were grouped by 
species and geographic area (Appendix 4).  These 
were then classified as to their fishery size (or 
long-term fishery potential), trends in abundance, 
type of fishery development and degree of 
development.  Conventionally fished crab and 
shrimp stocks in North America and Asia ranging 
from the Japan/East Sea northward are at or near 
full exploitation, with the possible exception of a 
few shrimp stocks in the Russian Far East.  Crabs 
and shrimps in the Bohai and Yellow Seas are 
fully exploited, while those in the East China Sea 
may still have some potential for fishery 
expansion.  We chose species or stocks for in-
depth discussion based on population exploitation, 
unique management approach, differences in 
patterns of abundance, known population 
fluctuations, and quality or quantity of data.  A 
commentary on every species or species 
population in Appendix 4 could not be presented.  
Emphasis was given to those populations or stocks 
that showed contrasts and best illustrated patterns 
of abundance in various geographic areas. 
 
There were many possible between-area 
comparisons of population fluctuations that we 
identified but did not have the resources to pursue.  
For example, the Yellow Sea to the west of Korea 
is relatively unique within the PICES Region.  
This part of the Yellow Sea has a tropical fauna 
with several well-described, exploited crustacean 
populations that could be contrasted with those of 
nearby temperate or boreal species found in the 
Japan/East Sea just to the east of Korea.  The two 
faunal groups are separated only by a short 
distance at the tip of the Korean Peninsula and 
hence potentially provide a unique opportunity to 
study the comparative effects of large-scale 
climatic variables.  Unfortunately, data available 
to us for these temperate-boreal species complexes 
are much less than complete, in part, because data 
are lacking from North Korea.  
 
North Pacific zoological provinces (Fig. 1) 
described in Allen and Smith (1988) for finfish 
were used by WG 12 to structure many of its 
discussions.  This classification applies only to 
shelf and mesobenthyal (200 - 500 m) slope waters 
though, and zoogeographic provinces in deeper 
waters are not necessarily the same.  Never the 
less, we found Allen and Smith’s classification 
useful and recommend it highly.  Their 
zoogeographic provinces follow from those of 
earlier workers studying various taxa (summarized 
by Ekman 1953 and Briggs 1974) and are 
compatible with recent work on American 
decapod crustaceans (Boschi 2000).  All authors 
recognize an Arctic Zoogeographic Region (AR) 
that is of recent geologic origin and has served to 
separate the Eastern Boreal Pacific Region (EBPR, 
at Cape Olyutorskiy) from the Western Boreal 
Pacific Region (WBPR, at Nunivak Island).  To 
the south it is convenient to recognize a Western 
Pacific Southern Region (WPSR), divided at 
approximately the latitude of the Strait of Korea, 
and an Eastern Pacific Southern Region (EPSR), 
divided at approximately Point Conception.  There 
are transitional zones, faunal overlaps and various 
defined provinces within these regions.

From the simplified perspective of these five 
regions within the overall PICES Region and 
considering the 48 species listed in Appendix 3, 
we note that 33 species, or 69%, are endemic to 
the PICES Region.  For example, endemic species 
include all king crabs, all the Tanner crabs except 
snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio), all the rock crabs 
and all the northern shrimps (Pandalidae) except 
possibly Pandalus borealis/eos.  In the boreal 
regions (EPBR, WPBR), 19 species are amphi-
Pacific, of which 14 are endemic to the PICES 
Region, while in the southern regions, no species 
are amphi-Pacific and only two are endemic.  
Taken individually, the AR and SEPR have no 
endemic species, the SWPR has 2 endemic species 
(17%), WPBR has 4 endemic species (16%) and 
the EPBR has 8 endemic species (27%).  The 
southern regions owe their affinities to widespread 
tropical faunas while endemism is concentrated in 
temperate to boreal areas. 
 
While there is an intractably large body of 
literature on North Pacific crustaceans, recent 
symposia, workshop proceedings, and published 
bibliographies provide a wealth of readily 
available sources.  Those noted in particular are 
the University of Alaska’s Lowell Wakefield 
Symposium series that has included:  pandalid 
shrimps in 1979 (Frady 1981), “the genus 
Chionoecetes” in 1982 (Anonymous 1982), king 
crab in 1985 (Anonymous 1985a), Dungeness crab 
in 1985 (Anonymous 1985b), king and Tanner 
crabs in 1989 (Anonymous 1990), and, “high 
latitude crabs” in 1995 (Anonymous 1996).  In 
2001 and still unpublished, there was a symposium 
on “crabs in cold water regions” that will become 
part of this series.  Some of these Proceedings are

Conferences/symposia.html).  
 
The 1996 symposium also resulted in an extensive 
bibliography on snow crab (Paul 2000), which 
follows a tradition of Lowell Wakefield symposia 
leading to bibliographies, such as those on king 
and Tanner crabs (Bowerman et al. 1983), the 
genus Chionoecetes (Bowerman and Melteff 
1984) and world king crabs (Dawson and 
Yaldwyn 1985, Dawson 1989).  Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada sponsored several meetings of 
particular interest:  an invertebrate assessment and 
management workshop in 1984 (Jamieson and 
Bourne 1986), an international workshop on snow 
crab biology in 1987 (Jamieson and McKone 
1988), and a second invertebrate assessment and 
management symposium in 1995 (Jamieson and 
Campbell 1998).  These proceedings contain much 
useful information on North Pacific crustaceans, 
as well as other invertebrate fisheries, and the 
1987 workshop is particularly relevant to the issue 
of terminal molting of male snow and tanner crabs 
in the genus Chionoecetes. 
 
The California Department of Fish and Game 
published a review of Dungeness crab biology that 
is very useful, particularly regarding the southern 
limits of this crab’s range (Wild and Tasto 1983).  
Orensanz et al. (1998) provides an extensive 
bibliography in their review of crustacean fisheries 
in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  Abe (1992) 
provided a summary of literature on the crab 
resources of Hokkaido.  Bergström (2000) and 
Komai (1999) provided recent and comprehensive 
literature reviews of the genus Pandalus.  The 
Symposium “Pandalid Shrimp Fisheries - Science 
and Management at the Millennium”, was held in, 
Dartmouth, Nova Scotia in September, 1999, and 
was sponsored by NAFO, ICES and PICES, with 
96 participants from 15 countries (Koeller et al. 
2000). 
 
With the advent of computerized internet literature 
searches, huge amounts of published information 
are now readily available.  We found the 
Cambridge Scientific Internet database 
(www.csa.com/csa/about/about-csa.shtml) very 
useful.  Other pertinent sites include:  Pacific 
States Marine Fisheries Commission for landings 
and status (www.psmfc.org/pacfin/6-1.html), the 
North Pacific Fishery Management Council 
(www.fakr.noaa.gov/npfmc/default.htm), Informa-

3  Major Species and Stocks of Crabs in the PICES Region  
 
According to FAO statistics, five species or 
species groups of crabs within the PICES Region 
made up 78.5% of reported landings over the past 
15 years (Table 3).  Four of these are brachyurans 
and the other is an anomuran (king crabs).  The 
gazami crab (Portunidae, Portunus 
trituburculatus) alone represented 39.5% of 
landings over this period.  Snow, or Tanner, crabs  
(Majidae, Chionoecetes spp.) include five species.  
The Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) is the 
largest cancrid in the Pacific and supports an 
important eastern Pacific inshore fishery from the 
eastern Aleutian Islands south to California.  
Landings of king crabs (Lithodidae) include three 
species of Paralithodes and two species of 
Lithodes.  “Other crabs” refers almost entirely to 
the portunid crab Portunus pelagicus.  Portunid 
crabs dominate world crab landings and it is 
testimony to their high productivity that portunid 
landings also dominate the PICES Region, even 
though they inhabit only a small part of it.

3.1  Gazami crab (Portunus trituburculatus, 
Portunidae, FAO:  GAZ, Area 61)  
 
The gazami crab (Plate 1) is the largest crab 
fishery in the PICES Region (Table 3) and is the 
largest single-species crab fishery in the world.  It 
is frequently referred to as “blue crab”, but we use 
the FAO common name here to avoid confusion 
with a similarly named, heavily exploited species 
(Callinectes sapidus) from eastern North America.  
Portunid crabs in general are also occasionally 
referred to as blue crabs, although the term 
swimming crabs is much preferred.  The gazami 
crab is found in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and 
the East China Sea, as well as in certain Japanese 
waters within the PICES Region, but is also 
harvested in areas south of 24°N.  Due to this 
southerly distribution, landings for China may 
include areas outside the PICES Region.  This is 
the only crab of any great commercial importance 
in the Chinese portion of the PICES Region.  
Significant fisheries for this species are also 
prosecuted in Japan and South Korea (Table 4), 
and it is probably harvested in North Korea as 
well.  While there are multinational fisheries for 
gazami crab in the Yellow and East China Seas, 
most fishing is in inshore waters and there is no 
international management of the resource.  In 
Japan, considerable fishing takes place in the 
Inland Sea (Shiota 1993, Ariyama 1993) but 
gazami landing statistics are not well distinguished 
from that of other swimming crabs and the fishery 
is small relative to that in China or South Korea.  
Most crab fisheries in the PICES Region use pots 
and only exploit large males.  By contrast, gazami 
crabs are usually fished with trawls or other types 
of nets over most of their range, and both males 
and females are harvested. 
 
3.1.1 China 
 
The gazami crab and several other portunid crabs 
are intensively cultured in some areas of China, 
including parts of the East China Sea coast, where 
separation of aquacultural production from wild 
harvests in landing statistics may not be complete.  
There are intensive Chinese fisheries for wild 
stocks of gazami crab in the Yellow and Bohai 
Seas (Table 5), where aquaculture is absent.  
9
 
During the last decade, catches of gazami crab in 
China have increased year after year, and so far 
are being sustained.  Based on landings from 
Zhejiang Province, China, yearly catches 
increased from 10-15 to 20-25 thousand tons 
between 1972-1977 and 1978-1982, respectively, 
due to increased fishing effort.  For example, a 
landing in 1978 of 6,800 t was achieved by 300 
fishing vessels of Wenzhou (one of the districts of 
Zhejiang Province), while 2,000 vessels realized a 
catch of 10,400 t in 1982.  Other factors confirmed 
this catch–per-unit-effort (CPUE) decline.  To 
sustain abundance, conservation measures need to 
be taken, appropriate to the gazami crab’s biology.  
It was suggested that protecting spawners in the 
spring, young crab habitat in the summer, and 
conducting reasonable fishing in winter be 
considered (Zhaung and Deng 1999). 
 
According to catch analyses (Zhaung and Deng 
1999) in China from 1922-1981, individual body 
weight ranged from 15-650 g, with 70% ranging 
from 140-340 g.  Carapace width (CW) ranged 
from 30-250 mm, and were dominated by 120-190 
mm CW crab.  During June to November, size 
composition fluctuates greatly due to rapid 
individual crab growth and intermittent 
recruitment to the fished population. 
 
The spawning season extends from March to 
April.  Females migrate to the spawning grounds 
prior to the males, and female crabs may make up 
70% of the catch during this time.  During July to 
November, male crabs typically exceed the 
number of females in the catch. 
 
The mating period in China is from July to 
November, with peak activity from September to 
October.  Mating occurs when the female is 
molting.  Mated females store sperm and reach 
sexual maturity in the spring when extrusion, 
fertilization and the start of incubation occur.  
From February to July, egg-incubating females are 
found in the catch.  Two broods may be incubated 
each year.  A second incubation, when present, 
normally occurs 10-20 days after the first one is 
hatched.  Fecundity is a function of body weight:    
 
R
1
 = -34.1 + 3.86 W
1 
 
R
2
 = -41.4 + 5.41 W
2
 
where, R
1
 and R
2
 are incubated egg numbers (10
3
) 
in the first and second incubations, respectively;  
and W
1
 and W
2
 are corresponding body weights 
(g).  A 100 g female thus produces about 350,000 
eggs at first mating, while a 150 g female would 
produce about 770,000 eggs.  The relationship 
between body weight (W) and carapace length 
(CL) is: 
 
 W = 0.000396 CL
3.06888
  
 
Larvae are planktonic and have 6 larval stages.  
Incubation and larval development occur over 20-
30 days.  
 
Gazami crab may hibernate during the one-three 
winters of their life span.  Age is estimated from 
size-frequency distributions, and growth is 
described with the von Bertalanffy model with the 
following parameters:  L = 68.0 mm CL, K = 
0.777 (month), t
0 
= 0.558 (month), and W = 167.2 
(g).  Growth is fastest in the summer months and 
because there may be inflections in the growth 
curve, the above model is only approximate.  
Feeding is a nocturnal activity that occurs 
throughout the year.  Principal prey items include 
benthic organisms and small fishes, but carrion, 
shrimps, squids and marine plants are also eaten.     
 
3.1.2 South Korea 
 
Almost all landings for swimming crabs in South 
Korea (Table 4) are gazami crab and these data are 
an accurate portrayal of trends in this fishery.  The 
South Korean fishery was small and little known 
prior to 1970, but exceeded 10,000 t in 1974, 
20,000 t 1981 and peaked at 32,000 t in 1988 due 
to increased fishing effort and the extension of 
fishing grounds as increased fishing developed.  
Thereafter, landings declined and were 10,400 t in 
1998.  Individual crab size was mainly 90-170 mm 
CW between 1988 to 1993 (Yeon 1997).  The 
South Korean fishery depends on two groups of 
crabs that differ in their migrations and biological 
parameters (Kim et al. 1986, Yeon et al. 1992, 
Yeon et al. 1998, Yeon 1999).  The two 
populations are the Korean western coast and East 
China Sea groups.  The Korean western coast 
group occurs in the middle of the Yellow Sea 
during the winter and migrates to South Korean 
western coastal areas to spawn during late March-
August.  After spawning, it moves back to its 
10
 
wintering area around September, and crabs may 
hibernate by burying in the seafloor.   
 
The East China Sea group spends winter in the 
southwestern area of Cheju Island where a branch 
of the Kuroshio Warm Current flows.  These crab 
migrate to southern South Korean coastal areas to 
spawn, where they are present from March-
August.  After spawning, they move back to their 
wintering grounds, where they stay from 
September-November (Yeon 1997).

Fluctuations in landings of crabs from the Korean 
western coast group and the East China Sea group 
are similar.  However, the regression slope 
decrease in landings from the East China Sea 
group was steeper than that of the Korean western 
coast group.  Landings of the Korean western 
coast group were 18,000 t in the late 1980s and 
10,000 t in 1998, but those for the East China Sea 
group were 14,000 t in the late 1980s and 3,000 in 
1998 (Table 6).  Fishing for these groups occurs 
during both the inshore (March-June) and offshore 
migrations (September-November). 
  
The Korean western coast group spawns from 
May-August at a mean size of 126 mm CW.  In 
the East China Sea group, the mean size at 
spawning is 103 mm CW.  Mating takes place 
between June and November, with a peak activity 
from August to October.  The size of male crabs at 
50% maturity was estimated to be 100 mm CW.  
Individual female fecundity at first spawning 
ranges from 211,000 at 80 mm CW to 5,359,000 
eggs at 170 mm, and increased exponentially with 
an increase in carapace width (Yeon 1999): 
 
Fc = 854.673CW

The relationship between carapace length (CW) 
and body weight (W) is:  
 
W = 0.158CW
2.877 
 
A change in this relationship occurs between May-
October for females and between March-October 
for males.  Growth in CW, notch-to-notch shows a 
seasonal pattern.  Estimated seasonal growth 
equations were: 
 
Female:  CW
t
=18.7(1-e
-{0.668(t+0.730)+(0.912/2π)sin2π(t-0.208)}

=16.9(1-e
-{0.940(t+0.503)+(1.603/2π)sin2π(t-0.168)}
)  
 
Growth of crabs was comparatively faster from 
August-October.  Crabs grew little in the winter 
between January-March, i.e., about eight months 
after hatching (Yeon et al. 1998). 
 
To manage this crab, various approaches have 
been utilised:  reducing the number of fishing 
vessels, prohibition of fishing on the spawning 
grounds during the main spawning season (July to 
August), and improved monitoring of vessels in 
coastal area waters.  In addition, larvae hatched in 
culture have been released and a legal size limit of 
60 mm carapace length (CL), or 110 mm notch-to-
notch CW exists.  
 
In contrast to crabs from more northerly waters, 
gazami crab have a relatively short generation 
time, high fecundity, multiple broods and high 
growth rates, which means their population 
abundance and size composition can both change 
rapidly.  Crabs hatched in the spring grow to 
commercial size by autumn, and can spawn the 
next spring.  
 
3.2  Snow crabs (Chionoecetes spp, Majidae, 
FAO:  PCR, Areas 61, 67) 
 
Within the genus Chionoecetes, landings of snow 
crab (Chionoecetes opilio, Plate 1) have been 
historically most important, followed by Tanner 
crab (Chionoecetes bairdi, Plate 1) and most 
recently, fisheries for the red snow crab, or 
benizuwai gani (Chionoecetes japonicus, Plate 1) 
in the Japan/East Sea (Fig. 5).  The EBS snow crab 
fisheries have been particularly significant over 
the past 15 years and have caused the large 
fluctuations in landings (Fig. 6, Table 8).  The 
other two species, grooved Tanner crab 
(Chionoecetes tanneri) and angled Tanner crab 
(Chionoecetes angulatus), are deepwater species 
that resemble benizuwai gani.  There have been 
exploratory efforts and only limited harvest of 
these two minor species in North America 
(Jamieson 1990, Jamieson et al. 1990, Philips and 
12
 
Lauzier 1997, Boutillier et al. 1998).  For the years 
1997-1999 inclusive, Russian landings of angled 
Tanner crab amounted to 2,400 t and came mostly 
from the Sea of Okhotsk.  Russian landings of 
grooved Tanner crab were 300 t, mostly from the 
Western Bering Sea during the same period.  
 
Chionoecetes spp. are brachyurans and are capable 
of storing spermatophores from one mating to 
fertilise eggs at subsequent egg extrusions.  Like 
the gazami crab or the hair crab (see below), snow 
crabs normally extrude and fertilise eggs shortly 
after the time of mating, but unlike the former 
crabs, they are also capable of fertilizing eggs in a 
subsequent annual egg extrusion period from 
stored spermataphores if no males are available to 
mate with and renew their carried spermatophores.  
It is generally agreed that female magid crabs go 
through a terminal molt when they assume their 
adult morphology.  There is still controversy as to 
whether the male molt to morphometric maturity 
is always a final or terminal molt.  Otto (1998) 
reviewed some of the consequences of this life 
history pattern relative to Chionoecetes fisheries in 
the EBS.  
 
3.2.1 Snow and red snow crabs 
 
Pacific snow crab have a broad distribution across 
several zoogeographic provinces, which provides 
comparative research opportunities similar to 
those for king crabs.  Snow crab range in the 
Pacific from the Amundsen Gulf in the south-
eastern Beaufort Sea (but not eastward in the 
Canadian arctic (Squires 1968)) to the Japan/East 
Sea.  Snow crab are not found south of the Alaska 
Peninsula in North American Pacific waters.  
Snow crab occur to depths of about 700 m in 
Pacific North America but may be found even 
deeper in the Japan/East Sea.  Snow crab also 
occur in the north-west Atlantic, where many 
detailed studies of their general biology have been 
carried out. 
 
Fisheries for the snow crab have a long history in 
Japan but Japanese landings from Asian waters 
were relatively low prior to 1940.  The recent 
history of the fishery is given in Figure 7.  In the 
Japan/East Sea, there was a long fishery 
development period that continued until the early 
1960s followed by a period of fluctuating 
landings, and then a slow decline in abundance 
that continues to the present.  Landings in 
Hokkaido also came largely from the Japan/East 
Sea, and have followed the same declining trend, 
after developing rapidly in the late 1960s.  
 
South Korean landings of snow crab 
(Chionoecetes opilio) are few, totalling less than 
500 t annually.  Most of the landed crabs are 
caught at 200-400 m depth by bottom gill nets 
from December through May.  To enhance the 
stock, management tactics used are:  a limit on 
mesh size (180 mm), a closed fishing season 
(June-October) and a prohibition on fishing all 
females, and small male crabs less than 90 mm 
CL.

SNOW (C. OPILIO) TANNER (C. BAIRDI) RED (C. JAPONICUS)
 
Fig. 5  Composition by species of North Pacific catches (10
3
 t), 1952-2000, of snow or tanner crabs.  
Chionoecetes opilio = snow crab which are amphi-Pacific;  tanner crab = C. bairdi which are North 
American;  and red snow crab or benizuwai gani, = C. japonicus which are mostly from the Sea of Japan.  
Very small experimental or exploratory fisheries for two other deepwater species (C. tanneri, C. 
angulatus) are ignored.  Landings in Russian waters by foreign fleets are not included prior to 1986.  
 
Japan had extensive distant water crab fleets that 
used to fish in what are now U.S. and Russian 200 
nautical mile exclusive zones.  The complete 
history of landings from Russian waters was not 
available, which accounts for the shortness of the 
Russian data series in Fig. 6, but the combined 
U.S. and Japanese fisheries in the EBS were well 
documented through statistical series and research 
conducted under the auspices of the International 
North Pacific Fisheries Commission.  In the EBS, 
there have been three periods of high snow crab 
abundance (Fig. 6), the first of which may not 
have been completely captured by the developing 
fisheries in the 1970s.  Fluctuations since 1975 
have been extensive. 
 
3.2.2 Tanner crab 
 
Tanner crab are found from the Japan/East Sea 
(Kon 1996) around the North Pacific Rim to 
Oregon (Hosie and Gaumer 1974).  In areas of the 
Bering Sea north of the Pribilof Islands, Tanner 
crab are generally restricted to the outer 
continental shelf and slope where waters are 
warmed by upwellings and the Bering shelf 
current (Stabeno et al. 1999).  In more southerly 
areas, they may occur from the intertidal to depths 
of about 700 m.  
 
Fisheries for the Tanner crab are mostly in North 
American waters (Fig. 8) and it is probable that 
most catches in Asia are taken incidentally in the 
pursuit of other species.  Tanner crab fisheries in 
the GOA were developed as king crab fisheries 
declined in the late 1960s.  Tanner crab had long 
been taken as bycatch in king crab fisheries and 
the switch involved little by way of modifying 
vessels and gear.  Following fishery development, 
GOA Tanner crab fisheries experienced a decade 
of moderately fluctuating landings, followed by a 
long period of gradual decline until most fisheries 
were closed in the late 1990s (Fig. 8).  However, 
in the EBS the fishery pattern was quite different, 
and there were three periods of peak abundance 
that seemed to be unrelated to abundance patterns 
in the GOA.  The first period of abundance may 
not have been entirely reflected by the developing 
Japanese distant water Tanner crab fishery, 
displaced from the EBS king crab fishery by the 
U.S. crab fleet.  The second peak was fished by 
14
 
both Japanese and U.S. fishermen, while the third 
was solely a U.S. fishery.  Tanner crab landed by 
both nations were generally larger than 1.0 kg I, 
while snow crab were about 0.5 kg, which 
explains, in part, why the EBS Tanner crab fishery 
developed before the snow crab fishery, even 
though snow crab are most numerous.  Rosenkranz 
et al. (1998) explained some of the fluctuations in 
Tanner crab recruitment through wind direction 
and velocity, and their probable influence on larval 
drift patterns.  Peaks in snow and Tanner crab 
abundance coincided in the late 1970s and early 
1990s but not in the late 1990s (Figs. 6 and 8).

KODIAK EAST BERING SEA OTHER ALASKA JAPAN
 
Fig. 8  Historical landings (10
3
 t) in selected Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) fisheries, 1965-2000.  
Their three apparent peaks in abundance of the Eastern Bering Sea stock are different than the pattern 
observed in the Gulf of Alaska (Other Alaska).  The Bering Sea stock peaked first under exploitation by 
Japanese distant water mothership fleets, secondly when jointly exploited by the United States and Japan, 
and thirdly during only American exploitation.  The last two peaks in Bering Sea Tanner crab abundance 
coincided with the first two peaks in snow crab abundance.  The Gulf of Alaska fishery had a period of 
rapid expansion in the early 1970s following the decline of the king crab fishery, followed by a period of 
fluctuating abundance until the early 1980s and a gradual decline thereafter. 
 
The red snow crab is fished in Japanese, South 
Korean, Russian and possibly North Korean 
waters (Fig. 9).  South Korean fishing for the crab 
has developed since the late 1980s.  South Korean 
fishing had increased to 39,000 t in 1997, but 
decreased to 33,000 t in 1998.  Most landings from 
the Japan/East Sea are caught by baited crab traps 
at 700-1,500 m depth, as in the Japanese fishery.  
Catches are dominated by crabs of 75-105 mm CL 
(Gong et al. 1978).  In order to promote a 
sustainable yield, landings of females and the use 
of trap mesh less than 150 mm are prohibited by 
law.  
 
In Japan, landings of females and male crabs less 
than 90 mm CW are prohibited by law.  The main 
Japanese fishing area is at a depth of 1,000–2,000 
m.  In the mid-1980's, landings of this crab 
reached 50,000 t, but have since decreased.  The 
recent landing of 69,300 t from the Japan/East Sea 
for both countries combined are at a peak, making 
this fishery the world’s largest for a deepwater 
(>500 m) crab species.  Fluctuations in landings 
until recently were from the development of new 
grounds in the Japan/East Sea, It now appears that 
all grounds may be developed and that 
overexploitation may be occurring. 
 
Tanner and snow crabs spatial distributions are 
less patchy and form fewer apparent stocks than 
do king crabs.  Females of both species tend to be 
more densely concentrated than males.  Near 
Kodiak, recent studies of Tanner crab reproduction 
have shown different spawning behaviours 
between primiparous and multiparous females 
(Stevens et al. 1993;  Stevens et al. 1994, 1999;  
Stevens et al. 1996).  Primiparous females spawn 
singly while multiparous females form dense 
aggregations of mounded females, that apparently 
facilitates larval release.  Mounding of females 
seems to be timed to release larvae during the 
highest spring tides of the year, as this behaviour 
has not been found at other times of the year.  
Spawning aggregations of other species of 
Chionoecetes are undocumented, but survey data 
in the EBS suggest that significant aggregations of 
female snow crab occurs.  The positioning of such 
aggregations relative to prevailing current or wind 
transport may be important in determining 
recruitment patterns.

gani (Chionoecetes japonicus), 1960-2000.  The traditional fishery off Honshu reached a pear in the early 
1980s and declined through the early 1990s.  The sharp peak in production is due to the rapid 
development of South Korean fisheries in the western basin of the Japan/East Sea. 
 
3.3  Dungeness crab (Cancer magister, 
Cancridae, FAO:  DUN, Areas 67, 77) 
 
Dungeness crab (Plate 1) are commercially 
exploited from central California to Unalaska 
Island in the eastern Aleutian Islands by the 
United States and Canada (Table 8, Fig. 10).  Only 
hard-shell males about 4+ years old (> 165 mm 
CW spine-to-spine;  155 mm CW notch-to-notch) 
are legal in the commercial pot fishery.  Most 
exploitation in the US occurs from winter through 
spring, while in Canada, its during the spring and 
summer. Populations regularly cycle in abundance 
south of British Columbia, with peaks and troughs 
every 8-10 years (Table 9, Fig. 11).  The central 
California stock declined in the late 1950s in 
accord with the entire U.S Dungeness fishery, but 
did not rebuild and has apparently collapsed.  
 
Eastern Pacific landings from 1970-1996 ranged 
from a minimum 5,000 t (1974) to a maximum of 
26,000 t (1977). For a complete summary of 
annual landings across eastern Pacific fishing 
areas, see the Pacific States Marine Fisheries 
Commission website, www.psmfc.org for tables 
and figures on crab, as well as pandalid shrimp.  
British Columbia landings are smaller, have been 
more consistent from year to year, and do not 
display the cyclic patterns observed in the 
California to Washington fisheries.  However, 
major differences in recruitment patterns have 
been observed in British Columbian waters (Fig. 
12), with the most recent being a major 
recruitment of Dungeness crab in the waters 
around the Queen Charlotte Islands.  Alaskan 
landings are not in synchrony with either the 
southern U.S. states or with Canada, and landings 
there may have been market driven over portions 
of the historical landing series.  In several regions 
of Alaska, there have been historic fish-downs of 
Dungeness crab stocks that may indicate both 
inherently slower growth and a more episodic 
recruitment.  Orensanz et al. (1998) described the 
virtual collapse of Dungeness crab and other 
decapod fisheries in Prince William Sound in 
advance of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, and 
elsewhere more broadly across the south-east Gulf 
of Alaska.  Since patterns of abundance differ 
between zoogeographic provinces, comparative 
studies within populations of this species may 
provide insight into mechanisms influencing crab 
population sizes.

Hypothesised environmental and ecological effects 
that have been evaluated in efforts to explain the 
cyclical pattern of abundance of California-
Washington Dungeness crab include elevated 
temperatures (Wild et al. 1983), nemertean worm 
predation on incubating eggs (Wickham 1979), 
salmon predation on larvae (Thomas 1985), and 
various cyclic phenomena (cannibalism, 
upwelling, wind stress, geostrophic flow, fishing 
effort;  see reviews by Botsford et al. 1989, 
Jamieson et al. 1989, McConnaughey et al. 1994, 
Orensanz et al. 1998).  Habitat and fishing impacts 
that effect stocks include dredging to maintain 
navigation channels and for landfills (Wainwright 
et al. 1992), use of pesticides in estuaries to 
benefit oyster culture (Feldman et al. 2000), and 
ghost pot fishing and fishery handling of sublegal 
males and females (Smith and Jamieson 1989).  
Current fishery regulations select for the largest 
males, and it has been hypothesised that 
regulations could be selecting genetically for 
smaller males, since it is these males that end up 
doing most of the mating in fully-exploited 
populations (Fig. 13, Jamieson et al. 1998).  The 
relative absence of large males may in turn 
decrease the mating opportunities for larger 
females, which might negatively influence the 
probability of their moulting and so their 
population size structure as well.

Foreign species introductions have had actual or 
perceived negative impacts on local Dungeness 
populations.  The European green crab, Carcinus 
maenus, is considered a potential competitor and 
juvenile crab predator of Dungeness crab 
(Jamieson et al. 1998), although evidence to the 
contrary indicates cancrid populations may 
substantially restrict Carcinus in the eastern 
Pacific (McDonald et al. 2001).  The exotic cord 
grass, Spartina alterniflora, encroaches across 
estuarine tideflats and may reduce available 
habitat for small juvenile crab that otherwise use 
20
 
eelgrass (Zostera marina) and shell (see Fernandez 
et al. 1993, McMillan et al. 1995).  However, one 
potentially beneficial consequence of an exotic 
introduction is that of the eastern soft-shell clam, 
Mya arenaria, to estuaries of the eastern Pacific in 
the late 19
th
 century.  Shell deposits of adult clams 
accumulate and provide excellent refuges for small 
instars of Dungeness (Palacios et al. 2000), which 
has been used as a basis of intertidal habitat 
mitigation programs in which oyster shell 
(Crassostrea gigas) is spread over large tideflats 
to promote crab survival (Dumbauld et al. 1993, 
2000).

frequency distributions (mm, notch-to-notch CW) 
by A.  instar and B.  age for male Dungeness crab.  
(Note:  instar absolute abundances are arbitrary, 
and increments in age refer to moults, which may 
not always be on an annual basis) Ages y+3 and 
y+4 (the latter assumed to be 50% of y+3) are 
summed to give a size frequency distribution for 
instar x+3, with attenuation of abundance at size 
above the legal size of 155 mm CW (the vertical 
bar) because of fishing.  Most prerecruit instar x+3 
crabs appear to have a 2-tear intermoult period, at 
least when the population is fished, and relatively 
few (here shown as 10% of age y+4) crabs appear 
to survive to age y+5 (instar x+4). 
The list of factors evaluated to explain changes in 
Dungeness crab populations is a sampling of 
factors that are thought to control crab populations 
in general.  Predation on adult crab, parasitism and 
epizootic diseases are all known to be important 
factors population abundance determination in a 
number of king and Tanner crab populations.  
 
Even through thoroughly studied, there has been 
no general agreement as to the mechanisms 
responsible for the cyclic trends in Dungeness crab 
abundance observed from northern California 
through Washington.  Larval sampling has shown 
that megalopae offshore from the coasts of 
California, Oregon and Washington are dispersed 
long-shore and off-shore by wind driven currents.  
These currents reverse seasonally before eventual 
shoreward transport, but the nature and degree of 
wind-current dispersal of larvae relative to nursery 
habitat is still being debated (see hypotheses 
proposed by Botsford 1986, Johnson et al. 1986, 
McConnaughey et al. 1992, Wing et al. 1998).  
Such mechanisms do not predetermine settlement 
location.  Off Vancouver Island, megalopae appear 
to be concentrated in boundary areas between near 
shore surface currents moving in opposing 
directions, and this may impede their necessary 
movement to shallow water (Jamieson et al. 
1989), where survival after settlement is 
maximised.  The preference of outer coast 
megalopae to the upper 25 m of the water column 
is a behaviour that apparently fosters beneficial 
transport.  By contrast, larvae from Dungeness 
crab populations within the Strait of Georgia occur 
in an estuarine circulation pattern, where surface 
water (<100 m) flows outward through the Strait 
of Juan de Fuca and is replaced by an influx of 
saltier water at depth.  Strait of Georgia larvae 
make daily vertical migrations (surface at night, at 
depth during daylight) of about 160 m, and with 
the long day length, are thereby effectively 
retained within the Strait of Georgia 
oceanographic system.  Outer coast megalopae 
cannot easily enter the Strait because they 
continuously reside in the out-flowing surface 
waters.  This is an example of very different larval 
behaviours resulting in transport favorable for 
each population, despite the close geographic 
proximity of the two populations (Jamieson and 
Phillips 1993).  Hypothetically, such behaviours 
probably evolved relatively rapidly, perhaps 
21
 
within a few thousand years at most, as the Strait 
of Georgia did not exist about 10,000 years ago, as 
it was glaciated.   It therefore seems quite 
plausible that different crab and/or shrimp 
populations of other species may also have 
population-specific behaviours that help spatially 
structured adult populations persist.  Care must 
therefore be taken in suggesting common dispersal 
patterns for species as a whole and for even 
specific populations, unless dispersal patterns from 
those populations have been directly studied.  
 
3.4  Other crabs 
 
Hair Crab (Erimacrus Isenbeckii), Rock Crabs 
(Cancer productus, Cancer anthonyii), and 
sheep crab (Loxorynchus grandus) provide 
small fisheries in the PICES Region, but except 
for hair crab, these fisheries are poorly 
documented.  Hair crab are of considerable 
importance in Hokkaido (see Fig. 25) and 
sometimes are landed in the EBS (Fig. 14).  In 
the EBS, most landings occur near the Pribilof 
Islands, although the species has a 
widerdistribution (www.AFSC.NOAA.GOV/ 
Kodiak)
The biology of the species in the Bering Sea has 
been summarized by Armetta and Stevens 
(1986) and several publications by Abe 
(1973,1977,1982 and 1992) provide much 
information for Japanese waters.  Factors 
affecting recruitment in this species have not 
been investigated. 
 
3.5  King crabs (Lithodes and Paralithodes 
spp., Lithodidae, FAO:  KCS, Areas 61, 67) 
 
Landings of king crabs (Plate 2) in the PICES 
Region have ranged from 38,400 t (1984) to 
61,900 t (1995) over the past 15 years of record 
(Table 10), and landings have been much more 
stable in Asian than in North American waters.  
Landing data (Table 10) show the recent history of 
this fishery by FAO Areas and nation.  In 
actuality, these figures belie the economic 
importance of king crabs, which are generally sold 
at the highest prices of any crabs in the PICES 
Region.  Due to their economic importance and 
significance in international trade, king crab 
fisheries have been a key negotiating point in the 
development of international fisheries 
arrangements throughout northerly portions of the 
PICES Region.

22
 
Red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus, Plate 
2) fisheries of the Sea of Okhotsk and the eastern 
Bering Sea (EBS) have been most important, 
followed by blue king crab (Paralithodes platypus, 
Plate 2) in the Sea of Okhotsk, off the Koryak 
Coast, and in the EBS.  Golden king crab 
(Lithodes aequispina, Plate 2) in the Aleutian 
Islands and the Sea of Okhotsk are next in 
importance.  The Hanasaki gani, or brown king 
crab (Paralithodes brevipes, Plate 2), is a shallow 
water (< 100 m) species that is confined to Asiatic 
waters, and is particularly important in Japan.  
Hanasaki gani are smaller crab than the other three 
king crab species listed above and rarely exceed 
2.5 kg in weight.  Fisheries for the scarlet king 
crab (Lithodes couesi) have been largely 
experimental;  this crab occurs at depths usually 
exceeding 700 m. 
 
Four species of king crabs thus support major 
fisheries in the PICES Region.  They differ in their 
life history characteristics and because many 
species’ populations co-occur, comparative study 
of the effects of life history characteristics on 
population stability may be possible.  For 
example, red king crab and blue king crab both 
inhabit the Pribilof Islands area and some areas of 
the Sea of Okhotsk, where their comparative 
dynamics may be explored.  
 
3.5.1 Blue king crab 
 
Blue king crab are similar to red king crab, but 
usually are biennial spawners with lesser fecundity 
and somewhat larger sized (ca. 1.2 mm) eggs 
(Somerton and Macintosh 1983, Jensen and 
Armstrong 1989, Selin and Fedotov 1996).  By 
comparison, the more common red king crab are 
annual spawners with relatively higher fecundity 
and smaller sized (ca. 1.0 mm) eggs.  Ecologically 
the two species apparently are very similar.  The 
lower reproductive potential of blue king crab is 
interesting from an oceanographic perspective 
(Fig. 15), since blue king crab populations form 
concentrations around offshore islands in the EBS 
(Fig. 16).  Presumably, either localized transport 
mechanisms or demersal larval behavior might be 
involved in maintaining these populations of blue 
king crab.  Oceanographic data from these near-
shore, island areas has been insufficiently 
described and larval surveys, mostly for relative 
abundance within a specific survey design, have 
been sporadic.

Little stock specific assessment information is 
available for most Asian stocks, which tend to be 
located near continental coasts rather than islands.  
North American stocks are surveyed annually and 
managed in a manner similar to the EBS red king 
crab (see below). 
 
In general, blue king crab stocks are small and 
localized (Fig. 16) and support small fisheries.  
For example, combined landings from the Pribilof 
and St. Matthew Island areas have seldom 
exceeded 5,000 t (Fig. 17).  The Pribilof Islands 
stock has been fished since 1966 when Japanese 
fishermen began exploratory efforts.  The fishery 
produced an average of 1,300 t during the 1960s, 
which rose to 1,850 t in the 1970s.  The Pribilof 
fishery reached a peak of 4,980 t in 1980, but soon 
declined precipitously to 120 t in 1986.  The 
fishery was closed by the State of Alaska in 1988 
and only four fishing seasons have been allowed 
since.  The fishery has averaged 370 t during the 
four fishing seasons allowed during the 1990s.  
Pribilof Islands blue king crab are among the 
largest in the world and the average size of landed 
crab has exceeded 3.5 kg in many years.  Blue 
king crab in the St. Matthew Island area are 
smaller and fishery average weight seldom 
exceeds 2.2 kg.  The St. Matthew fishery is 
smaller and began in 1977.  For the years 1977-
1999, the fishery averaged 1,350 t;  it has ranged 
from 90 t in 1979 to 4,290 t in 1983.  The fishery 
declined severely after 1998, following the near 
average catch of 1,300 t in 1998, the 1999 survey 
indicated an 80-90 % decrease in abundance, that 
lead to closure of this fishery (see http:  
//www.afsc.noaa.gov/kodiak/) for details 
concerning EBS stocks. 
 
Other stocks of blue king crab occur in scattered 
locations in the GOA and the EBS, but they are 
much smaller, rarely fished and have mostly been 
unsurveyed.  Their scattered locations and 
frequent occurrence in fjord-like waters poses 
interesting zoogeographic and ecological 
questions. 
 
Russian stocks in the Western Bering Sea (WBS), 
particularly along the Koryak coast, have yielded 
an average 1,800 t in recent (1996-1999) years.  
However, the Sea of Okhotsk, where several 
stocks occur, is more important.  Sea of Okhotsk 
landings averaged 3,720 t between 1986-1999 and 
peaked at 7,580 t in 1997.  Over the past 5 years, 
the Sea of Okhotsk produced 29% of Russian 
landings.  Total landings from Russian waters 
have averaged 7,200 t in recent years.  The higher 
and steadier production of blue king crab in the 
WBS and Sea of Okhotsk may reflect more 
constant and colder conditions caused by a 
southerly current and proximity to a large 
continental land mass to the west. 
 
3.5.2 Golden king crab 
 
Golden, or brown, king crab occur from the 
Japan/East Sea to the northern Bering Sea, around 
the Aleutian Islands, on various sea mounts, and as 
far south as northern British Columbia.  They are 
typically found on the continental slope at depths 
of 300-900 m.  Their fisheries are relatively recent 
developments in most areas and frequently have 
developed (e.g., Figs. 18, 19) after shallower-
water king crab fisheries became fully developed 
or had declined (Somerton and Otto 1986, 
Orensanz et al. 1998).  Golden king crab have 
much larger eggs (ca. 2.3 mm) than those of blue 
or red king crabs (Otto and Cummiskey 1985, 
Somerton and Otto 1986) and also tend to spawn 
throughout the year rather than in the late winter 
and spring (Hiramoto 1985, Hiramoto and Sato 
1970, Otto and Cummiskey 1985, Klitin et al. 
1999, Somerton and Otto 1986).  Golden king crab 
eggs have about 12 times the volume of red king 
26
 
crab eggs.  Large eggs tend to be characteristic of 
the genus Lithodes, and scarlet king crab also have 
relatively large eggs.  A seasonal spawning occurs 
because larvae in this species are capable of 
lecithotrophic development (Shirley and Zhou 
1997).  There are few records of golden king crab 
larvae in upper water plankton tows and it is 
possible that these larvae are demersal.  In 
southeastern Alaska and British Columbia, 
isolated golden king crab populations are 
frequently found in deep-water fjords or other long 
narrow sounds (Jewett et al. 1985).  Populations in 
some of these confined areas seem to show an 
elevated incidence of parasitism (Sloan 1984, 
Sloan et al. 1984).  In many areas of the GOA and 
northern British Columbian coastal waters, 
populations of golden king crab may spend their 
entire life span in such bays or fjords.  
 
The most important golden king crab fisheries are 
found in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Aleutian 
Islands (Fig. 20).  These fisheries tend to be recent 
in origin (since 1980).  From 1986 to 1999, golden 
king crab fisheries in the Russian Far East 
produced an average landing of 2,500 t.  From 
1994–1999, annual landings have been more than 
twice those of previous years but have been 
declining.  In the Aleutian Islands, golden king 
crab were taken incidentally to red king crab until 
1981, when a directed fishery was first 
established.  Landings from 1975 to 1979 
averaged 10 t per year, while those from 1981 to 
1999 averaged 3,600 t, with a peak landings of 
6,650 t in 1986. 
 
3.5.3 Red king crab 
 
Red king crab are economically the most 
important of the king crabs.  Commercial fisheries 
for them were pioneered by the Japanese in the 
early 1900s and fishing for this species soon 
developed into a major commercial enterprise.  
Cahn (1948) reviewed the development of the 
Japanese fishery.  The economic importance of red 
king crab coupled with an ongoing interest in 
marine biology displayed by the Japanese royal 
family lead to a number of classic crab studies, 
such as that of Marukawa (1933), and later to 
interest in Alaskan resources. 
 
Red king crab canned production data were 
converted to number of crab landed using data 
from Cahn (1948) to show trends in the Japanese 
pre–1940 fishery for various areas (Fig. 21).  The 
earliest developments were in Hokkaido, Karafuto 
(modern day Sakhalin Island), and the southern 
Kuril Islands.  These fisheries lead to shore-based 
processing in the Northern Kuril Islands and major 
fisheries in western Kamchatka, which is today the 
world’s most important red king crab fishery.  Use 
of floating processors (“floaters” in Fig. 21) lead 
to further developments, including exploratory 
fishing in the EBS and the Koryak Coast during 
the 1930s.  Most of the “floaters” (Fig. 21) and 
their catcher boat fleets, however, exploited waters 
of the Sea of Okhotsk, and their landings generally 
reflected abundance in that region.

landings by species in the greater GOA (Orensanz 
et al. 1998). 
All major Asian stocks were apparently fully 
exploited by 1930.  The Hokkaido fishery enjoyed 
a long period of stability, showing only one major 
peak (1933) and decline in the pre-war era.  Stocks 
in the Japan/East Sea (principally near Sakhalin 
Island) showed several peaks  (1917, 1930) and 
more variability than those around Hokkaido.  The 
West Kamtchatka fishery peaked in 1927 and 
again about 1940, before fisheries were curtailed 
during the war years.

Fig. 22 Historical landings of red king crab in major fisheries since 1945. 
 
After 1945, (Fig. 22), all of these fisheries were 
reestablished except for those in the Japan/East 
Sea.  The Hokkaido fishery resumed at a similar 
level, if an average landed weight of about 2.5 kg 
is assumed (note change of scale between Figs. 21 
and 22).  
 
The West Kamchatcan fishery was prosecuted 
both by Japan and the Soviet Union, leading to 
record catches and a period of stability from 1955-
1965.  This lead to a decade-long gradual decline 
in landings.  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the 
Japanese in Bristol bay and the Americans in the 
Gulf of Alaska developed Alaskan king crab 
fisheries as far west as the Adak area of the 
Aleutian Islands.  Trends in the Gulf of Alaska 
fishery are represented in Figure 22 by Kodiak 
landings, but it should be noted there were 
simultaneous fisheries developed in Cook Inlet, 
along the southern Alaska Peninsula, and in the 
eastern Aleutians (Fig. 23).  The EBS red king 
crab fishery (Fig. 24) first began in the 1930s 
when Japanese fishermen began to exploit this 
stock with tangle nets (Cahn 1948).  There was 
some U.S. trawl fishing during the 1940s, but 
effort and catch were small.  During this time, the 
needs of the developing U.S. king crab industry 
were largely met in the GOA, and this continued 
until the late 1960s.  Japanese fishing began again 
in 1953 (Nyahara 1954), when the modern fishery 
began.  Otto (1981) reviewed the history of the 
multinational king and Tanner crab fisheries in the 
EBS from 1953 to 1979.  Except for minor 
exploratory efforts by Japanese and Russian fleets 
in the 1960s, fishing in the GOA and Aleutian 
Islands has always been entirely an U.S. industry.  
A special study of red king crab in Alaska was 
conducted in 1940-1941, and this was both 
instrumental in stimulating fishery development 
and provided initial detailed biological 
information (Wallace et al. 1949, Harrison et al. 
1942). 
 
The mid 1960s was a period if high red king crab 
landings in Asia as well as North America, but 
there were signs that stock exploitations were at or 
approaching their limits.  For example, Bristol Bay 
data in the Bering Sea showed that CPUE peaked 
in 1960 and that increased catch was being 
maintained by increases in the number of tangle 
nets being fished and in the average time that nets 
were soaked.  Following peak catches in 1964, the 
Bristol Bay stock began to decline.  The Kodiak 
and other GOA stocks also declined sharply, and 
this lead to both more stringent management 
measures and renewed interest by US fishermen in 
the Adak area and the Bering Sea.  The Kodiak 
and other GOA stocks supported smaller but more 
stable fisheries in the late 1960’s and through the 
1970’s, only to decline sharply, leading to many 
fishery closures in 1982 and 1983.  Only small 
fisheries in the eastern GOA have been allowed 
since.  The Adak fishery declined in the early 
1970s and has never fully recovered, although 
small (ca. 500 t) fisheries have been allowed in 
most recent years.

Fig. 24  Commercial landings and CPUE of 
Bristol Bay red king crab, 1953-1996. 
In the remainder of this time period, red king crab 
abundance in the EBS and the Russian Far East 
became clearly out of phase with each other.  
Hokkaido and Adak fisheries had some similarities, 
and both have done poorly in recent years.  In 
Hokkaido, red king crab fisheries have recently been 
supplanted by Hanasake gani and hair crab (Fig. 25).  
One wonders if the abundance of hair crab indicated 
a change in ecological conditions.  Almost all GOA 
red king crab fisheries have been at extremely low 
levels since the early 1980’s and fishery independent 
surveys show virtually no sign of recovery.  The 
decline of GOA red king crab has been attributed to 
over fishing (serial depletion of Orensanz et al. 1998, 
Fig. 26) and changing ecological conditions.  The 
lack of discernible recovery despite fishery closure 
from 1982 to present suggests a fundamental change 
in the habitat or a broad scale climatic phenomenon.  
 
The American National Marine Fisheries Service 
(NMFS) has conducted annual trawl surveys of the 
EBS to collect data on abundance, distribution and 
biology on five species of crabs and over ten species 
of groundfish.  The area surveyed encompasses the 
adult distributions of most commercial species, but 
frequently does not cover an entire species’ range.  
For example, immature king crab, less than three 
years, are typically found inshore on rocky grounds 
or other untrawled shallow areas.  The EBS survey 
takes place annually during late May, June, July and 
August to avoid the spring crab molting periods.  
Over the period 1979-1994, the area covered, 
sampling density and timing of the survey have been 
similar.  The habitat of Bristol Bay red king crab has 
been well covered since 1968, and there are some 
data available from the 1950s.  Areal abundance 
indices are calculated by an area-swept technique 
(Alverson and Pereyra 1969, Hoopes and Greenough 
1970), assuming a catchability of 1.0.  Abundance 
indices are relative rather than absolute since there 
are very little data on catchability of juvenile crabs in 
the trawl or their actual availability to the survey.  
For management purposes, it is usually assumed that 
virtually all commercial-sized crab in the trawl’s 
path are captured.  Smaller males and females are 
probably less vulnerable than commercial-sized 
males.  A detailed report (e.g., Stevens et al. 2000) is 
published each year and is also available on line 
(http:  //www.afsc.noaa.gov/ kodiak/).  Survey data 
are primarily used in stock assessment models (e.g., 
Zheng et al. 1998, Zheng and Kruse 1995).

The West Kamchatka stock of red king crabs 
seems to follow a basic denatent-contranatent life 
history pattern (Fig. 27), where adults occur up 
current from juvenile nursery grounds and show a 
contranatent ontogenetic migration to the adult 
habitat (Rodin 1985, 1990).  Sub-population units 
of adults have their own seasonal pattern of 
offshore-onshore migration that is apparently 
mediated by temperature.  This life history pattern 
is similar to those described by Jones (1968) for a 
wide variety of marine fishes.  Positioning of 
females at the time of egg hatching relative to 
long-shore currents appears important for king 
crabs.  The life history pattern of Bristol Bay red 
king crab appears similar to that of the West 
Kamchatkan stock, except that there is currently 
only one area or sub-population of adults (Rodin 
1990).  In both populations, the spatial structure of 
adults appears to be important and the critical 
juvenile habitat appears to be limited in area.  
Searching benthic habitat by megalopae (= 
glaucothoe) appears to be an important mechanism 
whereby larval settling on an appropriate substrate 
is insured (Stevens and Kittaka 1999). 
 
Throughout most of the GOA and eastern 
Aleutians, red king crab populations declined from 
the late 1970s until the fisheries were closed in 
1983 (Fig. 26).  Populations have been at low 
levels and fisheries closed since 1983.  
31
 
Populations declined soon after the now 
recognized regime shift (Anderson et al. 1997, 
Anderson and Piatt 1999) of the late 1970’s, and 
this offers an opportunity for both retrospective 
study and comparative study with Asian 
populations that have differing patterns of 
abundance over time.  Comparative study of 
Bristol Bay and West Kamchatkan populations 
may be particularly instructive.  Over the past 20-
30 years it appears that southern stocks of red king 
crab (Hokkaido, Adak, GOA) have not fared as 
well as more northerly stocks (EBS, West 
Kamchatka).

4  Major Species and Stocks of Shrimps in the PICES Region 
 
Three families of shrimps are commercially 
important in the PICES Region.  Sergestidae 
include the akiami paste shrimp (Acetes chinensis 
and Acetes japonica, Plate 2), which support the 
largest shrimp fishery in the PICES Region, as 
well as the world.  The Penaeidae are well-
represented in the waters of China, North and 
South Korea and southern Japan.  Major penaeid 
(Plate 3) fisheries exploit southern rough shrimp 
(Trachysalambria curvirostrus), kuruma prawn 
(Marsupenaeus japonicas), fleshy prawn 
(Fenneropenaeus chinensis) and shiba shrimp 
(Metapenaeus joyneri).  The Pandalidae include 
the genera Pandalus and Pandalopsis (Plate 4), 
and this family accounts for virtually all shrimp 
landings from northern Japan around the North 
Pacific’s rim to California.  In terms of volume, 
the northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis, or eos) 
and the ocean shrimp (Pandalus jordani) have 
been most important economically, although six 
additional species have contributed substantially to 
the catch in various areas.  Landings identified as 
belonging to these three families have made up 
93.8% of shrimp landings within the PICES 
Region over the last 15 years, according to FAO 
statistics (Table 11).  Shrimps of all types are 
ecologically important and a significant source of 
food for fishes, some marine birds (Hunt et al. 
1981) and pinnepeds. 
 
Penaeid and sergestid shrimps differ from 
pandalids in that they are not hermaphroditic, are 
semelparous rather than multiparous, and are 
relatively short lived.  Most species complete their 
life spans in less than two years and frequently 
within one year, while pandalid shrimps typically 
live for at least three years and sometimes for 
seven to eight years.  Sergestid and penaeid 
shrimps also spawn their eggs directly into the 
water column, in marked contrast to pandalid and 
crangonid shrimps that incubate their eggs on their 
pleopods for several months.  All shrimps 
considered here have meroplanktonic larvae that 
are dispersed by currents, and inshore-offshore 
movements of larvae and adults appear to be 
important life-history phases.

Mantis shrimps (Plate 5) are not true shrimps or 
even decapods, but are included here as a matter of 
convenience rather than strict biological usage.  
Mantis shrimp provide for a small, interesting, and 
well-described fishery in Chinese waters, but are 
also harvested in Japan and South Korea to a 
minor degree.

4.1  Akiami paste shrimps (Acetes spp., 
Sergestidae, FAO Area 61) 
 
The akiami paste shrimps (Acetes chinensis and 
Acetes japonicus) support fisheries in China, 
South Korea and Japan, and are among the 
northern most species of this circumtropical genus.  
These two species overlap in their geographic 
ranges and are generally not distinguished in 
landing statistics.  The vast majority of world 
landings are taken in China, with South Korea, 
according to the FAO, a distant second (Table 11).  
World landings of Acetes are likely to be grossly 
underestimated since important fisheries are 
known to occur in India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, 
the Philippine Islands, and various other parts of 
southeast Asia.  The genus is ecologically 
important in many areas of its occurrence and has 
been recognised as a key biological component of 
the Bohai Sea. 
 
Most of what follows is taken from Zhaung and 
Deng (1999) and refers to Acetes chinensis, the 
species that dominates the fishery in the Bohai 
Sea.  Other references include Jo and Omori 
(1996), Zhang (1992), and Zhang and Guangzu 
(1992a,b).  In China, this is the most important 
species and it is caught with various fixed, bag-
like nets.  Chinese landings averaged 223,934 t 
from 1976 to 1997, with an average of 197,108 t 
(90.0%) coming from the PICES Region.  In the 
Bohai Sea, the fishery has a 300-year history and 
currently accounts for about one third of all 
landings there.  The fishery is also extremely 
important in the East China Sea.  Within the 
Chinese PICES Region, 45.6% of landings are 
from the Bohai-Yellow Sea area and 54.7% are 
from the East China Sea (1976-1997).  These 
production figures are astounding, considering that 
the body lengths of mature paste shrimp are 17-32 
mm for males and 18-43 mm for females, and a 43 
mm female is approximately 0.5 g:

South Korean landings from the Yellow Sea 
increased from 10,000 t in 1984 to 29,000 t in 
1992, and have decreased to 16,000 t in recent 
years.  This shrimp is usually caught in the spring 
and autumn by fixed long bag-like nets.

Spawning occurs twice per year, with 
spring/summer (SS) and summer/autumn (SA) 
generations, and most of both brood stocks die 
after reproduction.  During the spring, gonads 
mature after wintering and spawning begins in 
June.  The SS stock grows quickly in the summer 
and reproduces to form the SA generation.  
Akiami paste shrimp the longest life span is only 
one year.  The sex ratio is about 1:1.  Body length 
(BL) of mature male and female individuals range 
from 17-32 mm and 18-43 mm respectively, and 
size frequency structures of two generations are 
different.  Female body lengths of the SS stock 
ranges from 25-40 mm and is dominated by 31-32 
mm shrimp.  Female body lengths of the SA stock 
range from 12-30 mm and is dominated by 20-30 
mm shrimp.  
 
Mating activity takes place about 15 days prior to 
spawning, which takes place in batches and always 
at night.  The relationship between fecundity in 
egg numbers (F) and body length (L) in mm 
(absolute fecundity) is  
 
 F = 0.0309 L
3.62
  
 
Typical SS females produce 7700 to 8700 eggs 
while a 30 mm SA female would produce 6800 
eggs (40.7 eggs mg
-1
 wet weight).  Akiami paste 
shrimp are weak swimmers and do not conduct 
long distance migrations, but there is a seasonal 
movement between shallow (summer) and deep 
waters (winter).  
 
Akiami paste shrimp filter feed on phytoplankton 
(diatoms) and detritus but also actively prey on 
zooplankton (copepods, Sergestidae and bivalve 
larvae).  The diet composition changes with 
habitat and seasons.  With a short life span, the 
abundance of Acetes shrimp may be easily 
affected by natural conditions and human 
activities.  As a result, its annual abundance and 
landings fluctuate extensively (Table 11).  
 
4.2  Penaeid shrimps (Penaeidae, FAO Area 
61) 
 
About 15 species of Penaeidae are commercially 
important in the PICES Region.  Four species of 
penaeid shrimps are important in the Yellow Sea 
and all of them extend their ranges through the 
East China Sea and into waters off southern Japan.  
Of these, the fleshy prawn (Fenneropenaeus 
chinensis), the kuruma prawn (Marsupenaeus 
japonicus), the shiba shrimp (Metapeneaus 
joyneri) and the southern rough shrimp 
(Trachysalambria curvirostris) dominate landings 
(Tables 11 and 13).  Other species are presumably 
included with unspecified natantia in FAO 
statistics. 
 
Economically, the fleshy prawn (Fenneropenaeus 
chinensis), also known as Penaeus chinensis, 
(Osbeck 1765) has been the most important 
commercial species in the Yellow and Bohai Seas.  
It has also been extremely important in China and 
South Korea.  Aquacultural landings in China 
including averaged 167,527 t in China and 1456 t 
in South Korea from 1986 to 1995 (Zhuang and 
Deng, 1999;  and Yeon 1999).  Landings from 
wild stocks in China and South Korea averaged 
36,045 t and 1,163 t, respectively, over the same 
period.  In the Yellow and Bohai seas, fleshy 
prawns have historically been exploited by South 
Korea, Japan, and China.  Japan, however, stopped 
fishing in 1987.  Landings from 1986-1995 were 
14.7% South Korean, 5.1% Japanese and 80.2% 
Chinese, and averaged 7,916 t.  Landings in China 
as a whole, as well as the Yellow-Bohai and China 
Seas, have declined in recent years.  However, 
South Korean landings from wild stocks were 
comparatively high in the middle 1970s at 6,000 t, 
before decreasing dramatically to less than 1,000 t 
in the middle 1980s.  It has shown some sign of 
recovery, perhaps due to the release of cultured 
juveniles every spring since 1986.  The South 
Korean fishing season is April-May for the old 
generation and September-December for the 
young generation.  
  
There are two populations in the Yellow-Bohai 
Sea area.  One is found in the western coastal 
waters of South Korea while the other is found in 
Yellow and Bohai seas.  Although the two 
populations have separate migratory patterns, there 
is some overlap in the Yellow Sea wintering 
grounds.  Fleshy prawns tend to follow the 6°C 
isotherm as they begin their shoreward migration 
in March.  The South Korean coastal stock spawns 
from April to June.  The minimum size of the 
sexually mature shrimp is 38 mm CL in both male 
and female.  After spawning, adults die.  The 
35
 
 
shrimp has one reproductive cohort per year, and 
the life span is 13-14 months.  During summer 
(water temperature, 23-27°C), the juveniles grow 
very fast, up to 14 mm CL by August and up to 45 
mm by November (Cha et al. 2001).  Thereafter, 
they grow very slowly.  Growth equations (Yeon 
1999), using the von Bertalanffy growth pattern, 
are:  
 
 Female:  CL
t
=48.8(1-e
-3.339(t+0.058)
)  
 
 Male:  CL
t
=36.7(1-e
-3.803(t+0.226)
)  
 
The female grows much faster than the male.  The 
summer season is a feeding period that culminates 
with mating in October-November.  There is a 
massive mortality of males immediately after 
mating that leads to a large change in the sex ratio.  
With seasonal cooling, from November onward 
they start migrating to the deeper part of the 
Yellow Sea, where they spend the winter season.  
 
The species has been well studied because of its 
importance to both aquaculture and fishing.  
Fishing, growth and mortality rates are well 
described, as are diseases.  Cohort analysis, yield 
per recruit modelling and stock-recruitment 
relationships are being used in stock assessment.  
Because hatchery techniques are available, 
enhancement through the release of post-larval 
juveniles is being used to augment natural 
reproduction, and this approach has shown some 
promise.  Currently, trawling is forbidden in the 
Bohai Sea and the fishery there is conducted only 
with fixed nets and drift nets.  Trawling is the 
usual means of fishing elsewhere by all nations 
involved. 
 
The shiba shrimp (Metapenaeus joyneri), is 
distributed in the shallow (< 20 m) waters of the 
Bohai, Yellow and East China Seas.  Landings are 
reported to be about 5,000 t annually, but these 
statistics are not considered accurate.  Shiba 
shrimp tend to be localized in distribution and 
show little evidence of migration.  Chinese catches 
are dominated by shrimp of 100-110 mm length 
and weights of 11-13 g.  Spawning occurs both in 
March-May and again in September-December.  
Landings for China were not presented, but FAO 
data show South Korean landings varying from 
2,086 to 7,852 t from 1986 to 1995. 
Off western South Korea, the shiba shrimp starts 
migrating from the deeper part of the Yellow Sea, 
where they spent the winter, to the western coast 
of Korea in the spring when surface water 
temperatures are 12-15°C (Cha et al. 1999).  At 
this time, the gonads of both male and female are 
fully matured.  Minimum size of the sexually 
mature shrimp is 22 mm CL in both male and 
female.  Insemination occurs just before spawning.  
From June to August more than half the females of 
20-21 mm CL are inseminated.  The spawning 
period is from the end of June to August.  Adults 
die after spawning.  This shrimp has one 
reproductive cohort per year.  A female spawns 
from 73,000 to 206,000 eggs (Cha et al. 1999).  
Fecundity is positively proportional to the size of 
the female.  The life span is 14-15 months.  During 
the summer (water temperature, 23-27°C), 
juveniles grow fast, being up to 12 mm CL by 
August.  With autumn, waters cool, and in 
November, they start migrating to the deeper part 
of the Yellow Sea where they spend the winter.  
South Korean catches are composed of shrimp of 
mainly 12-26 mm CL.  Fishing occurs from May 
to June for the old generation and from September 
to December for the young generation. 
 
The southern rough shrimp, or cocktail shrimp 
(Trachysalambria curvirostris), also known as 
Trachypenaeus curvirostris, (Stimpson 1860) is 
extremely widely distributed, from Africa to 
Australia, as well as in southern and eastern Asia, 
including off China, Japan and Korea.  Despite a 
wide distribution, directed fishing largely occurs 
in the PICES Region only in China and South 
Korea.  In the PICES Region, the southern rough 
shrimp is particularly abundant in the Bohai and 
Yellow Seas.  Coastal waters of Shandong 
Province and Korean western waters are major 
fishing grounds.  It is also found in the East China 
Sea.  Most fishing occurs during the reproductive 
and wintering seasons (in China) or during the 
inshore and offshore migrations (in South Korea), 
when dense schooling occurs.  Habitat is generally 
20 to 40 m in the Bohai and Yellow Seas.  
Spawning begins in May and peaks in June and 
July.  The minimum size of the mature female is 
estimated at 14 mm CL.  Fecundity is directly 
proportional to the size of the female, with the 
clutch size varying from 16,000 to 115,000 eggs 
(Cha 1997).  As is true of other penaeids, the diet 
36
 
 
includes small mollusks, planktonic polychaetes, 
and crustaceans.  
 
Chinese landings from the Yellow and Bohai Seas 
have increased drastically over the past 20 years, 
averaging 48,018 t for 1988-1997 as compared to 
15,557 t during the previous decade.  While there 
is potential for further development in the South 
and East China Seas, the Yellow and Bohai Seas 
are considered over-exploited.  South Korean 
landings were 11,000 t in 1994.  Thereafter, they 
decreased sharply to 3,000 t.  Catches are 
dominated by shrimp of 12-24 mm CL.  Individual 
size varies greatly from summer through autumn 
and the next spring.  Growth shows a seasonal 
pattern, as 
  
Female:  CL
t
=21.80(1-e
-{3.175(t-0.047)+(5.700/2π)sin2π(t-0.057)}
) 
Male:  CL
t
=17.00(1-e
-{2.237(t+0.199)+(3.864/2π)sin2π(t-0.069)}
) 
 
The female grows faster and larger than the male 
(Yeon 1999).  Management measures being 
considered include catch quotas on the wintering 
population, time area closures to protect spawning 
concentrations, and effort limitations for both 
motorized trawling and fixed nets. 
 
The karuma prawn (Marsupenaeus japonicus), 
also known as Penaeus japonicus, (Bate 1888) is 
also extremely wide-spread with a distribution that 
extends from western Africa to Japan and as far 
south as Australia.  It is one of the world’s most 
popular aquacultural species and aquacultural 
landings probably far exceed wild stock 
production.  The kuruma prawn was the first 
penaeid species in the world to be successfully 
propagated under controlled conditions.  It is the 
most widely cultured among temperate penaeid 
species, being expensive, tasty and colorful (Chiu 
and Chien 1994).  Rothlisberg (1998) reviewed the 
recent literature on aspects of the biology and 
ecology of penaeid prawns that are relevant to the 
aquaculture research community and the 
aquaculture industry;  giving much information on 
the karuma prawn.  Aquaculture may also have 
accidentally introduced the karuma prawn to new 
areas, such as the eastern Mediterranean, although 
it may have occurred naturally via the Red Sea.  
 
In South Korea and parts of Japan, these shrimp 
are taken with gill nets, which has lead to various 
selectivity experiments (e.g., Lee et al. 1986, 
Fujimori 1996).  Gear selectivity of trammel nets 
with different mesh sizes on kuruma prawn were 
conducted in Ohmi Bay, Japan, and under 
controlled conditions in a tank at the Yamaguchi 
Prefecture Naikai Fisheries Experimental Station 
(Fujimori et al. 1996).  These experiments resulted 
in an optimum mesh size recommendation of 42.8 
mm for kuruma prawn of 110-140 mm body 
length.  
 
The reproductive biology of female kuruma prawn 
was investigated in the Ariake Sea and Tachibana 
Bay, Japan, by Mingawa et al. (2000) to elucidate 
interannual, seasonal, individual female body size 
and spatial influences on the incidence of 
spawning.  Minimum size at maturity was 130-140 
mm BL.  The proportion inseminated increased 
with body size up to 170 mm BL and then 
decreased.  Spawning occurred in the central part 
of the Ariake Sea and Tachibana Bay from mid-
May to mid-October, but occurred in the western 
central part, from mid-June to mid-September.  
Breeding in Korea occurs in May and June.  
Females carry ca. 700,000 eggs. 
  
A quantitative study of brain lipofuscin content 
from known-age, pond-reared karuma prawns 
(Vila et al. 2000) showed that the concentration of 
lipofuscin increased significantly with age and was 
independent of sex.  The relationship between age 
and lipofuscin concentration was described by a 
seasonalised von Bertalanffy function, since 
accumulation of the pigment slowed in fall and 
winter.  Results indicate that the lipofuscin method 
is useful to estimate physiological age in penaeids 
and it could be useful in studies of age structure in 
wild populations.  
 
A marking method for the kuruma prawn was 
developed by Miyajima et al. 1999.  The method 
involves cutting the uropod which results in much 
reduced pigmentation in the regenerated part.  The 
degree of pigment reduction increased with body 
length of prawn used, and a 50% reduction in 
comparison with uncut uropods occurred for 60 
mm in BL.  Laboratory studies showed little 
mortality.  Field testing at sea proved successful 
application of a long-lasting mark to large 
samples, and presumably the method could be 
37
 
 
used to verify lipofuskin data of for population 
estimation. 
 
The main fishing grounds off South Korea are 
located near Kojedo.  Fishing grounds in Japan are 
wide spread and various in their characteristics.  
Landings of wild stock in the PICES Region have 
varied from 3,200-7,700 t in the past 15 years of 
record (Table 12). 
 
Four of the important penaeid species 
(Marsupenaeus japonicus, Fenneropenaeus 
chinensis, Metapenaeus joyneri, and 
Trachysalambria curvirostris) were contrasted in 
our discussions and were found to differ 
considerably in their life history patterns within 
the Yellow Sea, which offers opportunities for 
comparative studies of environmental effects on 
recruitment.  A joint South Korean-Chinese study 
of shrimp stock recruitment relationships in the 
Yellow Sea is being planned.  This study would 
likely be profitable and has the advantages of 
occurring in a well-defined, semi-enclosed body of 
water, and utilising a relatively short-lived species, 
allowing the results of experiments to be more 
readily available.  The kuruma prawn also occurs 
over large areas and offers similar opportunities. 
 
4.3  Pandalid shrimps (Pandalidae, FAO Area 
61, 67) 
 
Pandalid shrimps are protandric hermaphrodites, 
and larger, older, mostly mature females 
individuals support fisheries.  They are 
multiparous and may breed three to five times.  
There are about nine species of commercially 
exploited pandalid shrimps in the PICES region.  
All pandalids are taken in trawl fisheries either as 
target species or incidental catch.  The main 
targets of trawl fisheries are ocean pink shrimp 
(Pandalus jordani), northern pink shrimp 
(Pandalus borealis/ eos, Plate 4), humpy shrimp 
(Pandalus goniurus, Plate 4) and sidestriped 
shrimp (Pandalopsis dispar, Plate 4).  Note that 
here we depart from the American Fisheries 
Society’s (Williams et al. 1989) nomenclature by 
using the subspecies eos respecting the northern 
shrimp.  Recent authors (see Komai 1999) have 
referred to the Pacific form of this species as P. 
eos while retaining P. borealis for the Atlantic 
form.  We are aware that collections are being 
made for DNA analysis of many collections at this 
time and have chosen to incorporate both names.  
Schumway et al. (1985) reviewed the biology of 
northern pink shrimps.  The dock shrimp 
(Pandalus dana, Plate 4) and morotoge shrimp 
(Pandalopsis japonica) are often caught in trawls 
but seldom abundant enough to be a target species.  
The main targets of pot (trap) fisheries are the spot 
prawn (Pandalus platyceros, Plate 4) and, less 
commonly, the coonstriped shrimp (Pandalus 
hypsinotus, Plate 4), although other species are 
commonly taken.  
 
Spot prawns (Pandalus platyceros) are distributed 
from California to Alaska as far west as Unalaska 
Island (NMFS, unpublished) and to the Japan/East 
Sea.  Hokkai shrimp (Pandalus latirostris) and 
morotoge shrimp are confined to Asia, while 
sidestriped shrimp are known from the western 
Bering Sea (near Cape Navarin) and North 
America.  The remaining species are found 
variously on both continents.  Landings occur over 
a broader geographic range within the PICES 
Region but reported landings are somewhat less 
than those for penaeids (Tables 10 and 13).  In 
South Korea, catches of this family of shrimp are 
small and are not recorded officially, so landing 
data is not available.  
 
The hokkai shrimp is a shallow water species 
unique to the Japan/East Sea, Hokkaido, southern 
Sakhalin Island and the southern Kurile Islands, 
where it is most commonly found in association 
with eel grass beds.  It is taken in small trawls, 
push nets and hand nets of various sorts.  Hokkai 
shrimp are green, with a striped body that 
doubtless helps them to conceal themselves in 
eelgrass beds.  Hokkai shrimp are a common 
species in Japanese shrimp fisheries but specific 
information on them is fragmentary.  
 
Pandalid shrimp populations and fisheries in 
Alaska collapsed in the late 1970’s (Table 14, Fig. 
28) and most fisheries remain closed today.  Very 
small trawl fisheries for sidestriped shrimp and 
modest pot fisheries for spot prawns still persist in 
some areas in Alaska.  The collapse of the 
pandalid shrimp complex in Alaska was 
concurrent with the late 1970s oceanographic 
regime shift and a sharp increase in predator 
populations, particularly those of Pacific cod 
38
 
 
(Gadus macrocephalus, Albers and Anderson 
1985).  Anderson et al. (1997) and Anderson and 
Piatt (1999) showed that the regime shift in the 
GOA was accompanied by a sharp reduction in the 
abundances of a number of forage species 
(especially capelin, Mallotus villosus) and 
crustaceans.  Humpy shrimp, which were once 
common in western Alaska, have been virtually 
absent from recent surveys. 
 
Landings of ocean pink shrimp also declined 
sharply in the late 1970s, and reached their lowest 
levels in 1983.  In contrast with northern pink 
shrimp populations in Alaska, they later increased 
in abundance.  Landings of ocean pink shrimp 
have undergone two cycles between 1970 and 
1995 (see California, Oregon & Washington 
landings in Table 15).  The recovery of ocean pink 
shrimp there contrasts sharply with that of Alaskan 
populations, and this comparison of shrimp 
population dynamics would make a good 
retrospective study.  One problem is that species 
were frequently combined in landing statistics, 
particularly in trawl fisheries where landings were 
simply referred to as “pink shrimp”.  In some 
cases, biological sampling may be sufficient to 
provide reasonable estimates of species 
composition.  There is a great amount of this sort 
of reconstruction that would need to be done in 
most western Alaska shrimp landing analyses.  
 
Pot fisheries for spot prawn occur mostly from 
Prince William Sound to Northern California.  
There appears to have been serial depletion of 
localized populations as the fishery developed in 
southeastern Alaska (Orensanz et al. 1998, Fig. 
16).  The spot prawn is important economically in 
British Columbia (Boutillier et al. 1998), where it 
is intensively fished.  Fisheries become more 
sporadic in the southern part of this species’ range. 
 
Pandalid shrimps that occur in the Western Bering 
Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk and in the Sea of Japan 
provide additional comparative study possibilities.  
It is frequently unclear whether recruitment to 
populations or mechanisms that concentrate adults 
are most important in forming high densities of 
pandalid shrimp in open ocean environments.  
Both environmental effects and oceanographic 
forcing appear important in recruitment of 
pandalid shrimp stocks in the offshore open ocean 
regions of the eastern Pacific.  Shrimp stocks in 
the inshore, protected regions of the Eastern 
Pacific Ocean seem to be much more stable and 
have not undergone the same fluctuations as have 
the offshore open water stocks.

4.4  Other shrimps 
 
There have also been some recent attempts to 
exploit deepwater glass shrimps, Family 
Pasiphaeidae.  Other species of shrimp such as 
many Crangonidae, which provide important 
commercial fisheries in the northeast Atlantic, are 
present in the PICES Region but are only 
harvested to a minor extent or as incidental catch.  
The genus Argis occurs widely in northern 
portions (EBPR, AR, WBPR) of the PICES 
Region where it is and important forage species 
for groundfish and seals (Lowery and Frost 1981), 
particularly for the bearded seal, or oogruk, 
(Erignathus barbatus).  Minor fisheries for Argis 
spp.  occur in the PICES Region and historically, 
they have occurred as incidental, but utilized, 
catch in trawl fisheries.  There is a new fishery 
being developed by the Russians in the Sea of 
Okhotsk for the extremely colorful hippolytid 
(Lebbeus groenlandicus) (Debelius 1999). 
40
 
 
 
Fig. 28  Pandalid shrimp landings from California to Alaska, 1970-1996. 
 
Interestingly, fisheries for Crangonidae are among 
the oldest crustacean fisheries on the West Coast 
of North America.  The more important “ocean” 
pink shrimp (Pandalus jordani) likely received its 
common name in contraposition to the crangonid 
“bay shrimp” fishery of San Francisco.  The San 
Francisco Bay shrimp fishery began in 1869 
(Israel 1936) and exploited primarily Crangon 
franciscorium, but also Crangon nigricaudata and 
C. nigromaculata (Butler 1980).  Jensen (1995) 
pictures all three species in color.  These species 
are distributed from Alaska to southern California 
but have a significant fishery only in San 
Francisco Bay (Butler 1980).  This fishery was 
first prosecuted with seines but later with bag nets 
and trawls.  Some of the fixed nets used by 
Chinese fishermen in San Francisco Bay were 
similar to those used today in the Bohai Sea, and 
nets were frequently imported from China (Bennot 
1932).  
 
Crangon franciscorium is the largest of the three 
exploited species and reaches a total length of 80 
mm but are more typically 50-70 mm.  Males and 
females both mature at about 38 mm total length 
but females reach a larger size (Isreal 1936).  In 
Gray’s Harbor, Washington, some individuals are 
protandric hermaphrodites but primary females are 
also present (Gavio et al. 1994).  Rathbun (1887) 
commented that this fishery was “by far the most 
important of any there [on the Pacific coast] in the 
line of marine invertebrates”.  Rathbun noted that 
exports reached about $100,000 (perhaps 454 t) in 
1880, with most of the dried export product going 
to China.  However, some 90 t, worth $20,000, 
sold at the San Francisco market.  Bennot (1932) 
tabulated a catch of 135 t in 1915 that increased to 
371 t in 1920, 704 t in 1925 and peaking at 1,386 t 
in 1929.  Isreal (1936) noted a variation in 
recruitment and landings of 59–60.9 t between 
1931-1936.  Breed and Olson (1977) have 
observed incidences of a microsporidian parasite 
in this species to reach seasonal highs of 30%, 
which suggests that parasitism may play a role in 
this species’ population dynamics.  As late as 
1976, landings were 20.4 t, according to U.S. 
National Marine Fisheries Service statistics. 
 
Crangon spp. of several species are found 
throughout the PICES Region and the working 
group noted their occurrences in the diets of a 
wide variety of finfish (Jewett and Feder 1981, 
Livingston et al. 1993).  Wahle (1985) provided 
both a detailed summary of their feeding ecology 
41
 
 
in San Francisco Bay and an important literature 
review of feeding ecology of Crangon. 
 
4.5  Spiny lobsters (Palinuridae, FAO Area 
61, 77) 
 
The larval life history of spiny lobsters (Panulirus 
spp.) is very complex with several stages of 
phyllosoma that drift with the ocean currents 
before transforming into a puerulus prior to 
settling.  Laboratory studies (Sekine et al. 2000) 
suggest that the phyllosoma stage of the Japanese 
spiny lobster (Panulirus japonicus, Plate 5) lasts 
from 231-417 days (mean = 319.4 days), and tends 
to increase with the size of rearing tanks.  
Phyllosoma larvae are large and reach 27.9 to 34.2 
mm during their last stage, which is 11-26 days.  
Carapace length of the puerulus stage is 6.0-8.0 
mm and its duration is 9-26 days.  The duration of 
the puerulus stage appears to be controlled by both 
water temperature and nutritional conditions 
during the phyllosoma stage.  Further laboratory 
studies (Morikawa et al. 2000) reported that 
Japanese spiny lobsters tend to feed more actively 
during the night than the day, and that the rate was 
temperature dependent.  Feeding ceased at 
temperatures below 13.7ºC.  At higher 
temperatures, feeding activity increases.  
Laboratory studies suggest that temperature 
directly determines the northerly limits of spiny 
lobster distribution.  Matsuda and Yamakawa 
(1997) described the effects of temperature on the 
growth of juvenile and adult Japanese spiny 
lobsters in the laboratory.  This suggests there is 
considerable variation in growth rates within the 
thermal-geographic range of the species. 
 
The distribution of Japanese spiny lobster 
phyllosoma larvae and free-swimming pueruli off 
the south coast of Kyushu Island was studied by 
Yoshimura et al. (1999) along transect lines that 
crossed the Kuroshio Current.  These authors 
suggested that final stage phyllosoma larvae occur 
in or near the Kuroshio Current, and that molting 
to the puerulus stage also occurred in the same 
area.  Free-swimming pueruli, however, were 
mostly found north of the Kuroshio Current, which 
suggests that pueruli may swim across this current 
to settle in coastal areas.  According to Sekiguchi 
(1997), Japanese spiny lobster larvae are released 
in coastal waters inshore of the Kuroshio Current, 
disperse into it or are transported into the 
Kuroshio-Counter Current Subgyre, re-enter the 
Kuroshio northeast of the Ryukyu Archipelago, 
and then recruit through the Kuroshio to Japanese 
coastal habitats.  Detailed oceanographic studies 
are now needed to trace the long larval drift of 
Japanese spiny lobster larvae. 
 
Yoshimura and Yamakawa (1998) studied the 
benthic ecology of settled puerulus and juvenile 
stages up to 23 mm CL.  Both the settled puerulus 
and juvenile stages were found individually in 
small holes near algae on the side or underside of 
rocks or around boulders in nearshore shallow 
waters. 
 
Megumi (1999) studied the gonadosomatic index 
(GSI), i.e., the ratio of area of the lumen to that of 
the seminiferous tubules, and sperm density by 
season in male Japanese spiny lobsters off Oshima 
Island, Japan.  For functionally mature individuals 
(i.e., above 54 mm CL), germinal cells at all stages 
of spermatogenesis were found in the testis, and 
sperm were present in the vas deferens throughout 
the year.  Seasonal changes in the three 
reproductive indices, however, indicated a distinct 
seasonality in spermatogenesis.  The GSI was 
highest before the spawning season.  Sperm 
densities were highest during and one month after 
the spawning season (from June to September), 
but was significantly lower in the other months.  
 
Growth, age composition, and recruitment of 
Japanese spiny lobster have been estimated from 
length-frequency analyses (Yamakawa 1997).  
Von Bertalanffy growth curves with seasonal 
growth oscillations were estimated for each sex.  
Growth rates fluctuated from year to year, which 
suggests the presence of density-dependent 
processes.  The most prominent age group in the 
catch was age 2.  Mortality rates after age 2 were 
estimated up to ca. 70-80% per year on average.  
The size selectivity of tangle nets for spiny lobster 
was inferred based on the recruitment of age one 
lobsters during the fishing season and its 
fluctuations between years.  It is interesting to note 
that the Japanese spiny lobster fishery is 
conducted with nets while most of the world’s 
lobster fisheries use pots or traps. 
 
42
 
 
Yamakawa et al. (1994) expanded the DeLury’s 
method to include 14 maximum likelihood models 
with variables that included environmental factors 
such as water temperature, lunar cycle, and the 
intensity of ocean waves.  The optimal model was 
applied to catch-effort data from the Japanese 
spiny lobster gillnet fishery.  Models were very 
responsive to water temperature, phase of the 
moon, and ocean wave patterns.  Modeled 
variations in catchability were probably 
attributable to changes in lobster activity patterns 
associated with fluctuations of environmental 
factors. 
 
Tuiki et al. (1999) investigated fishery 
management of juvenile Japanese spiny lobsters 
using a fisheries model, fishing data and market 
records.  Predicted yields were compared among 
several patterns of fishing for juveniles in the 
shallow water.  Simulations showed an increased 
yield when the fishing area was regulated, and that 
yield increased despite a constant catch number 
when fishing efforts were concentrated in the last 
months of the season.  Regulation of fishing area 
in concert with an increased proportion of fishing 
effort expended during late fishing periods was 
found to improve the utilization of juveniles. 
 
California spiny lobsters (Panulirus interruptus) 
occur only in the warmer waters south of Point 
Conception, California.  They provide important 
fisheries along the Pacific coasts of Mexico and 
central America.  The fishery is restricted to 
Southern California in the PICES Region, and has 
been regulated since the early 1900s.  There has 
been a closed season between mid-March and 
early October since 1935 to allow for spawning.  
The size limit is 83 mm in carapace length.  
Fecundity studies of Panulirus interruptus on the 
West coast of Baja California  (Pineda Barrera et 
al. 1981) showed that 114 berried females, ranging 
from 63-163 mm carapace length  (235 to 4, 115 g 
total weight) carried an estimated 91,000-
1,988,000 eggs and that  fecundity was inversely 
related to latitude.  California spiny lobsters may 
hence have relatively low fecundity.  Mating 
occurs from January to August and eggs are 
carried from May to August, while molting 
appears to occur mostly from May through 
October (Mitchel et al. 1969).  Laboratory studies 
indicate that there are six phylosome stages that 
occur within a total larval lifespan of up to 114 
days (Dexter 1972).  Settlement of the puerulus 
stage of Pandirus interruptus in Baja California 
showed a conspicuous seasonal cycle where 
autumn (September to October) was the dominant 
season with second minor peak in spring 
(Guzman-del Proo 1996).  Extensive larval 
surveys indicated that recruitment of lobsters 
probably depends on retention of larvae in coastal 
eddies or coastal countercurrents rather than by 
return from offshore waters by the  Equatorial 
Countercurrent or the Equatorial Undercurrent 
(Johnson 1971).  Coastal eddies or countercurrents 
may be particularly important for successful 
recruitment in California where offshore counter 
currents are lacking.  California spiny lobsters are 
important predators of sea urchins, 
Strongylocentrotus franciscanus and S. purpuratus  
(Tegner and Levin 1983), and hence there is a 
possible negative interaction between 
economically important fisheries. 
 
The total commercial catch for lobster in 2000 in 
California was about 356 t, most of which was 
exported to the Far East.  California spiny lobsters 
are one of California’s few stable fisheries because 
commercial landings have ranged between 181 
and 272 t over the past 20 years.  In San Diego 
County, where nearly half of the state's 
commercial catch was brought to the docks, 
lobsters are the most lucrative seafood 
commercially fished.  Last year, 162 t of lobster 
with a wholesale value of $2.2 million were taken 
from local waters.  There is no record of the 
perhaps substantial catches taken by sport divers 
and hoop netters 
 
4.6  Mantis shrimps (Stomatopoda, Squillidae, 
FAO Area 61) 
 
Mantis shrimps are stomatopods (Squillidae) and 
are not closely related to the much more familiar 
decapod shrimps.  DeBelius (1999) provides an 
excellent pictorial presentation of the group.  We 
include them here for comprehensiveness and 
because they are unique and interesting animals, 
although of only small importance economically 
except in the Bohai Sea where one species 
(Oratosquilla oratoria, Plate 5) is commercially 
important.  Mantis shrimps are widely distributed 
in Chinese waters and are also found around Korea 
43
 
 
and Japan, where they were historically more 
important than presently.  Compared to decapod 
shrimps in the area, these animals are slow 
growing and reach 150-175 mm TL length at age 
3.  The maximum size is 210 mm TL (113 g) for 
females and 177 mm TL (68 g) for males.  
 
Mating occurs in September and October.  They 
often occur in burrows during the winter season 
(December to March), leading to low catch rates 
then.  Catch rates are similar during the other 
months.  Larvae first occur in plankton samples in 
May and persist in the plankton for 4-5 months.  
Larvae reach a maximum size of 26 mm TL, as 
compared to 30 mm TL for the first benthic stages, 
observed in November.  In 1982, the spawning 
biomass in the Bohai Sea was estimated at 2,500 t 
and overall abundance was estimated at about 
5,000 t (Zhaung and Deng 1999).

5  Oceanography 
 
In all regions, the oceanography of inshore waters 
is too site specific to be generalized, and so will 
not be discussed here in detail.  This does not 
mean that oceanography at this scale is not 
important to crustaceans, though, as inshore 
oceanographic features seems to be the dominant 
factors in determining many, if not most, 
significant recruitment events with Dungeness 
crab at least.  
 
Thomson (1981) summarized the prevailing 
surface currents in the North Pacific Ocean in 
Figure 29.  Currents in the northwest Pacific (Fig. 
30) are more complex and variable than in the 
northeast Pacific because of a more complex 
topography.  The Kamchatka Peninsula, Japan, 
and the Korean Peninsula create the Okhotsk Sea, 
the Japan/East Sea and the Yellow Sea, while the 
Aleutian Islands create the Bering Sea.  In 
contrast, the east-moving Subarctic Current 
divides when in encounters North America at 
about the latitude of British Columbia, creating the 
southern flowing California Current and the 
northern flowing Alaska Current.  The lack of 
basin-sized water bodies in the north-eastern 
Pacific may mean that the ocean climate there is 
more affected by regime shifts in the North Pacific 
as a whole, although theses events are only now 
just beginning to be understood. 
 
From British Columbia south, there is a wind-
driven seasonal shift in dominant surface coastal 
current direction, with the Davidson Current 
flowing northwards in the winter and it being 
absorbed into the southward flowing, more 
offshore California Current during the summer 
(Fig. 31).  This reversal in current direction in the 
spring in particular appears to have implications 
for at least Dungeness crab.  This species has 
about a four month larval period, and with larval 
hatching in the southern waters prior to the current 
reversal, newly hatched larvae tend to be 
transported offshore and potentially hundreds, if 
not thousands, of kilometers northwards.  The 
reversal of current direction around the middle of 
the larval period then tends to transport larvae 
onshore and southwards.  While the actual 
dispersal fates of individual larvae are unknown, 
there seems to be extensive mixing of larvae from 
most of the nearshore coastal regions where adult 
Dungeness crab occur.

documents/BNI/EnvSpec/report-pdfs/Sect5Figs1. 
PDF) 
 
How regional currents disperse crustacean larvae 
of other species, and in other areas, is largely 
unknown, although there appears to be an 
upcurrent movement of maturing red king crab on 
the western side of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and 
subsequent downstream dispersal of larvae along 
that coast by the counter-clockwise Okhotsk-Kuril 
Current.  
 
At the northern latitudes, there are a number of 
counter-clockwise gyres, notably within the GOA 
and Bering Sea (Fig. 29), of south-eastern 
Kamchatka, and in the Sea of Okhotsk.  There is 
water exchange between the GOA and the Bering 
Sea between the Aleutian Islands, and a strong 
current (East Kamchatka Current) off the eastern 
Kamchatka Peninsula that becomes the Oyashio 
Current off northern Japan.  This latter current 
turns eastward at the Subarctic Boundary, feeding 
the Subarctic Current and West Wind Drift, which 
both move across the Pacific towards North 
America.

West of Japan, branches of the Kuroshio Current 
moves northwards into the Yellow Sea and 
through the Korea (Tsushima) Strait between 
South Korea and Japan into the Japan/East Sea. 
This creates a counter-clockwise gyre towards the 
head of the Yellow Sea, and the Yellow Sea Warm 
Current that sweeps around Korea into the eastern 
portion of the Japan/East Sea, joining the other 
branch of the Kuroshio Current, the Tsushima 
(Warm) Current (Fig. 31).  There is a cold current 
(Korean Cold Current) that flows south from the 
Sea of Okhotsk along the coast in the western 
Japan/East Sea, creating a series of counter-
clockwise gyres.  Surface outflow from the 
Japan/East Sea is eastwards along the northern and 
southern shores of Hokkaido.

In summary, overall oceanography of the North 
Pacific is complex, and any variable that would 
affect many crustacean stocks simultaneously 
would have to be quite widespread and of 
considerable regional influence.  It is generally 
accepted that such a widespread climate shift 
occurred in North Pacific marine ecosystems about 
1977, and there is debate about whether additional 
ones also occurred in 1989 and around 1998 
(McFarlane et al. 2000).  The suggestion for these 
latter regime shifts has come from a composite 
climate index based on three aspects of ocean 
climate conditions (Aleutian Low Pressure Index, 
the Pacific Atmospheric Circulation Index and the 
Pacific Interdecadal Low Pressure Index) being 
linked to decadal changes in eastern Pacific fish 
population parameters (Beamish et al. 1999;  King 
et al. 2000).  To date, evidence of such regime 
shifts has not been shown from crustacean 
landings data, but this does not necessarily mean 
that large-scale oceanographic events are not 
affecting crustaceans.  Rather, the short time series 
of credible data and unexplained population 
collapses form other causes may simply be 
masking potential signals in crustacean 
populations of regime shifts. 
 
5.1  Oceanography and recruitment 
 
Major stocks of crabs and shrimps considered by 
WG 12 inhabit or historically occurred in all of the 
PICES areas identified by the Climate Change and 
Carrying Capacity (CCCC) Program, but not in the 
deep waters underlying the Eastern and Western 
Subarctic Gyres.  There appear to be few trans-
boundary stocks with respect to regions or basins, 
although a given region may contain multiple 
stocks of a species.  For example, the EBS Region 
contains three stocks of red king crab in Norton 
Sound, Bristol Bay and around the Pribilof 
Islands.  PICES areas and identified ocean basins 
are hence often useful geographic units with 
respect to crab and shrimp stocks.   
 
There appears to be no particular climatic or 
oceanographic patterns that are unique to 
crustaceans, as opposed to finfish.  Further the 
same zoogeographic regions that have been 
differentiated for finfish seem to be largely 
applicable to macrobenthic crustaceans.  These 
regions correspond well with the ten PICES-
GLOBEC CCCC Program Components and seem 
to derive from large-scale oceanographic features.  
It is noted, however, that boundaries of 
zoogeographic provinces may change with 
increasing depths. 
 
We noted that there were intraspecific as well as 
interspecific differences in life history 
mechanisms that related to these regions.  These 
differences may provide natural clines or 
dichotomies that could be exploited for 
experiments.  For example, in the Sea of Okhotsk 
(Rodin 1985) and in Bristol Bay (see above), red 
king crab populations appear to be located so that 
there is a classic (Jones 1968) denatant drift of 
larvae to nursery areas and a contranatant 
ontogenetic migration.  By contrast, in the GOA, 
onshore migration of adults and spawning in semi-
enclosed waters seem to be an important 
mechanism (Gray and Powell 1966, McMullen 
1967, Powell 1964, Powell and Nickerson 1965, 
Powell et al. 1973, Powell et al. 1974) to ensure 
that larvae reach suitable nursery grounds.  There 
may be very different climatic effects on these two 
strategies.  Experimentation might deal with 
contrasting growth and mortality between such 
regions. 
 
Primary and secondary production in planktonic 
communities are translated to meroplanktonic 
larval stages of macrobenthic crustaceans and may 
be related to year-class strength through match-
mismatch mechanisms relating to the timing of 
phytoplankton blooms relative to larval release.  
Detritus from upper levels feeds into the 
secondary production of benthic infauna that serve 
as primary food sources for crabs and shrimps, as 
well as other epibenthic fauna.  Also, many 
shrimps make nocturnal vertical migrations in 
order to feed on zooplankton (Barr 1970, Barr and 
McBride 1967, Percy 1970).  
 
Physical properties of the bottom and ecological 
relationships within the benthos have probably not 
been considered very heavily in CCCC Program 
deliberations, but are inescapably important 
relative to crabs and shrimps and other benthic 
crustaceans.  
 
Crabs and shrimps are much less mobile than 
finfish and hypothetically less able to adjust their 
47
 
 
times and places of spawning relative to 
productivity or other conditions in the euphotic 
zone that might affect larval survival.  Benthic 
crustaceans may have to cope with ambient, but 
suboptimal, conditions during egg hatching and 
early life history while many finfish can move 
with water masses to better optimize conditions.  It 
is also noteworthy that many northern species of 
benthic crustaceans carry eggs for about a year 
prior to hatching and that their larval life span is 
long (week-months) relative to most fishes (days 
to weeks).  These consequences of relative 
immobility and long embryonic-larval periods 
could lead to greater variability in recruitment for 
crabs and shrimps as opposed to finfishes of the 
same regions. 
 
Climatic variability may affect crustacean 
populations directly through recruitment processes 
as noted above.  In much of the GOA and EBS, 
effects may also have been mediated through 
predation.  For example the regime shift that 
occurred in the late 1970s produced strong year 
classes of several ground fishes that in turn may 
have resulted in decreased shrimp abundance 
through predation and or competition (Albers and 
Anderson 1985). 
 
Because many of the region’s groundfish are long 
lived, there is an inertia re change in species 
dominance within a region.  A regime shift that 
resulted from short-term climatic or oceanographic 
phenomena could potentially produce long-term 
ecological effects due to the persistence of strong 
year classes.  This may also be relevant with 
respect to longer-lived crustaceans such as king 
and snow crabs. 
 
Top down versus bottom up control of species 
composition and relative abundance is likely very 
different between pelagic and benthic crustacean 
habitats.  Most crabs and shrimps in the region 
have relatively long larval periods (as much as 90 
days) during which they are meroplanktonic.  It is 
not clear how meroplankton might be controlled or 
influenced by the holoplankton community 
through competition or predation.  Interactions 
between the two groups certainly provide a broad 
topic of research and experimentation. 
 
Hypothetically, if both meroplankton and 
phytoplankton abundance were controlled by the 
dynamics of primary productivity, then there may 
be a way to use information on primary 
productivity to model year-class success through 
the larval phases.   
 
Bottom up control may involve the rate of transfer 
of primary production to the bottom as detritus.  
One hypothesis is that warmer conditions are 
conducive to greater zooplankton abundance or 
diversity and greater respiration in the upper water 
column.  Since more energy would be consumed 
in upper layers, less might become available to 
lower layers or the bottom where detritus may be 
consumed by filter feeders, that in turn become 
food for macrobenthic crustaceans.  Wind patterns 
affecting surface water currents appear to be 
important in some cases. 
 
Top down control through predation may occur 
when changes in finfish biomasses result in 
increases or decreases in crab and shrimp 
biomasses.  Albers and Anderson (1985) were able 
to largely account for declines in shrimp biomass 
in Pavlof Bay, Alaska, by using conservative 
estimates of Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) 
predation.  The same might be said of certain 
marine mammals.  For example, bay populations 
of Dungeness crab may be being controlled 
through sea otter predation (Kimker 1985, Shirley 
et al. 1995). 
 
Some crustacean populations may, in part, be 
achieving longer-term stability in abundance 
because of either the coincidental presence of 
favorable oceanographic regimes or the possible 
selection over time of unique larval behaviors.  An 
example of the former is the sustained availability 
of Dungeness crab in McIntyre Bay in Dixon 
Entrance.  This area is the site of continuous 
counter-clockwise current gyre just to the left of 
the northern part of Hecate Strait, which separates 
the Queen Charlotte Islands from mainland BC.  
Dungeness crab have a relatively long planktonic 
larval period (3-4 months) in late winter and 
spring.  While the source of larvae may either be 
local or from some more remote location, 
sufficient larvae seem to always be retained in this 
gyre so as to support a substantial fishery in the 
extensive shallow sand substrate along the 
48
 
 
southern boundary of the gyre.  Crawford and 
Jamieson (1996) modeled the region’s 
oceanographic features, and have demonstrated 
that the gyre retains larvae that might otherwise be 
advected to a less favorable habitat. 
 
An example of selection for unique larval 
behaviors within a population, and the subsequent 
independence of some populations from wide-
scale oceanographic events that may affect other 
populations of the species, is that of Strait of 
Georgia/Puget Sound (Salish Sea) Dungeness 
crab.  Jamieson and Phillips (1993) reported that 
megalopae of these crab have a vertical diel 
migration of about 140 m, whereas outer coast 
megalopae have a vertical diel migration of only 
about 25 m.  The inner waters of the Salish Sea are 
connected to outer coast waters primarily through 
the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which is about 200 m 
deep, 161 km long and 18–27 km wide.  Because 
of the large freshwater discharge of the Fraser 
River into the Strait of Georgia, Juan de Fuca 
Strait has an estuarine flow, with outflowing 
surface water (generally above 100 m depth) and 
deeper inflowing outer coast water.  During the 
spring and summer, daylight is 14-16 hr and night 
is about 8-10 hr.  As a result, Salish Sea 
megalopae are mostly in deeper inflowing waters 
while outer coast megalopae are always in 
outflowing surface waters.  This difference in 
behavior is suggested to prevent Salish Sea larvae 
from being flushed out of the Salish Sea during 
this crab’s long larval period, and by separating 
the crab populations, may allow for the continued 
genetic selection that was required to achieve this 
difference in behavior.  
 
Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) have cyclic 
populations from Central California to 
Washington State, but Alaskan and British 
Columbia landings are more consistent from year 
to year and do not display the cyclic patterns 
observed southwards.  Alaskan landings are not in 
synchrony with that of the contiguous 48 states of 
the U.S. or with Canada, and landings may instead 
be market driven over some portion of the 
historical landings time-series.  Since patterns 
differ between zoogeographic provinces, 
comparative studies may provide insight into 
mechanisms of population control.  
 
The reason for the lack of a cyclic fluctuation in 
abundance not being observed in British Columbia 
appears to be because of local oceanography 
(Thomson et al. 1998).  The brackish water 
outflow from Juan de Fuca Strait arising from 
Fraser River discharge into the inner Strait of 
Georgia moves to the right because of the Coriolis 
force arising from the Earth’s spin.  This outflow 
thus hugs the west coast of Vancouver Island to 
about its northern tip, where it tends to jet 
offshore, and is known as the Vancouver Island 
Coastal Current.  During the summer, when outer 
coast waters from the northern tip of Vancouver 
Island southwards mostly move southwards, this 
inner water coastal current, which averages about 
30 km in width, continues to move northwards.  A 
boundary zone thus exists off the outer coast of 
Vancouver Island between the two counter 
currents, and this seems to operate as a barrier to 
the shoreward movement of Dungeness crab 
megalopae that occur in abundance seaward of the 
Vancouver Island Coastal Current.  As explained 
above, the surface outflow of Juan de Fuca Strait 
contains virtually no Dungeness crab larvae.  
 
Observations (Jamieson et al. 1989) indicated that 
during substantial storm events, which have 
southern winds, water piles up against Vancouver 
Island, which extends to the northwest.  This 
hydraulic head, even though measured in only 
centimeters, can stop the outflow of Juan de Fuca 
Strait waters, thereby removing the countercurrent 
barrier boundary and allowing the Dungeness crab 
larvae concentrated there to move shorewards, 
movement which can be rapid because of the 
storm winds.  To survive after settlement, 
Dungeness crab must settle in waters less than 
about 50 m depth.  Such storm events typically last 
for 5-7 days, and sufficiently strong ones only 
seem to occur infrequently in the spring when 
megalopae are present in abundance.  During the 
past 15 years, substantial crab settlements on the 
West Coast of Vancouver Island only occurred 2-3 
times.  This, coupled with the relative lack of 
suitable sandy substrate off the mostly fjord-like, 
west coast of Vancouver Island, has meant that the 
substantial cycling in abundance of crab 
populations that has characterized California to 
Washington State waters in recent decades has not 
occurred in Canada. 
 
49
 
 
The list of factors used to explain changes in 
Dungeness crab populations is a fair sampling of 
factors that are thought to control crab populations 
in general.  Additionally, predation on adults 
(Livingston et al. 1993), parasitism and epizootic 
diseases (Sparks 1985, Sparks and Hibbits 1979, 
Sparks and Morado 1985) are documented in a 
number of king and Tanner crab populations.  
Tanner and snow crabs have broad distributions 
across several zoogeographic provinces and 
provide opportunities similar to those for king 
crabs.

6  Sampling and Data Analysis 
 
WG 12 discussed this topic very briefly, the major 
issue being skewed distributions resulting from 
aggregated populations and methods of dealing 
with them.  We also discussed catchability 
experiments and improved more quantitative 
visual methods of surveying with submersibles, 
such as a LASER Line Scan System.  A field 
guide to biological sampling and observation 
techniques (Jademec et al. 1999) has been 
developed by the University of Alaska that is an 
excellent protocol for the taking and coding of 
field observations of crabs in general. 
 
6.1  Spatial structuring of crab and shrimp 
populations    
 
Discussions were limited to well known stocks as 
examples of various processes and their effects 
rather than a systematic consideration for all 
stocks that we have identified.  This was necessary 
due to the large number of stocks involved and the 
fragmentary information available for many of 
them.  In general it appears that spatial structure is 
extremely important in the maintenance of 
recruitment for crab and shrimp stocks. 
 
The existence of discrete aggregations at fine 
spatial scales are well known for many crab and 
shrimp stocks.  At large spatial scales, meta-
population structure is often perpetuated by larval 
drift, occasionally to the point that some 
geographical units may be non-functional from a 
reproductive standpoint.  This may be true of snow 
crab in very cold portions of the northern Bering 
Sea where few reproductively active snow crab are 
found (Jewett 1981, Wolotira et al. 1977).  The 
same larval drift may result in genetic interchange 
between populations in the Bering Sea and those 
in the Chukchi Sea (Paul et al. 1997). 
 
Current patterns, and the adaptations of crab 
behaviour to them, re demonstrated by the 
Dungeness crab studies referred to above in the 
section on “Oceanography and recruitment”.  As 
suggested, it can be quite complex, meaning that 
to fully understand any species population 
dynamics, detailed studies will likely be required. 
6.2  Effectiveness of marine sanctuaries and 
restrictions on fishing activities for crabs and 
shrimps 
This topic was also briefly considered.  There are 
apparently few marine sanctuaries that were 
established primarily to protect crabs and shrimps 
in the PICES Region.  One exception is found in 
the northern portion of the West Kamchatka Shelf 
where red king crab nursery grounds are closed to 
both trawling and pot fishing.  Those that might be 
useful in this regard protect habitat for a 
multiplicity of purposes (e.g. no dredging, 
dumping, mineral exploration, removal of 
artifacts, etc) other than perpetuation of adjacent 
fisheries by means of “no-take zones”.  This does 
not preclude establishing sanctuaries for this latter 
purpose, though, and we recognized that 
sanctuaries are being considered in management 
planning for a variety of fisheries.  Most 
frequently, closures to fishing gear of certain types 
are used in the management of crabs and shrimps.  
Reasons for these latter “sanctuaries” are typically 
site-specific, and include allocation across sectors, 
bycatch minimization, minimization of sublegal 
species retention, navigation concerns, and efforts 
to control fleet capitalization.  
 
WG 12 also noted that several areas are now 
closed to bottom trawling to protect crab stocks, 
and that various marine sanctuaries are being 
planned or proposed in the United States, Canada 
and Japan. 
 
Finally, in Canada and the U.S. at least, seasonal 
protection of some crab stocks occurs, not though 
marine protected areas, but through fisheries 
regulations.  These have been established to stop 
both crab fishing and trawling at seasonal times of 
crab molting (soft-shell condition) (see Jamieson 
and Lessard 2000 for Canadian examples).

7.1  Other matters 
 
The Working Group noted with pleasure that the 
NAFO/PICES/ICES Symposium “Pandalid 
Shrimp Fisheries - Science and Management at the 
Millennium” took place in Dartmouth, Nova 
Scotia, September 8-10, 1999, with Jim Boutillier 
of WG 12 as the PICES Co-convener.  PICES 
involvement with this workshop had been 
recommended by WG 12 and we were glad to we 
could participate in its planning.  The last 
international workshop dealing with Pandalidae 
was in Iceland in 1993 and the last symposium 
dealing with pandalid shrimps worldwide was the 
“International Pandalid Shrimp Symposium” held 
by University of Alaska Sea Grant in Kodiak, 
Alaska, in 1979.  There were 96 participants in the 
recent joint symposium including eight invited 
speakers to four sessions.  Sessions included:  1) 
environmental and trophic considerations, 2) stock 
assessments, 3) management, and, 4) harvesting 
and processing.  There were 23 oral presentations 
and 15 posters.  The symposium was attended by 
representatives from 15 nations.  
 
We are glad to note that WG 12 meetings have 
lead to cooperative Canadian-South Korean 
projects.  Dr. In Ja Yeon worked in Nanaimo with 
Dr. Glen Jamieson and colleagues during 2000-
2001, and Dr. Sung-Yun Hong is spending his 
2001/2002 sabbatical in Vancouver and Nanaimo, 
Canada, with DFO researchers.  As a result of 
contacts made at the working group, a two-year 
(1999-2000), joint South Korea-Canada 
collaborative program, involving Dr. Hong, Dr. 
Ian Perry (DFO, Canada) and Mr. Boutillier was 
established to develop early life history 
information on select shrimp and crab species.  A 
South Korean student, Wongyu Park, who 
completed his M.Sc. under Dr. Hong at Pusan 
National Fisheries University, has spent a number 
of months working in Nanaimo describing the 
early life histories of a number of crustacean 
species.  Larvae of sidestriped shrimp, dock 
shrimp, bristly crab (Acantolithodes hispidus) and 
a grooved Tanner crab (Chionoectes tanneri) were 
successfully reared and described (manuscripts for 
primary publication are in preparation).  This 
research will aid studies of shrimp and crab 
recruitment and abundance fluctuations, as well as 
help with determining if grooved and benizuwai 
Tanner crabs represent distinct species or simply 
separate populations on either side of the North 
Pacific.  This work also laid the foundation for a 
53
 
 
Ph.D. study by Mr. Park at the University of 
Alaska, Juneau, that is now in progress.  Part of 
this work was funded through the PICES Trust 
Fund. 
 
We thank our Chinese colleagues for introducing 
us to shrimp aquaculture in China and particularly 
for organizing a trip to their experimental station.  
The extent of aquacultural production was 
impressive.  We note that world-wide aquacultural 
production has generally been growing at a greater 
rate than landings from wild stocks in recent years 
according to FAO Statistics.

In 1996, members were named in May and there was limited time for travel arrangements prior to the 
October meeting. The 1996 meeting was attended by only four members from the United States and 
Canada and was primarily organizational. Attendance was 11 of 15 members in 1997 and 8 of 15 
members in 1998. Five nations were represented in both years. Attendance was 8 of 15 members in 1999 
and this was the first meeting at which all six member-nations were represented. Cumulatively, 17 
members were appointed by national bodies and 12 members attended one or more meetings. At 1997, 
1998 and 1999 meetings members unanimously expressed their belief that scientists from the Democratic 
Peoples Republic of Korea (North Korea) should attend future PICES meetings if possible since we were 
unable to receive information over the full range of several stocks in the Japan/East Sea and the Yellow 
Sea.

(major taxon according to American Fisheries Society Special Publication 17, common names per AFS or 
UN/FAO, if possible). Question marks (?) indicate either uncertainty as to range, importance or general 
interest, or the need for further definition.  Almost all species below have known commercial, recreational 
or subsistence fisheries that exploit them. * = important species considered by WG12

Appendix 4.  Important PICES Region crab, shrimp, and lobster stocks classified as to stock size, abundance 
trends, type and degree of fishery development.  Current stock abundance is intraspecific relative to its 
historical level: small (s), medium (m) and large (l). Long-term trends are periodically fluctuating (P), 
decreasing (D) and increasing (I). Fishery types are characterized as commercial (C), recreational (R) and 
subsistence (S).  Fishery status is characterized as undeveloped (U), developing (D), fully developed (F) or 
closed to commercial fishing(*).
