Executive Summary 
 
 
This is the first report by an international group of experts that looks at the impact of climate change on key 
species in the fisheries in the North Pacific.  Understanding the dynamics of fish populations, in general, is 
difficult, and linking the fisheries of the six PICES member countries to climate was a challenge.  However, 
the authors of the reports worked very hard to produce this first report that is a summary gathered from a vast 
amount of information.  In addition to the summaries and interpretations, there are over 330 references that 
will be invaluable to researchers.  The species selected were key species in fisheries but in some cases, these 
species were chosen because of the availability of data regarding the impact of climate change on them.  Not 
all key species were included because, in some countries, information was not available or, in some cases, the 
recognized expert was not able to participate in the study.  Catches are reported in t and lengths are fork 
lengths (FL) unless indicated.  Climate is considered on annual scales when linked to parameters like 
temperature and salinity.  However, other important scales are used in this report, including the decadal scale 
of approximately 10 years, which is linked to trends in climate or ocean conditions, and is associated with 
climate regimes.  Regimes and regime shifts are one of a number of modes of climate variability that include 
El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), on 3- to 5-year scales, as well as 30-year and 60-year scales.  There is 
some variability in the reporting, which is to be expected. However, the main reason for this report is to 
assemble the information that is available to assist the science community in assessing the impact of climate 
and climate change on North Pacific fisheries. 
 
The following provides a summary of the current understanding of climate change impacts of each PICES 
member country. 
 
Canada  
 
There are five marine ecosystems off the west coast of British Columbia:  (1) Strait of Georgia, (2) west coast 
Vancouver Island, (3) west coast of Queen Charlotte Islands, (4) Queen Charlotte Sound, and (5) Hecate Strait.  
Sea surface temperatures measured at lighthouses around the Strait of Georgia have increased 1°C over 90 
years.  Climate effects on freshwater rivers and lakes are also relevant as the anadromous species of Pacific 
salmon commonly spawn in these ecosystems.  River temperatures and discharge patterns are particularly 
important in southern areas, including the Fraser River, as warm summer temperatures affect the spawning of 
Pacific salmon.  There is a climate related oscillation on land and in the ocean about the middle of British 
Columbia that results in opposite impacts of climate in the north and in the south.  Thus, similar species may 
be affected differently by climate change.  Decadal-scale variability or regimes have major impacts on the 
dynamics of key species in British Columbia marine fisheries.  It was the recognition of changes in 
productivity of many species after the 1977 regime shift that clearly showed that climate and climate change 
profoundly affected key species in the fisheries off Canada’s Pacific coast.  A recent study indicated that the 
stock and recruitment relationships for sockeye and pink salmon from the Fraser River improved significantly 
when they were separated into regimes.  In addition, the productivity or marine survival could vary 
considerably between two adjacent regimes.  This is important, as management strategies should change when 
there is a shift to a low productivity regime or the population could be overfished.  Regimes are generally 
accepted as naturally occurring climate events.  It is not known how global warming will affect the frequency 
of regimes.  One scenario is that the intensity and the storminess may increase towards the end of this century. 
 
In general, the major fisheries on Canada’s Pacific coast remain healthy.  Total landings of all species 
increased during the 1980s and then declined to early 1980 levels.  Catches of Pacific salmon that traditionally 
were the largest in the west coast fishery reached historic low levels by the late 1990s.  Neither the increase nor 
the decrease was expected, but the changes are now generally accepted to be the result of climate changes.  
x 
The impact of climate change and the potential impact of global warming are considered for ten key species 
that accounted for 43 to 73% of the weight of the total landings from 1980 to 2000. 
 
Sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) 
Adult sablefish are abundant in coastal British Columbia waters at depths greater than 200 m.  The average 
commercial landings from 1978 to 2002 were about 4,000 t.  Catches have declined in recent years in response 
to fishing removals and a reduced total biomass.  It is known that sablefish have decadal-scale trends in 
recruitment, and the recent reductions in biomass appear to be related to the poor recruitment in the relatively 
poor productivity regime in the 1990s.  Periods of above average year-class strength coincide with stronger 
Aleutian Lows, more frequent southwesterly winds, below average temperatures in the subarctic Pacific, and 
warmer sea surface temperatures.  Sablefish are long-lived with a maximum age of 113 years.  Long-lived fish 
species are able to adapt to prolonged periods of poor recruitment, providing fishing mortality is not excessive 
during these periods.  It is probable that global warming will not have an impact on adult sablefish, in a time 
frame of 50 years, that will threaten the long-term dynamics of the population.  Global warming may reduce 
egg, larval and juvenile survival for long periods, however, if the stock is not overfished during these periods, 
there should be occasional strong year classes that will rebuild the population.  If the Aleutian Low intensifies 
as a result of global warming, there is also the possibility that recruitment trends may actually improve relative 
to the trends in the past 50 years. 
 
Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) 
Pacific herring traditionally have been a major fishery on Canada’s Pacific coast.  The current fishery removes 
between 30,000 and 40,000 t annually, but fisheries in the late 1950s and early 1960s had annual landings 
exceeding 200,000 t.  Presently, the abundance trends of Pacific herring are closely associated with climate-
related changes in the ocean habitat.  The dominant mode of variability may be the ENSO-scale rather than the 
regime scale.  Pacific herring populations are generally healthy with the population in the Strait of Georgia at 
historic high levels.  Off the west coast of Vancouver Island, the abundance of herring is affected by predation 
from Pacific hake.  Global warming is expected to increase the numbers of Pacific hake that move north into 
the feeding areas off Vancouver Island which will increase the natural mortality of Pacific herring and reduce 
their abundance.  Pacific herring stocks over the next 50 years are expected to continue to fluctuate in 
abundance as they have in the past 25 years. 
 
Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) 
There are two major populations of Pacific hake in Canadian waters.  A coastal stock ranges from southern 
California to Queen Charlotte Sound.  A percentage of this stock migrates north into the waters off the west 
coast of Vancouver Island in the summer.  A smaller stock is resident in the Strait of Georgia.  Canadian 
fishermen catch a percentage of the total exploitable biomass of the coastal stock.  Although there was a 
gradual decline in biomass beginning in the early 1990s, catches were relatively stable at about 85,000 t during 
that decade.  There is a small fishery for hake in the Strait of Georgia.  The strait has been warming since the 
1960s and at the same time hake have increased in abundance.  Global warming is expected to continue 
contributing to the warming trend that may increase the current large biomass of Pacific hake.  The offshore 
stock should also remain at higher abundance levels provided it is not overfished.  If abundance increases, 
more fish will move into the Canadian zone and more will move farther north.  In the summer off the west 
coast, more hake will also increase predation on Pacific herring. 
 
Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis)      
Pacific halibut caught off the west coast of Canada are part of one coastal population that is regulated by the 
International Pacific Halibut Commission.  Currently, the abundance of Pacific halibut is at historic high 
levels.  There has been a small decline in biomass in the population found off Canada, but the population 
remains stable at historic high levels.  Pacific halibut production is closely related to trends in climate and thus 
would be affected by changes in their ocean environment.  Inter-annual and decadal-scale environmental 
variability are the major sources of recruitment variability under the current management strategy.  The period 
xi 
of stronger Aleutian Lows during the 1980s was favourable for recruitment.  Thus, if global warming results in 
a stormier North Pacific in the winter, Pacific halibut should remain at high abundances.  However, 
recruitment into the Canadian zone comes primarily from the north, and global warming may reduce the 
percentage of juveniles that migrate south into the Canadian zone. 
 
Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus)     
Pacific ocean perch is the dominant rockfish in the groundfish fishery, representing about 30% of the catch of 
rockfish which includes about 30 species.  Pacific ocean perch have a maximum age of about 100 years, and 
their schooling habit makes them susceptible to overfishing.  Trends in recruitment are similar to regime-
related trends in climate.  Fish produced during the productive 1977 to 1988 regime support the current 
fishery. It is important to maintain sufficient adult biomass so that the population can take advantage of periods 
of improved recruitment and is not seriously depleted by overfishing during periods of poor recruitment.  If the 
frequency and intensity of intense Aleutian Lows increases, there could be increases in the frequency of strong 
year classes. 
 
Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax)     
Pacific sardines are part of a population that spawns off California and Baja California.  Sardines caught off 
the west coast of Canada mainly are seasonal migrants from the south.  Sardine populations experience large 
and sudden fluctuations in abundance.  The Canadian sardine fishery collapsed in 1947.  It is now recognized 
that the sudden collapse resulted from overfishing at a time of unfavourable environmental conditions.  
Virtually no sardines were observed in the Canadian zone through to the early 1990s.  The increases in the 
1990s appear to be related to a rebuilding of the population off California after the 1977 regime shift.  There is 
a synchrony among Pacific sardine populations around the North and South Pacific, indicating that the large 
fluctuations in populations are a consequence of large-scale changes in climate and ocean conditions that affect 
carrying capacity.  The decline in the sardine population around Japan following the 1989 regime shift might 
indicate a decrease in the California population.  Thus the current abundance and associated small fishery may 
be reduced naturally as the population declines following the 1989 regime shift.  Global warming impacts are 
unlikely to change the natural cycles in abundance and could result in larger abundances moving into the 
Canadian zone during favourable regimes.  There also may be small, residual stocks that remain in the 
Canadian zone all year as a result of the reduced fishery. 
 
Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus)     
Pacific cod in Canada are at the southern limit of their abundance and, therefore, are vulnerable to the expected 
changes in climate.  In the mid-1950s, Pacific cod were common in the Strait of Georgia and off the west coast 
of Vancouver Island.  Currently, there are few Pacific cod in the Strait of Georgia and abundances are low off 
the west coast of Vancouver Island.  The current fishery is mainly in Hecate Strait where catches ranged from 
8,879 t in 1987 to 200 t in 2001.  Catches generally have been very low since the mid 1990s.  Laboratory 
studies indicate that cod eggs do not survive well in warmer water.  Bottom temperatures in February that 
exceed 8.5°C would most probably reduce or eliminate recruitment.  Global warming will warm the bottom 
waters in the Strait of Georgia and off the west coast of Vancouver Island.  Thus Pacific cod should gradually 
disappear from these areas.  Stocks in Hecate Strait may also be affected, with only a few years during 
favourable regimes when directed fisheries could occur. 
 
Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) 
Pink salmon currently are not highly esteemed in British Columbia, thus catches are not a good indicator of 
abundance.  In recent years the coast-wide escapements of pink salmon may have doubled or tripled compared 
to abundances in the 1960s and 1970s.  In the past few years, production of pink salmon from the Fraser River 
was at historic high levels.  Favourable ocean conditions and reduced exploitation rates are probably the 
reasons for the general increase in abundance, although the mechanisms linking climate to the improved 
production are poorly understood.  Pink salmon from the Fraser River traditionally account for about 60% of 
the total catch in odd-numbered years.  The stocks in the Fraser River are close to the southern limit of their 
xii 
distribution.  Therefore, it is expected that the current increases may be short lived.  It is known that trends in 
climate and productivity are related, thus any intensification of the Aleutian Low could result in increased 
production in northern areas where river temperatures are not too warm.  Basin-scale changes in pink salmon 
growth, survival, and straying rates may be useful indicators of large-scale climate change. 
 
Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka)     
Sockeye salmon are probably the single most important fish species in the British Columbia fishery.  Fraser 
River stocks have traditionally averaged about 80% of all sockeye salmon production in British Columbia.  A 
recent analysis of stock and recruitment trends for the Fraser River stocks showed that productivity is 
associated with climate regimes.  The study indicated that there was a decrease in production in the 1990s, but 
marine survivals improved after the 1998 regime shift.  Fraser River sockeye salmon are also at the southern 
limit of their distribution.  There is little doubt that a warming of the river and changing seasonal flow pattern 
will decrease the productivity of the stocks.  Ocean conditions during their early marine period will also affect 
recruitment.  However, it is difficult to predict how prey for sockeye salmon in the Strait of Georgia will be 
affected.  In general, global warming is not good news for Fraser River sockeye whose current levels of 
productivity may decline. 
 
Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta)     
Chum salmon may exist in about 800 rivers in British Columbia.  They are some of the last species to return to 
fresh water, and thus are the last species caught in the commercial fisheries.  Stock assessments generally show 
that stocks have been relatively stable for approximately the past 30 years.  Catches increased from the mid-
1980s to 1990s, but declined in the late 1990s, apparently due to reduced market demand.  Chum salmon in the 
Fraser River and around the Strait of Georgia will be more affected by the warming of freshwater spawning 
and rearing areas than the more northern stocks.  It is probable that the productivity of wild stocks will decline.  
However, hatcheries produce a large number of chum fry which mitigate the impact of changes in freshwater 
temperatures and flows.  Thus, it is the effects of a changing climate on survival in their early marine period 
that will be most influential.  As reported for sockeye salmon, these impacts are largely unknown at this time. 
 
 
Japan 
 
Japan had the world’s largest fisheries from 1972 to 1984.  Catches reported by the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) reached a maximum of 12,820,000 t in 1984 and then declined.  By 2000, catches were 
approximately 3.7 million t representing 5.1% of the world’s catch.  At present, Japan remains the largest 
importer of fish products in the world.   
 
The structure and dynamics of the subarctic Oyashio current, the subtropical Kuroshio and Tsushima currents, 
and the transition area between the Oyashio and the Kuroshio have a major influence on the productivity of 
species important to the Japanese commercial fisheries.  The changes in currents affect the vertical mixing of 
water which ultimately affects the planktonic food supply for fishes. Changes in the species composition, 
distribution and abundance of plankton are particularly important for the survival of larval and juvenile fishes. 
A doubling of CO
2
 (relative to 1990 levels) is estimated to increase sea surface temperatures along the coast of 
Japan by 1.6°C.  Along the Pacific coast the change would be 1.2° to 1.6°C, and 1.8°C along the coast of the 
Okhotsk Sea.  If trade winds weaken, the Oyashio and Kuroshio Currents would weaken and mixed layer 
depth would shallow, reducing the nutrient supply to the subarctic gyre which would decrease production in 
the Oyashio region.  Another interpretation is that the Aleutian Low would intensify, resulting in a stormier 
winter which would improve productivity.  The impacts of climate and ocean changes are poorly understood 
and will vary among areas and species.  It is clear, however, that climate and ocean conditions have major 
impacts on the productivity of key commercial fishes around Japan.  
 
The impacts of climate change are considered for nine species that represent approximately 58 to 80% of the 
total catch from 1980 to 2000. 
xiii 
Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus)     
The Tsushima Current and Pacific stocks contribute to the catch.  The Tsushima Current stock is distributed in 
the East China Sea, Yellow Sea, Bohai Sea and the Japan Sea.  The Pacific stock is distributed along the 
Pacific coast of Japan, east to the central North Pacific Ocean, including the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) 
of Russia.  Productivity was high in the early 1970s and catches were high in the 1980s when the Pacific 
Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was negative and the Aleutian Low was intense.  After the 1977 regime shift there 
was a decrease in productivity.  After the 1989 regime shift productivity did not recover, possibly because of 
excessive fishing mortality, especially for immature fish.  Productivity tends to be similar to the Japanese 
sardine and Pacific saury.  Global warming-induced climate change will affect production, depending on how 
the trends in winter wind intensity changes.  Warming of the spawning areas in the winter will have a negative 
impact on productivity as will more intense Aleutian Lows or a positive PDO. 
 
Jack mackerel  (Trachurus japonicus)    
Jack mackerel mature at age 1 year and live to about 5 years.  Catches mostly increased in the 1990s and 
remained over 300,000 t until 1999 when they decreased to about 200,000 t in 2002.  Two stocks are 
recognized, the Pacific stock and the Tsushima Current stock.  Both spawn in the East China Sea.  There may 
be a relationship with the PDO in which a positive PDO (e.g., in the 1980s) reduces productivity and a 
negative PDO (e.g., in the 1990s) increases abundance. 
 
Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus)     
Japanese sardine abundances fluctuate naturally on decadal scales, in synchrony with sardine populations off 
the west coast of North and South Americas.  Abundance and catch of Japanese sardine drastically declined 
immediately after the 1988 regime shift, owing to recruitment failures.  Two stocks, the Pacific stock and the 
Tsushima Current stock, are distinguished by their distribution and migration patterns.  Distributions and 
spawning areas fluctuate as the population size fluctuates.  Large-scale climate changes strengthen or weaken 
the winds and ocean currents off the coast of Japan that, in turn, affect nutrient upwelling, plankton production 
and larval transport.  It is the mortality during the first feeding stage that primarily controls year-class strength.  
In the subtropical waters, deeper mixed layers typical during the positive phase of the PDO contain more 
nutrients in the spring and thus provide more food for the larval sardines.  If unfavourable conditions persist 
for more than 7 years, the life span of the Japanese sardine, the population that migrates over a wide area 
would collapse.  The coastal population would remain, but would be small as their coastal habitat is limited.   
The impacts of global warming depend on the change in the frequencies and intensity of regimes, which are 
still speculative. 
 
Anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) 
There is an alternating trend in abundance between anchovy and sardines, indicating that the impact of global 
warming will be opposite for the two species.  Three stocks are recognized in the Japanese fishery: the Pacific 
stock, the Seto Inland Sea stock and the Tsushima Current stock.  Stocks may expand off the coasts of Russia, 
Korea and China.  Current catches are high, averaging over 317,000 t between 1990 and 2000.  Global 
warming-induced intensification of winter winds will not be favourable for anchovy production, but weaker 
winds on a decadal scale will increase productivity.  It is clear that climate-related trends in productivity of 
anchovy and sardines will be opposite. 
 
Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) 
Four stocks are recognized around Japan: the North Japan Sea stock, the Kitami (Okhotsk Sea) stock, the 
Nemuro stock, and the Pacific stock.  Tagging studies show that fish migrate among these four stocks, and all 
stocks occur within the Russian waters.  All stocks, except the Nemuro stock, have two or more spawning 
areas.  Spawning occurs mainly in areas around northern Japan.  There has been a gradual decline in catch 
from about 1.5 million t in 1980 to about 300,000 t in 2000.  However, total catches in the 1990s were 
moderately stable.  Ocean conditions affect productivity in trends that are approximately decadal, but the 
xiv 
relationship does not match the traditional large-scale decadal indicators.  Strong year classes are important for 
recruitment but the mechanisms that link with strong year classes and environmental conditions remain 
unknown.  Walleye pollock are a moderately long-lived species and produce strong year classes which give 
resiliency to climate change-induced recruitment variation, provided stocks are not overfished. 
 
Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) 
Virtually all chum salmon in Japan are reared in hatcheries and released after a short rearing period following 
hatching.  Catches fluctuated in the recent decade without a trend, averaging about 193,600 t from 1990 to 
2000.  It is only the marine environment that affects productivity as there is no relationship between stock and 
recruitment as exists for wild Pacific salmon since the number of offspring released from hatcheries is kept 
relatively constant at about 2 billion.  Japanese-produced chum salmon spend their first marine year in the 
southern Okhotsk Sea.  In the fall, juveniles move into the subarctic North Pacific where they remain for 3 to 5 
years.  It appears that marine survival is related more to the regional conditions in coastal areas than to the 
PDO or Aleutian Low Pressure Index (ALPI).  
 
Pacific saury (Cololabis saira)     
Pacific saury have a maximum life span of 2 years or less.  Two stocks occur around Japan.  Most catches are 
from the Northwestern Pacific stock off the Pacific coast of Japan.  The other stock is in the Japan Sea.  The 
Northwestern Pacific stock spawns in winter throughout subtropical waters and in spring and autumn in the 
Kuroshio–Oyashio Transition Zone.  Catches have been approximately stable at about 280,000 t since 1980.  
Productivity is related to the ENSO but does not appear to be linked to the PDO.  The clear relationship of 
productivity with sea surface temperature in the Kuroshio and Kuroshio Extension in winter indicates that 
climate-related changes in the ocean will affect Pacific saury production.  Warm surface waters in the 
Kuroshio and subtropical waters are associated with reduced recruitment which will reduce Pacific saury 
abundance. 
 
Common squid (Todarodes pacificus)     
Common squid live approximately 1 year and are abundant throughout the  Japan Sea and coastal–offshore 
waters in the Pacific Ocean.  An autumn and winter spawning stock is recognized, depending on the time egg 
hatching.  Body size and migration patterns also differ.  Both stocks are fished by Korea and China, in addition 
to Japan.  The recent warm temperatures in waters around Japan are favourable for squid productivity which 
increased substantially in the 1990s.  Post-spawning retention of eggs within a midwater layer improves 
productivity.  Common squid and jack mackerel productivity are similar and opposite to the trends observed 
for Japanese sardine.  Common squid abundances are not resilient to greenhouse gas-induced climate change 
as their life span is only 1 year.  If there are more frequent periods of intense Aleutian Lows, there could be 
more frequent periods of reduced abundance. 
 
Neon flying squid (Ommastrephes bartrami)     
Neon flying squid are voracious predators of small fishes and squids, and grow to 60 cm in mantle length in 
about 1 year.  A winter–spring cohort and autumn cohort are recognized on the basis of hatching times, body 
size and migration patterns.  Neon flying squid were the target species of the former driftnet fishery that ended 
in 1992 by international agreement.  A new jig fishery started in the mid-1990s throughout the western and 
central North Pacific Ocean.  Since 1993, Japanese catches ranged from 15,000 t to 85,000 t.  Warmer sea 
surface temperatures may improve production, but there is no apparent relationship to Regime and regime 
shifts.  
 
 
xv 
People’s Republic of China  
 
China has the largest marine capture fisheries in the world, the majority of which are marine fisheries.  The 
major marine fishing areas are the East China Sea, the South China Sea and the Yellow Sea.  Much of the 
catch is reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as species aggregates such as scads which 
include Trachurus japonicus, Decapterus maruadsi, Setipinna taty and Sardinella zunasi.  In recent years, 
species traditionally referred to as bycatch, and discarded at sea by other countries, have been retained and 
used as food in marine aquaculture.  Production from aquaculture first exceeded the wild catch in 1993 and 
seawater aquaculture now is more than 12 million t.  The Yellow Sea is one of the most intensively fished 
areas in the world.  China now catches about 50 species that account for about 3 million t.  Overfishing is 
recognized as a major factor affecting species composition and abundances, but there are also climate-related 
impacts.  The East China Sea and the Yellow Sea share a common climate system.  Sea surface temperatures in 
the Yellow Sea have a decadal pattern.  The 1960s were cool, the 1970s warm, the 1980s cool, and the 1990s 
warm.  Maximum temperatures were recorded in 1998 after which there has been a cooling trend.  In general, 
there has been a warming trend since the mid-1950s.  There is a weak relationship between large-scale climate 
indicators and regional sea surface temperatures as effects over land are considered to be more influential than 
global processes.  Major rivers include the Han, Datung, Yalu, Huanghe, Sheyang and the Yangtze.  The Bohai 
Sea and the shallow waters along the coast in the Yellow Sea are spawning areas for most species distributed 
in the Yellow Sea. 
 
Small yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena polyactis)     
The small yellow croaker is a slow growing species with a maximum age of 23 years.  There are three stocks, 
the northern stock, the Lüsi stock, and the East China Sea stock.  Most fish now mature at age one and are 
smaller in length than in the 1950s to 1980s.  Small yellow croaker in the Yellow and Bohai seas are fished 
mainly by China and Korea.  Catches by China declined to low levels in the 1970s and 1980s, but increased in 
the 1990s to the high levels recorded in the 1950s.  The increase in catch in the 1990s may be related to 
increased productivity although it is difficult to be certain, as the fishery is not regulated.  There was no 
indication of a major environmental change in the Yellow Sea in the 1980s when catches declined to one-sixth 
of those in the 1950s and 1960s.  Despite these declines and high fishing effort, the low spawning abundance 
resulted in a recovery in the 1990s, suggesting that changes in the ocean carrying capacity resulted in the 
restoration of large catches in the 1990s.  There are no studies examining a linkage between the population 
dynamics of small yellow croaker and global warming impacts.  There is evidence of a connection with 
climate, thus it would be expected that changes in production and, perhaps, distribution could occur. 
 
Anchovy (Engraulis japonicus)     
Anchovy are widely distributed in the Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea with at least one 
stock in the East China Sea and one in the Yellow and Bohai seas.  First maturity occurs at age 1 year.  Peak 
spawning is from mid-May to late June, with most fish spawning at 1 to 2 years old.  Maximum life span is 
about 4 years.  A maximum biomass in recent years was 4.2 million t in late 1992, and prior to 1993 it 
appeared stable.  By the mid-1990s the biomass and catch declined rapidly, and by 2001–2002 the biomass had 
been reduced by 90%.  The fishery expanded rapidly in the 1990s, with more than 1 million t caught in 1997 
and 1998.  In 1998 more than 90% of the catch consisted of fish about 1 year old, indicating that the anchovy 
population had almost collapsed.  This is evidence that abundances of anchovy and sardines follow opposite 
trends that are related to ocean conditions.  Currently, the Japanese sardine is in decline, thus it might be 
expected that anchovy would increase if fishing pressure was not excessive.  Similarly, changing climate could 
also affect abundances if there is an opportunity for the spawning stock to respond to changes in ocean 
conditions. 
 
Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus niphonius)    
Spanish mackerel are abundant in the Bohai, Yellow and East China seas.  One stock in the East China Sea 
spawns from April to May, and the other stock spawns in the Bohai and northern Yellow seas from May to 
xvi 
June.  The species matures at age 1 to 2 years.  Catches increased through the 1980s and 1990s and in recent 
years Spanish mackerel have been the largest pelagic fishery in the Yellow and Bohai seas, with about a half 
million t landed.  Distributions are strongly influenced by water temperatures in the three seas.  Currently, the 
fishery is mainly dependent on fish in their first ocean year, thus excessive fishing may have greater impacts 
than those of a changing climate.  There is no information relating climate change to abundance or distribution. 
 
   
Republic of Korea 
 
There are 300 to 400 fish species in the marine waters around Korea of which over 100 species are of 
commercial value.  Recent catches in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea have declined slightly to about 
1 million t from about 1.5 million t in the mid-1980s to mid-1990s.  At the same time, there has been a decline 
in the catch of demersal species and an increase in the catch of pelagic species.  Smaller catches are made in 
the East/Japan Sea.  Overfishing has been a serious threat to the productivity of key species.  The loss of 
estuarine spawning areas due to habitat degradation from land reclamation and pollution also threatens 
productivity. 
 
Changes in sea surface temperatures profoundly affect productivity.  There had been an increasing trend in sea 
surface temperatures in the last 100 years that has accelerated in the last decade.  Decadal-scale and ENSO-
scale variability affect productivity.  The recent warming trend is associated with a decline in cold-water 
species (e.g., walleye pollock) and an increase in warm water species (e.g., squid, jellyfish, mackerel).  Thus, it 
is expected that climate change will affect the productivity and distribution of species important to the Korean 
fisheries. 
 
Species identified in this summary represent about 75% of the catch since 1980.  Most species have a wide 
range around the Korean Peninsula and can be categorized into three fish communities:  a demersal ecosystem 
in the Yellow and East China seas (i.e., small yellow croaker, hairtail); a pelagic ecosystem in the East China 
Sea to East/Japan Sea (i.e., mackerel, squid, anchovy); and a demersal ecosystem in the northern part of the 
East/Japan Sea (i.e., pollock, Pacific cod).  Most species in these categories generally spawn in coastal areas 
during the spring, migrate to the north to feed during the summer, and then return south to the East China Sea 
in the winter. 
 
Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma)     
Walleye pollock are at their southern limits, distributed along the coastal areas of the northern East/Japan Sea.  
They move south from the Russian coast to the coastal areas off Korea in the winter spawning season.  The 
majority of pollock are in northern Korean Peninsula waters.  Accurate catch data are not available, but 
estimates in the 1990s range from 400,000 – 500,000 t.  Catches in Korea declined from a high of 165,000 t in 
1981 to less than 5,000 t in recent years.  The very low catches appear to be a consequence of the warmer 
water in the south.  In addition to the reduced catch, there was a shift in season when pollock were available, 
from November–December in the 1980s to January–March at present.  It is apparent that changes in climate 
that warm the ocean (at the surface and at 50–100 m depth) will result in reduced pollock abundances in the 
southern waters of the Korean Peninsula.  However, there are decadal-scale trends in abundance, and in 
periods of cooler sea surface temperature, juvenile pollock would be expected in waters off Korea. 
 
Chum salmon (Oncorhyncus keta)     
Chum salmon hatcheries were established in 1913 on the northern Korean Peninsula.  In the mid-1980s, Korea 
resumed the enhancement activities of chum salmon using hatcheries.  It is believed that the chum salmon 
released from hatcheries rear in the southern Okhotsk Sea until autumn, then move to the western subarctic 
Pacific.  Returning adult chum salmon are caught in coastal waters between October and November.  Catches 
in 1997 were 553 t but declined to less than 51 t in 2000.  Marine survival is less than 1%.  High spring sea 
surface temperatures appear to be the cause of reduced marine survival, perhaps by affecting growth.  Warmer 
sea surface temperatures in the future would not be expected to be favourable for chum salmon production 
xvii 
from Korea.  Chum salmon production is also related to regimes.  In cooler, more favourable regimes, the fry 
from chum salmon produced in hatcheries have higher marine survival. 
 
Small yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena polyactis)     
Small yellow croaker is an important commercial species captured demersally, mainly in the East China Sea.  
Recent catches are below 10,000 t, with most fish being 1 or 2 years old in the fishery.  Previously, the species 
used to mature at age 5, but recently they seem to be maturing at a younger age.  Cold and variable 
temperatures at 75 m depth reduce productivity.  However, the relationship between productivity and ocean 
conditions is too poorly understood to speculate on the impacts of global warming on this species. 
 
Hairtail (Trichiurus lepturus)     
Hairtail are a popular species for human consumption.  Catches have gradually decreased from about 150,000 t 
in the early 1980s to less than 100,000 t in recent years.  Hairtail migrate between the area off Jeju Island in the 
winter and the central parts of the Yellow Sea in the summer.  Warmer bottom water off Jeju Island in the 
summer is associated with larger catches.  Not enough information is available to speculate on the impacts of 
global warming on this species. 
 
Anchovy (Engraulis japonicus)     
Anchovy catches in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea have increased steadily since 1970 and now are 
approximately 240,000 t.  Anchovy occur primarily in the warm water area of the southern Yellow Sea in the 
winter and migrate to the southern coast of Korea to spawn from April to August.  It appears that the 
distribution of anchovy eggs and larvae in the summer is related to ocean conditions in the eastern waters off 
Korea.  Warm currents that transport eggs into the coastal areas improve productivity.  In Korean waters there 
is no evidence of an alternating trend of anchovy and sardine production.  There is improved larval survival 
and growth when the Tsushima Warm Current is strong near the coast of Korea.  A key to improved 
understanding of global warming impacts will be an improved understanding of the impacts of climate 
warming on the strength of the Kuroshio Current. 
 
Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus)      
The Japanese sardines that are fished by Korea are part of the large population that undergoes large-scale 
fluctuations in abundance.  The most recent fluctuation started in the late 1970s and ended abruptly in the early 
1990s.  Peak catches were about 180,000 t in the mid-1980s.  Current catches are less than 2,000 t.  It is 
recognized that fluctuations in abundance are related to natural changes in the climate and ocean.  During peak 
abundances sardine eggs and larvae are distributed over large areas.  If there are more frequent and intense 
periods of Aleutian Lows as a result of global warming, sardine production may increase, although there will 
still be alternating periods of high and low abundances. 
 
Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus)     
Chub mackerel are distributed from the surface to 300 m in the Yellow and East China seas.  They migrate 
south in the winter to the spawning areas between Jeju Island and Tsushima Island in the East China Sea.  
Chub mackerel are mainly caught by Korea, Japan and China.  Korean catches increased to over 400,000 t in 
the mid-1990s and currently are about 100,000 t.  Recruitment is related to salinity and zooplankton biomass.  
There is clear evidence that climate and regime shifts affect the production of chub mackerel.  More intense 
Aleutian Lows and a positive PDO may have a negative impact on production. 
 
Jack mackerel (Trachurus japonicus)     
Jack mackerel are common in the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea and the southern East/Japan Sea.  Annual 
catches increased in the mid-1980s through to the late 1990s, ranging from about 15,000 to over 40,000 t, and 
in recent years has been about 23,000 t.  Increases in salinity in April, the volume transport of the Kuroshio 
Current, and zooplankton biomass are correlated with increased recruitment in the following year.  The volume 
xviii 
transport of the Kuroshio Current increased after 1977, resulting in salinity increases in the East China Sea.  It 
is proposed that these changes resulted in increased prey for the juvenile jack mackerel in the spawning area.  
The increased production after 1977 also indicated a decadal-scale trend in productivity.  The regime shift in 
1988/89 shifted the habitat of jack mackerel southward decreasing the overlap with chub mackerel. 
 
Filefish (Thamnaconus modestus)     
Filefish productivity increased after the 1976/77 regime shift when the Aleutian Low intensified, resulting in 
increased volume transport of the Kuroshio Current and the Tsushima Warm Current.  Consequently, catches 
increased to between about 200,000 and 330,000 t.  Catches declined abruptly in 1991 after the 1988/89 
regime shift and have remained at levels less than 20,000 t.  If the Aleutian Low intensifies, under a global 
warming scenario, the volume transport of the Kuroshio Current would increase, favouring improved filefish 
productivity. 
 
Pacific saury (Cololabis saira)     
The distribution of Pacific saury is determined by sea surface temperature and salinity, and they can be found 
residing in higher salinity waters in the East/Japan Sea.  Migration occurs within the Tsushima Warm Current 
system.  They spawn twice a year, in the spring and in the autumn.  Annual catches declined sharply from a 
peak of 40,000 t in 1976 to less than 5,000 t until the mid-1990s where they have fluctuated between 5,000 to 
20,000 t in recent years.  After the 1976/77 regime shift there was a delay in the spring bloom and an earlier 
than normal arrival of spawning groups of Pacific saury, causing a reduction in prey abundance for the larvae.  
Overfishing at the same time is believed to have accelerated the rate of decline.  The abundance of Pacific 
saury is related more to ENSO than to the PDO, as the period of more frequent and intense El Niño’s in the 
mid-1990s appeared favourable for Pacific saury production.  This would indicate that a reduction in wind 
intensity, as a result of global warming, would favour Pacific saury production, but more frequent and intense 
Aleutian Lows would lower productivity. 
 
Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis)     
Skipjack tuna range north to 44
o
N latitude off Japan to 37
o
S latitude off Australia.  They are also fished in the 
eastern Pacific from California to Chile.  Skipjack tuna spawn year round.  All-nation catches of this species 
have increased steadily since the mid-1980s, and currently approach 1 million t.  Korean fisheries occur in the 
central western Pacific Ocean and landings increased from about 100,000 t in 1990 to 174,000 t in 2002, 
representing about 20% of the catch of the five major countries competing for them.  There is a relationship 
between ENSO and the distribution of skipjack tuna, and a key to understanding the impacts of global 
warming will be to look at the impacts of global warming on the frequency and intensity of El Niños in 
relation to skipjack tuna. 
 
Common squid (Todarodes pacificus)     
Common squid live for about 1 year.  There are three spawning groups in Korean waters that are distinguished 
by summer, autumn and winter spawning.  Catches in the East/Japan Sea averaged about 50,000 t until the 
early 1990s when they increased rapidly to about 250,000 t.  The rapid increase in common squid abundance in 
the 1990s is related to the increased abundance of euphausiids and amphipods.  Increased winter sea surface 
temperature also is associated with the increased productivity.  If there are more frequent periods of intense 
Aleutian Lows, then the productivity of common squid will decrease.  However, if wind intensity is reduced 
and sea surface temperatures increase, then common squid abundances will rise.

Russia 
 
Catch of marine species in the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) increased from 1980 to 1986, and 
then declined.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, walleye pollock and Pacific sardine accounted for about 80% 
of this total catch but in the 1990s, walleye pollock abundance declined and Pacific sardine catches collapsed.  
However, Pacific herring catches increased from 2.5 to 25% of the total catches.  In the late 1990s, pink 
salmon catch increased relative to the 1980s, representing 9% of the total catch.   
 
Russian scientists recognized for a long time that inter-annual, decadal and long-term variability in the climate 
and ocean are major factors affecting the population dynamics of marine organisms.  Natural short-term and 
long-term climate cycles are important.  For example, 40- to 60-year cycles significantly influence the 
dynamics of fish populations and complicate the interpretation of impacts from greenhouse gas-induced 
climate change.  Observations suggest that there can be interaction among climate cycles that result in cooling 
and warming trends as well as faunal reorganizations within ecosystems.  For example, in recent years in the 
Okhotsk Sea there has been a cooling trend.  The beginning of a cooler climate in the Far East in 1997 
decreased water temperatures and increased ice development.  At about the same time, large zooplankton 
biomass increased.  There was a decline in the biomass of walleye pollock and Japanese sardine, and an 
increase in Pacific herring and some other epipelagic species such as capelin, anchovy and squids.  Major 
demersal species such as cod, flatfishes and skates have also declined. 
 
Major species in the commercial catch off Russia can be placed in two groups.  One group includes Pacific 
salmon, walleye pollock and Japanese sardine whose productivity increases when global temperatures are 
warmer.  Abundances increase when sea surface temperatures are warmer, as indicated by large-scale climate 
indicators such as the positive state of the PDO, larger ALPI, and zonal (westerly) atmospheric circulation.  
The other group of  fishes, which includes Pacific herring, increases in abundance during periods of lower 
global temperatures, weak Aleutian Lows, negative PDO and meridional atmospheric circulation (north–south 
rather than westerly circulation).  It has been proposed that the associated large-scale climate processes have a 
periodicity of approximately 60 years, but this interpretation is based on a relatively short time series of 
information.  It is difficult to forecast future trends in the productivity of individual marine organisms because 
numerous factors interact to regulate recruitment, but it has been possible to forecast combined production in 
large marine ecosystems based on 40- to 60-year climate and ocean environment cycles.  For example, it is 
expected that current levels of combined productivity will last to 2020 when it will begin to increase.  Longer 
term projections are that the 21st century will be warmer than the 20th century and this will favour increased 
fish production.  In general, the impacts of global warming on fish production is not a priority problem in the 
next few decades. 
 
The following nine species represented over 80% of the catch from 1980 to the mid-1990s. 
 
Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha)     
Pink salmon represent about 40% of the biomass and 60% of the numbers of all Pacific salmon landings by all 
countries.  Pink salmon are the most abundant Pacific salmon in Russia.  At present, the odd-year run of pink 
salmon is dominant in eastern Kamchatka while the even-year run is more abundant in the western Kamchatka 
rivers, a behaviour that can be changeable.  Pink salmon also stray more than other Pacific salmon. 
 
Pink salmon catches increased in the 1980s and the 1990s for both even- and odd-year spawners.  The average 
annual catch for odd-year runs was about 128,000 t.  Catches were largest in eastern Kamchatka, eastern 
Sakhalin Island, and the southern Kuril Islands.  There has been a recent increase in the productivity of even-
year stocks.  If this trend continues, all pink salmon catches could increase to the high levels of 1920–1930. 
 
Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta)     
In Kamchatka most chum fry enter the ocean from mid-May to early June and in the northern Okhotsk Sea 
they migrate to sea in late May to early June.  Chum salmon migrate to the southeastern Bering Sea by late 
xx 
November, although if ocean conditions are optimal, they may stay until early winter in the southern Okhotsk 
Sea.  The Bering Sea is the main summer feeding area for chum salmon after they leave the coast.  New 
research shows that chum salmon feed in a range of temperatures from 1.5° to 20°C that is wider than was 
previously thought.  Ocean age 0 fish prefer water colder than 10.8°C, but older fish have been observed in 
warmer water.  Most chum salmon spend three winters in the ocean (age 3+), although they can also do so at 
ages 2 to 6 years old.  
  
The decline in production and catch from the early 1950s to the mid-1970s was reversed in the 1980s, but 
productivity declined again in the 1990s.  The slow recovery in the 1980s relative to other Japanese and North 
American stocks is believed to be related to competition from hatchery-reared chum salmon of Japanese 
origin.  Projections of future productivity trends are proposed to be related to long-term natural climate cycles. 
 
Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) 
Asian sockeye salmon populations can be grouped into early (spring) and late (summer) runs.  Spawning time 
is related to the average time required to incubate eggs in a particular locality:  the higher the water 
temperature, the later the spawning time.  Most sockeye salmon rear in fresh water for at least one year and 
migrate to sea after spending one winter in fresh water or to age 2.  Catches in recent years (22,800 t) were 
close to the historic high catches in the 1920s and 1930s when 14,570 to 39,750 t were landed.  The catch of 
Asian sockeye salmon generally follows the trend of the combined catches of all species of Asian and North 
American Pacific salmon.  These trends occur because of climate regimes, food competition, ecosystem 
rearrangements and fishing.  Climate cycles influence sockeye salmon productivity, especially during the 
winter period in the freshwater spawning areas and in the ocean in the marine feeding areas.  Catches of 
sockeye salmon are larger during periods when the subarctic front is more to the south. 
 
Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) 
Walleye pollock are a valuable commercial species in Russia. Major fisheries are located in the Okhotsk Sea 
and Bering Sea.  In the Okhotsk Sea, walleye pollock are the most abundant commercial fish.  There is an 
extended spawning period ranging from peak periods in March and early April in the western Kamchatka shelf 
through to early June on the eastern side.  Spawning patterns and larval development are related to ocean 
dynamics, particularly to anticyclonic eddies that concentrate eggs and prevent them from being transported 
over large areas.  Most males and females mature at ages 5 and 6 years, respectively.  Annual catches were 
relatively stable, averaging about 1,500,000 t from the mid-1980s through to the 1990s, but catches declined in 
recent years.  There is a relationship between abundance and the 11-year solar cycle and an 8- to10-year cycle 
in atmospheric circulation.  Stronger year classes occur during periods of warming of the Okhotsk Sea when 
there is a close matching of early larval development and food supply. 
 
In the Bering Sea, walleye pollock are the most abundant gadoid fish species.  The population in the western 
Bering Sea is reproductively isolated from the eastern population.  Hydroacoustic estimates in 2002 identified a 
biomass of 8.6 million t in the eastern Bering Sea and 286,000 t in the western Bering Sea.  Most pollock in the 
fishery are 3 to 8 years old.  Catches on the western shelf were relatively stable from 1976 to 1994 at about 
273,000 t per year.  From 1995 to 2002, catches decreased about 3.2 times and abundance remains low.  In 
general, year-class strength is related to climate and ocean conditions during spawning and larval development.  
Long periods of juvenile residence under the ice in winter reduce survival.  The strong inflow of warm Pacific 
Ocean water into the Bering Sea through the Aleutian Islands passes improves the possibility of strong year 
classes. 
 
Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) 
Pacific herring are a widely distributed species in the North Pacific Ocean.  There are a number of 
geographical groups of herring along the Russian coast that differ in their ecology and abundance.  Most 
mature at age 3, live to 8 years, and spawn in the winter through to the early spring in the shallow nearshore 
areas.  Catches are less than the maximum allowable catch, indicating that the fluctuations in abundance are 
related more to climate than to fishing.  It is expected that there will be increased trends in productivity. 
xxi 
Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) 
Pacific saury is a subtropic, epipelagic species that is distributed between Japan and the Kuril Islands in the 
south and the Komandor and Aleutian Islands in the north.  They are common in the Japan Sea and the 
southern Okhotsk Sea.  They reproduce throughout the year with peaks in the winter–spring in the Kuroshio 
Current and in the spring–autumn in the South China and Japan seas.  One-year-old fish constitute most of the 
commercial catch.  Catches increased through the 1980s, reaching a maximum of about 72,600 t in 1990.  
Catches declined in the 1990s to a low of 4,665 t in 1998, then increased to about 51,700 t in 2002.  Pacific 
saury abundance is related to 19-year cycles of lunar activity which  affect the position of frontal zones, current 
meandering and eddy formation within the spawning area.  In both the Pacific Ocean and the Japan Sea, the 
increase in abundance is related to the intensification of the Kuroshio Current and the warming of surface 
waters during the winter.  Conditions that improve the abundance of prey for the larvae also improves saury 
productivity. 
 
Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax)  
Catches of sardine increased in the 1980s, reaching maximum levels in 1989 and 1990.  Catches declined 
quickly beginning in 1991, and there has been virtually no catch since 1994.  Catches in the Russian zone 
occur during the feeding period beginning in April through to June in areas off Primorye and Sakhalin Island, 
and ending in late October–early November.  Five large rapid rises and declines in sardine abundance were 
reported over the past 500 years.  It is proposed that atmospheric processes that are characterized by westerly 
winds produce a warmer climate and are favourable for sardine production that can result in a rapid increase in 
abundance.  Conditions within the entire ecosystem are essential for a rapid increase in abundance.  A 
relationship exists between abundance cycles and the 22-year cycle of solar activity.  It is possible that the next 
rapid increase of sardine abundance will occur between 2010 and 2020 as a consequence of naturally occurring 
planetary processes. 
  
Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) 
Pacific cod are widely distributed along the Pacific Rim from the Yellow Sea to Santa Monica Bay, California.  
They are among the larger demersal species and are highly regarded as a commercial species.  They remain a 
major species in the coastal catch of the Russian EEZ.  Spawning occurs from February to April, with peak 
spawning in March.  Pacific cod prefer to spawn in water temperatures of 1.0–2.5°C and to avoid water 
warmer than 10°C.  Pacific cod are characterized by extreme variability in year-class strength.  Environmental 
factors strongly affect productivity.  However, the relationship between climate, ocean conditions and 
productivity is poorly understood. 
 
Red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) 
There are two populations of red king crab in the Okhotsk Sea.  The western Kamchatka population is the most 
abundant.  Seasonal migrations occur between the offshore areas in the winter and the shelf areas in the spring 
through to the fall when they spawn.  Females retain up to 300,000 fertilized eggs for 11.5 months.  Larvae 
hatch in April–May and settle on the bottom in August.  The largest aggregations of crab larvae are found in 
coastal areas.  Strong year classes occur every 4 to 6–7 years.  The two previous strong year classes occurred 
in 1993 and 1994.  Spawning in cold years produces low yields as larvae hatch in areas less suitable for 
survival.  In warmer years, the larvae hatch in the warmer coastal waters where they are transported into the 
eastern Shelikov Bay which is favourable for growth.  Abnormal ocean conditions in 1998 caused a number of 
apparently permanent changes in the distribution and population dynamics of bottom organisms.  Cooling of 
the western Kamchatka near-bottom water caused crabs to change their migration behaviour, resulting in sharp 
declines in abundance in the north.

United States of America – Alaska Region 
 
There are three main ecosystems in the Alaska region whose productivity are affected by their locations, 
topography and ocean circulation.  The Gulf of Alaska, with its narrow continental shelves and deep slopes 
that are exposed to the North Pacific Ocean, has its productivity mostly affected by large seasonal variations in 
coastal circulation.  The Bering Sea, a semi-enclosed high-latitude sea which has a broad continental shelf that 
supports high biological productivity, is unique in its seasonal coverage of ice and ocean circulation with 
passage of North Pacific water through the passes of Aleutian Islands.  The Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea are 
situated between two large continents that greatly determine their atmospheric circulations. Winter circulations 
are characterized by decadal-scale trends in the Aleutian Lows that link climate to productivity in both regions.  
The Arctic region off northern Alaska where the Chukchi Sea is ice bound virtually year round is low in 
biological production.  There are no major commercial fisheries in the Arctic, thus the focus of this report is 
the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska.  It is recognized, however, the changes of global warming will be 
greatest in the Arctic. 
 
The impacts of global warming on fish production will be difficult to separate from natural and fishing effects.  
Natural, decadal-scale regimes are now recognized as major influences on fish production and catch.  The 
regime shift in 1976/77 was particularly influential in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska.  Large-scale indices 
of climate trends are useful indicators of effects on the composition and structure of ecosystems.  However, no 
single index can adequately capture the processes that affect the dynamics of marine ecosystems.  This is 
particularly relevant for physical–biological coupling which is known to be non-linear.  One interpretation of 
the impacts of global warming is the secular warming of the atmosphere over the North Pacific Ocean that 
would decrease the meridional (north–south) thermal gradient, decreasing winter storm intensity and shifting 
the storm track northward.  An associated increase in humidity off the Gulf of Alaska would increase coastal 
precipitation.  The northward movements of the average line of zero wind stress curl that separated the 
subarctic and subtropical gyres would weaken the eastward flowing current, the West Wind Drift, shifting the 
bifurcation of the Alaska and Californian Currents northward. 
 
Global warming could decrease winter storm intensity in the Gulf of Alaska, resulting in less upwelling, a 
shallowing and warming of the surface mixed layer characteristic of increased stratification.  Predicted 
increased precipitation along the Gulf of Alaska would increase freshwater runoff, further increasing 
stratification of the surface waters.  The timing of the spring bloom could be earlier, but the effect on nutrient 
concentrations over the shelf is not known as the possible changes would counteract each other. 
 
Effects of global warming should be greater in the Bering Sea than in the Gulf of Alaska. Decreases in major 
current systems may occur, but competing effects make it difficult to forecast specific changes.  Ice extent, ice 
thickness and brine rejection are expected to decrease.  There will be increased freshwater runoff resulting 
from snow and ice melt and increased precipitation.  Significant changes are expected, but the net effect on the 
ecosystem is not clear at this time.  Although the Arctic is not included in this report it is important to 
recognize that significant changes are expected over the next 50 years.  The northern ice cap is warming at 
twice the global rate.  The extent of ice in the Arctic may be smaller by about 50% by 2100.  One climate 
model predicts that by 2070, the Arctic may no longer have ice in the summer.  Snow and ice reflect 80 to 90% 
of solar radiation back into space.  As snow and ice disappear, more heat is absorbed by land.  The very dry air 
in the Arctic also results in more heat being produced as less is used to evaporate the humidity.  All changes 
are expected to have impacts on the ecosystems, including the marine fish community.  One expected change 
is that Pacific salmon will stray more into the Arctic and some species may establish new runs in fresh water. 
 
The effects of global warming are considered for the following key species in the Alaska marine fisheries.  
 
Pacific salmon  
Pink salmon are the most abundant species of Pacific salmon in Alaska, accounting for 40 to 70% of the 
annual catch.  They comprised 58% of the average annual commercial catch of Pacific salmon in Alaska from 
xxiii 
1970 to 2003.  In Bristol Bay and western Alaska, pink salmon are at the northern limit of their range and are 
dominated by even-year runs. 
 
Sockeye salmon are the second most abundant species in the Alaskan catch, accounting for about 27% of the 
annual catch in recent years.  The largest fisheries occur in Bristol Bay, Cook Inlet, the Alaska Peninsula–
Aleutian Islands and Kodiak regions.  From 1992 to 1996, an average of 36.5 million sockeye salmon were 
caught in the Bristol Bay fishery.  In recent years the abundances have declined substantially below previous 
decadal averages.  The causes of the decline have not been determined but are believed to be related to changes 
in climate. 
 
Chum salmon catches accounted for an average of 10% of all salmon catches from 1970 to 2003.  Catches 
began to increase in the mid-1990s, with a record catch of 24.3 million fish in 2000.  Hatcheries in the south-
eastern region produce a significant percentage of the catch.  However, in western Alaska chum salmon 
catches are well below long-term averages. 
 
Coho and chinook salmon are popular species in the recreational fisheries.  Coho catches increased from the 
late 1970s through to the mid-1990s and then declined slightly to 4.1 million fish in 2003.  Chinook salmon 
catches have fluctuated between 300,000 and 400,000 fish in the past two decades, but tended to be stable, 
except in the late 1990s. 
 
It is possible that the negative impacts of global warming would be more apparent to salmon production in 
fresh water that in the ocean.  Changing patterns of river flows would affect egg survival and the timing of 
smolt migration into the ocean.  Recent ocean conditions have contributed to greatly improve Pacific salmon 
productivity, indicating that climate-related changes in the ocean also have important impacts on production, 
perhaps not negatively.  However, the potential impacts of global warming on Pacific salmon production are 
generally not known. 
 
Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) 
Pacific herring are fished commercially mainly in Prince William Sound, Southeast Alaska, and the Togiak 
district.  In Prince William Sound there was strong recruitment of age 3 fish in the mid-1980s.  The average 
biomass from 1980 to 1992 was 84,000 t.  In 1993, the stock collapsed and the biomass has remained at less 
than one half of the previous levels.  In Southeast Alaska, herring biomass fluctuated without trend and 
without decadal-scale variability associated with standard regimes.  Herring in the Togiak region exhibited a 
reduction in abundance in the 1980s that has remained low.  The mode of climate variability that most affects 
recruitment is not clear, but the time of influence may be during the larval stage.  The variability in recruitment 
makes it difficult to determine how climate change is related to production, but it may be prudent to expect the 
unexpected. 
 
Alaska Groundfish Fisheries   
There is decadal-scale variability in the dynamics of the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem as indicated by the changes 
that occurred after the 1976/77 regime shift.  In general, there was a warming trend that was favorable for 
species such as Pacific salmon, Pacific cod and flatfishes (especially Pacific halibut and virtually all of the 
flatfish species, except for deep-water Greenland turbot in the Bering Sea slope region), Pacific ocean perch 
and other rockfish species, but was unfavorable for crustacean species such as shrimp and crab.  Ecosystem 
responses were less dynamic after the 1989 and 1998 shifts, indicating that climate changes are important, but 
there is considerable variability between the linkages of these climate shifts and the recruitment responses of 
the key commercially important species.  The main species of groundfish in the fishery are walleye pollock, 
Pacific cod, yellowfin sole, northern rock sole, Pacific ocean perch, Atka mackerel, arrowtooth flounder, and 
sablefish.  The dominant species in the catches in the Bering Sea were walleye pollock (73%), Pacific cod 
(11%), yellowfin sole (4%), northern rock sole (3%), Atka mackerel (3%) and the rest were less than 1% each.  
The average catch from 2002–2004 was about 1.9 million t from an exploitable biomass of about 18 million t.  
In the Gulf of Alaska, recent catches averaged 120,000 t from an exploitable biomass of 5.2 million t.  The 
xxiv 
biomass is dominated by arrowtooth flounder representing 50% of all the groundfish biomass.  Walleye 
pollock are the major commercial catch representing 36% of the landings, compared to 25% for Pacific cod, 
14% for flatfishes, 13% for rock fishes, and 8% for sablefish.  Catches are at near historic high levels, even 
though they generally are below acceptable levels.  Strict catch limits are placed on all species, including 
bycatch, to reduce the unintended catch of other species.  Walleye pollock, Pacific cod, Atka mackerel and 
sablefish had similar trends in production, but not on a scale of the standard regimes.  However, flatfish and 
rockfish production corresponded to a regime-scale pattern.   
 
Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) 
Walleye pollock are the key commercial species in the Alaskan fishery.  There are three main stocks in the 
Bering Sea–Aleutian Islands (BSAI) region, the eastern Bering Sea stock, the Aleutian Basin stock and the 
Aleutian Island stock.  There are two main stocks in the Gulf of Alaska.  There are a number of spawning areas 
in the BSAI, within the major spawning areas over the shelf.  Pollock that spawn in the open ocean have their 
eggs and larvae carried by currents over a wide geographical area, beginning in late February.    Recruitment is 
largely determined by the end of the larval period.  In general, survival is diminished when larval fish are 
transported offshore, and increased if the eggs and larvae are carried towards the shelf where food is more 
plentiful.  It is generally agreed that the frequency of occurrence of strong year classes determines the 
population biomass.  There is no indication that recruitment is related to regimes and regime shifts although 
there was a major increase in biomass in the 1980s following strong recruitment in the late 1970s.  The 
increased production may be a result of warmer temperatures, reduced ice cover at spawning times and 
increased plankton production for larval fish.  In contrast, walleye pollock biomass in the Gulf of Alaska 
declined from a maximum in 1982 through to the present.  Occasional strong year classes occurred about every 
four years in the 1980s and 1990s which may be related more to ENSO conditions than decadal-scale 
variability.  There is an improved understanding of the mechanisms that cause variation in recruitment, but 
there are still a number of hypotheses that need to be resolved.  The matching of prey with larval feeding is the 
major consideration, but cannibalism and distributional changes resulting from ocean temperature changes are 
also considered important.  An important consideration is that the variability in recruitment is climate related.  
The impact of global warming would be related to changes in currents that transport eggs and larval pollock.  
Until more is known about the changes in currents, it will be difficult to determine the impacts of a warming 
climate on walleye pollock productivity. 
 
Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis)  
The center of Pacific halibut abundance along the west coast of North America is the central Gulf of Alaska.  
They begin to mature at age 8 and about 50% are mature by age 11.  Spawning occurs from November to 
March in the deeper waters near the edge of the continental shelf off Alaska.  Eggs and larval fish drift 
westward and northward for 6 to 7 months after spawning.  It is at this stage that climate and ocean conditions 
determine the strength of the year class.  The commercial fishery is shared with Canada and managed by the 
International Pacific Halibut Commission.  Catches increased in the 1980s and in recent years have been at 
historic high levels of about 40,000 t.  Climate variability affects productivity and distribution of halibut.  
There also have been major changes in trends in weight that are not readily associated with stock size.  Female 
halibut at age 11 in 1995 were roughly half the weight they were in 1980.  Recruitment is primarily related to 
climate regimes as indicated by the PDO.  Stock size explains very little of the variability in recruitment.  
Recruitment into the Alaskan fisheries improved relative to other areas during the positive phase of the PDO.  
Global warming impacts that affect the ecological and oceanographic conditions in the near surface waters 
during the egg and larval fish period will have the greatest impacts on production.  However, the impacts on 
ocean circulation in the surface waters along the shelf edge are not well understood. 
 
Crab 
Three king crab species, red, blue and golden brown, and two Tanner crab species, Tanner and snow, are major 
fisheries off Alaska.  Recent averages yields for king (8,130 t), snow (13,038 t), and Tanner (712 t) crabs are 
well below the long-term averages.  Catches of crabs are restricted by regulation to large male crabs.  Current 
crab abundances are low. Abundances of most red king crab populations have been low since the mid-1980s.  
xxv 
Blue king crab abundances are very low, resulting in an overfished designation in the Bering Sea.  The Eastern 
Bering Sea Tanner crab population declined in the early 1990s.  The fishery has been closed since 1996, with 
the exception of a small fishery near the Pribilof Islands in recent years.  Eastern Bering Sea snow crabs are 
also in low abundance. 
 
Fluctuations in crab recruitment at the egg and larval stage are the causes of the changes in abundance.  There 
is some evidence that intense Aleutian Lows reduce larval survival as preferred diatom species are less 
available.  However, there is poor correlation in recruitment patterns among stocks, indicating that the 
relationship with climate is complex.  With no common explanation for all stock changes, it is difficult to 
predict how ocean warming would affect future crab recruitment, particularly when crab larvae and young 
crabs are subject to predation and other ecosystem interactions.  There have been major shifts in the spatial 
distribution of Bering Sea red king crab in the last three decades.  Shifts in distributions seem to be related to 
warmer near bottom temperatures.  These shifts may affect the subsequent distribution patterns of eggs and 
larvae.  Understanding the impacts of global warming requires a better understanding of the mechanisms that 
affect larval survival as well as an understanding of changes in near bottom temperatures and new current 
patterns. 
 
Pandalid shrimp  
Shrimp (Pandulus and Pandalopsis spp.) landings in Alaska consist of five species, with the northern shrimp 
being the most important.  Shrimp landings increased to 58,000 t in 1976 and declined rapidly to 2000 t in 
1984 where they have remained at these low levels.  The synchrony in the decline is an indication that changes 
in the ocean caused the decline.  In fact, rapid pandalid shrimp population changes are one of the early 
indicators that the structure of a community is changing.  Sustained future strong recruitment will require a 
shift to colder ocean conditions which could occur during a negative phase of the PDO.

Foreword 
 
 
This report summarizes the interpretations of the impacts of climate and climate change on the important 
marine species in the commercial fisheries of Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United States.  
Leading experts in these six PICES member countries used published literature as well as their own 
interpretations to assess the impact of climate and climate change on the dynamics of the key commercial 
species and their associated marine fisheries.  It has been relatively recently that climate has been recognized 
as a significant factor in the regulation of abundance trends of key species in world marine fisheries.  Thus, the 
literature that is available to evaluate future climate impacts is sparse.  Adding to the complexity of forecasting 
impacts is the uncertainty related to regional climate-induced changes in the ocean habitats and the relatively 
poor understanding of the natural history of many species. 
 
The Climate Change and Carrying Capacity (CCCC) Program was the principal activity of PICES since the 
Second Annual Meeting of the Organization in 1993.  The two major themes of the CCCC Program were the 
estimation of the carrying capacity of higher trophic levels and the determination of how changes in ocean 
conditions affect the productivity of key fish species in the subarctic Pacific.  The highly relevant and 
challenging goal of discovering how to forecast the impacts of climate change on the productivity of key fish 
species and their prey was set.  During the 1990s, PICES established expert teams to focus on understanding 
the ecosystem impacts of climate change.  Symposia, workshops and meetings improved scientific 
understanding around the North Pacific through timely and effective communication within the ocean science 
community.  Working Group 16 on Climate Change, Shifts in Fish Production, and Fisheries Management 
was part of the effort, accepting the challenge of reporting the impacts of climate change on the key species 
and their fisheries in the countries that form PICES. 
 
There is informed speculation in this report that highlights what might happen to major fisheries in the future.  
There also are differences in opinion.  However, this international summary should be seen as a first attempt to 
report what is known about the impact of climate and climate change on the major fisheries in the northern 
North Pacific.  It is a benchmark that can be cited and used to encourage the formation of other research teams.  
Not all key species or major areas were addressed by all countries, but there is an accumulation of material that 
provides evidence of large-scale associations with climate.  An effort was made to standardize the reporting 
among countries; however, the reader will note that structural and editorial differences occur.  Also, the issues 
were seen differently among the scientists involved in the preparation of the report.  These differences were to 
be expected as the approaches to fisheries management differ among the six countries.   The Synopsis attempts 
to tie everything together by emphasizing how the major species and their fisheries may be related to large-
scale climate events.  This section is the interpretation of the two authors and not necessarily the view of all 
authors.  I hope that it is the Synopsis that leads to the next report which will bring experts together to search 
for common mechanisms and linkages.  Success in this second phase could lead to the third phase, which 
would connect information to global climate change models and natural physical cycles. 
 
In the future, there needs to be better understanding of the biology, ecology and population dynamics of the 
key species in the major fisheries in the North Pacific.  An improved understanding of the natural history of the 
major species will improve forecasts and may reduce the number of models used to make decisions.  Readers 
of this report will be able to appreciate the amount of work that is involved to develop forecast models that 
reliably identify the impacts of future climates.  It is clear from the experience of this Working Group that 
forecasting the impacts of a changing climate on the key fisheries in the North Pacific will require 
commitments by all countries to support coordinated and focused research by teams of experts.

Abstract 
 
 
This is the report of the PICES Fishery Science Committee Working Group  on Climate Change, Shifts in Fish 
Production, and Fisheries Management (WG 16).  There is general agreement that climate change strongly 
affects the production of many species around the North Pacific and that the impact of greenhouse gas-induced 
changes on key species and their fisheries are poorly understood.  Some PICES member countries consider 
global warming effects on fish populations to be less important than fishing impacts and natural climate cycles. 
 
The productivity of key species in the fisheries off Canada is generally recognized to be related to climate and 
climate change.  Regime-scale changes in climate variability affect many important fisheries.  If global 
warming results in more frequent and more intense Aleutian Lows, as might be indicated by climate change 
trends since the 1970s, then the productivity of the many species that had increased marine survival in the 
1980s may improve.  However, species at the southern limits of their distributions may decline even if there is 
an intensification of the Aleutian Low. 
 
A major influence on fish productivity in the Japanese coastal and offshore fisheries is the structure and 
dynamics of the subarctic Oyashio current, the subtropical Kuroshio and Tsushima currents, and the transition 
area between the Oyashio and the Kuroshio.   Climate and ocean conditions are known to have major impacts 
on the abundance of key species in the Japanese commercial fisheries.  If winds are reduced by future warming 
of the ocean, the primary production in the seas around Japan may also decrease because of reduced vertical 
ocean mixing in the winter.  In general, however, the impacts of climate and ocean changes vary among areas 
and species, and are poorly understood, but it is clear that climate and ocean conditions are major influences in 
the productivity of fishes in the seas around Japan.  Thus, it is predicted that global warming-induced changes 
will affect future fisheries. 
 
The People’s Republic of China has the largest marine fisheries in the world.  It also has the largest sea water 
aquaculture production that exceeds their wild catch.  Climate and ocean conditions are known to affect 
production and distribution, but fishing is considered to be the major factor influencing the population 
dynamics of key commercial species.  There are distinct patterns in ocean temperatures that appear to be a 
result of regional rather than global influences. 
    
Catches of marine species by the Republic of Korea (most commercially important species range around the 
Korean Peninsula) were relatively stable from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s and have declined slightly in 
recent years.  Overfishing has been, and continues to be, a serious threat to productivity, resulting in 
populations of smaller, very young individuals.  Climate-related ocean changes also profoundly affect 
productivity.  It is recognized that future climate change will have important impacts on productivity which 
will require reducing the effects of overfishing.  However, the impacts of global warming are speculative. 
 
Climate and ocean conditions have traditionally been a major consideration in Pacific fisheries science in 
Russia.  Natural cycles in atmospheric circulation, sea surface temperatures, lunar and solar cycles are all 
associated with the aggregate productivity of marine ecosystems.  In particular, it appears that there is a natural 
50- to 60-year periodicity that is proposed to continue to influence fish productivity in the 21st century.  
Russian fisheries scientists assess global warming impacts relative to these natural cycles.  Because these 
cycles are so influential on physical and biological processes in the ocean, global warming impacts are not 
considered as the first priority problem, at least for the next few decades, especially because the Far Eastern 
seas have cooled in recent years. 
 
2 
There is convincing evidence that natural climate-related changes strongly affect the dynamics of key 
commercial species in the United States fisheries off Alaska.  A major change in ecosystem dynamics and 
species composition occurred after the 1977 regime shift, indicating the importance of large-scale climate 
changes that can be relatively fast.  It is generally agreed that future climate change will alter the ecological 
dynamics of marine ecosystems but the mechanisms that regulate recruitment are so poorly understood that it 
is difficult to do more than speculate on the impacts of global warming.

Synopsis 
R.J. Beamish and D. Noakes

This study identified climate and ocean conditions as major factors affecting the dynamics of key species in the 
fisheries of Canada, Japan, People’s Republic of China, Republic of Korea, Russia and the United States of 
America.  Trends in production or catch were evident, possibly indicating that the environmental effects were 
not random.  However, the scale of climate influence varied among areas and species.   
 
Pacific Salmon 
 
The general trend in Pacific salmon production was similar for North American and Asian populations.  
Increased production started in the late 1970s, reaching historic high catches in 1995 (Fig. 1).  Catches 
declined slightly but were the second highest in history in 2003.  In both the eastern and western Pacific, 
salmon catches generally increased substantially after the regime shift in 1977.  Pink salmon dominate the 
Russian catch, which increased throughout the late 1980s and into the 1990s.  Japan produces the largest 
number of chum salmon, virtually all in hatcheries, eliminating climate impacts in fresh water.  However, it is 
recognized that juvenile chum salmon produced in Japan rear in the Okhotsk Sea, Bering Sea and Gulf of 
Alaska in the winter.  Thus, ocean conditions throughout the subarctic Pacific influence returns through marine 
survival.  The mechanisms responsible for the increases in salmon abundance, beginning in the late 1970s, are 
not clear as total salmon production relates to conditions in fresh water, the ocean, as well as to hatchery 
production.  Adding to the complexity is the relative absence of stock-specific catch and escapement 
measurements.  Despite these difficulties, there is evidence that the effects of climate and ocean conditions on 
salmon production are not random.  For example, in a recent study (Beamish et al., 2004), the aggregate 
production of all sockeye salmon in the Fraser River in Canada shows a clear trend in the residuals from a 
Ricker curve fit to stock and recruitment data.  The change in the trends in this important Canadian population 
was consistent with a regime scale of variability.  Another example is the increased pink salmon production in 
Russia that was associated with a warmer ocean and with trends in atmospheric circulation.  If the favourable 
conditions persist, pink salmon catches may continue to increase, reaching the high levels of the 1920s 
(Radchenko, 1998).  
 
Although there was agreement within the PICES Working Group on Climate Change, Shifts in Fish 
Production, and Fisheries Management that climate was an important factor affecting salmon population 
dynamics, it was not possible to determine how future climate scenarios would affect total and regional salmon 
production.  Various levels of speculation exist, but the only firm conclusion is that climate will continue to be 
a major factor affecting salmon production in a non-random manner.  If dependable forecasts of climate 
impacts are important in management, it is clear that more information is needed about the mechanisms that 
limit their freshwater and marine production.  It is also important to recognize that hatcheries provide a method 
of mitigating unfavourable conditions in fresh water and, to some extent, allow for a better matching of the 
time of entry into the ocean and prey availability.

Other Important Species 
 
In the eastern Pacific, important fisheries exist for walleye pollock, Pacific cod, Pacific hake, Pacific herring, 
Pacific halibut, sablefish, and Pacific ocean perch.  In the western Pacific, the key species in the fisheries are 
walleye pollock, Japanese sardine, anchovy, Pacific herring, chub mackerel, jack mackerel, Pacific saury, 
small yellow croaker and hairtail.  In general, fisheries for all these species represented about 57.3% of the 
total catch in the northern North Pacific in the 1990s (FAO, 2006).   
 
Walleye pollock support the largest fishery in the northern North Pacific, representing 23% of all recent fish 
catches, including Pacific salmon.  It is the world’s largest fishery, accounting for 8% of all marine fish catches 
in the 1990s.   It is the dominant fish in the Bering Sea and Okhotsk Sea.  There are trends in its abundance 
that are approximately decadal, indicating that trends in climate and ocean conditions affect recruitment.  In 
the Bering Sea, abundances increased in the mid-1980s and then decreased to the mid-1990s.  Abundances 
have decreased recently in the eastern Bering Sea and western Bering Sea.  There is a trend in production but 
the timing of fluctuations in the Bering Sea and Okhotsk Sea has not been found to correspond to the generally 
accepted years when regimes have shifted (1977, 1989 and 1998).  This may indicate that other trends in 
forcing factors are important, or that the information used to date to detect an association is incomplete.  In the 
Okhotsk Sea, periods of warmer water appear to provide more prey for the larval stages of pollock, improving 
recruitment.  This explanation is similar to the proposal of Hunt et al. (2002) that cold regimes in the Bering 
Sea reduce prey abundance for larval pollock, resulting in trends of reduced pollock abundance.  There is a 
similarity in trends of recruitment between walleye pollock and Pacific cod in the eastern Bering Sea and Gulf 
of Alaska, indicating that common factors in the ocean are synchronously affecting their production.  It would 
appear that the basic biological mechanisms linking recruitment and environmental factors are similar 
throughout their distribution.  However, the mechanisms remain to be identified.  It is clear that there are 
trends in abundance that are linked to trends in the ocean which would be expected to be linked to trends in 
climate.  Considering the importance of pollock, it would seem logical that an international team of researchers 
should be formed to coordinate the research and analyses needed to establish the linkages between climate 
trends and walleye pollock recruitment.  This is also a necessary step towards understanding the impacts of 
future changes in climate trends. 
 
Pacific cod represented approximately 6% of the total groundfish catch in the northern North Pacific in the 
1990s.  In 2002–2004, this species accounted for 11% of the United States groundfish catch in the Bering Sea 
and 25% in the Gulf of Alaska.  These catches were the second highest of all species.  In Russia, Pacific cod 
traditionally have been the fourth highest species in the catch, including Pacific salmon.  It is interesting that 
5 
the total catch of Pacific cod from 2002 to 2004, as reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 
of the United Nations, is approximately 40% of the total catch of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua).  Despite the 
importance of Pacific cod, there was surprisingly little information about the factors affecting recruitment.  
Canada reported that recruitment was related to ocean conditions.  Russia identified strong fluctuations in year-
class strength but had difficulty linking these fluctuations to environmental factors.  The United States noted 
that Pacific cod and walleye pollock have similar recruit per spawner trends in the Bering Sea and Gulf of 
Alaska, suggesting that there is a common mechanism linking their productivities.  Pacific cod population 
dynamics need more attention, particularly if their dynamics are a good index of changing ecosystem states, as 
suggested by Canada.   
 
Pacific herring are another commercially important species around the rim of the northern North Pacific.  
Canada, the United States, Russia and China identified Pacific herring as a major species in their fisheries.  
Pacific herring are also a key prey for a number of other species, including marine mammals.  There was 
consensus that abundance trends occurred, but perhaps not on a decadal scale.  Stock and recruitment 
relationships were unclear, but environmental conditions appeared to be the critical factor influencing 
recruitment.  Temperature generally provided a useful index of recruitment patterns.  For example, herring 
populations off the Russian coast were large during periods of weak Aleutian Lows and cooler ocean 
temperatures.  In general, the pattern of trends in herring abundance was opposite to abundance trends for 
walleye pollock and Pacific sardine and also differed from other species, such as Pacific cod and Pacific 
salmon.  Canada and China identified relationships between herring and the Southern Oscillation which may 
also be related to temperature impacts on recruitment.  It is important to determine how temperature acts to 
affect recruitment, as warm temperatures were favourable for one population and unfavourable for another 
population off Canada.  Both prey abundance and predator impacts appear important, suggesting a wasp-waist 
type of population dynamics.  There is no question that excessive fishing can reduce recruitment by depleting 
spawning stocks, but there is equal certainty that populations can increase quickly.  The general conclusion is 
that low frequency variability in ocean and climate conditions may regulate recruitment of Pacific herring.  
Unfortunately, decades of research have failed to clearly identify the mechanisms involved.  Thus, any 
forecasts of global warming impacts on Pacific herring remain as educated speculations.  As recommended for 
walleye pollock, it would seem to be timely for an international group of experts to meet in order to determine 
what information is needed to be able to assess the impacts of global warming on Pacific herring.   
 
Fisheries for Pacific hake (also referred to as Pacific whiting) are the largest of all fisheries off Canada and off 
the states of Washington, Oregon and California.  The United States did not include fisheries off the coasts of 
these states in their report, but Canada reported on this coastwide fishery and on a population of Pacific hake in 
the Strait of Georgia.  In the Strait of Georgia, a general warming trend appears to be favourable for Pacific 
hake production.  However, other changes, such as a reduction of predators, may have contributed to the 
current large abundances.  The offshore population of Pacific hake has a pattern of recruitment that remains to 
be understood.  A number of studies and papers have attempted to unravel the linkages regulating recruitment, 
but to date, these linkages remain vague.  Forecasting future trends in abundance will require a better 
understanding of mechanisms regulating production if long-term forecasts are to be useful in management. 
 
Pacific halibut generally have trends in production that follow a decadal-scale variability that matches the 
standard regime periods marked by regime-shift years in 1977, 1989 and 1998.  The assessment of Pacific halibut 
was perhaps the first to incorporate the regime scale of variability.  Pacific halibut are at the top of the food chain; 
they are large fish and their abundance is currently at historic high levels (Clark and Hare, 2002).  The changes in 
abundance trends appear independent of stock size (Clark and Hare, 2002), but there is a major reduction in 
growth.  The increase in abundance from 1980 to 1995 was associated with about a 50% reduction in the size of 
mature female halibut.  The impacts of climate and ocean conditions on survival are believed to occur in the near 
surface waters when larval halibut are being transported northward.  The linkages remain to be discovered. 
 
Owing to high prices, sablefish are an extremely valuable species in the Pacific coast fisheries of Canada and 
the United States.  It is known from Canadian studies that sablefish have decadal-scale trends in recruitment 
that change near the recognized time of regime shifts. It is also known that there can be a coast-wide 
6 
synchrony in strong year-class production.  Periods of above average recruitment occur when a regime is 
characterized by intense Aleutian Lows.  A recruit per spawner analysis of sablefish in the Bering Sea and Gulf 
of Alaska detected trends in recruitment and a shift about 1976–1977, but not the same pattern observed by the 
Canadian study.  Strong year classes are a major factor in recruitment, occurring when there are abundant 
copepod nauplii at the time larval sablefish begin to feed.  Understanding how global warming will affect 
sablefish production, therefore, may require an understanding of how climate and ocean conditions affect the 
production and timing of production of copepods.  Sablefish are long-lived, with a maximum age of 113 years, 
and this may tend to buffer the affects of climate change.  Long-lived species are able to adapt to prolonged 
periods of poor recruitment as long as they are not overfished.  This may mean that fishing strategies for 
sablefish need to incorporate the importance of the age structure in a population (Beamish et al., 2006). 
 
Pacific ocean perch are the dominant species in the catches of a number of species of rockfish.  There is a 
tendency to think that because the 20+ species that are fished are all called rockfish, that there are common 
mechanisms regulating their productivity.  While there may be some validity in this assumption, it would be 
wise to determine the extent of the similarities before assuming common impacts of climate.  Pacific ocean 
perch in the Canadian and United States fisheries showed a decadal-scale variability in productivity that 
changed around the regime shift years of 1977 and possibly 1989.  Pacific ocean perch are long-lived, with 
maximum age of about 100 years, and this may mask the effects of climate change.  The period from 1977 to 
1988 appeared favourable for recruitment.  Thus, periods of intense Aleutian Lows may increase abundances, 
provided that the species are not overfished during periods of poor recruitment.   
 
It is important to recognize that fish in the major fisheries of China, Japan and Korea have much shorter life 
spans than many of the species off the coasts of Canada and the United States.  Off Canada’s coast, for 
example, Beamish et al. (2006) reported that 58% of the 59 species with fisheries of ≥ 1 ton had life spans 
greater than 30 years.  This is important because it is believed that longevity reflects an evolved response to the 
modes of climate and ocean variability that affect recruitment. 
 
Sardine and anchovy populations are well recognized as responding synchronously and rapidly to changes in 
their ocean environment throughout the North and South Pacific oceans (Kawasaki, 1983).  The cycles of 
abundance alternate (Chavez et al., 2003) in response to large-scale, rather than regional climate changes.  
Fishing is not the factor that drives abundance, except that fishing may affect the rate of increase or decline.  In 
the North and South Pacific, the largest total sardine catch in 1985 was 18% of the total world catch of all 
marine fish.  World supplies of fish meal and fish oil depend on this catch, which is of economic value to 
regional fisheries.  Thus, it is important to be able to understand how climate can simultaneously and rapidly 
cause massive increases and decreases in abundance.  It is known that periods of intense Aleutian Lows are 
favourable for Japanese sardine production and unfavourable for anchovy production.  The shifts in trends 
occur about the time of recognized regime shifts, indicating that the winter wind intensity and atmospheric 
circulation patterns are important.  Russian scientists report that the regime-related shift to zonal winds is 
associated with the rapid increase of sardines.  They also find close associations between productivity trends 
and the 22-year solar activity cycle.   
 
Pacific saury are a sub-tropical species that have accounted for total catches in the western Pacific ranging 
from 163,000 t in 1970 to 491,000 t in 1973.  Catches declined in the 1980s and increased again to 436,000 t in 
1990.  This was followed by another decline to 181,000 t in 1998.   In 2003, catches increased to 446,000 t.  
Pacific saury have a productivity pattern that indicates an association with climate cycles.  Russian scientists 
propose that trends in abundance are related to lunar cycles.  Others found associations with the El Niño–
Southern Oscillation (ENSO), reporting that improved abundances were associated with the frequent El Niños 
in the mid-1990s.  It also appears that intense Aleutian Lows associated with a positive Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation (PDO) result in reduced abundances.  Thus, there may be a relationship with climate, especially 
winter climate, but the mechanisms linking climate to production are not known. 
 
Species associated with the Korean and Chinese fisheries are difficult to study because of their history of 
intense fishing pressure.  Nevertheless, there is evidence that climate and climate shifts have important impacts 
7 
on the productivity of chub mackerel and jack mackerel.  Jack mackerel productivity is negatively related to 
the PDO.  A positive PDO was associated with reduced abundances in the 1980s and a negative PDO with 
increases in the 1990s.  This relationship with the PDO appears to be a function of the southern limit of the 
Oyashio Current which is also negatively related to the PDO. 
 
Chub mackerel abundance was shown to be related to climate and climate shifts.  In general, a positive PDO 
and intense Aleutian Lows are associated with reduced productivity, as evidenced by the reduced abundance 
after the 1977 regime shift.  Little is understood about the mechanisms regulating the production of small 
yellow croaker and hairtail.  It is known that anomalously warm bottom temperatures are associated with 
improved production. 
 
Red king crab have supported valuable fisheries in the eastern and western Pacific and populations may be 
categorized as heavily fished.  Strong year classes are important to maintain these populations.  Off Alaska, all 
strong year classes occurred before the 1977 regime shift, when the Aleutian Low was weak.  Off the Russian 
coast, eight strong year classes in the past 25 years provided much of the recruitment that supported fisheries.  
Reduced recruitment occurred during periods of strong Aleutian Lows, suggesting that there is a common 
process affecting strong year-class development in the eastern and western North Pacific.  Russian studies 
identified a relationship between good larval survival and the opportunity of the crabs to spawn in shallower 
coastal depths of 30 to 50 m.  Migration into these areas was related to bottom temperatures which are linked 
to oceanographic conditions affecting near-bottom currents.  Mystery still surrounds the explanation for the 
mechanisms regulating their productivity, but it does appear that environmental factors are important, and 
there may be a relationship to the decadal shifts in the Aleutian Low.  Zheng and Kruse (2000) proposed that 
the diatoms that are important for first-feeding red king crab larvae are more abundant in years of light winds 
or weak Aleutian Lows when the water column is more stable. 
 
Common squid support major fisheries in Japan and Korea.  Abundances were high in the 1960s, declined in 
the 1970s through to the 1990s when there was a substantial increase.  The life span of common squid is 
approximately 1 year, thus, trends in their abundance are good indicators of changes in ecosystems.  Warm 
winter sea surface temperature appears to increase the spawning area, improving production.  There is a 
positive relationship between increased abundance of squid and euphasiid and amphipod abundance in the 
plankton.  The historic abundance trends are negatively related to the PDO, similar to trends in jack mackerel 
and opposite to trends in Japanese sardines. 
 
Trends in Major Fisheries 
 
We selected the major fisheries that were represented in this report to determine if the trends in catch were 
associated with decadal-scale trends in climate.  The species selected were the key species in the study area 
and, where possible, were common on both sides of the Pacific.  Catch information for Pacific salmon came 
from the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (www.npafc.org) and for other species, from the Food 
and Agriculture Organization (www.fao.org).  Our analysis relates only to the dynamics of the fisheries for the 
period 1970 to 2004.  The population dynamics of the species in the fisheries was not specifically considered 
in the analyses. 
 
For each species considered, we estimated the standardized catch anomalies for each year by subtracting the 
time series mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the catch.  The anomaly for each species was then 
lagged by the number of years it would take for the species to be recruited into the fishery (Table 1).  We then 
looked at the sign of the standardized anomalies to see if particular species grouped together by exhibiting 
similar trends of positive or negative anomalies.  Four groups were identified using this process, and the 
anomalies for species within a group were summed to produce the overall group anomalies which could be 
compared across groups (Fig. 2).  The pattern of anomalies for Pacific herring almost mirrored (opposite in 
sign) those of Pacific sardine and walleye pollock, so the inverse anomalies (changed sign) for Pacific herring 
were used, and the three species were included in the same group.

Run tests (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) were done to determine if there were trends in the group anomalies.  For 
each set of group anomalies, a binary sequence was generated with +1 being assigned for positive standardized 
anomalies and –1 for negative anomalies.  A run consists of one or more consecutive positive (or negative) 
values before the binary time series changes sign.  If the number of runs in the time series, r, is much smaller 
than the length of the time series, n, then there is evidence to suggest that the time series is not random.  The 
tests confirmed what is visually obvious in Figure 2 that there is strong evidence for runs in each of the four 
groups (Table 2). 
 
In most cases, there is no clear reason why the species fall within a specific group.  It could be that the species 
have similar life histories or occupy similar ecological niches.  It could be that their response to climate change 
is similar and related through some complex ecological process or that the fisheries are managed in a similar 
fashion.  It could also be that similar responses for species are entirely coincidental, a function of the criteria 
used for creating the groups, or that stock-specific responses (i.e., geographic differences) are blurred by 
averaging the responses for the entire species. 
 
Group 1 (Pacific cod, Pacific hake, Pacific halibut, sockeye, pink, and chum salmon) contained fisheries that 
generally were larger during periods of intense Aleutian Lows (or positive PDOs).  Catches increased fairly 
rapidly following the 1977 regime shift and have generally been above the 1970–2004 average since the mid-
1980s.  Group 2 (hairtail, anchovy, yellow croaker, and jack mackerel) fisheries generally increased as well 
following the 1977 regime shift although perhaps at a slower rate than those species in Group 1.  The Group 2 
species exhibited a more intense response to the 1989 regime shift and have remained at fairly high levels of 
abundance.  Group 3 fisheries (chinook and coho salmon, as well as chub mackerel) tended to have aggregate 
catches that were generally above average prior to 1989 and then below average, with perhaps a return to better 
catches following the 1998 regime shift.  Group 4 species (Pacific sardine, walleye pollock and Pacific 
herring) tended to increase in abundance (decrease in abundance for Pacific herring) throughout the 1970s and 
1980s and then declined (increased for Pacific herring) following the 1989 regime shift.  Three fisheries, 
Pacific ocean perch, sablefish and Pacific saury, did not appear to fit in any of the other groups.  Pacific ocean 
perch and sablefish were the longest lived species considered in the study, and perhaps the large number of 
year classes supporting the fishery and the more conservative approach to management of these long-lived 
species masks changes associated with climate change.  It is clear that climate or ocean conditions can, and do, 
influence recruitment dramatically but there does not appear to be a strong climate signal detectable in the 
annual catch time series.  Pacific saury have one of the shortest life spans for the species examined in this 
study and there may be too much variation in the catch data to detect a climate signal, but one may still be 
present. 
 
Conclusion 
 
There is evidence that climate trends affect the production of the species that make up the major fisheries of 
Canada, Japan, People’s Republic of China, Republic of Korea, Russia and the United States of America.  
There also is evidence that the dynamics of major fisheries can be associated with trends in climate.  The type 
of climate that affects a particular species can vary depending on the mode of variability that is important to 
10 
the life history of the particular species.  Recognizing that species evolve to adapt to environmental pressures, 
it should be expected that different types of climate variability will be important.  It is noteworthy that climate 
effect frequently occurs in trends.  Unfortunately, the mechanisms linking climate trends to production are 
poorly understood.  Equally unfortunate is our inability to forecast how global warming will affect the 
dynamics of our key climate indicators, such as the winter intensity of the Aleutian Low.  Hindsight shows us 
that major fluctuations in the abundances of key species and their fisheries will occur in the future.  These 
fluctuations might be better anticipated today than 30 years ago, but we still lack an ability to forecast changes 
in trends that are useful to management.  A common factor affecting recruitment in all reports was the ocean 
conditions in the spawning and rearing area that affected the amount of prey available to first-feeding young.    
The key to discovering the mechanisms may be to conduct research before, during and after the events that 
cause a cycle of production to shift.  Such research could be facilitated if the mechanism that shifts regimes 
could be determined.  Accordingly, researching the physics of regime shifts is considered important.

The Fishery  
Total fishery landings of all marine fish off the west 
coast of Canada (Fig. 3) increased during the 1980s, 
reaching a maximum of 417,777 t in 1994, and   
declined through to the present, approaching 
landings common in the early 1980s (Fig. 4).  The 
commercial fishery off Canada’s west coast has been 
strongly influenced by the size and value of the wild 
Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) fishery.  
Catches of all species of Pacific salmon reached 
historic high levels by the late 1980s (Fig. 5; 
Beamish and Noakes, 2004), followed by a 
precipitous decline to historic low levels from the 
late 1990s to the present.

The increase to the historic high levels and the rapid 
decline to historic low levels was a result of climate 
changes and management (Beamish et al., 2000; 
Beamish and Noakes, 2004).  The increases in the 
1980s occurred because marine survival improved 
after the 1977 regime shift (Beamish and Bouillon, 
1993) and management actions adapted to the 
improved ocean productivity by increasing 
escapements and protecting freshwater spawning 
habitat.  However, another regime shift occurred in 
1989 (Hare and Mantua, 2000; McFarlane et al., 
2000), which generally reduced the marine survival 
rate, and productivity of Pacific salmon that went to 
 
sea in the early 1990s (Beamish et al., 2004a).  It is 
possible that some overfishing occurred in the early 
1990s, particularly for coho salmon (O. kisutch) and 
perhaps chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), 
exacerbating the effects of the reduced marine 
productivity.  As a result, the total returns of some 
stocks and some stock aggregates became so small 
that fisheries had to be reduced or shut down 
completely.  Consequently, the total catches declined 
in part because of the reduced abundance, and in part 
because fisheries were closed or reduced.  The decline 
in total catch in 2001 compared to the total Pacific 
salmon catch in 1985 was approximately 90,000 t,

which was about 1.5 times greater than the average 
total catch of 60,000 t of all species of Pacific salmon 
in British Columbia from 1922 through to 2000. 
 
The decline in Pacific salmon catch and the subsequent 
management decisions to close fisheries also appear to 
be related to economic conditions (Noakes et al., 2002).  
There was a steady increase in the production of farmed 
salmon in British Columbia and in the world that 
paralleled the decline in the abundance of wild Pacific 
salmon in British Columbia.  In British Columbia, the 
production of farmed salmon, which is primarily 
Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), increased from 0.12 t in 
1985 to 67.7 t in 2001 (Fig. 6A and B). 
 
Another major change in ocean conditions occurred in 
1998 (Fig. 7).  This change was associated with 
 
 improved marine survival of Pacific salmon in British  
Columbia (Beamish et al., 2001; Beamish and 
Noakes, 2004; Beamish et al., 2004a).  The abundance 
of a number of species increased and in some cases, 
such as pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) produced in the 
Fraser River, the returns in 2001 and 2003 were at 
historic high levels (Beamish and Noakes, 2004).  
However, despite these increases in abundance, new 
considerations in management and reduced value of 
wild salmon continue to influence the size of catches. 
 
The total landed value of all British Columbia 
fisheries, including farmed salmon, has been virtually 
constant at an average value of about CAD (Canadian) 
$600 million since 1993 (Fig. 8).  The total catch of all 
species, including farmed salmon production, has 
declined slightly since the early 1990s (Fig. 9).

The total landed value of all fisheries, including 
farmed fish and shellfish, was CAD $580.4 million 
in 2001.  The landed value of wild fish and shellfish 
was CAD $293.8 million.  The landed values have 
actually increased since the 1980s, in part from the 
health and wealth associated with the fisheries for 
Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), Pacific halibut 
(Hippoglossus stenolepis), sablefish (Anoplopoma 
fimbria), and Pacific hake (Merluccius productus).  
There is some discrepancy between the Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the UN and 
Canada’s Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) 
statistics (Fig. 10A–F), but in general, there has not 
been extreme year-to-year variability.  In fact, catches 
of Pacific halibut, sablefish and Pacific hake were 
relatively stable from the late 1980s to the late 1990s.

In this report, we focus on ten key species in the 
fishery off Canada’s Pacific coast.  These ten species 
accounted for approximately 43 to 73% of the weight 
of total landings from 1980 to 2000 (Table 3).  Some 
of these species, such as Pacific halibut, Pacific 
herring, Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), and 
sockeye salmon (O. nerka) have been key species in 
the fishery since the late 1800s.  Estimates of 
production are available for Pacific herring, Pacific 
halibut, Pacific hake, sablefish, and for pink and 
sockeye salmon from the Fraser River (Fig. 11).  
Catch is a good indicator of abundance for Pacific 
salmon up to the mid-1990s because exploitation 
rates were high (60–80%) and tended to be constant. 
 
The longevity of a species may be an indication of 
the environmental impact on reproduction.  
McFarlane and Beamish (1986) hypothesized that the 
longevity of a species represents the longest period 
over evolutionary time that the species survived 
conditions unsuitable for successful reproduction in 
the preferred habitat.  A species evolves to adapt to 
extreme climate-related variability in its preferred 
habitat.  In the absence of fishing, the age structure 
of a population maximizes its ability to survive 
extremes in the mode of climate variability that most 
affects its ability to replenish itself. 
  
Short-lived marine species, such as coho salmon and 
pink salmon, will be the immediate indicators of 
change and would be expected to have evolved the 
ability to survive wide fluctuations in their marine 
habitat at the population level.  Pacific cod (Gadus 
macrocephalus) off British Columbia is at the 
southern limit of its distribution and may also 
provide an early indication of climate change 
impacts. 
 
The longevities of fishes in the British Columbia 
fisheries increase from species that live 3 to 10 years, 
including Pacific salmon, to species that live 11 to 30 
years, such as skate and some sole species   through 
to species that live from 33 to 205 years, including 
walleye pollock and some rockfish species (Table 4).  
It would be expected that the strategies evolved to 
survive the various kinds of natural climate 
variability in the ocean habitat would differ among 
these types of fishes. This means that any assessment 
of climate impact on fish and fisheries must consider 
the impacts on the life history strategy of the 
particular species, as well as on its physiology.  We 
propose that a working hypothesis for the impacts of 
global warming could be that the apparent impact 
may be related to longevity of a species.  Thus, a 
short-lived species, such as pink salmon, would 
respond quickly to the impacts and the consequences 
would be detectable perhaps in a decade.  Long-lived 
species could buffer the impact and it may take many 
decades to detect the response.

Climate and Ocean Impacts 
There are five marine ecosystems off the west coast 
of British Columbia:  (1) the Strait of Georgia,  
(2) west coast of Vancouver Island, (3) west coast of 
Queen Charlotte Islands, (4) Queen Charlotte Sound, 
and (5) Hecate Strait (Fig. 3).  There is evidence that 
a north–south boundary exists and that the climate on 
either side oscillates as the climate regimes shift.  
Moore and McKendry (1996) showed that levels of 
snow pack and large river flows followed opposite 
trends in the northern and southern areas of the 
province.  Prior to 1977, large river flows and snow 
pack in the southern part of British Columbia were 
above average, while flows and snow pack in the 
northern areas were below average (Moore and 
McKendry, 1996; Beamish et al., 2000).  This 
pattern reversed after the 1977 regime shift. 
  
There is a minimum in the average sea level pressure 
off the west coast at about latitude 55°N (Beamish et 
al., 2000) and it is possible that the oscillation in 
climate, observed on land, may also occur in ocean 
ecosystems at approximately 55°N latitude.  Hare et 
al. (1999) reported a decadal-scale, north–south 
oscillation in the catch of coho and chinook salmon, 
although they did not identify the area where the 
oscillation was centred. 
  
Beamish et al. (2000) looked at the latitudinal position 
of the lowest pressure from 1965 to the present and 
found a shift northward in the latitude of the lowest  
 
annual sea level pressure beginning in the mid-1970s.  
In addition to the northward shift of this area of low 
pressure, there was an increase in the variance of the 
average sea level pressure (mb) for 50°N between 
125°W and 180°W (Beamish et al., 2000). The trends 
were reversed after the 1977 regime shift.  Thus, there 
is evidence that changing trends in climate may affect 
the same species differently on the west coast of 
Canada, depending on its latitudinal distribution. 
 
Hollowed and Wooster (1992) reported shifts in 
winter sea surface temperatures (SSTs) for the 
coastal and offshore areas off the coast of British 
Columbia.  Freeland et al. (1997) suggested that 
there is an overall warming trend in SSTs for the 
British Columbia coastal waters.  When the SSTs for 
an area from 141°W to 123°W and 35°N to 60°N are 
broken into three regimes (pre-1977, 1977–1989, and 
post-1989) for winter and annual averages, a 
difference in warming is detectable.  While there was 
an overall warming trend in winter, exhibited by 
warmer temperatures for the entire coast in 1989–
1996, compared to 1965–1976, the increase in 
temperature was greater in the regime 1977–1988 
than in 1989–1996.  These differences in the amount 
of warming across regimes are not evident in 
annually averaged data.  On an annual basis, there is 
a continuous increase in temperatures across 
regimes.  Winter is an important period for 
reproduction of many British Columbia fishes; thus it 
is important to monitor climate–ocean systems 
during winter.

Fig. 12   Mean annual sea surface temperature measured at lighthouses around the Strait of Georgia from 1915 to 2004.   
A linear trend indicates an increase of 1.0°C over 90 years. 
 
 
For inshore waters, like the Strait of Georgia, SSTs 
are measured at lighthouses or are available from 
temperature profiles.  There is a long-term increasing 
trend in SSTs of 1.0°C from 1915 to 2004 (Fig. 12).  
Within the Strait of Georgia, SSTs from lighthouses 
were below average prior to 1977, were just above 
average from 1977 to about 1988, and in the 1990s 
continued to increase.  SSTs measured just offshore 
from Nanoose Bay in the Strait of Georgia also 
exhibited a similar pattern.  Bottom temperatures at 
this site have shown an overall warming, with the 
switch from below average to above average 
temperatures occurring in the late 1970s.  It is 
important to note that the regional indicators of 
decadal-scale changes measure similar ocean–
climate systems as do the basin-scale indicators.  
Changes in the large-scale climate and ocean 
indicators, therefore, would be expected to be 
reflected in the dynamics of the coastal 
oceanography off British Columbia.  Beamish et al. 
(2000) reported that the winter (December through 
March) atmospheric patterns over British Columbia 
generally match those for the Pacific region.  Prior to 
1977, the winter frequencies of westerly and 
northwesterly circulations were above average.  
Since 1977, southwesterly circulation was above 
average until about 1991, when westerly or 
northwesterly circulation was again above average.  
The regime from 1977–1988 could be classified as a 
period of extreme low pressures and extreme 
variation.  The post-1988 regime was characterized 
by a return to higher average annual pressures.  
There are studies that report north–south differences 
in Pacific salmon catch (Hare et al., 1999) and ocean 
processes (Gargett, 1997).  It is likely that these 
north–south differences are related to the changing 
pressure trends around 55°N.   
  
Large rivers are important influences in the 
productivity of coastal areas in British Columbia.  
River flows into areas such as the Strait of Georgia 
have a significant impact on the estuarine circulation, 
and consequently on primary productivity.  The 
largest rivers in British Columbia are also the 
important spawning areas for Pacific salmon.  The 
Skeena, Nass and Fraser rivers originate from 
mountain snow packs and all produce large numbers 
of salmon.  The maximum discharge from these rivers 
occurs about June, whereas smaller, more coastal 
rivers that receive most of their water from winter 
rains have their maximum discharge in the winter.  
Flow data are available for these smaller rivers, but the 
time series are too limited to allow for any kind of 
province-wide study.  The average annual pattern of 
discharge from the Skeena, Nass and Fraser rivers 
shows distinct changes around 1977 (Beamish et al., 
2000).  The northern rivers, the Skeena and Nass, both 
exhibited a decreasing trend in discharge from the 
late-1950s to 1976, and an increasing trend from 1977 
to 1989.  The increases in discharge post-1976 
corresponded to the heavier than average snow pack 
observed in northern British Columbia by Moore and 
McKendry (1996).   The Fraser River exhibited an 
increase in discharge from 1945 to 1976 and a 
decreasing trend from 1977 to 1989, which again 
corresponds to snow pack variation observed by 
Moore and McKendry (1996).  Even with the opposite 
linear trends in the northern and southern rivers, in the 
regime prior to 1977, extreme high and low discharge 
years were virtually identical in all three rivers and 
 
27
fluctuations were more frequent and extreme.  After 
1977, the inter-annual fluctuations were less extreme 
and the extreme years in the south no longer matched 
those in the north. 
  
Although there has not been a clear change  in the total 
annual discharge for the Fraser River after the 1989 
regime shift, there has been a clear change in the timing 
of the onset of the spring flows.  The April discharges 
have dramatically increased since 1989 and were higher 
than all previous April flows.  This indicates an earlier 
start of the spring freshet that eventually leads to the 
maximum discharge in June.  As the Fraser River 
discharge is closely related to the oceanography of the 
Strait of Georgia via estuarine circulation (Thomson, 
1981), it would be expected that changes in discharge 
would have impacts on the dynamics of this marine 
ecosystem. 
  
Potential Impacts of Global Warming on 
the Climate and Ocean Environment of Key 
Species in the Fishery 
In Canada, numerous senior government officials, 
business leaders, scientists and concerned citizens 
have characterized human-induced climate change as 
the greatest environmental and economic challenge 
of this century.  In fisheries science, there now is 
solid evidence that climate change profoundly 
impacts the population dynamics of important 
species.  No longer do scientists believe that 
abundance fluctuations are primarily a result of 
fishing effects.  There is also compelling evidence 
that the climate in the past is an unreliable predictor 
of the future.  This new understanding of the 
importance of including climate in fisheries 
management, along with the observation that the 
relationships of the past may not be guides for the 
future could be viewed as creating a crisis in 
fisheries management.  Certainly, it is clear that we 
need to assess how the past dynamics of a species 
can be used to forecast future dynamics.  If the past 
cannot be used as a guide to the future, there will be 
little choice but to reduce fishing in the face of 
uncertainty. 
  
The Third Assessment Report of the Inter-
governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 
2001a) provided a series of scenarios which 
indicated the kind of changes that will occur to future 
climates.  The extent of changes depends primarily 
on the level of emissions of CO
2
.  For example, if 
there are no changes in the current rate of increase of 
CO
2
, then the global average surface air temperature 
is predicted to increase by 3°C by the 2080s 
compared to the present.  The land areas will warm 
twice as fast as the oceans, with more warming 
occurring in the winter in high latitudes.  If CO
2
 
emissions can be controlled and stabilized at two 
times the pre-industrial levels (i.e., 550 ppm), or 
three times the pre-industrial levels (i.e., 750 ppm), 
then the impacts will be different.  A rise of 2°C 
about the present day, which is expected by the 
2050s, would be delayed by 50 years if CO
2
 
emissions were stabilized at 750 ppm and by over 
100 years if stabilization occurred at 550 ppm (IPCC, 
2001b).  If current CO
2
 emissions were reduced by 
60 to 70%, there would still be a 0.7°C increase in 
global average surface temperatures.  This is 
approximately the magnitude of change observed 
over the last 150 years.  Associated with this general 
warming in the past 150 years, there has been a 
gradual decrease in the number of cold days and an 
increase in the number of warm days.  In northern 
latitudes, winters have been wetter and summers 
drier.  The 1990s were particularly warm, with 1998 
being the warmest year since instrumental records 
began in the mid-1800s. 
  
A standard reference point used to provide a scale of 
possible change is 2°C by the 2050s if there is no 
change in the rate of CO
2 
production (if CO
2 
is 
stabilized at 550 ppm, the 2°C increase would occur 
about 2230).  Sea level rise is mainly associated with 
the thermal expansion of water and water from 
melting glaciers and ice caps.  This sea level rise is 
an inevitable consequence of global temperature 
increase.  The projected rise between 1990 and 2100 
is between 9 and 8.8 cm.  The central value is 4.8 
cm, which corresponds to an average rate of about 
two to four times the rate observed during the 20th 
century.  An estimate of a 40 cm increase in sea 
levels by the 2080s would be delayed by about 25 to 
40 years if CO
2 
emissions were stabilized at 750 or 
550 ppm, respectively.  The variation in the range of 
sea level rise at the regional level could be 
substantial.  It is likely that precipitation will 
increase in the northern mid-latitudes in the winter 
and in the northern high latitudes in the summer and 
winter.  There is an expectation that the increases in 
precipitation will also result in increases in extreme 
precipitation events.  Relative to the 1961 to 1990 
average, the expected increases of 20 to 40% appear 
modest, but there is not good agreement among 
models. 
28 
The variables associated with global warming that 
affect fish production are temperature, precipitation, 
winds, currents, sea level, salinity, upwelling, ice 
coverage, and UV-B radiation.  In the Third 
Assessment Report of the IPCC (IPCC, 2001a), there 
is better agreement among models about changes in 
temperature and sea level than about precipitation, 
winds, and storminess.  Temperature is important, 
but winds and storminess may be the parameters that 
most affect ecosystems in the subarctic Pacific.  The 
assessment of the impact of climate change on 
marine fishes in the third IPCC assessment report 
emphasized the impacts on the ecosystems that 
support the particular species of interest (IPCC, 
2001a).  The importance of temperature, salinity, 
nutrients, sea level, currents, and the amount of sea 
ice were noted, as all of these abiotic factors will be 
affected by climate change.  However, there was 
much greater emphasis on the impacts of the carrying 
capacity of ocean habitats than in the past.  The 
response of individual species to temperature change 
has been the focus for impacts because we know 
much more about temperature responses than the 
factors that affect carrying capacity.  There are 
examples in the Third Assessment Report of how 
temperature increases will affect abundances and 
distributions, have an impact on spawning success, 
affect larval and juvenile survival, affect growth, and 
the rate of food production which, in turn, affects 
food availability for a species.  However, scientists 
are increasingly recognizing that there are natural 
long-term fluctuations in fish production that occur 
over scales of 10 to 60 years.  These natural cycles 
emphasize the importance of considering the 
ecosystem impacts of climate variations, as well as 
changes to individual species. The Third Assessment 
Report emphasizes that the assumptions that marine 
ecosystems are stable are no longer acceptable.  In 
fact, some scientists are proposing that the success of 
future fish stock assessments and the success in 
sustaining world fisheries would depend to a large 
extent on the ability to predict the impacts of climate 
change on the dynamics of marine ecosystems.  A 
complication in the understanding of climate impacts 
on ecosystems is the recent discovery that changes in 
ecosystem dynamics may occur quickly and persist 
in a new organization on a decadal scale. 
  
Decadal-scale variability is now a generally accepted 
phenomenon within the fisheries science community 
(Beamish et al., 1999; Hare and Mantua, 2000; 
Benson and Trites, 2002).  Large-scale climate 
oscillations have been described for the Arctic 
(Thompson and Wallace, 1998), the Atlantic (Hurrell, 
1995), and the Pacific (Beamish et al., 2000; Hare and 
Mantua, 2000; McFarlane et al., 2000).  General 
trends in atmospheric circulation patterns that change 
quickly to new states have also been described for 
areas over Europe and over the subarctic Pacific (King 
et al., 1998; Beamish et al., 1999).  The North Atlantic 
Oscillation has recently been shown to be related to a 
variety of marine ecosystem changes, and new 
regime-related explanations for old events are 
routinely being described. The large inter-decadal 
climate fluctuations that occurred in the North Pacific 
have not yet been reproduced effectively in climate 
models; however, they are a critical component of the 
variability.  In the Pacific, decadal-scale variability 
results in abrupt changes in the dynamics of mid-
ocean and coastal ecosystems (Deser et al., 1996).  
Coupled global climate models or atmosphere–ocean 
general circulation models will have to be able to 
simulate the regime shifts before it will be possible 
to predict the changes to the dynamics of the fish 
populations in these ecosystems.  One attempt to 
assess the decadal-scale changes by Mote et al. 
(1999) indicated that both the UK Hadley Centre  
and Canadian Climate Centre models predicted an 
increase in the intensity of the Aleutian Low pressure 
area in the winter in the subarctic Pacific.  One 
model indicated a general trend towards stormier 
winters, while the other model indicated a greater 
variability followed by an increased trend to stormier 
winters.  Increased storminess has been associated 
with increased production in the open ocean, but the 
impacts of a combination of warmer oceans and 
increased storminess remain to be determined. 
 
Because decadal-scale variability can be large, and 
the causes are not known, it is possible that one of 
the most important impacts of global warming will 
be the change in the nature of decadal-scale 
variability.  More frequent changes and more 
extreme changes will have profound impacts on 
ocean currents, followed by impacts on the dynamics 
of fish, fisheries, and fisheries management.  
Evidence for such impacts can be found in the effects 
observed in the 1990s for species such as coho 
(Beamish et al., 2000).  The magnitude and 
abruptness of such changes may become the major 
factor in the regulation and management of marine 
fisheries. 
 
The impacts of decadal-scale changes in climate that 
may be superimposed on a gradual warming trend 
are difficult to forecast.  We know that after the 1977 
 
29
regime shift there was an abrupt increase in sea 
surface temperatures that was maintained.  A good 
example of this change was observed in the Strait of 
Georgia (Beamish et al., 2002; Fig. 13).  There was 
an abrupt increase in sea surface temperatures in 
1977, followed by another increase after the 1989 
shift.  In recent years, there has been a cooling 
following the 1998 regime shift.  The cause of these 
climate shifts is not known. Changes in river 
discharge can be harmful to Pacific salmon that must 
migrate up the Fraser River in the summer during 
peak discharge (Morrison et al., 2002).  Morrison et 
al. estimated that greenhouse gas-induced climate 
change would cause a modest 5% increase in average 
flow over the years 2070 to 2099.  However, they 
found that the peak flow would decrease by 18%, 
and on average would occur 24 days earlier.  We 
suggest that regime shift impacts would exacerbate 
the impacts of changes in flows combined with 
temperature increases of 1.9°C (Morrison et al., 
2002).  The additional energy required to migrate to 
spawning areas may stress Pacific salmon, making 
them susceptible to disease and other sources of 
mortality. 
  
There is a north–south coastal oscillation in Pacific 
salmon production (Hare et al., 1999).  Chinook and 
coho salmon have higher marine survivals in the 
north during intense Aleutian Lows than in the south.  
Another mode of climate variability that has been 
reported to affect Pacific salmon and other west coast 
marine species is El Niño–Southern Oscillation 
(ENSO).  State-of-the-art Global Climate Change 
Models are increasingly improving their ability to 
model ENSO changes in relation to greenhouse gas 
accumulations.  Recent scenarios appear to be 
predicting more frequent El Niños or perhaps longer 
El Niño-like states (Timmerman et al., 1999).  It is 
critical that we understand how these modes of 
variability will change because we need to consider 
how the less variable changes in temperature or 
precipitation will impact on the biological processes 
that characterize the particular species. 
 
Model predictions for coastal British Columbia 
indicate that for a doubling of CO
2
, average surface 
temperature increases would range between 2° and 
4°C.  Precipitation increases would be greater in the 
south in the winter, perhaps a 30 to 40% increase, 
compared to a 10 to 20% increase in the north.  In 
general, changes for British Columbia that can be 
inferred from recent model outputs for a doubling of 
the CO
2 
scenario are that there would be an average 
temperature increase of about 2.9°C and a decrease 
(1.1 cm) in precipitation in the summer and an 
increase (3.4 cm) in the winter.  There seems to be 
better agreement that the winters will be warmer and 
wetter, but there is less agreement about whether the 
summers will be wetter or drier (Mote et al., 1999).

Beamish et al. (1997a) acknowledged that there is 
considerable uncertainty about the physical changes 
that will occur in the ocean habitat of key species in 
the marine fisheries of British Columbia.  IPCC 
(1990) calculated that the warming would increase 
biological productivity in the coastal areas off the 
west coast of North America.  Hsieh and Boer (1992) 
proposed that the opposite would happen.  Beamish 
et al. (2002) suggested that the modelled scenarios of 
Mote et al. (1999) might mean that there would be a 
tendency for stormier winters and thus more 
conditions similar to those of the 1977 to 1989 
regime.  Welch et al. (1998) proposed that sea 
surface temperatures had an overriding influence on 
the distribution of sockeye salmon resulting in a 
more northerly distribution.  Beamish et al. (1997b) 
reported that other factors in addition to temperature 
affect the relative abundance and distribution of 
fishes.  There is a carrying capacity for the various 
species in aquatic systems that are a function of the 
biology of the species and its interrelationships with 
its environment and associated species.  Specific 
factors that regulate the carrying capacity are poorly 
known for virtually all species, but we do know that 
there is some stability in the relationships among 
species, as large fluctuations in abundances are not 
common.    
  
A summary of the potential global warming impacts 
is presented in Table 5.   At the end of this report, we 
will discuss how these potential changes will affect 
 
the population dynamics of key species in the fishery 
that are described in the following section. 
 
Key Species in the Fishery 
Sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) 
Biology 
Sablefish are distributed from northern Mexico to the 
Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands, along the edge of 
the continental shelf in the Bering Sea to the coasts of 
Siberia, Kamchatka and northern Japan.  In Canada, 
most juvenile sablefish inhabit the shallow waters of 
Hecate Strait and the west coast of Vancouver Island, 
and move to slope waters off northern and southern 
British Columbia as they mature. 
 
It is believed that there are two sablefish populations 
of the west coast of North America, separated at 
approximately 50°N into an Alaskan population and 
a west coast population. There is debate about the 
degree of movement between these two populations.  
Recent information using stable isotopes found in 
otoliths indicates that a third population may exist at 
the southern limit of the distribution.  Adult sablefish 
are abundant in coastal British Columbia waters at 
depths greater than 200 m, and are most abundant 
between 600 and 800 m.  Spawning occurs from 
January to March along the entire Pacific coast, at 
depths of about 300 to 500 m, with no appreciable 
 
Table 5   Summary of potential changes and impacts of climate change by the year 2050. 
Change Impact 
Increase in air and ocean temperatures of 1º to 2ºC Freshwater temperature increases will affect Pacific salmon 
survival.  Ocean temperature changes will affect growth, 
juvenile survival and distributions of some species, such as 
Pacific salmon, Pacific cod and Pacific hake. 
 
Increased intensity of the Aleutian Low and more 
and longer periods of a positive Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation 
Greater variability in primary production with a trend to 
improved abundance of long-lived species as a result of more 
frequent stronger year classes. 
 
More frequent north–south oscillations in coastal 
productivity 
In association with coastal warming, species off Vancouver 
Island will have reduced long-term production, while species in 
the north will have increasing trends in production. 
 
Increased coastal precipitation and reduced coastal 
salinity 
River flows will be reduced in the summer and will be higher in 
the winter. The lower flows and warmer temperatures will 
increase pre-spawning mortality of Pacific salmon.

latitudinal spawning migration.  Larval fish hatch at 
about 300 to 400 m, and then descend to 1000 m by 
18 days after spawning. Within a few days of their 
descent, larval sablefish begin to ascend and feed on 
copepod larvae. Recruitment appears to be 
determined at the larval stage.  Juveniles are found in 
shallow (< 200 m) inshore waters and rear in 
nearshore and shelf habitats until age 2 to 5.   As 
sablefish mature, they move back into the deeper 
water where spawning occurred. 
  
Growth of young sablefish is rapid in the first few 
years, and then slows appreciably in this long-lived 
species.  Length and age at 50% maturity are 58 cm, 
age 5 for females, and 53 cm, age 5 for males.  Males 
tend to undergo a reduction in growth rate earlier 
than females.  The majority of fish in the fishery are 
between the ages of 4 and 35, but the oldest sablefish 
aged to date is 113 years.  In Canadian waters 
important prey items for sablefish include rockfish, 
Pacific herring and squid. 
   
Fishery 
The sablefish fishery is one of the few and oldest 
deep water fisheries of the world.  The fishery was 
reported to be as large as about 6000 t in the 1910s.  
This early fishery provided a smoked or salted meat 
product as well as livers for vitamin A and D 
production.  The fishery was encouraged as a way to 
adapt to a shortage of meat during the First World 
War (Ketchen and Forrester, 1954).  Catches 
declined into the 1920s, possibly because of a 
reduced demand after the war.  It was not until the 
late 1960s that catches of sablefish increased as a 
consequence of a Japanese fishery established 
outside of Canada’s exclusive fishing zone.  
Following the extension of the exclusive fishing zone 
in 1977, the fishery was exclusively Canadian and 
accounted for annual catches ranging from 830 t in 
1978 to 5,381 t in 1989.  The average commercial 
landings from 1978 to 2002 were 4,071 t (Fig. 11).  
Sablefish landings fluctuated in the 1990s, with 
declines in recent years (Fig. 10C).  The declines in 
catch are related to stock assessments that recognize 
a decline in biomass as indicated by the declining 
trend in catch per unit effort (Fig. 11D).  Since 1973 
the dominant fishing gear used by the fishery has 
been Korean conical traps (73% of the annual 
landings).  In 1990, the fishery switched to an 
individual quota for each vessel in an attempt to 
 
stabilize the length of the fishing season, improve 
management, optimize the landed value, and reduce 
quota over-runs. 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
Sablefish exhibit decadal-scale patterns in the 
relative success of year classes (King et al., 2000).  
By combining estimates of relative abundance of 
year classes determined from commercial catches 
and research surveys for adults and juveniles, 
McFarlane and Beamish (1992) and King et al. 
(2000) were able to reconstruct an index of year-
class success.  Year classes from 1960 to 1976 were 
generally poor with no indication of good year-class 
success.  The 1977 year class was exceptionally large 
and year classes from 1978 to 1988 were generally 
average to better than average.  Year classes 
following 1989 and 1990 were generally poor. 
McFarlane and Beamish (1986) proposed that 
sablefish live up to > 70 years because their ability to 
reproduce successfully each year was restricted by 
their biology and habitat.  Their longevity represents 
the longest period of unsuccessful reproduction over 
evolutionary time.  If this hypothesis is valid, 
sablefish recruitment is closely related to specific 
kinds of climate-related ocean conditions. One 
limiting factor would be the ability of the fragile 
eggs to remain suspended in mid-depths and for the 
larval sablefish to find copepod eggs and nauplii 
immediately after they begin exogenous feeding.  It 
was observed that despite high fecundity, strong year 
classes resulted from both large and small spawning 
biomass (McFarlane and Beamish, 1986).  It was 
also observed that the production of strong year 
classes was closely associated with copepod 
production at a site off the west coast of Vancouver 
Island (McFarlane and Beamish, 1992).  The periods 
of above average year-class strength coincided with 
stronger Aleutian Lows, more frequent southwesterly 
winds, below average temperatures in the subarctic 
Pacific and warmer sea surface temperatures off the 
west coast of British Columbia (King et al., 2000).  
In general, the pattern of year-class success matches 
the patterns of regimes and regime shifts.  This is 
evidence that there are trends in sablefish production 
that are related to climate and ocean conditions on a 
decadal scale.  The recent declines in biomass  
(Fig. 11D) reflect fishing removal and declining 
recruitment, which is related to the generally less 
productive regime in the 1990s.

Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) 
Biology 
Pacific herring have traditionally been one of the 
major fisheries off Canada’s west coast.  They are 
pelagic, occurring both inshore and offshore from 
California to the Beaufort Sea.  In British Columbia 
they enter the current fishery at age 2+ or in their 
third year of life.  Few live past 7 or 8 years, 
although the maximum age is 15 years.  They are 
sexually mature by age 2 to 5 years.  In British 
Columbia, the fecundity of Pacific herring tends to 
increase with age and latitude, from about 19,000 
eggs for a 2-year-old female, to a maximum of 
38,000 eggs for an 8-year-old. The fish migrate into 
shallow waters in late fall to spawn, and return to 
deeper waters in late March and early April after 
spawning.  After hatching, larval herring remain in 
the surface waters, and after a few months they form 
the large schools typical of adult behaviour.  Pacific 
herring grow rapidly in their first 2 or 3 years until 
they reach sexual maturity, then growth rates decline. 
 
Fishery 
Pacific herring are easily fished when they migrate 
inshore to spawn in intertidal and subtidal areas.  The 
British Columbia herring population consists of north 
coast stocks (Queen Charlotte Islands, Prince Rupert 
and Central Coast), and south coast stocks (Strait of 
Georgia and west coast of Vancouver Island).  The 
fishery is managed separately for these five areas.  
The current fishery removes between 30,000 and 
40,000 t of adults, but earlier fisheries harvested 
more than 200,000 t in some years (Hourston and 
Haegele, 1980).  The Pacific herring fishery appears 
to have started in British Columbia about 1877 
(Hourston and Haegele, 1980).  After the collapse of 
the Pacific sardine in the late 1940s, Pacific herring 
became the major fishery off Canada’s Pacific coast, 
and catches steadily increased to over 200,000 t in 
the early 1960s.  Prior to 1970, Pacific herring were 
fished to produce fish meal and fish oil.  Since 1970 
virtually all Pacific herring are fished for roe, which 
is sold in Japan.  The fishery was shut down for a 
brief period from 1967 to 1970 because of poor stock 
conditions, but in 1972 a fishery for roe began.  
Recent catch levels are a consequence of both good 
stock conditions and a high demand for roe  
(Fig. 11A).  There has been some fluctuation in catch 
(Fig. 10A) that reflect interannual changes in 
biomass (Fig. 11A), but in general, herring 
populations are considered to be healthy.  In some 
areas, in some years, the abundances are low, but in 
others, such as the Strait of Georgia, the abundances 
are at historic high levels.  Recruitment levels have 
been estimated as part of annual stock assessments 
(Schweigert et al., 1998), and these estimates can be 
used to identify relative year-class strength.  The 
fishery closure from 1967 to 1971 is clear evidence 
of overfishing in the early 1960s (Hourston and 
Haegele, 1980). 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
Pacific herring have supported a major fishery off 
British Columbia since the early 1900s.  Pacific 
herring stocks sustained almost 20 years of high 
catches from the 1940s through to the 1950s.  
However, there was a change in climate in the 1960s 
and herring recruitment declined suddenly.  
Unfortunately, the reduced recruitment was not 
detected and the population was severely overfished 
(Hourston and Haegele, 1980).  After the fishery was 
closed in 1967, stocks recovered relatively quickly 
and fishing commenced in the 1970s.  The lesson 
learned was that climate and ocean conditions can 
have profound impacts on the recruitment and 
abundance trends.  Another lesson is that Pacific 
herring appear to be responsive to short-term, climate-
related variability.  The most important mode of 
variability for herring may not be the regime scale.  
  
Ware (1991) studied the fluctuations in Pacific 
herring growth and abundance in southern British 
Columbia.  He concluded that much of the variation 
in herring recruitment was associated with changes 
in Pacific hake abundance, zooplankton biomass, and 
the pattern of moderate and strong ENSO events.  A 
negative correlation between size-at-age and sea 
surface temperature was believed to be related to 
fluctuations in plankton biomass that, in turn, were 
related to natural oscillations in the ocean and 
climate that occurred at periods of 5 to 16 years. 
Ware (1991) concluded that the abundance trends of 
Pacific herring (and other dominant migratory 
pelagic species) were strongly affected by 
oscillations in the climate–ocean environment. The 
timing of the changes in oscillations was observed to 
be more closely related to ENSO events than to the 
decadal- or regime-scale changes.  However, there 
was similarity in the timing of the years of regime 
shifts and the years of change in trends of abundance 
described by Ware (1991). 
 
In the Strait of Georgia, Beamish and McFarlane 
(1999) proposed that the key process that regulated 
 
33
herring abundance involved the timing of the vertical 
migrations and abundance of copepods.  McFarlane et 
al. (2000) also reported that Pacific herring survival 
was higher in the 1990s due to reduced predation by 
Pacific hake. The availability of copepods to larval 
herring immediately after yolk sac resorption was 
proposed as the fundamental mechanism that alters the 
dynamics of the fish community in the Strait of 
Georgia.  McFarlane et al. (2000) explained that the 
climate impact extended beyond changes in 
temperature and needed to be studied at the ecosystem 
level. Copepods are the component of the zooplankton 
community that links primary production to larval fish 
survival.  Most fish in the North Pacific reproduce in 
the winter, immediately before juvenile copepods 
begin to develop from their diapause state in deeper 
waters to their juvenile stage in the surface waters.  It 
is in the surface waters that the juvenile copepods 
complete their growth before returning to deep water 
in the late spring and summer (Miller et al., 1984).  
Changes in the timing of copepod seasonal migration 
have been observed for the North Pacific (Mackas et 
al., 1998; Mackas and Tsuda, 1999), and for the Strait 
of Georgia (Bornhold et al., 1998), and typically 
coincide with decadal regime shifts. 
  
Because Pacific herring are dependent on nearshore 
habitats for spawning, sea level rise and increased 
storminess would be expected to affect the dynamics 
of herring populations.  Temperature, salinity and 
ocean circulation patterns are influential in the 
survival of Pacific herring eggs and larvae (Stocker 
and Noakes, 1988).  On the west coast of Vancouver 
Island, recent increases in sea surface temperatures 
have been associated with poor recruitment, but in 
the Strait of Georgia there was an abrupt shift to 
warmer temperatures in 1976–1977 and herring 
abundance increased to levels believed to be close to 
historic high levels. Warmer surface temperatures off 
the west coast of Vancouver Island would be 
expected to be linked to increased Pacific hake 
abundance in the summer.  Increased Pacific hake 
abundance will result in increased predation in 
herring and reduced abundances. 
 
Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) 
Biology 
In Canadian waters, there are two distinct 
populations of Pacific hake: the Strait of Georgia 
population and the coastal population that occurs off 
the west coast of Vancouver Island and in Queen 
Charlotte Sound (Kabata and Whitaker, 1981; 
McFarlane and Beamish, 1985).  The coastal stock 
ranges from southern California to Queen Charlotte 
Sound.  Since the 1990s the percentage of the stock 
migrating to Canadian waters has increased, 
approaching 40% of the total coastal stock, and a 
range extension to southeast Alaska has been noted.  
Pacific hake have also been observed spawning off 
the west coast of Vancouver Island since 1994, 
although most hake spawn off California.  Prior to 
this, the northernmost limit for hake spawning was 
thought to be Cape Mendocino, California. 
  
Fish in the coastal population can reach a maximum 
age of 23 years; however, the majority of hake in 
Canadian waters are between the ages of 4 and 12.  
Pacific hake recruit to the Canadian fishery at 5 to 6 
years and a fork length of approximately 45 cm.  Hake 
show rapid, relatively constant growth to age 4, 
followed by little or no growth.  Spawning generally 
occurs at depths up to several hundred meters off 
south-central California from January to March.  In 
spring, adults migrate north and offshore to feed along 
the continental shelf and slope.  In summer they form 
large midwater aggregations near the continental shelf 
break.  Generally, it is the older age 5+, larger and 
predominantly female, hake that migrate in the 
Canadian zone.  Over half of females reach maturity 
by age 3 and a length of approximately 40 cm.  Hake 
have strong and weak year classes that are almost 
cyclic in the offshore stock, with strong year classes 
occurring every 3 to 4 years. 
 
Fishery 
Canadian landings of the coastal hake stock averaged 
51,000 t annually over the period 1966 to 1989, and 
85,000 t from 1990 to 1999.  Since then (2000–2002), 
landings have declined to an average of 43,000 t 
annually as a result of declining availability in the 
Canadian zone. The decline in catch (Fig. 10D) 
resulted from a reduced quota that reflects a gradual 
decline in biomass (Fig. 11C). 
  
Prior to 1977, the former Soviet Union caught the 
majority of Pacific hake in the Canadian zone, with 
Poland and Japan harvesting much smaller amounts.  
Since declaration of the 200-mile extended fishing 
zone in 1977, the Canadian fishery has been divided 
into shore-based, joint-venture, and foreign fisheries.  
In 1990, the foreign fishery was phased out.  Since 
the demand of Canadian shore-based processors 
remains below the available yield, the joint-venture 
34 
fishery continued through 2002.  The majority of the 
shore-based landings of the coastal hake stock are 
processed into surimi, fillets, or mince by domestic 
processing plants. 
 
Although significant aggregations of Pacific hake are 
found as far north as Queen Charlotte Sound, in most 
years the fishery has been concentrated below 49°N 
latitude off the south coast of Vancouver Island, 
where there are sufficient quantities of fish in 
proximity to processing plants.  
  
The average size of Pacific hake in the Strait of 
Georgia is smaller than in the coastal population.  
The size in the fishery declined during the late 1970s 
and early 1980s from 44 to 43 cm, and decreased 
again in the 1990s to 36 cm. The average size of 
age 4 Pacific hake in the Strait of Georgia declined 
7% in length and 16.3% in weight from 1979 to 1981 
(to approximately 40 cm and 410 g), respectively.  In 
the mid-1990s age 4 hake declined again, 13% in 
length and 51.2% in weight (to approximately 35 cm 
and 200 g, respectively).  The second decline in size 
at age occurred at the same time as an increase in 
numbers of Pacific hake in the Strait of Georgia, as a 
consequence of strong year classes in the 1990s.  
There is a small fishery for Pacific hake in the Strait 
of Georgia, but the small size of the species reduces 
their commercial importance. 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
The coastal migratory stock of Pacific hake is 
characterized by strong year classes every 3 or 4 
years (Dorn and Saunders, 1997).  However, recent 
strong year classes (1990 and perhaps 1994) are not 
as large as those in the 1970s and 1980s (Dorn and 
Saunders, 1997).  The 1989 climate-related 
ecosystem changes also had dramatic impacts on the 
migratory behaviour of the offshore stock. During 
the 1990s a larger percentage of the migrating stock 
from California entered the Canadian zone and 
migrated farther north than in the past into areas off 
the west coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands and 
into Hecate Strait (McFarlane et al., 2000).  This 
stock spawned off the west coast of Vancouver 
Island in 1994, rather than migrating to the 
traditional spawning grounds off California.  The 
projected long-term increase in temperatures may 
result in more offshore hake moving into the 
Canadian zone, and in the spawning and rearing area 
off California moving north.  However, upwelling 
and nutrient changes may reduce plankton 
productivity and thus year-class strength.  The 
mechanisms that regulate the abundance of Pacific 
hake are not known. Therefore, it is difficult to know 
how abundances will change.  If a greater percentage 
moves north in the summer, the abundance off 
Vancouver Island may increase over the next 50 
years, assuming the stocks are not overfished. 
  
Climate and ocean conditions are associated with 
year-class strength and migration, but the 
mechanisms that are linked to climate remain to be 
determined. There is a joint Canadian and United 
States process for managing the offshore Pacific 
hake stock, which could result in overfishing if 
adjustments are not made quickly during periods of 
poor recruitment. 
  
In the Strait of Georgia, there has been an increase in 
Pacific hake abundance in recent years that may be 
related to an earlier abundance of plankton, resulting 
in a closer matching of plankton production and 
spawning activities.  Conditions causing the 
improved survival appear not to be related to reduced 
Fraser River total flows, but to earlier spring flows 
and possibly to inflowing bottom water changes.  
Climate warming will likely result in earlier spring 
flows, indicating that Strait of Georgia hake will 
continue to experience high abundance.   
 
Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) 
Biology 
Pacific halibut are a large, fast growing species that 
can live to a maximum age of 55 years.  The 
maximum size is variable, but lengths to 267 cm and 
weights to 205 kg have been recorded.  They are 
distributed from southern California to the Bering Sea 
and across to Japan.  At present, the species is fished 
throughout its range in what may be considered a 
mature fishery.  As a result, few halibut live longer 
than 30 years, with most being removed before they 
are 15 years old.  The hook and line fishery is 
managed through the International Pacific Halibut 
Commission (IPHC) which has operated since 1923.  
The exploitable biomass is determined annually and 
quotas are set using a 20% exploitation rate.   
  
Large females can produce up to 3 million eggs 
annually.  Most spawning occurs in winter between 
December and February, off of the continental shelf 
at depths of 200–300 fathoms (about 365–550 m).  
Males mature around 7–8 years, females around 8–
 
35
12 years.  Fertilized eggs hatch after 15 days.  Larvae 
are free floating in their first few months and have 
eyes on both sides of their head.  During this early 
stage, one eye migrates to the same (right) side as the 
other eye.  Larval halibut are carried into shallower 
waters by currents, where they become bottom 
dwelling.  Adults are found from near surface to 600 
fathoms (1100 m).  Preferred habitat is in sandy and 
rocky substrates, along reefs and in areas where fish 
and marine invertebrates are abundant.   
 
Fishery 
The Pacific halibut fishery is one of the oldest and 
perhaps the most successful fishery off Canada’s 
Pacific coast.  Canadian and U.S. fishermen started 
fishing the species commercially in 1888.  Catches 
rose quickly to levels exceeding 30,000 t from 1914 
to 1916.  An international commission began to 
oversee the fishery in 1923 because the halibut that 
were fished in the Canadian and U.S. fisheries were 
recognized as one population and catches were 
declining. However, it was not until 1930 that catch 
was regulated by the commission.  Today, the 
abundance is considered to be at the highest levels in 
history (Fig. 14A; Clark and Hare, 2002).  A historic 
high abundance of a large, top predator is apparently 
inconsistent with world trends (Pauly et al., 1998; 
Myers and Worm, 2003).  The Canadian catch is a 
function of the available quota and effort up to 1977, 
as fishing was possible off the Pacific coast of the 
United States.  After 1977 Canadian fishermen were 
restricted to fishing only in waters off Canada 
(Fig. 14C).  The IPHC has reconstructed the 
exploitable biomass for the total population and for 
the exploitable biomass of halibut resident off the 
west coast of Canada, which is at historic high levels 
(Fig. 14B). 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
McCaughran (1997) reported that the productivity of 
the population declined from 1959 to 1972, 
consistent with a change in the marine survival after 
the 1947 regime shift.  At this time very high catch 
rates were set at approximately 38,000 t.  At the 
same time, foreign and domestic trawl fisheries 
caught and discarded large numbers of juvenile 
halibut that were incidental to their directed fisheries 
on other species.  The combined effects resulted in 
historic low levels in 1973.  McCaughran (1997) 
reported that the population would have declined 
naturally, and that the high fishing rate and large 
bycatch of juvenile halibut in the trawl fishery 
simply increased the rate of decline. 
 
Pacific halibut are now known to exhibit a non-
random response to environmental conditions in the 
ocean (McCaughran, 1997; Clark and Hare, 2002).  
The population will increase when the environment 
is favourable and the spawning biomass is adequate 
under the current approach to management.  Clark 
and Hare (2002) showed that inter-annual and 
decadal-scale environmental variability is the major 
source of recruitment variability under the current 
management strategy.  Recruitment beginning about 
age 8 years is related to the particular climate and 
ocean regime during the spawning year.  According 
to their analysis, the period from about 1947 to 1976 
was associated with reduced marine survival, while 
the period after 1977 was a period of above average 
marine survival.  Another way of wording their 
conclusion would be to say that fishing does not 
affect recruitment under the current approach to 
management, which has a conservative exploitation 
rate and maintains an adequate spawning biomass.  
The evidence is convincing that climate changes at 
the regime scale have been a major influence on the 
dynamics of the Pacific halibut fishery.  There also is 
evidence that halibut production is related to the 
lunar nodal cycle (Parker et al., 1995). 
 
Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus) 
Biology 
Pacific ocean perch is the dominant rockfish in the 
groundfish fishery.  However, the rockfish fishery 
has expanded to include up to 30 species (Table 6), 
and Pacific ocean perch is now about 30% of the 
total rockfish catch.  Pacific ocean perch is a deep-
water bottom species that lives up to 100 years.  The 
age at 50% maturity is about 8 years and fish are 
thought to be fully recruited to the fishery at age 11 
(Leaman, 1988).  They are a schooling species that 
can readily be overfished. 
 
Pacific ocean perch occur in the North Pacific from 
California to Russia.  They are found at a range of 
depths down to 800 m, but are common between 200 
to 400 m.  Abundance appears to be associated with 
preferred temperatures at about 5.5° to 6.0°C.  
Juveniles may be distributed over a broader 
temperature range.  Pacific ocean perch reproduce 
through internal fertilization.  About September, 
females retain sperm that is obtained from males, for 
36 
about 2 months prior to fertilization.  After eggs are 
fertilized, the females move into deeper water (500 
to 700 m) until larvae are released, in the  
late winter or early spring, apparently near the 
bottom.  Young Pacific ocean perch rear in the 
pelagic areas for several years before moving to 
deeper water.  There is a distinct relationship 
between size and depth, indicating that older and 
larger fish continue to move into deeper water.  Age 
at 50% maturity may be between 7 and 9 years and 
about 25 to 35 cm in length, depending on location.  
Fish are recruited to the fishery between ages 10 to 
15 years.  There is clear evidence of strong variation 
in year classes, which is an indication that the ocean 
environment strongly affects recruitment.

Fishery 
The history of the Pacific ocean perch fishery prior 
to 1956 is difficult to document due to poor catch 
records, and because early rockfish catches were not 
commonly reported by species (Westrheim, 1987).  
Thus, it is probable that the early rockfish catches 
were dominated by Pacific ocean perch.  In the late 
1950s, Pacific ocean perch were identified in the 
catch which began to rise due to a dramatic increase 
in foreign fishing.  Total catches increased rapidly 
from 3,000 t in 1956 to a maximum of 48,600 t in 
1966 (Westrheim, 1987), the majority of which was 
caught by the Russian fleet.  At this time, Pacific 
ocean perch represented over 50% of the total 
rockfish catches (Forrester et al., 1978).  By the time 
the 200-mile limit was implemented in 1977, the all-
nation catches had declined to approximately 6,000 t 
annually.  With the exception of a decrease in catch 
between 1991 and 1993 due to a change in fishing 
regulations (Richards, 1994), the Canadian fishery 
has maintained the catch close to the 6000 t level 
since the 1980s (Fig. 10E).  Overall, the importance 
of Pacific ocean perch in rockfish catches decreased, 
beginning in the 1960s. As the fishery expanded into 
new areas, catches of other rockfish species 
38 
increased, and catches of Pacific ocean perch 
decreased.  In particular, yellowtail, yellowmouth, 
and widow rockfish have become increasingly 
important in recent years (Table 6).  However, the 
proportion of Pacific ocean perch has been 
maintained at an average of 30% since 1996. 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
The effect of regimes on Pacific ocean perch 
productivity was considered for the first time in a 
2001 stock assessment (Schnute et al., 2001).  A key 
finding in the assessment was that trends in Pacific 
ocean perch recruitment reflected climate regime 
shifts.  Schnute et al. (2001) found that production 
was low prior to 1976, high during 1976–1988, and 
low again between 1989 and 1998.  Currently, there 
are no strong incoming year classes and the fishery is 
supported by fish produced during the 1977–1988 
regime.  If there is a low level of productivity in the 
post-1998 regime, it is likely that the stock will not 
maintain itself at current fishing rates.  However, the 
life history strategy of Pacific ocean perch lends 
itself to slow population growth and decline.  
Because of this, Schnute et al. (2001) stressed the 
importance of maintaining sufficient adult biomass 
so that the population can take advantage of future 
periods of improved recruitment.  It is interesting to 
note that this is the strategy that McCaughran (1997) 
proposed as the reason for success of the Pacific 
halibut fishery, and it is a strategy that recognizes 
regimes of differing productivity. 
 
Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) 
Biology 
Pacific sardines have only recently returned to waters 
off the west coast of Canada.  However, Pacific 
sardines were the largest fishery in the 1930s and 
1940s.  Historically, sardines entered British 
Columbia waters in mid-June and returned to 
southern spawning grounds (California) in mid- 
October.  Most spawning occurred from April to 
June in the southern California Bight.  It was 
primarily the older, larger sardines that migrated 
north to feed off British Columbia waters.   
  
Pacific sardines are distributed from northern Mexico 
to southeastern Alaska, although the main centres of 
concentration range from southern California–
northern Baja California to the southern regions of 
British Columbia.  There are two main spawning 
areas off southern California and Baja California. 
  
Evidence of sardine spawning in Canadian waters is 
recent, based on reports of adults with ripe eggs in 
1997, 1998, 1999 and 2004, and eggs and larvae 
taken off the west coast of Vancouver Island in 1992, 
1993, 1997 and 2004.  Age 0 juveniles ( ≈ 10 cm) 
were subsequently collected in March and April of 
1998, 1999 and 2004, suggesting successful 
spawning and rearing in the area. 
  
Sardines reach a size of 15 cm at age 1, 22 cm at age 
2, after which growth slows to about 1 cm per year.  
Females grow faster and larger than males.  The 
largest specimen was 39.4 cm long and weighed 
486 g.  The maximum recorded age was 13 years.  
Currently, in the Canadian fishery, few fish are older 
than 9 years, and most are 3 to 7 years old.  Pacific 
sardines are batch spawners; large fish (21 cm) release 
30,000 to 65,000 eggs per spawning.  A single large 
female can spawn about three batches, releasing 
almost 200,000 eggs per spawning season. About 50% 
of females are mature at age 1, and 100% by age 2. 
  
The diet of the sardine varies regionally, but as an 
omnivorous filter feeder, it includes copepods, 
diatoms, a variety of other zooplankton, and 
occasionally fish larvae. 
 
Fishery 
The fishery for Pacific sardines started in British 
Columbia in 1917 and quickly became the largest 
fishery on Canada’s Pacific coast with catches 
averaging about 40,000 t (Fig. 15A and B).  The 
Pacific sardines fished in Canadian waters were part 
of a population that was most abundant from 
southern California to southern British Columbia.  
The population off Canada’s west coast consisted of 
older and larger fish that migrated north in early 
summer (Hart, 1943) and returned south in the fall.  
The sardines fished off Canada were believed by 
some to be part of a genetically distinct population 
that spawned at the northern limit of the spawning 
distribution in the south (Felin, 1954; Radovich, 
1982).  Others believed that it was one population in 
which the older fish migrated successively farther 
north as they aged (Schweigert, 1988). 
 
The Canadian Pacific sardine fishery was 
concentrated from the late 1920s to the mid-1940s 
off the west coast of Vancouver Island, and extended

south to Washington State.  Virtually all of the catch 
was reduced into fish meal and oil.  The Canadian and 
U.S. fisheries in the 1930s and 1940s combined to 
become the largest fishery in both countries (Wolf, 
1992).  The Canadian fishery collapsed suddenly in 
1947, followed rapidly by the collapse of the U.S. 
fisheries which collapsed by 1951 (MacCall, 1979).  
Initially the collapse was blamed on overfishing, but 
recently the collapse was regarded as another example 
of overfishing at a time of unfavourable environmental 
conditions (MacCall, 1979; Ware and Thomson, 
1991).  The mechanism responsible for the natural 
decline remains to be discovered, but a clue is the 
amazing synchrony in the abundance fluctuations 
among the sardine fisheries in the Pacific Ocean off 
Japan, Chile, and North America (Kawasaki, 1991).  It 
is important to note that virtually no Pacific sardines 
were reported from waters off Canada after the 
collapse through to the early 1990s (Hargreaves et al., 
1994).  The population of Pacific sardines to the south 
of Canadian waters started to increase in the late 
1970s.  Beginning about 1992, Pacific sardines 
appeared off the west coast of Canada (Hargreaves et 
al., 1994; McFarlane and Beamish, 1999).  The 
increase in abundance persisted through to the present 
and reflects a dramatic increase in the general 
population (McFarlane and Beamish, 1999; 
McFarlane et al., 2000).  In recent years, a small 
fishery for Pacific sardines occurred off the west coast 
of Vancouver Island (Fig. 15B).  It is now generally 
accepted that the fluctuations in Pacific sardine 
abundance off Canada are related to climate and 
climate changes on a decadal scale.  Fishing in Canada 
and the United States exacerbated the natural decline 
of this short-lived species (Radovich, 1982) but it was 
a change in climate that started the decrease in the late 
1940s, and the increases in the late 1970s. 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
Kawasaki and Omori (1986) recognized synchrony 
in the trends of abundance of sardine populations off 
Japan, California and Chile.  The collapse of sardine 
stocks off Canada and the United States in the late 
1940s corresponded to the collapse off Japan.  
Beginning in the late 1970s, the stocks off Japan, 
California and Chile synchronously increased in 
abundance.  Stocks declined off Chile and Japan in 
the late 1980s and early 1990s, but those off 
California have not done so yet.  The results of 
Kawasaki and Omori’s study (1986) indicate that 
large fluctuations in sardine populations are a 
consequence of large-scale changes in the climate 
and ocean factors affecting their carrying capacity. 
40 
In 1992, sardines reappeared in British Columbia 
waters and were captured in both commercial and 
research catches of Pacific hake (McFarlane and 
Beamish, 1999). Their abundance was determined to 
be large enough to initiate an experimental 
commercial fishery in 1995.  Movement into the 
Canadian zone may be continuing because sardines 
are moving farther north each year.  The large 
abundance of sardines in the Canadian zone was 
observed prior to the major increase in temperature 
of the surface waters as a result of the 1997 El Niño 
(occurring in August and September) and persisted 
off British Columbia through 1998.  At the same 
time as large numbers of sardines appeared off 
British Columbia, the total abundance off California 
remained stable (450,000 t).  Catches off California 
have been maintained although catch decreased in 
1998.  Sardines remained abundant and spawned off 
the west coast of Vancouver Island in 1998 even 
though El Niño conditions did not persist.  The El 
Niño events in the 1950s through to the 1980s were 
not associated with changes in sardine movement 
and spawning biology.  Thus, while movement of 
sardines into areas of British Columbia may be 
associated with recent El Niño events, it is likely 
related to other changes in the ecosystem.  The 
changes in sardine distribution, abundance and 
spawning (and the similar changes in mackerel and 
hake) indicate that a shift in the dynamics of the 
ecosystem off British Columbia occurred in the early 
1990s. 
 
Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) 
Biology 
Pacific cod are widely distributed in the coastal 
North Pacific from the Bering Sea south to Santa 
Monica, California, and west to the Japan/East Sea.  
Pacific cod grow rapidly in the first year, reaching 30 
cm by age 1, and are sexually mature by 2 to 3 years 
old (Westrheim, 1987).  Length at first maturity is 
approximately 40 cm, and length at 50% maturity is 
55 cm.  Pacific cod tend to disperse into deeper 
waters to feed, and congregate to spawn in shallower 
waters from February to March.  They undergo a 
seasonal migration from shallow waters in the spring 
and summer to deeper waters in the fall and winter.  
Pacific cod in Canada are at the southern limit of 
their distribution and are therefore vulnerable to the 
expected climate and ocean changes.  Four stocks of 
Pacific cod are defined for management in British 
Columbia: Strait of Georgia, west coast of 
Vancouver Island, Queen Charlotte Sound and 
Hecate Strait.  In Hecate Strait, stock abundance 
remains at historic lows, recruitment of the last 9 
year classes has been below historic levels, and the 
1998 year class was the smallest ever.  Abundance 
off the west coast of Vancouver Island also remains 
low.  Pacific cod were common in the Strait of 
Georgia in the past.  Presently, few fish remain, 
possibly because of the increase in water 
temperatures in recent years. 
 
Fishery 
Small Pacific cod fisheries take place in Queen 
Charlotte Sound and off the lower west coast of 
Vancouver Island.  The major fishing occurs in 
Hecate Strait.  Pacific cod spawning stock biomass 
and recruitment has been estimated for Hecate Strait 
using stock reconstruction based on ages estimated 
from lengths (Haist and Fournier, 1998), on which 
management actions were based.  The species is a 
significant component of the multi-species 
groundfish fishery in Hecate Strait.  Annual yields 
have varied between a high of 8,870 t in 1987 to a 
low of approximately 200 t in 2001.  Landings since 
the mid-1990s have been very low (Fig. 10I).  The 
trawl fishery has undergone a number of significant 
changes in recent years.  Prior to 1992, the total catch 
of Pacific cod was unrestricted and the main 
management measures were area and season 
closures.  Total allowable catches were introduced in 
the Hecate Strait area in 1992, in response to 
declining abundance.  Trip limits were also 
introduced in the same year and these decreased 
steadily until 1995.  For the 1996 season, trawl 
catches were limited to bycatch only because of 
stock concerns.  Stock declines resulted from a 
decade of below average recruitment.  The pattern of 
recruitment (age 2+) off the west coast of Vancouver 
Island from 1960 to 1988 was similar to that of 
Hecate Strait with the recent regime (1989–1997) 
characterized by 9 years of very poor recruitment. 
 
Climate and ocean effects  
High sea levels in Prince Rupert area are associated 
with high transport through Hecate Strait, resulting in 
poor recruitment for Pacific cod.  Sea levels were high 
in the Prince Rupert area up until 2003, when they 
began to decline. The relationship between sea level 
and recruitment can be interpreted as an indication of 
the sensitivity of Pacific cod recruitment to ocean 
conditions.  Bottom temperatures in the range of 6° to 
 
41
7°C appear to be optimal for Pacific cod recruitment.  
Temperatures higher than 7°C will likely decrease 
recruitment.  Laboratory studies on the effect of 
temperature on Pacific cod egg survival indicate that 
the optimal temperature is between 3.5° and 4°C with 
an acceptable range of 2.5° to 8.5°C (Alderdice and 
Forrester, 1971).  Bottom temperatures in February 
that exceed 8.5°C would most probably reduce or 
eliminate recruitment.  The southern limit of the 
commercial abundance of Pacific cod is northern 
Oregon and the southern limit of landings has been 
southern Oregon.  Thus, there is little doubt that 
Pacific cod in British Columbia are at the southern 
limit of their distribution and are a sensitive indicator 
of temperature increases.  
  
One method of monitoring the impacts of a changing 
climate is to identify a few species that are common to 
a large number of areas, and that respond quickly to a 
changing climate.  Species should be commercially 
important so that continuous sampling is not a 
problem.  There also should be a sound understanding 
of biology and some insights into the mechanisms that 
naturally regulate abundance.  Pacific cod are a good 
indicator species in the Canadian zone. 
 
Pacific salmon  
We highlight the biology and fishery of pink, 
sockeye, and chum salmon.  We assess the impact 
climate and ocean effects, along with global warming 
effects, in a combined discussion for all species, 
including coho and chinook in a section following 
the species summaries.  
 
Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) 
Biology 
Pink salmon are the most abundant of the Pacific 
salmon in British Columbia waters and in the all-
nation catches of Pacific salmon.  They have the 
shortest life span, approximately 2 years from 
hatching, and are the smallest salmon species.  Pink 
salmon form distinct spawning brood-lines with 
some stocks spawning in years with even numbers 
(i.e., 1996) and some with odd numbers (i.e., 1997).  
The largest stocks of pink salmon occur in the Fraser 
River, where spawning occurs only in odd-numbered 
years. Farther north,
 
spawning occurs in all years with 
a tendency for the even-year spawning stocks to 
predominate.  Although pink salmon occur farther 
 
south than British Columbia, the centre of distribution 
is north of British Columbia.  Fraser River stocks, 
therefore, are close to the southern limit of the range. 
  
Females may produce 1,200 to 1,900 eggs depending 
on the stock and female body length.  Spawning 
occurs from July through to early fall in riverbeds 
with coarse gravel.  Pink salmon prefer to spawn in 
swift currents along the borders of streams or in riffle 
areas. 
 
Fishery 
Pink salmon are not highly esteemed in British 
Columbia, thus catches probably are not a good 
indicator of abundance.  This is particularly true in 
recent years when there has been exceptional 
production in some stocks with virtually no 
commercial fishery.  In Canada, total annual catches 
of pink salmon averaged 19,700 t, or approximately 
14.7 million fish, from 1959 to 2000.  Total catches 
of pink salmon increased after the 1977 regime shift, 
reaching a maximum in the early 1990s (Fig. 16).  
Since the early 1990s, there has been a dramatic 
reduction in catch.   
  
A recent analysis of the coast-wide production of 
pink salmon indicated that over the past decade, the 
spawning abundances may have doubled or tripled 
compared to numbers in the 1960s and 1970s 
(B. Riddell, personal communication).  Pink salmon 
produced in the Fraser River historically accounted 
for about 60% of the total British Columbia catch, 
although some of this 60% is caught by the United 
States.  Their population dynamics and the response 
of the fishery is probably a good indicator of the 
dynamics of most pink salmon stocks.  Virtually all 
stocks of pink salmon in the Fraser River spawn in 
odd-numbered years.  The reason for the persistent 
dominance of these “odd-year stocks” and the 
general phenomenon of dominance among pink 
salmon stocks is unknown.  In 2001 and 2003, there 
was a large return of pink salmon to the Fraser River.  
Management policy resulted in an exploitation rate 
on this return that was very low, resulting in a 
spawning escapement that was approximately two 
times the highest estimated escapement on record.  
These exceptional returns were produced from one of 
the lowest escapements on record in 1999.  Clearly, 
there was a dramatic increase in the marine survival 
of pink salmon fry entering the Strait of Georgia in 
2000.

Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) 
Biology 
Sockeye salmon are probably the fish that is of most 
interest to British Columbians.  The Fraser River 
stocks have averaged about 80% of the British 
Columbia sockeye production and 25% of the catch 
of all salmon in British Columbia.  These sockeye 
stocks can be considered to be at the southern edge 
of this species’ range and are susceptible to changes 
in both the freshwater and marine environments. 
 
Most sockeye salmon return to the Fraser River in 
July and August and spawn in the fall.  After 
hatching, alevins emerge in the spring and migrate 
into nearby lakes.  After a year in the lake, most 
sockeye migrate in the spring to the ocean, where 
they grow and undertake extensive migrations before 
returning to spawn 2 years later.  There are variations 
to this generalized life history (Foerster, 1968), but it 
is always a combination of a prolonged dependence 
on fresh water followed by a period of ocean 
residence of 2 to 3 years. 
 
43
Fishery 
Catches of sockeye follow a cyclic pattern.  Sockeye 
production in the Fraser River follows a 4-year cycle 
(Foerster, 1968).  For example, in 1997 there was the 
largest return of sockeye salmon in the 4-year cycle 
from 1994 to 1997, with fewer returns in 1998.  For 
the first half of the 20th century catches were 
variable, but relatively stable.  The total catch of 
sockeye salmon was low from about 1950 to 1975.  
The lowest catches occurred in 1965 and 1975.  
Catches increased dramatically, beginning in the late 
1970s, with the record catch of 42,500 t in 1993 
(Fig. 16), but declined quickly in the 1990s.  The 
lowest catches on record of 1,710 t occurred in 1999.  
The declining trend in recent years is largely a result 
of reduced Fraser River sockeye production, since 
total production estimates for sockeye salmon from 
the Skeena and Nass Rivers from 1970 to 1996 
(Wood et al., 1997) illustrate that production 
increased in these northern rivers in the 1990s.  The 
1989 regime shift has been associated with some of 
the lowest catches in the history of the fishery and 
the change is seen primarily in the southern stocks.  
A study by Beamish et al. (2004b) showed that the 
stock and recruitment relationships for Fraser River 
stocks are closely related to climate regimes.  The 
mechanism linking climate to marine survival may 
be growth in the first marine year (Beamish et al., 
2004b). 
 
Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) 
Biology 
Chum salmon may exist in about 800 rivers in 
British Columbia (Salo, 1991).  There are distinct 
summer and fall spawning stocks, with runs in the 
north being earlier than in the south.  In the south, 
spawning can occur from October to January.  The 
general biology of chum salmon in British Columbia 
is similar to chum in other areas.  In the spring, 
chums are some of the first salmon to enter the 
ocean, remaining in the nearshore areas until the end 
of May (Healey, 1980).  They then move into more 
coastal waters and by mid-summer they leave the 
inshore areas and migrate offshore and into the Gulf 
of Alaska (Hartt and Dell, 1986).  In recent years 
they have remained inshore in large numbers through 
to mid-September (Beamish and Folkes, 1998).  
Most chum salmon (about 60%) spend three winters 
in the ocean.  The remaining fish spend 2 or 4 years 
at sea, with very few spending 5 years at sea.  The 
average size at return is about 70 to 75 cm.  Since the 
late 1970s, chum salmon have been produced in 
hatcheries.  The total production reached a maximum 
in the early 1990s, and in recent years has declined.  
Chum eggs are hatched in hatcheries and the fry are 
fed in channels prior to release.  In some cases the 
fed fry are placed in sea pens and reared in salt water 
prior to release. 
Fishery 
Chum salmon are generally the last species caught in 
the commercial fisheries.  Most fisheries occur near 
river mouths, or what are called “terminal areas.”  
Fishing is with purse seines or gillnets.  Smaller 
fisheries occur using troll gear.  Chum salmon that 
retain their “silver colour” are frequently marketed 
for smoking.  Those that are coloured externally are 
valued only for their roe.  In recent years, catches 
increased in the late 1980s through to the early 1990s 
(Fig. 16).  Catches were low in the mid- to late 1990s 
through to the present.  Assessments of total 
production generally show that it has been stable for 
the past 30 years (Godbout et al., 2004; Spilsted, 
2004). 
 
Impacts of Global Warming on all Pacific 
Salmon in the Fishery 
Pacific salmon remain as the group of species that 
are of principal interest to British Columbians even 
though their commercial value has declined 
substantially.  It is useful to assess the impact of 
climate changes on all species of Pacific salmon, 
rather than assessing the impact only on sockeye 
salmon, which remains one of the most important 
species in the commercial salmon fishery.  The 
specific factors that regulate salmon abundance are 
not clearly identified, making it difficult to predict 
the impacts of altered ecosystems. Changes that 
could occur in fresh water as a consequence of 
climate change would have a major impact on Pacific 
salmon.  These would impact on the migrations, 
spawning, hatching, and early rearing phases.  
Physical changes in temperature, precipitation, 
groundwater discharge, and increased ice-free 
periods for lakes could affect community structure 
and the survival, growth, and distribution of salmon 
species (Meisner et al., 1987; Glantz, 1990; 
Magnuson et al., 1990; Chatters et al., 1991; Neitzel 
et al., 1991; Northcote, 1992).   
  
The Fraser River drainage in British Columbia is a 
major producer of Pacific salmon, accounting for 30 
44 
to 40% of all Pacific salmon produced in Canada.  
Because numerous stocks of the five species of 
salmon are at or near the southern limit of their 
range, the early impacts of climate change should be 
detectable in these stocks.  Levy (1992) investigated 
these potential impacts by formulating eight 
hypotheses and considering the possible responses of 
salmon to climate change.  His hypotheses can be 
summarized as follows: a warmer climate will 
increase water temperatures and decrease flows 
during spawning migrations, increasing pre-
spawning mortality and reducing egg deposition.  A 
warmer climate will increase water temperatures 
during egg incubation stages, causing premature fry 
emergence and increased fry-to-smolt mortality.  At 
the same time, a warmer climate will increase the 
severity and frequency of winter floods, thereby 
reducing egg-to-fry survival rates.  The productivity 
of lakes will be altered, but impacts on their 
suitability as nursery habitats for juvenile sockeye 
salmon is not known. 
  
It is highly probable that there will be a direct 
relationship between increased river temperatures 
and pre-spawning mortalities for all salmon.  In fact, 
in the late 1990s, abnormally high pre-spawning 
mortality occurred, and one of the explanations 
related the mortality to changes in climate.   The 
impact of climatic warming on winter water 
temperatures is uncertain.  Winter water 
temperatures are related to groundwater base flows, 
lake water runoff, precipitation levels, and perhaps 
changes in snowmelt patterns.  It is probable, 
however, that both summer and winter temperatures 
will be higher.  These changes are particularly 
relevant for coho and chinook salmon, which remain 
in fresh water during their first year after hatching.  
Warm summer water temperatures may be too high 
for optimal growth and may force the young salmon 
into suboptimal habitats.  Poor growth in fresh water 
may contribute to increased mortality in the ocean.  
Coho salmon are vulnerable to warming because 
their embryonic development is sensitive to warm 
winter temperatures (Murray et al., 1990).   
  
Pacific salmon are particularly susceptible to 
temperature fluctuations because they have adapted to 
thermal regimes in both fresh and salt water.  At the 
southern limits of salmon distribution, projected 
climatic changes would warm both marine and 
freshwater habitats, especially in the winter.  High 
temperature has a profound effect on fishes because 
they cannot regulate their body temperature.  Extreme 
temperatures may kill eggs, juveniles, or adult salmon; 
less extreme temperatures can affect growth, 
reproduction, and movement.  Recommended 
temperatures for most Pacific salmon in fresh water 
range from about 7° to 16°C (Reiser and Bjornn, 
1979), with extremes from 3° to 20°C. Upper lethal 
temperatures are 25° to 26°C.  Southern rivers could 
approach these higher limits under projected climatic 
scenarios.  In the marine phase of the life history of 
salmon, there are critical temperatures of 9° to 10°C 
that restrict feeding areas for salmon to areas cooler 
than these temperatures (Welch et al., 1995).  Ocean 
warming, particularly in the winter, could favour 
northern areas for the rearing of salmon. 
  
Stream discharge patterns have a high degree of 
variation, and changes in the variability of timing 
and the expected increase in variation could reduce 
the accuracy of management and result in the need 
for reduced exploitation rates. Virtually all sockeye 
salmon spawn in rivers that flow into or out of lakes. 
After hatching, fry move into the lake where they 
must remain for a minimum of one year.  Although 
there is uncertainty about how lakes will respond to a 
warmer climate, sockeye salmon in the Fraser River 
are at the extreme southern limit of their distributions 
and will be sensitive to changes in limnological 
conditions.  Excessive warming may affect the 
ability of young sockeye to grow to the sizes 
necessary for survival in the ocean. 
  
Warming of fresh water in the north may improve 
production.  Much of the increases in total Pacific 
salmon abundance in the 1980s occurred in Alaska 
stocks, possibly indicating that warming in fresh 
water and coastal areas at this time was beneficial for 
salmon production.  However, the function of 
northern aquatic systems has not been well 
documented, and large temperature increases could 
have unforeseen effects on Pacific salmon survival. 
  
Beamish and Noakes (2004) examined the role of 
climate change on the past, present and future of 
Pacific salmon species off the west coast of Canada.  
They suggested that existing stock assessment 
models might be inadequate to predict the dynamics 
of a stock in a future of climate change.  They 
provided one scenario that predicts an increase in the 
total production of Pacific salmon as climate 
changes. This contrasts with other interpretations, 
such as that of Welch et al. (1998), who used 
estimates of sea surface temperature increases to 
propose that the ocean habitat available to sockeye 
 
45
salmon would diminish and would move farther 
north.  Both scenarios are possible and need to be 
evaluated as climate changes become more extreme. 
Beamish and Noakes (2004) also noted that Pacific 
salmon may move into the Canadian Arctic in 
increasing numbers. 
 
Pacific salmon are well known for their homing 
ability from feeding areas in the open ocean to the 
exact areas of their birth in coastal freshwater rivers 
(Groot and Margolis, 1991).  Less well known is 
their ability to stray.  This straying rate can range up 
to 10% (Groot and Margolis, 1991), and it provides 
Pacific salmon with an ability to adapt to large-scale 
climate change such as past periods of glaciation.  
All five species of Pacific salmon have been reported 
in Canadian Arctic waters (Hunter, 1974; Craig and 
Haldorson, 1985; Babaluk et al., 2000), with pink 
salmon being the most frequently observed and 
chinook salmon the least frequently seen.  Babaluk et 
al. (2000) reported the first records of sockeye and 
pink salmon from Sachs Harbor on Banks Island in 
the Beaufort Sea.  Although Pacific salmon had been 
observed in this area previously, the report of 
Babaluk et al. (2000) represented extensions of these 
earlier records.  One report of a coho salmon caught 
on Great Bear Lake on 25 September, 1987 
represented an extension of 1500 km east of an 
earlier report at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska (Craig and 
Haldorson, 1985).  These reports are noteworthy 
because they highlight the rare occurrence of Pacific 
salmon in the Arctic; however, they also indicate that 
straying is occurring. 
  
The Arctic is one area that may be exhibiting early 
impacts of global warming.  Model predictions are 
that a doubling of CO
2 
would reduce the extent of sea 
ice by 60% and the volume by 25 to 45% (Gordon 
and O’Farrell, 1997; IPCC 2007).  There would also 
be greater freshwater runoff.  During the period 
1978–1996, there was a 2.9 to 3.5% per decade 
decrease in the extent of Arctic Sea ice (Cavalieri et 
al., 1997; Serreze et al., 2000; IPCC 2007).  If such 
dramatic changes continue, conditions favorable to 
straying and perhaps feeding for Pacific salmon may 
improve. 
  
In general, it is probable that the response of stocks 
north of 50° to 55°N will be different than stocks 
south of this area, based on a historical oscillation in 
productivity between northern and southern stocks 
(Hare et al., 1999). We speculate that in the future the 
importance of this oscillation will diminish as the 
southern stocks struggle to adapt to a climate-related 
variability that currently exists south of the existing 
limits of Fraser River stocks.  We expect that sockeye 
salmon and other Pacific salmon stocks in the Fraser 
River will be severely impacted, as they are virtually 
at their southern limits.  It is important to remember 
that Pacific salmon are anadromous. The impacts will 
be in both fresh water and the ocean.  In the ocean, we 
expect that the major sources of early marine mortality 
will become more variable and more extreme.  
Predation may increase as more pelagic predators, 
such as Pacific hake and mackerel, move north.  
Growth-based mortality (Beamish and Mahnken, 
2001) may become more important and more variable.  
It may be possible to mitigate climate-related changes 
in fresh water; however, adjusting management to 
adapt to climate-related changes in the ocean would 
range between challenging and impossible.  
Nonetheless, if climate-related impacts could be 
identified quickly, it may be possible to use this 
information to convince Canadians and other countries 
that reductions in greenhouse gases are essential for 
the protection of Pacific salmon at their southern 
range. 
  
Species, such as coho and chinook salmon, should be 
less impacted because these two species are not at 
their southern limits in British Columbia.   However, 
these are the two species that are most affected by 
hatchery production (Sweeting et al., 2003).  It 
should be apparent that the fundamental scientific 
assumptions used in the management of Canada’s 
Pacific salmon stocks must change.  The ocean’s 
capacity to produce salmon is now known to be an 
important consideration.  This means that 
management must now consider the impacts of both 
fishing and climate–ocean changes on an aggregate 
of stocks of species in marine ecosystems.  In 
hindsight, our expectations for the Pacific salmon 
resource on Canada’s west coast in the 1990s were 
not even close to what occurred.  Similarly, we know 
of no one who predicted that in 2001, the salmon 
returns to the Columbia River would be the largest 
on record and chinook salmon returns the largest 
since 1973 (Wakefield, 2001).  Thus, we need to 
accept that our fisheries management science is not 
adequate to describe the factors that regulate Pacific 
salmon populations.  The certainty of the future is 
that there will be continued change and that robust 
strategies need to be developed if we are to adapt 
successfully to both natural climate change and the 
modifications caused by human-produced green- 
house gases.

The short life span of pink salmon of 2 years 
between spawning, as well as their abundance and 
extensive distribution, makes pink salmon a desirable 
species for studies of environmental impacts such as 
greenhouse gas-induced climate change on the long-
term population dynamics of all Pacific salmon.  
This increase in marine survival in 2000 coincided 
with a major shift in the trend of climate indicators.  
Thus, there is solid evidence that pink salmon 
respond to climate changes in a time frame that could 
be used to detect the impacts of greenhouse gas-
induced climate change.  Pink salmon are an 
excellent indicator species because they are 
distributed throughout the subarctic Pacific and there 
is a long history of careful management.  The single 
year class and the short life span facilitate 
associations between climate change and estimates 
production.  Additionally, the tendency for pink 
salmon to stray may also become an important 
indicator of factors affecting distributions.  
  
We modified Levy’s (1992) hypotheses that 
evaluated the linkages between climate and 
biological systems that could be used to plan for 
managing fragile northern freshwater and marine 
ecosystems in a warmer climate (Table 7).  This table 
of possible impacts could be used to develop plans 
for the impacts of climate change on salmon fisheries 
throughout the range of Pacific salmon. 
 
Impacts of Global Warming on the Key 
Non-salmon Species in the Fishery 
A difficulty in forecasting climate change impacts on 
fisheries in British Columbia is the inability to obtain 
model outputs at a regional scale.  It is also necessary 
to integrate modes of natural climate variability in the 
model scenarios for greenhouse gas-induced change.  
There is ample evidence that the recruitment of many 
species of west coast fishes is affected by these modes 
of natural variability. Therefore, it makes sense that 
they must be included in model formulation. 
 
One way of assessing the impact of future climate 
change is to try to use past changes in the population 
dynamics of a species to identify future climate- 
related impacts.  There are two major difficulties 
with this approach.  One is that it is necessary to 
identify the impacts of fishing.  To do this, 
assumptions are made about stock and recruitment 
relationships which assume that climate and ocean

effects are random.  For example, the assumptions 
for the standard Ricker curve are that density-
dependent effects occur in fresh water (Ricker, 1954) 
and that there is no trend in the climate-related 
impacts (Ricker, 1958).  It is also virtually 
impossible to determine the objectives of fisheries 
management for the future.   
 
A second difficulty is that past climate trends are 
probably not a guide to the trends expected in the 
future.  Thus, if new climate states are to be 
expected, particularly more frequent extreme events, 
we should also expect new impacts.  Nevertheless, it 
is useful to consider how past changes in population 
dynamics might have been affected by climate, not 
necessarily as a guide for future interpretations, but 
as evidence that we can no longer view fishing 
impacts as the only factor affecting abundance, and 
that we will need to be vigilant in our monitoring and 
evaluation of future changes in fish stocks.  We 
estimate the impacts of climate change using our 
understanding of the biology of a species, our 
interpretation of the past impacts of fishing relative 
to the impacts of the ocean environment, and our 
belief that regimes and regime shifts are important 
and will become even more influential.  We used 
average values of climate change taken from the 
Third Assessment Report of the IPCC and consider 
how these changes could influence the environment 
of the major species in the fishery (Table 5).  A 
summary of the following impacts is included in 
Table 8. 
 
Sablefish 
Because adult sablefish appear to be able to adapt to 
natural short- and long-term shifts in ocean 
conditions, it is probable that global warming will 
not have impacts on adult sablefish in a time frame 
of 50 years that will threaten the long-term dynamics 
of the population.   This does not mean that specific 
global warming impacts on the survival of eggs, 
larvae and juveniles will not occur; rather, that the 
adult fish may be able to survive such adverse 
conditions.  Also, there will be time to detect 
changes in the population dynamics and to consider 
management options, but this does not mean that the 
population will be able to support current levels of 
exploitation, particularly at rates of around 15%. 
 
An immediate concern is the impact of fishing on the 
population structure and the natural ability of 
sablefish to survive in unfavourable conditions.  
Fishing impacts over the past 30 years have reduced 
the percentage of older fish in the population.  
Presumably, the remaining fish still have the ability 
to live for extended periods; however, there may be 
some changes in their biology if the fishery is in 
some way exerting a selective force on the genetic 
composition of the population.  If the impacts of 
global warming are negative and reproduction is less 
successful or fails, it may be important to ensure that 
a percentage of the existing population is allowed to 
live to the older ages that existed prior to commercial 
fishing.  This may be best accomplished by 
establishing no fishing zones that are in the most 
favourable spawning areas.  If periods of intense 
Aleutian Lows increase as a consequence of global 
warming, there is a possibility that recruitment 
periods may increase relative to the past 50 years. 
 
Pacific herring 
A key factor regulating abundance of Pacific herring 
appears to be predation (Ware and McFarlane, 1995; 
McFarlane et al., 2001).  A major predator is Pacific 
hake, which are at the northern limit of their 
distribution in British Columbia.  It is possible that 
more hake will migrate farther north as the coastal 
areas warm.  This will result in more predation on 
herring, providing offshore hake stocks are not 
overfished and reproduction off California and 
Oregon is not severely impacted by changes in ocean 
productivity. 
  
The present management strategy for herring allows 
fishing only when abundances are above a minimum 
spawning biomass. This strategy should be adequate 
to adapt to the uncertainty of the impacts of 
greenhouse gas-induced changes.  Recruitment levels 
have been estimated as part of annual stock 
assessments (Schweigert, 2001), and those estimates 
can be used to identify relative year-class strength.  
Since 1972, there are some consistent patterns in 
herring productivity, but the patterns are less clear 
than for other species. For herring in all five 
management areas, the regime shift years 1977 and 
1989 were years of good recruitment, as was 1985, a 
year of very intense Aleutian Low pressures.  
Generally, the regime prior to 1977 had better 
recruitment than from 1977 to 1989.  After 1989, 
recruitment in the Strait of Georgia has generally been 
above average, but recruitment continued to be poor in 
the other four areas until 1994.  The poor recruitment 
during the 1977–1988 regime could be associated with 
the observed shifts to warmer SSTs; however, it can 
48 
only be one indicator of the mechanism since Strait of 
Georgia stocks increased in the 1990s despite 
continued warming. 
 
It is tempting to conclude that herring are quite 
adaptable and may increase in abundance in some 
areas and decrease in others, possibly maintaining 
the current catch levels.  An important consideration 
is the commercial fishery removals.  The current 
fishery appears to be conservative and well managed 
with specific “cut-off” levels below which no fishing 
is allowed.  In addition, the demand for product is 
much less than in the 1950s and 1960s.  Thus, it is 
likely that the pressure to overfish that occurred in the

Columbia fishery in the next 50 years. 
Species Potential impact 
Sablefish Stocks in the south may be reduced, but the northern stock may benefit from more strong 
year classes.  A key factor will be the protection of the spawning stock from overfishing.  If 
overfishing does not occur, the adult population should be able to survive prolonged periods 
of poor recruitment over the next 50 years. 
Pacific herring Stocks in the Strait of Georgia should remain at high levels, but offshore stocks would be 
reduced by increased predation. 
Pacific hake The Strait of Georgia stock should continue at high abundance.  The offshore stock should 
also remain at higher abundance levels provided it is not overfished.  If abundance increases, 
more fish will move farther north, perhaps off the Queen Charlotte Islands and into Queen 
Charlotte Sound. 
Pacific halibut The abundance within the population should remain at high levels as a consequence of a 
stormier North Pacific in the winter.  The abundance off Canada may be reduced slightly as 
fewer juveniles migrate farther south.  
Pacific ocean perch The major impact will be increases in the frequency of strong year classes which will 
improve abundance. 
Pacific sardine In the Northeast Pacific, Pacific sardine abundances follow trends that are associated with 
the spawning and rearing environment off California and Mexico.  The mechanisms remain 
unknown.  If the Aleutian Low intensifies, it is possible that the trends in sardine production 
may continue, perhaps with increased production during favourable periods.  Off British 
Columbia, Pacific sardine will increase in abundance and may establish resident populations 
in increasing productivity regimes, but the natural fluctuations will still occur.  This means 
that one of the future regime shifts will result in conditions unfavourable for sardine 
reproduction and a natural collapse will occur.  However, there may be residual stocks of 
sardine that reside longer, or all year, in the Canadian zone as more sardines move north into 
it in the summer. 
Pacific cod Pacific cod will gradually disappear from the Strait of Georgia and off the west coast of 
Vancouver Island as bottom temperatures warm. 
Pacific salmon Pacific salmon from the Fraser River stocks will suffer major impacts in fresh water and in 
the ocean.  Sockeye, pink and chum from the Fraser River will be reduced in abundance as a 
consequence of reduced freshwater survival as juveniles and spawning adults.  The 
production of wild coho and chinook will also be reduced, but the reduction will be less than 
for the other species.  Pacific salmon stocks from the Skeena and Nass rivers and to the north 
will increase in abundance as a result of improved ocean productivity.  Pacific salmon will 
begin to reproduce in Arctic rivers.  Pink salmon will be excellent indicators of climate-
related change.  Basin-scale changes in growth, survival, and straying rates will all indicate 
when large-scale changes occur. 
 
49
1960s will not be a factor.  We propose that the 
herring population in the Strait of Georgia will 
continue to be high as long as Pacific hake remain 
abundant and have a small size at age (i.e., no 
predation on herring).  On the west coast of 
Vancouver Island, the abundance of herring will 
fluctuate, but will generally remain low as a 
consequence of Pacific hake predation that could 
extend much farther north and reduce abundances off 
the Queen Charlotte Islands.  However, we emphasize 
that fluctuations will be common, as Pacific hake 
appear to be one of the key regulators of abundance. 
In the next 50 years, Pacific herring stocks will likely 
continue to fluctuate in abundance more or less in a 
manner similar to the dynamics observed during the 
past 25 years. 
 
   
Pacific hake 
There are two distinct and major populations of 
Pacific hake, one in the Strait of Georgia, and 
another off the west coast of Vancouver Island.  
There are also numerous small abundances of Pacific 
hake in the inlets along the British Columbia coast.  
The Strait of Georgia has been warming since the 
1960s but the reasons for the warming have not been 
determined.  Pacific hake in the Strait of Georgia 
have increased in abundance during this warming 
period and, at the same time, decreased their 
individual size.  We expect that the Strait of Georgia 
will continue to warm.  We also expect that the 
synchrony of improved primary production and 
intense Aleutian Lows or PDOs will continue, and 
even become more favourable for Pacific hake 
production.  Thus, Pacific hake will continue to be 
the dominant species in the Strait of Georgia and 
their individual size will remain smaller. 
  
Pacific hake off the west coast of Vancouver Island 
migrate into the Canadian zone from areas off 
California and Oregon.  Impacts of global warming 
will affect the amount of production, the numbers 
that migrate into the Canadian zone, and the northern 
extent of their migration.  As with Pacific sardine 
populations, an increase in the intensity of the 
Aleutian Lows and mid-ocean upwelling (as 
occurred in the 1980s) would result in an increase in 
the number and strength of above-average year 
classes, and subsequently mature biomass.  Increased 
warming in coastal waters will result in a greater 
proportion of mature fish migrating north into 
Canadian zone.  In addition, the extent of this 
migration will move farther north.  For example, the 
increase in temperature during the 1990s resulted in 
approximately 40% of the mature stock entering the 
Canadian zone, compared to 25% during the 1980s.  
In some of the years (1992, 1993, 1997, 1998) 
commercial quantities of Pacific hake were common 
in northern British Columbia waters, and in at least 
two of the years (1997, 1998), were captured in the 
Gulf of Alaska. 
 
Pacific halibut 
Pacific halibut are currently distributed from 
California to the Bering Sea, thus they are able to 
tolerate a wide range of temperature as adults.  The 
expected temperature increases in the next 50 years 
are well within this range.  Pacific halibut that are 
recruited to the southern part of their range are 
juveniles that reared farther north.  Unfortunately, the 
details of the recruitment of these juveniles into the 
area off British Columbia remains poorly understood.  
  
Halibut stocks are currently at historic high 
abundances, in part because of the favourable ocean 
conditions from the late 1970s through to the late 
1980s, and in part because of an error in the stock 
assessment that resulted in an underestimate of the 
total biomass.  Because halibut are widely distributed 
as adults, it is probable that the effect of climate–
ocean related changes is during the larval stage.  
Pacific halibut are now recognized to live to 55 years, 
although most fish in the fishery range in age from 
about 10 to 20 years. The existence of older fish in the 
population may indicate that over evolutionary time 
Pacific halibut experienced prolonged periods of poor 
recruitment. Therefore, future periods of poor 
recruitment should be expected.  If, in the future, areas 
need to be closed to protect spawning stocks, there 
would need to be an agreement between Canada and 
the United States as both countries share the 
responsibility for conservation of this species.  The 
fishery is managed by the IPHC which allows a 
percentage of the total biomass to be fished.  As 
declines occur, the catch is reduced.  At a minimum 
spawning biomass, no fishing would be allowed.  The 
population is therefore protected from overfishing.   
   
As for most species, the mechanisms that affect 
marine survival are unknown.  Thus it is not possible 
to interpret specific environmental changes, even if 
such changes could be forecasted.  In general, 
however, it is believed that strong onshore flows, 
resulting from strong northward flowing currents, are 
favourable for reproduction.  A concern is that there 
50 
could be a weakening of winds that could affect both 
the amount of onshore transport as well as the food 
required for the larval and young juveniles.  If the 
impacts of global warming weaken onshore transport 
and reduce productivity, then halibut year-class 
survival may be poor, and there may be prolonged 
periods of poor recruitment.  
  
In recent years, the percentage of the biomass in the 
southern portion of the range has decreased relative 
to the biomass in the mid-portion.  The reasons for 
the change are unknown, but could be an indication 
that halibut recruiting to the southern areas no longer 
moves as far south. 
  
The impact of climate change on halibut off British 
Columbia is most important at the larval and juvenile 
fish stage.  As the year-class strength probably is 
determined at this stage and most larval and juvenile 
halibut are found in ecosystems north of Canada, it 
will be the conditions in the Gulf of Alaska, and 
perhaps the Bering Sea, that are most influential.  The 
major factor affecting future production of the 
population appears to be the changes in the PDO or 
Aleutian Low.  If there is a strengthening as predicted 
by Mote et al. (1999) and Salanthé (2006), it is 
possible that changes might improve productivity, at 
least in the short-term.  However, fewer of these 
recruiting fish may migrate south into the Canadian 
zone.  Production in recent years has been at historic 
high levels. Thus, any increases in the strength of the 
Aleutian Low would continue production at these high 
levels.  If production of the population remained high 
on average, but southward migration was reduced, 
how would this affect the fishing quotas?  If the adults 
at the southern limit of their distribution contribute 
much less to the total production than fish spawning 
farther north, should the exploitation rate be constant 
for all areas?  It is probable that one consequence of 
greenhouse gas-induced climate change will be a 
requirement to re-negotiate existing fishing 
agreements with the United States. 
 
Pacific ocean perch 
Pacific ocean perch appear to respond to climate 
variability at the regime scale; however, given their 
late age at maturity, recruitment success or failure is 
not evident until long after year-class strength has 
been determined.  It is noteworthy that the 
abundance of Pacific ocean perch (and other slope 
rockfish) abundance has increased steadily or 
remained stable since the late 1980s (Richards et al., 
1997), as a result of very strong year classes in 1976, 
1980 and 1984, and average year classes in the early 
and mid-1980s.  These strong year classes began 
recruiting to the fishery in the late 1980s. The high 
abundance of these stocks in the current regime is a 
reflection of the productivity in the 1977–1988 
regime, a pattern similar to that described earlier for 
halibut. The inability to evaluate recruitment in time 
to make immediate changes to a fishery indicates that 
this species (and other rockfish with similar life 
histories) will likely be overfished if regime shifts 
occur more frequently.  The most appropriate 
management adaptation may be to reduce 
exploitation rates, and to ensure that some habitat is 
restricted to fishing. More frequent and more 
extreme shifts in the Aleutian Low or PDO will 
introduce more variability in the recruitment of 
Pacific ocean perch, and there will be more periods 
like that of 1977–1989 and less of the conditions 
typical of the 1947–1976 period.  With effective 
management, it is possible that there could be more 
frequent strong year classes. 
 
Pacific sardine 
We know from the studies of Kawasaki (1991) that 
fluctuations in the abundance of sardines are 
synchronous around the North and South Pacific 
Ocean.  We also know that around Japan there have 
been major fluctuations in sardine abundance for 
centuries (Beamish et al., 1999).  Although the exact 
mechanism or mechanisms that cause these 
fluctuations are not clearly understood, it is clear that 
fishing effects are only marginally involved.  Climate 
change and the associated changes in the ocean alter 
the conditions for successful reproduction in such a 
way that populations expand and contract rapidly on 
decadal scales.  These expansions and contractions 
occur quickly, confirming that climate impacts have 
profound and rapid effects on the structure of large 
marine ecosystems. 
  
The sardines that occur off British Columbia are 
produced to the south, off the coasts of California 
and Mexico.  There is some spawning off British 
Columbia, but it is minor.  We know that the period 
prior to 1947 was favourable for Pacific sardine 
production, and that the regime from 1948 to 1976 
was not favourable.  The sardine population 
increased off California from 1977 through to the 
early 1990s, indicating that periods of intense 
Aleutian Lows (positive PDO and stormy winters) 
resulted in improved sardine production.  If 
 
51
greenhouse gas-induced climate change will increase 
the frequency of periods of intense Aleutian Lows 
and increased mid-ocean, winter upwelling (Mote et 
al., 1999), then sardine population fluctuations 
should continue, possibly with more frequent 
favourable periods.  Off British Columbia, sardines 
will still fluctuate in abundance, but warmer coastal 
waters may result in greater abundances, possibly 
with resident populations being established.  
However, periods of collapse will still occur. 
 
Pacific cod 
Projections of temperature changes are for surface 
waters and ocean temperatures to change slower than 
land temperatures.  However, in the late 1990s, 
bottom temperatures in March in the Strait of 
Georgia were approximately 9.3°C.  Thus, it is 
apparent that several degrees of warming will change 
the southern limit of Pacific cod distribution, and 
will, perhaps, move it as far north as southern 
Alaska.  Pacific cod recruitment is therefore a 
sensitive indicator of ocean changes affecting 
groundfish.  It is predicted that they will gradually 
disappear from the Strait of Georgia and off the west 
coast of Vancouver Island as bottom temperatures 
warm.

The Fishery  
Seafood has always been a significant part of the 
Japanese diet and today accounts for about 40% of 
the protein consumed by Japanese people.  Domestic 
marine fisheries are generally divided into coastal 
fisheries, offshore fisheries, and distant-water 
fisheries (Table 9).  From 1972 to 1988, Japan had 
the world’s largest fisheries.  Catches increased 
through to 1984 with the maximum production of 
12,820,000 t.  The total catch of all marine species 
declined from the maximum in 1984 to 3,734,209 t 
in 2000 (Fig. 17).  This was a change from 16.0% of 
the world’s catch in 1984, to 5.1% in 2000.  In recent 
years, the fishery in China reportedly exceeds 
Japanese production.  At present, Japan is the largest 
importer of fish products in the world.  
Approximately one third of the world catch in weight 
is exported, and Japan imports about 15% in weight, 
or one quarter in value, of all exported fish products.  
The decline in catch in recent years (Fig. 17) is 
related to the natural decline in Japanese sardine 
abundance in the 1990s and the reduced catches in 
distant-water fisheries (Table 9, Fig. 18). 
 
Climate and Ocean Influences 
A major influence on the production of fish in the 
Japanese coastal and offshore fisheries is the 
structure and dynamics of the subarctic current, the 
Oyashio, the subtropical currents, the Kuroshio and 
Tsushima, and the transition area between the 
Oyashio and Kuroshio (Fig. 19).  The changes in 
currents affect vertical mixing, which alters the 
supply of nutrients to the surface production zone, as 
well as migration and larvae transportation.  Changes 
in nutrient supply affect primary production which, 
in turn, changes the abundance and species of 
zooplankton which are the principal food of fishes.  
Mechanistic linkages between climate and physical 
oceanographic changes and stock productivity 
generally occur through bottom-up scenarios.  In the 
Oyashio area, the major feeding grounds of sardine, 
chub mackerel, saury, common squid, and many 
other species, zooplankton density since the 1970s 
has been negatively correlated with sardine biomass; 
other processes controlling the sardine population 
may be occurring (Taniguchi, 1999).  Chiba et al. 
(2004) concluded that annual production of copepods

since the 1960s, along the “PH line” (41°30 ′N, 
142°E–147°E), representing the Oyashio, has 
decreased because of the attenuation of winter 
mixing. 
 
The biomass of large- and small-sized copepods 
from 1971 to 1989 in Kuroshio area was affected by 
Kuroshio meandering and winter solar radiation, 
respectively (Nakata et al., 2001).  The composition 
of zooplankton size and timing of the spring bloom 
in Tsushima, Kuroshio, and Kuroshio Extension 
would have significant effects on survival and 
growth of juvenile fishes, and thus on recruitment.  
The observed species replacements among small 
pelagics may be partly explained by such differences 
in availability of suitable zooplankton.  The period of 
the large Kuroshio meandering, called “A-type”, 
coincided with that of an intensified subtropical gyre 
and westerly winds.  In the northwestern area of the 
subtropical gyre, intensification of wind speed and 
destratification of surface waters generally result in a 
decrease of zooplankton biomass (Sugimoto and 
Tadokoro, 1998).  The mixed layer depth during the 
positive Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) period 
(1977–1988) was 30 to 80% deeper than the negative 
PDO period (1960–1976) in the subtropical and 
transition areas of the North Pacific, whereas the 
mixed layer depth was 20 to 30% shallower in the 
subarctic area (Polovina et al., 1995).  During the 
positive PDO period, zooplankton production is 
considered to increase by enhanced nutrient supply 
in the subtropical area (Taniguchi, 1999).  Polovina 
et al. (1995) observed that the mixed layer depth in 
 
the Oyashio area was approximately 10% deeper 
during 1977–1988 relative to the 1960–1976 level.  
The decadal change in mixed layer depth did not 
significantly affect the declining trend in lower 
trophic level production in the Oyashio area (Chiba 
et al., 2004).  Therefore, the effects of greenhouse 
gas production on water density and salinity may be 
more significant for low trophic production in the 
Oyashio area than in the PDO-related mixed layer 
depth. 
 
If winds are reduced by future warming of the ocean, 
the primary production in the seas around Japan may 
be reduced because of reduced vertical mixing in 
winter.  Warming could also reduce the nutrient 
supply to the subarctic gyre and thus decrease 
primary production in the Oyashio region.  However, 
variation in zooplankton biomass off Sanriku had a 
positive correlation with sea surface temperature 
(SST) and sunshine at Nemuro and a negative 
correlation with sea level pressure at Nemuro in the 
Oyashio (Fig. 20, Tomosada and Odate, 1995).  
Thus, higher SST and stormier conditions would 
improve productivity, although low zooplankton 
biomass in the Oyashio, Kuroshio and transition 
waters during the 1980s may have been caused by 
mass predation by Japanese sardine (Taniguchi, 
1999).  In general, the impacts of climate and ocean 
changes vary among areas and species, and the 
impacts are poorly understood, but it is clear that 
climate and ocean conditions are major influences in 
the production of fishes in the seas around Japan.

Key Species in the Fishery 
In our report, a stock is considered to be an 
aggregation of individuals that are fished as one unit.  
The definition does not imply that there are genetic 
differences among stocks.  A population is a large 
aggregation of individuals or stocks that have 
discrete migration patterns, spawning areas and/or 
spawning seasons, although there may be migrations 
of individuals among populations.  In this study we 
consider the impacts of climate and climate change 
on nine species (Table 10) that represented 
approximately 58 to 80% of the total catch between 
1980 and 2000.  Biomass and indices of production 
rates of selected stocks are shown in Figs. 21–24. 
Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) 
Biology 
Chub mackerel mature mostly at an age of 2 years 
and a fork length of 32 cm (Yatsu et al., 2002; 
Watanabe and Yatsu, 2004).  Spawning occurs 
during winter and spring in the area around the Izu 
Islands (Fig. 20), East China Sea and southern Japan 
Sea.  The Oyashio Current is a major feeding and 
rearing area in the Pacific Ocean.  The fisheries for 
chub mackerel target a wide range of size, including 
immature fish, which have been heavily fished since 
the 1990s. They feed on zooplankton, squids and 
fishes, particularly anchovy.

Fishery 
Two stocks, the Tsushima Current stock and the 
Pacific stock, contribute to the catch.  The Tsushima 
Current stock is distributed in the East China Sea, 
Yellow Sea, Bohai Sea, and the Japan Sea (Fig. 19).  
The Pacific stock is distributed along the Pacific 
coast of Japan and east to the Central North Pacific 
Ocean, including inside of the Exclusive Economic 
Zone (EEZ) of Russia (Belyaev and Ivanov, 1987).  
Migration between the Pacific stock and the 
Tsushima Current stock has been reported, but is 
believed to be rare. 
Climate and ocean effects 
Productivity of the Pacific stock was high in the 
early 1970s (Figs. 23 and 24) and catches were high 
in the 1980s when the PDO was generally negative 
(Table 11).  The productivity tends to be similar to 
 
that of the Japanese sardine and Pacific saury.  After 
the 1989 regime shift, chub mackerel did not recover, 
possibly as a consequence of the extensive fishing 
effort, especially for immature fish (Yatsu et al., 
2002).  Productivity of the Pacific stock was 
negatively related to the PDO without a lag (Fig. 25). 
The biomass of the Pacific stock of chub mackerel 
appears to be negatively related to PDO with a 1-
year lag (Fig. 26) and SST of  the northern Izu 
Islands in winter within the Kuroshio, which 
suggests that there is a relationship between SST and 
spawning success (Yatsu et al., 2005).  There was a 
distinct reduction in production (and catch) following 
the 1977 regime shift of the PDO to a positive state 
indicating that decadal-scale variability affects 
recruitment.  Sardine biomass also negatively 
affected the reproductive success of the Pacific stock 
of chub mackerel due to possible competition for 
prey during the larval stage (Yatsu et al., 2005).

Jack mackerel (Trachurus japonicus) 
Biology  
Jack mackerel mature at age 1 at a fork length of 
about 20 cm.  Maximum age is 5 years and 
maximum size is about 45 cm.  They tend to change 
their habitat from pelagic to near-bottom as they 
grow.  Jack mackerel are basically zooplankton 
feeders. 
 
Fishery 
Purse seines and set nets are the major methods of 
fishing.  Total catches mostly increased in the late 
1980s and remained high until 1999 (Table 12). 
Two stocks have been recognized for stock 
assessments:  the Pacific stock and the Tsushima 
Current stock.  The Pacific stock is distributed along 
the Pacific coast of Japan at about 145°E longitude 
and north to about 40°N latitude.  The Tsushima 
Current stock is distributed in the East China Sea and 
southern Japan Sea.   
 
Several tagging experiments and biological surveys 
have been conducted to study stock structure.  
Earlier, the Tsushima Current stock was divided into 
more than three stocks, but now it is treated as a 
single stock for assessments.  It is believed that both 
stocks overlap at the southern coast of Japan off 
Kyushu Island and have common spawning grounds 
in the East China Sea.  A new research project

on jack mackerel is using population genetics 
methods and models of larval transport to help 
determine the degree of overlapping distributions.  
The Tsushima Current stock extends into the Korean 
and Chinese waters beyond the Japanese EEZ. 
 
Both stocks have separate spawning grounds along 
the coast, but the common spawning area is in the 
East China Sea, located from 25° to 30°N.  The SST 
range at the spawning grounds is from 15° to 26°C 
(optimum 16°–17°C).  The SST in the fishing area is 
from 24° to 29°C. 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
The biomass of jack mackerel (both stocks 
combined) is positively correlated with winter SSTs 
of the Japan Sea, East China Sea and Pacific coast of 
southern Japan.  On the other hand, jack mackerel 
productivity and recruitment improved when the 
spring SST was lower in the East China Sea where 
major spawning occurs (Sassa and Konishi, 2002).  
Productivity appears to have been affected by the 
1988/89 regime shift (Figs. 23 and 24), although 
earlier shifts did not appear to have major impacts.  
There seems to be a negative relationship with PDO, 
in which the periods of positive PDO resulted in 
reduced productivity.  Thus, in the 1980s, catches 
were less than in the 1990s (Table 12). 
 
Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) 
Biology 
Japanese sardines mature at 17 cm in standard body 
length and the first age of maturation is 1 year during 
a low stock period and 3 years during a high stock 
period (Morimoto, 1998).  The species is recruited to 
the fishery at the age of about 6 months when 
commercial fisheries harvest Japanese sardines in the 
size range of 11 to 24 cm.  However, post-larvae 
individuals (whitebait or shirasu) are also fished 
 
67
during high stock abundance periods.  Maximum age 
is about 7 years and maximum lengths are 
approximately 25 cm.  Prey of sardine includes both 
zooplankton and phytoplankton, the latter of which is 
seldom utilized by other fishes.  
 
Two stocks of Japanese sardine have been recognized.  
The Pacific stock and the Tsushima Current stock are 
distinguished by their distributions and migration 
patterns.  The Pacific stock is distributed along the 
Pacific coast of Japan and east to 180° longitude 
during high abundance periods.  In periods of low 
abundance, only juveniles migrate into the Central 
North Pacific.  The western boundary of the Pacific 
stock coincides with the spawning areas from the 
eastern coast to Kyushu Island (Fig. 20) to northern 
Japan at high abundances.  In low abundances, the 
spawning area of the Pacific stock is the southern 
coast of Shikoku Island and central Japan.  Feeding 
areas are mainly in the Oyashio and Kuroshio–
Oyashio Transition Zone (KOTZ) in the summer and 
autumn.  The Pacific stock occurs in the EEZ of 
Russia and outside of the EEZ of Japan.  The 
Tsushima Current stock is distributed in the East 
China Sea and the Japan Sea.  The major spawning 
area is in the East China Sea and the southern part of 
the Japan Sea during the high stock period, but it 
shrinks to the East China Sea during the low 
abundance. The northern limit of their migration also 
shrinks from the Sakhalin waters and Okhotsk Sea to 
the southern part of the Japan Sea (Hiyama, 1998).  
There are no apparent genetic differences between the 
two stocks (Okazaki et al., 1996). 
 
Fishery 
Japanese sardines have a long history of large 
fluctuations in abundance (Table 13, Figs. 18 and 
21).  Kawasaki (1983) was the first to recognize that 
the fluctuations in sardine abundance were 
synchronous with sardine populations off the Pacific 
coast of North America and Chile.  Off Japan, the 
catches in the 1960s were about 10,000 t annually.  
In the mid-1970s the catches by Japan (and 
abundances) increased dramatically to about  
4 million t per year in the mid-1980s.  In the early 
1990s, catches (and abundances) decreased quickly 
to levels of less than 200,000 t in 2000 (Table 13). 
Climate and ocean effects 
The large fluctuations in abundance have been 
shown to relate to large-scale climate changes and 
not to unique local environmental conditions or to 
fishing (Figs. 25 and 26; Kawasaki, 1983).  Large-
scale or global climate change causes a strengthening 
or weakening of winds and ocean currents off the 
coast of Japan which affects the upwelling of 
nutrients and plankton production and larvae 
transportation (Kasai et al., 1997).  There is a 
relationship between the winter SST or subsurface 
temperature in the rearing area of juvenile sardines 
and their survival for both stocks (Hiyama et al., 
1995; Ebisawa and Kinoshita, 1998; Noto and 
Yasuda, 1999).  The ocean conditions, in turn, are 
related to direct atmospheric forcing on a decadal 
scale, as identified by the PDO and the boundaries of 
the Oyashio and Kuroshio Currents (Yatsu et al., 
2005). 
 
There are a number of studies on the impact of ocean 
conditions on the population dynamics of the 
Japanese sardine, as the fishery is important 
economically and socially to the Japanese people.  
Watanabe et al. (1995) showed that mortality after 
the end of the first-feeding stage, i.e., from post-larva 
to age 1, controlled year-class strength.  Hiyama et 
al. (1995) reported that both density-dependent 
effects and winter temperature of the western Japan 
Sea at 50 m depth are responsible for the 
reproductive success of the Tsushima Current stock. 
On the basis of a numerical model, Kasai et al. 
(1997) concluded that strong year classes of sardine 
can be formed by intensive transport of larvae to the 
Kuroshio Extension and by good survival in the 
KOTZ where nutrient supply is affected by the 
strength of the Oyashio. This conclusion was 
supported by Ebisawa and Kinoshita (1998) who 
detected a negative correlation between reproductive 
success of the Pacific stock and Oyashio expansion 
(represented by an area of SST < 10°C) in the Joban 
area (Fig. 20).  Thus, the more southern intrusion of 
the Oyashio coastal branch would enhance 
zooplankton production in the nursery ground of the 
KOTZ which supports survival of juveniles derived 
from spawning grounds formed offshore of Shikoku 
and Kyushu beyond the Kuroshio axis.  Noto and 
Yasuda (1999) showed that low SST in the southern

region of the Kuroshio Extension improved food 
production for larval sardines and resulted in 
improved year-class strength of the Pacific stock.  
When the southern region of the Kuroshio Extension 
is favorable for sardine survival, they are able to 
expand their adult distribution and their spawning 
areas.  A low SST is an index of mixed layer depth 
(Polovina et al., 1995).  In subtropical waters, 
including the Kuroshio, deeper mixing layers contain 
more nutrients in the spring and thus more 
productive habitat for juvenile sardines.  Conversely, 
warmer SSTs reduce productive habitat, and were 
shown to be related to high larval mortality.  If 
unfavorable conditions persist for more than 7 years, 
the life span of the Japanese sardine, the population 
that migrates over a wide area would collapse.  
Recent studies revealed that SST directly affects 
growth rates of larvae and juveniles, hence early 
survival rates (Takahashi et al., 2004; Takasuka et 
al., 2004).  The coastal population would remain, but 
would be small as the coastal habitat suitable for 
production is limited.  Noto and Yasuda (1999) 
suggested that the abrupt increase in SST in 1988 in 
the southern region of the Kuroshio Extension 
indicated a close relationship between decadal-scale 
climate changes and ocean changes, and the dramatic 
fluctuations in abundance. 
 
Anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) 
Biology 
Anchovy mature at a standard body length of about 6 
cm in coastal waters and at about 10 cm in offshore 
and oceanic waters.  Age and growth of Japanese 
anchovy are controversial, and growth may greatly 
fluctuate, depending on prey conditions and 
migration routes.  Annual rings in scales suggest 
slower growth (10 cm at 1 year, 14 cm at about  
2 years) in contrast to much faster growth estimated 
by daily increments in otoliths (the age of 12 to  
13 cm fish was 263 to 295 days) (Mitani, 2001).  
Recruitment into the fishery occurs at about the age 
of a few months (whitebait or shirasu) and the 
 
69
maximum age is about 3 years at a length of 14 cm, 
according to traditional age estimation with scales.  
Anchovy are zooplankton feeders.  
 
Fishery 
Three stocks are recognized for stock assessment: the 
Pacific stock, the Seto Inland Sea stock, and the 
Tsushima Current stock.  The boundaries among 
stocks are not always clear, especially during periods 
of large abundances as mixing and exchange 
sometimes occur, depending on their densities.  The 
Tsushima Current stock expands into the Russian, 
Korean, and Chinese waters, beyond the EEZ of 
Japan.  The Pacific stock is also distributed in 
Russian EEZ when the stock is abundant. 
  
Anchovy catches averaged 185,691 t between 1980 
and 1989, then increased to 311,427 t in 1990, and 
remained high in the 1990s, averaging 317,290 t 
between 1990 and 2000 (Table 14).  The major 
fisheries use purse seines and set nets; whitebait or 
shirasu are harvested by seine nets (a small-scale 
 
midwater trawl).  The spawning stock biomass was 
estimated using the procedures of virtual population 
analysis (VPA) and egg census surveys (FAJ, 2004a) 
for 1996 to 2000, and shows a major increase 
beginning in 1998. 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
In general, there is an alternating pattern of 
abundance between anchovy and sardine (Fig. 18).  
In the 1950s and 1960s, anchovy abundance was 
large when sardine abundance was small.  This 
pattern switched in the late 1970s and 1980s, 
reversing again in the 1990s.  Recent studies 
revealed that optimum SST on early growth rates of 
anchovy are higher than sardine, thus decadal shifts 
in SST may explain the alternation of sardine and 
anchovy through selective survival of larger or 
faster-growing individuals (Takahashi et al., 2004; 
Takasuka et al., 2004, 2007). It is apparent that the 
impacts of climate–ocean conditions are opposite for 
sardines and anchovies.

Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) 
Biology 
Walleye pollock are distributed throughout the water 
column to the bottom.  They mature at about age 3 
and 32 cm in standard body length (Keizo Yabuki, 
Hokkaido National Fisheries Research Institute, 
unpublished data).  There is debate about maximum 
ages, but there is some agreement that walleye 
pollock can live up to 33 years (King and McFarlane, 
2003).  There is a spawning migration from 
overwintering areas to distinct spawning areas, 
mainly in Nemuro Strait (Fig. 20), Funka Bay (the 
Pacific stock) and coastal areas of western Hokkaido 
and Sakhalin (the North Japan Sea stock).  However, 
the spawning area of the latter stock may have 
shrunk to the Hiyama and Iwanai districts (Fig. 20), 
southwestern Hokkaido, in response to stock decline.  
Eggs and larvae are pelagic and only loosely 
associated with a particular bottom area.  Walleye 
pollock consume a wide variety of prey, including 
krill, squids, fishes and demersal crustaceans.  
Cannibalism is common. 
 
Fishery 
Four stocks have been recognized for stock assessments 
around Japan:  the North Japan Sea stock, the Kitami 
(Okhotsk Sea) stock, the Nemuro stock, and the Pacific 
stock (Tsuji, 1989).  This separation is based on 
information relating to spatial distribution, tagging, age 
and growth data, morphometric characteristics, and 
ecological considerations.  The North Japan Sea stock is 
distributed in the northeastern area of the Japan Sea.  
The Kitami, or Okhotsk Sea, stock is distributed in the 
southwestern part of the Okhotsk Sea.  The Nemuro 
stock is found during the spawning season in Nemuro 
Strait.  The Pacific stock is distributed along the Pacific 
coast of the northeastern part of Honshu, Hokkaido, and 
south Kuril Islands.  Tagging studies carried out in the 
past 40 years have indicated that fish normally migrate 
among these four stocks (Yoshida, 1982).  Biochemical 
studies have not revealed genetic differences among the 
four stocks (Iwata, 1975).  All stocks, except the 
Nemuro stock, have two or more spawning grounds.  
The stability of the spawning stock units and the 
characteristics of a stock change with the environment 
and population abundances (Kyushin et al., 1961; Tsuji, 
1978).  There are also walleye pollock that are pelagic 
during the feeding period and spawn with a variety of 
stocks (Ogata, 1956; Yoshida, 1982).  All stocks are 
 
also distributed within the Russian EEZ.  Catch 
statistics indicate a constant decline in catch since 1980 
(Table 15).  However, biomass estimates (Fig. 22) 
indicate that there was an increase in the 1980s in the 
North Japan Sea stock, but a decrease in the Pacific 
stock. 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
Figures 23 and 24 show that there is no relationship 
between walleye pollock productivity and regime 
shifts, although there were decadal-scale fluctuations 
in estimated biomass.  The productivity of the North 
Japan Sea stock is positively related to SST in the 
spawning grounds in the winter.  The productivity of 
the Pacific stock is positively related to SST of 
southern Hokkaido in winter and spring.  It appears 
that ocean conditions affect productivity and result in 
trends that are approximately decadal; however, 
there is no clear relationship with standard large-
scale indices of climate.  In the Pacific stock, strong 
year classes were produced in 1981, 1991, 1994, 
1995 and 2000 (FAJ, 2004a).  Strong year classes of 
the North Japan Sea stock were observed in 1984, 
1985, 1986 and 1988 (FAJ, 2004a).  Mechanistic 
linkages between occurrences of strong year class 
and environmental conditions remain unknown. 
 
Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) 
Biology 
Chum salmon are anadromous.  In Japan, virtually all 
chum salmon are reared in hatcheries and released 
after a short rearing period following hatching.  In 
the ocean, the fry remain in coastal areas for several 
months before they move offshore (Urawa, 2000; 
Yatsu and Kaeriyama, 2005).  The catch of chum 
salmon in Japanese fisheries consists mainly of fish 
produced in Japan.  New information indicates that 
Japanese-produced chum salmon spend their first 
marine year in the southern Okhotsk Sea.  In the fall, 
the juveniles move into the northern North Pacific 
and the Bering Sea where most remain for 3 to 5 
years.  Maturing chum salmon begin their return 
migration about April–May and arrive at the rivers 
where they were released about August–September. 
All chum salmon die after spawning, although 
natural spawning rarely occurs in Japan. Chum 
salmon are basically zooplankton feeders.

Fishery 
Since the 1970s, the high seas salmon fishery has 
declined and in recent years has been confined to the 
Russian EEZ (Table 16).  Thus, the recent chum 
salmon catch is mainly from the coastal set net 
fishery around Hokkaido and northern Honshu.  
There is a relationship between size and age at 
maturity and abundance of chum salmon 
(Kaeriyama, 1989).  
 
Climate and ocean effects 
There are natural fluctuations in Pacific salmon 
abundance that are related to fluctuations in large- 
scale climate indices and to regime shifts (Beamish  
 
and Bouillon, 1993; Yatsu and Kaeriyama, 2005).  It 
is generally accepted now that the early assumptions 
that climate and ocean impacts on survival followed 
a random model are not correct.  However, the 
mechanisms that result in trends in production are 
poorly understood.  It is known that coastal 
environments are important.  For example, Saito 
(2002) detected positive correlations between marine 
survival rates and coastal SST in particular areas of 
Hokkaido and northern Honshu.  There is not a good 
relationship between PDO and catch for chum 
salmon produced in Japan (Kaeriyama, 2004; Yatsu 
and Kaeriyama, 2005).  Thus, marine survival of 
Japanese chum salmon is correlated more with the 
coastal environment than with the PDO or Aleutian 
Low Pressure Index.

Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) 
Biology 
Pacific saury have a life span of 2 years or less.  The 
age of the first maturation is at about 6 months. Their 
maximum size is 34 cm in body length.  Pacific 
saury are zooplankton feeders. 
 
Fishery 
Two stocks occur around Japan.  The Northwestern 
Pacific stock occurs in the northwestern Pacific from 
the Pacific coast off Japan to 170°E (Odate, 1977).  
The Japan Sea stock occurs in the Japan Sea.  Most 
catches of Pacific saury in Japan are made from the 
Northwestern Pacific stock (Table 17).  Catches from 
the Japan Sea stock are much smaller than those 
from the Pacific Ocean.  The distribution is very 
broad and includes the EEZ waters of Russia, Korea, 
and Japan.  Gong et al. (1983) reported that Pacific 
saury remain in the southern region of the Japan Sea 
and the East China Sea in winter.  The Northwestern 
Pacific stock spawns mainly in winter throughout the 
subtropical waters, including the Kuroshio and 
Kuroshio Extension, much wider areas than 
previously assumed.  They also spawn in spring and 
autumn in the KOTZ.  Baytaluk and Davydova 
(2001) reported that large numbers of larvae were 
found in the central Pacific Ocean in spring.  In this 
report we consider that the two stocks are 
geographically divided, consistent with Odate (1977) 
who suggested that the Central Pacific stock occurs 
in the central part of the North Pacific Ocean 
separately from the Northwestern Pacific stock.  
However, Nagasawa et al. (1988) stated that 
separation of the Northwestern Pacific stock and the 
Central Pacific stock is doubtful, based on the 
parasite studies.  Accordingly, it is possible that there 
is only one stock ranging from the northwestern 
Pacific to the central part of the North Pacific.   
 
Pacific saury are fished using stick-held dip-nets.  
Drift gill net fisheries and set net fisheries are used 
locally or seasonally, but account for less than 5% of 
the catch.  The fishery for the Northwestern Pacific 
stock averaged 280,000 t from 1980 to 2000  
(Table 15).  There is no apparent trend in catches. 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
The optimum SST range for hatching is from 14° to 
20°C.  The lower limit of the distribution in the 
feeding grounds is about 4°C.  The optimum SST 
range in the feeding grounds located in the subarctic 
waters, including the Oyashio, is from 8° to 12°C.  
 
Ebisawa and Snow (1999) reported that SST of the 
Kuroshio (southeast of Honshu) in winter is 
positively correlated with the catch per unit effort 
(CPUE) of the Pacific saury stick-held dip-net 
fishery.  The CPUE of large-sized saury in this 
fishery is related to SST in the winter of the previous 
2 years.  Kurita (2001) reported that the abundance 
of zooplankton in the feeding areas (the Oyashio 
waters) affected the condition of Pacific saury, which 
may influence the success of the spawning.  
However, an actual relationship between 
zooplankton abundance and the success of spawning 
has not been reported.  Tian et al. (2002) stated that 
the occurrence of El Niño and MOI (Monsoon Index) 
positively affected the abundance of Pacific saury 
(especially for large-sized fish).  Productivity is 
significantly related to the Southern Oscillation 
Index (SOI), but does not appear to be related to the 
PDO (Figs. 23 and 24) and thus, to regime shifts.  
The clear relationship to SST in the Kuroshio and 
Kuroshio Extension in winter and in their spawning 
area indicates that climate-related changes in the 
ocean will affect the production of Pacific saury.

Common squid (Todarodes pacificus) 
Biology 
Common squid is a coastal/offshore species with a 
life span of approximately 1 year and a maximum 
mantle length of 27 cm (Murata, 1990).  Although 
this species is abundant in the entire area of the Japan 
Sea, it is confined to coastal and offshore waters in 
the Pacific Ocean.  They change their prey from 
zooplankton to small fishes and squids as they grow. 
 
Fishery 
Off Japan, an autumn cohort and a winter cohort are 
recognized for management purposes.  The autumn 
cohort consists of squid hatched from October to 
December in the East China Sea and the southern 
Japan Sea (Murata, 1990).  The autumn cohort 
migrates to its feeding area around the northern Japan 
Sea and returns to its spawning grounds via the Japan 
Sea.  Extensive tagging studies have identified the 
migration pattern, and para-larval distribution 
indicates that the spawning area is in the East China 
Sea and southern Japan Sea.  The winter cohort is 
composed of squid that hatch during December to 
February in the East China Sea.  Tagging studies have 
shown that these young squid migrate to their feeding 
grounds around Hokkaido mainly via the northwestern 
Pacific (Murata, 1990).  Most of the winter cohorts 
return to their spawning grounds through the Japan 
Sea.  In general, the two cohorts have distinct hatching 
periods, season-specific body sizes, and migration 
patterns.  However, the separation is not perfect 
because of overlapping length distributions.  Thus, the 
portioning of catches using mean mantle length in the 
summer is not exact (Kidokoro, 2002).  In addition to 
Japan, the stocks are fished by Korea and China using 
jigs, trawls, purse seines, and set nets.  Proportions of 
catch by Japan and Korea in recent years are more 
than 90% (Table 18).  CPUE of commercial and 
research jig fishing can be used as a proxy of stock 
abundance.  The biomass of common squid was high 
in the 1960s, declined in the 1970s, and remained at 
74 
low levels through to the early 1990s when it 
increased substantially (Fig. 21). 
Climate and ocean effects 
In general, warmer temperature conditions around 
Japanese waters are favorable for common squid 
(Sakurai et al., 2000).  The area that is suitable for 
spawning for both stocks is considered to be a major 
factor affecting abundance (Sakurai et al., 2000).  
Hatchlings are abundant in SSTs of 17° to 23°C.  This 
temperature range, and ocean conditions favorable for 
pre-spawning behaviour and post-spawning retention 
of eggs within a mid-water layer, are important for 
year-class survival (Sakurai et al., 2000). 
 
The biomass of common squid increased in the mid- 
1980s (Fig. 21).  Productivity is positively correlated 
with winter SST along the Kuroshio path and its 
southern areas.  Abundance is negatively correlated 
to the PDO without a lag (Fig. 25).  Common squid 
and jack mackerel productivity and biomass trends 
are similar and roughly opposite to Japanese sardine 
(Figs. 26 and 27).  
Neon flying squid (Ommastrephes bartrami) 
Biology 
Neon flying squid is an oceanic species that has a life 
span of slightly longer than 1 year and that grows to 
a size of 60 cm mantle length in females and 45 cm 
in males (Yatsu et al., 1998). They are voracious 
predators of small fishes and squids. 
 
Fishery 
Two cohorts are recognized.  The winter–spring 
cohort and the autumn cohort have distinct hatching 
periods, body sizes, and migration patterns (Yatsu et 
al., 1998).  The winter–spring cohort has been the 
target of the traditional jig fishery in the 
northwestern Pacific, west of 160°E.  The autumn 
cohort is distributed mainly in the central and eastern 
North Pacific.  This cohort was the target of the 
international driftnet fishery beginning in 1978 and 
ending in 1992 by international agreement.  A new 
jig fishery on this cohort started in the mid-1990s 
throughout the western and central North Pacific.

Tagging surveys were not successful in providing 
information about the stock structure.  However, a 
study of helminth parasites identified a central North 
Pacific and an eastern North Pacific stock within the 
autumn cohort (Nagasawa et al., 1998).  The autumn 
cohort is now fished by Japan, China, and probably 
Korea and Taiwan.  Recent catch data by all 
countries may be incomplete.  CPUE from research 
driftnet studies in the early summer can be used as a 
proxy of the abundance of the Central North Pacific 
stock within the autumn cohort (Yatsu et al., 2000). 
 
Prior to the moratorium on driftnet fishing in 1992, 
catches by all countries increased steadily from the 
early 1970s to 300,000–350,000 t in the early 1980s.  
Since 1993, Japanese annual catches have ranged 
between 15,000 and 85,000 t (Table 19). 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
The SST at the spawning grounds ranges from 22° to 
26°C, as indicated by para-larval distribution (Yatsu 
et al., 2000).  SST at the feeding grounds ranges 
from 10° to 25°C, with the densest concentrations of 
squid occurring at temperatures between 15° and 
22°C (Yatsu et al., 1993).  SST should be an 
important factor affecting the spawning, survival, 
and growth of para-larvae, hence stock abundance 
(Yatsu et al., 2000).  Zooplankton mean density in 
the Central North Pacific (Sugimoto and Tadokoro, 
1998) is significantly negatively correlated to the 
research driftnet CPUE (r = – 0.57, P < 0.05, df = 
14).  SSTs in the hatching and nursery areas (30°–
36°N, 170°–150°W from October to March) and 
during pre-recruitment (30°–36°N, 170°–150°W 
from January to June) had some positive relationship 
to abundance after the moratorium on driftnet fishing 
in 1992 (Yatsu et al., 2000). 
 
 
Possible Greenhouse Gas-induced Changes 
in the Climate and Ocean Environment 
It is now recognized that natural changes in climate 
have major impacts on the abundance of marine fish.  
However, while there is a great amount of evidence 
that climate affects fish, the mechanisms that cause 
the fluctuations in abundances are not well 
understood.  We know that major climate events 
associated with ENSO (El Niño–Southern 
Oscillation) regimes, regime shifts, and 50- to 70-
year climate trends are reflected in the population 
dynamics of most fishes.  Unfortunately, we are not 
yet able to forecast accurately how global warming 
will have an impact on these natural climate 
fluctuations.  Potential impacts will change the 
strength and direction of ocean currents which will 
affect the larvae transportation and availability of 
nutrients which, in turn, will affect the food of fishes. 
 
In particular, the food for larval and juvenile fish in 
their first ocean year appears to be critical for their 
survival over the first marine winter and for their 
recruitment into commercial fisheries because 
survival rates are extremely low during larval and 
juvenile stages.  Ocean temperatures will change 
and, in most ecosystems, will warm.  Warmer 
temperatures affect metabolic functions of fish as 
well as their behaviour, food, and predators.  
Although we cannot predict accurately how the 
ocean ecosystems will change, we are improving our 
understanding and are able to make informed

speculation.  If we recognize that changes will occur 
and that our understanding of the impacts is 
imperfect, it becomes evident that our management 
of the fisheries is critical.  Overfishing at the 
beginning of a prolonged trend of poor ocean 
productivity could reduce a stock to such levels that 
literally could take centuries to recover. 
 
Changes in the climate and ocean environment over 
and around Japan as a result of global warming can 
only be approximated (Nishioka and Harasawa, 
1998).  At the time of a doubling of CO
2   
(relative to 
1990 levels) it is estimated that air temperature 
would increase between 1.0° and 2.5°C.  Sea level 
rises on the coast of the Japan Sea would be 10 to 20 
cm higher and about 15 cm higher along the Pacific 
Ocean and Okhotsk Sea coasts.  Along the coast of 
the Japan Sea, the SST increase would be 1.6°C, 1.2° 
to 1.6°C along the Pacific coast, and 1.8°C along the 
coast of the Okhotsk Sea.  The strength of the 
Kuroshio Current depends on the changes in the 
subtropical Pacific gyres.  If the temperature 
difference between higher and lower latitudes is 
reduced, trade winds and westerly winds are 
estimated to weaken.  As a consequence, the strength 
of the Oyashio and Kuroshio would weaken, and the 
mixed layer depth would become shallower, 
reducing plankton production.  There seems little 
doubt that global warming will change the path of 
the Kuroshio and the structure of the Oyashio and the 
Transition area.  However, there is another 
interpretation in which global warming impacts on 
the gyres in the subarctic Pacific could result in more 
periods of stormy winters similar to the conditions 
from 1977 to 1989 (Mote et al., 1999). 
 
According to Mote et al. (1999), over the next 100 
years there will be a trend of increasingly positive 
PDO or stormy periods according to two major GCM 
models, the UK Hadley Centre model and the 
Canadian Climate Centre model (Fig. 28;  Beamish 
and Noakes, 2002).  Also, the above two models 
predict an increase in the Arctic Oscillation (AO) in 
the next century (Fig. 29), though the two scenarios 
forecast SOI differently.  Assessment of greenhouse 
gas effects on fisheries is difficult because of the 
 
77
unexpected ecosystem dynamics, even though some 
species in the Japanese fisheries have simpler life 
histories than species such as Pacific salmon (Mote 
et al., 1999; Beamish and Noakes, 2002).  Climate 
effects will result in different impacts, depending on 
ecosystem structure – species types of prey, 
predators, competitors, and changes in their 
associations.  It is important to preserve the natural 
buffering characteristics of individual stocks (Shuter 
et al., 2002).  For example, diverse age structure, 
genetic diversity, migration pathways, and multiple 
habitats are essential for mitigating unexpected 
climate changes.  Although small pelagics around 
Japan are genetically uniform (Okazaki et al., 1996), 
their natural buffering capacity will not be easily lost 
because of their adaptability (Kuroda, 1991; 
McFarlane et al., 2002).

Ono et al. (2002) detected a decreasing trend in 
primary production in the Oyashio during the 1970–
1993 period.  If this trend continues, production of 
small pelagics and other predatory species will 
decrease in both the Kuroshio and Oyashio areas.  
This is because most of the small pelagic fishes 
around the Pacific coast of Japan utilize the productive 
Oyashio area as feeding grounds during spring–
autumn.  Shifts in the geographic range of sardine 
populations corresponding to temperature changes will 
not result in a collapse of stocks because their 
behaviour is flexible (e.g., the spawning ground for 
sardine shifted considerably around Japan; Kuroda, 
1991), and they have sustained themselves during 
changing temperatures over evolutionary time.  
  
Some of the observed shifts in biological 
productivity of sardine, chub mackerel and common 
squid correspond to regime shifts in SST (1957/58, 
1970/71, 1976/77, 1988/89; Yasunaka and Hanawa, 
2002), and in PDO (Figs. 23–26).  Biological 
productivity of Pacific saury, jack mackerel and 
walleye pollock were not evidently related to regime 
shifts; however, decadal and inter-annual fluctuations 
were observed.  For Pacific saury, this is probably 
because of the correlation of productivity with ENSO 
(Fig. 25; Tian et al., 2002).  Since biomass and 
productivity of sardine and common squid are 
negatively correlated (Fig. 27), there might be an 
inter-species competition in addition to unknown 
linkages to PDO variability.  It should also be 
remembered that an increase in biomass is a result of 
accumulation of enhanced productivity over time and 
that biological productivity may be decreased by 
increased biomass known as the density-dependent 
effect.  
 
The 1970/71 regime shift resulted in extremely high 
production rates for sardine and chub mackerel.  The 
well known 1976/77 regime shift was detected in the 
productivity and recruitment of chub mackerel, and 
possibly Pacific saury, but did not seem to affect 
sardine.  Yatsu and Kidokoro (2001) found coherent 
shifts in body size and intrinsic population growth 
rate of common squid in 1976/77 and around 1986.  
The 1989 regime shift, when the AO shifted to a 
positive phase, affected sardine and chub mackerel 
productivity and recruitment, production–biomass 
relations (Yatsu et al., 2003), and possibly jack 
mackerel recruitment. 
 
In general, peaks in biomass lag up to a decade from 
the SST regime shifts, probably because of the time 
required for biomass accumulation in response to 
shifts in the stock-specific production rates and 
fishing mortality.  Recruitment corresponds more 
closely with the SST regime shifts than with 
productivity, indicating early survival is the most 
sensitive stage in species life history to 
oceanographic changes.  Yatsu et al. (2003) argued 
that productivity is less sensitive to environmental 
variability than to recruitment, as production is the 
composite of recruitment, individual growth and 
natural mortality over a broad range of ages.  Even if 
these relationships between the PDO and AO were 
determined accurately, prediction of sardine and 
chub mackerel populations is difficult because the 
positive PDO and AO have a contradicting 
relationship to sardine and chub mackerel 
productivity.  Jack mackerel will increase, as its 
production is negatively related to the Oyashio

southern limit, which has a negative relationship with 
the PDO (Fig. 25), and geographic distribution is 
confined to central and southern Japan, i.e., jack 
mackerel seem independent of Oyashio productivity.  
Under the decreasing scenario of Oyashio 
productivity, the Pacific saury production rate will 
decrease. 
 
 
Possible Impacts of Climate Change on Fish 
Populations and Fisheries  
A summary of linkages between stock trends and 
environmental conditions for different species is 
provided in Table 20. 
Chub mackerel 
There is clear evidence that climate, and climate 
shifts, affect the production of chub mackerel.  There 
also is evidence that overfishing of immature fish 
affects the ability of the population to respond to 
periods of favourable environmental conditions.  It is 
apparent that future changes in climate will have an 
impact on production.  Warming of the spawning 
areas in the winter will have a negative impact, as 
will more intense and frequent periods of extreme 
winter storminess (more intense Aleutian Lows and a 
positive PDO). 
 
Jack mackerel 
Jack mackerel may increase in abundance as their 
productivity is negatively related to the southern 
limit of the Oyashio, which has a negative 
relationship with the PDO.   
 
Japanese sardine 
In the Tsushima Current stock, reproductive success 
is negatively affected by winter temperature in the 
southwestern Japan Sea (Hiyama et al., 1995).  A 
similar effect of winter temperature is also known in 
the Pacific stock (Ebisawa and Kinoshita, 1998; Noto 
and Yasuda, 1999). The impacts of global warming 
induced climate change on Japanese sardine will 
relate to impacts on the dynamics of the western 
gyres, including the Kuroshio, Kuroshio Extension 
and Oyashio, and the structure of the Transition area.  
If the impact results in more intense and more 
extreme winter Aleutian Lows, and thus periods of 
positive PDO, then sardine abundance would 
continue to fluctuate, perhaps with all-time record 
highs of abundance.  However, other models suggest 
that winds will be reduced, and this could result in 
periods of increased stability, reduced plankton 
productivity, and low sardine survival, typical of the 
period from the late 1940s to the mid-1970s.  
 
Anchovy 
The production of anchovy is opposite to that of 
Japanese sardine and this relationship is expected to 
continue.  Therefore, a key to understanding the 
impacts of climate change on anchovy is to look at 
the behaviour of sardine.  There is not a good 
relationship between PDO and other major ocean–
climate indices and production, but there are 
persistent trends in production that change quickly to 
opposite trends, indicating that climate and ocean 
conditions are important.  A key to the understanding 
of the impacts is the response of major atmospheric 
circulation patterns in the winter to increased 
greenhouse gas production.  If winds are reduced, 
anchovy production may be generally increased as 
sardine production is reduced.  The opposite would 
occur if there are more frequent periods of intense 
Aleutian Lows. 
 
Walleye pollock 
There is no relationship between walleye pollock 
productivity or catch and the PDO, but there ae 
decadal-scale fluctuations.  This indicates that 
climate effects are important and that there is a 
persistence in climate-related impacts on walleye 
pollock.  They are at the southern limit of their range 
around Japan and a warming of the ocean would 
reduce their productivity.  Because walleye pollock 
are also relatively long-lived (maximum ages of 
about 30 years), there is a resiliency in the population 
to prolonged unfavourable ocean conditions if the 
stocks are not overfished.  This resiliency could 
ensure that the stocks are maintained, and even 
enhanced, during the periods when naturally cold 
ocean conditions occur.   
 
Chum salmon 
Chum salmon are virtually all produced in hatcheries 
and the number of fry produced has been maintained 
at about 2 billion in recent years.  This means that 
egg-to-fry survival is independent of climate 
impacts, either directly in fresh water or indirectly in 
the regulation of the number of eggs produced (as 
would occur in naturally spawning stocks).  
80 
However, there will be an impact on chum salmon in 
the ocean during the early marine rearing period.  In 
general, Pacific salmon at their southern range in the 
ocean are expected to have reduced marine survival 
and thus, reduced production as a consequence of the 
warming of the sea surface and the reduction in 
plankton preferred by juveniles.  A reduction in food 
reduces carrying capacity and reduces production 
either by increased predation mortality or by reduced 
growth in the early marine period, and a subsequent 
reduced ability to survive harsh environmental 
conditions in the first marine winter.

Pacific saury 
The abundance trend of Pacific saury is related more 
to ENSO than to the PDO, suggesting that it is 
necessary to understand how global warming will 
change the pattern of ENSO to understand the 
impacts on Pacific saury.  Warm surface waters in 
the Kuroshio and subtropical waters south of 
Shikoku and Kyushu are associated with reduced 
recruitment.  Thus Pacific saury may be less 
abundant under a global warming scenario. 
 
Common squid 
Common squid should respond to greenhouse gas-
induced climate change in a manner similar to jack 
mackerel, and opposite to Japanese sardine.  If jack 
mackerel abundance increases because its 
productivity is negatively related to the Oyashio 
southern limit, which is negatively related to PDO, 
then common squid should also increase in a decadal 
fashion.   Common squid were reduced in abundance 
during the 1980s when the PDO was positive and the 
Aleutian Low was strong.  If there are more frequent 
periods of intense Aleutian Lows, there may be more 
frequent periods of reduced abundance of common 
squid.  Because common squid live only for 1 year, 
their abundance trends change quickly. 
 
Neon flying squid 
There is no apparent relationship to the PDO.  There 
is a relationship between SST and abundance which 
indicates that warmer surface waters may be more 
productive for neon flying squid.

The Fishery  
China has the largest fishery in the world.  The total 
production was 5.1 million t in 2005, of which 28.5% 
was from marine captures.  Catches from marine 
capture fisheries reported by the UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO) increased from 3.1 
million t in 1980 to a maximum of 17.2 million t in 
1998 and 1999 (Table 21, Fig. 30A and B).  Catches 
in 2002 declined about 4% from the 1999 levels.  
China’s marine capture fisheries have accounted for 
about 18% of the world catch in recent years  
(Table 21, Fig. 31) of which marine fish make up the 
largest group in the catch (Fig. 32).  Much of the 
catch is reported in species aggregates, such as 
marine fishes (nei), or scads (nei).  Scads include, for 
example, Trachurus japonicus, Decapterus 
maruadsi, Septipinna taty, and Sardinella zunasi.  
Some of the key species in the Yellow Sea are listed 
in Table 22 and represent about 17 to 20% of the 
catch over the past few decades. 
 
Aquaculture is the major supplier of seafood in 
China.  Production of seafood from aquaculture just 
exceeded wild production in 1985 and by 2003 was 
1.4 times larger than the wild catch.  Marine 
aquaculture consists mostly of shrimp, molluscs, and 
aquatic plants, with fish representing about 2.5% of 
the approximately 20.9 million t of marine 
aquaculture production in 2003.  A common food for 
cultured fish is the bycatch in marine fisheries. In 
2003, marine fish production was 519,000 t, and was 
expected to increase substantially.  China is also one 
of the world’s major importers of fish meal and, 
increasingly, more seafood for domestic 
consumption. 
 
Major Coastal Fishing Areas  
The major coastal fishing areas are in the Bohai Sea, 
the Yellow Sea, and the East China Sea (Fig. 33).  
The Yellow/Bohai Sea is bordered by China, 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and 
Republic of Korea, and is located at latitudes of 32°–
41°N, and longitudes of 118°–126°30 ′E. A border 
line, separating the Yellow Sea from the East China 
Sea, is commonly drawn from the mouth of the 
Yangtze River to Jeju Do.  The Yellow Sea large 
marine ecosystem, as internationally defined, also 
includes the Bohai Sea.  Major rivers discharging 
directly into the Yellow/Bohai Sea include the Han, 
Datung, Yalu, Huanghe and Sheyang, from the 
middle region to the north, and the Yangtze River in 
the south.  The Yellow Sea annually receives more 
than 1.6 billion t of sediments from the rivers 
(Valencia, 1988).  It covers an area of about 460,000 
km
2
 and has a geologically unique bottom.  The 
seafloor has an average depth of about 40 m, a 
maximum depth of 140 m north of Jeju Do, and 
slopes gently from the Chinese continent, and more 
rapidly from the Korean Peninsula to a north–south 
trend of bathymetric contour.  There is a depression 
with smooth terrain in the central part of the Yellow 
Sea which is an important overwintering ground for 
many fish species.  The Bohai Sea and the shallow 
waters along the coast in the Yellow Sea are 
important spawning grounds for most species 
distributed in the Yellow Sea.  The Bohai, Yellow 
and East China seas are marginal seas of the Pacific 
Ocean bounded by the Korean Peninsula and China.  
The Yellow Sea is a semi-enclosed shelf sea with 
distinct bathymetry, hydrography, productivity, and 
trophically dependent populations.  Shallow, but rich 
 
 
86 
in nutrients and resources, the sea is most favourable 
for coastal and offshore fisheries, and has had well-
developed multi-species and multi-national fisheries.  
However, over the past several decades, many 
changes in productivity, biomass yields, species 
composition and shift in dominance have occurred.  
Overexploitation is the principal reason for the 
changing state of the ecosystem, but natural 
environmental perturbation should be considered an 
important driving force causing changes in the 
species composition and biomass yields, at least for 
pelagic species and shellfish. 
  
The Yellow Sea is one of the most intensively fished 
areas in the world. China has increased the total 
annual catch from about 0.5 million t in the 1950s 
and 1960s to around 1.5 million t in recent years.  
Four provinces and one municipality, including 
Lioaning, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Tianjin are 
along the Chinese coast in the Yellow Sea.

The Yellow Sea contains an abundance of living 
marine resources. There are about 300 fish species, 
41 crustaceans, and 20 cephalopods, but only around 
50 species are represented in the fishery.  Warm- 
water species dominate, accounting for 46.7%, with 
temperate water species making up 44.7%.  Only a 
few cold water water species are found in the area.  
Tang et al. (2003) provide a detailed account of the 
changes in the major fisheries resources in the Bohai 
Sea (Table 22).

Climate 
The climate system of the Yellow Sea and East 
China Sea is strongly affected by processes in the 
Northwest Pacific Subtropical High system through 
the Kuroshio Current and the land climate system.  
The Asian monsoon is dominant in the summer, and 
the northern cold air system is important in the 
winter months.  Therefore, the long-term variation in 
the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea is complex.  
Both seas share the same climate system.  Air 
temperature over the area has followed a warming 
trend since 1956.  A negative temperature anomaly 
period occurred from 1956 to 1987, followed by a 
positive anomaly until 1998.  Since 1998, it appears 
 
that there is a negative temperature anomaly.  Wang 
et al. (1998) considered that air temperature patterns 
differ from large-scale global patterns because of the 
influence of climate over the land.  There was a 
warming of the Yellow Sea sea surface from 1989 
until 2000, when a cooling period began.  In general, 
there has been a warming trend since 1968,  with an 
increase in sea surface temperature of 0.27°C per 
decade and 0.12°C per decade at 50 m depth.  In the 
East China Sea there has been a decadal pattern in 
the coastal sea surface temperatures.  In general, the 
1960s were cool, the 1970s warm, the 1980s cool, 
and the 1990s warm, with a maximum occurring 
around 1998.  Temperature increases in coastal areas 
were larger than in offshore areas.

Key Species in the Fishery 
Small yellow croaker  (Pseudosciaena polyactis) 
Biology 
Small yellow croaker is warm-temperature bottom 
fish that is distributed in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea 
and East China Sea (Zhao et al., 1990).  Three 
geographical stocks, the northern stock, the Lüsi 
stock, and East China Sea stock, are recognized (Liu, 
1990). The northern stock migrates seasonally 
between the central southern Yellow Sea during 
winter and northern part of the Yellow Sea and 
Bohai Sea from spring to autumn.  The Lüsi stock is 
the largest and is distributed in the southern Yellow 
Sea.  It migrates seasonally, often only short 
distances, mainly between shallow and deep waters 
in the southern Yellow Sea.  The East China Sea 
stock only migrates in the East China Sea waters. 
 
In the Yellow Sea small yellow croaker mainly over-
winter in water depths of 60 to 80 m.  Water 
temperatures range from 8° to 15°C and salinity 
varies from 33 to 34 psu.  Spawning grounds are 
usually in the estuaries where the salinity is affected 
by river runoff.  Small yellow croakers start their 
spawning migration from the wintering grounds in 
March, and spawn in the shallow coastal waters of 10 
to 20 m depth from April to May, mostly along the 
Chinese coastal waters.  In the 1950s and 1960s, 
about 0.5 to 3% of 1-year-old fish were mature and 
most fish matured at 2 years.  However, most fish 
have matured at 1 year since the mid-1970s.  The 
fecundity of small yellow croaker is from 32,000 to 
72,000 eggs per fish at age 2 to 4 years and from 
83,000 to 125,000 eggs per fish at age 5 to 9 years.  
Population parameters of small yellow croaker in the 
northern area during April surveys from 1955 to 
1998 are presented in Table 23. 
  
Small yellow croaker is a slow growing species with 
a long life span, and a maximum recorded age of 23 
years (Liu, 1990).  The northern stock in the waters 
off northern Shandong Peninsula in spring is 
comprised of fish migrating into the spawning 
grounds of the Bohai Sea from the wintering grounds 
of the central Yellow Sea. This population has been 
traditionally fished by fishermen from northern 
China in April.  During the late 1950s, the length 
composition in catches ranged from 19.7 to 21.9 cm 
in mean body length and 150 to 199 g in mean body 
weight, and consisted mainly of age groups from 2 to 
5 years. Fish below 16 cm in body length, being 
mostly immature, occupied only a small proportion 
of the spawners in the 1950s. From 1955 to 1957  
this proportion was only 1.0 to 3.9%, increasing 
slightly in 1958 and 1959 because of the great 
exploitation pressure in 1957. Consequently, the 
proportion of young fish increased in the spawning 
population after 1957 (Liu, 1960).  Meanwhile, fish 
over 20 cm body length accounted for 51.2 to 85.8% 
of the population. Therefore, the older fish, which 
could repeat spawning, became the major source of 
spawners, indicating that the stock was not out of 
equilibrium.   After about three decades of heavy 
exploitation, the population structure changed. 
Compared to the 1950s, the fish size of the northern 
area stock in the 1980s was smaller, only 15.1 to 
16.6 cm in mean body length and 59 to 80 g in mean 
body weight (Table 23). The smallest mean fish size 
in the 1980s occurred in 1985, and increased slightly 
in 1986. During the surveys of the 1980s, the number 
of small yellow croaker below 16 cm body length 
accounted for 54.3 to 76.5%, and those larger than 20 
cm accounted for 8.5 to 17.2% of the catch.  This 
trend was almost opposite to the situation observed 
in the 1950s. Only 8.5% over 20 cm, 15% in the 
range of 17 to 19 cm, and the rest below 16 cm in 
body length were found in the catch of 1985. Thus, 
only a minor proportion of the stock may be able to 
spawn more than once before being caught. 
  
The mean length of the spawning population of the 
Lüsi stock in spring is shown in Table 24.  During 
the 1950s and 1960s, the mean length of the stock 
ranged from 20.0 to 24.4 cm, with a corresponding 
mean body weight of 140 to 318 g and mean age of 
3.8 to 6.3 years, older than observed for the northern 
stock.  In the 1970s, the number of older fish 
decreased with a corresponding increase in fishing 
intensity, which affected the whole structure of the 
stock.  Mean body length declined to 17.9 cm with a 
mean body weight of 102 g and a mean age of 2.4 
years.  In the 1980s, the structure of the spawning 
population continued to change.  Fish in the catches 
of the Lüsi stock in the main distribution area 
averaged only 14.7 cm in length, 55 g in body weight 
and had a mean age just exceeding 1 year.  The catch 
in 1985 had a mean length of only 12.7 cm and 35 g 
in mean body weight, increasing in 1986, but then 
decreasing to the smallest values ever recorded in 
1987 and 1988 (Table 24).  The Lüsi spawning stock 
in the spring was comprised of mainly 1- to 2-year-
old fish, of which the 1-year-olds were dominant.  
Older fish were rarely caught in the 1980s.  
Therefore, in recent years the spring fishery has been 
highly dependent on recruiting year classes. 
92 
Fishery 
The population which was distributed in the 
wintering grounds (far from shore) was rarely fished 
in the 1950s because of small-sized fishing boats and 
rough seas.  However, with improvements to fishing 
vessels and gear technology, fishermen can now fish 
in all areas of the Yellow Sea year round, so that 
small yellow croaker is also fished/exploited heavily 
during the winter months.  
 
Small yellow croaker in the Yellow and Bohai seas 
were mainly exploited by China, Japan and Korea in 
the 1950s and 1960s.  Since the 1980s, this species 
has been fished mainly by China and Korea.  In 
China, small yellow croaker are caught mostly by the 
three northernmost provinces (Shandong, Liaoning

catches are also taken by the Jiangsu province and 
Shanghai in the mid-eastern part of China. 
 
Figure 34 shows the fluctuation in catch of small 
yellow croaker by northern China from 1950 to 1998 
(Jin, 1996a,b).  This catch might be slightly different 
from the actual catch from the Yellow and Bohai 
Seas due to the incomplete statistics, but it reflects 
the variation in catch of small yellow croaker in the 
Yellow and Bohai Seas during this period.  The yield 
of small yellow croaker increased nearly linearly in 
the 1950s, and tended to decline in the 1960s, 
reaching the lowest level in 1972.  Since then, the 
catch has varied with several small peaks, but 
increased continuously in the 1990s, perhaps 
indicating a trend of increased productivity.  
 
During the 1960s, the total fishing power of northern 
China, as reflected by the increased horse power of 
motor boats, expanded by more than three times.  
Motorboat horsepower in the 1970s and 1980s 
increased 10 times and 24.5 times, respectively, 
compared to the 1950s.  Although the fishing effort 
cannot be proportionately allocated to small yellow 
croaker, the fishing pressure has undoubtedly risen 
considerably.

Fig. 34 Variations in catch of small yellow croaker from northern China from 1950 to 1998. 
 
 
The proportion of small yellow croaker in the catches 
of marine fishes in northern China varied from 
14.0% in the 1950s to 7.6% in the 1960s, 1.2% in the 
1970s, and 2% in the 1980s.  The proportion 
increased in the 1990s, indicating that the species 
productivity may have started to improve. 
 
Ocean and climate effects 
Small yellow croaker is a bottom fish that also 
spawns on the bottom.  Kim et al. (1997) showed 
that cold temperatures at 75 m depth were associated 
with reduced productivity and weak year classes.  
From 1989 through to 2000, there was a warming 
period in the Yellow Sea, after which a cooling 
period began.  It is difficult to assess the impact of 
ocean and climate changes in the species.  Small 
yellow croaker is a migratory fish with a wide 
temperature range, and abundance data are obtained 
from the fishery which depends on fishing effort. 
  
There was no indication of major environmental 
changes in the Yellow Sea in the 1980s when catches 
declined to one-sixth of those in the 1960s (Tang, 
1993), which suggests that the decreases resulted 
from excessive fishing.  Despite these drops and very 
high fishing effort, there was a recovery of the catch 
in the 1990s, suggesting that trends in the ocean 
environment were associated with the increased 
abundance. 
Anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) 
Biology 
Anchovy is a small inshore pelagic species that is 
widely distributed in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and 
East China Sea.  There may be at least two stocks in 
these areas: Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea stock and 
East China Sea stock (Zhu and Iversen, 1990).  
Anchovy migrate seasonally with changes of sea 
surface temperature. The optimum temperature 
ranges from 10° to 13°C, and the anchovy is not 
usually found in waters below 7°C (Iversen et al., 
1993).  In November and December, the densest 
areas of distribution are in the northern and central 
parts of the Yellow Sea.  During winter anchovy 
migrate to the southeastern region of the Yellow Sea 
and northern part of the East China Sea. In spring, as 
water temperatures increase and anchovy gonads 
develop, the fish migrate into shallow coastal waters 
for spawning, and then disperse for feeding, moving 
into deeper southern waters. After November, there 
are very few anchovy left in the Bohai Sea. Dense 
schools are observed in the southeastern Yellow Sea 
and northern East China Sea.  Anchovy also migrate 
diurnally, depending on the light and water 
temperatures.  They usually appear in dense schools 
near the bottom during the daytime, and remain 
scattered in the upper to surface layers at night.

Spawning areas are in the nearshore waters and bays 
along the Chinese coast.  The three major spawning 
areas are:  bays in the Bohai Sea, nearshore waters 
off the southern tip of the Shandong Peninsula, and 
off the Zhejiang (East China Sea) coast (Zhang, 
1983; Zhu and Iversen, 1990).  The age of anchovy 
at first maturity is 1 year. Fecundity ranges from 600 
to 13,600 eggs per female. 
  
According to the surveys by the R/V Bei Dou from 
1984 to 1988 (Zhu and Iversen, 1990), the spawning 
season of anchovy is from May to October.  The 
peak spawning period is from mid-May to late June, 
with the optimum spawning temperatures from 14° 
to 18°C in the Yellow Sea. One- to 2-year-old fish 
dominate the spawning stock. Ovulation can be of 
the multi-peak or continual type, within a year, i.e., 
ovulation occurs as the eggs ripen, without an 
obvious resting stage in between (Li, 1987). 
  
There are some feeding differences between 
juveniles (0 age group) and adults. The diet of 
juvenile anchovy is dominated by copepoda (55% by 
weight; Chen, 1978; Zhu, 1991). As the anchovy 
grow, the dominant prey gradually shifts to the arrow 
worm Sagitta crassa, copepod Calanus pacificus, 
amphipod Themisto gracilipes, euphasiid Euphausia 
pacifica, and some algae. 
  
The length of anchovy at hatching ranges from 2.6 to 
2.9 mm (Zhao et al., 1990).  Zhang (1983) reported 
that the body length was 3.2 mm after hatching, and 
at a body length of 18.5 mm (length at 
metamorphosis), it becomes an adult. Five months 
after spawning, the length reaches 60 to 90 mm. The 
growth rate is higher for the 1-year-old group, and is 
reduced with age (Zhu and Iversen, 1990).  The 
maximum life span is about 4 years (Iverson et al., 
1993).  Anchovy are prey for 30 to 40 important 
higher trophic level species (Tang and Ye, 1990). 
 
Fishery 
Anchovy used to be an undesired species for the 
Chinese fishery because of its low market value.  In 
the past, only post-larvae and juveniles were used by 
some coastal artisan fishermen for dried food.  In the 
1960s, the catch was very small, about 750 to 1000 t 
in the northern Yellow Sea.  In recent years, a 
dramatic increase in biomass occurred in the Yellow 
Sea and northern East China Sea.  The stock seemed 
to be stable and was estimated by acoustic surveys to 
be about 2.5 to 4.2 million t (Zhu and Iversen, 1990) 
from 1985 to 1995.  A potential annual catch was on 
the order of 0.5 million t (Iversen et al., 1993). In 
1989, a pair-trawler anchovy fishery started and 
expanded quickly into a large-scale, year-round 
fishery in the mid-1990s.  Since then, there has been 
a rapid decline and by 2001–2002, the abundance 
was less than 10% of its peak level in 1993, which 
was estimated to be 4,120,000 t (Zhao et al., 2003). 
  
The annual anchovy catch in China varied between 
30,000 and 190,000 t between 1989 and 1992.  It 
rapidly increased to 600,000 t in 1996, more than 
1 million t in 1997 and 1998, and has decreased 
thereafter (Fig. 35). Intense fishing, increasing yearly 
by 20 to 83% in catch in the Yellow Sea before 1999, 
must have affected the spawning stock because the 
fishery has shown a considerable increase in the 
proportion of 1-year-old fish.  More than 90% of the 
catch from the Yellow Sea was recruitment from the 
spring of 1998, and acoustic surveys show that the 
stock is now almost collapsed (Jin et al., 2001). 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
There is evidence that the abundances of Japanese 
anchovy and Japanese sardine follow opposite 
trends.  This indicates that ocean conditions are 
responsible for the shifts in trends from one species 
to another.  Kim (1992) proposed that the 
distribution of anchovy eggs and larvae in June is 
related to the ocean conditions in the eastern waters 
off Korea.  Ocean conditions that favour the 
transportation of anchovy eggs and larvae into 
productive coastal areas in the summer also favour 
anchovy survival and growth. 
 
Spanish mackerel  (Scomberomorus niphonius) 
Biology 
Spanish mackerel are widely distributed in the 
northwestern Pacific Ocean.  They are abundant in 
the Bohai, Yellow, and East China seas.  The species 
undergoes long-distance seasonal migration.  There 
are two wintering stocks, one in the southeastern 
Yellow Sea, and the other located offshore of the 
East China Sea (28°00 ′–31°20 ′N, 123°40′–
125°30′E).  The stock in the East China Sea spawns 
from April to May, mainly in the coastal waters 
between Fujian (southeast China) and the Shandong 
Peninsula.  The other stock spawns from May to June 
in the Bohai Sea and the northern Yellow Sea (Wei, 
1991). After spawning, Spanish mackerel feed in

coastal waters.  The distribution of this species is 
strongly influenced by water temperature.  They 
migrate southward with decreasing temperatures.  In 
November, they are distributed mainly in the central 
and southern Yellow Sea and in December, return to 
their wintering grounds. 
 
Spanish mackerel mature at 1 to 2 years in the 
Yellow and Bohai seas.  They spawn mostly in the 
bays of the Bohai Sea, although some spawn along 
the coast of Shandong Peninsula.  The major 
spawning season is from May to June, depending on 
the water temperature.  Spawning occurs at a depth 
of 15 to 30 m.  The water temperature of the 
spawning areas differs greatly between the northern 
and southern waters, ranging from 9° to 13° C in the 
Bohai Sea and 11° to 20°C in the southern East 
China Sea, whereas the salinity is similar throughout, 
ranging from 28 to 31 psu (Zhang, 1983; Wei, 1991).  
Fecundity is about 280,000 to 1.1 million  eggs per 
female.  
  
Spanish mackerel are believed to have strong 
piscivorous habits. Small pelagic fish, such as 
Japanese anchovy and sardines, account for about 
90% of the total weight of their stomach contents 
(Tang and Ye, 1990).  Japanese anchovy make up the 
larger portion and have been referred to as “food of  
 
Spanish mackerel” by Chinese fishermen.  The size 
of prey increases with the growth of Spanish 
mackerel, but the prey composition does not vary 
significantly. 
 
At hatching Spanish mackerel measure from 4.3 to 
5.0 mm in fork length (Zhao et al., 1990). Their 
growth rate is the fastest recorded among pelagic 
fishes in the Yellow and Bohai seas.  Ocean age 0 
fish can reach 25 to 30 cm in fork length and weigh 
200 to 400 g at the time of spawning.  Females grow 
faster than males, with an average increase in length 
of 26.1%, compared with 21.9% for males in the 
second year after spawning (Wei, 1991). 
 
Fishery 
Spanish mackerel are the largest fishable pelagic fish 
in the Yellow and Bohai seas.  In autumn, there is no 
obviously dominant length group, as fork length can 
range from 20 to 54 cm.  Ocean age 0 fish account 
for 99.7% of the catch.  Mean lengths have decreased 
since the mid-1960s, indicating an increased 
proportion of young fish.  Age 1 fish accounted for 
only 1 to 7% during the period from 1952 to 1969, 
increased to 10–27% in the 1970s, and further 
increased to about 36–56% in the beginning of the 
1980s (Wei, 1991).

Catch (t)
 
Fig. 36 Chinese catch (t) of Spanish mackerel from 1980 to 2002  (FAO, 2003). 
 
 
Spanish mackerel are caught mainly by gillnet in 
China, and are a bycatch in other fisheries.  The 
annual catch increased rapidly in the 1960s and 
ranged from 20,000 to 40,000 t.  Two-year-old fish 
dominated the catch (about 75%), and the total 
mortality was about 65% (Wei, 1991).  By the mid- 
1970s, the catch was taken mainly from the 
spawning stock in spring.  Thereafter, the increase in 
fishing effort and the large quantity of age 0 fish 
caught by trawlers in autumn have resulted in a 
decline of spring catch.  Total catches from northern 
China fisheries have continuously increased in recent 
years, reaching more than 500,000 t (Fig. 36).  Since 
the mid-1990s, the catches have occurred mainly in 
the autumn, following the summer fishing closure. 
Climate and ocean effects 
It is difficult to identify a relationship between 
climate, the ocean, and productivity because of the 
lack of time series data. 
Pacific herring  (Clupea pallasii) 
Biology 
Pacific herring is a local stock that only inhabits the 
central to northern regions of the Yellow Sea (north 
of 34°N; Ye et al., 1980).  There was a small stock 
found in the 1950s which became widely distributed 
in the Yellow Sea from the late 1960s onward.  The 
wintering ground is in the central, deep water of the 
Yellow Sea.  In February the adult population 
migrates toward coastal waters off the Shandong 
Peninsula for spawning, and then moves into the 
central and northern Yellow Sea for feeding.  In 
winter the stock is distributed mainly in the central 
part of the Yellow Sea (Tang, 1991). 
 
Spawning begins in February in very shallow waters 
(3 to 7 m) along the coast and bays around the 
Shandong Peninsula, with a small group of herring 
spawning on the banks in the northern Yellow Sea 
and off western Korea.  The main spawning season is 
from March to April.  Water temperatures of 0° to 
5°C and salinity around 30 psu are required for 
spawning (Zhang, 1983).  The eggs stick together 
and adhere to reefs, algae, and other substances 
(Tang, 1980).  Hatching time decreases with 
increased temperature, from about 12–14 days at 
5.5°–10°C to 7–8 days at 15°–20°C (Jiang and Chen, 
1981; Zhang, 1983).  According to observations on 
artificial hatching and embryonic development of 
Yellow Sea herring (Jiang and Chen, 1981), the body 
length of newly hatched larvae ranges from 5.2 to 
6.8 mm.  After 4 to 5 days, they reach 7.2 to 7.8 mm, 
 
97
and after 12 to 13 days, attain a length of 9.9 to 11.2 
mm. The growth rate is fastest during summer, 
accounting for 43% of the total yearly growth, and 
decreases during autumn (Tang, 1991). 
  
The feeding period is mainly from April to August, 
and Euphausia pacifica constitutes more than 99% of 
the total stomach contents by weight in Pacific 
herring in the Yellow Sea (Wei and Jiang, 1992).    
During the rest of the year they feed little or not at 
all. 
  
During the spring survey in 1986, the fork length of 
the spawning stock of Yellow Sea herring ranged 
from 13 to 30 cm, with a mean length of 20.8 cm.  
There were two peaks in the length distribution, one 
at 18–19 cm and one at 23–24 cm, which accounted 
for 38.8% and 30.9% of 1- and 2-year-old fish, 
respectively. However, when the stock was very 
abundant during the period from 1970 to 1974, the 
mean age of the catch was 2.5 years and the fork 
length and body weight averaged 22.8 cm and 134 g, 
respectively. Fish 4 years old and older accounted for 
15.6%, and decreased to 1.5% in the period from 
1975 to 1982 (Liu, 1990). This demonstrates that the 
spawning stock at present depends mainly on the 2-
year-old age group. In autumn, the length 
composition of herring was dominated by the 21–22 
cm group, accounting for 67.2% by number, and 
9.3% of the catch was age 0 fish. 
 
Fishery 
The Yellow Sea herring fishery has experienced two 
peaks in history (around 1900 and 1938), followed 
by a period of little or no catch (Tang, 1993).  Since 
1967, many demersal stocks in the Yellow Sea have 
been overfished or depleted.  Recovery and outburst 
of the Yellow Sea herring seems to be associated 
with the depletion of other stocks.  The catch of 
Yellow Sea herring increased rapidly to a peak (more 
than 180,000 t) in 1972, and decreased sharply 
thereafter.  Tang (1981, 1993) demonstrated that 
although the fluctuations in recruitment of the 
Yellow Sea herring have been very large and have 
 
had a direct effect on the fishable stock, there is no 
strong relationship between spawning stock and 
recruitment.  Environmental conditions, such as 
rainfall, wind, and daylight, are major factors 
affecting the fluctuations in recruitment, and long-
term changes in biomass may be correlated with a 
36-year cycle of the wetness oscillation in eastern 
China (Tang, 1993).  Undoubtedly, high fishing 
pressure speeds up the depletion.  During a period of 
declining stock size, the spawning stock must be kept 
above the biologically safe level.  The abundance of 
adult fish is currently reduced to a very low level, 
and there is no longer a fishery of this stock in the 
Yellow Sea. 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
Tang (1981, 1987, 1995) found that there was no 
strong relationship between the size of the spawning 
stock and subsequent recruitment.  Similar 
observations have been made for other Pacific 
herring populations.  It was observed that rainfall, 
wind, and daylight affect recruitment.  There is also a 
relationship between periods of abundance and a 36-
year cycle of dryness and wetness which is 
associated with the Southern Oscillation.  The trends 
in Pacific herring catch ae also similar to catches of 
chub mackerel (Tang, 1995), indicating that ocean 
conditions affecting Pacific herring recruitment may 
occur in trends.  It is believed (Ye, 1985) that 
environmental conditions have an important 
influence on the long-term productivity of chub 
mackerel. 
 
Pacific herring abundances tend to be controlled by 
predation and productivity, the so-called “wasp-
waist” relationship.  If there is abundant food for 
larval herring, there may be strong year classes.  If 
favourable ocean conditions also produce predators 
of herring, then the abundances are smaller.  
Recognizing that these effects may occur, it is also 
important to recognize that overfishing is an 
important cause of the collapse of herring in the 
Yellow Sea.

The Fishery 
There are 300 to 400 fish species in the marine 
waters around Korea of which over 100 species are 
of commercial value.  Korean fisheries yield over 
1 million t of marine fish from the waters annually.  
In general, the increase in fishing activities since the 
1970s has reduced fish populations.  UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization records (FAO, 2000) 
indicate that total catches of marine fish and 
invertebrates averaged 1,565,973 t from 1980 to  
2000.  The largest catch of 2,056,521 t occurred in 
1986 (Fig. 37).  Catches were relatively stable from 
1987 to about 1996, and have decreased slightly in 
recent years. 
 
Catches in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea 
were 210,000 t in the early 1960s. However, they 
grew rapidly and have exceeded 1 million t since the 
mid-1970s.  Total catches started to decrease after 
1986 when they reached around 1.5 million t.  
Recently catches have been about 1 million t (Fig. 38).

From 1980 to 2000, catches in demersal fishes 
decreased, and increased in pelagic fishes and 
invertebrates (Fig. 39).  Demersal fish used to be 
abundant in Korean waters and were especially 
predominant on the Korean side of the Yellow Sea 
and the East China Sea in the 1960s (Zhang and 
Kim, 1999).  In addition to the decrease in 
abundance, the size of spawning demersal fish has 
continuously decreased.  The abundance of small 
pelagic fish has increased in the Tsushima Warm 
Current system.  For example, Japanese anchovy 
(anchovy hereafter) are widely distributed in the 
northwestern Pacific Ocean as demersal fish 
abundance decreased, and are one of the most 
abundant pelagic species in the Yellow Sea and the 
East China Sea.  Chinese research surveys in the

winters between 1986 and 1995 indicated that 
anchovy biomass fluctuated between 2.5 to 4.3 
million t in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea.  
However, recent overexploitation and natural 
decreases appear to have caused the depletion of 
anchovy stocks on the Chinese side of the Yellow 
Sea.  Other small pelagic fish, including the common 
squid, have tended to increase, occupying about 70% 
of the total catch of Korean marine fisheries.  
 
The seven major target species in the Yellow Sea 
during the last 40 years are: (1) largehead hairtail 
(hairtail hereafter), (2) corvenia, (3) anchovy,  
(4) small yellow croaker, (5) blenny, (6) pomfret, 
and (7) flounder.  Species composition in the catch  
 
has changed remarkably during the 1960s to 1990s. 
Hairtail were most dominant, followed by small 
yellow croaker in the 1960s and 1970s.  Thereafter, 
the catch of small yellow croaker decreased while 
corvenia, flounder, and anchovy increased in the 
1980s and 1990s (Fig. 40). 
 
The seven major target species in the East China Sea 
during the last 40 years are:  (1) anchovy, (2) chub 
mackerel, (3) threadsail filefish (filefish hereafter), 
(4) hairtail, (5) Japanese sardine, (6) corvenia, and 
(7) common squid.  Anchovy, hairtail, and small 
yellow croaker dominated in the 1960s, but the catch 
of small yellow croaker almost disappeared from the 
composition after the 1960s.  The relative

compositions of chub mackerel, filefish, and sardine 
increased in the 1970s and the 1980s. In the 1990s, 
filefish and sardine disappeared and anchovy, chub 
mackerel, and common squid dominated the 
composition (Fig. 40).  
 
Around 350 to 400 fish species reside in the 
East/Japan Sea (which also is called the Japan/East 
Sea, the East Sea, the Sea of Japan, or the Japan 
Sea).  In the waters of the northern Korean 
Peninsula, demersal species represent 75% of all 
species and the ratio of demersal species decrease to 
45% in the waters of the southern Korean Peninsula.  
Pelagic fish are greater in the south than in the north.  
Total commercial catch by neighboring nations in the 
East/Japan Sea peaked in 1983, reaching 3.3 
million t.  Korean catches, however, ranged from 
132,000 t in 1967 to 275,000 t in 1982.  The major 
species were common squid, walleye pollock (also 
called Alaska pollock, pollock hereafter), and saury, 
though large fluctuations on the decadal scale have 
appeared during the last four decades. 
 
Commercial catches in the East/Japan Sea indicate 
changes in species composition (Fig. 41).  The 
ecological shift between small pelagic fish and 
demersal fish is especially evident in accordance 
with the climate regime shift. In the 1960s, common 
squid catch occupied 43% of the catch in the 
East/Japan Sea, followed by Pacific saury (15%) and 
pollock (13%).  Pollock increased, accounting for 
33% from the 1970s to the 1980s.  Concurrently, the 
proportions of common squid and saury greatly 
decreased in the 1970s and the 1980s.  The dominant 
fisheries catch also shifted from saury, cod, and 
pollock in the 1980s to squid in the 1990s (Park et 
al., 1998).  Common squid became the dominant 
species (45%), and pollock and saury occupied less 
than 5%.  However, knowledge concerning the 
East/Japan Sea and its relationship to the regime shift 
has been very limited.  Thus there is a strong 
possibility that an increase in the squid catch is 
closely associated with changes in the lower trophic 
levels, such as zooplankton biomass and community 
structure.  
 
The trophic levels of fishery resources in the catches 
from Korean waters showed a significant decreasing 
trend from 1967 to 2000 (Fig. 42).  Mean trophic 
levels were 3.43 and 3.46 in the Yellow Sea and the 
East China Sea, respectively, during the 1967 –2000 
period.  Figure comparison shows that the slope of 
the declining line was steeper in the Yellow Sea than 
in the East China Sea.  Because of the decrease of 
demersal fish such as small yellow croaker, which 
are at higher trophic levels, small pelagic fish such as 
anchovy, common squid, and blenny, which were at 
relatively lower trophic levels, increased during the 
four decades.

Regime shifts particularly affect the production of 
major small pelagic fish.  Different fishing grounds 
of common mackerel, horse mackerel, and sardine 
were found between pre- and post-climatic regime 
shifts.  There were many changes in the East/Japan 
Sea ecosystem after the 1976/77 regime shift, as seen 
through changes in the marine environment.  In the 
East/Japan Sea, the mean trophic level increased 
from 3.09 to 3.28 during the 1976/77 regime shift 
period (Zhang et al., 2004). 
 
Climate and Ocean Influences 
The Korean Peninsula is surrounded by the Yellow 
Sea to the west, the East China Sea to the south, and 
the East/Japan Sea to the east. Large-scale air–sea 
interaction in the Pacific Ocean is the main driving 
force controlling the climate over the Korean 
Peninsula.  Some effects of climatic events, such as 
global warming, atmospheric circulation patterns, 
climate regime shifts in the North Pacific, and El 
Niños in tropical Pacific waters occasionally appear 
in this region (Kang et al., 2000; Kim and Kang, 
2000; Zhang et al., 2000; Zhang and Lee, 2001).  
 
The Korean Peninsula is located where the Siberian 
High and the subtropical Pacific Low collide, 
producing cold, dry winters and warm, wet summers.  
North and northwest winds in the autumn and winter 
are strong, and wind speeds easily reach 10 m s
–1
.  
(a) 
(b) 
α = 
106 
Winds reverse direction and become weaker in the 
spring and summer.  Typhoons developed in the 
western subtropical Pacific bring heavy rains in the 
summer and autumn.  On the average, about nine 
typhoons pass through the region every year (Kim 
and Khang, 2000).  
 
The coastal zone serves as spawning and nursery 
grounds for fish species, and the survival of some 
migratory species are threatened by coastal 
development.  The main threat to the coastal habitats 
is land reclamation, especially in estuaries and shallow 
bays.  During the 1987–1997 period, approximately 
25% of the total tidal flats were lost to reclamation in 
Korea (Cho, 2001).  The loss of spawning grounds, 
and habitat degradation due to pollutants, are also 
reducing the productivity of the coastal area.  
 
Changes in the sea surface layer in the spring have a 
profound effect on productivity.  There has been a 
1.8°C increase in sea surface temperature (SST) in 
February in the Korean seas during the past 100 
years (Hahn, 1994).  The rate of change has become 
greater during the past decade.  Hahn (1994) also 
showed that there was a northward movement of 
isothermals during the same period (Fig. 43).  Aside 
from the long-term view of global warming, SST is 
closely related to the variation of the Asian monsoon.  
The SST change over Korean waters is also 
connected to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation 
(ENSO), with phase lags of 5 to 9 months (Park and 
Oh, 2000) which results in a cold summer in the 
East/Japan Sea after an El Niño winter.  
 
In the surface layer of the East/Japan Sea, warm 
water masses were prevalent during the 1960s to 
1975, cold ones from 1976 to 1986, and warm ones 
again since 1987 (Fig. 44).  This phenomenon was 
typical in the spring and the autumn and showed a 
similar trend, with an exception from 100 to 200 m 
depth during the late 1970s.  It is also anticipated that 
changes of SST due to climate variability could 
change the pattern of frontal and current systems in 
the East/Japan Sea.  
 
Since the early 1990s, high SSTs have prevailed in 
the East/Japan Sea.  Concurrently, zooplankton 
biomass and catch of warm-water pelagic species 
(e.g., squids, jellyfish, mackerels) have increased.  
Recently, the occurrence of warm-water species has 
been frequently reported, while cold-water species 
(e.g., pollock) have decreased.  The returning rate of 
chum salmon, which were released from the east 
coast of the Korean Peninsula, has been depressed.  
As long as the warming trend of SST continues, 
more warm-water species (also less cold-water 
species) are expected to be found in Korean waters. 
 
The spatial distribution of seawater temperature 
indicated that the isotherms were perpendicular to the 
coastline at the surface.  Those lines, however, became 
parallel at 50–100 m depth.  Especially, during the 
spring from 1976 to 1986, cold temperatures were 
prevalent near coastal areas.  Warming of seawater was 
frequently observed from the late 1980s.  The vertical 
structure of temperature represented the cold regime 
lower than 11°C in the 0 to 100 m layer during the 
1977–1983 period.  Temperatures warmer than 11°C 
were common after 1989.  
 
General Description of Ecosystem Status 
and Fisheries Trends 
Changes in Ecosystem Components 
In the East/Japan Sea, there was a major change in 
the ecosystem structure and productivity from 1960 
to 1990.  The mixed layer depth increased from 1977 
and fluctuated around depths about 40% deeper than 
prior to 1976 (Zhang et al., 2000).  The mean 
transparency depth from Secchi disk observations 
showed 11.9 m during the 1960–1975 period, but 
increased to 14.2 m during the 1976–1990 period.  
This resulted in higher primary productivity (and 
consequently the zooplankton biomass) appearing in 
the earlier period (Kang et al., 2000).  Correlation 
studies indicate that some fish (saury and sandfish) 
predominated the catches when the Southern 
Oscillation Index (SOI) was positive (i.e., la Niña 
period), when spring chlorophyll was high, when air 
temperatures were cooler in coastal cities, and when 
catches were low for other fish species (sardine and 
pollock) (Kang et al., 2000; unpublished ms).  
 
Some resident fish species are found near the coast, 
while others show a long-range migration behavior 
during the course of spawning.  Kim (2003) identified 
three important ecosystems in Korean waters based on 
marine commercial fish catches (Fig. 45):  the demersal 
ecosystem in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, 
the pelagic ecosystem in the Tsushima Warm Current 
(i.e., a branch of the Kuroshio) from the East China Sea 
to the East/Japan Sea, and the demersal ecosystem in 
the northern part of the East/Japan Sea.  Most species in 
these categories generally showed a typical migration

Key Species in the Fishery 
The fish species selected in this report are pollock, 
chum salmon, small yellow croaker, hairtail, 
anchovy, Japanese sardine, chub mackerel, jack 
mackerel, filefish, Pacific saury, skipjack tuna, and 
common squid.  These are the key species in catch, 
accounting for more than 75% of the total catch since 
1980 (Table 25).  Most species have a wide range of 
distribution/migration around the Korean Peninsula.  
Unfortunately, the biology of these species has not 
been studied extensively.

Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) 
Biology 
Walleye pollock mature at age 3 when their size 
reaches about 25 to 30 cm.  They spawn in shallow 
water near the coast, and Won-San Bay in the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is as the 
largest spawning ground in the East/Japan Sea. The 
older and larger fish spawn first.  The optimum water 
temperature of spawning pollock ranges from 2° to 
5°C.  The peak spawning season varies with regions: 
November to December in southern Korean 
Peninsula waters, December near Won-San Bay, and 
January to February off the northeastern Korean 
Peninsula (Gong and Zhang, 1983).  Pollock are 
distributed along the coastal areas of the northern 
East/Japan Sea, from the southern to northern 
regions of the Korean Peninsula, Russia, and Japan.  
They reside in offshore areas, but move to the coastal 
areas for spawning.  In general, pollock tend to move 
to the upper layer in the winter and to the deep layer 
in the summer when warm water masses are strong 
in the surface layer.  Fecundity ranges from 250,000 
to 400,000 eggs (Chyung, 1974).  Pollock move 
southward from the Russian coast to the southern 
coastal areas of Korea in the spawning season.  
 
Fishery 
Korea has a long history of participation in pollock 
fisheries (Park, 1978).  Modern fishing and catch 
statistics on pollock started in the early 20th century.  
Because pollock are a cold-water species, fishing 
activities were common traditionally in northern 
Korean Peninsula waters (i.e., Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea), and this fishery was not popular 
in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula before 
the Korean War.  However, catch statistics from the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea have not 
been correctly reported since the 1940s.  In the 
northern Korean Peninsula waters, pollock catches 
were high in the middle of 1980s, with a peak around 
1.8 million t in 1983 (Kim and Kang, 1998).  They 
decreased to 400,000–500,000 t in the 1990s, and 
unofficial records have recently indicated a very low 
catch in these waters.  
 
Parts of the pollock population moved to the south 
along the coast, though the main group remained in 
northern Korean Peninsula waters.  Annual catches 
increased from the early 1970s and peaked in 1981 at 
165,000 t in the waters of the southern Korean 
Peninsula (Fig. 46).  Since then, catches have 
declined continuously.  One typical characteristic of 
the Korean pollock catch is the inclusion of 
immature juvenile pollock (called small pollock of 
ages 1 to 2 in Korean statistics).  The proportion of 
immature pollock was higher than 90% in the late 
1970s,  decreasing continuously to 40% in 1987, and 
to 18% in 1988. In 1990, it increased to 63%, but 
decreased to 12% in 1997.  For this species, there 
was no legal measure to protect juveniles, so that 
overfishing of juveniles might have influenced 
recruitment.

Climate and ocean effects 
The majority of pollock reside in northern Korean 
Peninsula waters, but no fisheries or environmental 
data are available.  The fishing areas in the 1990s 
(i.e., warm seawater and low pollock biomass) were 
restricted to coastal areas, apparently because of the 
higher SST in the south.  This contrasts with a 
broader fishing area in the late 1970s when SSTs 
were cooler.  A shift in fishing season was also 
noticed in the 2000s.  The highest catches were 
recorded in January–March during the 2000s, 
compared to November–December during the 1980s.  
There is a negative correlation between fish catch 
and seawater temperature at 50 to 100 m depth 
(Fig. 47).  A negative anomaly in SST during the 
early 1980s was coincident with a positive anomaly 
of pollock catch, while warm water masses in the 
early 1970s and 1990s resulted in low pollock 
catches.  Pollock catches are also significantly 
related to the Northeastern Pacific Pressure Index 
(Kang et al., 2000).  
 
Chum salmon (Oncorhyncus keta) 
Biology 
Five species of Pacific salmon, chum (Oncorhynchus 
keta), cherry (O. masou), pink (O. gorbuscha), silver 
(O. kisutch), and sockeye (O. nerka) are distributed 
in the Korean waters.  However, the distributions of 
pink, silver, and sockeye salmon are limited to the 
northern Korean Peninsula.  Chum salmon and 
cherry salmon are the only species released for 
salmon enhancement in Korea.  Hatcheries were 
established in 1913 on the northern Korean 
Peninsula, and intensive enhancement activities 
resumed in the mid-1980s in Korea. 
 
Adult chum salmon are distributed throughout the 
North Pacific Ocean, and return to their home stream 
when they sexually mature at age 3 or 4.  They lay eggs 
in streams (or ripened eggs are removed in the 
hatcheries), and the eggs require 100 to 120 days for 
hatching in in fresh water of around 4°C.  In the spring, 
hatched larvae with yolk become fry in hatcheries, and 
the fry enter (or are released) to the sea.  They remain in 
estuaries or coastal areas for a while, then migrate 
northward along the coast during the summer.  They 
stay in the ocean for 2 to 5 years until they return to 
their natal rivers to spawn.  The main diet of chum 
salmon caught from the Subarctic Current and Alaskan 
Gyre areas consist of zooplankton, such as copepods, 
pteropods, amphipods, euphausiids, and jellyfish 
(Nakamura et al., 2001). 
 
Fishery 
Chum salmon catches were very poor until the late 
1980s.  However, since 1990, catches from set net 
fisheries were included in these catch statistics so 
that an abrupt artificial increase in catches in 1990 
was shown (Fig. 48).  The proportion of catch by set 
net fisheries in total catch was about 70 to 80% for 
the 1990s and decreased to 50–70% in the 2000s.  
Salmon catches were seriously reduced from 553 t in 
1997 to 51 t in 2000.  Catches  increased slightly in 
2002 though they were still less than 200 t.

Climate and ocean effects 
Because of the wide distribution of salmon 
throughout its whole life span, certain environmental 
conditions at specific areas influence salmon growth, 
migration route, and return rates.  The homing 
success of chum salmon might depend on seawater 
temperature in the coastal areas because high 
temperatures have resulted in mass mortality of 
salmon fry when released.  The returning rate of 
chum salmon released from Korean hatcheries is less 
than 1% currently, which is relatively low compared 
to American and Japanese chum salmon.  There was 
a negative correlation between return rates and SST 
in the coastal areas during the release time.  The high 
temperatures in the spring of 1988–1990 and 1997–
1998 appeared to be detrimental to the survival of 
released salmon fry and, in turn, resulted in the lower 
return rates of spawners in the 1991–1994 and 2000–
2001 spawning periods, respectively (Fig. 49). 
 
Bottom-up processes and seawater temperature 
seemed to influence the growth of chum salmon 
populations in Korea.  Growth during their early life 
history in fresh water and river mouth areas was

better in the early 1990s than in the 1980s.  This 
phenomenon might be related to the increase in 
seawater temperature and zooplankton abundance 
off Korea (Fig. 50).  On the other hand, salmon 
growth in the open ocean was better in the 1980s 
than in the early 1990s.  The 1988/89 regime shift 
might have caused a change in environmental 
conditions, and ultimately, the growth of chum 
salmon in the open sea (Fig. 51).  Interestingly, 
summer growth conditions at their first year of 
ocean life in coastal areas seemed to be stable during 
the 1980s and 1990s.  In the southern Okhotsk Sea, 
there were relatively no big differences in seawater 
temperature and zooplankton biomass during the 
same time (figure not shown).

Small yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena polyactis) 
Biology 
Small yellow croakers migrate to the East China Sea 
in the winter and return to the Yellow Sea to spawn 
in the spring.  The spawning season is from April to 
June, with a peak in May in the eastern part of the 
Yellow Sea.  The species used to mature at age 5 
(NFRDI, 2005), but recently they seem to be 
maturing earlier.  The majority of fish in the fishery 
are 1- or 2-year-olds, with a mean age of 1.6 years 
(Kim et al., 1997).  
Fishery 
Small yellow croaker is an important commercial  
species off the west coast of the Korean Peninsula.  
Fishing fleets traditionally target spawning schools.  
However, recent heavy exploitation has resulted in 
limited spawning schools in the Yellow Sea.  Since 
the 1980s, the main fishing activities have moved 
from the Yellow Sea to the East China Sea.  Annual 
catches of small yellow croaker have fluctuated 
largely in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea.  
From the early 1970s to the early 1980s, the annual 
catches were about 30,000 to 50,000 t, but decreased

Catches increased in the early 1990s, and have since 
continuously decreased.  Recent catches were below 
10,000 t.  The annual catches per unit effort (CPUE) 
were higher in the 1970s, but lower after the 1980s 
(figure not shown).  
 
Climate and ocean effects 
Small yellow croaker is a demersal species in the 
Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, so that the 
survival of newly spawned eggs might be affected by 
temperature at depth.  It was found that cold and 
variable temperatures, especially seawater 
temperature at 75 m depth in the Yellow Sea, during 
the early life history of yellow croaker resulted in 
poor yields or weak year classes in the following 
years (Kim et al., 1997).  The seasonal anomaly of 
mean temperature at 75 m depth with the seasonal 
anomaly of fish catch was positive and significant, 
with a time lag of 8 to 14 months (Fig. 53).

Hairtail (Trichiurus lepturus) 
Biology 
Spawning occurs between June and October with a 
peak in August.  Hairtail are multiple spawners that 
spawn two or three times in a single season. 
Fecundity ranges from 13,000–126,000 eggs (Kim et 
al., 1998).  Hairtail are carnivorous and consume 
mainly fish, crustaceans (such as copepods, 
euphausiids and shrimps), and chaetognaths.  Their 
diet also includes small quantities of small squid.  
Hairtail have an ontogenetic progression in their 
feeding stages: an initial stage is planktivorous, in 
which they feed mainly on copepods, followed by a 
mixed feeding stage in which euphausiids, mysids, 
shrimps, chaetognaths and fish are the major food 
items.  Anchovies are major prey of large hairtail 
(Huh, 1999). 
 
Fishery 
The annual catch of hairtail was relatively large, with 
over 100,000 t, caught from the mid-1970s to the 
mid-1980s.  There was a decreasing trend beginning 
in the late 1980s that has continued to recent years 
(Fig. 54).  
 
Hairtail are distributed in the southwestern waters off 
Jeju Island from January to March.  The majority 
migrates northward along the west coast of the 
Korean Peninsula and reaches the central part of the 
Yellow Sea in July and August.  The return 
 
 
migration southward begins in September and 
reaches the wintering area off Jeju Island by 
November.  However, some groups of the stock also 
migrate northeast in March, and stay off the southern 
coast of the Korean Peninsula in May to June, and 
the southeastern waters in September.  In September, 
these groups move back to the wintering ground off 
Jeju Island (Park et al., 2002). 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
When the bottom water of western Jeju Island was 
above 14°C in the summer, the catch was large.  In 
contrast, the catch was poor when the temperature 
was below 13°C.  Therefore, the temperature of the 
bottom layer can be used as an index for forecasting 
the catch of hairtail (Kim and Rho, 1998). 
 
Anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) 
Biology 
Anchovy occur primarily in the warm water area of 
the Korea Strait and the southern area of the Yellow 
Sea during the winter, and migrate shoreward to the 
southern coast of Korea to spawn from April to 
August.  Spawning occurs at a fork length of  9 to  
12 cm during May through July, whereas adults 
above 12 cm spawn from March to September.  
Anchovy are serial spawners, and fecundity ranges 
from about 15,000 to 23,000 eggs, with specific 
batch fecundity of 438 ± 146 (Kim and Kang, 1992).

Fishery 
The fishing grounds for anchovy are in the southern 
coastal waters within 35 to 55 km off the Korean 
Peninsula.  Annual catches of anchovy increased 
from 1970 and remained around 150,000 to 200,000 t 
from 1975 to 1993 (Fig. 55).  The catch increased to 
about 240,000 t in recent years.  However, the CPUE 
was remarkably low after the peak in 1975.  The 
fishery targets juveniles with anchovy drag and set 
nets, and adults with drift gill nets.  
 
Climate and ocean effects 
Annual variation in oceanographic conditions affects 
the adult migration route and the distribution of eggs 
and larvae.  The resulting changes in distribution 
affect the locations and time of fishing.  Seasonal and 
long-term trends of the size of yolk-sac larvae (Kim, 
1992), embryonic mortality, egg production, and 
spawning stock biomass of anchovy are related to 
spring warming, summer cooling, and zooplankton 
biomass (Kim and Lo, 2001).  Seawater temperature 
data from 1983 to 1994 showed an increasing trend 
in April and a decreasing one in June (Fig. 56).  The 
trend in egg mortality, however, was opposite: daily 
mortality decreased in the spring (May) and 
increased in the summer (July) during 1983 to 1994 
(Table 26).  
 
Anchovy eggs and larvae are produced in June and 
August.  They are distributed in warm, saline water 
in June, and are carried offshore by currents in 
August.  It is likely that the distribution of anchovy 
eggs and larvae in June are significantly correlated 
with oceanic conditions in the eastern waters of 
Korea (Kim, 1992).  In summer (August), when the 
Tsushima Warm Current is strong near the coast, 
warm waters, such as warm streamers from the 
Tsushima Warm Current, intrude into the coastal 
area, and cyclonic circulations are formed.  Anchovy 
eggs and larvae are transported to the coastal area by 
these eddies.  Larval survival and growth have 
increased because of high primary production in 
these circulations (Choo and Kim, 1998).  
 
Anchovy catch is highly correlated with chlorophyll 
(Chl-a) concentrations in June and August, and with 
large zooplankton such as chaetognaths, euphausiids, 
and amphipods during autumn through spring (Kim 
and Kang, 2000; Table 27).

Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) 
Biology 
Sardines spawn off the southern waters of the Korean 
Peninsula from December through June with a peak 
spawning period in February to April. They migrate 
north in the summer to feed around 45 °N along the 
eastern coast of the Peninsula and in November, move 
south to the southern coast.  They recruit to the fishery 
at age 1 and mature at age 3.  
 
Fishery 
Japanese sardine catches show two high peaks in the 
northwestern Pacific in the 20th century:  the late 
1920s to the early 1940s and the mid-1970s to the 
early 1990s.  In Korean waters, a peak harvest of 
1,388,000 t was recorded in 1937.  Catches declined 
over a period of 25 years from the mid-1940s to the 
1960s.  Sardine catches increased rapidly from about 
 
38,000 t in 1980 to 200,000 t in 1987.  However, 
they declined again from the late 1980s.  Annual 
catches of sardines fell below 2,000 t from 2000 to 
2002 (Fig. 57). 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
The intensity of the Kuroshio Current has increased 
since 1976.  As a result the intensity and frequency 
of spring blooms has decreased in the East/Japan Sea 
and the intensity of autumn blooms has increased. 
Sardines are resident in the East/Japan Sea from June 
to November. Thus an autumn bloom is more 
advantageous to them than a spring bloom, and this 
may account for the dramatic increase in the sardine 
stock after 1976 (Zhang et al., 2000).  Sardine catch 
is positively correlated with Chl-a concentrations in 
April and negatively correlated with chaetognaths in 
April and euphausiids in June (Kim and Kang, 2000; 
Table 27).

The abundance and geographical coverage of sardine 
eggs and larvae were high in the 1980s when spawning 
biomasses were high in the mid-1980s, and vice versa 
in the late 1970s and the early 1990s.  Decadal-scale 
changes in seawater temperature at 50 m depth during 
spring indicated warm temperatures in late 1970s 
followed by cool waters during the early to mid-1980s, 
and warm again since the late 1980s.  Feeding and 
spawning areas, based on fisheries information, also 
exhibited the same pattern of extension and contraction 
as seen in ichthyoplankton surveys.  The annual 
gonado-somatic index in spawning seasons (February–
April) and the size of sardines were reduced during the 
high abundance period.  It is possible that density-
dependent processes affect the life-history parameters 
of the sardine populations in Korean waters (Kim et al., 
2006). 
 
Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) 
Biology 
Chub mackerel that migrate throughout warm water 
are widely distributed and caught in the western, 
southern, and southeastern seas around the Korean 
Peninsula, in the East China Sea, and around Japan.  
This species is distributed on the continental shelf 
from the surface to 300 m depth in the Yellow Sea 
and the East China Sea (Fig. 58).  Chub mackerel 
spawn from February to May when the water 
temperature ranges from 15° to 23°C.  They migrate 
to the wintering grounds between Jeju Island and 
Tsushima Island in the East China Sea from 
December to February.  The fecundity of chub 
mackerel ranges from 112,000 to 570,000 eggs, and 
the fork length of 50% mature females is 28.7 cm 
(Choi, 2003). 
 
The mean length of chub mackerel has tended to 
decrease since the 1970s, and the portion of small 
mackerel has increased (Fig. 59).  The fork length 
was about 32 cm in the early 1970s, but it has 
continuously decreased, and the mean fork length in 
2002 was 29.2 cm.  Some biological parameters, 
such as natural mortality, maturity length, and 
recruitment age have been estimated (Table 28). 
 
Fishery 
About 70 to 80% of the worldwide total catch of 
chub mackerel occurs in the northwestern Pacific 
Ocean by countries including Korea, Japan, and 
China (FAO, 2000).  Korean annual catches were 
below 100,000 t until the mid-1980s, and increased 
to 150,000 t in 1988 and 1989 (Fig. 60).  The annual 
catch was just 100,000 t in the early 1990s.  
However, it started to increase to over 150,000 t 
from the mid-1990s and reached its highest level of 
415,000 t in 1996.  Currently the catch is about 
170,000 t.  This species is usually caught by large 
purse seines, drift gill nets, and set nets in Korean 
waters.  About 90% of the total chub mackerel 
catches are from the large purse seine fishery, mainly 
in the East China Sea and in the western and 
southeastern seas of Korea.

Climate and ocean effects 
A significant change in recruitment was found in 
correlation with salinity (r = 0.454, P < 0.05), with 
zooplankton biomass (r = 0.692, P < 0.01), and with 
copepod biomass (r = 0.815, P < 0.01) (Choi et al., 
2000).  Also, chub mackerel catches were highly 
correlated with SST in December, Chl-a in June, and 
large zooplankton in the fall and early winter  
(Table 27).  
 
Chub mackerel share 35.7% of their habitat with 
both jack mackerel and Pacific sardine, and 28.6% 
with jack mackerel or 3.1% with Pacific sardine in 
Korean waters (Zhang and Gong, 2005).  The 1988 
climatic regime shift affected the habitat of chub 
mackerel by widening and moving it to the west of 
128°E (Fig. 61).  After 1988, the distributional 
overlap of chub mackerel and jack mackerel 
decreased.  These shifts in the habitats of jack 
mackerel and chub mackerel resulted in Japanese 
 
sardines occupying a habitat area separated from the 
shared mackerel distributions.  Replacement in 
biomass between chub mackerel and Japanese 
sardine stocks resulted from the competition of prey 
and space among major small pelagics in Korean 
waters (Zhang et al., 2000). 
 
Jack mackerel (Trachurus japonicus) 
Biology 
This species migrates to the northern East China Sea 
during January–March and to the spawning grounds 
near the western Kyushu Islands and areas between 
Jeju Island and Tsushima Island during April–May 
(Lee, 1970; Nakashima, 1982).  Jack mackerel 
spawn when water temperatures range from 16° to 
22°C.  In the East China Sea, the main distribution 
area of larvae is the Kuroshio frontal region along 
the continental margin in the winter and spring.  The 
species usually feeds on zooplankton, including 
 
 
123
larvae of anchovy and big-eye sardine (Etrumeus 
teres).  As the fish grow older, they move to deeper 
water and feed on larger prey, such as amphipods 
and mysids, but usually not copepods (Cha, 1991). 
 
There is evidence that the recruitment of jack 
mackerel is determined by the degree that eggs and 
larvae are affected by environmental factors.  These 
factors are seawater temperature, salinity, volume 
transport of the Kuroshio Current, and zooplankton 
biomass in Korean waters (Zhang and Lee, 2001).  
Significant increases in salinity in April, volume 
transport of the Kuroshio Current, and zooplankton 
biomass were observed and were significantly 
correlated with increased recruitment of jack 
mackerel in the following year (Table 29).

Fishery 
Jack mackerel (i.e., horse mackerel) are widely 
distributed and caught in the Yellow Sea, the East 
China Sea, and the southern East/Japan Sea (Kim, 
1970).  They are usually caught by large purse 
seines, bottom trawls, and drift gill nets in Korean 
waters.  About 80% of the total catches are from the 
large purse seine fishery, mostly in the East China 
Sea waters of Korea.  Annual catches reached their 
highest level of 48,000 t in 1956, and then declined 
below 10,000 t in the late 1960s.  In the early 1980s, 
the annual catch increased and has been about 
23,000 t in recent years (Fig. 62).  Over the past 70 
years, the pattern of catch has been characterized by 
a cyclic behavior with a relatively low frequency of 
30 years and a high coefficient of variation (CV) of 
0.79. 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
The volume transport of the Kuroshio increased after 
1977.  The salty Kuroshio Warm Current intensified 
the Tsushima Warm Current connected with the 
Kuroshio in the inshore waters of southern Korea.  
Warm, saline waters had a positive correlation with 
the density of jack mackerel (Cho, 1981).  Therefore, 
the increase in salinity of the East China Sea may 
have triggered the increases in the recruitment and 
biomass of jack mackerel in the early 1980s, 
resulting in increased catches. 
 
The effects of the early 1980s environmental shift 
are hypothesized to have affected the productivity of 
the jack mackerel population (Fig. 63).  As the 
volume transport of the salty Tsushima Warm 
Current increased, resulting in higher salinity in the 
East China Sea, spawning grounds for jack mackerel 
became more ideal.  Consequently, high 
concentrations of the spawning stock were observed 
in this area.  As the intensity of the Tsushima Warm 
Current increased, the variation of zooplankton 
biomass in the East China Sea waters of Korea was 
expected to correspond to the variation of 
stratification of ocean structure.  Since the 
thermocline in the East China Sea is formed at 30 to 
50 m depth, and the water is relatively shallow (75 to 
150 m; NFRDI, 2005) where photosynthesis can be 
active in all seasons, the increase in zooplankton 
biomass may not have been directly related to the 
primary production in the early 1980s in the East 
China Sea waters of Korea.  The increase of 
recruitment and biomass in the plankton-feeding jack 
mackerel stock after the early 1980s can be attributed 
124 
to the aggregation of the spawning stock and the 
increase of prey in the East China Sea (Zhang and 
Lee, 2001). 
 
Jack mackerel share 63.4% of their habitat with chub 
mackerel in Korean waters (Zhang and Lee, 2001).  
Jack mackerel share 36.6% of their habitat with both 
chub mackerel and Japanese sardine, and further, 
were not found to co-exist with Japanese sardine 
exclusively during the period from 1980 to 1998 
(Fig. 61).  The 1988 climatic regime shift affected 
the habitat of jack mackerel by shifting it southward 
to 27°N.  After 1988, the distributional overlap of 
jack mackerel and chub mackerel decreased.  These 
shifts in the habitats of jack mackerel and chub 
mackerel resulted in Pacific sardine occupying a 
habitat area separated from the shared mackerel 
distributions (Zhang et al., 2004).

Filefish (Thamnaconus modestus) 
Biology 
Filefish are a subtropical species that spend the 
winters in the East China Sea.  They begin to migrate 
within the warm current in April, moving to the 
East/Japan Sea and the Yellow Sea.  The northward 
migration to the East/Japan Sea along the Korean 
coastline begins in May, and some schools reach the 
northern Korean Peninsula coastal areas where they 
spend the summer.  Eggs and larvae are advected by 
currents so that their distributions extend to the 
northern part of the East/Japan Sea.  Another group 
that migrates to the Yellow Sea occupies the entire 
Yellow Sea in June, migrating southward beginning in 
October.  Filefish are distributed from 5 to 200 m 
depth at seawater temperatures of 10° to 28°C.  
Spawning is from April to June.  The total length at 
50% maturity is 21 cm, and fecundity ranges from 
210,000 to 1,460,000 eggs.  The longevity of filefish 
is estimated to be 8 years, which corresponds to a total 
length of about 30 cm. 
Fishery 
Annual catches of filefish in Korean waters increased 
from 80,000 t in 1975, to about 230,000 t in 1979, 
and then declined slightly.  After the mid-1980s 
catches increased sharply and peaked at 330,000 t in 
1986.  Catches fluctuated from the late 1980s to 
1990, and dropped to 70,000 t in 1991, where they 
have remained at a very low level (Fig. 64). 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
Filefish productivity increased after 1976 when the 
warm currents became stronger (Fig. 65).  There 
were some indications of climate regime shifts 
occurring in 1976 and around 1987 to 1989 in 
Korean waters.  The indicators of these shifts were 
the patterns of seawater temperature, precipitation, 
volume transport of the Kuroshio, and mixed layer 
depth.  Seawater temperature in the East/Japan Sea 
increased significantly in 1976 and 1987.  In 
addition, precipitation and mixed layer depth in the 
East/Japan Sea, and the volume transport of the 
Kuroshio increased in 1976 and 1977.  The increased 
volume transport of the Kuroshio in the East China 
Sea resulted in a strong influx of the Tsushima Warm 
Current into the Korea Strait and the East/Japan Sea.

Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) 
Biology 
The distribution of Pacific saury is determined by 
seawater temperature and salinity.  They are not 
distributed in the western East China Sea and Yellow 
Sea, where salinity is low, but mainly reside in the 
East/Japan Sea and around Hokkaido.  The migration 
area of Pacific saury has been limited to within the 
Tsushima Warm Current system.  The stock that 
spends the winter near western Kyushu (January–
March) moves to Ulleung Island in April to June.  
The southward migration of Pacific saury begins in 
September and reaches Tsushima Island in 
November to December. 
 
Pacific saury are distributed from the surface to 30 m 
depth at seawater temperatures of 7° to 24°C.  They 
spawn twice a year, in the spring and in autumn.  The 
fork lengths at 50% maturity of the spawning groups 
in the spring and autumn are 22 and 30 cm, 
respectively, and the spawning periods are April to 
July and October to November, respectively.  
Fecundity ranges from 20,000 to 85,000 eggs.  The 
longevity of Pacific saury is estimated to be 3 years, 
which corresponds to a length of about 35 cm. 
Fishery 
Pacific saury are caught mainly by stick-held dip 
nets and drift gill nets in Korean waters.  Annual 
catches have fluctuated during the last four decades.  
The annual average catch was 25,000 t in the 1960s 
and early 1970s, but it started to decline sharply 
 
from 1976, dropping to about 2,000 t in 1984.  
Catches reached a minimum level of 500 t in 1992.  
They increased after the mid-1990s, and have 
fluctuated between 5,000 and 20,000 t in recent years 
(Fig. 66). 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
The increased volume transport of the Kuroshio in 
the East China Sea resulted in a strong influx of the 
Tsushima Warm Current into the Korea Strait and 
the East/Japan Sea that followed along into the North 
Pacific Current during the climate-driven regime 
shift in the mid-1970s and 1980s.  Heavy rain, higher 
sea surface temperatures, unusual northward shifting 
of the polar front, and increased thickness of the 
warm water layer in the north resulted in a northward 
shifting of the overwintering ground of Pacific saury 
and an earlier-than-normal migration of the species 
to the spawning and feeding areas south and north of 
the polar front in the spring (Fig. 67). 
 
The area of a stable thermocline in the coastal zone 
was reduced because of unusual westward and 
northward shifting of the polar front, which resulted 
in the reduction of primary production.  The critical 
depth barely exceeded the deeper-than-normal mixed 
layer depth in the winter and early spring in the 
spawning and feeding grounds of Pacific saury 
during the early phase of the regime shift (1975–
1977).  Therefore, the delayed onset of the spring 
bloom of plankton (prey) and the earlier-than-normal 
arrival of spawning groups of Pacific saury resulted 
in the mismatch of prey and predator (larvae and

adult) in the spawning and feeding grounds.  The 
dramatic decrease in the ratio of the large size group 
of Pacific saury and abrupt drop of catches and 
abundance may have been caused by heavy fishing 
under the destructive recruitment failure and mass 
mortality of Pacific saury in the mid-1970s (Zhang 
and Gong, 2005). 
 
Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) 
Biology 
Skipjack tuna is an epipelagic fish, occurring in 
waters ranging from 15° to 30°C.  In the western 
Pacific, they have been captured as far north as 44°N 
off Japan, and as far south as 37°S off Australia 
(Forsbergh, 1980).  However, in the eastern Pacific, 
they have been fished along the west coast of the 
Americas from 34°N off southern California to 27°S 
off northern Chile (Williams, 1970).  This is due to 
the westward transport of warm surface waters and 
their poleward displacement along the western coast.  
 
In warm equatorial water, skipjack tuna spawn year 
round.  Sexual maturity may occur in fish as small as 
40 cm in length (Matsumoto et al., 1984). However, 
most fish appear to mature at larger sizes.  Larger 
females produce significantly more eggs than smaller 
females, with the average adult producing 80,000 to 
2 million eggs per year.  Skipjack tuna feed primarily 
upon fishes, crustaceans, and mollusks.  Cannibalism 
is common within this species as well.  Their diet 
 
129
appears to be very broad and suggests an opportunistic 
method of feeding. Schools of skipjack are commonly 
found near convergences and upwellings.  
 
Fishery 
Skipjack tuna catches have been increasing at a rapid 
and fairly constant rate since the early 1970s.  In the 
1970s, the development of bait boat fisheries in 
Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands and the 
expansion of the Japanese distant-water, bait boat 
fishery led to the first large increases.  In the 1980s, 
the development of large-scale purse seining in the 
Western Pacific Ocean (WPO) and the subsequent 
influx of vessels from several distant-water fishing 
nations resulted in further increases.  In the 1990s, 
the policy of many canneries was not to buy tuna 
caught in association with dolphins, which has 
resulted in the relocation of many purse seiners to the 
WPO.  This policy brought about further increases in 
the skipjack tuna catch in the WPO.  
 
Korean fleets started to operate in the central WPO 
(WCPO) in the 1980 to 1981 season when large-scale 
purse seining developed in this area.  Along with the 
increase in the number of fishing vessels, the fishing 
grounds expanded, and the catch increased.  Since the 
catch first recorded over 100,000 t in 1990, it has 
increased to 174,000 t in 2002. 
  
Climate and ocean effects 
More than five major countries are catching skipjack 
tuna living in warmer waters other than in the 
WCPO.  Korea is one of the major countries 
operating in these waters, along with Papua New 
Guinea, Japan, U.S., and Taiwan.  The Korean catch
was 153,328 t out of 823,849 t in total for the WCPO 
in 2003.  Even though the Korean catch was not the 
main component of the total WCPO, (about 18% of 
total catch) the Korean data reflect a tendency 
similar to that of the whole WCPO data (R = 
0.901**) (Fig. 68). 
 
Korean fishing grounds have changed in time and 
space. As reported by Lehodey et al. (1997), 
computed longitudinal gravity centres of CPUE (G) 
from Korean fishery data were shifted toward the 
east during El Niño years (1986/87, 1991/92, 
1997/98) (Fig. 69).  The location of G and catch 
were compared with some environmental factors, 
such as the SOI, SST in NIÑO3.4, and SST in the 
main fishing ground (140°–170°E) to find some 
relationship between them.  G shows a high 
correlation with ENSO factors:  SOI (R = – 0.652*) 
and SST in NIÑO3.4 (R = 0.498*), and catch is 
significantly correlated with SST in the main fishing 
ground (R = 0.314*) (Table 30).  Cross-correlation 
analysis with a time lag indicates that the evolution 
of the SOI and SST in NIÑO3.4 preceded the CPUE 
gravity center by four months (R = – 0.73**) and 
three months (R = 0.643**), respectively (table not 
shown). 
 
There was no seasonality in the biological 
characteristics (length and GSI) of skipjack tuna.  
However, ENSO significantly affected skipjack 
length and maturation, though SST at 140–170°E 
(i.e., distribution area of skipjack tuna) did not have 
influence.  SOI and SST in NIÑO3.4 may have 
previously affected the fish length by 6 to 7 months 
ahead of time.  Maturation was affected by 
environmental components about a year ahead.

Common squid (Todarodes pacificus) 
Biology 
The life span of common squid is assumed to be 1 
year (Nakamura and Sakurai, 1993), and their 
spawning season is spread throughout the year.  As 
suggested for common squid in Japanese waters 
(Okutani, 1983; Yamada et al., 1986), three 
spawning groups of common squid have been 
identified in Korean waters:  summer (June–August), 
autumn (September–November) and winter 
(January–March) (Kim et al., 1997).  Male common 
squid mature about 2 months earlier than females.  
Females mature 2 or 3 weeks after mating.  Once

mature females spawn, they die (Yamada et al., 
1986; Ikeda et al., 1993).  Individuals are 
differentiated by mantle length, and the mantle sizes 
for winter, summer, and autumn spawning 
subpopulations have been measured at 24, 23 and 27 
cm, respectively (Yamada et al., 1986).  
 
Stomach contents of the common squid consist of fish, 
cephalopods, crustaceans, algae, and unidentified 
matter.  Fish are generally the most preferred prey.  
Although the major food items of summer and autumn 
populations are fish, those of the winter population are 
cephalopods.  Algae and crustaceans are minor food 
sources.  The three spawning groups seem to mix 
genetically, and contain the same stomach contents 
(Kim and Kang, 1998). 
 
Fishery 
In the East/Japan Sea, squid catches were at low 
levels (around 50,000 t) until the late 1980s, but 
increased rapidly after the early 1990s.  Annual 
catches of squid ranged from 100,000 to 250,000 t 
during the 1990–2002 period (Fig. 70).  The main 
fishing grounds of the squid angling fishery start to 
move to the north in the East/Japan Sea in April and 
to the south in September.  The condition of common 
squid fishing largely depends on the fluctuation of 
water temperature in the southeastern coastal area.  It 
is concluded that the high stability of water 
temperatures and the weak strength of cold water are 
the reasons for the good fishing conditions of 
common squid (Park et al., 1998). 
 
When catches were low in 1980s, the proportion of 
autumn spawners (i.e., September and October) was 
 
the highest among spawning populations.  However, 
as catches increased in the 1990s, the highest 
proportion of spawners shifted to November and 
December (Fig. 71). The increased catch from late 
autumn and early winter caused difficulties in 
distinguishing autumn and winter spawners.  The 
amount of autumn catch was about double that of the 
winter catch during the 1980s, but catch levels were 
almost same in both populations during the 1990s.  
During the early 1990s, there was a rapid increase in 
winter catch while the autumn catch steadily 
increased (T. Sakurai, pers. comm.). 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
In the East/Japan Sea, squid catches increased 
continuously after the early 1990s.  A correlation 
analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship 
between squid catch and zooplankton biomass  
(Table 31).  In the northern and southern regions, the 
sum of squid catches from September to December is 
significantly correlated with zooplankton biomass 
except in two cases in the northern region: the sum 
of December (n – 1 year) and February, and 
February and April.  The sum of zooplankton 
biomass in October and December in the n – 1 year 
showed the highest significant correlation with squid 
catches (r = 0.864 in the northern region and r = 
0.818 in the southern region, P < 0.001).  The squid 
catch is significantly associated with the abundance 
of euphausiids (r = 0.578 in the northern region and 
r = 0.840 in the southern region, P < 0.05) and 
amphipods (r = 0.695 in the northern region and r = 
0.648 in the southern region, P < 0.01).

Zooplankton biomass in October and December in 
the previous year showed a higher significant 
correlation with squid catches in September to 
December. Catch in October and December 
produced squid less than 10 cm in mantle size than in 
the previous year.  Thus, zooplankton are more 
important for squid at the juvenile stage than for the 
adults, and it contributed to increased squid stocks 
after 1990.  Of the four major zooplankton taxa, 
euphausiids and amphipods were significantly 
related with the squid catch.  This shows that 
zooplankton, in particular euphausiids and 
amphipods, are very important for young squid in the 
East/Japan Sea.  It is concluded that the most 
important factor for increased squid catches is 
increased zooplankton biomass, especially 
euphausiids and amphipods (Kang et al., 2002). 
 
Seawater temperature might be the most important 
parameter controlling stock abundance.  When squid 
 
133
catches increased in the early 1990s, the SST in 
Korean waters increased at the same time.  In 
particular, seawater temperature during winter 
seemed to be more important than during other 
seasons.  When the winter temperature rose in 1990s, 
the winter population of common squid also showed 
a rapid increase compared to the autumn population. 
 
Speculations on the Impact of Greenhouse 
Gas-induced Climate Change 
This chapter speculates on the relationship between 
environmental changes and fish species in Korean 
waters.  Environments are variable over time, and 
fish have a relatively routine life history.  Fish 
spawning is influenced by some abiotic 
environmental factors, such as temperature, and their 
growth and survival are controlled by the abundance 
of prey and predators surrounding them.  In order to 
figure out the ecological mechanisms, however, it 
requires extensive survey efforts, and a multi-
disciplinary approach is essential to explain the 
relationship.  In general, the marine ecosystems in 
Korean waters are varied and complex because large-
scale climate events, such as ENSO, monsoons and 
the PDO, have an impact on water properties 
indirectly or directly.  The fish species also exhibit 
numerous patterns of behavior.  Oceanography and 
the biology of fish have not been extensively studied.  
Therefore, due to limited scientific knowledge, we 
are limited in explaining the relationship between 
climate change and marine ecosystems, including 
fish populations in Korean waters.  Below is a brief 
speculation of the environmental impacts on major 
fish species around the Korean Peninsula. 
 
Walleye pollock 
Walleye pollock are a cold-water, demersal species 
and their spawning grounds in Korea are located at 
the southern limit of their distribution.  They spawn 
in shallow bays off Korean Peninsula (Won-San Bay 
in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea), and 
juveniles might stay in the upper layer near the 
coastal areas.  Although adults show demersal 
behavior, a future warming trend of SST might force 
fish distribution from south to north.  The catch is 
traditionally made up of juveniles who would have to 
migrate into the fishing areas from the north.  
Furthermore, warming of the spawning grounds 
could be detrimental to the spawning adults, as well 
as to their early life stages.  A general warming trend 
in the future, therefore, would probably result in low 
pollock abundance, although the impact of regimes 
would result in periods of cooler SST when pollock 
might return. 
 
Chum salmon 
Chum salmon are a cold-water species that stay in 
the surface layers of the ocean through most of their 
life cycle.  Salmon hatcheries in Korea are at the 
southern range of their distribution and would be 
expected to be negatively affected by a warming of 
the ocean surface.  Hatcheries could maintain a 
production of salmon fry, but ocean survival would 
be reduced,  especially if there is higher seawater 
temperature at the timing of fry release. Production is 
affected by regimes which would suggest that there 
will be periods in the future when the marine 
survival of chum salmon would improve.  However, 
a general warming trend in Korean waters would 
probably result in low chum salmon abundance and a 
low returning rate, even though climate/ 
environmental changes in the open ocean could also 
have a strong impact on the growth of chum salmon 
populations. 
 
Small yellow croaker, hairtail, filefish 
In the Yellow Sea, environmental conditions are 
influenced by many factors, such as the Kuroshio, 
seasonal monsoons and winds, and river runoff.  
Because of its shallow bathymetry, the Yellow Sea 
does not have truly demersal fish populations. 
However, in contrast to pelagic fish species, such as 
anchovy, some species (e.g., small yellow croaker, 
hairtail, and filefish) locate in the relatively deep 
waters in the center of the southern Yellow Sea and 
the East China Sea.  
 
The recruitment success of small yellow croaker is 
dependent upon seawater temperature, and 
consequently, catches would be improved 8 to 10 
months later if warm and stable conditions formed at 
75 m depth during the early life stages.  However, 
the relationship between surface and bottom layers, 
and the cause–effect mechanism between 
environment and organisms have not been identified.  
There are too many unknown factors in the Yellow 
Sea ecosystem to determine the impact of warming 
on demersal fish species. 
 
As we showed for small yellow croaker, it is not 
possible to speculate on the impact of global 
134 
warming on demersal species, such as hairtail and 
filefish because the biology and ecology of these 
species is mostly unknown.  One study on filefish 
indicated that catches were high in the 1980s and low 
in the 1990s.  If the Aleutian Low intensifies under a 
global warming scenario, the volume transport of the 
Kuroshio would also increase which should favor 
improved filefish productivity.  However, different 
fish species have different life cycles and habitat 
areas, and large-scale climate change might not show 
the same common effects for all fish species. 
 
Anchovy, Japanese sardine, mackerels and 
common squid 
In Korean waters, the portion of small pelagic fish 
species (anchovy, Japanese sardine, mackerels and 
common squid) has been increasing.  In recent years, 
ten major small pelagic species have occupied 60 to 
70% of the total catch, and common squid alone 
accounted for 20 to 25%.  In many ecosystems 
around the world, abundance of anchovy follows 
trends that are opposite to those of the sardine.  In 
Korean waters, however, an alternation between 
anchovy and sardine was not evident.  There is 
improved larval survival and growth when the 
Tsushima Warm Current is strong near the coast of 
Korea, but it is not yet known what the relationship 
is between warming and Kuroshio strength. 
 
There was a dramatic increase in sardine abundance 
after 1976, indicating that there are trends in 
abundance.  The increase in abundance was related 
to an increase in the intensity of the Kuroshio and the 
increase in the plankton bloom in the autumn.  One 
scenario for global warming forecasts is that there 
will be more frequent, intense Aleutian Lows which 
suggests that there will be more frequent periods 
typical of ocean conditions observed in the 1980s.  If 
this is correct, periods of sardine abundance may be 
more frequent.  
 
Chub mackerel and anchovy abundances increased in 
the mid-1990s, a period of high SST in December.  
ENSO might have an influence on seawater 
temperature in December. An elevated seawater 
temperature due to ENSO seemed to cause a high 
rate of growth and a good year class of those 
populations in Korean waters (Kim and Kang, 2000).  
In addition, there is clear evidence that climate, and 
climate shifts, affect the production of chub 
mackerel.  More intense Aleutian Lows and a 
positive PDO may have a negative impact.  Jack 
mackerel production follows a cyclic pattern of about 
30 years. 
 
There were large increases in the abundance of 
common squid in the 1990s when SST increased.  If 
there are more frequent periods of intense Aleutian 
Lows, then abundance would decrease.  However, if 
wind intensity is reduced and SST increased, then 
common squid will become more abundant. 
 
Pacific saury 
The abundance of Pacific saury is related more to the 
ENSO than to the PDO.  The period of more frequent 
and intense El Niños in the mid-1990s appeared to be 
favorable for Pacific saury production.  If wind 
intensity is reduced as a result of global warming, 
and El Niños become more frequent, Pacific saury 
production may increase. However, an intensification 
of the Aleutian Low may reduce abundance. 
 
Skipjack tuna 
ENSO evidently has an effect on skipjack tuna 
biology as well as its fishery.  However, the 
relationship between ENSO and the global warming 
trend (i.e., increase in greenhouse gas) is not clearly 
understood in tropical waters.

The Fishery  
Total catch of marine commercial resources in the 
Russian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) increased 
from 1980 until 1986, and then declined (Table 32).  
In 1988, there were large landings of two highly 
abundant species: walleye pollock and Pacific 
sardine.  These two species made up about 80% of 
the Russian total catch in the 1980s.  In general, the 
late 1980s and early 1990s were years of high 
abundance of walleye pollock and sardine stocks.  In 
the 1990s walleye pollock stocks declined, resulting 
in a general decline in catches.  In 1992, no Pacific 
sardines were harvested commercially in the Russian 
EEZ as a result of a natural decline that was related 
to changes in the climate and ocean.  Pacific herring 
catches grew from 2.5 to 25% from 1985 to 2000 as 
a result of an increase in herring stock abundance in 
1990.  In the late 1990s, the share of pink salmon 
catch increased 2 to 3 times compared to 1980s, and 
constituted 9% of the total catch.  Variability in catch 
data for other fishes was also observed, e.g., during 
1985–2000, the share of flatfishes and cod increased 
in the total catch. 
  
In this report we consider how climate and ocean 
conditions have affected the abundance and catch of 
key species in the fishery since 1980 (Table 33).  
From 1980 until about the mid-1990s, the species 
examined here represented over 80% of the catch.  In 
the early 1990s, they represented larger percentages 
of the catch, exceeding 90% of the total catch  
(Table 33). 
 
Climate and Ocean Influences 
Inter-annual, decadal, and long-term variability in 
the climate and ocean cause considerable 
rearrangements in marine communities.  Historically, 
there were warm and cold periods.  Assuming long-
term variability with natural cycles lasting hundreds 
of years, the last large cold period was 13 to 18 
centuries ago (a small “ice age”).  The average 
global temperature has risen gradually since the mid- 
19th century (Fig. 72).  In this case, the 20th century 
belongs to the recent warm epoch.  Shorter

cycles of 2 years to decadal periods can be 
distinguished within these longer cycles.  It is very 
important to take into account natural cycles of both 
short-term and longer duration to properly forecast 
future changes (Shuntov, 2001).  Some data show 
that 40- to 60-year-long cycles can be of primary 
importance (Klyashtorin and Sidorenkov, 1996; 
Shuntov еt al., 1997).  These cycles significantly 
influence the environment, providing inter-decadal 
faunal changes and long-term fluctuations in various 
species.  Shorter cycles may also have an impact on 
marine communities and species dynamics, but their 
effect is much smaller. 
 
In the last century, the first period of warming lasted 
30 years, from 1920 to 1940.  At that time, summer 
seasons could be described as the first “sardine 
epoch” of the 20th century.  Large-scale migrations 
of subtropical, and even tropical, fishes and other 
southern species occurred into the Far Eastern 
temperate waters. 
 
The second period of warming lasted from 1970 to the 
1980s.  These years were characterized by the second 
rise in Pacific sardine abundance, and by warm-water 
species migrations to the Far Eastern region.  During 
that period, the temperature was generally higher than 
in the 1920s and 1930s (Fig. 72).

The last warm period was longer, with a gradual rise 
in temperature (Fig. 72).  Recently, marine 
communities have become influenced by a 
temperature decline that started in the mid-1990s.  At 
the same time, the average global temperature 
remains high.  Pacific sardine abundance decreased 
in the early 1990s.  Considerable rearrangements in 
nekton and plankton communities of the Far Eastern 
seas were noticed at that time (Shuntov, 1986; 
Klyashtorin and Sidorenkov, 1996; Shuntov et al., 
1997). 
 
There are a lot of arguments in favour of both global 
warming and cooling.  A compromise might be to 
describe it as, “cooling on the background of global 
warming” (Anonymous, 1993), which does not either 
support or refute the concept of greenhouse gas-
induced climate change. This compromise in 
wording suggests that there can be an interaction 
between climate cycles of different duration and 
character. 
 
In the 20th century, the human impact on nature 
started to have a negative on the environment.  As a 
result, numerous investigations of the anthropogenic 
influence on climate took place.  In these studies, the 
greenhouse effect that resulted from carbon dioxide 
increase in the atmosphere, as well as other sources 
of air pollution, was considered.  The effect of these 
factors on temperature can be mutually exclusive.  
Speaking of the human impact on climate change, we 
should also keep in mind that there were warm 
periods even greater than the recent one in the 
history of the Earth.  Climate changes that 
historically appeared as alterations of warm and cold 
periods are proceeding as natural cycles with 
regional features (Shuntov, 2001).  This was 
observed in the Far Eastern seas at the brink of the 
20th and 21st centuries.  Cyclic changes in 
atmospheric processes over, and ice conditions in, 
the Far Eastern seas have shown that after the very 
hot year of 1997, ocean temperature cooled in the 
Far Eastern seas (Glebova, 2002).  Most data sets 
were obtained during TINRO-Centre research cruises 
in the Okhotsk Sea, the main area for Russian 
 
commercial fishery operations (Shuntov et al., 2002).  
After 1997, considerable cooling was observed 
judging from average water temperature (Table 34), 
ice conditions (Fig. 73), and the extent of cold areas 
(Figs. 74 and 75).  Similar trends were observed in 
the western Bering Sea where the late 1990s, as well 
as 2001 and 2002, were relatively cold (Radchenko, 
2001; G.V. Hen and others, pers. comm.).  
Environmental processes were not always 
synchronous in the northwestern and southwestern 
parts of the sea, which also showed considerable 
annual variability.  Around the Kuril Islands  
(Fig. 76), variability patterns, including circulation 
and temperature, were different from the adjacent 
Okhotsk Sea area.  In some years that were cold in 
the northern Okhotsk Sea, there were positive 
temperature anomalies along the Kuril Islands 
(Samko and Novikov, 2002).  
 
Key Species in the Fishery 
Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) 
Biology 
Pink salmon are the most numerous among the 
Pacific salmon species, constituting about 40% of the 
biomass and 60% of the number of total salmon 
landings in the North Pacific Ocean.  Pink salmon 
have the shortest and simplest life cycle.  As soon as 
the fry leave their spawning sites, they migrate 
downstream into the sea where they grow first in the 
coastal areas and then in the central North Pacific 
Ocean.  After 12 to 14 months, maturing individuals 
come back to their native rivers to spawn and die. 
 
The freshwater natural habitat of pink salmon 
includes Asian and North American rivers north of 
approximately 40°N.  Pink salmon are distributed 
north of 40°N in the sea, and dwell in southern areas 
in winter.  In spring, as soon as the water warms, 
they move northward to their spawning streams.  The 
spawning period lasts from June to November, 
depending on the region.

Pink salmon differ from other Pacific salmon species 
because (1) they have a 2-year life cycle; (2) mature 
individuals are the smallest of all the species, (1.0 to 
2.5 kg, on the average); (3) young fish leave the 
spawning sites and migrate downstream immediately 
after hatching (chum salmon also behave this way), 
and (4) mature males possess a distinctive hump.  The 
2-year cycle results in reproductively isolated 
generations of odd and even years that may differ in 
abundance.  Today, in eastern Kamchatka, odd-year 
generations of pink salmon are more numerous, while 
in western Kamchatka even-year broods are more 
abundant.  However, this odd- and even-year 
behaviour can change and deviations from the 2-year 
life cycle may occur.  Unlike other Pacific salmon 
species, pink salmon do not conduct long-distance 
spawning migrations up rivers.  Most reproduce close 
to the river mouth, usually within 10 km of the ocean.  
The homing instinct is rather weakly developed in this 
species, and some individuals can stray for several 
hundreds, and even thousands, of kilometres away 
from their native places.  Pink salmon individual 
fecundity varies from 900 to 2,700 eggs, with an 
average range of 1,300 to 1,600 eggs. 
Fishery 
Pink salmon are fished only in the coastal areas of 
Russia.  Most of the fish are harvested as they 
migrate along the shoreline and approach their natal 
rivers.  Large stationary traps are usually placed 
along the coast near the spawning river mouths, with 
a lead stretching from the shore area to the trap.  Pink 
salmon catches increased in the 1980s and 1990s for 
both even- and odd-year runs (Table 35).  Even-year 
catches were largest in 1998 as were odd-year 
catches in 1991; however, catches have remained 
high relative to the early 1980s.  Landings of pink 
salmon in the Russian EEZ (Fig. 77) from 1971 to 
2002 show that during the last 5 odd years, reserves 
have remained at a high level.  The average annual 
catch for odd years is about 128,000 t.  The biggest 
catches of pink salmon for odd years take place in 
three areas: eastern Kamchatka, and the eastern 
Sakhalin and southern Kuril islands.  The rivers on 
the west coast of the Okhotsk Sea provide a 
considerable contribution to the total catches.  
During the last 2 odd years in particular, catches of 
pink salmon have increased on the eastern coast of 
Sakhalin Island.

Climate and ocean effects 
In the 1990s, the dynamics of climatic processes over 
the North Pacific appear to have become unfavourable 
for salmon production (Beamish and Bouillon, 1993; 
Chigirinsky, 1993).  However, pink salmon are the 
most difficult of  all the salmon species to forecast 
future runs.  Currently, the even-year stocks are very 
productive in western Kamchatka and in the southern 
Kuril Islands; if this situation continues, a return 
comparable to the high harvest levels of 1920–1930 
could occur (Radchenko, 1998).  
 
Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) 
Biology 
Asian chum salmon consist of numerous 
reproductively isolated local populations that differ 
in some biological traits.  The population structure is 
complicated by geographical differences and 
seasonal races.  Young chum salmon migrate early 
from the spawning grounds, mostly as fry, though 
some migrate later.  In Kamchatka, the fry migrate 
from early April to July, with a peak in mid-May to 
early June.  In the Anadyr River, fry begin 
downstream migrations in late May to early June.  In 
the northern Okhotsk Sea, fry migrate from May 
until June, with a maximum run in early June. 
 
In summer, in the coastal areas of the Russian Far 
Eastern seas, juveniles are present from late July 
until early August.  Yearlings migrate to the 
southeastern Bering Sea by late November.  While in 
the southern Okhotsk Sea, they may feed until early 
winter because of favourable hydrologic conditions.  
In the Okhotsk Sea, the yearlings feed primarily on 
amphipods (Themisto japonica and Primno abissalis) 
and euphausiids (Thysanoessa longipes and 
Euphausia pacifica).  Pteropods, copepods, and 
tunicates are of less importance in their diet. 
 
During the winter–spring feeding period in the open 
ocean, chum salmon live primarily within the area of 
subarctic and subtropical water masses, where the 
temperature ranges from 3° to 11°C.  By late May, 
age 2+ chum salmon migrate back to the Kuril, 
Aleutian and Komandor islands and enter the 
Okhotsk and Bering seas.  The Bering Sea serves as 
the main feeding area for immature fish during the 
summer, while the Okhotsk Sea is less important.  In 
general, the distribution of older chum salmon in the 
Far Eastern seas during summer–autumn is as 
follows: large immature fish stay in the coastal 
regions; age 2+ and older immature fish are located 
over the slope and outer-shelf areas, while 2-year-old 
fish are offshore over deep-water basins. 
 
Chum salmon range in age from 2 to 6 years old.  
There are mostly 3+ (sometimes 4+) fish among those 
returning to spawn.  Spawning fish of ages 1+, 2+ and 
5+ are rare in Asian rivers.  The average weight of age 
3+ and 4+ chum salmon from the summer spawning 
run range from 2.90 to 3.75 kg, and from the autumn 
spawning run, from 3.6 to 5.4 kg. 
 
A survey conducted in chum feeding regions has 
shown that the temperature range for this species is 
much wider than was considered previously, ranging 
from 1.5° to 20°C.  In the first year of marine life, 
Landings (t) 
Year 
144 
chum salmon prefer water colder than 10.8°C.  Older 
fish have been observed in warmer waters.  Mature 
fish can be found beyond these limits, and can dwell 
not only in the surface layer but can also migrate 
within a wide depth range.  The number of immature 
fish feeding in the Okhotsk and Bering seas depends 
on the extent of Pacific water advection.  When the 
inflow of the Pacific waters into the seas is weak, the 
immature chum migrations are also small, and vice 
versa. 
 
Chum salmon are not necessarily a typical 
planktivorous species in the Far Eastern seas.  In 
summer they often feed on nekton, including mostly 
young pelagic, and occasionally, mesopelagic fishes.  
In the Bering Sea, they feed mainly upon pteropods.  
In the Okhotsk Sea, they prefer pteropods in 
reproductive areas and in areas with dense 
aggregations of these molluscs.  For zooplankton 
diet, chum salmon prefer euphausiids.  Gelatinous 
plankton dominates in mature chum salmon stomach 
contents in the Okhotsk Sea, which could be related 
to their physiology. 
 
Fishery 
From the early 1950s to the mid-1970s, the Russian 
harvest of chum salmon decreased.  This decrease 
was gradual but rather significant and was 
undoubtedly connected to the depleted condition of 
the Russian chum salmon stocks.  A slow recovery 
of chum salmon stocks occurred in the 1980s, but 
during the 1990s these stocks began to decrease 
again (Table 36).  It is believed that competition with 
the chum salmon juveniles of Japanese hatchery 
origin during the marine rearing phase has prevented 
recovery of the wild Russian chum salmon stocks to 
some degree. 
 
Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) 
Biology 
Sockeye (also known as red) salmon reproduce in the 
rivers flowing into the Pacific Ocean and its northern 
seas from northern Hokkaido to the northern Bering 
Sea along the Asian coast (Bugaev, 1995).  They 
enter spawning rivers from mid-May until 
September, depending on the region.  Upon entering 
a river, pre-spawning fish may stay there as long as 
1 month, and up to 1–2 or 3–4 months in lakes 
before spawning.  There are well-defined seasonal 
stocks of sockeye salmon that have different 
spawning times.  The differences may be as much as 
15 to 20 days.  In the Asian sockeye populations 
early (spring) and late (summer) runs occur.  
Spawning grounds are confined to rivers, and lakes 
with groundwater springs.  Spawning time depends 
on the average temperature for the incubation of 
eggs:  the higher the temperature, the later the 
spawning time (Brannon, 1987; Burgner, 1991).  
Embryonic and larval development takes from 5 to 8 
months.  The hatching period can be extended, 
depending on spawning time and temperature in the 
spawning grounds.  Most sockeye salmon rear in 
fresh water for at least 1 year.  Beginning from the 
larval stage, the species exhibit shoaling behaviour.  
The freshwater period of young sockeye from 
different stocks lasts from 1 to 4 years.  Fry with a 
yolk sack start feeding mainly upon benthic

In most cases, sockeye salmon migrate to the sea at 
age 2, and rarely at age 3.  Smolts stay in coastal 
waters before migrating offshore in fall.  Sockeye 
salmon feed mainly on plentiful crustaceans, 
pteropods, and small pelagic fish.  Survival, growth, 
and migration patterns of the fish during during their 
marine period largely depend on conditions within 
feeding areas and stock abundance.  
 
Fishery 
Stocks of Pacific salmon species along the Asian 
coast are harvested by driftnet, set in coastal areas 
and rivers.  Catch statistics for the Russian and Asian 
fisheries are usually combined into a total for all 
“Asian” catches (Table 37).  However, driftnet data 
are considered separately in Table 37 because it is 
difficult to estimate the origin of fish in high-seas 
catches.  Asian sockeye salmon catches were low in 
the late 1940s through to the mid-1950s.  From the 
mid-1950s to the mid-1980s catches were 1,150 to 
 
5,590 t.  In 2002, total sockeye salmon landings were 
22,800 t, close to maximum catches taken in the 
1920s and 1930s when 14,570 to 39,750 t of sockeye 
salmon were annually harvested. 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
Catch statistics for sockeye salmon generally follow 
the trend for combined Pacific salmon landings in 
Asia and North America (Klyashtorin, 1998; 
Klyashtorin and Rukhlov, 1998; Radchenko, 1998), 
suggesting that similar factors may influence the 
abundance of different Pacific salmon species.  
Judging from the literature, the most significant 
factors are: climate regimes, food competition, 
fishery pressure, and ecosystem rearrangements of 
biological communities (Radchenko and 
Rassadnikov, 1991; Shuntov et al., 1997; 
Klyashtorin, 1998; Klyashtorin and Rukhlov, 1998; 
Bugaev and Dubynin, 2002).

There are two important points regarding the 
influence of global physical factors on production 
and size of salmon catches.  First is the influence of 
the quantity of atmospheric condensation and air 
temperatures, especially during the winter period in 
spawning areas.  Second is the influence of 
atmosphere circulation through change in the scheme 
of the mass transfer of water in areas of forage 
migration during the sea period of salmon.  In 
ontogenesis, salmon are influenced by various 
natural factors that influence orientation and 
production.  Changes in water mass transfer in the 
North Pacific sector and increases in zooplankton 
production are some of principal causes of changes 
in salmon production.  During the periods of a more 
southern position of the subarctic front and intensive 
distribution to the south of the subarctic waters, 
annual catches of all species of salmon are higher 
than average. 
 
Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) 
Walleye pollock are a highly valuable commercial 
species in Russia. They are widely distributed in the 
pelagic zone in the Russian Far Eastern seas. Major 
stocks of are fished in the Okhotsk Sea and western 
Bering Sea. 
 
Okhotsk Sea pollock  
Biology 
Walleye pollock are the most numerous commercial 
fish in the Okhotsk Sea.  During high abundance, 
they occur throughout almost the entire sea, from 
shallow coastal shelf areas to deep-water basins in 
the south and central parts of the sea Fig. 76).  
Walleye pollock have a vertical distribution range 
from the surface down to the lower mesopelagic 
layers.  When abundance is low, walleye pollock are 
restricted to the shelf and continental slope.  
Medium-aged mature pollock are characterized by 
the greatest migratory activity.  During their first 
2 years of life, they remain within their spawning 
areas, while older fish feed mainly in the 
northwestern part of the sea, over the slope of the 
TINRO Basin (Fig. 76).  On the western Kamchatka 
shelf, their reproductive period lasts from February 
until late June, with a peak in March and early April. 
 
In the northwestern areas, the peak shifts to later in 
the year.  In Shelikhov Bay, the spawning peak is in 
late April; in the Taui region, it is from late April to 
early May; on the eastern Sakhalin shelf, it is in early 
June.  Eggs, larvae and yearlings are distributed 
within spawning areas.  Patterns of both spawning 
and early developmental stages are related to water 
dynamics, particularly to quasi-stationary 
anticyclonic eddies that retain eggs and larvae and 
prevent them from being transported over large 
areas.  The areas of walleye pollock concentration 
are also areas where small copepods aggregate.  
Copepod eggs and nauplii are the main food sources 
for pollock larvae and juveniles.  By fall, the young 
fish start to feed on euphausiids, along with 
copepods.  Mature walleye pollock are practically 
euryphagous, although copepods and euphausiids 
remain the primary prey.  Individuals over 60 cm in 
length live mostly near the bottom, leading a 
nektonic way of life, and at this stage, nektonic and 
benthic prey play an important role in walleye 
pollock feeding. 
 
At age 2 years, western Kamchatka pollock begin to 
migrate to near-slope areas, primarily in northern and 
northwestern directions, to the TINRO Basin and 
Lebedev Trench
1
 where they dwell, conducting short 
seasonal migrations until maturation.  Males 
normally mature at 5 years, with an average length of 
35 to 36 cm, and females mature at the age of 6 with 
a length of 37 to 39 cm.  The sex ratio is generally 
1:1, and remains that way until age 6 to 7 years, 
when the percentage of females increases.  In older 
age groups (14–17 years), males are found only 
occasionally, suggesting that females live longer than 
males. 
 
Individual fecundity of the Okhotsk Sea pollock 
varies considerably, ranging from 30,000 to 40,000 
eggs in first maturing females to 1.3–1.5 million 
eggs in older, larger fish.  The average absolute 
individual fecundity is within 150,000 to 270,000 
eggs per female.  Gonads mature in a continuous and 
synchronous manner.  Several medium-aged groups 
(5–8 years) make up the basis of exploitable stock, 
and the proportion of older fish is small.  The 
maximum age of Okhotsk Sea pollock is 21 years, as 
determined from the aging of scales.

Fishery   
Walleye pollock catches in the Russian EEZ are 
given in Table 38.  The largest portion of this catch 
was landed in the Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 78).  The largest 
catches were related to the appearance of average 
and strong year classes. 
Climate and ocean effects 
The population dynamics of the Okhotsk Sea pollock 
has been studied only since the recent commercial 
development of the species.  Beginning in the 1970s, 
walleye pollock abundance fluctuated with a 
regularity related to 11-year cycles of solar activity 
and 8- to 10-year cycles in atmospheric processes.  
Cyclic patterns in the variability of walleye pollock 
abundance are achieved through long-term changes 
in marine ecosystems, and by reorganizations in 
pelagic communities caused by water and heat 
exchange between the Okhotsk Sea and the Pacific

Ocean.  The appearance of strong walleye pollock 
year classes coincides with the extent of moderately 
warm circulations of water.  Stock abundance 
increases along with macro-zooplankton biomass 
during the warming of the Okhotsk Sea.  Such 
periods of warming were observed during global 
climate changes in the middle 1970s, 1980s, and 
1990s.  The main factor in determining the survival 
of the Okhotsk Sea pollock progeny during their 
critical stages of development is the amount of food 
supply available.  The direct impact of climate and 
oceanographic factors (such as storm wind intensity, 
extent of ice cover, and water and air mass 
conditions) on the survival rate at early ontogenetic 
stages, when the strength of age classes is formed, is 
less important. 
  
Bering Sea pollock 
Biology 
Walleye pollock are the most abundant gadoid fish 
species in the Bering Sea. There are reproductively 
isolated populations of the species in the eastern and 
western Bering Sea.  There is evidence that the “basin” 
pollock, which spawn in the deep-water region off the 
eastern Aleutian Islands, and the “shelf” pollock, which 
spawn in shelf areas, belong to independent 
reproductively isolated stocks, with possible genetic 
differences.  Reproduction of the eastern Bering Sea 
pollock takes place in a vast area from the central 
Aleutian Islands (Kanaga Sound) and southeast shelf 
(Unimak Island and Pribilof Islands area) up to the 
north in Anadyr Bay, with the main spawning grounds 
located in the southeastern Bering Sea.  The western 
Bering Sea pollock spawn in the Olutorsky and 
Karaginsky bays (Fig. 76), and adjacent southern part 
of the Koryak coast.  Each large spawning stock 
consists of smaller groups that differ in age 
composition, time of active spawning, behaviour, and 
distribution patterns for feeding and pre-spawning fish. 
 
Biomass of eastern Bering Sea pollock was estimated 
at 8.6 million t;  biomass of western Bering Sea 
pollock was assessed as 286,000 t using echo 
integration midwater trawl and bottom trawl surveys 
in 2002.  
 
The spatial distribution range of both mature and 
immature walleye pollock usually expands 
significantly during their feeding period.  Eastern 
Bering Sea pollock migrate to the northwestern 
Bering Sea shelf and deep-water Aleutian basin.  The 
148 
extent of the eastern Bering Sea distribution in the 
Aleutian basin depends on the population biomass 
and abundance of  “basin” pollock. 
 
Western Bering Sea pollock migrate from their 
spawning area in Olutorsky and Karaginsky bays to 
the northeast, where they are distributed off the 
Koryak coast and in Cape Navarin area in summer 
and fall.  Some older fish are found in the Komandor 
Basin. 
 
Eggs and larvae of the eastern Bering Sea pollock are 
carried away by currents from the spawning grounds 
near Bogoslof and Unimak islands into the Bristol 
Bay and Pribilof Islands area.  Eggs and larvae can 
presumably drift from the Pribilof Islands spawning 
grounds into the northwestern Bering Sea. 
 
Walleye pollock first mature at age 3+ (30% of the 
fish), and at 5 years old the majority of fish (about 
85%) are mature.  Most walleye pollock in the 
fishery are 3 to 8 years old.  Natural mortality 
increases sharply in fish older than 8 to 9 years.  Fish 
of about 24 to 25 years old are extremely rare in the 
Bering Sea population. 
 
Generally, individuals from the northwestern Bering 
Sea are slightly smaller at age than those from the 
southeastern area.  There are certain growth rate 
differences by sex, areas, and year classes. 
 
Fishery  
The walleye pollock fishery started about 1970 in the 
Russian EEZ of the Bering Sea.  During the 1970s, 
walleye pollock were basically fished out in the 
western seas (Karaginsky and Olutorsky bays).  The 
highest catch took place in 1972 when it exceeded 
2 million t. The second highest catch was in 1988 
when 1.3 million t were caught in Russian waters.  
On the western shelf of the Bering Sea (west of 
174°), high and stable catches were observed from 
1976 to 1994.  Catches averaged 273,000 t a year 
(549,000 t maximum). From 1995 to 2002, the 
annual catch decreased 3.2 times (the maximum in 
1999 was 149,000 t). 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
Abundance and biomass of Bering Sea pollock year 
classes vary significantly, depending on climate 
changes and oceanographic conditions during the 
spawning period.  Larval and juvenile survival may 
depend on the direction of currents, activity of 
eddies, frequency of storms, water turbulence, 
temperature and salinity gradients in the upper water 
layer, as well as on food supply.  The drift of pollock 
larvae into the coastal waters of Bristol Bay and 
Pribilof Islands has potentially positive impacts on 
their survival, because in coastal areas, 
oceanographic conditions are more stable and the

food supply is better.  Survival of juveniles and year 
class abundance also depends on how long juveniles 
remain under the ice cover in winter.  Long periods 
of residence under the ice have a potentially negative 
impact on their survival. 
 
Abundance and biomass the Bering Sea pollock 
decreased from the mid-1980s until the mid-1990s.  
A trend of increasing abundance and biomass of 
eastern Bering Sea pollock started in the late 1990s.  
Abundance of western Bering Sea pollock decreased 
significantly in the 1990s, and have remained at low 
levels until the present time. 
 
The possibility of strong year classes is higher in 
relatively warm years, and is connected with a 
relatively strong inflow of the Pacific Ocean water into 
the Bering Sea through the Aleutian Islands passes. 
 
Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) 
Biology 
Pacific herring are widely distributed in the North 
Pacific Ocean.  Their geographic range along the 
Asian coast stretches from the Yellow Sea in the 
south to the Bering Strait and southern Chukchi Sea 
in the north. 
 
Within this area, Pacific herring are subdivided into 
several geographical groups that differ in abundance 
and ecology.  Three main ecological forms of herring 
are known: off-shore (marine), coastal, and lagoon–
lake.  Marine herring are abundant, living entirely in 
oceanic water with high salinity, mainly in the shelf 
area.  Coastal herring are usually confined to large 
bays and gulfs, and are less abundant.  Lake herring 
are restricted to small bays, lagoons and lakes, where 
they reproduce and spend the winter, visiting 
neighbouring marine areas only during feeding 
migrations.  Their biomass is low, estimated at tens 
or hundreds of tons. 
 
There are four populations of marine herring in the 
northwestern Pacific Ocean: the Okhotsk and 
Gizhigin–Kamchatka stocks are distributed in the 
northern Okhotsk Sea, the Sakhalin–Hokkaido stock 
is found in the southern Okhotsk Sea and adjacent 
Japan Sea areas, and the Korf–Karaginsky stock 
lives in the Bering Sea.  There are five populations of 
coastal herring: Korean, Peter the Great Bay, 
Plastun-Nelmin, and Dekastri in the Japan Sea, and 
Anadyr Bay in the Bering Sea.  The number of local 
lake herring stocks is unknown.  Local stocks from 
the bays of northeastern Sakhalin, Terpeniya and 
Aniva bays, as well as from lakes and lagoons of 
southeastern Kamchatka and Hokkaido Island are 
well studied.  At the same time, there are almost no 
data on numerous small stocks inhabiting practically 
all brackish-water lakes and lagoons along the 
eastern Kamchatka coast. 
 
Pacific herring can attain a body length of 44 cm, a 
body weight of 1,090 g, and can live up to 18 years, 
but such old individuals are rare.  Most mature fish 
live 3 to 8 years and have a body length of 25 to 32 
cm.  The size and age of fish may vary, depending on 
ecological conditions, generation abundance and 
fishery pressure. 
 
Lake herring are characterized by a short life cycle, 
small body size and weight, and early maturation.  
These fish spend the winter in brackish waters where 
they also spawn (bays, lagoons, and lakes that have 
connections with the sea).  Local stocks are usually 
named after the lakes they spend the winter and 
spawn in.  They do not conduct long migrations.  
Unlike lake herring, marine herring are larger, spawn 
along the shore on seaweeds such as Zostera and 
Fucus.  They are widely distributed in shelf waters 
during feeding, and spend the winter on the slope 
(150–250 m depth), forming dense slow moving 
demersal aggregations. 
 
Pacific herring are a neritic or coastal fish species, 
and their life cycle is associated with the shelf areas 
and neighbouring slope waters.  Feeding migrations 
of herring are usually 800–900 miles (~1290–1450 
km) at most. 
 
Mature Pacific herring spend the winter in depths 
from 150 to 250 m, usually at temperatures from 1.5 ° 
to 3.5°C in areas 60–400 miles (~96–645 km) from 
the spawning regions.  The most distant wintering 
regions are located in the wide shelf areas of the 
northwestern Okhotsk Sea and eastern Bering Sea.  
Young herring are distributed at depths from 50 to 
200 m, and can be found at water temperatures less 
than 0°C.  Pacific herring usually stay near the 
bottom during the day and move up the water 
column to the surface at night. 
 
Some populations of Pacific herring (e.g., from Peter 
the Great Bay) mature in their second year and at a 
body length of 17 to 20 cm.  However, most mature 
at the age of 3.  Sakhalin–Hokkaido herring mature 
in their fourth year, while Korf–Karaginsky herring 
150 
mature in their fifth.  Usually, it takes 3 to 4 years for 
the fish to mature.  Males mature earlier and faster 
than females. 
 
The fecundity of Pacific herring varies from 9,000 to 
140,000 eggs, depending on the age and size of the 
fish.  Herring populations from the southern areas are 
characterized by a high growth rate and fecundity.  
The average fecundity of Pacific herring from Peter 
the Great Bay is 72,000 eggs, in the western 
Hokkaido region it is 60,000 eggs, and in 
southwestern Sakhalin it ranges from 70,000 to 
87,000 eggs.  Korf–Karaginskyi herring have a 
fecundity of about 60,000 eggs.  Population 
fecundity has annual variations, depending on age 
composition of the spawning stock, and feeding 
conditions. 
 
Pacific herring feed the whole year round, though the 
intensity differs by season. The highest feeding 
activity is observed immediately after spawning.  In 
winter, the feeding rate is low, and increases just 
before spawning time.  Pacific herring feed mainly 
on copepods, eupahusiids, and chaetognaths.  In the 
Bering Sea, they also feed on amphipods and 
decapod larvae.  Fish (sand lance larvae, pollock 
 
eggs and larvae, juvenile herring) are extremely rare 
in herring stomach contents. 
 
The spawning period of different Pacific herring 
populations depends on the geographical area.  In 
Peter the Great Bay, and near the coast of Hokkaido, 
spawning starts in late February–early March and 
ends in April.  Spawning continues until April in the 
southwestern Sakhalin area, from May–June in the 
Okhotsk and Bering seas, and from late June to early 
July in Anadyr Bay and Chukchi Sea.  Spawning 
takes place in brackish water at a temperature range 
from 0 ° to 14 °C, with an optimum temperature of 2 ° 
to 6°C and salinity of 5 to 28 psu for egg 
development.  
 
Pacific herring stocks differ in their abundance.  
Annual and long-term trends in the dynamics of 
herring abundance are similar.  Biomass has 
increased considerably since the early 1990s. 
 
In recent years, the Okhotsk, Korf–Karaginskyi, and 
Gizhigin–Kamchatka populations have been highly 
abundant, and form the basis for the Russian herring 
fishery (Fig. 79, Tables 39 and 40).  Other stocks are 
less important.

Fishery  
It should be mentioned that every year herring 
landings are lower than the Total Allowable Catch 
(TAC), with annual catches not exceeding 60 to 70% 
of the TAC.  This is because only two (Okhotsk and 
Korf–Karaginskyi) of the three potential populations, 
accounting for 95 to 97% of the TAC, are harvested 
commercially.  Only 5 to 20% of the Gizhigin–
Kamchatka herring TAC, estimated at 73,000 to 
97,000 t in 1999–2001, was taken because there is no 
specialized fishery for this fish during its feeding 
period.  It is harvested only in spring on the 
spawning grounds as a bycatch during the fishery for 
the Okhotsk herring stock.  Gizhigin–Kamchatka 
herring catches may also decrease due to a decline in 
stock abundance, which is related to the elimination 
of the highly abundant 1993 year class from the 
commercial stock.  Forecasts for stock abundance of 
Pacific herring have been made, taking into account 
the regularity in the appearance of highly abundant 
generations (Table 40). 
 
Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) 
Biology 
Pacific saury, a subtropical species, occurs in the 
upper epipelagic layers of the North Pacific Ocean.  
In the offshore areas, its range is bounded by the 
Japanese and Kuril islands in the west, North 
American coast in the east, Komandor and Aleutian 
islands in the north, and northern subtropical 
convergence zone in the south.  Pacific saury is 
common in the Japan Sea and southern Okhotsk Sea.  
The species occasionally occurs in the southern 
Bering Sea, and off western and eastern Kamchatka. 
 
Pacific saury reproduce in the Kuroshio Current and 
its extension, the North Pacific Drift, and to the east 
in the California Current.  Spawning is extended, and 
takes place in the South China and Japan seas. The 
species spawns all year round, with a peak in winter–
spring in the Kuroshio, and in spring–autumn in the 
South China and Japan seas.  Average individual 
fecundity is about 16,000 eggs.  Eggs are released in 
small portions and are laid on floating algae. 
 
As a rule, almost all eggs are fertilized.  Embryonic 
development lasts 10 to 15 days, and survival rate is 
30 to 45% by the time of hatching.  The size of 
newly hatched larvae is about 6 mm.  The larval 
phase ends at a body length of about 25 mm, fry 
phase at 60 mm, and juvenile phase at 240 mm.  
Most individuals spawn at body length of 29 to  
30 cm.  Spawning and feeding individuals have 
different distributional patterns.  The main food 
items are: copepods (Neocalanus, Paracalanus), 
euphausiids (Thysanoessa), amphipods, and 
pteropods.  Pacific saury larvae consume mainly 
small copepods (Oncacea, Corycaeus, Oithona, 
Clausocalanus, Paracalanus, Calocalanus). 
 
The maximum length of Pacific saury is 38 cm.  In 
commercial catches, it ranges from 10 to 34 cm, with 
individuals 24 to 30 cm long being the most 
abundant.  No sexual dimorphism is observed.  The 
Pacific saury life cycle is short and does not exceed 
2 years.  One-year-old (7–14 months) individuals 
constitute the bulk of commercial and total stock.

Pacific saury catches increased through the 1980s, 
reaching a maximum in 1990 (Table 41).  Catches 
declined to very low levels in the mid-1990s, with 
the lowest levels since 1980 occurring in 1998 and 
1999.  Beginning in 2000, they increased and current 
catches are similar to those of the early 1990s.

Climate and ocean effects 
Pacific saury abundance depends primarily on the 
conditions within spawning areas, and on survival at 
early ontogenetic stages.  In the ocean, 19-year-long 
natural cycles of Pacific saury high abundance were 
observed, related to the tidal rhythm of the moon.  
Lunar activity affects the position of frontal zones, 
processes of meandering, and the formation of 
eddies.  The Kuroshio path is considered to be of 
primary importance for the reproduction of pelagic 
fishes in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.  Southward 
shifts of the current position normally lead to 
enhanced yields of fish generations, while stock 
abundance decreases in years when the flow 
approaches the coast. 
 
A rise of Pacific saury abundance in the Japan Sea is 
observed during periods of warm winters.  This is 
related to the increase in non-predatory plankton 
biomass, matching with the production of the saury 
larvae.  The decrease in food competition between 
Pacific saury and other pelagic fish is another factor 
for the increase in saury abundance. 
 
In both the Pacific Ocean and Japan Sea, the increase 
in Pacific saury abundance occurs during 
intensification of the Kuroshio, and is related to the 
extent of water warming.  In the Pacific Ocean, an 
intensive meandering of the stream is a necessary 
condition favouring the increase in abundance. 
 
Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) 
Biology 
In winter–spring (December to May), mature Pacific 
sardines are concentrated in the coastal area of Japan 
where they spend winter and spawn.  Small 
 
 
153
immature sardines are concentrated in the subarctic 
frontal zone.  Beginning in April, just after 
spawning, the fish migrate to feeding areas in the 
northern Japan Sea.  Feeding migrations end at 
different times, depending on the length of spawning 
periods, and abundance.  At low abundance, the last 
schools of sardine approach Primorye and Sakhalin 
in late June.  At high abundance, the time of 
migration is prolonged until mid-June, and in this 
case, small first maturing fish are the last to appear in 
the region.  In September, after a period of growth, 
sardines start migrating back to the southern areas.  
Fall cooling of surface layers in the feeding areas, 
resulting from warm water moving off the shallow 
shelf zone, promotes the beginning of sardine 
migration to their spawning regions.  By late October 
–early November, almost all schools of sardine move 
away from the coasts of Primorye and Sakhalin.  In 
December, sardines are distributed in the Japan Sea 
only along the western coast of the Japan.  Across 
their wide distributional range, sardines are found in 
large numbers at water temperatures of 8 ° to 25°C. 
 
Pacific sardines mature at the age of 3+ and body 
length of 17 to 19 cm.  By the age of 4, 99% of the 
fish are mature (Ishigaki et al., 1959; Ito, 1961). 
 
Individual fecundity varies from 39,900 to 318,800 
eggs.  Gonad maturation begins in November, 
gaining intensity from December to February.  
Spawning occurs from March until May.  By the 
beginning of spawning, the majority of females have 
two generations of oocytes which are later released 
in two pools during one spawning period.  Sardines 
release from 24,000 to 27,000 hydrated eggs into the 
surface layer during a single spawning event.  Eggs 
are pelagic, free-swimming, with an adipose capsule.  
Embryonic development lasts 35 to 85 h, depending 
on water temperature.  Sardines spawn at 14° to 
17°C, with a mass spawning at 15.5°C. 
 
Fishery 
Catches increased through the 1980s, reaching a 
maximum in 1989 and 1990 (Table 42).  They started 
to decline in 1991 and by 1995, there was no catch.  
Virtually no sardines have been caught since 1994. 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
Pacific sardines are characterized by a relatively 
short life span.  In the Japan Sea, five to seven age 
groups are found.  In the 1980s, the most numerous 
were fish aged 3+, accounting for 62 to 79% of the 
total catch (Dudarev, 1985).  The sex ratio for Pacific 
sardine caught in the Japan Sea is 1:1. 
 
Five large rapid rises in sardine abundance were 
reported during the last 500 years.  They were 
observed during periods of low solar activity.  These 
periods are accompanied by climate warming, 
favourable for an increase in sardine abundance.  
Shuntov (1982) considered that favourable conditions 
for sardine reproduction were related to a zonal type 
of atmospheric circulation.  The late 1980s proved this 
hypothesis.  During that period, zonal (westerly 
winds) processes prevailed over meridional (north–
south) processes in the atmosphere. 
 
Two periods of high sardine abundance occurred in 
the last century:  one in the 1920s and 1930s and one 
1970s and 1980s.  Temperature and hydrological 
conditions were suitable for the high rates of young 
fish survival.  It is known that favourable conditions 
within the entire ecosystem are essential for a rapid 
increase in sardine abundance.  Observed variability

in sardine abundance on the northern and southern 
spawning grounds was associated with favourable 
warm conditions for reproduction.  In this regard, 
Shuntov (1982) and Davydov (1986) were correct in 
predicting that a 22-year cycle of solar activity, 
resulting in a relatively warm period, would last until 
the early 1990s. 
 
At present, it is difficult to forecast the next rapid rise 
in Pacific sardine abundance.  We suggest that, 
considering the duration of high and low sardine 
abundance periods, the state of the environment, and 
that sardine demographic cycles are species specific, a 
highly abundant generation of Pacific sardine should 
be expected in the second decade of the 21st century. 
 
Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) 
Biology 
Pacific cod are widely distributed in the North 
Pacific Ocean.  Their natural habitat stretches from 
the Yellow Sea through the Japan Sea, the Okhotsk 
Sea, the northern part of the Bering Sea, and along 
the coast of North America to Santa Monica Bay, 
California. The bathymetric distribution of Pacific 
cod is 10 to 50 m, where the young fish concentrate.  
Maximum depths are up to 800 m. Mature fish live 
mainly at depths from 30 to 300–400 m. 
 
As a rule, Pacific cod are not subject to vast 
migrations in the Russian EEZ.  The majority of fish 
dwell in definite local regions, primarily moving 
from deeper depths to shallower areas and back 
during some seasons. The main commercial 
aggregation of Pacific cod in the northern part of the 
Bering Sea in Karaginsky and Olyutorsky bays are 
found above the continental shelf during summer–
fall and above the shelf edge and continental slope in 
winter (Karpenko and Balykin, 2006). 
 
Pacific cod are noted for their large size among the 
ground fishes of the Far Eastern seas.  In the Japan 
Sea, most fish range from 45 to 75 cm in length.  In 
the Okhotsk Sea, along the western Kamchatka 
coast, the species range from 45 to 80 cm in length.  
On the eastern side, the main group of fish ranges 
from 55 to 90 cm in size.  In the western Bering Sea, 
they range from 55 to 95 cm in length.  Males mature 
at 4 to 5 years and females mature at 5 to 6 years.  
The sex ratio of mature Pacific cod is 1:1, although 
males are smaller than females.  Most fish larger 
than 80 cm are females.  Large abundance is one of 
the characteristic features of Pacific cod.  Biomass 
varies from 700,000 to 7,200,000 spawners. 
 
The spawning period and location are connected to 
water temperature.  During spawning, Pacific cod 
avoid regions that have warm near-bottom water 
temperatures > 10°C, as well as cold ones.  In the 
Okhotsk and Bering seas, spawning occurs at water 
temperatures from 1° to 2°–2.5°C and at depths of 
150 to 400 m from February to April (the peak is 
primarily in March).  Pacific cod spawn small eggs, 
1.25–1.3 mm in diameter, on the bottom.  There is no 
adipose capsule in spawn, so its weight is greater 
than the water and the eggs sink immediately to the 
bottom.  The incubation period lasts not more than 
20 days, depending on the water temperature.  The 
larvae are not larger than 3.7 mm and remain near 
the bottom at the site of spawning.  When the young 
fish grow to 20 mm they migrate to the coastal area 
where the temperature reaches up to 15°C.  Here, 
they grow from 40–80 mm in length and then move 
to deeper water.   
 
Unlike the majority of the groundfishes, Pacific cod 
are characterized by great fluctuations in year class, 
which has an impact on catches.  Warm advection of 
Bering Sea water, due to the warm Pacific water, 
influences the dynamics of the Anadir–Navarin and 
eastern Bering Sea cod year class.  
 
According to Vershinin (1987), the eastern Navarin 
cod quantity is inversely proportional to the ice cover 
in the Bering Sea.  In this case, ice cover is an index 
of water enthalpy during the spawning period.  
Actually, the majority of large- and average-yield 
generations appeared in quite hot years, and were not 
numerous in cold years.  However, this relationship 
occurred only up to the end of 1970.  In the 1980s, 
large and small year classes appeared despite the 
large water enthalpy.  Hence, there are other factors 
besides the environment that play an important role 
in year class formation. 
 
Fishery 
Pacific cod have always made up the largest part of 
groundfish catches in the  Russian EEZ.  In the 
1980s, catches of this species were 23,000 t, reaching 
a maximum of about 175,000 t in 1987 (Table 43).  
The largest catches were on the shelves of western 
and eastern Kamchatka, and in the western Bering 
Sea.

Red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) 
Biology 
Red king crabs are distributed along the North 
Pacific Ocean rim.  There are two populations in the 
Okhotsk Sea, one in western Kamchatka and one in 
the Ayan–Shantarsk area.  Populations with low 
abundance are found in the northern Japan Sea, off 
Sakhalin, eastern Kamchatka, and along the Kuril 
Islands.  Within the Russian EEZ, the western 
Kamchatka population is the most abundant. 
 
Productivity of red king crab populations depends on 
a generation yield, growth rate, temperature, size of 
shelf area, food availability, and natural and fishery 
mortality (Rodin, 1985).  Red king crab migrate 
seasonally into the shelf areas in the spring through 
fall.  Crabs spend the winter in the offshore areas at 
depths of 110 to 200 m because of low temperatures 
in the shallow coastal areas. 
In spring, when the near-bottom temperature falls 
below zero in places where red king crabs spend the 
winter, mature crabs begin their migration to the 
coastal zone to spawn.  On their way to the spawning 
grounds, they pass through a cold-water area where 
temperatures sometimes fall to –1.2 °C.  When warm 
patches with a water temperature of up to +4 °C 
appear in those areas, they move within these warm 
cores.  Males and females migrate separately.  Every 
migratory crab pool has its own regional pattern 
(Levin, 2001).  A month after the migration starts, 
males join females in warmer coastal regions with 
temperatures of 2 ° to 4°C.  Males become mature at 
a carapace width of 10 to 12 cm.  Carapaces of large 
males can reach 25 to 28 cm in width.  The smallest 
females with eggs have a carapace width of 8 cm.  
Most females with a 9 cm carapace width are mature 
and carry eggs. 
 
Individual fecundity of females during maturation 
depends on conditions such as food and hydrological 
regime (Rodin, 1967).  Annual egg production may 
vary within a female.  Females carrying different 
numbers of eggs were observed by Sato (1958).  This 
author found groups of females with a carapace 
width up to 15.6 cm having as many as 75,000, 
150,000 and 200,000 eggs per female.  The number 
of eggs is positively correlated with size.  On the 
western Kamchatka shelf, red king crab fecundity 
increases from the north to the south.  During years 
with moderate temperatures, individual fecundity for 
all size groups increases by 4,000 to 25,000 eggs.  
Females keep up to 300,000 fertilized eggs for 11.5 
months.  On the third month of egg care, a new 
portion of eggs appear in the female’s ovaries. 
 
Larvae hatch at 24 to 40 m depth from April to May.  
On the eastern Kamchatka shelf they are transported 
north of the spawning sites.  Larvae with different 
stages of development present different distributional 
patterns by depth and along the coastline.  Larvae, 
hatched near the shore, migrate to deeper areas as 
they grow.  They settle on the bottom in August.  
The largest aggregations of the crab larvae and 
juveniles are found within the coastal zone. 
 
Red king crabs feed mainly upon mollusks, as well 
as on different crustacean species and polychaetes.  
They also regularly prey upon echinoderms, sponges, 
rhizopods, bryozoans, and hydrants, such as Obelia 
(Logvinovich, 1945; Kun and Mikulich, 1954; 
Nadtochij et al., 1998).  
156 
Fishery 
The most complete information about red king crab 
landings in the western Kamchatka area was 
collected during its intensive harvest from 1924 to 
1983 (Slizkin et al., 2001).  In the last decade, the 
annual catch was less than half of the maximum 
annual catch. 
 
Eight relatively high-yielding generations have been 
recruited into the western Kamchatka red king crab 
population during the last 40 years of observations 
(Fig. 80).  These generations appeared every 4 to 7 
years.  In 1993–1994, two high-yielding generations 
appeared, one after the other.  These generations 
were recruited into the fishery stock and were 
harvested in the 1990s until 2000.  Currently, a 
decline in crab abundance is expected due to the lack 
of high-yielding generations. 
 
Climate and ocean effects 
The study of mechanisms affecting productivity 
shows that during cold years, when crab migrations 
to the coastal zone are delayed, females begin 
spawning in the outer shelf areas.  Larvae from those 
females that cannot pass through the cold water 
belt below –1°C, hatch at depths from 80 to 120 m.  
In these cases, severe conditions, as well as larval 
drift to the regions with unfavourable conditions for 
settling (for example, outside the western Kamchatka 
shelf), usually result in higher larval mortality than in 
the moderate and warm years.  Thus, generations 
appearing in cold years are relatively low-yielding.  
In warmer years, larvae hatch in coastal waters, and 
as a result, they aggregate within a 30 to 50 m depth 
where they are successfully transported into eastern 
Shelikhov Bay, which is favourable for their growth.  
Strong year classes appeared in 1958, 1963, 1970, 
and 1971. 
 
In the 1980s and 1990s, only two strong year classes 
of red king crab were observed in the western 
Kamchatka shelf (Slizkin et al., 2001).  During 
1996–1998, an abnormally low number of males and 
non-migrating juveniles were observed.  In the late 
1990s, the most numerous groups were recruits and 
pre-recruits (males with a carapace width of 1.1 to 
14.5 cm).  They were able to effectively replenish the 
commercial part of the stock only until 2001.  In 
future years, a decrease in the number of males 
recruiting into the harvested stock (with a carapace 
larger than 15 cm) will result in a stock decline.

In the 1990s, an unusual behaviour of crabs was 
observed when over half of all males and a notable 
number of females were found in nontraditional 
spawning areas (Slizkin et al., 2001).  This resulted 
in an increased catch of females and non-commercial 
sized males.  Long-term environmental changes, 
together with high fishing pressure, were the basic 
reasons for the unusual spatial distribution pattern of 
the crabs with their aggregation south of 54°N. 
 
An analysis of oceanographic conditions showed that 
in 1998, western Kamchatka coastal near-bottom 
water (15–100 m deep) was cold relative to the annual 
average, while in the outer shelf area (130– 200 m and 
deeper), the water was relatively warm.  Unlike 
previous years, the cold compensatory current in 1998 
prevented the western Kamchatka coastal area from 
access to the West Kamchatka Current warm water.  
As a result, water temperature near the bottom in the 
coastal area was 2° to 4°C lower than in 1997. 
 
In the spring and summer of 1998, abnormal 
oceanographic conditions in the coastal reproductive 
and breeding shelf areas appeared as a result of the 
development and persistence of a cold counter-
current.  These unusual environmental conditions 
caused a number of changes in the distribution and 
biology of bottom organisms.  Permanent cooling of 
the near-bottom water layer along the western 
Kamchatka coast resulted in a red king crab 
migration from the Hairuzovo to Ichin regions in the 
shelf, which, in turn, led to a sharp decline in their 
abundance in the northernmost areas. 
 
Climate, Ocean and Fishing Effects on Key 
Species in the Fishery  
An important question to consider is whether the 
productivity of a stock is affected by common 
factors, which also control the synchronous 
fluctuations of the principal climatic, geophysical 
and biological indices. 
 
In the late 1980s, the annual commercial catch in the 
Pacific was close to 54 million t.  The total catch of the 
five main Pacific commercial species (Japanese and 
Peruvian sardine, Alaska pollock (also referred to as 
walleye pollock), Chilean jack mackerel, and Peruvian 
anchovy) made up 52% of this total (28 million t). 
 
Major species in the commercial catch off the east 
coast of Russia can be placed in two groups.  Group I 
includes Pacific salmon, walleye pollock and 
Japanese sardine.  Group II includes Pacific herring.  
The maximum catch of species in Group I occurred 
in the late 1930s and early 1990s, with the minimum 
catch in the 1960s.  The maximum catch for Group II 
fish occurred in the 1960s, with minimum catches in 
the 1930s and 1990s.   
 
The population dynamics of fish in the first group 
corresponds to the global trend in surface 
temperatures and to large-scale climate indices in the 
Pacific, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
(PDO) and Aleutian Low Pressure Index (ALPI).  
The PDO characterizes an area of low pressure in the 
North Pacific and is considered a basic climate-
forming factor of the region.  Group I fishes can be 
conditionally considered to be “warm-watered” 
because the increases in catch coincide with periods 
of global temperature rise, and with periods of 
prevailing “zonal” Atmospheric Circulation Index 
(ACI), positive PDO, and intense ALPI.  The 
fluctuation of catches, PDO, and ALPI has an 
approximately a 60-year periodicity (Fig. 81). 
 
Group II fishes can be conditionally described as 
“cold-watered” because periods of increased catch 
coincide with lower global temperatures and with 
periods of “meridian” ACI domination, negative 
PDO, and weak Aleutian Lows. 
  
The concept of an approximately 60-year periodicity 
of fluctuations in climate and catches is based on a 
relatively short time series (100–150 years) analysis, 
and an even shorter time series of catches.  Time 
series with a length of hundreds, and even thousands, 
of years are necessary in order to be clear about the 
periodicity in climate changes.  
 
We propose that the modern fluctuations of climate 
and fish productivity will continue to follow 50- to 
60-year cycles.  According to the model production, 
catches of the so-called “warm-watered” or the zonal 
group of fishes, such as Pacific salmon, walleye 
pollock, Japanese sardine and others will decrease to 
about 2020.  After 2020, production will begin to 
increase (Fig. 82).  Catches of the so-called “cold-
watered” fishes, or the meridian group, such as 
Pacific herring, will increase up to 2020 and then 
decrease. 
 
Klyashtorin and Lyubushin (2007) show that the 
increasing trend of global temperatures may change, 
resulting in a declining trend until 2020.

Future Responses 
The processes that regulate yield are very 
complicated and are governed by many factors, with 
climate and oceanographic influences being 
important.  Numerous factors influencing the 
abundance of generations and populations can be 
classified as follows:  (1) cosmophysical and global 
climate–oceanic factors, which form long-term 
periods and epochs;  (2) climate and hydrological 
conditions of a particular year and region;   
(3) biocenological relations, connected with the 
density factor (through food competition);   
(4) predation at different оntogenetic stages;  
(5) population factors, including those with auto-
control;  and (6) anthropogenic impact on the biota 
and environment, including fisheries and 
aquaculture.  Theoretically, it is very difficult to 
forecast trends in the dynamics of marine organism 
abundance because potential factors are numerous, 
and it is hard to assess possible impacts and 
variability within an ecosystem.  That is why regular 
annual monitoring plays an important role in 
forecasting for a commercial fishery. 
 
The current low level of catch in the Far Eastern seas 
fisheries was forecasted (Shuntov, 1986).  This 
period will last for two decades according to the 40- 
to 60-year cycles in climate and the ocean 
environment, and the associated variability in the 
biological structure of ecosystems.   
 
As for the global warming idea, at the present time 
there are no serious grounds to consider it the first 
priority problem, at least, in the next few decades.

unusually cold in the Far Eastern seas.  According to 
long-term climate variability, the 21st century is going 
to be warmer than the 20th century.  Such a scenario 
will favour biological productivity in the sense that 
biological and fish production will increase in the new 
century.  Presently, it is the relatively cold and severe 
environmental conditions that serve to limit fish 
productivity in the Far Eastern seas.

Introduction 
The Earth’s atmosphere is warming.  Air 
temperatures had generally fluctuated over a fraction 
of one degree for centuries, until the 20th century 
when a prominent accelerated rise in air temperature 
was observed (Fig. 83).  This rise was 1°C over the 
past 142 years in the northern hemisphere.  
Temperature stabilized or slightly declined from 
1940 to the late 1970s, and continued to accelerate 
from the late 1970s (Fig. 84).  This rising 
atmospheric temperature trend from the 1970s is 
expected to change the global marine environment in 
the immediate future.  The reasons for the 
atmospheric temperature increase are many, but 
greenhouse gas effects from carbon dioxide 
 
accumulations in the atmosphere have been 
recognized as one of the major causes (Fig. 85, IPCC 
2001). 
 
As the atmosphere warms, a large part of the world’s 
oceans warm, too (Levitus et al., 2000).  The world’s 
oceans went through two distinct warming periods 
during the past 100 years (Fig. 86).  The first
 
period 
of warming occurred from 1920 to 1940 (not shown 
in the figure) and was followed by a
 
period of 
cooling; the second warming period began during the 
1970s.  The heat content of the world’s oceans 
increased by about 2 × 10
22
 joules between the mid- 
1950s and mid-1990s, representing a volume mean 
warming of 0.06°C (Levitus et al. 2000).  The top 
300 m layer warmed 0.31°C while the top 3,000 m

layer warmed by 0.06°C.  Levitus et al. (2000) 
explained that the accumulation of heat content was 
due to a combination of human-induced effects of 
atmospheric warming and other natural effects in the 
deep oceans.  Up in the water column where many 
fish live, the main effects of warming in the past 50 
years is due mainly to increased intensity of 
atmospheric circulation patterns. 
 
Another natural effect of warming, though minor by 
comparison to atmospheric temperature, is 
underwater volcanic activities.  They are known to 
be actively contributing some heat to the oceans, but 
mainly in the deep oceans, and especially around the 
“Pacific Rim Ring of Fire” region.  Even under the 
Arctic Ocean, there is more hydrothermal activity 
than previously realized.  This activity was 
discovered by researchers aboard two icebreakers, 
the USCGC Healy and the German PFS Polarstern, 
in an international expedition in the Arctic in 2001, 
known as AMORE (Arctic Mid Ocean Ridge 
Expedition).  The scientists found surprisingly strong 
magmatic activity over the Gakkel Ridge, a gigantic 
volcanic mountain chain stretching beneath the 
Arctic Ocean (Edmonds et al., 2003).  Hydrothermal 
hot springs on the seafloor were far more abundant 
than first predicted.

The ocean and atmosphere interact together in 
complex ways to produce what we know as climate.  
Owing to its large mass, the ocean acts as the 
“memory” of the Earth’s climate system and can store 
heat for long periods of time – for decades or even 
longer.  As the water temperatures rise and 
atmospheric forces change, the ocean environment 
and its ecological processes are expected to change, 
thus affecting living marine resources (LMRs).  While 
some of the features of these changes can be 
determined, for the most part, they are still 
unpredictable.  This is particularly true when relating 
climate to ecosystem structure, since physical–
biological coupling is non-linear, and the biological 
response is an integrated process of many physical 
signals from a number of time and space scales and 
sources.  In addition, the impacts of higher 
temperatures on LMRs would get “integrated” into the 
impacts of other environmental changes and events 
that simultaneously take place in the oceans.  The 
effects of climate change are expected to vary from 
species to species and within different ecosystem 
settings.  While changes are likely to occur for all the 
species, the purpose of this report is to pick key 
species groups that will illustrate the effects of some 
potential changes to Alaskan ecosystems. 
 
The species groups addressed in this report are among 
the more important commercially harvested species 
off Alaska:  Pacific salmon, Pacific herring, dominant 
groundfish species, flatfish, crabs, and shrimps.  These 
species generally account for more than 95% of all 
commercially harvested fisheries off Alaska and about 
50% of all catches for the entire United States (NMFS, 
1999).  Since this report focuses on fisheries 
resources, the potential impacts of climate change to 
the lower trophic level organisms, and apex predators, 
such as marine mammals and seabirds, are not 
addressed.  Climate changes that affect these resources 
can have indirect impacts on fish through bottom-up 
or top-down forcing. 
Large Marine Ecosystems off Alaska 
Three large marine ecosystems are relevant to this 
report: the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), the Bering Sea–
Aleutian Islands (BSAI), and the Arctic ecosystems 
(Fig. 87).  The GOA is exposed to the ocean 
environment of the central North Pacific Ocean.  The 
dominant circulation in the GOA is characterized by 
the cyclonic flow of the Alaska Gyre (Fig. 88).  The 
circulation consists of the eastward-flowing 
Subarctic Current System at about 50°N and the 
Alaska Current System.  The Alaskan Stream and the 
nearshore Alaska Coastal Current flow westward 
along the northern GOA.  Large seasonal variations 
in freshwater input and wind-stress curl in the GOA 
affect current speeds, meanders of the Alaskan 
Stream, and eddies of nearshore areas.  It is the 
variations in these flows and eddies at the nearshore 
environment that affects a large part of the biological 
variability of the region. 
 
The Bering Sea is a semi-enclosed high-latitude sea.  
It has a broad continental shelf that is one of the most 
biologically productive areas in the world.  A special 
feature of the Bering Sea is ice coverage over most 
of its eastern and northern continental shelf during 
winter and spring.  A dominant ocean circulation 
feature is the passage of North Pacific water (the 
Alaskan Stream) into the Bering Sea through the 
major passes in the Aleutian Islands (Fig. 88).  There 
is net water transport eastward along the north side 
of the Aleutian chain, and northward at the 
continental shelf break and at the eastern perimeter 
of Bristol Bay.  Bering Sea water eventually exits 
northward through the Bering Strait, or westward 
and south along the Russian coast, entering the 
western North Pacific via the Kamchatka Strait. 
 
The Arctic region is the farthest north and the least 
understood of the three large Alaska marine 
ecosystems.  It is part of the Arctic Ocean which lies 
almost entirely above the Arctic Circle (66.7°N).  It 
is nearly surrounded by land, and its outlets are the 
Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia, Davis 
Strait between Greenland and Canada, and Denmark 
Strait and the Norwegian Sea between Greenland and 
Europe.  The Arctic Ocean is ice bound most times 
of the year.  Water movement in the Arctic Ocean is 
dominated by the East Greenland Current.  This 
current is strong due to the number of rivers that 
flow into the Arctic Ocean.  The main outflows of 
Arctic waters run through Smith Sound, Baffin Bay 
and Bering Strait.  There is also a circular current in 
the Arctic Basin which is created by water deflecting 
off northern Greenland. 
 
Since so much less is known about the Arctic 
ecosystem, we have focused on the Gulf of Alaska 
and the Bering Sea ecosystems.  Yet, the Arctic 
region is where the greatest changes would be 
expected to take place as ocean and air temperatures 
continue to increase.  Because of this gap in our 
knowledge, we support continued research on the 
Arctic ecosystem.

Fig. 87 The three major marine ecosystems off Alaska: the Gulf of Alaska (the western boundary is 170°W longitude), 
the Bering Sea–Aleutian Islands (BSAI), and the Arctic Ocean.  The Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) are bounded by 
the 200-nautical mile outline of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone.  The boundaries between the LMEs are, in reality, 
fuzzy.  Generally, the Bering Strait separates the Chukchi and Bering Sea LMEs and the 170°W longitude (below the 
Aleutians)  separates the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska LMEs. 
 
Environmental Regimes 
The North Pacific Ocean has experienced different 
climatic regimes and shifts in modern times.  Regime 
shifts imply changes in the characteristic behavior of 
the physical environment.  These shifts could be 
caused by a combination of factors, but a persistent 
increase in ocean and atmospheric temperatures is 
the important factor, as well as shorter-term 
perturbations related to climatic events.  A basin-
wide shift in climate regimes in the North Pacific 
appears to have resulted from changes in 
atmospheric forcing which strongly affect sea 
surface temperatures.  There are two principal modes 
of remotely forced sea surface temperature 
anomalies acting in the North Pacific Ocean, the 
shorter-term El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
events and the longer-term Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation (PDO) events (Mantua et al. 1997). 
The question posed by the United States to PICES of 
whether the North Pacific marine environment has 
shifted to a different state or regime since the late 
1980s resulted in a publication by King (2005). The 
report indicates that the environment of the North 
Pacific marine ecosystems has apparently shifted a 
few times.  It follows that the features of the living 
marine resources of the regions have also changed 
over time.  King (2005) cited several examples of 
decadal-scale changes in biological production and 
community composition that occurred around 1977 
and in the 1990s.  
 
A chronology of inter-decadal climatic changes 
affecting the North Pacific Ocean, from measured 
atmospheric pressure and air temperature data from 
the late eighteenth century, was compiled by Minobe 
(1999).  He speculated that the first “recorded” 
regime shift occurred in 1890.  This was followed by

several regime shifts, with each regime lasting 22 to 
34 years.   The scientific literature now generally 
recognizes that regime shifts occurred in 1925, 1947, 
1977 and 1989.  Regime shifts are not confined to 
the last 100 years. Paleo-ecological records show 
that regime shifts have occurred throughout the 
centuries but that the duration of detectable regimes 
have diminished from 50–100 years to 20–30 years 
and even to 10 years in most recent history.  
 
More recently, the environmental regime of the 
North Pacific Ocean has been widely recognized to 
have shifted in 1976/77.  The climate shift was 
associated with an abrupt transition from a negative 
to a positive phase of the PDO.  Significant changes 
appear to have occurred for the ocean environment 
and the LMRs.   Hare and Mantua (2000) assembled 
and examined 100 environmental time series (31 
climatic and 69 biological) for evidence of biological 
and physical responses to these regime shift signals.  
They presented examples which illustrate that such 
signals were more evident in some areas than others. 
For example, the GOA environment does not appear 
to have shifted as much as the Bering Sea, and 
conditions appeared to have returned to near normal 
with less year-to-year variability. 
 
Warming Influence on the Physical 
Environment 
Temperature anomalies in the GOA and Bering Sea 
illustrate a relatively warm period in the late 1950s 
followed by cooling, especially in the early 1970s, 
and then followed by a rapid temperature increase in 
the latter part of that decade.  Since 1983, the 
temperature difference between the GOA and Bering 
Sea has jumped from about 1.1°C to about 1.9°C 
(U.S. GLOBEC, 1996).  Subsurface temperature 
anomalies for the coastal GOA (GAK1, 60°N, 
149°W) also show a change from the early 1970s to 
the 1980s similar to that observed in the sea surface 
waters (U.S. GLOBEC, 1996).  
  
 
169
Changes in ocean temperature on a shorter time basis 
can be quite variable, and often can mask long-term 
trends in ocean warming.  Actual measurements of 
average summer water temperature in the Bering Sea 
recorded from 329 standard trawl stations sampled 
by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) 
crab–groundfish trawl surveys from 1982 to 2004 
show this pattern (Fig. 89, upper panel).  Over this 
22-year period, the variation between the lowest and 
highest average surface temperatures was 4.88°C. 
However, there was a dramatic increase in surface 
temperature from a low of 3.69°C in 1999 to 8.24°C  
in 2004,  a difference of 4.55°C in 5 years.  The 
average bottom water temperature was steadier, and 
increased by 2.64°C over the same 5-year period.  In 
the GOA, water temperatures recorded from the 
NMFS trawl surveys are both higher at the surface 
and near the sea bottom than the corresponding 
temperatures in the eastern Bering Sea (Fig. 89, 
lower panel).  This is probably due to the winter ice 
cover in the Bering Sea.  In areas of the GOA NMFS 
bottom trawl survey, where the bottom depths are 
less than 50 m, the bottom temperature has increased 
from 1984 to 2005 (Martin, 2005).  At all other 
surveyed depths, the bottom temperature in the GOA 
has not shown a trend (Martin, 2005).

How will these higher temperature variations 
manifest themselves on the LMRs on a short-term 
basis and how would they mask the longer term 
effect of a gradual warming of the oceans on these 
same resources?  These are important distinctions 
that may be difficult to determine.  We tend to use 
large-scale climate indices to integrate and serve as 
proxies of environmental change in ecological 
conditions over time, but we know that short-term 
variability can mask and overwhelm some longer 
term trends.  Thus, the response of ecological 
processes to longer term climatic warming can be 
difficult to determine. A fundamental conclusion 
from these indices is that no single index can 
adequately relate the complexities of climate 
variability in the diverse physical and ecological 
regions of the North Pacific.  Thus, there is a need to 
review a wide range of variables. 
 
Changes to the Climatic Environment 
Gulf of Alaska   
In general, climatologists have reasoned that a 
warming trend of the atmosphere over the North 
Pacific Ocean, especially at higher latitudes, would 
serve to decrease the meridional thermal gradient 
between northerly and southerly latitudes, and cause 
a more sluggish atmospheric circulation.  This would 
result in an increase in absolute humidity, a decrease 
in storm intensity, and a northward shift in the storm 
track.  The humidity increase would increase coastal 
precipitation.  Some major ocean circulation effects 
that would follow an expected northward shift in the 
average line of zero wind stress curl, which separates 
the subarctic and subtropic gyres, are the weakening 
and northward shift of the core of the eastward 
flowing West Wind Drift and the northward shift of 
its bifurcation into the Alaska and California 
Currents.   
  
With warming of the central North Pacific Ocean, 
the GOA is expected to have decreasing winter storm 
intensity and corresponding decreases in the input of 
positive vorticity (which drives the total flow) that 
could consequently diminish both the average 
northward transport in the Alaska Current and the 
westward transport in the Alaskan Stream.  Other 
consequences in the central Gulf are expected to be 
less upwelling and less mixing, resulting in a 
shallower but warmer mixed layer tending to 
increase stratification. 
Near the coastlines of the GOA, the expected added 
precipitation and glacial-ice-melt induced runoff 
would increase the nearshore sea surface water 
stratification even more.  As temperatures warm, 
more of the increased winter precipitation would fall 
as rain, shifting the present fall maximum in river 
runoff earlier in the year closer to the time of 
maximum wind stress.  Although the increased fresh 
water would add to the baroclinic structure, the 
decrease in wind stress along the coast would 
weaken the confinement of fresh water along the 
coast, thus weakening the baroclinic gradient and the 
Alaska Coastal Current. 
  
The postulated reduction in strength of the Alaska 
Coastal Current would affect the transport of 
nutrients along the shelf, and diminished 
downwelling on the shelf would tend to reduce the 
cross-shelf flux of nutrient-poor waters at upper 
levels.  This mechanism would be counteracted by 
less mixing by wind.  Thus, there would be an 
unknown net effect on nutrient concentrations over 
the shelf.  The timing of the spring bloom would 
probably occur earlier since the water would be 
warmer, and the formation of the spring mixed layer 
could be earlier.   
Bering Sea–Aleutian Islands  
The expected effects of a warming ocean 
environment should be greater in the Bering Sea 
where the presence of sea ice is a major contrast 
from the GOA.  The warming in the Bering Sea is 
also expected to be greater due to the positive 
feedback from less snow cover and sea ice, hence a 
lower albedo.  Changes in the atmosphere which 
drive the speculated changes in the ocean include 
increases in air temperature, storm intensity, storm 
frequency, southerly winds, humidity, and 
precipitation.  Expected increases in precipitation 
plus snow and ice melt would lead to an increase in 
freshwater runoff.  The only decrease would be in 
sea level pressure which is associated with the 
northward shift in the storm track.  Although the 
location of the maximum in the mean wind stress 
curl will probably shift poleward, how the curl is 
likely to change is unknown.  It is the net effect of 
the storms that largely determines the curl and there 
is likely to be compensation between changes in the 
frequency and intensity of the storms. 
  
Ocean circulation decreases are likely to occur in the 
major current systems:  the Alaskan Stream, Near 
 
171
Strait Inflow, Bering Slope Current, and Kamchatka 
Current.  Competing effects of ocean variables on 
currents make changes in the Unimak Pass inflow, 
the shelf coastal current, and the Bering Strait 
outflow unknown.  Changes in hydrography should 
include increases in sea level, sea surface 
temperature, shelf bottom temperature and basin 
stratification.  Decreases should occur in mixing 
energy and shelf break nutrient supply while 
competing effects make changes in shelf 
stratification and eddy activity unknown.  Ice extent, 
thickness, and brine rejection are all expected to 
decrease.  The thawing and loss of sea ice would 
have great effects on the timing and scale of 
biological events and processes in the Bering Sea.  
As sea ice coverage retreats northward and at earlier 
periods, ocean circulation would be affected which 
would trigger changes in biological productivity in 
unknown ways. 
 
The Arctic  
The Arctic is predicted to be the most affected of the 
three Alaska ecosystems, by warming trends 
according to a 4-year scientific assessment of climate 
change to the Arctic Ocean conducted by an 
international team of 300 researchers for the Arctic 
Council of eight nations (ACIA, 2004).  Warming at 
the more northerly latitude is enhanced by positive 
feedback.  Snow and ice reflect 80 to 90% of solar 
radiation back into space, but when these white 
surfaces disappear, more solar radiation is absorbed 
by the underlying land or sea as heat. This heat, in 
turn, melts more snow and ice.  
 
The Arctic may lose 50 to 60% of its ice distribution 
by 2100 according to the average of five climate 
models run by the scientists from the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 
2001).  This prediction has been based on the Arctic 
projections of the IPCC’s “middle scenario”, where 
gas emissions are double their pre-industrial level.  
Another reason for the Arctic’s environmental 
sensitivity is that the air there is extremely dry 
compared to air at lower latitudes.  This means that 
less energy is used up in evaporating water, leaving 
more as heat. 
 
Since the northern ice cap is warming at twice the 
global rate, there would be serious consequences for 
the planet, although there may also be benefits.  
These consequences include substantial rises in sea 
level on a global scale.  Locally, there would be 
drastic changes to physical, ecological and human 
systems. How these changes would interact are the 
research goals of the Arctic Climate Impact 
Assessment Project.   
  
The loss of sea ice in the Arctic and Bering Sea 
LMEs is anticipated to have great consequences to 
the timing and scale of biological events which 
would trigger downstream implications to all the 
organisms in the ecosystems.  Thus, there would be 
anticipated changes to the components and dynamics 
of the species. The ecosystems will be undergoing 
change and transition as ocean conditions change 
until some order of stability is reached for the 
physical dynamics of these two large LMEs.  
 
Warming Influence on the Biological 
Environment:  Key Species  
The species groups addressed in this report include 
some of the more important commercially harvested 
species off Alaska:  Pacific salmon, Pacific herring, 
some dominant groundfish species (like walleye 
pollock and Pacific halibut), and shellfish.  They are 
described briefly below.  For more comprehensive 
descriptions of these and other living marine 
resources in the region see NMFS (1998, 1999, 
2004).  The potential impacts on marine fish species 
in the Arctic region will not be addressed as little is 
known of these resources.  The ACIA (2004) report 
on the “Impacts of a Warming Arctic” addresses 
impacts mainly to terrestrial animals and, in the case 
of marine species, only to marine mammal and 
seabird resources. 
 
Pacific Salmon  
Five species of Pacific salmon rear in the GOA and 
Bering Sea.  All spend the majority of their ocean 
life in offshore pelagic waters, bounded by brief 
periods of migration through coastal areas as 
juveniles and returning adults.   
Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) 
Fishery and biology 
Pink salmon are the most abundant species of Pacific 
salmon in Alaska (Fig. 90), accounting for 40 to 70% 
of the total harvest each year.  During the past 33-
year period (1970–2003), pink salmon have 
comprised 58% of the average annual commercial 
harvest of salmon in Alaska.  They are harvested 
mostly in southeastern, south-central, and Kodiak 
Island regions of the state (Eggers, 2004).

The life history cycle of pink salmon is unique as the 
species always matures and spawns at 2 years of age.  
This cycle is genetically fixed so that spawners in 
even-numbered years are always separate and 
distinct from spawners in odd-numbered years.  
Throughout much of its range the species has viable 
populations in both odd- and even-numbered years. 
However, in some areas, pink salmon only occur 
mainly in one or the other cycle year.  In Bristol Bay 
and western Alaska, the dominant runs are in even-
numbered years, whereas in the Pacific Northwest 
near their effective southern limit, the runs are 
dominantly in odd-numbered years. 
Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) 
Fishery and biology  
Sockeye salmon are the second-most abundant 
salmon species caught in Alaska (Fig. 91), 
accounting for roughly 27% of the harvest in recent 
years (ADF&G, 2003).  Sockeye salmon provide a 
greater dollar value to fishermen than all other 
commercially caught salmon species in Alaska 
combined, usually yielding from 60 to 70% of 
Alaska’s ex-vessel value of the annual salmon 
harvest.  In more recent years, however, world 
 
173
salmon prices have declined significantly, although 
there was a small price rebound in 2004 which seems 
to be holding.  The largest fisheries for sockeye 
salmon occur in Bristol Bay, Cook Inlet, Alaska 
Peninsula–Aleutian Islands, and Kodiak Island 
regions while other significant fisheries for this 
salmon also occur in southeastern Alaska, Prince 
William Sound, and Chignik regions. 
 
The most common sockeye salmon life history 
pattern shows that juveniles rear in lakes for 1 to 2 
years before migrating seaward as smolts.  The large 
lake complexes on Bristol Bay rivers provide this 
necessary life history component and form a critical 
part of the important fishery in this region.  The 
Bristol Bay fishery is concentrated in a narrow 
window of time from late June until mid-July when 
millions of returning adult sockeye salmon pour into 
Bristol Bay rivers from the ocean.  
 
During a 5-year period (1992–1996), returns to 
Bristol Bay ranged from 29.6 to 44.4 million fish and 
averaged 36.5 million sockeye salmon per year.  The 
return to Bristol Bay in 1997, however, was only 
18.9 million, with a fishery harvest of 12.1 million.  
This unexpectedly low return of sockeye salmon 
created a serious shortfall in the catch and incomes 
of fishermen and communities. 
 
As bad as the 1997 sockeye salmon harvest in Bristol 
Bay was, commercial landings in 1998 were even 
worse, with a harvest of only 10 million fish.  
Returns improved somewhat in 1999 and 2000, with 
commercial catches of 26.1 and 20.5 million sockeye 
salmon, respectively.  More recently, the returns 
have declined again, with commercial catches of 
only 14.2, 10.7, and 14.9 million fish, respectively, 
in 2001, 2002, and 2003 (ADF&G, 2003).  All of 
these recent harvest levels of sockeye salmon in 
Bristol Bay are well below previous decadal 
averages. 
 
Several hypotheses have been suggested by Dr. Bill 
Heard (NMFS, Auke Bay Lab., pers. comm.) to 
explain recent shortfalls of sockeye salmon returning 
to Bristol Bay.  One hypothesis is that unusually 
warm, calm weather during summers has resulted in 
high water temperatures causing high mortality and 
changes in migration behavior of adult salmon 
entering the bay.  Other possible causes include 
changes in freshwater or ocean rearing conditions that 
affect growth and survival of juveniles or immature 
adults, increased predation at sea, interception by 
other fisheries, disease, and in some instances over-
escapements on spawning grounds.  The true causes of 
these shortfalls, which likely involve a combination of 
many factors, remain unknown.   
 
Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) 
Fishery and biology  
Over a 33-year period (1970–2003), chum salmon 
have accounted for 10% of Alaska’s salmon harvest 
(Fig. 92).  Over the past 8-year period (1996–2003), 
the average annual chum salmon harvest across 
Alaska was 18.6 million fish, with the 2000 harvest 
well above this average, at a record 24.3 million fish 
(ADF&G, 2003).  Currently, 60 to 70% of the 
commercially harvested chum salmon in Alaska 
occur in southeastern Alaska where hatcheries 
produce a significant portion of the catch. 
 
Chum salmon runs in southwestern and western 
Alaska similar to sockeye salmon in Bristol Bay, 
have been well below long-term averages since 
1995.  Management of chum salmon fisheries in 
western Alaska is complicated by another 
commercial fishery at False Pass in the Aleutian 
Islands.  Western Alaska chum salmon may spend 
part of their ocean life in the GOA.  As maturing 
adults on their return migration, they funnel through  
the Aleutian passes into the Bering Sea.  The False 
Pass fishery targets primarily sockeye salmon 
returning to Bristol Bay and must be managed to not 
over-harvest chum salmon destined for the 
Kuskokwim and Yukon Rivers in western Alaska.  
The Alaska Board of Fisheries has placed major 
restrictions on the False Pass fishery in an effort to 
help rebuild depleted chum salmon resources in 
western Alaska.  Chum salmon in western Alaska not 
only are an important part of commercial fisheries in 
that region but are also a significant subsistence 
resource for local residents. 
 
Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) 
Fishery  
Commercial catches of coho salmon across Alaska 
totaled 4.1 million fish in 2003, 0.5 million less than 
the recent 6-year average harvest levels of 4.6 
million fish ( ADF&G, 2003), but still well above the 
record low catches in the 1970s (Fig. 93). This 
relatively high commercial harvest was due to 
generally favorable returns in southeastern Alaska 
174 
where 3 million or more coho salmon from hatchery 
and wild stock production were caught in 4 out of the 
last 6 years. Coho salmon, along with sockeye and 
chinook salmon, are popular target species in 
recreational fisheries throughout Alaska. 
 
Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) 
Fishery and biology 
The annual commercial harvest of chinook salmon  
in Alaska has ranged between 300,000 and 700,000 
fish over the past two decades (Fig. 94).  The 
statewide 13-year (1991–2003) average annual 
harvest was 559,000 fish (ADF&G, 2003).  In 
general, chinook salmon are the first species each 
year to begin spawning migrations into Alaska 
rivers. Only in a few Bristol Bay and western Alaska 
rivers are fisheries permitted to directly target these 
early returning runs.  However, in fisheries targeted 
on other salmon, chinook salmon are often taken 
incidentally.

The region-wide chinook salmon harvest in southeast 
Alaska, where significant numbers of non-Alaska 
origin fish are caught, is normally regulated by a 
quota under provisions of the Pacific Salmon Treaty. 
 
Effects of Climate Change on Pacific Salmon 
in the Fishery  
Pacific salmon range over the entire North Pacific 
from 40°N to well over 65°N, or higher, in ice-free 
areas.  The different species have survived over 
thousands of years and seem to have great 
adaptability to climatic changes in order to survive 
and perpetuate.  The life history of salmon has both 
marine and freshwater phases.  Their survival is 
strongly determined by events in their freshwater life 
phases where they spawn and where eggs and smolts 
are nurtured in streams and lakes before they go to 
sea.  Many human activities impinge upon this phase 
of their life cycle and the phase when adults struggle 
to reach their natal spawning grounds.  The effects of 
urbanization and other human activities on land, in 
fresh waters, and nearshore waters would seem to 
have a greater impact on the future of salmon than 
would ocean warming and other climatic changes in 
the marine phases of their life. 
 
Figure 95 (provided by Dr. Nathan Mantua, Univ. of 
Washington, pers. comm.) shows the typical Pacific 
salmon life cycle in the Pacific Northwest and how 
atmospheric warming and other environmental changes 
could affect various phases of their life cycle.  Similar 
impacts are also expected for salmon stocks off Alaska.  
The diagram states that oceanic and atmospheric 
warming will increase snow melt and increase 
fall/winter floods and water flows which would affect 
salmon eggs laid in gravel beds.  In the following 
summer, when the smolts are in streams, higher 
summer temperatures could diminish the oxygen 
content of the water and increase salmon mortality.  
Warmer temperatures could also affect smolt migration 
and increase timing mismatches with their zooplankton 
prey base, essential as the smolts enter salt water.  It is 
hypothesized that salmon survival is determined early 
in its marine life when mortality is high.   
 
In the oceans, changes to the salmon food web and 
supply could negatively or positively affect survival 
and growth of salmon.  Figure 95 only illustrates 
where changes would likely take place; actual 
impacts at these various life phases are difficult to 
quantify.  It appears, however, that negative impacts 
of atmospheric warming should be more strongly felt 
in the freshwater environment than in the marine 
environment.  Still, it may be surmised that Pacific 
salmon may have great adaptability to climatic 
changes, as the species has lasted over so many 
centuries over such wide latitudinal and geographical 
ranges that encompass great variations in their 
environment and food webs.  
 
On a historical perspective, Alaskan salmon 
production from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s has 
been increasing and is at near all-time highs.  This 
may be attributed to changes in ocean and 
atmospheric conditions that increased survival, as well 
as enhanced hatchery releases (Beamish and Bouillon, 
1993; Ishida et al., 1995; Mantua et al., 1997; 
Coronado and Hilborn, 1998).  These increasing catch 
trends of the various salmon species are shown in 
Figures 90 to 94.  The increased production in some

cases, however, was accompanied by a decrease in 
average salmon weight at maturity from 1975 to 1993 
for some sockeye, pink, and chum salmon stocks in 
southeast, central, and western Alaska (Bigler et al., 
1996).  Many scientists believe that these decreases in 
average weight were due to density-dependent growth 
caused by increased competition for food in the 
ecosystem (Ishida et al., 1993; Pyper and Peterman, 
1999).  The decreasing average size trend for the 
salmon species, however, was not apparent for the 
northern (Arctic–Yukon–Kuskokwim) stocks.  In 
addition, the general decreasing trend in average 
salmon weight for the species off Alaska appears to 
have leveled off within the last 5 years. 
 
Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) 
Fisheries and climatic influences 
Research and management of Pacific herring 
fisheries off Alaska are the responsibilities of the 
Alaska Department of Fish and Game.  There are 
three main areas where Pacific herring (Clupea 
pallasii) are harvested commercially: Prince William 
Sound (PWS), southeast Alaska, and the Togiak 
district. 
 
Prince William Sound herring 
Strong recruitment events occurred in this area 
approximately every 4 years in the 1980s (Fig. 96).  
The recruitment of age-3 fish from the 1984 and 1988 
year classes were particularly large (~ 1 billion fish in 
1987).  The pre-fishery run biomass estimate peaked 
in 1988 and 1989 at more than 100,000 t (biomass is 
not shown but is inferred from Fig. 96). The 1993 
biomass dropped to less than 30,000 t (Marty et al., 
2003).  This stock collapsed and the biomass from 
1993 to 2004 has remained at levels less than half of 
the 1980 to 1992 average of 84,000 t. 
 
The PWS Pacific herring fishery is managed to allow 
harvest of less than 20% of the biomass above a 
spawning biomass threshold of 20,020 t.  Since the 
stock collapsed in 1993, purse seine sac roe harvest 
has occurred only in 1997 and 1998 (2 out of 13 
years).  The fishery was also closed in the fall of 
2004 and spring of 2005 because the projected 
biomass was under the threshold spawning biomass.

Fig. 96 Age-3 recruitment and total pre-fishery abundance of Pacific herring in Prince William Sound, 1980–2004 
(from ADF&G, 2003; NPFMC, 2004, Appendix D). 
 
 
The variability of Pacific herring recruitment in PWS 
was related to at least three main factors:  large-scale 
environmental factors (Williams and Quinn, 2000), 
smaller-scale environmental factors (Norcross et al., 
2001), and disease (Marty et al., 2003, 2004).  
Disease assessments conducted from 1993 through 
2002 indicated that viral hemorrhagic septicemia 
virus (VHSV) and associated ulcers were related to 
population declines in 1993 to 1994 and 1998.  The 
parasite Ichthyophonus hoferi was related to a 
population decline in 2001 (Marty et al., 2004). 
 
Southeast Alaska herring  
Spawning biomass of Pacific herring in southeast 
Alaska often fluctuated markedly from year to year 
and rarely exhibited consistent, monotonic trends 
(Fig. 97).  Since 1980, seven of the nine primary 
locations have exhibited long-term trends of slightly 
increasing biomass.  One area (Craig) has not shown 
any notable long-term trend, and biomass in one area 
(Kah Shakes-Cat Island) has had a pronounced 
downward trend. There have been major fluctuations 
around these long-term trends, with periods of both 
increasing and decreasing trends over the shorter term.   
 
There does not appear to be clear decadal-scale 
variability of Pacific herring recruit abundance in the 
three widely recognized climate regimes of 1978–
1988, 1989–1998 and post-1998 in the North Pacific.  
The number of age-3 recruits has been estimated for 
Kah Shakes-Cat Island, Craig, Seymour Canal, Sitka, 
and Tenakee Inlet for most years since 1980.  The 
number of age-3 recruits has been estimated for west 
Behm Canal, Ernest Sound, Hobart Bay–Port 
Houghton and Hoonah Sound for most years since 
1995.  Overall recruit abundances were highest in 
1980, 1987, 1991, and 1996.  However, this pattern 
was not consistent across all spawning locations.  
Only one stock, Kah Shakes-Cat Island, showed a 
distinct decreasing trend in recruit abundance over 
time.  The recruit abundance of Sitka herring, the 
stock with the greatest annual recruit abundance, was 
above the 24-year median in 8 out of the last 9 years. 
 
Togiak herring  
Temporal trends in Togiak herring abundance show 
that total abundance in much of the 1980s was above 
the 1978–2003 average, but fell below in 1989 and 
has remained below average since, with the 
exception of slightly above-average values in 1991 
and 1992 (Fig. 98).  The high abundance estimates in 
the early 1980s made from model projections may 
not have been real, as Alaska Department of Fish and 
Game aerial survey data for the same time period 
conflicted with those estimates, showing much lower 
biomass.  This discrepancy has not yet been 
resolved, but the aerial survey data are currently 
being used to “ground truth” for model estimates.  
The present status of the Togiak herring stock has 
been changed from “nominal decline” to “stable” as 
the stronger 1996 and 1997 recruitment enters the 
fishery in greater numbers.

Pacific herring recruitment trends are highly 
variable, with large year classes occurring at regular 
intervals of approximately every 9 to 10 years  
(Fig. 98).  These large recruitment events drive the 
Togiak herring population.  Environmental 
conditions may be the critical factor that influences 
their recruitment strengths.  Williams and Quinn 
(2000) demonstrated that Pacific herring populations 
in the North Pacific were closely linked to 
environmental conditions, with temperature having 
the strongest influence.  It has generally been 
recognized in fisheries science that the larval stage of 
herring life history is the most important factor for 
determining year-class strength (Cushing, 1975; Iles

and Sinclair, 1982).  Thus, ocean conditions off 
Alaska at spawning run time are expected to greatly 
influence the strength of the year class.  A closer 
examination of trends in sea surface temperature, air 
temperature, and Bering Sea ice cover will have to 
be further evaluated to determine their effects on 
herring recruitment. 
 
Groundfish 
Fisheries and biology  
The groundfish complex is the most abundant of all 
fisheries resources off Alaska.  The combined 
exploitable biomass of all the groundfish species is 
more than 23 million metric tons (t) off Alaska; 76% 
is in the BSAI region and the remainder is located in 
the GOA.  The recent (2002–2004) harvest was 2.1 
million t, or 9% of the total biomass.  The rates of 
fisheries exploitation varied by species, but all were 
less than the overfishing rates determined under the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (MSFCMA).  The main species of 
groundfish resources are walleye pollock (Theragra 
chalcogramma), Pacific cod (Gadus macro-
cephalus), yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera), northern 
rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra), Atka mackerel 
(Pleurogrammus monopterygius), Pacific ocean 
perch (POP, Sebastes alutus), arrowtooth flounder 
(Atheresthes stomias), and sablefish (Anoplopoma 
fimbria). 
 
The average eastern BSAI groundfish catch in recent 
years (2002–2004) was about 1.9 million t (Fig. 99), 
taken from the groundfish complex exploitable 
biomass of about 18 million t (Fig. 100).  The 
dominant species harvested are walleye pollock 
(73%),  Pacific cod (11%),  yellowfin sole (4%),  
rock sole (3%), and Atka mackerel (3%).  The rest of 
the species make up 1% or less of the total catch. 
 
In the GOA, recent average catches were 170,000 t 
from 5.2 million t of exploitable biomass (Figs. 99 
and 100).  The dominant species harvested are 
walleye pollock (36%), Pacific cod (25%), flatfishes 
(14%), Pacific ocean perch and various species of 
rockfishes (13%), and sablefish (8%).  The bulk of 
the total groundfish biomass (50%), however, is 
dominated by arrowtooth flounder. 
 
Groundfish abundance for both the Bering Sea and 
the GOA regions are near historically high levels, 
although some are declining, albeit slowly in recent 
years.  Biomass has remained relatively stable and 
catches have never reached their full acceptable 
biological catch (ABC) potential estimated for the 
resources (NPFMC, 2004).  In the BSAI region, the 
ABCs for groundfish total more than 3 million t for 
 
180 
2005 and catches are limited to an optimum yield of 
2 million t under the BSAI Groundfish Fishery 
Management Plan.  While pollock and Pacific cod 
have been harvested closer to their ABCs, all the 
other groundfish species are generally underutilized.  
In the GOA region, ABCs for 2005 total almost 
400,000 t while catches have been 167,000 t.  Thus, 
most of the species, particularly flatfish species like 
arrowtooth flounder, have been underutilized.  Many 
of the species are not harvested because they cannot 
be fully taken without violating other fishery 
regulations of bycatch restrictions on Pacific halibut, 
salmon, and crab species. 
 
Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) 
Fishery and biology 
Walleye pollock (hereafter referred to as pollock) are 
highlighted in this report because of their dominance 
in the catch, and because their life cycle is strongly 
impacted by climatic events.  Pollock produce the 
largest catch of any single species inhabiting the U.S. 
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).  The catch history 
of pollock in the BSAI and GOA is shown in Figs. 
101 and 102, respectively.  The three main stocks in 
the BSAI region, in decreasing order of abundance,

are eastern Bering Sea stock, Aleutian Basin stock, 
and the Aleutian Islands stock.  The eastern Bering 
Sea pollock stock biomass has gone through three 
prominent production cycles as a result of variable 
strengths of recruiting year classes that are believed 
to be tied to climatic events.  There are at least two 
stocks of pollock in the GOA, one originating from 
Shelikof Strait and the other east of Kodiak Island. 
 
Walleye pollock stocks off Alaska are managed by 
NOAA Fisheries, in consultation with the North 
Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC), 
within safe biological exploitation levels, while 
accounting for their ecological roles in the marine 
ecosystem.  The catch levels and areas of fishing 
have been carefully controlled to reduce the risk of 
overfishing and to mitigate food competition with 
Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus,  listed as an 
endangered population in western Alaska and as a 
threatened population in eastern Alaska), and marine 
birds that prey on pollock.  For the Bogoslof Island 
and the Aleutian Islands areas, where both pollock 
stocks are substantially below their long-term 
potential yields, target fisheries for pollock have not 
been allowed in recent years, and incidental catch 
limits have been imposed.  The exception is a 
19,000 t special allocation of pollock by 
Congressional law to the Adak Community in the 
Aleutian Islands area in 2005. 
Climatic Influences 
Pollock are widely distributed throughout the North 
Pacific Ocean in temperate and subarctic waters 
(Wolotira et al., 1993), thus indicating a tolerance for a 
wide temperature range.  They are a semi-demersal 
schooling fish, which becomes increasingly demersal 
with age.  The species spawns in large aggregations at 
depths of 100 to 300 m in many spawning locations in 
the BSAI region.  Spawning schools aggregate to 
spawn adjacent to the Aleutian Islands and over 
182 
Bogoslof Island in late February to early March, and in 
the southeastern Bering Sea in January.  Spawning 
activities of other aggregated schools in more northerly 
locations are progressively later, with some taking place 
as late as May towards the U.S.–Russia maritime 
boundary.  Thus, pollock are protracted open-ocean 
spawners that spawn over a wide geographical space 
and over a few months.  In the GOA, the dominant 
aggregation of spawning pollock is in Shelikof Strait, 
although other spawning aggregations are found east of 
Kodiak Island.  Harvestable adult concentrations can be 
found throughout the GOA, including Prince William 
Sound.   
  
As the eggs and larvae rise and develop, they are 
subject to the vagaries of ocean currents.  Thus, 
pollock are especially vulnerable during the early 
phase of their life cycle, when climatic events can 
strongly determine the success or failure of year 
classes.  The species is relatively short-lived (natural 
mortality estimated at 0.3 years) and is a fast-
growing fish.  Females usually become sexually 
mature at 4 years of age and the maximum age is 
about 22 years.  
  
The effects of ocean currents on the survival of the 
early life stages of pollock have been studied 
extensively in the GOA and the eastern Bering Sea 
by NOAA’s Fisheries Oceanography Coordinated 
Investigations (FOCI) program.  FOCI investigates 
the early life stages (eggs, larvae and early juveniles) 
of the species. Early each spring in the GOA, pollock 
spawn in Shelikof Strait and produce large batches of 
eggs that develop into larvae.  In most years, the 
concentrations of larvae drift to the southwest with 
the Alaska Coastal Current during April and May 
(Fig. 103).  In the Bering Sea, the number and size of 
spawning concentrations are larger than in the GOA. 
Spawning events start in early March near Bogoslof 
Island and along the Aleutian Islands and progress 
eastward and northward, lasting until as late as early 
May.  Pollock eggs and larvae are carried by currents 
into the Bering Sea, generally east and northwards 
towards the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) shelf.  Based 
on model predictions of pollock egg and larvae 
transport (Fig. 104) using the Ocean Surface Current 
Simulation (OSCURS) model, it has been speculated 
that larval survival would be more favorable if the 
larvae are carried onshore towards the EBS shelf, 
where food is expected to be more plentiful, than 
when they are carried offshore.  The FOCI program 
has determined that large numbers of larvae are often 
found in eddies, where feeding conditions are 
favorable.  The program found that first-feeding 
larvae have a higher survival rate during calm sea 
conditions than in storms and that in some years 
recruitment is largely determined by the end of the 
larval period.

It is difficult to speculate how the warming of the 
GOA and Bering Sea would affect the finer aspects 
of current flow and how the resultant ocean 
environment would affect the plankton life that 
pollock larvae feed on when they hatch.  The ocean 
environment would affect a whole sequence of prey–
predator timing events that complicates how 
cascading events on the LMRs would take shape. 
 
There is also the issue of water temperature 
preference for all the LMRs and whether there would 
be a northward shift in the center of distribution for 
pollock.  Since the heat content of the ocean is held 
for a long time and if warming continues, it is likely 
that the centers of distribution for pollock and other 
groundfish species would shift also.  It is too early to 
tell, whereas the shorter term climatic events in the 
GOA and regime shifts have masked any apparent 
shift in distributions. 
 
One apparent shift in the location of pollock 
spawning concentrations appears to be in the vicinity 
of Bogoslof Island.  Surveys conducted by the 
NOAA R/V Miller Freeman from 1988 to 2005 
suggest that high concentrations of the fish that 
aggregated to spawn near Bogoslof Island in the late 
1980s to early 1990s have shifted toward the 
Aleutian Islands, and that the concentrations have 
been getting smaller.  It was unknown if this centroid 
shift is related to changes in the ocean environment 
or to depletion of the stock from intensive fisheries 
in the central Bering Sea Donut Hole area in earlier 
years.  Intensive fisheries took place from 1986 to 
1990 when more than a million metric tons of 
pollock were reportedly taken annually from the 
Donut Hole area.  These fisheries seemed to have 
depleted the Bogoslof Island spawning stock. Could 
depletion of the stock in the Donut Hole area have 
caused the shifts in the centroids of spawning 
concentrations towards the Aleutian Islands?  Could 
this shift be environmentally related?  These are just 
two questions about variability and the mystery of 
species interactions with the environment. 
 
Groundfish recruits per spawning biomass  
As the ocean environment is expected to affect 
recruitment, one way to examine the relationship is 
to evaluate recruit per spawner biomass ratios.  
Median recruit per spawning biomass anomalies 
were calculated for each species to provide an index 
of survival for the BSAI and GOA regions (Figs. 105 
and 106).  In stocks that are abundant, the 
relationship between recruits and spawners may not 
be linear and density-dependent factors may limit 
recruitment.  Under these circumstances, the pattern 
of recruits per spawner will appear as an inverse of 
the pattern of spawning biomass as annual rates of 
production have leveled off.  For this reason, it is 
important to also consider recruitment, as well as 
recruits per spawning biomass.  Recruit abundance 
of each species was lagged by the appropriate 
number of years to match the spawning biomass that 
produced them.  For graphical display, the median of 
each time series was subtracted from the log-
transformed recruit per spawning biomass ratios and 
expressed as a proportion of the median. 
 
Generally, climate regime-scale variability in recruit 
per spawner time series was detected in flatfish and 
rockfish, but not in groundfish (pollock, cod, Atka 
mackerel, and sablefish) species (Figs. 105 and 106).  
The 1988/89 shift was apparent in all winter spawning 
flatfish species in the Bering Sea but not in the GOA.  
Shifts in other flatfish of the Bering Sea were not 
detected, except yellowfin sole which showed the 
1976/77 shift.  A shift in 1988/89 was detected in the

Fig. 106 Median recruit per spawning biomass anomalies for GOA groundfish species assessed with age- or size-
structured models from 1960 to 2002.  GOA = Gulf of Alaska, ATF = arrowtooth flounder, POP = Pacific ocean perch, 
Sable = sablefish (NPFMC, 2004, Appendix D). 
 
survival of two rockfish species (EBS Pacific ocean 
perch (Sebastes alutus) and GOA northern rockfish 
(S.  polyspinis)) and a shift in 1976/77 was detected 
in several rockfish species (EBS POP, GOA POP, 
and GOA thornyhead rockfish (Sebastolobus sp.).  
No shift was seen in the EBS northern rockfish time 
series.  The effect of heavy fishing during the 1960s 
may have influenced the EBS POP recruit per 
spawner biomass ratios. Therefore, the analysis was 
performed on recruits to reduce this effect.  The 
results of this analysis were the same as that for 
recruit per spawners, indicating that there was a shift 
in EBS POP survival in 1976/77 and 1988/89 (no 
shifts were seen in GOA POP recruits).   
 
The results of a non-parametric change-point 
analysis suggest that a linear trend is the best fit 
model for most groundfish species, whereas a 
discontinuity model provided the best fit for most 
flatfish and rockfish species in the BSAI and GOA.  
Primary step changes in recruit per spawner time 
series were found for 12 of the 19 groundfish 
species, 6 of which were significant (p < 0.05).  
There were three general time periods in which step 
changes were detected:  1968, 1974–1979, and 
1987–1992.  Winter spawning flatfish step changes 
typically occurred from 1987 to 1992; most rockfish 
step changes occurred in the mid-1970s and 1980s.  
 
The survival of groundfish does not appear to be 
related to decadal-scale climate variability, as 
defined by the hypothesized 1976/77, 1988/89, or 
1998 years of regime shifts.  Examination of the 
average recruit per spawning biomass anomalies, 
however, indicates that groundfish experience 
similar trends in survival within ecosystems.  For 
example, pollock and cod have similar recruit per 
spawner trends in both the BSAI and GOA 
186 
(Fig. 107).  Aleutian Islands pollock and Atka 
mackerel (not included in this analysis) also show 
similar patterns in recruitment (Fig. 107; Barbeaux et 
al., 2003).  This may be an indication that groundfish 
respond in similar ways to large-scale climate 
changes that are not defined by the years of 
hypothesized regime shifts or are not detected with 
the type of analyses conducted in this study.   
 
Flatfish survival shows decadal-scale variability in 
survival.  In particular, the BSAI winter spawning 
flatfish (rock sole, flathead sole and arrowtooth 
flounder) show a negative shift in survival for the late 
1980s.  Examination of the recruitment of winter-
spawning flatfish in the Bering Sea, in relation to 
decadal atmospheric forcing, suggests favorable 
recruitment may be linked to wind direction during 
spring (Wilderbuer et al., 2002).  Years of consecutive 
strong recruitment for these species in the 1980s 
correspond to years when wind-driven advection of 
larvae to favorable inshore nursery grounds in Bristol 
Bay prevailed.  The springtime wind pattern changed 
to an off-shore direction during the 1990s which 
coincided with below-average recruitment.  Rockfish 
survival also appears to be related to decadal-scale 
variability, but the mechanism is unknown.  Also, 
recruit per spawning biomass ratios are autocorrelated 
in long-lived species, such as rockfish. However, 
analyses on recruits showed similar results as those 
conducted on the recruit per spawning biomass ratios 
for EBS POP. 
 
Flatfish  
Swartzman et al. (1992) noted that the relationship 
between habitat use of EBS flatfish (as measured by 
catch per unit effort (CPUE) from summer trawl 
surveys) and temperature has generally remained 
constant over time.  Paul Spencer (NPFMC 2004, 
Appendix D), however, examined the hypothesis that 
flatfish may shift distributions in order to maintain 
temperature preferences.  Recent bottom 
temperatures in the EBS show considerable contrast 
and thus provide an opportunity to examine the 
relationship of flatfish distributions to temperature 
variability.  For example, 1999 was one of the 
coldest years on record and a warming trend has 
occurred since 2000 such that 2003 was one of the 
warmest years observed.  The average latitude and 
longitude, by year, of the survey stations within the 
“cold pool” (defined as water < 2°C) from the 1997 
to 2003 EBS shelf survey is shown in Figure 108, as 
well as the annual centroids for individual species

only (Spencer, NPFMC 2004, Appendix D). 
 
 
(average latitude and longitude of survey stations 
containing a particular species, weighted by CPUE).  
From 1998 to 1999, the centroid of the cold pool 
moved to the southeast and was at its lowest latitude 
observed from 1982 to 2003.  The warming trend 
since 2000 is revealed in the northwest movement of 
the cold pool centroid such that the 2003 centroid is 
at it highest latitude observed from 1982 to 2003.  
 
The centroids of many flatfish populations, including 
yellowfin sole, rock sole, flathead sole, and arrowtooth 
flounder, also appear to have moved to the southeast in 
1999, presumably in response to cold ocean conditions.  
Scaled time series (1982 to 2003) of the location of the 
cold pool and flatfish centroids follow along an axis 
running from the southeast to northwest EBS shelf 
(NPFMC 2004, Appendix D).  Although most species 
do not show a significant statistical relationship to the 
location of the cold pool over the entire time series, the 
pattern of a southeast movement across several species 
in 1999 is observed in these time series.  This finding 
suggests that flatfish habitat selection is related not only 
to seafloor characteristics, but is also influenced by 
water temperatures. 
A significant relationship was found between the 
centroids of the cold pool and flathead sole from 
1982 to 2003, indicating that flathead sole centroids 
are generally not found in the northwest during very 
cold years.  The diet of flathead sole consists of a 
greater proportion of fish than other small flatfish, 
and one hypothesis is that flathead sole distributions 
may be linked to prey fish populations which, in 
turn, may be related to temperature.  Alternatively, 
another hypothesis is that water temperatures in more 
northwestern areas of the EBS shelf may be outside 
the preferred temperature range for flathead sole 
during cold years.  Additional research will be 
needed to investigate these hypotheses. 
 
Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) 
Fishery and biology  
Pacific halibut are managed separately from other 
groundfish species in the BSAI and GOA. They have 
one of the longest histories of research and represent 
a bottom dwelling flatfish that may be better 
sheltered from extreme variations in climatic 
 
188 
changes, at least after their early life history stages 
when the eggs and larvae drift with the currents.  
This species is found throughout the coastal waters 
of Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon 
and northern California.  Their center of abundance 
is the central GOA, particularly near Kodiak Island.  
Depths for adults range from 50 m during summer 
feeding to 600 m during winter spawning.  Pacific 
halibut are generally found in waters at temperatures 
from 3° to 9°C. 
 
Pacific halibut begin to mature at approximately 
8 years of age.  During the spawning season, generally 
November to March, adults move to deeper waters 
near the edge of the continental shelf.  Halibut are 
broadcast spawners.  Their eggs and larvae drift in the 
surface currents for 6 to 7 months after spawning.  
During this long pelagic phase, halibut generally drift 
westward in the GOA and northward into the Bering 
Sea by the dominant surface currents before settling to 
the bottom in shallow waters in late spring and 
summer.  It is at this long stage when extreme changes 
in climate are expected to have the greatest impact on 
the success of year classes, although in recent years, 
the relative distribution of recruited (i.e., fish 8 years 
and older) halibut biomass by area remains relatively 
constant from year to year.  To achieve migration 
continuity, juveniles migrate back to the south and 
east towards their spawning grounds.  This counter-
migration usually takes place between ages 2 and 6.  
Adults show seasonal migration (to deeper water for 
spawning) but very little directed migration. 
  
A commercial fishery for halibut has existed since 
1888.  During the 20th century, landings ranged 
between 17,000 and 40,000 t.  The current health of 
the fishery is generally good since some of the 
highest landings on record were taken in the last 5 
years of the 1990s.  Since 1995, the fishery has been 
managed under an Individual Transferable Quota 
system.  In addition to the commercial fishery, there 
is a growing sport fishery, and halibut are also 
captured incidentally in other North Pacific 
groundfish fisheries. 
  
Climatic influences  
Climate variability has been shown to affect the life 
history and distribution of Pacific halibut.  During 
the 20th century, there have been dramatic and 
persistent changes in the growth and recruitment of 
the species that cannot be readily explained by 
changes in stock size (Clark et al., 1999).  Over the 
last 15 years, the weight of individual halibut has 
decreased substantially, especially in Alaska  
(Fig. 109).  For example, the modal animal in the 
Pacific halibut commercial catch, an 11-year-old 
female halibut landed in Kodiak, Alaska, averaged 
40 lb (18 kg) weight in 1980.  In 1995, the average 
weight for the same age female halibut was less than 
20 lb (9 kg). Fifteen years ago fish of a given age 
were substantially larger in Alaska than in British 
Columbia; now there is no difference. In both 
respects, Pacific halibut growth is similar to what 
was observed in the 1920s and 1930s.  An increase in 
weight occurred sometime during the 1940s, and the 
present decrease began in the mid-1970s.  Fish are 
also maturing at a smaller size now than they used to, 
while the age at maturity is quite close to what it has 
always been, with 50% of females mature by age 11. 
 
There have also been clear decadal variations in 
halibut recruitment and spawning biomass all 
through the century, or at least since about 1935  
(Fig. 110).  Most recently, there was a run of good 
year classes spawned in the late 1970s to at least the 
late 1980s. This kind of alternation has sometimes 
been viewed as a cycle, but could just as well reflect 
distinct periods of different environmental 
conditions.  Recent work has strongly suggested that 
halibut recruitment is driven primarily by the PDO, 
an interdecadal mode of climate variability.  Stock 
size on its own explains very little of the variability 
in recruitment.  Much of the observed variation can 
be explained either by fitting separate stock 
recruitment curves to different periods, based on the 
PDO regimes, or by simply using the PDO as a 
covariate (Clark and Hare 2002, Fig. 111).  The PDO 
has alternated between positive (productive for 
halibut) and negative (unproductive) phases every 25 
to 35 years (Mantua et al., 1997). 
 
The influence of temperature on early Pacific halibut 
growth was examined by Hagen and Quinn (1991).  
They found that warmer temperatures were related to 
an increase in growth rate for the first few years of 
life.  After about age 3, however, growth rate was 
influenced more by year-class strength, which they 
suggested might be due to density-dependent effects.  
They also suggested that early growth rate was a 
factor in determining year-class strength.  Clark and 
Hare (2002) demonstrated the decrease in growth rates 
of the late 20th century followed the sharp increase in 
stock size, and were most likely a density-dependent 
response.  They found no environmental influence on 
growth rates of fish ages 8 and older.

Climate variability impacts on Pacific halibut have 
mostly concerned the role of ocean temperature.  
Research to date suggests that warmer temperatures 
not only affect early growth rates and year-class size 
but may also have led to a shift in the distribution of 
Pacific halibut.  Clark and Hare (2002) note that 
during the recent positive PDO regime (1977–1998), 
Pacific halibut recruitment to Alaska was 
substantially greater than it was in the earlier positive 
regime (1925–1946), whereas in British Columbia, 
recruitment was about the same, or a bit less, than 
the earlier positive regime.  They speculate that this 
may be a manifestation of warming, as the waters of 
the North Pacific have warmed over the 20th century 
and thus may have shifted the optimal temperature 
range (3°–9°C) to the north. 
 
Pacific halibut population abundance is related to 
conditions established in the upper ocean water layer 
which result from climate influences, including the 
PDO, ENSO, and local climate.  The mechanisms 
determining survival are believed to be operative in 
the initial year of life, likely during the first several 
months following spawning.  The pelagic phase of 
Pacific halibut lasts 6 to 7 months during which time 
the eggs and larvae are transported around the 
Alaska Gyre before settling on the continental shelf 
from the central GOA to the Bering Sea and along 
 
 
191
the Aleutian chain.  Transport distance is linked to 
the rotational speed of the gyre which can vary on 
inter-annual and inter-decadal time frames.  Survival 
of larval and juvenile halibut is intimately tied to the 
ecological and oceanographic conditions in the near 
surface waters during the pelagic phase. 
 
Shellfish 
Crab 
Fishery  
Crab resources are managed primarily by the Alaska 
Department of Fish and Game.  Three king crab 
species, red (Paralithodes camtschatica), blue 
(P. platypus) and golden or brown (Lithodes 
aequispina), and two Tanner crab species, Tanner 
crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) and snow crab (C. opilio), 
have traditionally been harvested commercially off 
Alaska.  As abundances have declined, exploratory 
fisheries on new deep-water stocks of scarlet king 
crab, grooved Tanner crab, and triangle Tanner crab 
have begun, producing only minor landings to date.  
Information on current and long-term potential yield 
is lacking for king and Tanner crabs.  Thus, default 
values are derived from historical average landings.  
Long-term potential yield is represented by catch 
averages; current potential yield is set equal to recent 
average yield, calculated as the most recent 3-year 
average.  The recent average yields for king 
(8,130 t), snow (13,038 t) and Tanner (712 t) crabs 
are below their respective long-term potential of 
36,481, 37,202 and 21,751 t, respectively.  The 
harvest of snow crab has been lower than the long-
term potential since 2000 due to low abundance and  
 
lower harvest rates established under a rebuilding 
plan.  Catches of crabs are restricted by quotas, 
seasons, and size and sex limits, with landings 
limited to large male crabs.  Fishing seasons are set 
at periods of the year to avoid molting, mating, and 
soft-shell periods, both to protect crab resources and 
to maintain product quality.  
 
Catch trends for king crabs are shown in Figure 112. 
Until 1967, Japanese and Russian fisheries 
dominated Bering Sea landings, but those fisheries 
were phased out by 1974.  In the Bering Sea, 
domestic catches peaked at 74,000 t in 1980 and then 
dropped precipitously in 1981.  Since then, the 
catches have remained low.  GOA catches peaked in 
1965 (Fig. 112), then varied at a relatively low level 
for a decade before dropping lower still in 1983.  
Almost all GOA king crab fisheries have been closed 
since 1983. 
 
Tanner crab catch trends (Fig. 113) show that the 
1965–1975 period was a  developmental phase for the 
fisheries.  The catch peaked in 1979 and then declined 
to 1984.  After 1984, the catch increased, reaching an 
all-time high of 168,000 t in 1991, and then decreased 
to 1997, when the Tanner crab fishery was closed.  
Abundance trends for Bering Sea stocks indicate that 
the Tanner crab stock declined from a relatively high 
level in the late 1970s to a low level in 1985.  The 
stock recovered and then declined again subsequent to 
1989, and is currently at a low level.  Snow crab 
rebounded sharply, from a low level in 1985, 
producing large catches in the 1990s, and then 
declined in 1999 to low levels.  Snow crab catch 
decreased from 2000 to 2003 due to low abundance 
(figure not shown).

Abundance  
Abundance of EBS crabs is determined using an 
“area-swept” method in a stratified systematic 
sampling design in an annual NMFS trawl survey 
(NPFMC 2004, Appendix D). Current abundances 
are low (Fig. 114), and of the six crab fisheries 
included in the Fishery Management Plan, two are 
open, four are closed, and four are considered 
overfished.  
 
Bristol Bay red king crab 
The mature biomass of Bristol Bay red king crab was 
highest in 1980, declined, and has remained 
relatively low since 1983.  The total mature biomass 
of crabs has remained above 50% of the maximum 
sustainable yield (MSY) biomass and, therefore, the 
stock is not considered overfished.  Abundance of 
legal and pre-recruit males increased by 10% in 2004 
whereas the number of mature females decreased by 
about 9%. 
 
Pribilof Islands red king crab 
The mature biomass of the Pribilof Islands red king 
crab was well below 50% MSY in the 1980s but has 
been higher than the 50% MSY since 1991 and is not 
considered overfished.  Apparent abundance of large 
male crabs decreased by about 62% in 2004 while 
that of mature females decreased by about 62%.  No 
pre-recruit males were captured.  Although not 
considered overfished, the fishery remains closed 
because of considerable uncertainty regarding 
population abundance, and due to concerns of 
unacceptable levels of incidental catch  of severely 
depressed blue king crab in the same district.   
Pribilof Islands blue king crab 
Blue king crab in the Pribilof Islands area have been 
considered overfished since the mature biomass fell 
below the 50% MSY in 2002.  Abundance of mature 
biomass continued to decrease in 2004 and is now 
the lowest on record.  Little or no recruitment is 
apparent in the population which has been declining 
continuously since 1995.  Continued warm 
conditions in the surrounding waters may be 
contributing to the decline. 
 
St. Matthew Island blue king crab 
Blue king crab in the area of St. Matthew Island are 
also considered overfished.  The population has 
declined steeply since 1998.  Legal and pre-recruit 
male abundances decreased by 11 and 33%, 
respectively, in 2004.  Indices of female crab 
abundances are not considered meaningful due to 
their preference for inshore and rocky untrawlable 
habitat.   
 
Eastern Bering Sea Tanner crab 
The eastern Bering Sea Tanner crab population was 
high in the early 1980s and from 1988 to 1992.  The 
population has been low since then and currently 
continues to decrease due to low recruitment.  The 
mature biomass is below 50% MSY; therefore, the 
stock is considered overfished and the fishery has 
been closed since 1996.  In 2004, the abundance 
indices for legal males (–28%) and mature females 
(–29%) decreased, while that of pre-recruit males 
increased (+25%). 
Catch (1000 MT) 
 
193
Eastern Bering Sea snow crab  
The mature biomass of eastern Bering Sea snow crab 
was moderate to high in the early 1980s and from 
1987 to 1997.  The biomass has declined sharply 
from 1998 to 1999 and the stock is considered 
overfished.  In 2004, the abundance index for 
commercial-sized males (+2%) and pre-recruit males 
(+3.6%) increased slightly, while that for mature 
females increased more substantially (+25%).  A 
small fishery (about 9,500 t) was allowed in January 
2005 under the terms of the rebuilding plan.  
 
Snow crab recruitment was higher during 1979–1987 
than in other years (Fig. 115).  The two highest 
recruitment events occurred in 1980 and 1987, after 
which recruitment was low.  Low recruitment 
estimates since 1988 could be due to fishing, climate, 
and/or a northward shift in snow crab distribution.  A 
northward shift in distribution could result in a 
decrease in reproductive output because snow crab 
may only spawn every other year (rather than 
annually) in colder temperatures, such as those found 
farther north.

Climatic influences 
Stock-recruitment relationships for Bristol Bay red 
king crabs 
Jie Zheng of the Alaska Department of Fish and 
Game (NPFMC 2004, Appendix D) developed the 
spawner–recruit (S-R) relationships for Bristol Bay 
red king crabs using a length-based model.  He 
reported that, in general, strong recruitment occurred 
with intermediate levels of effective spawning 
biomass, and very weak recruitment was associated 
with extremely low levels of effective spawning 
biomass.  These features suggest a density-dependent 
S-R relationship (Fig. 116).  On the other hand, strong 
year classes occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s, 
and weak year classes occurred in the 1980s and 
1990s.  Therefore, recruitment is highly autocorrelated, 
so environmental factors may play an important role in 
recruitment success.  The general Ricker curve (R
2
 = 
0.53) was used to describe the density-dependent 
relationship and the autocorrelated Ricker curve (R
2
 = 
0.45) was used to depict the autocorrelation effects.  
The recruitment trends of Bristol Bay red king crabs 
may relate partly to decadal shifts in physical 
oceanography:  all strong year classes occurred before 
1977 when the Aleutian Low was weak.  The largest 
year class during the last 20 years, the 1989 brood 
year, was also coincidental with the weak Aleutian 
Low Pressure Index (ALPI) during 1989–1991. 
 
Major climate indices and recruitment variation of 
Eastern Bering Sea crabs 
Most crab population fluctuations off Alaska are 
caused by recruitment variability.  The variability is 
expected at the greatest magnitude during the egg 
and larval stage when survival of the crabs is at the 
mercy of the currents.  Zheng and Kruse (2006) 
examined the effects of four environmental factors on 
six crab stocks in the EBS (Fig. 117) that would have 
a strong impact on the ocean conditions, ALPI, PDO, 
proportion of ice coverage, and near-bottom 
temperatures. They compared the trends of crab 
recruitments and these climate indices.  The ALPI 
and PDO showed similar trends, which are opposite 
to that of the ice coverage index (Fig. 118).  All these 
indices exhibit decadal-scale variability.  Among the 
six crab stocks in the same general vicinity of the 
eastern Bering Sea shelf area, Bristol Bay red king 
crab recruitment trends appeared to relate best to 
decadal shifts in physical oceanography: all strong 
year classes occurred before 1977 when the Aleutian 
Low was weak.  The largest year class during the last 
20 years, the 1990 year class, was also coincidental 
with the weak ALPI during 1989–1991.  Specific 
mechanisms linking Bristol Bay red king crab 
recruitment and the physical oceanography are 
unclear.  Zheng and Kruse (2000) hypothesized that 
the Aleutian Low strength affected food availability 
for red king crab larvae.  They stated that strong 
Aleutian Lows may have adverse effects on species 
composition of the spring bloom for red king crab 
larvae.  Diatoms, such as Thalassiosira, are 
important food for first-feeding red king crab larvae 
(Paul et al., 1989), and they predominate in the 
spring bloom in years of light winds when the water 
column is stable (Ziemann et al., 1991).  Years of 
strong wind mixing associated with intensified 
Aleutian Lows may depress red king crab larval 
survival and subsequent recruitment.  Yet, the 
recruitment trends of other crab stocks cannot be 
consistently explained by the decadal-scale 
variability of these environmental data.  It is possible 
that red king crabs in Norton Sound are too far north 
to be significantly affected by the Aleutian Low 
dynamics. 
 
Water temperature is an obvious climatic index that 
would affect development and survival of 
recruitment and growth of crabs.  Rosenkranz et al. 
(1998, 2001) reported on recruitment variations for 
Tanner crab stocks in the EBS as they relate to  
(1) warm bottom temperatures which favor Tanner 
crab gonadal development and egg incubation, and 
(2) warm sea surface temperatures.  Warm sea 
surface temperatures during spring promote increases 
in Pseudocalanus copepod nauplii, a primary prey of 
Tanner crab larvae, thus favoring feeding success of 
Tanner crab larvae due to higher prey densities.  
Statistically significant correlations exist between 
Tanner crab year classes and these temperatures 
(Rosenkranz et al., 1998, 2001).  
 
Zheng and Kruse (2006) noted that most of the six 
different crab stock recruitment time series in the 
same general vicinity of the EBS are not 
significantly correlated with each other.  As shown in 
Figure 117, the most closely related recruitment 
series are two blue king crab stocks.  Norton Sound 
red king crab recruitment was also negatively related 
to the recruitment of two blue king crab stocks, 
however, explanatory mechanisms for such 
relationships are unclear.  Thus the authors observed 
that “if large-scale physical forcing affects these 
stocks, they may not affect each stock the same way, 
as suggested by poor correlations among the stocks.”  
 
195
Since recruitment variations are also strongly related 
to spawning biomass, competition and predation, the 
authors have, in separate studies, examined all these 
other factors which would impact survival and 
recruitment of crabs. Zheng and Kruse (2003) found 
that spawning biomass explained only a small 
portion of recruitment variation for crab stocks in the 
EBS.  In another study, Zheng and Kruse (2006) 
found that some empirical evidence supports 
speculation that groundfish predation may play an 
important role in crab recruitment success in the 
EBS.  However, spatial dynamics in the geographic 
distributions of groundfish and crabs over time make 
it difficult to relate crab recruitment strength to 
groundfish biomass.  
 
In the end, the authors observe that “no single factor 
alone can consistently explain crab recruitment 
variation in the EBS, in part because most crab 
stocks in the same general vicinity, like the eastern 
Bering Sea, have divergent recruitment patterns.”  
This observation emphasizes the difficulty of 
predicting how ocean warming would impact crab 
survival and recruitment.

on the role of advection on crab recruitment 
Zheng and Kruse (2006) analyzed changes in spatial 
distributions of crab abundance in the EBS and how 
they might be related to the regime shifts during the 
last 30 years.  The excerpts below highlight the 
results of their analyses.  They found the spatial 
distribution of red king crab in the EBS had changed 
profoundly during the last three decades (Fig. 119).  
Female red king crabs were found primarily in 
central Bristol Bay during 1980–1987 and 1992– 
2004.  The distribution centers (centroids) of mature 
females moved south slightly during 1988–1991 but 
did not reach the southern locations previously 
occupied in the 1970s.  Small immature females 
occurred primarily along the shore and in 
northeastern Bristol Bay, and mature females 
occurred in the deeper water and offshore.  With 
ontogeny, young red king crab tend to move from 
inner Bristol Bay in a southwesterly direction along 
the north shore of the Alaska Peninsula to central or 
southern Bristol Bay as mature females. 
 
Centroids of Tanner crab in the EBS were highly 
variable during the past 30 years (Fig. 119), but only 
one pattern emerged.  From 1978 to 1983, most 
females and the centroids for mature females occurred 
primarily west of the Pribilof Islands.  From 1984 to 
1986, a low abundance period, female crabs were 
evenly distributed throughout their geographic range.  
From 1987 to 1991, female Tanner crabs were 
concentrated within Bristol Bay.  Few crabs were 
found in northeastern Bristol Bay from 1992 to 2004.  
Generally, small immature female Tanner crabs were 
located in waters deeper than for mature females.  The 
spatial distribution of female snow crabs also changed 
over time (Fig. 119).  It appears that the centroids of 
mature females have moved gradually to the 
northwest since the 1970s. 
 
Zheng and Kruse (2006) state that the shifts of 
distributions for large mature female red king crabs 
in Bristol Bay occurred right after the 1976/77 
regime shift, while the shifts of mature female snow 
crab occurred from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s.  
Loher (2001) hypothesized that changes in near- 
bottom temperatures associated with the 1976/77 
regime shift were causes for spatial shifts of red king 
crab female distributions, and Orensanz et al. (2004) 
proposed a similar hypothesis to explain spatial 
changes for snow crab.  Orensanz et al. (2004) 
further explained that the lagged northward shift of 
mature females, associated with warming during the 
5-year period 1975–1979, was indicative of a 
corresponding northward shift in larval settlement.  
Both studies attributed spatial shifts of crab

distributions to the cold pool in the early and mid- 
1970s and subsequent high near-bottom temperatures 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  During the late 
1970s and early 1980s, when near-bottom 
temperatures were very high, the centroids of mature 
female Tanner crab were primarily west of the 
Pribilof Islands (Fig. 119), and few female Tanner 
crabs were found in central Bristol Bay after the

199
Overall, after the regime shift in 1976/77, EBS crab 
stocks have been stronger in the northern than in the 
southern habitats.  For two red king crab stocks, the 
northern stock (Norton Sound) has recovered better 
from previous lows during the last 15 years than has 
the Bristol Bay stock.  Within the Bristol Bay stock, 
the southern component has almost disappeared, 
whereas the northern component is rebuilding.  For 
two blue king crab stocks, the mature abundance of 
the St. Matthew Island stock (northern stock) was 
relatively high until 1999 whereas the Pribilof 
Islands stock has been depressed since the early 
1980s (Vining and Zheng, 2004).  The abundance of 
mature female snow crab has been extremely low in 
their southern range during the last 10 years. 
 
Spatial distributions of mature and small juvenile 
female Tanner crab mostly overlap, with the 
distribution centers of juveniles generally being 
southwest of those of the mature females, whereas 
distribution centers of small juvenile red king and 
snow crabs are generally located downstream of the 
mature females.  For Tanner crab spawners near the 
shelf edge, their larvae may be retained and may 
settle near the adults or be carried away by currents 
to areas with poor habitats.  Thus, advection appears 
to be an important process for red king and snow 
crabs, whereas, in general, retention might be more 
favorable to the shelf-edge Tanner crab population.   
 
Northward shifts and different spatial distributions of 
mature and juvenile females may partly explain the 
recruitment variation for Bristol Bay red king crab 
and EBS snow crab.  The shifts of spatial 
distributions of mature females make it difficult to 
supply larvae to the southern ranges of their spatial 
distributions.  This not only reduces the number of 
suitable habitats to which larvae are delivered 
(Armstrong et al., 1993; Loher, 2001), but also slows 
juvenile growth due to relatively low temperatures in 
the north (Stevens, 1990), thus affecting recruitment 
strength. 
 
Unlike red king and snow crabs, EBS Tanner crab 
nursery areas occur offshore on soft bottom 
sediments.  For larvae released offshore, retention 
may be favorable, but for those released along the 
Alaska Peninsula, advection helps them to reach 
their nursery areas.  Rosenkranz et al. (1998, 2001) 
showed that Tanner crab recruitment may be 
enhanced by northeast winds during the larval 
period.  Winds blowing from the northeast along the 
Alaska Peninsula during spring (May and June) 
promote coastal upwelling (perhaps favoring 
productivity) while advecting larvae offshore to their 
nursery areas. 
 
Pandalid shrimp 
Shrimp (Pandulus and Pandalopsis  spp.) were a 
prominent, commercially harvested resource in the 
Being Sea in the early 1960s but they were rapidly 
depleted due to overfishing and other environmental 
changes (NMFS, 1999).  Environmental change must 
have affected this resource greatly, as shrimp 
biomass decreased significantly throughout Alaska, 
even when fishery exploitation levels were low.  The 
abundance declined so quickly that this resource was 
not commercially harvested for 20 or more years, 
except in specialized areas.  Thus, shrimp may be an 
indicator resource for the effects of ocean warming 
and associated climatic events.  
 
The northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) are the 
most important of the five species making up Alaska 
shrimp landings.  The domestic shrimp fishery in 
western Alaskan waters is currently at a low level.  
Shrimp abundance is also too low in the Bering Sea 
to support a commercial fishery.  The western GOA 
has been the main area of operation.  During the 
1970s, when the fishery was more productive, 50 to 
100 vessels trawled for shrimp at Kodiak Island and 
along the Alaska Peninsula. 
 
Shrimp landings in the western GOA (Fig. 120) show 
that catches rose steadily from 1965, peaked to about 
58,000 t in 1976 and then declined precipitously to 
2,000 t in 1984, and have remained at such low levels 
since; almost all of the landings came from 
southeastern Alaska.  Bering Sea shrimp catches by 
Russia and Japan peaked at 32,000 t in 1963, declined 
gradually until the fishery ended in 1973.  As with 
crabs, the potential yields of shrimp stocks in Alaska 
are not well understood, and have been equated to 
average catches.  Shrimp stocks are managed by 
regulating catch levels according to stock abundance.  
In addition, spring “egg hatch” closures are used to 
protect breeding stocks. 
 
Climatic influences  
The life history and ecology of shrimp seems to be 
particularly susceptible to ocean and climatic 
conditions.  Such influences are probably strong 
because climatic changes affect a broad phase of 
shrimp life history.  Pandalid shrimps occupy a 
200 
central position in the trophic structure of the 
northeastern Pacific, where they constitute the main 
prey of many fish species and, in turn, prey on the 
zooplankton community.  They also occupy all 
depths of the water column from the benthos to near 
surface.  Consequently, changes in their abundance 
and population dynamics directly reflect changes 
occurring within other trophic levels throughout the 
water column.  The proportions of shrimp in survey 
catches were found to be negatively correlated  
(r = –0.72) with water column temperature 
(Anderson, 2000).  Climate change, as manifested by 
changes in water column temperature, has an 
immediate effect on the lower trophic levels of 
boreal marine ecosystems, and rapid pandalid shrimp 
population changes are one of the first indicators that 
community structure is changing. 
 
Abundance of all pandalid shrimp, estimated from 
trawl surveys in the GOA, shows dramatic declines 
from 1973 to 1988, with some signs of recovery in 
the late 1990s (Fig. 121).  However, present 
abundance has still been substantially below those of 
the early 1970s.  Shallow water species, Pandalus 
goniurus and P. hypsinotus, are restricted to only a 
few sampled locations, but showed increases in 
overall abundance in 2001.  These species have, 
again, shown signs of declining abundance in 2003. 
Pandalus goniurus declined from 8 kg km
–1
 in 2001 
to 1 kg km
–1
 in 2003.  Pandalus hypsinotus has 
declined to less than 0.01 kg km
–1
 in the 2003 overall 
catch rate.  Species with a greater depth distribution, 
P. borealis and Pandalopsis dispar, are showing 
declines in abundance but not to the degree of the 
shallow water species. 
 
Analysis of length–frequency data from the various 
populations has provided clues to the mechanism 
responsible for the recent rapid population recovery.  
Strong size modes were evident in 2001 and 2002 
(Anderson, 1991).  Strong year classes of Pandalus 
borealis produced in 1999 and 2000 are directly 
responsible for the greater abundance of shrimp 
observed in the 2001 and 2002 surveys.  Weak 
recruitment of young age groups since 2002 has 
resulted in lower abundance observed for the 2003 
survey.  Results indicate that shrimp may be good 
indicators of the current state of the marine 
environment in the GOA. 
 
Recent changes in shrimp populations are directly 
linked to colder conditions, as indicated by PDO 
patterns.  Sustained strong recruitment of pandalid 
shrimp will require a continued shift to colder ocean 
conditions (Anderson, 2000).  Along with favourable 
oceanographic conditions to allow strong recruitment 
of shrimp, there will also need to be declines in 
predation pressure.  These principle factors play a 
central role in determining future pandalid 
population trends, and governing trends in other 
species abundance, as well.

Discussion 
The warming of the Earth’s atmosphere since the 
1970s is expected to change the global environment 
in the immediate future.  The Earth’s air temperature 
had essentially been fairly stable from 200 AD until 
the 1970s.  The average rise over the past 142 years 
has been only 1°C, but most of it has occurred since 
the 1970s.  The oceans are gradually warming as 
well.  While the change has been smaller (by 0.06°C 
on average; by 0.31°C for the top 300 m, and by 
0.06°C for depths to 3,000 m; Levitus et al., 2000), 
the effects of ocean warming are expected to be 
gradual and cumulative as the water mass of the 
oceans serve to hold heat for a long time.  For the 
northern latitudes towards and into the Arctic Ocean, 
changes in the ocean environment are of great 
concern.  Average temperatures in the Arctic region 
are rising twice as fast as they are elsewhere in the 
world. Arctic ice is getting thinner, melting and 
rupturing. If this trend continues, summers in the 
Arctic could become ice-free by the end of the 
century (ACIA, 2004).  
  
A warmer Arctic will affect weather patterns all over 
the world.  The ocean and atmosphere interact 
together in complex ways to produce what we know 
as climate.  As water and air temperatures rise and 
atmospheric forces change, winds and ocean currents 
will change.  There are predictions of the slowing of 
the major ocean currents in the Atlantic and the 
Pacific oceans as we know them now.  But, how 
these long-term changes will come about, and how 
they would be modified from shorter term climatic 
events, are less predictable.  In the case of the 
climatic forces off Alaska, this report has noted 
short-term dynamics of the ALPI and the 
intermediate-term change of the PDO index.  These 
are just two of the many physical atmospheric 
parameters one can measure.  Coupled to these 
atmospheric changes will be a complex set of inter-
related changes to the ocean–air coupling system.  
  
As ocean environments change in the North Pacific 
Ocean, ecological processes are expected to change, 
thus affecting all LMRs.  While some of the features 
of these changes can be determined, for the most 
part, they are still unpredictable.  This is particularly 
true when relating climate to ecosystem structure, 
since physical–biological coupling is non linear, and 
the biological response is an integration process of 
many physical signals from a number of time and 
202 
space scales and sources.  In addition, the impacts of 
higher temperatures on LMRs would get “integrated” 
into the impacts of other environmental changes and 
events that take place in the oceans simultaneously.  
The effects of climate change are expected to vary 
from species to species, and within different 
ecosystem settings.  While changes are likely to 
occur for all the species, the cases discussed in this 
report are only some examples of how little we know 
of impending events.   
 
Many hypotheses about oceanic food webs have been 
proposed to explain marine ecosystem regulation and 
population variations.  The common hypotheses 
invoke bottom-up (Beamish and Bouillon, 1993) and 
top-down controls (Springer et al., 2003; Worm and 
Myers, 2003) or combinations of both (Hunt et al., 
2002).  Changes in nutrients affecting the 
productivity of the lowest trophic levels (e.g., 
primary producers), which affect population 
abundance at the next higher trophic level (e.g., 
herbivores) and associated trends of populations at 
other trophic levels in an ecosystem, are considered 
bottom-up control.  Top-down control often 
functions through predation, initiated by animal 
predators, fishing or hunting, and may result in 
trophic cascades with opposite trends in population 
abundances between two trophic levels. 
 
Environmental factors like temperature, wind, 
barometric pressure, or overall environmental 
conditions may affect food availability and larvae 
transport, growth and survival (e.g., Koslow, 1984; 
Shepherd et al., 1984; Koslow et al., 1987; Hollowed 
and Wooster, 1992, 1995; Hare and Mantua, 2000), 
thus affecting recruitment strength of all LMRs. Of 
all the examples given in our review, no single factor 
or even a suite of factors can confidently be stated to 
be able to consistently explain variations in survival 
and abundance of the different resource components 
of the ecosystems.  This observation is evidently 
made from the Zheng and Kruse (2006) studies on 
eastern Bering Sea crabs, where six different crab 
stocks in the same general shelf vicinity exhibited 
different patterns of recruitment.  This observation 
emphasizes the difficulty of predicting how ocean 
warming would impact different components of the 
marine ecosystem.   
 
Only the broadest of observations can be made as to 
which ocean conditions seem to favor the different 
components of living marine resources in the marine 
ecosystem.  We have observed periods of high and 
low abundances of different species of seabirds, 
marine mammals, shrimps, crabs, groundfish, 
salmon, herring, and other species.  We can 
generalize that shrimp, king crab, Tanner crab, and 
Steller sea lions were significantly more abundant 
before the 1970s when groundfish resources began to 
flourish.  However, we cannot confidently relate how 
these abundances have changed with atmospheric 
and ocean conditions.  Fishing and environment both 
play a role in influencing survival of living marine 
resources, but quantifying and separating the effects 
are difficult. 
 
The ecosystem is a tightly linked biological and 
physical web.  It is not easy to dissect and understand 
the coupling of the web.  Our discussion merely has 
pointed out some major signals in the components of 
Alaska’s marine ecosystems and attempts to identify 
potential changes to these components as ocean 
conditions continue to warm.  The trend of research 
and management of the fisheries resources is towards 
an ecosystem perspective.  We merely focus on the 
principal signals of the dynamics of the principal 
component species.  Even with this simplified 
perspective, it is still difficult to understand and 
predict what would happen as the oceans around 
Alaska warm up and are affected by shorter term 
atmospheric forcing.  With the movement towards 
the evaluation of climatic change on the whole 
ecosystem, it is anticipated that adding a higher 
degree of complexity to the research can only help to 
explain what may be difficult to predict now.  A 
research program known as Loss of Sea Ice (LOSI) 
is being implemented by NOAA to research the 
issues.
