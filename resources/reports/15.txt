EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
This volume summarizes the results of workshops organized by the PICES-GLOBEC Climate Change 
and Carrying Capacity Program held just prior to the Eighth Annual Meeting in Vladivostok, Russia, in 
October 1999.  In addition, a very successful modelling workshop was subsequently convened in 
Nemuro, Japan, the following January.   
 
One of the most important goals is to integrate the results of national GLOBEC and related programs in 
order to review and promote a better understanding of how climate change affects the ecosystems of the 
North Pacific Ocean.  PICES plays a key role in this regard, because it serves as the forum where 
diverse scientists can come together, presenting their own recent findings, and learning about progress 
in other regions around the Pacific Rim.  With the rapid changes in climate occurring in the 1990s, 
PICES has played a crucial role in organizing meetings where scientists can meet to compare recent 
findings and exchange views on what seems to be happening in the North Pacific. 
 
The MONITOR Task Team first met in 1998 in Fairbanks.  Since that initial meeting a number of 
initiatives to improve monitoring of the North Pacific Ocean have been successfully implemented.  As 
this report indicates, large-scale plankton monitoring has begun with the deployment of a Hardy 
Continuous Plankton Recorder in the year 2000.  The Hardy recorder was developed in the 1920s and 
1930s, so it is hardly a modern electronic instrument.  However, it marks the first time that large scale 
plankton monitoring of the North Pacific has begun, and it is expected that the data so collected will 
provide badly needed information on the spatial scale of the plankton of the North Pacific–essential 
information if a more extensive monitoring program is to be put in place in future.  Most of the 
remainder of the MONITOR Task Team meeting was devoted to an extensive review and discussion of 
international efforts in GOOS (Global Ocean Observing System), which will serve as a framework for 
questions about how to get oceanographic data into a useable form in a timely manner.  The data from 
these new initiatives will form the basis for the monitoring systems of the future. 
 
The REX Task Team held a workshop to review the population dynamics of herring and euphausiids 
around the Pacific Rim.  Typical of small pelagic animals, large changes in the abundance of these key 
members of coastal ecosystems are observed over time, and interesting data on the changes in feeding 
success and overwinter energy depletion were reported.  An interesting development within the North 
Pacific are the reports on longer-term fluctuations in herring abundance, which will no doubt serve to 
provide a better perspective on the short-term fluctuations evident when only data from modern 
fisheries is examined.  A number of interesting relationships were also noted between the abundance of 
herring and euphausiids from around the Pacific Rim. 
 
Finally, the MODEL Task Team met to discuss developments during the past year and to make the 
final plans for an intensive workshop scheduled for Nemuro, Japan, in January 2000.  The extensive 
report from that meeting is included here, and describes the results of a substantial effort by many 
members of the PICES modelling community to develop a consensus on the essential elements of an 
ecosystem model for the North Pacific Ocean; their progress in doing so will provide an essential 
stepping stone towards a better understanding of what aspects of the ecosystem are most important to 
measure and monitor in the future. 
 
In conclusion, the many scientific threads within PICES are progressing well, and there is excellent 
reason to believe that in the near future, we will be able to weave these threads together and to produce

scientists or individual specialities.  As its name suggests, PICES’ “Four Seas” Program (Climate 
Change and Carrying Capacity) has an ambitious goal.  The hard work by the many individuals at the 
Task Team meetings (plus the dedication of the members of the PICES Secretariat to quietly ensure that 
that work is done as promised!) has led PICES very far in the first eight years of its existence.  I am 
very proud to be a part of this group, and am privileged to have had the opportunity to work with such 
a diverse group of talented and interesting people.  There are many challenges on the horizon for 
PICES.  I feel confident that the networks of people and ideas being nurtured within PICES will 
provide the nucleus for addressing them in the North Pacific– both those that we can foresee, and those 
that we have yet to discover.

Summary 
 
The NEMURO workshop made several 
significant achievements: 
 
1. Assembled an international team of marine 
biologists and physical oceanographers who 
collectively achieved a consensus on the 
structure and function of a PICES CCCC 
prototype lower trophic level ecosystem 
model for the North Pacific Ocean, and 
named it “NEMURO”; 
2. Developed e xecutable computer simulation 
models and preliminary outputs. Models 
developed included: 
 a) NEMURO/FORTRAN Box Model 
 b) NEMURO/1-D Yamanaka Model 
 c) NEMURO/1-D Kishi Model 
 d) NEMURO/MATLAB Box Model; 
3. Constructed physical f orcing data files and 
parameter sets for three locations in the 
North Pacific, station A7 on the A -line off 
southeast of Hokkaido (41.5ºN, 145.5°E), 
Ocean Station P (50°N, 145°W), and the 
Eastern Bering Sea (57.5°N, 175°W); 
 
4. Through an extensive dialog between 
modelers and plankton biologists, conducted 
a comprehensive review of NEMURO 
process equations and their parameter values 
for the three distinct geographic regions; 
5. Developed post-processing software to 
analyze model output in tabular and graphic 
formats; 
6. Carefully considered the benefit including a 
microbial food web l oop in NEMURO and 
designed a preliminary strategy for 
conducting comparative model experiments; 
7. Identified leaders and members of m odel 
experiment teams, a subgroup of the Model 
Task Team members and meeting 
participants, who will be active in conducting 
future model experiments; 
8. Initiated development of comparison protocols; 
9. Made recommendations for future lower 
trophic level modeling activities.  
 
The significance of these achievements will 
ultimately be evaluated by how well the CCCC 
Program effectively utilizes and embraces these 
models as a basis of future modeling activity.

1.0  Introduction 
 
The North Pacific Marine Science Organization 
(PICES) organizes and promotes an international 
science program on Climate Change and 
Carrying Capacity (CCCC) in the temperate and 
subarctic regions of the North Pacific Ocean.  
Ecosystem modeling is one of five key research 
activities defined by the CCCC Implementation 
Panel.  The PICES CCCC MODEL Task Team 
is given the role to encourage, facilitate and 
coordinate modeling activities within the member 
nations with respect to the goals and objectives of 
the PICES-CCCC Program.  At the 1996 
Nemuro Workshop on Modeling there was no 
support for efforts to standardize models or 
model approaches within the CCCC Program, 
believing that diversity in assumptions and 
techniques lead to faster advances in the North 
Pacific region.  However, at the Lower Trophic 
Level Model Workshop, held in Fairbanks, 
October 1998, the participants agreed that:  i) 
Models with different state variables and 
mathematical formulations would be impossible 
to compare, and ii) comparison protocols are 
necessary to tackle the problem.  Thus, the 
MODEL Task Team recommended to the CCCC 
Implementation Panel to convene a workshop on 
the development of a prototype model and 
comparison protocols.  The recommendation was 
approved by the CCCC-IP, Science Board, and 
finally by Governing Council. 
 
 
2.0  Goals and Objectives of the Workshop 
 
The goals of the workshop were to: 
 
1. Select a lower trophic level model of the 
marine ecosystem as a PICES prototype;  
 
2. Select a suite of model comparison protocols 
with which to examine differences and 
similarities in model dynamics; 
 
3. Demonstrate the applicability of the prototype 
model by comparing lower trophic ecosystem 
dynamics among different regional study sites 
in the CCCC Program; 
4. Compare the prototype model with other 
models; 
 
5. Identify information gaps and the necessary 
process studies and monitoring activities to 
fill the gaps;  
 
6. Discuss how to best link lower trophic level 
(LTL) marine ecosystem models to higher 
trophic level (HTL) marine ecosystem models, 
regional circulation models, and how to best 
incorporate these unified models into JGOFS 
models and the PICES CCCC Program. 
 
 
3.0  Organizing Committee, Sponsors, Venue and Participants 
 
Drs. Michio J. Kishi, Makoto B. Kashiwai, 
Bernard A. Megrey and Daniel M. Ware 
organized the meeting.  Dr. Bernard Megrey 
served as workshop chairman.  The Japan 
International Science and Technology Exchange 
Center (JISTEC), PICES, and the city of Nemuro 
provided financial support and access to excellent 
meeting rooms in the City Hall.  The Nemuro 
Support Committee supplied local logistical 
support.  
The venue was set at the Multi Purpose Hall, a 
large octagon shaped room, in the Nemuro City 
Cultural Center.  The hall had four personal 
computers forming a local network which 
included a server workstation, laser and color 
printers, and another one personal computer 
connected to the Internet.  These computers were 
allocated to four work areas for use by individual 
workgroups.  A classroom style table was 
arranged in the center of the room for the plenary

Twenty-nine scientists from China, Korea, 
Russia, Japan, Canada, and the United States 
(Fig. 1) met in Nemuro, Japan, between January 
30-February 4, 2000, to participate in a modeling 
workshop focused on developing a lower trophic 
level model of the marine ecosystem.  Out of the 
total, 15 scientists arrived with their own laptop 
computers, ready to get down to the business of 
building a numerical NPZ (nutrients, 
phytoplankton-zooplankton) model, estimate the 
models parameters, select a suite of model 
comparison protocols, compare the model to 
validation data sets, and to perform regional 
comparisons. 
 
Participants (Appendix 1) consisted of plankton 
scientists, modelers, and individuals with 
knowledge about key data sets about each 
selected region and lower trophic level modeling 
activity in that region.

5.0  Workshop Activity 
 
After an o pening ceremony and a w elcome 
party held the day before, the participants 
convened at the venue to start the four day 
workshop. 
 
1
st
 Session 
On the first day, the workshop officially opened 
with a welcome to all who had endured a long 
journey, cold weather, and a powerful snow 
storm to come to Nemuro.  
 
In the morning session, Dr. Megrey began by 
providing a general introduction to the activities 
of the PICES CCCC MODEL Task Team and 
some background information on decisions 
made at past Task Team meetings.  Since many 
in the audience had not been involved in the 
deliberations of the MODEL Task Team, the 
introduction was designed to give the 
participants a better sense of how we got to the 
Nemuro workshop. 
 
This was followed by a presentation by Dr. 
Makoto Kashiwai on model comparison 
protocols.  Starting from a brief review of 
reasons for comparison, Dr. Kashiwai 
discussed the requirements of the model.  In 
order for model results to be comparable, the 
basic underlying model should have the 
following items in common: 
 
• The currency of the model and its units of 
measurement 
• The time step 
• Spatial dimensions and size segmentation 
• Time series of driving factors 
• Functional ecological groups (i.e. state 
variables) 
• Mathematical description of biological 
processes and a definition of parameters 
and starting values 
 
A model imitating observed phenomena is 
nothing but a scientific toy.  A model can be a 
scientific tool only when it can output necessary 
comparison factors and indexes o f ecosystem 
structure and performance.  After pointing out 
these views, Dr. Kashiwai reviewed basic analyses 
resulting in graphic, diagrammatic, and/or index 
representation of the structure and performance of 
an ecosystem: 
 
• Methods to g raphically or schematically 
represent the s tructure and function of a n 
ecosystem model 
• Seasonal patterns of biomass for ecosystem 
components 
• Seasonal patterns of production for ecosystem 
components 
• Annual biomass balance and its seasonal pattern 
• Production and its allocation to primary 
production, or ‘ecological efficiency’ 
• Representation of the dynamic performance of 
an ecosystem model through sensitivity analysis  
• Methods of performing a sensitivity analysis 
• Carrying capacity dynamics described by P/B 
to B relationships 
• Dynamic response to ecosystem interactions by 
interaction coefficient matrices based on 
ecological niche theory. 
 
Dr. Francisco Werner presented logistical, 
practical, and theoretical issues related to linking 
lower trophic marine ecosystem models to higher 
trophic level models.  Based on the modeling and 
field activities presently underway in the Northwest 
Atlantic (Georges Bank) Program, Dr. Werner 
discussed various approaches to linking lower 
trophic models with higher trophic levels.  It was 
pointed out that the approaches in the NW Atlantic 
program have not included a detailed description of 
the population dynamics of the nutrient-
phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) system.  Rather, 
the approach has been one where climatological 
maps of existing decade-long observations of the 
lower trophic levels have been used as a baseline 
for setting quantitative levels of these components 
of the food web.  Coupled with realistic 3 -D 
circulation fields and individual-based models of 
zooplankton, successful studies establishing spatial 
and temporal links between the zooplanktonic 
populations in waters neighboring Georges Bank

zooplankton, successful studies establishing spatial 
and temporal links between the zooplanktonic 
populations in waters neighboring Georges Bank 
 5
and their (behaviorally modified) transport onto 
the Bank were described.  Similarly, u sing 
adjoint methods (for mathematical inversion), 
studies were discussed that enabled the 
inference of the spatial dependence of certain 
vital rates (e.g., mortality) that would otherwise 
be difficult to determine in the field.  In turn, 
these results have been coupled with individual-
based models of larval fish to determine the 
(vertically integrated, seasonal and monthly) 
optimum growth zones of cod and haddock 
early life stages on Georges Bank.  This has 
allowed the examination of fundamental 
ecological theories of match-mismatch versus 
member-vagrant in the regulation of marine 
populations.  Finally, with the recent 
completion of the 5 -year intensive field 
program, data of unprecedented detail in space, 
time and species will be coupled to circulation 
models to determine the links between the 
larval fish and the NPZ system on shorter time 
scales (weekly) and in full three-dimensional 
space.  
 
Dr. Megrey then had a discussion on what 
models, data sets, parameters, and validation 
data were brought to the meeting by 
participants.  The core parts of his presentation 
can be found in the Introduction, Goals, and 
Objectives sections of this report.  
 
The afternoon session focused primarily on a 
presentation by Dr. Michio J. Kishi and the 
current status of the prototype model as 
originally developed by Dr. Kishi.  The state 
variables, process equations representing 
system fluxes, parameter needs and outputs 
were discussed in detail.  A long discussion 
developed regarding whether the model 
correctly represented the marine ecosystem and 
could reproduce the dynamic features of lower 
trophic level production in the selected study 
areas.  Consequently, one more state variable 
representing predatory zooplankton and the 
connecting process equations were added to the 
proposed prototype.  After considerable 
discussion, the group of 29 scientists 
collectively agreed to accept this model as the 
PICES prototype lower trophic level marine 
ecosystem model (Fig. 2). 
 
This significant occasion was followed by a 
presentation by Dr. Dan Ware on the importance of 
including a microbial food web in the marine 
ecosystem lower trophic level model.  Details of his 
presentation are partly reproduced in the Microbial 
Food Web Team Report (below). 
 
The afternoon ended with a selection of model 
comparison locations.  Regions selected for 
comparison included station A7 on the A -line off 
the east side of Hokkaido (41.30°N, 145.30°E), 
Ocean Station P (50°N, 145°W), and the Eastern 
Bering Sea (57.5°N, 175°W) (Fig. 3).  
 
A summary of changes needed to complete the 
prototype model was discussed, the development of 
a flow diagram for data processing was presented 
(Fig. 4), and followed by a discussion of potential 
topics for breakout groups.  This list included 
 
• Biological review of the model parameters 
• Microbial food web formulation 
• Forcing file preparation and coding of new 
model segments 
• Post-processing and plotting programming

 Session 
The second day was taken up primarily with the 
teams beginning to deal with their specific tasks.  
The workshop s plit into four teams, each 
addressing a specific task (Appendix 2). 
 
The first team concerned itself with the preparation 
of the forcing files for the three geographic 
locations as well as coding of the test models.  The 
second team had the responsibility of reviewing the 
appropriateness of all biological process equations 
and reviewing the suitability of individual 
parameter values.  This team also generated a list 
of parameter values for each geographic location 
and supplied, where possible, a reference and a 
plausible possible range of values (Table 4).  The 
third team prepared the software for post-
processing the model output (reformatting of output 
data files and defining standardized figures for 
 5
and their (behaviorally modified) transport onto 
the Bank were described.  Similarly, u sing 
adjoint methods (for mathematical inversion), 
studies were discussed that enabled the

Five different but related models were examined 
at the workshop.  
 
• The PICES CCCC prototype lower trophic 
level marine ecosystem model named 
“NEMURO” (see below): a conceptual model 
representing the minimum trophic structure 
and biological relationships between and 
among all the marine ecosystem components 
thought to be essential in describing 
ecosystem dynamics in the North Pacific 
(Fig. 2). 
• The “NEMURO/FORTRAN Box” Model:  a 
FORTRAN computer program to solve the 
coupled set of differential equations making 
up NEMURO and the graphing software 
needed to examine model output. 
• The “ NEMURO/1-D Kishi” Model:  The 
NEMURO model coupled with a 1 -D ocean 
physics model.  The physical model runs 
prior to NEMURO, and provides the 
necessary physical forcing required by 
NEMURO. 
• The “ NEMURO/1-D Yamanaka” Model:  
Similar to the 1-D Kishi model except that the 
ocean physics model and NEMURO are 
calculated simultaneously in one FORTRAN 
computer program. 
• The “ NEMURO/MATLAB Box” Model: a 
MATLAB® version of NEMURO. 
 
In a friendly competition among meeting 
participants, the prototype model was named 
NEMURO ( North Pacific Ecosystem Model for 
Understanding Regional Oceanography).  The 
winning name was a joint effort with 
contributions coming from Drs. Vadim V. 
Navrotsky (Russia), Bernard A. Megrey 
(U.S.A.), and Lan S. Smith (Japan).

consists of the conceptual model, a set of coupled 
differential equations and process equations, and 
a table of parameter values and initial starting 
conditions.  NEMURO, which is made up of 11 
state variables each represented by a box 
compartment, is shown schematically in Figure 2.

6.1 NEMURO Prototype Model 
 
The NEMURO NPZ marine ecosystem model 
consists of the conceptual model, a set of coupled 
differential equations and process equations, and 
a table of parameter values and initial starting 
conditions.  NEMURO, which is made up of 11 
state variables each represented by a box 
compartment, is shown schematically in Figure 2.  
The state variables (and state variable names) are 
Nitrate (NO3), Ammonium (NH4), Small 
Phytoplankton Biomass (PhyS), Large 
Phytoplankton Biomass (PhyL), S mall 
Zooplankton Biomass (ZooS), Large Zooplankton 
Biomass (ZooL), Predatory Zooplankton Biomass 
(ZooP), Particulate Organic Nitrogen (PON), 
 10
Dissolved Organic Nitrogen (DON), Particulate 
Organic Silicate (Opal), and Silicate 
Concentration (Si(OH)4).  Fluxes between and 
among the state variables (represented in Fig 2 
with arrows) represent the fluxes between the 
model compartments in both nitrogen (black 
arrows) and silicon (blue arrows) units.  The unit 
of currency for the model is expressed in units of 
nitrogen. 
 
The formulation of the fluxes between the model 
compartments is given by a set of 14 coupled 
ordinary differential equations (Table 2).  
 
Although parameter tuning is an important task 
for the future work, NEMURO is useful for use in 
regional comparisons of the eastern and western 
North Pacific by comparing results to changing 
the values of parameters.  It is important to 
realize that regional comparisons cannot be made 
if the model is different with respect to: 
 
• the physical model in which the ecological 
model is embedded,  
• the number of ecological compartments,  
• the equations representing each physiological 
process, and  
• the parameter values.  
 
During the drafting of this report, the conveners 
found that there were differences in the definition 
of important parameters used in traditional stand-
alone lower trophic and higher trophic and/or 
population dynamics models.  One is the relation-
ship between assimilation coefficient (a), growth 
efficiency ( b), egestion, and excretion.  The 
traditional stand-alone lower trophic level 
models, including NEMURO use the following 
formulations: 
 
 Excretion: ExcZ = (a – b) * GraPZ, 
 Egestion:   EgeZ = (1.0 – a)* GraPZ 
 
where GraPZ is the grazing rate of zooplankton 
on phytoplankton.  While the usual ecology 
textbook definitions of the above equations are: 
 
 Excretion: ExcZ = (a (1.0 – b)) * GraPZ, 
 Egestion:   EgeZ = (1.0 – a)* GraPZ. 
 
Another is the mortality coefficient (MorZ) which 
is related to biomass or the square of biomass:  
 
 MorZ = Mor*exp(K*Temp)*Z
2
 
  (traditional stand-alone LTL model), or 
 MorZ = Mor*exp(K*Temp)*Z, 
 
where, Mor is the m ortality rate, K is the 
temperature coefficient, and Z is the biomass of 
zooplankton. 
 
Without predation by carnivores, the model needs 
mortality related to biomass squared to avoid 
burst increases of zooplankton biomass and to 
stabilize the model dynamics.  However, this is a 
mathematical trick that has nothing to do with 
biological theory.  This may cause the linking of 
the lower trophic level model to h igher trophic 
level models.  This subject should be considered 
at the next workshop when discussing the linkage 
between lower trophic level ecosystem models 
and higher trophic level ecosystem models.  
 
6.2 NEMURO/FORTRAN Box Model 
 
This model is a FORTRAN computer program 
built t o solve the coupled set of differential 
equations making up NEMURO and the graphing 
software needed to examine model output. 
 
The process equations, which describe individual 
submodel processes (i.e. photosynthesis, 
grazing), are be presented in Table 2, parameter 
values for the three geographic areas are given in 
Table 1 and further details of the 
NEMURO/FORTRAN Box Model can be found 
in Appendix 3.3. 
 
In Figure 5 the time-dependent features of each 
compartment solved by the NEMURO/ 
FORTRAN Box M odel are s hown.  Panel A 
shows model dynamics for station A7 and Panel 
B shows dynamics for Station P (see Table 1 for 
simulation parameters).  These results, however, 
are only preliminary because the parameters used 
are based on experiments, and are not yet tuned.  
Tuning of the parameters should be continued.

Dissolved Organic Nitrogen (DON), Particulate 
Organic Silicate (Opal), and Silicate 
Concentration (Si(OH)4).  Fluxes between and 
among the state variables (represented in Fig 2 
with arrows) represent the fluxes between the 
model compartments in both nitrogen (black 
arrows) and silicon (blue arrows) units.  The unit 
of currency for the model is expressed in units of 
nitrogen. 
 
The formulation of the fluxes between the model 
compartments is given by a set of 14 coupled 
ordinary differential equations (Table 2).  
 
Although parameter tuning is an important task 
for the future work, NEMURO is useful for use in 
regional comparisons of the eastern and western 
North Pacific by comparing results to changing 
the values of parameters.  It is important to 
realize that regional comparisons cannot be made 
if the model is different with respect to: 
 
• the physical model in which the ecological 
model is embedded,  
• the number of ecological compartments,  
• the equations representing each physiological 
process, and  
• the parameter values.  
 
During the drafting of this report, the conveners 
found that there were differences in the definition 
of important parameters used in traditional stand-
alone lower trophic and higher trophic and/or 
population dynamics models.  One is the relation-
ship between assimilation coefficient (a), growth 
efficiency ( b), egestion, and excretion.  The 
traditional stand-alone lower trophic level 
models, including NEMURO use the following 
formulations: 
 
 Excretion: ExcZ = (a – b) * GraPZ, 
 Egestion:   EgeZ = (1.0 – a)* GraPZ 
 
where GraPZ is the grazing rate of zooplankton 
on phytoplankton.  While the usual ecology 
textbook definitions of the above equations are: 
 
 Excretion: ExcZ = (a (1.0 – b)) * GraPZ, 
 Egestion:   EgeZ = (1.0 – a)* GraPZ. 
 
Another is the mortality coefficient (MorZ) which 
is related to biomass or the square of biomass:  
 
 MorZ = Mor*exp(K*Temp)*Z
2
 
  (traditional stand-alone LTL model), or 
 MorZ = Mor*exp(K*Temp)*Z, 
 
where, Mor is the m ortality rate, K is the 
temperature coefficient, and Z is the biomass of 
zooplankton. 
 
Without predation by carnivores, the model needs 
mortality related to biomass squared to avoid 
burst increases of zooplankton biomass and to 
stabilize the model dynamics.  However, this is a 
mathematical trick that has nothing to do with 
biological theory.  This may cause the linking of 
the lower trophic level model to h igher trophic 
level models.  This subject should be considered

between lower trophic level ecosystem models 
and higher trophic level ecosystem models.

6.3 NEMURO/1-D Kishi Model 
 
The NEMURO/1-D Kishi Model is the NEMURO 
model coupled with a 1-D ocean physics model.  
The physical model runs prior to NEMURO, and 
provides the necessary physical forcing required 
by NEMURO. 
 
Instructions for downloading the 1-D Kishi Model 
are given in Appendix 4, and further details about 
the model can be found in Appendix 3.2. 
 
6.4. NEMURO/1-D Yamanaka Model 
 
The NEMURO/1-D Yamanaka Model is similar 
to the 1 -D Kishi model except that the ocean 
physics model and NEMURO are calculated 
simultaneously in one FORTRAN computer 
program.  Biological process equations used are 
given in Table 2, parameter values for the three 
regions are described in Table 1, and further 
details about the model can be found in Appendix 
3. 
 
In the physical model, the water column is split 
into 50 layers with 20 layers above 100 m.  The 
mixed layer process is the Mellor-Yamada level 
2.  Outputs from the physical model are tempera-
ture, salinity, diffusion coefficient for t racers, 
diffusion coefficient for momentum and turbulent 
energy through time and by depth. 
 
Biological and physical results of applying the  
1-D Yamanaka model to the three regions, 
presented as time-depth plots, are given for 
station A7 (Fig. 6), station P (Fig. 7), and the 
eastern Bering Sea station (Fig. 8).  Note that the 
vertical axis is described by log scale and 0 of 
horizontal axis starts on September 1
st
. 
 
It can be seen that large zooplankton immigrate 
into the domain of the model (i.e., shallow 
euphotic zone) from the zone deeper than 300 m.  
After large zooplankton increases, ZooLn 
(biomass of large zooplankton described by 
nitrogen) increases dramatically from large 
zooplankton grazing on large phytoplankton and 
small zooplankton.  Large phytoplankton and 
small zooplankton decrease when large 
zooplankton abundance is high.  Predatory 
zooplankton increases from grazing large 
zooplankton when large zooplankton densities are 
adequate for feding.  The fluctuation of large 
phytoplankton follows one month after that of 
small phytoplankton.  As to the biomass of 
plankton, the largest one is small phytoplankton, 
followed by predatory zooplankton and small 
zooplankton.  This box model was run under the 
constant temperature and light without annual 
oscillation. 
 
6.5. NEMURO/MATLAB 
 
NEMURO/MATLAB is a MATLAB® version of 
NEMURO.  The MATLAB scripts making up 
NEMURO/MATLAB are a convenient modeling 
framework in that MATLAB includes numerical 
integration routines as well as integrated plotting 
functions.  The MATLAB scripts can be found in 
Appendix 5 and 6, the differential and process

NEMURO/MATLAB is a MATLAB® version of 
NEMURO.  The MATLAB scripts making up 
NEMURO/MATLAB are a convenient modeling 
framework in that MATLAB includes numerical 
integration routines as well as integrated plotting 
functions.  The MATLAB scripts can be found in 
Appendix 5 and 6, the differential and process 
 12
equations are described in Table 3, parameter 
values for the base run are found in Table 4, and 
instructions for running the scripts are in 
Appendix 7. 
 
It is important to note that the parameters and 
units in the NEMURO/MATLAB model are in 
different units compared to the NEMURO/ 
FORTAN Box model.  For example, 
concentrations are in units of millimoles/m
3
, 
lengths are in meters, time values (i.e. rates) are 
in units of days.  Concentrations in the 
NEMURO/FORTRAN Box model are in 
moles/m
3
.  Therefore, close attention must be 
paid to the decimal place when converting 
constants, rates or comparing parameter values in 
Tables 1 and 4. 
 
In preparing NEMURO/MATLAB changes were 
made to NEMURO, which required adding an 
additional 4 state variables.  Thus NEMURO is an 
11 state variable model and NEMURO/MATLAB 
is a 15 state variable model.  The change was 
done primarily to conserve mass in NEMURO 
and does not alter system dynamics.  Changes 
relative to 11 state variable NEMURO/ 
FORTRAN Box model are listed below. 
 
• Large phytoplankton may be grazed by small 
zooplankton.  Therefore terms needed to be 
added to the PhyLn and ZooSn equations. See 
Process Equation 10-2 in Table 3. 
• In the NEMURO/MATLAB simulations, 
natural mortality terms are first order, not 
second order.  These change the mortality 
parameters in equations PhySn, PhyLn, 
ZooSn, ZooLn, ZooPn and the related detritus 
(PON) term.  Second order terms are retained 
in the model, but are commented out.  See 
Process Equations 4, 5 in Table 3 for 
formulations. 
• State variables related to silicon dynamics are 
simplified.  Most of the 11-state variable 
model silicon equations either have rates 
equal to zero (as they should) or are simply 
the nitrogen dynamics with all terms 
multiplied by the Silicon:Nitrogen (Si:N) 
ratio.  These three redundant equations are 
eliminated to make the model run faster.  The 
silicon uptake equation uses the nitrate 
growth parameters multiplied by the large 
phytoplankton Si:N ratio.  This is the same as 
in the NEMURO/FORTRAN Box model 
formulation, but uses fewer parameters, 
again, to speed things up for running on a 
PC. 
• Four new state variables are added for the 
calculation of total Nitrogen (i.e., to conserve 
mass):  DeepNO3, DeepPON, DeepSi, and 
DeepOpal.  These are the nitrogen and silicon 
pools located below the model domain.  They 
are the source of the upwelled nitrate/silicon 
and the recipient for the sinking detritus. 
They don’t affect the dynamics, but are 
needed to conserve mass. 
• Light limitation is parameterized differently. 
Instead of assuming some optimum light 
intensity and calculating light at the model 
depth, in the NEMURO/MATLAB model, 
light limitation is incorporated by a simple 
seasonally varying efficiency.  In the model it 
ranged between 0.2 and 0.8.  A diurnal 
component was also be added.  See Process 
Equation 1 in Table 3. 
• The NEMURO/MATLAB model was run 
with and without remineralization of 
particulate silicon (opal).  The runs presented 
have no surface remineralization, i.e. 
DecSi=0. 
 
Preliminary results, presented in Figures 9 and 
10, are from a “base” model run using the 
Station P parameters given in Table 4 .  This 
parameter set produced a fairly stable model with 
all populations persisting throughout the twenty-
year model run (Fig. 9 ).  Phytoplankton and 
zooplankton populations exhibited small seasonal 
variations, but no very large variations.  There 
was a brief spring bloom of large phytoplankton, 
which was quickly grazed down by large 
zooplankton.  This model is fairly similar to what 
might be expected at Station P in the North 
Pacific.  However, the large phytoplankton 
(diatom) bloom, is generally not observed.  
However, given that this is a box model with no 
vertical migration of zooplankton and no iron 
 12
equations are described in Table 3, parameter 
values for the base run are found in Table 4, and 
instructions for running the scripts are in 
Appendix 7. 
 
It is important to note that the parameters and 
units in the NEMURO/MATLAB model are in 
different units compared to the NEMURO/ 
FORTAN Box model.  For example, 
concentrations are in units of millimoles/m
3
,

NEMURO/FORTRAN Box model are in

However, given that this is a box model with no 
vertical migration of zooplankton and no iron 
 13
limitation, it was felt that this “base case” would 
serve to examine the behavior of the 
NEMURO/MATLAB model.  Details of the 
“base case” run for years 4 through 6 are shown 
in Figure 10 for the plankton and nitrogen and 
silicon fields respectively.

7.0  Model Comparison Measures 
 
The participants discussed the possible outputs 
from the model.  For adequate model 
comparison, the minimum requirements from the 
model are as follows: 
• Time trace of state variables 
• P/B ratio 
• Proportion of production by trophic 
functional groups 
• Ecotrophic coefficient (%Primary Production 
available to ZL & ZP) 
• Total biomass (ZS+ZL+ZP) production 
• Si/NO3 integrated over the whole water 
column 
• Si production/N production integrated over 
the whole water column 
• Evaluation of conservation of mass 
 
However, during the workshop, there was not 
enough time to change the model code to add the 
above variables.  Thus only the time-dependent 
features of each compartment were discussed.

Discussions were held over three days to review 
the suitability of the biological process equations 
formulations, determine the appropriate 
parameter values for three distinct physical 
locations, provide references and parameter 
ranges where possible, and to examine different 
formulations for several of the biological 
equations.  The general form of the equations was 
endorsed, but there were a few minor changes.  
The most important was the suggestion to replace 
the Steele (1962) formulation of the 
photosynthesis light curve

8.2 Microbial Food Web Team Report 
 
The PICES NEMURO simulation model partitions 
the plankton into five state variables: small 
phytoplankton, large phytoplankton, small 
zooplankton, large zooplankton, and predatory 
zooplankton.  The task of the working group was 
to describe what functional groups of organisms 
were represented by these five components, to 
develop a simple parameterization of the 
microbial food web for inclusion in the model, 
and to suggest possible additions that could be 
included in future generations of the model. 
 
Why is the Microbial Food-web Important? 
 
The classical food web concept that many of us 
were taught assumed that the primary production 
in marine ecosystems was grazed primarily by 
herbivorous mesozooplankton, which in turn 
supported a food-web of higher trophic level 
predators.  However, studies over the last decade 
have revealed the importance of the microbial 
food-web in aquatic ecosytems, and have shown 
that it can have a significant impact on the 
amount of primary production that is actually 
available to the mesozooplankton, and hence to 
higher trophic levels (Moloney and Field, 1991).  
For example, in low nutrient ecosystems, or 
during periods of low nutrient availability, a 
relatively high percentage of the gross primary 
production ends up as dissolved organic matter 
that is utilized by bacteria.  The bacteria in turn 
are grazed by heterotrophic nanoflagellates, 
which in turn are eaten by ciliates and other 
microzooplankton.  Since the microzooplankton 
are an important food source for the 
mesozooplankton, this group of organisms links 
the microbial food web to the classical food-web. 
Cushing (1989) noted that the classical food-web 
transfers most energy during the spring and 
autumn blooms in temperate waters (under 
weakly stratified conditions), but that the 
microbial food-web dominates the strongly 
stratified (oligotrophic) waters of the temperate 
summer.  Permanently well-mixed coastal zones 
in the temperate seas presumably could be 
dominated by either the classical food web or the 
microbial food web, depending on the trophic 
status of the area. 
 
It has been estimated that 10 to 50% of the 
primary production passes through the 
bacterioplankton (McManus and Peterson 1988), 
and that very little of the resulting bacterial 
production is available to the mesozooplankton.  
For example, in the NE subactic Pacific Ocean, 
Rivkin et al. (1999) estimate that only about 3% 
to 12% of the bacterial carbon production is 
transferred to copepods.  Consequently, in this 
ecosystem a large proportion of the primary 
production is respired by the microbial food web 
in the surface layer, rather than being exported to 
higher trophic level predators, or the deep-sea. 
 
Structure of the Plankton Community 
 
It is imperative that the model user has a clear 
understanding of the components of the plankton 
which are represented by each state variable, and 
the “hidden” interactions that can occur between 
the components within some state variables.  
Figure 12 indicates that the small phytoplankton 
(PS) group implicitly contains the autotrophic 
picoplankton (0.2-2 microns equivalent spherical 
diameter (ESD) in size), and autotrophic 
nanoflagellates (2-20 microns ESD).  The large 
phytoplankton group (PL) contains the 
netphytoplankton (20-200 microns ESD), which 
are primarily diatoms.  The small zooplankton 
(ZS) group contains the heterotrophic flagellates 
(2-20 microns ESD), and the microzooplankton 
(20-200 microns ESD).  The large zooplankton 
(ZL) group consists of copepods and euphausiids, 
which are primarily (but not exclusively) 
herbivores.  The predatory zooplankton, like 
amphipods and chaetognaths, are represented by 
the state variable, ZP.  The predatory 
zooplankton and large herbivorous zooplankton 
form the interface between the lower trophic 
levels and the higher trophic levels, which will be 
added to future generations of the model.

sensitivity analyses performed on them.  In 
particular, all the parameters related to processes 
required to describe the dynamics of the ZP state 
variable were unknown.

It is imperative that the model user has a clear 
understanding of the components of the plankton 
which are represented by each state variable, and 
the “hidden” interactions that can occur between 
the components within some state variables.  
Figure 12 indicates that the small phytoplankton 
(PS) group implicitly contains the autotrophic 
picoplankton (0.2-2 microns equivalent spherical 
diameter (ESD) in size), and autotrophic 
nanoflagellates (2-20 microns ESD).  The large 
phytoplankton group (PL) contains the 
netphytoplankton (20-200 microns ESD), which 
are primarily diatoms.  The small zooplankton 
(ZS) group contains the heterotrophic flagellates 
(2-20 microns ESD), and the microzooplankton 
(20-200 microns ESD).  The large zooplankton 
(ZL) group consists of copepods and euphausiids, 
which are primarily (but not exclusively) 
herbivores.  The predatory zooplankton, like 
amphipods and chaetognaths, are represented by 
the state variable, ZP.  The predatory 
zooplankton and large herbivorous zooplankton 
form the interface between the lower trophic 
levels and the higher trophic levels, which will be 
added to future generations of the model. 
 
 20
Trophic Interactions 
 
Figure 12 indicates that picophytoplankton are 
primarily eaten by heterotrophic flagellates, while 
the microzooplankton are assumed to graze 
primarily on nanophytoplankton.  An important 
“hidden” feeding interaction occurs within the ZS 
compartment, since microzooplankton will also 
consume heterotrophic flagellates.  Similarly, 
within the ZL compartment euphausiids will 
consume copepods, under some circumstances.  
 
Note that the functional importance of bacteria is 
captured implicitly in NEMURO in the 
decomposition process, which is assumed to 
occur “instantaneously”.  Bacteria do not appear 
explicitly in the model, because very little 
bacterial production passes through the microbial 
loop to the large herbivorous and predatory 
zooplankton, which form the link to the higher 
trophic levels.

Representing the Microbial Food Web 
 
In natural communities, diatoms and 
dinoflagellates are able to take rapid advantage of 
nitrate availability, whereas the smaller 
phytoplankton are more adapted to survive in 
nutrient poor, oligotrophic environments.  
Diatoms and dinoflagellates tend to be the main 
contributors to new production, while 
cyanobacteria, prochlorophytes and small 
autotrophic flagellates are believed to be most 
likely involved in systems dominated by 
regenerated production. In oligotrophic regions of 
the oceans and in some coastal upwelling regions, 
picophytoplankton can contribute up to 80% of 
the total autotrophic biomass and primary 
production. 
 
In response to changes in nitrate availability, 
temperature and grazing pressure, there is an 
implicit shift in the size structure of the microbes 
within the small phytoplankton and small 
zooplankton compartments in the model, which 
has important energetic implications.  For 
example, when nanoplankton dominate the small 
phytoplankton (PS) component it requires one

the oceans and in some coastal upwelling regions, 
picophytoplankton can contribute up to 80% of 
the total autotrophic biomass and primary 
production. 
 
In response to changes in nitrate availability, 
temperature and grazing pressure, there is an 
implicit shift in the size structure of the microbes 
within the small phytoplankton and small 
zooplankton compartments in the model, which 
has important energetic implications.  For 
example, when nanoplankton dominate the small 
phytoplankton (PS) component it requires one 
 21
trophic step to convert nanoplankton production 
into microzooplankton production, with a growth 
efficiency of 0.3 (Fig. 12).  At the other extreme, 
when picoplankton dominate the PS, then two 
trophic steps are required to convert picoplankton 
production into microzooplankton production, 
with an efficiency of 0.3
2
 (or 0.09).  The 
resulting growth efficiency is much lower in this 
case because picophytoplankton are primarily 
consumed by heterotrophic flagellates, which in 
turn, are eaten by microzooplankton.  
Accordingly, the length of the microbial food 
chain will vary dynamically between a value of 1 
and a maximum of 2, in response to changes in 
physical forcing, nutrient availability, and grazing 
mortality.  The working group discussed how 
these  “hidden” changes in the length of t he 
microbial food chain and, their impact on the 
growth efficiency of the ZS could be 
parameterized with a minimal increase in model 
complexity.  
 
Field studies have shown that the large 
phytoplankton are dominant when there is an 
abundant supply of silicate and nitrate (a high f-
ratio).  Conversely, the smaller phytoplankton 
become dominant when the concentrations of 
nitrite and silicate are depleted, and the 
ammonium concentration increases.  
Accordingly, when the proportion of small 
phytoplankton (i.e. PS/[PS+PL]) changes in the 
model, we assume that a similar change occurs in 
the relative proportion of picoplankton in the PS 
compartment (i.e. pico/[pico + nano]).  The 
resulting change this causes in the length of the 
microbial food chain (m = fractional number of 
trophic steps between PS and ZS), and in the PZ 
growth efficiency (âZS) can be represented by:

where, a = maximum ratio of picoplankton/total 
phytoplankton biomass in the study area. 
Observed values of a vary between 0.2 to 0.8; 
lower values are typical in coastal ecosystems and 
larger values in oceanic systems.  The  simple 
formulation summarized in equation 4 causes the 
growth efficiency to vary between 0.11 when 
picophytoplankton dominate the PS biomass, and 
0.3 when nanophytoplankton dominate.  In 
NEMURO, changes in the growth efficiency 
affect the excretion rate, and hence the 
productivity of the small zooplankton.  
 
Future Steps 
 
The sensitivity of the model output to “the band-
aid solution” proposed in equation 4 needs to be 
fully tested.  If the productivity of the large 
zooplankton is particularly sensitive to equation 
4, then a better formulation of the ZS growth 
efficiency equation should be developed and 
tested.  Clearly, it is important that the model 
estimate the production of large zooplankton, as 
accurately as possible because this functional 
group of organisms often forms the primary link 
to higher trophic levels, which will eventually be 
added to the model.  In ecosystems where 
autotrophic picoplankton are particularly 
important, the microbial food web could be 
simulated better by creating separate 
picoplankton, nanophytoplankton, heterotrophic 
flagellates and microzooplankton groups.  
However, this increase in realism comes at an 
expense, since it would increase the model 
complexity by two state variables and several 
process equations. 
 
In the current formulation of the model the team 
noted that the production of large zooplankton 
will be somewhat overestimated because 
euphausiids can also eat copepods (Fig. 12).  
Hence the ZL growth efficiency will be 
somewhat less than the fixed value of 0.3 
assumed in the model.  If this interaction is 
considered to be important, the ZL growth 
efficiency should also be transformed into a 
variable. 
 
8.3 Post Processing & Plotting Software Team 
 
The post-processing team’s efforts focused on 
taking the output of Yamanaka’s preliminary 1-D 
 21
trophic step to convert nanoplankton production 
into microzooplankton production, with a growth 
efficiency of 0.3 (Fig. 12).  At the other extreme, 
when picoplankton dominate the PS, then two 
trophic steps are required to convert picoplankton 
production into microzooplankton production, 
with an efficiency of 0.3
2
 (or 0.09).  The 
resulting growth efficiency is much lower in this 
case because picophytoplankton are primarily 
consumed by heterotrophic flagellates, which in 
turn, are eaten by microzooplankton.  
Accordingly, the length of the microbial food 
chain will vary dynamically between a value of 1 
and a maximum of 2, in response to changes in 
physical forcing, nutrient availability, and grazing 
mortality.  The working group discussed how 
these  “hidden” changes in the length of t he 
microbial food chain and, their impact on the 
growth efficiency of the ZS could be 
parameterized with a minimal increase in model 
complexity.  
 
Field studies have shown that the large 
phytoplankton are dominant when there is an 
abundant supply of silicate and nitrate (a high f-
ratio).  Conversely, the smaller phytoplankton 
become dominant when the concentrations of 
nitrite and silicate are depleted, and the 
ammonium concentration increases.  
Accordingly, when the proportion of small 
phytoplankton (i.e. PS/[PS+PL]) changes in the 
model, we assume that a similar change occurs in 
the relative proportion of picoplankton in the PS 
compartment (i.e. pico/[pico + nano]).  The 
resulting change this causes in the length of the 
microbial food chain (m = fractional number of 
trophic steps between PS and ZS), and in the PZ 
growth efficiency (âZS) can be represented by:

8.3 Post Processing & Plotting Software Team 
 
The post-processing team’s efforts focused on 
taking the output of Yamanaka’s preliminary 1-D 
 22
coupled physics and foodweb model and post-
processing it for display by M ATLAB.  Four 
cases were processed: 
1. Station P Climatological Conditions 
2. Bering Sea Climatological Conditions 
3. Station A7 Climatological Conditions 
4. Station A7 for 1990  
and presented at the workshop.  It should be 
stressed that all these cases are preliminary and 
should be considered only representative of the 
type of analyses and inter-comparisons that could 
be possible once the Yamanaka model is fully 
tested.

9.0  Model Experiments and Model Comparisons 
 
Several model comparison experiments were 
designed during the workshop.  For those 
planned experiments, three factors were varied: 
which model was used, which geographical 
location and corresponding set of biological 
parameters were used, and which physical forcing 
scenario was used.  The details of the 
experiments and their objectives are described 
below. 
 
Experiment 1 
 
Objective:  To compare the NEMURO/ 
FORTRAN Box model with simpler physical 
forcing (biology but minimal physics) to the fully 
forced NEMURO/1-D Yamanaka NPZ bio-
physical model.  Both models used the same 
biological state variables, parameters and process 
equations. 
 
Configuration:  The NEMURO/FORTRAN Box 
Model configured to station A7 was compared to 
the NEMURO/1-D Yamanaka model configured 
to station A7.  The NEMURO/FORTRAN Box 
model was forced with sea surface temperature 
and solar radiation, while the NEMURO/1-D 
Yamanaka model was forced with daily average 
values from station A7.

averages and monthly averages. 
 
Experiment 3 
 
Objective:  To compare the same bio-physical 
marine ecosystem model to two widely separated 
locations in the North Pacific using separate 
biological data and physical forcing data.  This 
run provided an west (A7)-east (Station P) North 
Pacific comparison in model dynamics.

run with the Ocean Station P biological and 
climatological physical forcing data (monthly 
averages).

biological data and physical forcing data.  This 
run provided model dynamics for a western 
Pacific open ocean station (A7) to an enclosed sea 
North Pacific station (Bering Sea).

10.0  Recommendations 
 
Results of the MODEL TASK TEAM work 
accomplished at the workshop results in several 
recommendations: 
 
• Perform a sensitivity/stability analysis on 
NEMURO, and proceed to compare the 
structure and performance, and dynamic 
characteristics of the model.  
 
• Test the sensitivity of production of small 
and large zooplankton, P/B ratio, and eco-
logical efficiency to inclusion of the “Band-
Aid” microbial food web. If model output is 
sensitive then implement a more complete 
description of the microbial food web. 
 
• Develop a way to measure when a change 
in model output is “significant”. The metric 
should consider time, space, and some 
absolute values of parameters. 
 
• Future work should be coordinated by the 
MODEL Task Team Co-Chairmen and 
encouraged to present results at next annual 
meeting of PICES. Cooperation and 
coordination with other CCCC Task Teams 
is very important. 
 
• Issues related to model management need to 
be addressed so as to better control the 
increasing number of different versions of a 
model, including process equations, para-
meter files, physical forcing data files, and 
post-processing programs.  We propose to 
examine the ICES/GLOBEC experience to 
obtain guidance as to how best to proceed.

/Bering Sea 
3-3. Parameter Sets/Sta. A/Sta. P/Bering Sea 
 
4. Reviewed b iological parameters and process 
equations 
 
5. Developed tools for post analysis viewing of 
model output 
 
6. Considered the m icrobial food web model 
and developed an implementation plan 
 
7. Identified model experiment teams 
Compared to the goals and objectives of the 
workshop, the following activities must be 
undertaken: 
• Link with high trophic level model  
The model needs to include fishes, 
marine mammal, m arine birds, and also 
micro-nekton. 
• Perform basic model validation studies  
Develop model validation protocols. 
Compare physical factors with direct 
observations. 
Compare model biomass predictions with 
direct observations. 
• Identify scientific questions for 
comparison 
Communication and cooperation with the 
REX and BASS Task Teams is needed 
• Perform listed experiments. 
It is important to identify a leader for 
each experiment and to encourage team 
activities.  Dr. Kishi will contact 
participants of the Nemuro workshop by 
e-mail and will give a concrete task to 
each participant. The results of each team 
should be presented at the MODEL 
workshop at PICES IX in Hakodate.

contributed the major part of financial support for 
this workshop.  We note this valuable support, 
for without it, the workshop would have been 
very small.  Nemuro was selected as the venue 
due in large part to the invitation from Nemuro 
Supporting Committee.  The conveners, on behalf 
of all who attended the workshop, express their 
very deep appreciation for the warm welcome 
and perfect support arranged and given by 
Nemuro Supporting Committee, their staff, and 
the people of Nemuro city.

Upwelling process is not incorporated.  
7. Structure of Biological Model 
NEMURO Prototype Model 
Photosynthesis light curve: after Platt et al (1980) 
Excretion:(á – â) 
Zooplankton Mortality: relate to biomass squared 
8. Input data 
 Climatic forcing: monthly mean wind stress, solar radiation, SST, SSS from Levitus data sets, 
COADs 
 Daily forcing:  
9. Parameter set 
 Calibrated for: 
 Validated for: 
10. Output data 
Physical Model: temperature, salinity, and vertical eddy diffusivity through time and by depth. 
Biological model: NO3, NH4, PON, DON, SiO, PSn, PLn, ZSn, ZLn, ZPn; PLs, ZLs, ZPs

Appendix 7  Implementation and User’s Guide for the NEMURO/MATLAB Model. 
 
 
A description of the implementation of the NEMURO/MATLAB model is provided below.  The 
governing equations are described in Table 3 and model parameters are those corresponding to the 
“Station P base case” run as in Table 4.  Two MATLAB programs are needed to run this case: 
 
Nemuro_base.m: this is the MATLAB code containing the model equations detailed in Table 3.  The 
full listing of the MATLAB code is provided in Appendix 6.  The model parameters for the base case 
are included (hardwired) into the code. 
 
Nemuro_base_commands.m: these are the commands to be issued to run the model and to generate the 
plots.  The full listing of the MATLAB is provided in Appendix 5. 
 
These files can also be downloaded from the PICES website http://www.pices.ios.ca/model/. 
 
To run the model, the files should reside in a common directory.  Within a MATLAB window, the 
simplest way to reproduce figures 5 and 6 of the report is to type “Nemuro_base_commands” after the 
MATLAB prompt.  The execution of all the commands (initaliaztion, equation set-up, equation solution 
and plotting) will likely take several minutes on a PC with a Pentium III processor.  The base case 
model is set up for a 20 year run with 2-hour time steps.  The standard Runge-Kutta solver “ode45” is 
used in solving the system of equations.  To get more information on the properties of the solver, type 
“help ode45” from within a MATLAB window. 
 
As written, changes in initial conditions should be made in Nemuro_base_commands.m while changes 
in the form of the governing equations, or in the internal parameters should be made in the 
Nemuro_base.m file.

The Task Team met in Vladivostok October 8-10, 
1999.  The first day was devoted to a workshop 
on the relationship between planning of a 
monitoring system for the subarctic N. Pacific 
within PICES and the international planning 
activity taking place within the Global Ocean 
Observing System (GOOS) community.  The 
report is divided into two sections:  the first 
section presents abstracts of papers delivered in 
the workshop, and the second section summarizes 
subsequent discussion of issues raised in the 
workshop and other matters.  The second section 
includes recommendations.

The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), 
sponsored by IOC, WMO, UNEP, and ICSU, is 
a scientifically-based, long-term international 
program that seeks to provide practical benefits to 
society through the collection and timely 
distribution of oceanic data and products, 
including assessments, assimilation of data into 
numerical prediction models, the development 
and transfer of technology, and capacity building. 
“Operational oceanography” is a term that has 
been used in international GOOS discussions. 
 
GOOS recently held its first International 
Agreement Meeting in which there was strong 
international support for at least some of the 
GOOS modules, which presently include Climate, 
Health of the Oceans (HOTO), Living Marine 
Resources, Coastal, and Services modules.  In the 
North Atlantic, ICES has recently formed a 
steering group on GOOS that has developed a set 
of recommendations with regard to their 
involvement in GOOS activities.  PICES nations 
in the western Pacific are involved in one of the 
most advanced regional components of GOOS, 
North-East Asian Regional GOOS.  Presently, 
PICES scientific committees and the CCCC 
Program are involved in activities that are related 
to GOOS. We need to begin discussions of how 
we should move towards advancing a North 
Pacific GOOS program that meets the needs of 
PICES member countries.  This one-day 
discussion, held during the PICES CCCC

The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), 
sponsored by IOC, WMO, UNEP, and ICSU, is 
a scientifically-based, long-term international 
program that seeks to provide practical benefits to 
society through the collection and timely 
distribution of oceanic data and products, 
including assessments, assimilation of data into 
numerical prediction models, the development 
and transfer of technology, and capacity building. 
“Operational oceanography” is a term that has 
been used in international GOOS discussions. 
 
GOOS recently held its first International 
Agreement Meeting in which there was strong 
international support for at least some of the 
GOOS modules, which presently include Climate, 
Health of the Oceans (HOTO), Living Marine 
Resources, Coastal, and Services modules.  In the 
North Atlantic, ICES has recently formed a 
steering group on GOOS that has developed a set 
of recommendations with regard to their 
involvement in GOOS activities.  PICES nations 
in the western Pacific are involved in one of the 
most advanced regional components of GOOS, 
North-East Asian Regional GOOS.  Presently, 
PICES scientific committees and the CCCC 
Program are involved in activities that are related 
to GOOS. We need to begin discussions of how 
we should move towards advancing a North 
Pacific GOOS program that meets the needs of 
PICES member countries.  This one-day 
discussion, held during the PICES CCCC 
MONITOR Task Team Workshop provided a 
forum for PICES scientists to learn about GOOS 
and to develop recommendations for PICES 
future involvement.

It was certainly appropriate to have held this 
workshop as part of the PICES GLOBEC CCCC 
MONITOR Task Team effort.  GLOBEC 
recognizes that some of the monitoring efforts 
initiated under the GLOBEC umbrella will be 
considered candidates for long-term monitoring 
under GOOS.  At the regional level, PICES 
nations are beginning GOOS strategic planning 
and activities related to the NEAR-GOOS effort, 
so it is important for us to learn from those 
efforts but also for us to bring our ecosystem 
perspective to these programs.  There is a great 
deal of activity and planning going on in the 
international front and PICES needs to see where 
these efforts are going.  Some of these efforts 
such as HOTO require that we bring in the 
expertise and perspectives of our MEQ 
Committee to discuss their relevance and 
importance to PICES.  The data sharing aspects 
of GOOS may provide practical b enefits to 
PICES nations as they seek to understand and 
predict the state of the ocean – a task that 
requires the sampling efforts and data of more 
than one nation. 
 
 
International Global Ocean Observing System Program

The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) is a 
sustained coordinated international system for 
gathering ocean data.  GOOS is also a system for 
processing the data to enable the generation of 
beneficial products and services as well as the 
research and development on which such services 
and products depend for their improvement.  
Information arising from this long-term, 
multidisciplinary monitoring will be used to 
assess present and future states of the oceans in 
support of their sustainable use, contribute to the 
prediction of climate change and variability and 
meet the needs of a wide range of users.  GOOS 
will differ from most present observing systems 
in the following ways:  (1) modeling and 
forecasting is a part of its mandate as well as data 
collection;  (2) the approach is holistic, integrated 
and interdisciplinary rather than narrow or 
sectoral;  and (3) it is designed to deliver useful 
products for both decision-makers and the 
scientific community. 
 
Planning for GOOS is conducted through four 
modules:  Climate; Living Marine Resources; 
Coastal and Health of the Oceans.  For each 
module, a strategic design panel has been 
established to define the requirements of the 
system in its area.  In addition to the 
observational requirements, the panels also 
specify the products required by users and the 
capacity building and data management 
infrastructure necessary to support the module.  
The climate and HOTO modules are most 
advanced with regard to specifying system 
requirements. 
 
The GOOS Initial Observing System (IOS) is 
already bringing together relevant international 
programs under the aegis of GOOS.  These 
ongoing programs are consistent with GOOS 
design principles.  Examples are the TAO array 
of buoys, the Coral Reef Monitoring Network 
and the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey of 
the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean 
Science.  In addition, countries are encouraged to 
identify national programs which could be 
considered relevant contributions to GOOS. 
 
Several pilot projects are also being planned to 
take forward aspects of the GOOS design, 
including the Global Ocean Data Assimilation 
Experiment (GODAE) the Array for Real-Time 
Geostrophic Oceanography (ARGO) and the Pilot 
Research Array in the Tropical Atlantic

efforts but also for us to bring our ecosystem 
perspective to these programs.  There is a great 
deal of activity and planning going on in the 
international front and PICES needs to see where 
these efforts are going.  Some of these efforts 
such as HOTO require that we bring in the 
expertise and perspectives of our MEQ 
Committee to discuss their relevance and 
importance to PICES.  The data sharing aspects 
of GOOS may provide practical b enefits to 
PICES nations as they seek to understand and 
predict the state of the ocean – a task that 
requires the sampling efforts and data of more 
than one nation. 
 
 
International Global Ocean Observing System Program

The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) is a 
sustained coordinated international system for 
gathering ocean data.  GOOS is also a system for 
processing the data to enable the generation of 
beneficial products and services as well as the 
research and development on which such services 
and products depend for their improvement.  
Information arising from this long-term, 
multidisciplinary monitoring will be used to 
assess present and future states of the oceans in 
support of their sustainable use, contribute to the 
prediction of climate change and variability and 
meet the needs of a wide range of users.  GOOS 
will differ from most present observing systems 
in the following ways:  (1) modeling and 
forecasting is a part of its mandate as well as data 
collection;  (2) the approach is holistic, integrated 
and interdisciplinary rather than narrow or 
sectoral;  and (3) it is designed to deliver useful 
products for both decision-makers and the 
scientific community. 
 
Planning for GOOS is conducted through four 
modules:  Climate; Living Marine Resources; 
Coastal and Health of the Oceans.  For each 
module, a strategic design panel has been 
established to define the requirements of the 
system in its area.  In addition to the 
observational requirements, the panels also 
specify the products required by users and the 
capacity building and data management 
infrastructure necessary to support the module.  
The climate and HOTO modules are most 
advanced with regard to specifying system 
requirements. 
 
The GOOS Initial Observing System (IOS) is 
already bringing together relevant international 
programs under the aegis of GOOS.  These 
ongoing programs are consistent with GOOS 
design principles.  Examples are the TAO array 
of buoys, the Coral Reef Monitoring Network 
and the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey of 
the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean 
Science.  In addition, countries are encouraged to 
identify national programs which could be 
considered relevant contributions to GOOS. 
 
Several pilot projects are also being planned to 
take forward aspects of the GOOS design, 
including the Global Ocean Data Assimilation 
Experiment (GODAE) the Array for Real-Time 
Geostrophic Oceanography (ARGO) and the Pilot 
Research Array in the Tropical Atlantic 
 
81 
(PIRATA).  The main GOOS pilot project, 
GODAE, is designed to demonstrate the power of 
integrating satellite and in situ data using model 
data assimilation and the value of a global system 
capable of working in real time.  GODAE is 
needed for open-ocean analyses and forecasts and 
to establish boundary forcing for regional models 
to improve forecasting in coastal systems. 
 
Although the GOOS system is intended to exist 
indefinitely, the planning phase will be completed 
by 2010.  The strategic design plans should be 
completed by 2001, during which time a data and 
information management system also will be 
developed.  From 2000 to 2010 GOOS will be 
implemented progressively, including the addition 
of more national and international observing 
systems and the establishment of additional pilot 
projects. 
 
There is ample opportunity for closer cooperation 
between PICES and GOOS.  It is suggested that 
PICES can contribute to GOOS in the following 
ways:  (1) identify existing relevant ocean 
observations in the subarctic Pacific which could 
contribute to GOOS;  (2) develop an integrated 
PICES-GOOS plan based on existing routine 
observations and augmented with new 
observations as required;  and (3) develop a plan 
to identify and implement transition of relevant 
North Pacific research activities to routine 
observations and ultimately data products. 
 
 
LMR Module of GOOS

The LMR Panel met in March of 1998 (Paris) 
and March 1999 (Montpelier), and is scheduled 
to meet in Talcahuano, Chile, in December 1999.  
Initially, the Panel focused on offshore 
ecosystems, but after the second meeting, coastal 
fisheries were also assigned to the LMR module 
(previously they were to be considered by the 
coastal Panel).  Present GOOS plans call for the 
LMR module to be combined with coastal GOOS 
and other modules some time in 2000. 
 
Work of the LMR-GOOS Panel is not so 
advanced as that of other panels because of the 
relative difficulty of determining which 
parameters most effectively define the state of a 
marine ecosystem and which of them can be 
routinely monitored in a cost-effective way.  
Monitoring the physical state of the ocean is 
much easier to conceptualize, development of the 
technology of the measurements is far advanced, 
and there are already operational systems in 
place.  In the case of living marine resources, on 
the other hand, there are few present observing 
systems on which to build, many of the desired 
variables are difficult to measure in a routine 
fashion, and there are few agreed linkages 
between measured physical and biological 
variables and desired products such as forecasts 
of abundance and availability of living marine 
resources.  The latter will depend on improved 
ecosystem understanding which should result 
from the work of GLOBEC and other relevant 
research. 
 
Relevant measurements for LMR range from 
physics and nutrients up through the various 
trophic levels to fish, sea birds and marine 
mammals.  A generic table of categories of 
desired measurements has been developed and is 
being elaborated to a more specific list in selected 
regions, for example the Chilean coast.  The 
observing system to determine such parameters 
must, to the extent possible, depend on remote 
sensing and on ships of opportunity, since 
dedicated observing systems will be difficult to 
fund on a continuing basis.

NEAR-GOOS is a regional project of GOOS in 
the western Pacific region that was initiated in 
1996.  The present participating countries are the 
People’s Republic of China, Japan, the Republic 
of Korea and the Russian Federation.  The aims 
are to demonstrate the usefulness of a regional 
observing system in GOOS, to promote free 
exchange of oceanographic data in real time over 
the Internet to be used to create daily maps of sea 
conditions in the marginal seas of the 
northwestern Pacific and to distribute ocean data 
to a wide range of marine scientists.  At present, 
the marine environmental data included in the 
system are physical data such as temperature, 
salinity, and ocean currents and waves.  In the 
future, biological and chemical variables will be 
added to the system.  Other high priorities are the 
expansion of the number of contributors and 
users, development of a uniform data format and 
improvement of data quality submitted to NEAR-
GOOS.  NEAR-GOOS collaborates with other 
relevant programs such as NEAR-HOTO and 
NOWPAP, and organizations such as PICES.

ICES has established a Steering Group on the 
Global Ocean Observing System (SGGOOS).  
The task of the SGGOOS is to prepare an action 
plan for how ICES should take an active and 
leading role in further developments and 
implementation of GOOS at a North Atlantic 
regional level with special emphasis on 
operational fisheries oceanography.  In order to 
help formulate the action plan, a workshop was 
held in March 1999, in Bergen, Norway.  The 
terms of reference for the workshop were as 
follows:  (1) identify existing ocean observing 
activities within ICES that are relevant to GOOS;  
(2) investigate how observations already being 
made routinely could be combined and enhanced 
and incorporated within a common plan:  (3) 
propose a possible design for an ICES regional 
GOOS component;  and (4) develop a draft

The Real-Time Data Base (RTDM) and Delayed-
Mode Data Base (DMDB) in Japan are operating 
successfully.  T hese extensive systems were 
developed at the Japan Oceanographic Data 
Center (JODC) prior to GOOS and have a long 
history of use in Japan.  The Japan 
Meteorological Agency (JMA) produced a 
Japanese version of the NEAR-GOOS brochure, 
which will help to promote the development of 
NEAR-GOOS.  A five-year research program is 
now being implemented by Japanese universities.  
As part of this study, real-time monitoring of the 
volume transport and path of the Kuroshio will be 
carried out, and chemical and biological data in 
the northwest Pacific will be collected by  ships 
and satellites.  The basic goal of this study is to 
improve understanding of ocean processes 
through forecasting of temperature, salinity, 
currents, chemical substances and biological 
productivity in marginal seas of the western 
Pacific.  It is expected that many of these 
measurements will become long-term components 
of GOOS.

The Russian national GLOBEC plan is not finally 
designed and approved.  However, GLOBEC-like 
ecosystem studies of various agencies are 
included in the list of priority science and 
development programs adopted by the Ministry of 
Science and Technologies for the post-perestroika 
period.  One of the major programs among them 
is the Ecosystem Dynamics project that has been 
implemented mostly by the institutes of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences.  Other agencies 
such as the Hydrometeorological Committee, the 
Committee on Fisheries, the Naval Hydrographic 
Service and the Ministry of Education 
(universities) carry on ecosystem studies in 
accordance with their ministry programs.  
Because of a lack of funding, the number o f 
monitoring programs were considerably reduced 
over the last few years, particularly within the 
last two agencies. 
 
The Hydrometeorological Committee is officially 
responsible for the monitoring and assessment of 
environment quality including the marine 
environment.  It maintains a net of meteorological 
stations and observations along standard 
hydrographic sections located in the Okhotsk and 
Japan seas.  Data archival and methodological 
support is provided by the Far Eastern Regional 
Hydrometeorological Research Institute

(FERHRI) (contact: Dr. Yuriy Volkov, Director - 
 
84 
hydromet@online.ru).  The Hydrometeorological 
system provides data on physical forcing related 
to the oceanic and atmospheric conditions.  
Observations of temperature, salinity, hydro-
chemistry at standard levels from the surface 
down to 1000-1500 m and marine meteorology 
were obtained along repeated fixed sections since 
the late 50s;  however, by the end of the 90s, a 
number of operational coastal stations were 
eliminated and the hydrographic sections program 
was terminated because of funding cutbacks. 
 
Ecosystem studies by the Committee on Fisheries 
are focused mostly on higher trophic level 
organisms and physical forcing.  The main 
organizations dealing with monitoring programs 
in the North Pacific are the Pacific Research 
Fisheries Center (TINRO-Center), Sakhalin 
Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography 
(SakhNIRO) and Kamchatka Research Institute of 
Fisheries and Oceanography (KamchatNIRO).  In 
the 80s, the TINRO-Center (contact: Dr. Lev 
Bocharov, Director - root@tinro.marine.su) 
started regular assessment of demersal/pelagic 
fishes and invertebrates, zooplankton and 
ichthyoplankton distribution as well as hydro-
graphic and hydrochemical conditions in the 
Bering, Okhotsk and Japan seas and Kuril Isl. 
area.  Some cruises also sample nekton, primary 
production, bacteria and protozoa.  CTD 
measurements are typically done down to 500 m, 
trawl and acoustic sampling is used to obtain fish 
distribution data at a typical 30 mi spacing.  The 
surveys cover quite large areas and are repeated 
annually at particular seasons: March-May - 
northwestern shelf of the Okhotsk Sea (pollock 
survey); May-July - western Kamchatka shelf 
(crab survey); July-September - western Bering 
Sea (pollock survey); and July-October - Okhotsk 
Sea (salmon survey).  Hydrographic observations 
are also made along two fixed sections through 
the Japan Sea (0-200 m) and along a section 
across the Kamchatka Strait (0-1500 m). 
 
Observations and sampling by SakhNIRO 
(contact: Dr. Felix Rukhlov, Director - 
okhotsk@tinro.sakhalin.ru) are very similar to 
those made by TINRO.  Monitoring is principally 
in a region within 100 mi of Sakhalin Is. in the 
Okhotsk Sea and Tatar Strait.  Hydrography and 
plankton are observed twice per year along 
standard sections down to 500-1500 m depth.  An 
annual survey of fishery resources includes 
juvenile distribution of pollock, herring and cod.  
Monitoring of salmon is also implemented at 
fishery plants. 
 
At least three institutes of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences are engaged in ecosystem monitoring: 
the Pacific Oceanological Institute (POI), the 
Institute of Marine Biology (IMB) and the 
Institute of Automation and Control Processes 
(IACP).  POI (contact:  Prof. Victor Akulichev, 
Director - poi@eastnet.febras.ru) conducts 
studies of physical forcing and lower trophic 
levels at various areas of the North Pacific.  
Long-term monitoring of the water mass and 
current structure of the western boundary of 
subarctic gyre (Kuril-Kamchatka area) began in 
1990 as t he INPOC project, and was then 
followed by joint surveys with TINRO (1994) and 
SakhNIRO (1996).  The results indicate indicate 
circulation changes in the area over the 90s which 
should produce a notable response of higher 
trophic level organisms.  It is expected the survey 
will be continued on an annual basis.  Another 
area of planned monitoring is the Peter the Great 
Bay and the adjacent northwestern part of the 
Japan Sea.  Circulation and water exchange in the 
coastal area, mesoscale eddies and their input to 
fluxes and ecosystem dynamics are the main 
topics of the POI studies that are to be conducted 
as a part of the CREAMS-II program. 
 
The Institute of Marine Biology (contact: Dr. 
Vladimir Kasiyanov, Director - inmarbio@-
mail.primorye.ru) monitors both the lower and 
the higher trophic levels of the Peter the Great 
Bay ecosystem.  The area of the study is bounded 
by the Tuman river mouth (Tumangan project) 
and Amursky Bay. 
 
Inter-Institute Center for Satellite Monitoring of 
the Environment (contact: Dr. Emil Herbeck 
herbeck@iapu2.marine.su) has been recently 
established by IACP, POI and TINRO.  This 
center will maintain monitoring of the Japan and 
Okhotsk seas based on NOAA AVHRR and

hydromet@online.ru).  The Hydrometeorological 
system provides data on physical forcing related 
to the oceanic and atmospheric conditions.

in a region within 100 mi of Sakhalin Is. in the 
Okhotsk Sea and Tatar Strait.  Hydrography and 
plankton are observed twice per year along 
standard sections down to 500-1500 m depth.  An 
annual survey of fishery resources includes 
juvenile distribution of pollock, herring and cod.  
Monitoring of salmon is also implemented at 
fishery plants. 
 
At least three institutes of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences are engaged in ecosystem monitoring: 
the Pacific Oceanological Institute (POI), the 
Institute of Marine Biology (IMB) and the 
Institute of Automation and Control Processes 
(IACP).  POI (contact:  Prof. Victor Akulichev, 
Director - poi@eastnet.febras.ru) conducts 
studies of physical forcing and lower trophic 
levels at various areas of the North Pacific.  
Long-term monitoring of the water mass and 
current structure of the western boundary of 
subarctic gyre (Kuril-Kamchatka area) began in 
1990 as t he INPOC project, and was then 
followed by joint surveys with TINRO (1994) and 
SakhNIRO (1996).  The results indicate indicate 
circulation changes in the area over the 90s which 
should produce a notable response of higher 
trophic level organisms.  It is expected the survey 
will be continued on an annual basis.  Another 
area of planned monitoring is the Peter the Great 
Bay and the adjacent northwestern part of the 
Japan Sea.  Circulation and water exchange in the 
coastal area, mesoscale eddies and their input to 
fluxes and ecosystem dynamics are the main 
topics of the POI studies that are to be conducted 
as a part of the CREAMS-II program. 
 
The Institute of Marine Biology (contact: Dr. 
Vladimir Kasiyanov, Director - inmarbio@-
mail.primorye.ru) monitors both the lower and 
the higher trophic levels of the Peter the Great 
Bay ecosystem.  The area of the study is bounded 
by the Tuman river mouth (Tumangan project) 
and Amursky Bay. 
 
Inter-Institute Center for Satellite Monitoring of 
the Environment (contact: Dr. Emil Herbeck 
herbeck@iapu2.marine.su) has been recently 
established by IACP, POI and TINRO.  This 
center will maintain monitoring of the Japan and 
Okhotsk seas based on NOAA AVHRR and 
 
85 
SeaWiFS thermal and ocean color imagery 
measurements. 
 
In relation to Russian plans for ecosystem 
monitoring, the following issues should also be 
discussed:  feasibility of implementation, methods 
of observations and data quality control, and data 
accessibility.  In many cases, even when the 
project is approved, its implementation depends 
on funding availability.  Even if the allocated 
funds do not allow full implementation, partial 
implementation is often possible.  Special 
attention should be given to the methods of 
measurement, sampling design, analysis and data 
quality control.  This is especially critical in the 
construction of long time series.  Data availability 
for the international oceanographic community 
may also be a serious issue.  Information on some 
physical and hydrochemical parameters in some 
areas of marginal seas may be restricted for 
international exchange. 
 
Besides national plans, Russia is already involved 
in international projects related to monitoring of 
the North Pacific such as NEAR-GOOS and 
NOWPAP (contact: water@unep.org).  The 
NEAR-GOOS project is the North-East Asian 
Regional component of the Global Ocean 
Observing System (GOOS) initiated by the IOC 
Sub-Commission for Western Pacific 
(WESTPAC). Participating countries are China, 
Japan, Korea and Russia.  The area of interest 
covers Japan, and the East-China and Yellow 
seas.  The scope of the project is to facilitate the 
exchange of marine environmental data through a 
system of real-time and delayed-mode data base 
that should provide free internet access for any 
user.  The environmental parameters included in 
the system are so far focused on physical data in 
order to ensure the successful initiation of the 
operation.  With the operation of the system well 
underway and given the requirements of the user 
community, it is necessary to extend the variables 
included in the system to include chemical and 
biological data.  At present the Russian 
contribution to the NEAR-GOOS data exchange 
system includes marine meteorological data 
which are being contributed to the Real Time 
Data Base by FERHRI.  POI has made available 
previously classified data from 13,628 
oceanographic stations for international data 
exchange under the IODE/GODAR project.  
These data may now be contributed to the NEAR-
GOOS Delayed Mode Data Base.  For further 
development of the NEAR-GOOS program i n 
Russia, it is required (a) to determine the 
regulations for international data exchange for the 
NEAR-GOOS program at the national level;  (b) 
to provide necessary funds for NEAR-GOOS 
activities;  and (c) to improve the 
telecommunication system in the country.  The 
last one is extremely important in order to 
involve more users and contributors to the 
NEAR-GOOS data base (NEAR-GOOS contact: 
http://www.unesco.org/ioc/goos/neargoos.htm). 
 
An additional international project which has 
similar objectives as NEAR-GOOS covers a 
similar geographic area and involves the same 
countries, but covers a much wider range of 
marine, coastal and associated fresh water 
environments, is the Action Plan for Protection, 
Management and Development of the Marine and 
Coastal Environment of the Northwest Pacific 
Region (Northwest Pacific Action Plan - 
NOWPAP).  It was established in 1994 under the 
United Nations Environment Program as one of 
the components of its Regional Seas Program.  
NOWPAP includes a sub-project focused on the 
establishment of a collaborative, regional 
monitoring program that is developing jointly 
with IOC/WESTPAC.  The last Inter-
governmental Meeting on NOWPAP suggested 
the establishment of a regional monitoring center 
to co-ordinate activity of participating countries 
(contact - water@unep.org). 
 
In summary, Russia still has plans for large-scale 
ecosystem monitoring of the Northwest Pacific 
and marginal seas.  Its execution depends on the 
economic situation in the country and availability 
of national funds.  Russia can offer resources for 
cooperation with the international marine science 
community, which includes experienced research 
groups, individual scientists and a large research 
fleet.

The primary focus of the USA GOOS Climate 
Module Committee has been the execution of 
program ARGO (Array for Real-time 
Geostrophic Oceanography).  This program was 
originally proposed by a group of USA scientists 
and is now in the process of being developed as 
an international program under the GOOS 
banner.  The plan is to deploy globally a large 
number of Palace floats to measure profiles of 
temperature and salinity in the upper 2000 m of 
the ocean.  In addition, measurements of velocity 
are obtained at the level where the floats drift 
before they periodically ascend to the surface to 
broadcast profile data to a satellite receiver.  The 
resulting data set will be used to estimate the 
geostrophic component of the velocity field. 
 
The Committee is presently working on the 
following aspects of the program:  (1) develop 
algorithms to calculate salinity from the 
temperature, conductivity and pressure data;  (2) 
consider development of an improved system for 
preparing and telemetering the profile for 
ultimate assimilation into numerical models;  and 
(3) the transports in the narrow western boundary 
currents will not be measured by the floats and a 
supplemental system needs to be designed. 
 
The present plan is to obtain 3×3 degree 
coverage in space with a 10 day time step.  Initial 
deployments would begin in the SE Pacific.  On 
this schedule the Subarctic Pacific would be 
seeded in 2-3 years.  Commitments to the global 
program are currently 80-85% of what will be 
needed.

GOOS Climate Module 
Canada has discussed in some detail potential 
contributions to the GOOS/GCOS climate 
module, but recommendations at this point are 
not matched with funding resources.  Highest 
priority has been given to the following projects:  
(1) five geocentrically positioned tide gauges (two 
on the east coast, including one new gauge on the 
Labrador coast, two on the west coast  and a new 
gauge in the Arctic);  (2) continuation of the 
research-based time series on Line P and at the 
site of the OWS P in the Pacific, at the site of 
OWS Bravo, and on an annual section across the 
Labrador Sea;  and (3) a substantial (possibly 5% 
of the global array) contribution of profiling 
floats to the ARGO program.  Canada would 
consider providing floats in regions outside areas 
adjacent to the Canadian coast, should the 
contributions of other nations provide regional 
coverage in areas of particular Canadian interest.  
Slightly lower priority has been given to carrying 
out one transocean section off both the east and 
west coasts every eight years for the assessment 
of the inventories and transports of heat, salt and 
carbon.  
 
Enhancements to GOOS Climate and Coastal 
Modules 
This contribution involves augmentation of the 
physical ocean observing system.  (1) Seasonal 
sampling of the water properties on Canada’s 
continental shelves and marginal seas (including 
the Arctic), using hydrographic sections and time 
series stations (roughly 12 sections and 8 time 
series stations on the east coast, 9 sections and a 
moored climate station on the west coast and an 
annual hydrographic survey in the Beaufort Sea 
region of the Arctic Ocean).  (2) Enhancement of 
the tide gauge network, some of which would be 
geocentrically positioned (roughly 6 gauges on 
the east coast, 4 gauges on the west coast and 1 in 
the Arctic).  These gauges would be in addition 
to those designated for the climate module.  (3) 
Direct measurement of the volume transport on 
the Labrador shelf and through the Canadian 
archipelago.  (4) Observations of sea-ice 
concentration, extent and velocity both off the 
coast of Labrador, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence 
and in the Canadian Arctic.  The extent to which 
these measurements will contribute to the GOOS 
observing system depends on the final design of 
the climate module monitoring system. 
 
Living Marine Resources (LMR) and Health of 
the Ocean (HOTO) Modules 
Potential Canadian contributions to the HOTO 
and LMR modules are less clear than for the case 
of the Climate module because of the generally 
less advanced state of both GOOS and Canadian 
planning in these areas.  However, under the 
“Canada Oceans Act”, Canada has placed 
considerable emphasis in developing coastal zone 
management strategies and designating various 
ecologically sensitive areas as “Marine Protected 
Areas”.  Furthermore, Canada does have 
operational programs in these areas, especially as 
they relate to fisheries, fish habitat and overall 
marine environmental quality.  In an effort to 
evaluate the effectiveness of current monitoring 
programs in meeting Canada’s ecosystem 
objectives for integrated ocean management and 
conservation, a Canadian workshop will be held 
in the fall of 1999.  It is expected that, in addition 
to addressing Canadian issues, this workshop will 
clarify Canada’s input to the design of the LMR 
module and better indicate how Canada could 
most effectively contribute to this aspect of 
GOOS.

The Data Buoy Cooperation Panel (DBCP), 
which was formally established in 1985, is an 
official joint body of the World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO) and the Intergovernmental 
Oceanographic Commission (IOC).  It is a part of 
the WMO Marine Program and is planned for 
integration within the Global Ocean Observing 
System (GOOS) as a GOOS existing system.  The 
Panel members are representatives of all 
members of WMO or member states of IOC 
which are interested in participating in its 
activities (present representatives are from 
Australia, Canada, France, Greece, Iceland, 
Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, 
South Africa, United Kingdom and U.S.A.). 
 
Principal objectives of the DBCP are:  (1) review 
and analyze requirements for buoy data;  (2) co-
ordinate and facilitate deployment programs to 
meet requirements;  and (3) initiate and support 
action groups;  (4) improve quality and quantity 
of buoy data distributed on the Global Tele-
communication System (GTS);  (5) information 
exchange and technology development;  and (6) 
liaison with relevant bodies and programs. 
 
The next DBCP meeting will be held in 
Wellington, New Zealand, on October 26-30, 
1999.  Canada will be hosting a DBCP meeting in 
Victoria, B.C., on October 16-20, 2000.  PICES

It is well known that there are large changes in 
the size of commercial fish populations in the 
subarctic North Pacific on decadal time scales.  
These changes are associated with changes in the 
atmospheric forcing (displacement and change of 
strength of Aleutian and Arctic lows) and sea-
surface temperature in the region.  In order to 
understand the dynamics of the responses of the 
biological populations to large-scale air-sea 
interaction it is necessary to measure the changes 
in productivity of the ecosystem.  A recent 
example from the N. Atlantic system illustrates 
the problem.  Studies have shown that there is a 
strong statistical relationship between the phase of 
the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and 
plankton abundance (Fromentin and Plaque, 
1996).  However, in 1996-97 there was a strong 
phase shift in the NAO without a concomitant 
change in the plankton population (Planque and 
Reid, 1998).  Without the data from the N. 
Atlantic Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) 
survey of zooplankton, it would have been 
incorrectly presumed that the plankton 
populations also changed in the previously 
established way.

In its first meeting, the PICES MONITOR Task

Pacific zooplankton composition and abundance 
be initiated.  It was pointed out that there was a 
continuing observational program in the N. 
Atlantic which had successfully measured large-
scale plankton variability that was significantly

collection device is the CPR which is towed by 
ships-of-opportunity on monthly transects of the 
N. Atlantic.  The CPR was first used in 1931 and 
its sampling characteristics are well documented.  
 
In 2000, a two-year pilot CPR sampling program 
will be started in the N. Pacific under the 
leadership of Drs. David Welch (Canada) and 
Sonia Batten (UK).  Two lines of sampling will 
be run: a north-south run (line A) from Prince 
William Sound, Alaska, to Long Beach, 
California;  and an east-west run (line B) on a 
great circle route between Vancouver, British 
Columbia, and Yokohama, Japan (Fig. 1).  Line 
A (proceeding southward) samples Prince 
William Sound, the offshore region feeding the 
shelf downwelling zone, the center of the Gulf of 
Alaska Gyre, the Subactic Transition Zone and 
finally crosses the CALCOFI grid off California.  
Line B (proceeding westward) runs parallel to 
Canadian Line P, cuts across the shelf at the tip 
of the Alaska Peninsula and then runs northward 
of the Aleutians before it returns to the N. Pacific 
near the dateline.  The short-term research 
objective is to obtain data on the time and spatial 
structure of the near-surface plankton variability 
along these tracks.  The data set will be used to 
help in the design of a long-term zooplankton 
sampling program for the N. Pacific which will 
be able to monitor climate change variability.  Of 
course, there will be advances over time in the 
technology of estimating plankton abundance.  
Future plankton monitoring schemes will 
incorporate these improvements.

In its first meeting, the PICES MONITOR Task 
Team recommended that systematic, large-scale 
measurements of interannual variability of N. 
Pacific zooplankton composition and abundance 
be initiated.  It was pointed out that there was a 
continuing observational program in the N. 
Atlantic which had successfully measured large-
scale plankton variability that was significantly 
correlated with physical climate signals.  The 
collection device is the CPR which is towed by 
ships-of-opportunity on monthly transects of the 
N. Atlantic.  The CPR was first used in 1931 and 
its sampling characteristics are well documented.

In order to determine the present subarctic 
observational programs that are being carried out 
that contribute to the climate observing system, a 
survey was undertaken.  This study serves two 
functions:  (1) gaps in time and space coverage of 
the physical, chemical and biological climate 
variability are clearly identified;  and (2) specific 
efforts can be made to ensure that key elements 
of present monitoring work are identified and 
supported within GOOS.  The sampling carried 
out on these ships generally covers physical, 
chemical and biological variables. 
 
There are significant differences in the east-west 
coverage and sampling is not uniform among the 
various ships and surveys because different 
measurement techniques are employed on 
different ships (Fig. 2).  Nevertheless, the broad 
outline of Pacific monitoring programs is clear, 
with the western Pacific near Japan being much 
more intensely covered than the eastern Pacific, 
reflecting the long-term programs initiated and 
carried out by the Japanese.  Similar programs 
occur in the eastern Pacific (California Current 
survey (CalCOFI, U.S.A.), Ocean Station PAPA 
line (Canada), and the GAK line south of 
Seward, Alaska (U.S.A.)) but the overall 
coverage is lower.  The only substantial open 
ocean monitoring effort is the Canadian Line P 
program, with most other monitoring work 
confined to coastal or near-coastal waters. 
 
A significant difference in the level of monitoring 
is evident when monitoring locations are 
restricted to locations where sampling occurs at 
least twice per year (Fig. 3).  These observations 
are particularly important because shifts in 
seasonality are likely to be detected only when 
multiple samples are taken.  Wintertime 
observations are less frequent than summer 
observations because of the difficulties of 
operating most research vessels in heavy weather.  
Ship-of-opportunity (SOP) lines are less 
dependent on weather and may be able to provide 
more data in winter.

2.  Time series stations in the subarctic North Pacific 
 
a.  Moored measurements in the eastern subarctic Pacific

There are a number of ecological problems that 
require high time-resolution measurements of 
physical and biophysical variables.  Because the 
time scales of many biological processes are 
relatively short, it is necessary to resolve the 
high-frequency fluctuations in order to accurately 
represent the longer time-scale variability.  
Moored instruments are required to obtain the 
needed data sets.  Shipboard sampling is too 
coarse in time and satellite measurements do not 
represent the vertical structure of the variability.  
In the subarctic the conditions are harsh and new 
mooring designs are required to withstand the 
extreme environmental stresses.  In addition, new 
sensors need to be designed and evaluated to 
measure biophysical and chemical variables.  
Some prototype instruments capable of being 
moored do exist (pCO2, nitrate, transmissometer, 
and fluorometer). 
 
The Task Team was supportive of the pilot 
studies which have been initiated to moor suites 
of meteorological and oceanographic instruments 
in the subarctic.  The measurements are relayed 
to satellite daily.  A two-year program has been 
undertaken by the Pacific Marine Environmental 
Laboratory of NOAA near O CEAN Station 
PAPA (50°N 145°W).  The first mooring was 
deployed in September 1998, and replaced with 
another in September 1999.  In 1999 a second 
mooring was placed to the south in a more benign 
region in the subtropical gyre at 35°N 165°W.  
The subsurface measurements were successful on 
the first mooring but the surface instruments 
(largely meteorological) were lost in a severe 
storm after six months. 
 
The Task Team concludes that there will be a 
large scientific payoff for these efforts and 
recommends that these scientific and engineering 
studies be continued until the engineering 
problems are solved.  Mooring time series are 
necessary to successfully diagnose the 
relationships between meteorological forcing and 
physical and biological response in the ocean.  
Moorings are expensive and vast arrays are not 
possible.  The best use of the technique is to 
measure the vertical distribution of the variables 
in a region where the horizontal currents and 
advection are weak, under these conditions the 
pattern of time evolution of events below the 
surface can be documented and the processes 
surmised.

Planning for a global program to measure the 
distributions of temperature and salinity in the 
upper 2000 m is now underway.  The technique 
is to deploy an array of PALACE (profiling 
ALACE) floats on a 300×300 km grid.  The 
Palace float is designed to sink to a depth of  
2000 m where it will drift with the current until 
its buoyancy is internally modified so the float 
will rise to the surface;  a CTD is mounted on the 
float which measures the profiles of temperature 
and salinity on the ascent.  At the surface, the 
float is programmed to send the temperature and 
salinity data to a satellite.  The position of the 
float at the time of transmission is determined so 
that an estimate of the current at 2000 m can be 
determined from the displacement of the float 
over the time interval of submersion.  After the 
data has been transmitted, the float sinks to  
2000 m to begin another cycle.  With these data, 
the geostrophic current can be calculated.  The 
time between ascents will probably be 10 days.  
The measurement system is termed APEX 
(Autonomous Profiling Explorer).  The array is 
referred to as ARGO (Array for Real-time 
Geostrophic Oceanography). 
 
These data will be assimilated into a general 
circulation numerical model in support of the 
GODAE (Global Ocean Data Assimilation 
Experiment) which is a component of the global 
climate observing system now being planned.  
The goal of GODAE is to demonstrate the 
feasibility of routine, real-time global ocean data 
assimilation and prediction. 
 
The present communication system uses System 
Argos;  new improved satellite systems are under 
consideration.  Transmissions are lost if weather 
is poor (40% data loss occurs in rough weather).  
Since the data are transmitted many times, the 
chance of successful transmission is high.  
Deployment from high speed commercial ships-
of-opportunity is straightforward.  System Argos 
positions are accurate to 150 m.  The accuracy of 
the deep velocity measurement depends on the 
rate of the rise of the instrument and the parking 
time of the float at depth.  If the float is left at the 
surface for one inertial period, useful 
measurements of surface current can be made.  
Cost of the instrumented floats is about $14K.  In 
the early days salinity measurements were of 
poor quality because of fouling of the 
conductivity cell by biological organisms.  The 
use of anti-fouling paint appears to have 
alleviated this problem for periods up to 3 years. 
 
Commitments to fund ARGO have been 
forthcoming.  At present countries expected to 
supply floats are U.S.A., Canada, Japan, 
Australia, United Kingdom, France and 
Germany.  The deployment strategy and the 
development of a tracking and data distribution 
facility are presently being worked out. 
 
PICES will benefit greatly from the existence of 
an ARGO array in the subarctic Pacific.  In 
particular, the availability of a well-measured 
salinity field will make it possible to look at a 
large number of scientific questions that at 
present cannot be addressed because of the lack 
 
92 
opportunity occupying the KNOT station when 
passing near the site.  The suite of physical, 
chemical and biological measurements made 
depends on the capability of the scientific party

A wide variety of sampling gear has been used 
historically to measure zooplankton abundance.  
In order to create high-quality climate time series 
of zooplankton abundance, systematic errors that 
arise by combining measurements made with 
different sets of gear must b e addressed.  
Calibration of various systems must be 
undertaken to resolve this source of error.  The 
Task Team is undertaking a survey of the scope 
of the problem.  At the 1999, meeting results of a 
comparison of the performance of the NORPAC 
and SCOR plankton sampling nets (differing 
mouth size and same mesh size) were presented.  
Results of this study show that on the order of 40 
pairs of measurements were needed to estimate 
quantitatively the difference in sampling 
characteristics of the two systems.  It is clear that 
significant ship-time resources will be required to 
deal with the multiplicity of systems that have 
been used historically to collect zooplankton 
samples in the North Pacific.  The Task Team 
will facilitate further critical comparison studies.

Discussions at the PICES GOOS workshop held 
October 8 -9, 1999, led to the following 
recommendation to modify the terms of reference 
of the MONITOR Task Team.  The new 
activities of MONITOR will focus on developing 
an action plan that will assist in the 
implementation of GOOS at a North Pacific level 
and will assist in the transition of PICES 
GLOBEC monitoring activities to long-term 
monitoring activities of PICES-GOOS.  It was 
also decided that the action plan would:  (1) 
identify existing ocean observations in the coastal 
and open N. Pacific that are relevant to GOOS;  
(2) develop a PICES-GOOS implementation plan 
based on existing routine observations and 
augmented by new observations as appropriate;  
and (3) provide a structured plan on how to move 
relevant CCCC Program activities to a PICES-
GOOS program.

mouth size and same mesh size) were presented.  
Results of this study show that on the order of 40 
pairs of measurements were needed to estimate 
quantitatively the difference in sampling 
characteristics of the two systems.  It is clear that 
significant ship-time resources will be required to 
deal with the multiplicity of systems that have 
been used historically to collect zooplankton 
samples in the North Pacific.  The Task Team 
will facilitate further critical comparison studies.

Discussions at the PICES GOOS workshop held 
October 8 -9, 1999, led to the following 
recommendation to modify the terms of reference 
of the MONITOR Task Team.  The new 
activities of MONITOR will focus on developing 
an action plan that will assist in the 
implementation of GOOS at a North Pacific level 
and will assist in the transition of PICES 
GLOBEC monitoring activities to long-term 
monitoring activities of PICES-GOOS.  It was 
also decided that the action plan would:  (1) 
identify existing ocean observations in the coastal 
and open N. Pacific that are relevant to GOOS;  
(2) develop a PICES-GOOS implementation plan 
based on existing routine observations and 
augmented by new observations as appropriate;  
and (3) provide a structured plan on how to move 
relevant CCCC Program activities to a PICES-
GOOS program. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
94 
TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
1. Review existing activities of PICES member 
nations and to suggest improvements in the 
monitoring of the Subarctic Pacific to further 
the goals of the CCCC Program; 
 
2. Consult with REX, BASS and MODEL Task 
Teams and TCODE on the scientific basis for 
designing the PICES monitoring system.  
Questions of standardization and inter-
calibration of measurements, particularly in 
the area of biological collections, should be 
addressed; 
 
3. Assist in the development of a coordinated 
monitoring program to detect and describe 
events, such as El Niño, that strongly affect 
the Subarctic; 
 
4. Develop a PICES-GOOS action plan for how 
PICES should take an active and leading role 
in the further development and 
implementation of GOOS at a North Pacific 
level.  The action plan would: 
 
i. identify existing ocean observations in the 
coastal and open North Pacific that are 
relevant to GOOS; 
ii. develop a PICES-GOOS implementation 
plan based on existing routine 
observations and augmented by new 
observations as appropriate; 
iii. provide a structured plan on how to move 
relevant CCCC Program activities to a 
PICES-GOOS program. 
 
5. Advise and support the CCCC 
Implementation Panel and Science Board on 
GOOS-related matters, including representing 
PICES at key GOOS planning meetings.

REPORT OF THE 1999 REX TASK TEAM WORKSHOP 
 
Herring and Euphausiid population dynamics 
 
 
Spatial, temporal and life-stage variation in herring diets in British Columbia

Over the last 70 years in British Columbia 
(B.C.), herring stomachs have been examined by 
different people, in different years, at different 
places and at different herring life history stages.  
This brief report summarizes this information and 
attempts to provide some general conclusions. 
 
Wailes (1935) summarized the food of young 
herring mainly in the first summer of life.  At 
very young stages, eggs (ova) and nauplii from 
various invertebrates are most important.  
Copepod nauplii seem to dominate the food.  
Wailes noted that food varies with location and 
concluded that young herring fed on whatever 
food source was available.  A more recent project 
(1990-1994) gathered data on juvenile herring 
stomach contents in Georgia Strait, B.C.  The 
juveniles were distinguished by size and age as 
age 0+ (3-6 months), 1+ (15-18 months) and 
2+ (29-32 months).  The youngest juveniles (age 
0+) fed mainly on copepods.  The older and 
larger juveniles took various zooplankton, with 
euphausiids being common in the largest fish.  
The data indicate that diets and juvenile growth 
varied among areas.  There are a number of 
reports commenting on the diets of herring off the 
southwestern coast of B.C., and many comment 
on the frequency of euphausiids (mainly 
Euphausia pacifica, in herring guts.  This 
euphausiid species also is known to be a major 
component in the diets of other species, such as 
hake (Merluccius productus).  One example of 
the intensity of feeding was made by examination 
of stomach weights of herring feeding on E. 
pacifica during the fall of 1979.  Most guts 
examined contained E. pacifica.  In some 
individuals the gut weight was approximately 
20% of their total body weight.  In contrast to the 
apparently high incidence of euphausiids in 
southern BC herring adults, northern BC herring 
appear to rely more on copepods.  Adult herring 
guts, from Hecate Strait in northern BC were 
sampled in the summer and winter of 1985 and 
1987 (Tables 1 and 2).  The data indicates that 
copepods were dominant in the diets of herring in 
1985 and that euphausiids and amphipods were 
more common in 1987.  In general, the 
composition of food appeared to be more varied 
than that of herring found in southern B.C. 
 
Some general conclusions from this brief review 
are that herring diets vary with:  (1) life history 
stage (compared in the same time and place, 
herring food varies with size and age);  (2) space 
(compared among herring of same size and age, 
there are different food items among different 
locations), (3) time (food varies among seasons 
but within the same place and among years, 
compared at the same place). 
 
In general, larval herring rely mainly on 
copepods with the main diet consisting of 
copepod eggs and nauplii.  Juvenile herring (< 1 
year) eat mainly copepods (in BC) but older 
juvenile herring (> 1 year) eat many items.  The 
incidence of euphausiids increases with juvenile 
size.  Adult herring diets vary: euphausiids are 
important, but so are copepods in some areas. 
 
This review does not address the major issues

In general, larval herring rely mainly on

juvenile herring (> 1 year) eat many items.  The 
incidence of euphausiids increases with juvenile 
size.  Adult herring diets vary: euphausiids are 
important, but so are copepods in some areas. 
 
This review does not address the major issues 
 
96 
regarding the relationship between zooplankton 
and herring.  Perhaps the major question 
concerns the relationship(s) between plankton 
abundance and herring, and how it affects herring 
growth, population size and recruitment?  One 
may ask:  after more than a century of research in 
this area, why do we not understand it better?  A 
partial answer is that we have lack suitable time-
series data on plankton abundance.  Further, we 
know enough to understand that the relationships 
may be complex and affected by factors that we 
are only beginning to realize are important.

During the fall of 1995 and spring of 1996, the 
whole body energy content (WBEC) of Clupea 
pallasi from Prince William Sound (PWS), was 
examined.  Somatic energy exhibited a wide 
range of values relative to length (SL).  In the 
fall age 0 recruits had an average of 5.7 kJ·g
-1
 
wet wt for whole body samples vs 8.0 for age 1 
and 0.4-10.2 kJ·g
-1
 for fish of ages 2 to 7.  The 
following spring the 1995 year class, which had 
just survived their first winter, averaged       
4.4 kJ·g
-1
 wet wt for somatic samples, and age 
1 fish had similar values, while herring ages 2 
to 7 had WBEC>5 kJ·g
-1
.  The fall measures 
of WBEC showed the young-of-year and age 1 
fish stored markedly less energy for 
overwintering than older herring. 
 
In PWS many sea birds prey on juvenile 
herring.  During the spring and summer, we 
examined WBEC of herring £ 165 mm SL.

During the fall of 1995 and spring of 1996, the 
whole body energy content (WBEC) of Clupea 
pallasi from Prince William Sound (PWS), was 
examined.  Somatic energy exhibited a wide 
range of values relative to length (SL).  In the 
fall age 0 recruits had an average of 5.7 kJ·g
-1
 
wet wt for whole body samples vs 8.0 for age 1 
and 0.4-10.2 kJ·g
-1
 for fish of ages 2 to 7.  The 
following spring the 1995 year class, which had 
just survived their first winter, averaged       
4.4 kJ·g
-1
 wet wt for somatic samples, and age 
1 fish had similar values, while herring ages 2 
to 7 had WBEC>5 kJ·g
-1
.  The fall measures 
of WBEC showed the young-of-year and age 1 
fish stored markedly less energy for 
overwintering than older herring. 
 
In PWS many sea birds prey on juvenile 
herring.  During the spring and summer, we 
examined WBEC of herring £ 165 mm SL.  
 
98 
From May to October, somatic energy (kJ·g
-1
 
wet wt) exhibited a wide range of values 
relative to SL.  Young of the year recruits 
appeared in July and had WBEC of 2-3 kJ·g
-1
 
wet wt after metamorphosis and older fish had 
WBEC of 4 -6 kJ·g
-1
 wet wt.  By October the 
WBEC of juvenile herring was typically         
4-6 kJ·g
-1
 wet wt. 
 
Age 0 Pacific herring were surveyed in October 
of 4 years.  There were distinct regional and 
interannual variations in SL and WBEC for 
individual groups of herring.  Likewise within 
each collection there was typically a large range 
of size and WBEC values. 
 
Changes in WBEC of captive age 0 herring 
forced to fast during winter was measured and 
compared to cohorts collected in the field.  
Somatic energy content of fasting captives 
declined at a rate of 23 kJ·g
-1
 wet wt·d
-1
 from 1 
December 1995 to 25 January 1996 at mean 
temperature of 6.6°C.  In another observation, 
fish captured on 1 December 1995 and held 
without feeding until 1 April 1996 had an 
average WBEC that changed from 5.2 to      
3.2 kJ·g
-1
 wet wt during captivity at »5.2°C.  
Fish that died during fasts had WBEC values 
ranging from 2.8 to 3.6 kJ·g
-1 
 wet wt.  During 
March 1996 the WBEC of field collected age 0 
herring averaged 3.8 kJ·g
-1
, with »40% having 
WBEC £ 3.6 kJ·g
-1
 wet wt.  Thus, by March 
the average recruit had used most of its stored 
energy. 
 
These observations on WBEC of Pacific 
herring determined that in PWS, storing enough 
energy to survive the first winter is an 
important hurdle in the recruitment process. 
Energetically, the recruiting year class, and 
those entering their second winter, are the most 
at risk of nutritionally related overwinter 
mortality.  When modelling the transfer of 
energy from herring to predators fish age, time 
of collection, site of collection, SL, body wt all 
modify WBEC.  Even within age groups or 
schools there is a wide range in WBEC values 
which must be taken into account when 
producing consumption models.

Some authors consider the frequency of 
morphologically deformed herring larvae to be 
indicative of the quality of spawning substrate.  
The relative frequency of normal and deformed 
larvae in recently hatched herring eggs from 
natural and artificial spawning grounds has been 
determined in Severnaya Bay.  The maximal 
quantity (94%) of well-developed larvae hatched 
from roe was from artificial spawning substrate 
but was only 25% or less from the natural 
seagrass substrate ( Zostera marina).  The 
deformed larvae from natural substrates included 
the absence of a yolk sac (4.2%) or high water 
content (16.6%).  The principal deformities of 
larvae from artificial substrates were curvature of 
the spine (8%) and irregular head and tail parts 
(5% and 10%).  Approximately 50% of larvae 
with spinal curvature recovered about one day 
after hatching.

Pacific hake are the dominant resident species in 
the Strait of Georgia (Beamish and McFarlane, 
1999) and off the west coast of Vancouver Island 
in summer (Ware and McFarlane, 1995) – Figure 
1.  In the La Perouse Bank area, Pacific hake are a 
large migratory population.  During the 1960s, 
1970s and 1980s, they spawned off Baja, 
California during the winter and migrated north to 
summer feeding grounds (Francis, 1983).  Prior to 
1990, approximately 25 to 30% of the mature 
biomass moved into Canadian waters.  Since the 
early 1990s a much larger percentage of the stock 
(approximately 40%) was present in the Canadian 
zone. 
 
The fishery for Pacific herring dominated catches 
in the Strait of Georgia and off the west coast of 
Vancouver Island from the early 1950s until the 
mid-1960s (Schweigert and Fort, 1999).  The 
fishery collapsed in the mid-1960s and was closed 
from 1967 to 1971.  It re-opened in 1972 and has 
been largely regulated by market demands.  
 
Herring are now abundant in the Strait of Georgia 
and at low levels off the west coast of Vancouver 
Island (Fig. 2).  Predation on herring by hake off 
the west coast of Vancouver Island increased in 
direct relation to the increased northward 
migration of Pacific hake (Ware and McFarlane, 
1995).  However, hake in the Strait of Georgia 
reduced their predation on herring despite having a 
high biomass (Table 1).  After 1989, there was a 
shift to higher mean sea surface temperatures in 
both areas (Fig. 3) that was part of a large scale 
shift in climate/ocean conditions as seen in the 
change in the pattern of the Aleutian Low.  Off the 
west coast of Vancouver Island the high 
percentage of herring in the diet of hake 
(approximately 37% annually) is clear evidence of 
the preference of hake for herring as a prey (Table 
2).  This preference for herring and the large

In the Strait of Georgia, hake preference for
herring as a prey declined as a consequence of
smaller individual size.  Our observations of the
elimination of herring in the diet of hake in the
1990s is consistent with observations of
Tanasichuk et al. (1991), that hake smaller than
40 cm prey almost exclusively on euphausiids and
not on herring.

The temperature increases were measures of the
ecosystem change but clearly cannot be directly
related to the herring abundance trends in the two
areas. Thus, the increased temperature in the
Strait of Georgia was not associated with a
reduction in herring abundance as reported for the
west coast of Vancouver. Instead it was associated
with improved survival of hake.  It is the improved
survival that incre ased their numbers, reduced
individual growth, and eliminated predation on
herring.

A lesson from this study is that it is the nature of 
the "reorganization" of the ecosystem after a 
regime shift that determines the impacts on the 
population dynamics of a species. A measure of 
the change, such as temperature, is only one 
factor affecting the dynamics of populations. The 
opposite response of herring in the two 
ecosystems to the climate changes of 1977 and 
1989 in adjacent ecosystems, even though the 
temperature response was similar, indicates that 
single physical factors need to be related to the 
dynamics of ecosystems and not just to the 
observed effect on a single species. It also means 
that once we see indications that climate/ocean 
conditions are changing we need to monitor the 
direction of the new ecosystem organization and 
adapt our management strategies to this new 
reality.

Several spawning grounds of Pacific herring have 
been observed in the waters of Northern Japan.  
These spawners are genetically isolated from each 
other and these populations are classified into the 
following four types:  (I): lagoon-small migration 
type, (II): oceanic-wide migration type, (III): 
oceanic-small migration type and (IV): 
intermediate type between I and II.  The 
Hokkaido-Sakhalin population is one of the 
oceanic-wide migration type (II) and Mangoku-
ura population belongs to type III (Kobayashi, 
1993). 
 
Hokkaido-Sakhalin population 
Catch and catch at age data for the Hokkaido-
Sakhalin population are available since 1878.  
The annual catch was over 400,000 t from the 
late 19
th
 century to early in the 20
th
 century, with 
a historical peak of 970,000 t in 1897 (Fig. 1).  
However, the population has steadily declined 
thereafter with continual fluctuation, accompanied 
with the disappearance of spawning grounds from 
south to north in the west coast of Hokkaido.  In 
1955 the spawning ground completely 
disappeared from the coast of Hokkaido. 
 
Studies of year-class strength, spawner-recruit 
relationship and observations of oceanographic 
events led to a hypothesis that the factors 
controlling the year-class abundance of 
Hokkaido-Sakhalin population relate to the 
variations in the spring-summer oceanographic 
environmental condition.  This hypothesis has 
been tested by examining the data incorporated 
into a spawner-recruit pattern, for example, sea 
water temperature and food organism, obtained 
from spawning-nursery ground.  Oceanographic 
data for the west coast of Hokkaido area is 
limited, with data from some locations available.

events led to a hypothesis that the factors 
controlling the year-class abundance of 
Hokkaido-Sakhalin population relate to the 
variations in the spring-summer oceanographic 
environmental condition.  This hypothesis has 
been tested by examining the data incorporated 
into a spawner-recruit pattern, for example, sea 
water temperature and food organism, obtained 
from spawning-nursery ground.  Oceanographic 
data for the west coast of Hokkaido area is 
limited, with data from some locations available.  
Water temperature data for the west coast of 
 
104 
Hokkaido (Fig. 2) were obtained form Kamui, 
Yoichi, Takashima and Wakkanai and those data 
were analysed to examine the relationship 
between year-class strength and sea-water 
temperature. 
 
As with sea surface temperature there is a large 
interannual variation.  The annual mean seawater 
temperatures recorded at Takashima showed that 
an apparent rise in five year running mean after 
1910.  This tendency was generally seen in all 
locations off the west coast of Hokkaido.  The 
northerly shift of the spawning area of this 
population was much accelerated after 1910, 
though there still remained large extensions of the 
spawning grounds on the west coast, sufficient to 
yield a large catch as whole.  The records of 
seawater temperature at Kutsugata rose about 
1932 and the amount of catch in Hokkaido and 
South Sakhalin greatly declined after 1935.  
There was a remarkable decline in sea surface 
temperature from 1939-1945 and the temperature 
rose again after 1946.  The catch of herring was 
maintained to some extent up to 1953, but it 
declined greatly after 1955.  Drastic changes in 
the marine environment which occurred in about 
1955 would have accelerated the decrease in 
stock size and at the same time caused the 
changes in biology of the herring (Motoda and 
Hirano, 1963). 
 
In 1985, there was a sudden appearance of two 
year old herring (Fig. 3) on the west coast of 
Hokkaido (1983 year-class).  It is assumed that 
the spawning stock in 1983 was very small so that 
no information on spawning was obtained from 
the fishermen in 1983.  In 1987 and 1988 eggs 
spawned on the sea grasses were observed.  
Thereafter a 1988 year-class also appeared on the 
west coast but the size of the 1988 year-class was 
smaller than the 1983 year-class.  The decline of 
the seawater temperature was observed at 
Wakkanai in spring and early summer season in 
1983.  The recover of spawning by 1983 year-
class of Hokkaido-Sakhalin population was the 
event after thirty-three years’ absence. 
Interestingly, strong recruitment of the 1983 
year-class also appeared in George’s Bank 
herring and Norwegian spring herring.  Were 
these events the result of a coincidental 
conjunction or a teleconnection?  Unfortunately in 
recent years spawning of Hokkaido-Sakhalin 
population has not been observed along the coast 
of Hokkaido. 
 
Mangoku-ura population 
Only catch records from recent years are 
available for Mangoku-ura herring.  The catch 
gradually increased from 1975 and reached >500 
t in 1984, declining thereafter to <20 t by 1996.  
Strong year-classes have appeared every three 
years since 1975.  A significant relationship 
between the abundance of age 1 fish and the total 
number of eggs spawned by adult fish was not 
detected.  However it was reported that high 
survival rates were observed only when the sea 
temperature near the spawning ground (while 
herring were in the larval to juvenile stages) was 
<6°C (Fig. 4. Kodama, 1997).

The diet for larvae and juvenile stages is made up 
of copepods while the larvae of decapods and 
euphausiids are the most important prey in the 
young and adult stages. 
 
The stock size of Mangoku-ura herring tends to 
increase with the decline of the water temperature 
(Fig. 5).  It is closely related to the extension of 
Oyashio Cold Current to the southern part of off 
Sanriku area.  Therefore, the relationship 
between year-class strength and the catch of 
euphausid ( Euphausia pacificus) in the Pacific 
coast of northern Honshu was tentatively 
analysed.  Available data for 1970 to 1977 
showed a significantly high correlation between 
the amount of catch and the extension of cold 
waters, (<5°C at 100 m) in the area off 
northeastern Honshu during February through 
May (Odate, 1979).  The abundance of euphausid 
may affect the survival of juveniles and young 
herring and the nutritional condition of adult 
herring.  The relationship between the year-class 
strength of Mangoku-ura herring and the catch of 
euphausiids was examined and no statistically 
significant relationship was detected for 
observations taken during the same year.  There 
was also no significant relationship between year-
class strength and the catch of age one herring.  
For Mangoku-ura herring, year-class size and the 
catch of euphausiids was positively correlated 
with water temperature, however no relationship 
was found between year-class size and the catch 
of euphausiids.

Introduction 
For most fish populations, available records are 
too short to resolve decade or century scale 
fluctuations.  Here, the fine sedimentary fish 
remains record of Saanich Inlet is examined to 
infer fluctuations in fish population abundances – 
especially Pacific herring ( Clupea pallasi) – 
through the Holocene. 
 
Saanich Inlet 
Saanich Inlet is a temperate marine fjord on 
Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. 
The deep water in the inlet is anoxic for most of 
the year and therefore Saanich Inlet sediments 
accumulate undisturbed through time. 
 
Methods 
1. 5 high-resolution, large volume box cores

 area, 2-year sampling resolution 
• Detailed Pacific herring and hake

Introduction 
Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring is potentially the most 
abundant among all herring populations in the Far 
East.  During the last several decades, the status 
of that population has been extremely low.  A 
significant reduction in abundance began in 1940– 
50s and during the 1980–90s, the population 
appeared to be in a critical situation.  The reasons 
for the decline were discussed widely 
(Svetovidov, 1952; Probatov, 1958; Hirano, 
1961; Kondo, 1963; Motoda & Hirano, 1963; 
Birman, 1973; Pushnikova, 1981; 1996; 
Sokolovsky & Glebova, 1985).  A majority of 
scientists considered that the main reason of this 
phenomenon was a change in ocean conditions 
such as the warming in the northern Sea of Japan 
and adjacent areas.  Increasing commercial 
pressure on the Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring 
population is considered to be another important 
reason. 
 
It is well known that the abundance of each 
generation depends on many factors, both biotic 
and abiotic.  Prey abundance affects them to a 
considerable extent as well.  In the Tatar Strait, 
the zooplankton community, feeding structure 
and other problems connected with herring 
feeding were studied actively.  However, a 
question of the relationship between the biomass 
of the dominant zooplankton forms, the main 
components of herring feeding, and the number 
of Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring were not 
considered.  The aim of our work was to 
determine the relationship between the biomass of 
one of the main components of feeding 
(crustacean zooplankton such as Euphausiidae), 
the number of Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring 
generations and the biomass of predatory 
zooplankton.

Introduction 
Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring is potentially the most 
abundant among all herring populations in the Far 
East.  During the last several decades, the status 
of that population has been extremely low.  A 
significant reduction in abundance began in 1940–

Materials and methods
In this work the dependencies between the
abundance of Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring year-
class at age 1+ (given as calculated data),
biomass of small and large fractions of
euphausiid, and biomass of the predatory
zooplankton forms (Sagitta elegans is dominant
among them) which feed on herring larvae, and
small forms of the prey zooplankton are
considered. General zooplankton biomass and
copepod biomass data are reported as well. All
data are considered for spring and fall during the
period 1986-1992.
The abundance of Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring
year-classes was estimated from aircraft
observations and Pope’s cohort analysis. In
further analyses, the abundance of year-classes at
age 1 was displaced one year forward.
Zooplankton data were collected during the
seasonal (spring and fall) hydrobiological surveys
carried out at the standard stations. A total of
700 stations was occupied. A Juday net
(diameter of input hole – 0.37 m) was used to
collect zooplankton samples and an egg and
larvae net (diameter of input hole – 0.37 m). The
samples were collected by hauling the 0-100 m
layer.
The method of zooplankton determination was
standard. For Juday samples, a division on
fractions was applied and a catching efficiency
was used for different systematic and dimensional
zooplankton groups. All data given in the report
on the condition of zooplankton community are
averages for the study area. Temperature was
considered on the line of Slepikovsky Cape – the
sea at 0-50 and 50-100 m layers averaged for
April-May (spring) and September-November
(fall).
Results
The main region of Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring
inhabitation at present time is the southwestern
coast of the Tartar Strait (Sea of Japan).
Spawning, embryogenesis, and feeding of fry and
fingerlings take place here. Within the Tartar
Strait mature herring form the prespawning
stocks in March-May, and then feeding stocks in
June-October, mainly in the region between 47-
49 N near Sakhalin shelf and slope. The most
intensive herring eat during the prespawning and
after spawning periods in June-July. In August-
September the intensity of feeding somewhat falls
down. As a rule, the greatest stocks are being
formed in places with significant water
temperature gradients and high zooplankton
biomass.
The base of feeding for herring juveniles near the
southwestern  Sakhalin  is  formed  by
Harpacticoida, Coryphiidae, Calanoida, and
Euphausiidae. Adult fish eat mainly Calanus,
Euphausiidae, Sagitta, and Mysidae i.e. the
largest and most abundant forms of plankton.
In the area of the southern Tatar Strait,
hydrobiological surveys found 4 species of
Euphausiidae in the samples. These included the
the cold water species Thysanoessa raschii, T.
inermis, T. longipes and a moderately-cold water
species Euphausia pacifica. At the end of April
to the beginning of May, the eggs, nauplii,
calyptopis and furcilia stages were present
together with adult specimens. In spring T.
inermis was dominant in both frequency and
biomass. Its average biomass in the region was
23.76 mg·m-3. In autumn, T. longipes occurred
most often, their density was not high –
7.77 mg·m-3. As to biomass of euphausiids on
the whole, its value is small and varies from 4 to
58 mg·m-3 in spring and from 6 to 40 mg·m-3 in
autumn, making from 1 to 9.6% of total
zooplankton biomass. Table 1 shows that the
biomass of euphausiids does not play a leading
part and their share does not exceed the average
8.0% in the community.
During the study period extensive stocks of
euphausiids with high biomass, like those
described in the literature for the 1950–70s, were
not found. Euphausiids were not dominant in
herring stomach samples as well.

Pseudocalanus minutus are the base of herring 
diet in recent years.  These are the dominant 
plankton in the zooplankton community structure 
in the southern Tatar Strait.  On a study area 
copepod prevailed in zooplankton community as 
in spring, so in autumn (Table 1).

Comparison of herring abundance with total 
zooplankton biomass and biomass of copepods 
has shown that in spring their indices are out of 
phase.  For autumn period a similar tendency was 
not evident because this season is characterized 
not only by the active consumption of plankton by 
herring, walleye pollock, cod juveniles, and 
capelin, but also the development of a complex 
community of neritic zooplankton species (Fig. 
1). 
 
Despite the fact that the base of the Tatar Strait 
zooplankton community and the base of herring 
diet are copepods, we have considered a 
relationship between a number of herring year-
classes and the biomass of euphausiids, so far as 
this zooplankton group is important in the diet of 
herring, especially juveniles.  For the period 
between 1986–1992, the most numerous year-
class of herring was observed in 1988.  The 
number of 1 year old individuals reached 312.4 
million. This was a harvestable generation during 
a period of generally weak recruitment during the 
1980s and early 1990s.  Though its abundance 
was lower than the 1983 generation, it was a 
harvestable year-class from 1984 –1995. 
 
During the period 1986–1992, a relatively high 
biomass of euphausiids was recorded in the 
spring of 1990 and in spring and autumn 1992.  
Our observations indicated that in 1987, the year 
before the formation of the harvestable year-
class, and in 1988, the biomass of euphausiids 
was below the interannual level. A small fraction 
of euphausiids, which in summer-autumn period 
is one the main dietary components for herring 
fingerlings was not high as well.  Zooplankton 
predators’ biomass in spring was also low (Fig. 
2). 
 
Fig. 1 Total biomass of zooplankton and 
herring generation 
 
 
In 1988, a significant negative temperature 
anomaly in the 0 –50 and 50–100 m layers in 
southern Tatar Strait was registered, and most 
clearly observed in the spring period (see Figures 
4 and 5).  In 1989–1990, high values for total 
euphausiid biomass were distinctive in spring and 
autumn and high values of zooplankton predators 
were found as well.  Small zooplankton fractions 
were distinguished by the low biomass, especially 
in autumn period (Fig. 3).  Unlike 1988, these 
years had positive temperature anomalies (Fig. 3 
and 4). 
 
A significant negative correlation was observed 
only between the number of herring and the 
biomass of small euphausiids in spring ( -0.72) 
and biomass of predators in spring (-0.87).  But

A relationship between the number of herring, 
autumn and spring biomass of euphausiids and 
water temperature was not evident.  But for the 
year in which the 1988 herring year-class was 
formed, low water temperatures in the upper 
layer in spring and autumn, and low values of 
euphausiid biomass occurred as well.  In general, 
a feedback between the number of herring and 
biomass of euphausiids and predators was 
observed.  However, some clear dependency on 
interannual scale between the number of herring 
generations and biomass of euphausiids was not 
determined for a study period.  It is probably 
caused to the fact that euphausiids are not the 
main component of the herring feeding, and to 
the reduction of a total euphasiid biomass 
coincided with the period of depression of the 
Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring population.

such situation occurs only in the summer period, 
since the new generation of herring begins to eat 
small zooplankton in summer, at the same time 
the predators begin to act.

A relationship between the number of herring, 
autumn and spring biomass of euphausiids and 
water temperature was not evident.  But for the 
year in which the 1988 herring year-class was 
formed, low water temperatures in the upper 
layer in spring and autumn, and low values of 
euphausiid biomass occurred as well.  In general, 
a feedback between the number of herring and 
biomass of euphausiids and predators was 
observed.  However, some clear dependency on 
interannual scale between the number of herring 
generations and biomass of euphausiids was not 
determined for a study period.  It is probably 
caused to the fact that euphausiids are not the 
main component of the herring feeding, and to 
the reduction of a total euphasiid biomass 
coincided with the period of depression of the 
Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring population.

Krill constitute a key component in oceanic food 
webs.  They have a diverse diet and are 
prominent prey for fish.  The search strategies of 
fish foraging on krill differ among species, 
locations, and time of day and may involve visual 
search as well as ambush feeding based on 
hydrodynamic signals created by the swimming 
prey.  This talk addresses the feeding behaviour 
of herring ( Clupea harengus), whiting 
(Merlangius merlangus) and Norway pout 
(Trisopterus esmarki) foraging on krill 
(Meganyctipahnes norvegica), mainly based on 
research carried out in the Oslofjord, Norway.

Herring in the study area school above the krill at 
day, schools disperse at night and herring then 
forage on vertically migrating krill.  Nocturnal 
predation is probably visual, and seems to be 
restricted to the upper 20-30 m.  The non-
schooling whiting lives deeper than herring, 
occupying the same depth range, and performing 
a similar diel migration pattern to that of krill.  
They forage on krill throughout the diel cycle.  
Prey search may be visual both day and night, 
and whiting appears to be able to forage at lower 
light intensities (i.e. deeper water) than herring.  
Norway pout is semi-demersal, largely remaining 
associated with the bottom at day, migrating into 
the water column at night.  They forage on krill 
by day where the bottom intercepts the krill 
daytime habitat, otherwise predation is nocturnal 
by vertically migrating individuals ascending into 
the water column.  Norway pout has large eyes, 
and may forage visually in relatively deep water 
at day.  Their swimming behaviour, hanging 
motionless in the water column, does, however, 
suggest that they may be ambush feeders by 
night. 
Krill antipredator behaviour includes a flexible 
DVM pattern, apparently responding to the 
presence of fish.  They partly remain below 
visually foraging pelagic fish at day, but may 
avoid the near-bottom zone in presence of 
demersal fish. In waters devoid of nocturnally 
foraging planktivores, vertically migrating krill 
ascend all the way to the surface. while they 
modify their DVM pattern and largely avoids the 
upper 20-30 m at night in waters with abundance 
of nocturnally foraging fish.  Antipredator 
behaviour also constitutes instantaneous escape 
responses upon encounters with fish.  The talk 
also addresses how more subtle mechanisms like 
modification of feeding and swimming behaviour 
in response to mortality risks may be studied in 
the field.  I argue that acoustic studies, 
comprising acoustic target tracking of individual 
plankters and fish, hold yet unexploited 
opportunities for studies of fish-krill interactions 
and for understanding of both krill and fish 
behaviour.

The paper is based on long-term information 
(1939-1998) from weight method examination of 
2997 stomach content from 117 coastal stations in 
Karaginsky Bay, Olyutorsky Bay, Olyutorsky-
Navarin area, and 1486 stomach examinations at 
9 daily stations.  Rations were calculated in three 
ways:  (1) using daily station data;  (2) a 
physiological method using the well-known 
Vinberg equation;  and (3) our identification of a 
strong dependence between daily ration, body 
weight, stomach fullness index, and water 
temperature. 
 
Food composition and trophic activity by Korfo-
Karaginsky herring are very labile among years, 
seasons, areas, age cohorts.  The herring diet 
(excluding the larval stages) contains 70 species 
of marine animals from 13 classes.  The 
dominant prey is copepods which make up more 
than a half (51.7%) of the annual ration.  The 
portion of euphausiids in the diet fluctuates 
annually from 9.8% to 70.7% with average value 
42.1%.  In May – September the herring feed 
mainly on copepods – from 49.9% in September 
to 88.4% in July.  During other months, 
euphausiids contribute 68-88% of the stomach 
contents. 
 
The variability of the herring diet is related to age 
composition.  Through summer and autumn, age

The variability of the herring diet is related to age 
composition.  Through summer and autumn, age 
 
114 
0+ to age 2+ individuals are found mainly in 
Karaginsky Bay; age 3+ in Olyutorksy Bay, and 
age 4+ to age 7+ are adjacent to the Koryak 
Coast/Elder.  Herring reach Far Eastern areas 
and during periods of high abundance, they 
inhabit offshore waters.  Diet composition is in 
high conformity with habitat: 4 -year-old and 
older individuals feed more on euphausiids while 
the younger fish feed on copepods. 
 
The annual consumption of euphausiids by the 
population is from 1.3 (depressed condition) to 
8.7 (high stock abundance) million tonnes.  On 
average, each individual feeds from 0 .39 kg 
(32,000 individuals) to 0.54 kg (45,000 
individuals) of these class organisms. 
 
 
Interactions Between Fish and Euphausiids and Potential Relations to Climate and 
Recruitment

The interaction of euphausiids and fish is 
complex.  Each at times may be the predator, 
prey, or competitor of the other.  However, 
certain interactions may be dominant.  Here, I 
present preliminary data consistent with one such 
interaction, predation by euphausiids on sardine 
and anchovy eggs in the California Current 
Region.  
 
High resolution maps of near-surface distributions 
of euphausiids and the eggs of the Pacific sardine 
(Sardinops sagax) and northern anchovy 
(Engraulis mordax) were made during CalCOFI 
cruise 9603JD using the Continuous, Underway 
Fish Egg Sampler, CUFES (Checkley et al. 
1997, in press).  This device collects eggs of fish 
from 3-m depth continuously during a survey by 
a ship at full speed.  Eggs of the target species 
are identified live at sea, for near-real-time 
mapping and adaptive sampling, and all eggs are 
identified and counted ashore in preserved 
samples.  At sea, simultaneous measurement is 
made of date, time, location, temperature, 
salinity, and chlorophyll a fluorescence. 
Euphausiids and other plankters are collected as 
“by-catch” of the egg sampling. 
 
Sardine and anchovy eggs sampled during 
CalCOFI cruise 9603JD were distributed in a 
complementary fashion. Sardine eggs were most 
abundant along the inner edge of the California 
Current, north of Point Conception, in waters 
characteristic of isopycnal shoaling.  Anchovy 
eggs were in water upwelled either recently 
(cool) or in the past (warmed), mostly south of 
Pt. Conception.  An analogous cruise in March 
1997 yielded very similar results.  
 
Despite sampling caveats, including possible 
avoidance of the near-surface intake of the 
CUFES pump by euphausiids and diel variation 
in their surface residence, the patterns of sardine 
and anchovy eggs and euphausiids were 
complementary during CalCOFI cruise 9603JD.  
The figure below shows that sardine eggs were 
abundant only in the absence of euphausiids and 
vice versa. 
 
Similar results have been obtained off northern 
Peru for eggs of the anchoveta ( Engraulis 
ringens) and euphausiids.  This is work in 
progress in collaboration with Dra. Guadalupe 
Sanchez (Instituto del Mar del Peru).  In essence, 
anchoveta eggs and euphausiids, occurred but not 
together. 
 
The most parsimonious explanation of these 
patterns is euphausiid predation on sardine eggs.  
These results and those of others indicated that 
variation in the abundance and distribution of 
 
114 
0+ to age 2+ individuals are found mainly in 
Karaginsky Bay; age 3+ in Olyutorksy Bay, and 
age 4+ to age 7+ are adjacent to the Koryak 
Coast/Elder.  Herring reach Far Eastern areas 
and during periods of high abundance, they 
inhabit offshore waters.  Diet composition is in 
high conformity with habitat: 4 -year-old and 
older individuals feed more on euphausiids while 
the younger fish feed on copepods. 
 
The annual consumption of euphausiids by the 
population is from 1.3 (depressed condition) to 
8.7 (high stock abundance) million tonnes.  On 
average, each individual feeds from 0 .39 kg 
(32,000 individuals) to 0.54 kg (45,000 
individuals) of these class organisms.

characteristic of isopycnal shoaling.  Anchovy 
eggs were in water upwelled either recently 
(cool) or in the past (warmed), mostly south of 
Pt. Conception.  An analogous cruise in March 
1997 yielded very similar results.  
 
Despite sampling caveats, including possible 
avoidance of the near-surface intake of the 
CUFES pump by euphausiids and diel variation 
in their surface residence, the patterns of sardine 
and anchovy eggs and euphausiids were 
complementary during CalCOFI cruise 9603JD.  
The figure below shows that sardine eggs were 
abundant only in the absence of euphausiids and 
vice versa. 
 
Similar results have been obtained off northern 
Peru for eggs of the anchoveta ( Engraulis 
ringens) and euphausiids.  This is work in 
progress in collaboration with Dra. Guadalupe 
Sanchez (Instituto del Mar del Peru).  In essence, 
anchoveta eggs and euphausiids, occurred but not 
together. 
 
The most parsimonious explanation of these 
patterns is euphausiid predation on sardine eggs.  
These results and those of others indicated that 
variation in the abundance and distribution of 
 
115 
euphausiids may significantly affect survival of 
planktonic eggs and larvae and hence recruitment 
of sardine and other species of fish.

Predation and competition require overlap in 
distributions of species populations, which, in 
turn, depend on available habitat.  Climate 
variation will affect interactions between fish and 
euphausiids in part through e xpansion, 
contraction, and overlap of such habitats and 
hence the distributions of the species involved.  A 
high priority should be given to characterizing 
such habitats and their variation.  The use of 
standardized and coordinated techniques of data 
collection and analysis is recommended.  This is 
one area in which PICES might take a leadership 
role.  Additional work is also needed on the 
biology of euphausiids and, in particular, their 
feeding on fish eggs and larvae. Seminal work 
was done by Theilacker (1993), but further work 
is needed in order to quantify the predatory 
impact of euphausiids on fish eggs and larvae.

In the 1990s, Pacific herring became one of the 
dominant species in the western Bering Sea 
pelagic fish community, especially in the sea 
shelf zone.  The Korf-Karaginsky herring 
population has a leading role in total fishery 
biomass and herring fishery harvest in the 
western Bering Sea as in 1960s, when the harvest 
totalled up to 268,000 mt (Kachina, 1981).  
Whereas, during the 1980s, the harvest did not 
exceed 32,000 mt. Since the early 1990s, walleye 
pollock biomass has noticeably declined due to 
global climate change and reorganizations of the 
fish community structure.  Herring have occupied 
a leading place in the southwestern Bering Sea

a leading place in the southwestern Bering Sea 
 
116 
pelagic layer likely since fall of 1994.  Dr. N. I. 
Naumenko (pers. comm.) considers that the total 
Korf-Karaginsky herring biomass is equal to 1.7 
million tonnes now.  It is at least three times 
greater than for other pelagic fish species in the 
southwestern Bering Sea shelf. 
 
Assessing the possible effects of increasing 
herring abundance on further reorganization of 
the community structure in the western Bering 
Sea is one from objectives of future studies.  
High abundance gives herring and important role 
as plankton consumers and as forage fish for 
upper trophic level predators.  The dynamics of 
herring spatial distribution is of special interest in 
this aspect as it could determine role and 
contribution of herring to the organic matter 
transport through fish community trophic net in 
the Bering Sea shelf and offshore zones. 
 
Material and methods 
The TINRO-Center database of integrated 
ecosystem studies consists of materials from 
twelve complex expeditions carried out from 
1986 to 1990 by Russian investigators in the 
western and central Bering Sea (Shuntov and 
Radchenko, 1999).  Surveys in the central Berign 
Sea occurred only from 1988-1990. From 1991-
1995, the survey area was limited to the 
southwestern part of the Bering Sea.  The 
epipelagic layer (0-200 m) was investigated in all 
12 expeditions.  Fish sampling was conducted 
using a pelagic rope trawl, basically 108/528 m.  
The trawl bag (length 30-40 m) had mesh size of 
30 mm and small-mesh insert (6-12 mm) of 
length 15m in back part.  Archival data of 1,914 
trawl hauls executed in these expeditions in upper 
epipelagic layer were analysed on distribution, 
abundance and feeding habits of fish and squids 
species to collate them with recently collected 
materials. 
 
Since 1995 the bottom trawl and hydro-acoustic 
surveys were conducted in the western Bering 
Sea only. Walleye pollock stock assessment was 
the main objective of these expeditions until 
1998.  Last year, the first integrated expedition 
was conducted in this region.  The set of 
expeditionary studies included oceanological, 
planktonic, bottom and trawl-acoustic surveys 
with accompanying work on data processing.  
For all common fish and squid species, feeding 
habits and biology characteristics have been 
examined.  This regional coverage included the 
continental shelf and upper slope of the western 
Bering Sea between depths 49 to 509 m and 
totalled 37,000 square miles (Fig. 1).  A bottom 
trawl survey (36 hauls) was conducted from 
August 21 to October 4, 1998.  The distance 
between survey transects was 40 miles in the 
Anadry Gulf, Navarinsky region, and along the 
Koryak coast, but 20 miles in the Olyutorsky and 
Karaginsky Bays. The distance between hauls 
varied from 5 to 20 miles.  The survey was 
executed by bottom trawl of 35/41m model.  In 
October, an acoustic survey was conducted on the 
same area with several pelagic trawl hauls.  
These data give us additional data on herring 
distribution and seasonal migrations. 
 
Herring stomachs and alimentary tracts were 
collected during biological investigations after 
trawl survey hauls.  Daily diet calculation was 
conducted using the method of A. Kogan (1963) 
for fish that had well-expressed diurnal rhythms. 
Stomacbs from 205 herring specimens have been 
processed.  Daily diet values and composition 
have been determined for all common pelagic and 
groundfish species. 
 
Result 
Data from 1998 showed that herring aggregations 
did not occur outside the shelf zone (Fig. 2) 
despite both direct and indirect evidence of 
increasing abundance.  During the bottom trawl 
survey, herring accounted for only 1.5% of the 
total fish biomass.  Indeed, it was determined by 
insignificant vertical opening of of the mouth of 
bottom trawl, was unable to catch whole schools 
of migrating herring. 
 
Herring rarely occurred in trawl catches (no more 
than 5 fish per 30 minute haul) in the Anadry 
Gulf and northern waters off the Koryak Coast.  
Relatively high herring catches occurred in the 
western and central Koryak Coast (westward 
from 175°E) and in the eastern Olyutorsky Bay.

Relatively high herring catches occurred in the 
western and central Koryak Coast (westward 
from 175°E) and in the eastern Olyutorsky Bay.  
 
117 
Maximal herring catch was at 1.5 tons, or about 
5,000 fish per 30 minute haul (Fig. 2). 
 
In October, herring was chiefly distributed in the 
Karaginsky and Olyutorsky bays (Fig. 3). 
Herring school records occurred in pelagic layer 
as pile-shaped spots, sometimes from bottom to 
sea surface.  Maximal catch reached 6 mt, or 
more than 19,000 fish per 30 minutes pelagic 
haul.  Herring aggregations had length of 2 miles 
and a height of about 25 m in that area. 
 
Herring aggregations were represented by 
specimens sized 29 – 32 cm and at age 4+ to age 
5+ in the Karaginsky and Olyutorsky Bays.  This 
supports a previous understanding of the 
predominance of two year-classes in the Korf-
Karaginsky herring population – 1993 and, to a 
lesser degree, 1994.  These fish had body lengths 
(FL) 29-34 cm at survey time and contributed 
75.5% of the total herring numbers on the 
Koryak shelf, and in the southwestern Bering Sea 
bays.  However, the portion of older age groups 
was higher on the Koryak shelf (1991–1992 year-
classes).  Whereas, the numbers of herring aged 
3+ (FL = 23-27 cm) was remarkable in the 
continental slope area off the Karaginsky and 
Olyutorsky bays.  In near-shore waters, herring 
of third marine year (1996 year-class, FL = 21-
23 cm) were fixed in survey catches.  Age 
distribution of Korf-Karaginsky herring is 
presented in Figure 4 for the southwestern Bering 
Sea bays. 
 
Several euphausiid species formed the base of the 
herring food supply in all survey regions (Table 
1).  Their contribution varied from 35.6 to 100% 
of the herring diet in different regions. Copepods 
contributed from 5 to 20.9% of the daily diet. 
Chaetognaths, gammarids, hyperiids, and 
decapods’ larvae also occurred in the herring 
diet.  Herring sized 30-35 cm had significant 
distinction from smaller size groups in the 
Karaginsky and Olyutorsky Bays.  They mainly 
fed on walleye pollock juveniles which 
contributed 54.3% of daily diet.  Stomach 
fullness varied from 42.7-151.7‰ for herring 
sized 25-40 cm. Smaller herring from the 
southwestern Bering Sea bays fed more 
intensively with average stomach fullness at 
290.8‰.  Daily diet value amounted 3.0% of 
body weight for fish sized 25-30 cm and 2.7% - 
for fish sized 30 – 35 cm. 
 
Discussion 
The annual cycle of the Korf-Karaginsky herring 
has been adequately studied.  After spawning, it 
is well known that adult herring have an 
extensive migration route until late September-
October.  These migrations cover the continental 
shelf and slope zones from Goven Cape to the 
Navarin Cape (Panin, 1951; Prokhorov, 1967; 
Kachina, 1981). 
 
Some relationship has been observed between the 
direction and intensity of herring migration with 
the oceanological regime in the area.  In late June 
of 1991, adult herring occurred in the shallowest 
areas as seasonal heating did not significantly 
penetrate in the water column.  Despite the 
anomalous high ocean temperature at the surface 
(7.5 – 9.6ºC), it declined rapidly to 0.1 – 0.8ºC 
at a depth of 20 – 25 m, especially in the eastern 
part of the Olyutorsky Bay.  Water inflow from 
the offshore zone was observed in the central part 
of the bay.  The main herring aggregations were 
distributed on the periphery of the gradient zone 
where water flowed onto the shelf (Fig. 5a). 
 
The same situation occurred in July 1992.  
Weakly transformed Pacific waters have flowed 
there from the Near Strait region, and the 
resulting gradient zone formed in the western part 
of Olyutorsky Bay.  Water flow onto the shelf 
was more intensive in 1992 than in 1991. 
Consequently, the herring concentration was 
significantly higher there.  Adult herring (24-30 
cm, mean 26.8 cm) catches reached 3 t per one-
hour haul.  Numerous herring schools occurred in 
the 4 – 25 m stratum (Fig. 5b).

5,000 fish per 30 minute haul (Fig. 2).

In early July of 1993, water inflow onto the shelf 
from the offshore zone was limited and did not 
effect the SST distribution.  Slight curvatures of 
the isohaline contours indicated weak water 
inflow in the western Olyutorsky Bay (Fig. 5c).  
Herring were not aggregated in the bay at that 
time.  Most herring schools likely migrated 
eastward from the Olyutorsky Cape.  In trawl 
catches herring occurred in insignificant 
quantities (up to 0.23 tons per one-hour haul) in 
the depth range 60-120m. 
 
In June–July of 1995 the situation occurred again 
like to 1992.  Relatively weak flow was directed 
along the continental shelf edge from the 
Olyutorsky Cape to Karaginsky Island.  Inflow of 
weakly transformed Pacific water was blocked by 
an anticyclonic eddy located 60 miles southwest 
of Olyutorsky Cape.  Herring sized 26-37cm 
(mean 29.8 cm) occurred sporadically in trawl 
catches, mainly in the Olyutorsky Bay.  The 
density of herring was in 3.5 times less than in 
1993. 
 
In 1991–1995, adult herring fed mainly upon 
euphausiids (Thysanoessa inermis) and copepods 
(Eucalanus bungii) in May – June, the period of 
the highest feeding intensity.  During these two 
months, zooplankton consumption by herring 
contributes about 40% from annual food ration or 
approximately 1.95 kg of food per fish. In July, 
the herring daily diet is noticeable lower – from

In early July of 1993, water inflow onto the shelf 
from the offshore zone was limited and did not 
effect the SST distribution.  Slight curvatures of 
the isohaline contours indicated weak water 
inflow in the western Olyutorsky Bay (Fig. 5c).  
Herring were not aggregated in the bay at that 
time.  Most herring schools likely migrated 
eastward from the Olyutorsky Cape.  In trawl 
catches herring occurred in insignificant 
quantities (up to 0.23 tons per one-hour haul) in 
the depth range 60-120m. 
 
In June–July of 1995 the situation occurred again 
like to 1992.  Relatively weak flow was directed 
along the continental shelf edge from the 
Olyutorsky Cape to Karaginsky Island.  Inflow of 
weakly transformed Pacific water was blocked by 
an anticyclonic eddy located 60 miles southwest 
of Olyutorsky Cape.  Herring sized 26-37cm 
(mean 29.8 cm) occurred sporadically in trawl 
catches, mainly in the Olyutorsky Bay.  The 
density of herring was in 3.5 times less than in 
1993. 
 
In 1991–1995, adult herring fed mainly upon 
euphausiids (Thysanoessa inermis) and copepods 
(Eucalanus bungii) in May – June, the period of 
the highest feeding intensity.  During these two 
months, zooplankton consumption by herring 
contributes about 40% from annual food ration or 
approximately 1.95 kg of food per fish. In July, 
the herring daily diet is noticeable lower – from 
 
119 
11.7% of body weight during the feeding peak, to 
2.9 – 3.0%, then to 1.9 – 2%.  In August and 
September of 1991 – 1995, herring fed upon a 
wide spectrum of planktonic organisms in the 
Olyutorsky Bay:  pteropod molluscs (25.2% on 
average, and in some years up to 77.9%), 
hyperiids (13.8%), pollock and capelin 
underyearlings (3.7–4%).  During the 1980s, fish 
juveniles contributed 6% of herring diet.  Herring 
annually consumed about 3,700 t of juvenile 
pollock and 6,400 t of capelin.  On the area off 
Koryak Coast herring chiefly consumed copepods 
with Neocalanus cristatus predominant in August 
and September.  The euphausiid portion has been 
estimated at 14% of daily diet in these months.  
In October the euphausiid portion increased and 
in December it reached 98% (Table 2). 
 
In 1998, the herring diet composition was similar 
to that of the first half of 1990s.  Euphausiids 
became a predominant food object and the 
smaller copepod E. bungii was replaced by N. 
cristatus.  The daily diet value was higher for this 
season than in previous years of the study.  
According to o ur estimation, 1.7 million t of 
herring consumed about 45,000 t of food daily, 
mainly zooplankton (39,800 t).  Euphausiids 
contributed about 21,500 t, equal to more than 
half of the total forage zooplankton biomass.  The 
estimated euphausiid biomass, based on 
integrated surveys of the area, was 922,000 t on 
the continental shelf and slope zones off the 
Koryak Coast and in the southwestern Bering Sea 
bays.  It means that herring are able to consume 
64.1% of the total herring biomass during one 
month.

It can be concluded that general pattern of water 
circulation likely has a greater effect on herring 
distribution than other features of physical 
environment.  Herring aggregations are chiefly 
distributed in zones of water inflow onto the shelf 
from the offshore.  Water flow onto the shelf 
provides a permanent transport of adult 
zooplankton organisms, which chiefly inhabit the 
offshore zone in summer season.  Large 
zooplankton organisms predominate in the 
herring diet after spawning and their portion 
gradually increases until late fall.  If water inflow

has developed by June to early July, herring 
schools remain within the bay for feeding.  
Otherwise, the herring move quickly eastwards 
from Olyutorsky Cape.  It should also be noted 
that herring aggregations have been observed 
along the Koryak Coast in the gradient zone 
periphery near the Central Bering Sea Current 
entrance of shelf and divergence (Prokhorov, 
1967).  In early August of 1987, herring catches 
reached there 18 tons per one-hour trawling. 
 
Euphausiids are characterized by high potential 
production.  The annual productivity to biomass 
ratio (P/B) is approximately 8 (Ponomareva, 
1990).  Since the main growth in weight of 
euphausiids takes place in warmer half-year, we 
can imagine that the euphausiid biomass is 
doubled every two months.  These crustaceans 
are consumed rather intensively in the ecosystem.  
Walleye pollock, salmon, and other fishes feed 
on euphausiids.  Some tightness is evident in the 
corresponding links of the shelf fish community 
trophic web. 
 
Extpansion of feeding areas is an inherent 
characteristic of pelagic fishes during high 
abundance (Blaber, 1991).  In the 1980s, 
abundant walleye pollock migrations were 
observed in the offshore Bering Sea basins and a 
large-scale fishery developed there.  The total 
walleye pollock harvest in the Donut Hole 
reached 1.3 million tons in 1988.  Will herring 
migrate in the offshore western Bering Sea to 
utilize its food resources or not? 
 
The Korf-Karaginsky herring migrations through 
western Commander Basin were determined 
during the 1960s (Kachina, 1981).  It is evident 
from herring distribution maps in this publication 
that herring were found offshore, although the 
author did not point out this feature of herring 
ecology.  In 1992, the pollock fishing fleet 
observed herring migrating in the northern 
Aleutian Basin of the Bering Sea.  Herring 
schools withdrew from shelf by up to 60 – 100 
miles.  Observers reported herring catches of 36 t 
per trawl haul in the offshore.  This behaviour is 
also observed in the Atlantic–Scandianvian 
herring population, whose feeding area is chiefly 
situated above 1,000m depth.  Therefore, feeding 
migration route seems possible for herring in the 
Bering Sea offshore water. 
 
On the contrary, during the 1960s the Korf-
Karaginsky herring biomass reached 3.5 million 
t, twice the present level (Naumenko et al., 
1990). Based on the seasonal dynamics of herring 
daily diet value, annual Korf-Karaginsky 
population food ration totals at 24.3 million t (at 
level of herring biomass in 1.7 million tons).  It 
is noticeably lower than larger plankton 
production in shelf areas, which can be estimated 
at 63.9 million tons (from annual biomass 6.2 
million tons and P/B =10.3).  Last year’s euphau-
siid biomass increased in the herring feeding area 
and reached 309 mg •m
-3
.  Besides, the main part 
of larger zooplankton consumed by herring is 
likely transported from the offshore sea with the 
water flow onto the shelf.  Total annual eurypha-
gous zooplankton production was estimated at 
3.03 billion t for the whole Bering Sea, or 1,343 
t

 (Shuntov & Dulepova, 1995). 
 
During the 1990s, significant growth of the Korf-
Karaginsky herring biomass can be regarded as 
stable trend (Radchenko, 1998).  However, 
further increase of the Korf-Karaginsky herring 
population can be prevented by spawning and 
early development conditions (Puschaeva, 1969).  
Several small inlets in the northern Karaginsky 
and Korf Bays can be regarded as favourable for 
local herring reproduction.  Furthermore, natural 
mortality rates of egg and larvae sharply increase 
when spawning stocks are abundant (Puschaeva, 
1968; Kachina, 1981).  In last year, Dr. 
Naumenko (personal communication) has 
observed significant pre-spawning mortality of 
herring in the Anapka Inlet due to super-abundant 
herring spawner approach and inability to leave 
the inlet before reflux. 
 
Thereby, a herring feeding strategy involves 
consumption of abundant and less motile 
organisms.  During spring and summer feeding 
route herring aggregations are distributed in 
zones of permanent plankton transport and 
accumulation.  In early summer, copepods 
predominate among planktonic crustaceans in

related to euphausiids spawning, when 
euphausiids migrate into shallow areas and 
remain near the surface even during daytime 
(Ponomareva, 1990).  “Grazing” as feeding 
strategy is not inherent for herring in the same 
degree as for pollock.  This is indicated by the 
character of feeding migrations of these fish 
species:  dense, quickly moving schools for 
herring and dispersion from dense spawning 
aggregations for pollock.  
 
There are no “ecological limitations” (Blaber, 
1991) for herring to migrate into deeper water 
and feed upon offshore resources.  Nevertheless, 
herring ecology and feeding habits characterize 
this species as a typical shelf species.  At the 
present level of herring biomass, there is a 
remote possibility of abundant herring migrations 
in the offshore Bering Sea.  It means that the fish 
community in the deep-sea regions will have a 
predator deficit in its trophic structure.

Euphausiids are very important food resources 
for major fish resources, squid, mackerel, whales 
and so on in Korean waters. Euphausiids have 
recently shown an increasing trend in 
composition of major zooplankton groups, and 10 
species were identified from the Korean waters.  
Until recently, little work has been done in long-
term change in abundance of euphausiids in 
related to climate change and the importance of 
fish resources in the Korean waters.  This study 
is focus on general distributional pattern, the 
regional patterns of long-term changes in 
abundance and the relationship between 
euphausiid and fish abundance in Korean waters.

The National Fisheries Research and 
Development Institute has conducted regular 
oceanographic surveys 6 times annually 
(February, April, June, August, October and 
December) since 1965 in the Korean waters (Fig. 
1).  From this survey, euphausiids were collected 
by N ORPAC net (0.45 m mouth and 0.33 mm 
mesh size) with vertical tow from bottom (or 100 
m depth) to surface.  For this study, data on 
euphausiid abundance and surface water 
temperature during 1978-1998 were used.  
Catches of squid, mackerel and anchovy were 
analyzed during 1978-1998 in comparison with 
abundance of euphausiid.  
 
The following 10 species were identified from the 
Korean waters:  Euphausia recurva, E. mutica, 
E. pacifica, E. nana, E. tenera, E. similis, 
Pseudeuphausia latifrons, Stylocheiron affine, S. 
carinatum, and Thysanoessa longipes.  Of these 
species, E. pacifica, E. nana and P. latifrons 
were numerically dominant.  Seven other species 
were associated with the influx of the Tsushima 
Warm Current.  E. pacifica had a discontinuous 
distributional pattern.  It was found in the Sea of 
Japan and the northern part of the Korea Strait, 
and the Yellow Sea. E. nana occurred in the 
intervening area, with some overlap with E. 
pacifica in the east and west. 
 
From distribution of mean abundance of 
euphausiids during 1978-1998 in the Korean 
waters it is recognized that euphausiids were 
densely populated in the coastal area and the 
western area of Cheju Island in April and June.  
Although their abundance was very low, they 
usually aggregated in the coastal area in 
February, August and October. 
 
Comparing among three separated subareas, east, 
west and south areas, the south area showed the 
highest abundance, while the east area was low. 
 
There was a conspicuous seasonal change with 
the regional variation. In Korean waters a large 
peak appeared in spring, April and June, and a

.  The euphausiids showed an 
increasing trend since the early 1990s with two 
increasing periods (Fig. 2). The first occurred 
from the late 1970s to the early 1980s and the 
second occurred after 1990.  The increase after

euphausiid abundance.  Engraulis japonica and 
Scomber japonicus are major fish resources in the 
South Sea, while Todarodes pacificus is in the 
East Sea of Korea.  Engraulis japonica and 
Scomber japonicus began to increase since 1992 
with extraordinary increase in 1993 and 1996, 
respectively.  It did not coincide with euphausiid 
abundance, but there was a possibility that the 
increasing trend after 1990 in euphausiids 
abundance accompanied with increases of 
Engraulis japonica and Scomber japonicus after 
1992. 
 
Todarodes pacificus increased continuously after 
1990.  It was closely related to the increase of 
euphausiid abundance in the East Sea of Korea.

Introduction 
The euphausiids Euphausia pacifica and 
Thysanoessa spinifera dominate the euphausiid 
assemblage along the west coast of North 
America from Baja California to the Gulf of 
Alaska.  Research in the northeast Pacific has 
shown that the two species share a common 
latitudinal range but that T. spinifera is a coastal 
species, restricted to shelf waters while E. 
pacifica is an oceanic species.  For example, off 
southwestern Vancouver Island, Mackas (1992) 
showed that T. spinifera is the dominant 
euphausiid species in shelf waters and is the only 
euphausiid common in water depths shallower 
than about 150 m whereas E. pacifica is dominant 
along and seaward of the shelf break.  Off 
Newport, OR, Smiles and Pearcy (1971) found 
that Euphausia pacifica was far more abundant 
near the shelf-break than offshore, peaking at a 
station 25 miles from shore (250 m water depth).  
In the same data set, T. spinifera was found 
chiefly at a station 15 miles from shore (90 m 
water depth) but not farther offshore (Smiles, 
unpublished data).  Peterson and Miller (1976), 
who worked off Newport in 1971 and 1972, did 
not find E. pacifica closer to shore than 20 miles 
(150 m depth), nor T. spinifera further from 
shore than 20 miles.  Thus, off central Oregon 
the two species have their maxima in abundance 
at stations within a few miles of each other, with 
 
125 
small peak occurred in autumn, October.  In the 
south area this pattern is very clear, while in the 
west and east areas it was not clear.

Introduction 
The euphausiids Euphausia pacifica and 
Thysanoessa spinifera dominate the euphausiid 
assemblage along the west coast of North 
America from Baja California to the Gulf of 
Alaska.  Research in the northeast Pacific has 
shown that the two species share a common 
latitudinal range but that T. spinifera is a coastal 
species, restricted to shelf waters while E. 
pacifica is an oceanic species.  For example, off 
southwestern Vancouver Island, Mackas (1992) 
showed that T. spinifera is the dominant 
euphausiid species in shelf waters and is the only 
euphausiid common in water depths shallower 
than about 150 m whereas E. pacifica is dominant 
along and seaward of the shelf break.  Off 
Newport, OR, Smiles and Pearcy (1971) found 
that Euphausia pacifica was far more abundant 
near the shelf-break than offshore, peaking at a 
station 25 miles from shore (250 m water depth).  
In the same data set, T. spinifera was found 
chiefly at a station 15 miles from shore (90 m 
water depth) but not farther offshore (Smiles, 
unpublished data).  Peterson and Miller (1976), 
who worked off Newport in 1971 and 1972, did 
not find E. pacifica closer to shore than 20 miles 
(150 m depth), nor T. spinifera further from 
shore than 20 miles.  Thus, off central Oregon 
the two species have their maxima in abundance 
at stations within a few miles of each other, with 
 
126 
little or no overlap in their zonal distributions, 
but how they are maintained in separate 
ecological zones remains a puzzle.  The two 
species do co-occur in Barkley Sound, a deep 
fjord that penetrates southwest Vancouver Island 
(Tanasichuk, 1998a, b).  Curiously, in Puget 
Sound, Dabob Bay, Saanich Inlet and the Straits 
of Georgia only Euphausia pacifica is present 
(and abundant) whereas Thysanoessa spinifera is 
either uncommon or absent (Ross et al. 1982; 
Bollens et al. 1992). 
 
The patterns observed off the Oregon coast are 
not as clear-cut in California waters. CalCOFI 
Atlas No. 5 shows that T. spinifera inhabit both 
shelf and oceanic waters off northern and central 
California (Brinton 1967); E. pacifica is chiefly 
an offshore species but has a biomass maxima at 
the shelf break (Brinton 1962).  T. spinifera has 
been found far to sea off northern and central 
California when associated with mesoscale 
eddies, filaments and jets -- Mackas et al. (1991) 
reported high concentration of this species along 
the shoreward edge of an upwelling filament.  
Also, Peterson (unpublished data from a survey 
of the jet/eddy complex off Monterey, July 1991) 
found large concentrations of T. spinifera (40-150 
juveniles + adults m
-3
 ) in the cool waters of an 
upwelling filament, 120 miles from shore.  On 
the other hand, Huntley et al. (1995) did not 
report the presence of T. spinifera in their survey 
of a large eddy off Monterey in June 1993.  
Mackas et al., Huntley et al. and Peterson all 
found enhanced concentrations of E. pacifica 
within these mesoscale features.  Based o n 
analysis of acoustics data, Swartzman (personal 
communication) found that the pronounced 
zonation patterns observed off central Oregon 
begin to break down south of Cape Blanco. 
 
We have been sampling euphausiid larvae in the 
coastal zone off Newport, OR during biweekly 
cruises since 1996 at stations 5 and 15 miles from 
shore (9 and 28 km respectively).  Thysanoessa 
spinifera larvae were always most abundant at the 
nearshore station whereas Euphausia pacifica 
were usually most abundant at the offshore 
station.  Table 1 compares the densities at each 
station, where we show data averaged over the 
growth season of March of one year to February 
of the next (following Tanasichuk 1998).   
During the 1997-98 El Niño, both species had 
their highest overall abundances, probably due to 
strong onshore advection during this period.  
With the onset of the 1999-00 La Niña (a period 
of cool water and high upwelling), densities of 
Euphausia pacifica declined markdly (possibly 
due to transport offshore). 
 
We also compared our larval density numbers to 
those from a similar study conducted about 300 
miles to the north of Newport, Oregon, in 
Barkley Sound, Vancouver Island, British 
Columbia, by Tanasichuk (1998a,b).  Large 
differences in larval densities are seen, with 
Barkley Sound densities up to 10 fold greater than 
off Newport (Table 2).  However, the ratio of 
densities of the two species (density of E. pacifica 
divided by density of T. spinifera) was very 
similar when NH 5 is compared to Barkeley 
Sound (but not NH 15), suggesting that despite 
differences in production, Barkeley Sound 
resembles our nearshore station but not our 
offshore station. 
 
Some very unusual euphausiid species were found 
off Oregon during the El Niño, Euphausia 
recurva and E. mutica.  These two species a re 
ordinarily found only in Pacific Central water but 
occurred shelf waters off Oregon during winter 
1997-98.  This is the first record of these species 
off Oregon.  Another unusual species was 
Nyctiphanes simplex, a coastal species that is 
normally most common off Baja California and in 
the southern California Bight (Brinton 1962, 
1967).  The meaning of this is that northward 
transport of coastal water carried N. simplex to 
Oregon (as noted previously by Brodeur et al. 
1985.  To account for the occurrence of E. 
recurva and E. mutica, there must also have been 
some northward and onshore transport of surface 
waters from the Central Gyre, due to intense 
southwesterly storms in winter 1997/98.

the other hand, Huntley et al. (1995) did not 
report the presence of T. spinifera in their survey 
of a large eddy off Monterey in June 1993.  
Mackas et al., Huntley et al. and Peterson all 
found enhanced concentrations of E. pacifica 
within these mesoscale features.  Based o n 
analysis of acoustics data, Swartzman (personal 
communication) found that the pronounced 
zonation patterns observed off central Oregon 
begin to break down south of Cape Blanco. 
 
We have been sampling euphausiid larvae in the 
coastal zone off Newport, OR during biweekly 
cruises since 1996 at stations 5 and 15 miles from 
shore (9 and 28 km respectively).  Thysanoessa 
spinifera larvae were always most abundant at the 
nearshore station whereas Euphausia pacifica 
were usually most abundant at the offshore 
station.  Table 1 compares the densities at each 
station, where we show data averaged over the 
growth season of March of one year to February 
of the next (following Tanasichuk 1998).   
During the 1997-98 El Niño, both species had 
their highest overall abundances, probably due to 
strong onshore advection during this period.  
With the onset of the 1999-00 La Niña (a period 
of cool water and high upwelling), densities of 
Euphausia pacifica declined markdly (possibly 
due to transport offshore). 
 
We also compared our larval density numbers to 
those from a similar study conducted about 300 
miles to the north of Newport, Oregon, in 
Barkley Sound, Vancouver Island, British 
Columbia, by Tanasichuk (1998a,b).  Large 
differences in larval densities are seen, with 
Barkley Sound densities up to 10 fold greater than 
off Newport (Table 2).  However, the ratio of 
densities of the two species (density of E. pacifica 
divided by density of T. spinifera) was very 
similar when NH 5 is compared to Barkeley 
Sound (but not NH 15), suggesting that despite 
differences in production, Barkeley Sound 
resembles our nearshore station but not our 
offshore station. 
 
Some very unusual euphausiid species were found 
off Oregon during the El Niño, Euphausia 
recurva and E. mutica.  These two species a re 
ordinarily found only in Pacific Central water but 
occurred shelf waters off Oregon during winter 
1997-98.  This is the first record of these species 
off Oregon.  Another unusual species was 
Nyctiphanes simplex, a coastal species that is 
normally most common off Baja California and in 
the southern California Bight (Brinton 1962, 
1967).  The meaning of this is that northward 
transport of coastal water carried N. simplex to 
Oregon (as noted previously by Brodeur et al. 
1985.  To account for the occurrence of E. 
recurva and E. mutica, there must also have been 
some northward and onshore transport of surface 
waters from the Central Gyre, due to intense 
southwesterly storms in winter 1997/98.

Summary 
The intent of this field work was to p rovide 
empirical evidence in observed larval 
distributions, stage-structure, and inferred 
developmental pathways of whether the 
developmental regime affects the development 
and abundance of particularly elastic larval 
stages.  Armed with the insights from life-history 
modelling and demographic analyses (Rumsey 
and Franks, 1999), I sought to address particular 
aspects of the Euphausia pacifica life-history.  
First, how are the larval stages distributed 
vertically in the field with respect to each other 
and the developmental environment?  Second, as 
indicated by the vertical distribution of calyptopis 
I stage larvae, is there evidence that females 
restrict the depth-range of spawning to enhance 
the profitability of the initial developmental 
environment?  Third, I investigated whether there 
was variability in furcilia I -II developmental 
pathways over short (mesoscale) spatial scales, 
and if found, with what oceanographic conditions 
particular pathways are associated.  Fourth, I 
described the spatial variability of larval stage-
frequency distributions, and the environmental 
conditions and/or developmental processes with 
which such variability was associated. 
 
 
 
Oceanographic and Demographic Data 
Two cruises were conducted in the Southern 
California Bight, south of the Santa Barbara 
Channel and Channel Islands, in the winters of 
1996 (cruise S9602) and 1997 (J9701).  Samples 
of Euphausia pacifica larvae were obtained by 
MOCNESS transects across mesoscale 
oceanographic features (Fig. 1).  CTD-
fluorometer profiles accompanied each station 
(Fig. 2).  E. pacifica larvae were identified to 
stage using morphological criteria (Boden, 1955).  
The developmental instar of pleopod development 
was noted for furcilia I -II stage larvae, and the 
dominant furcilia I -II pleopod developmental 
pathways determined for each station (after 
Knight, 1984; Lavaniegos-Espejo, 1994).  
 
Spawning Distribution 
Despite differences in the vertical distribution of 
E. pacifica larval stages between cruises, the 
majority (>95%) of larval stages were found in 
the upper 100 m (Fig. 3 ).  Eggs were not 
sampled during either cruise, nonetheless, the 
presence/absence of the initial larval stages (being 
weakly swimming, e.g. calyptopis I) with depth 
is indicative of the depth range of spawning by 
gravid females.  Although the vertical distribution 
of post-larvae in the night-time samples of both 
cruises was predominantly in the upper 150 m, 
their daily ambit spanned 0 -300 m depth

Oceanographic and Demographic Data 
Two cruises were conducted in the Southern 
California Bight, south of the Santa Barbara 
Channel and Channel Islands, in the winters of 
1996 (cruise S9602) and 1997 (J9701).  Samples 
of Euphausia pacifica larvae were obtained by 
MOCNESS transects across mesoscale 
oceanographic features (Fig. 1).  CTD-
fluorometer profiles accompanied each station 
(Fig. 2).  E. pacifica larvae were identified to 
stage using morphological criteria (Boden, 1955).  
The developmental instar of pleopod development 
was noted for furcilia I -II stage larvae, and the 
dominant furcilia I -II pleopod developmental 
pathways determined for each station (after 
Knight, 1984; Lavaniegos-Espejo, 1994).  
 
Spawning Distribution 
Despite differences in the vertical distribution of 
E. pacifica larval stages between cruises, the 
majority (>95%) of larval stages were found in 
the upper 100 m (Fig. 3 ).  Eggs were not 
sampled during either cruise, nonetheless, the 
presence/absence of the initial larval stages (being 
weakly swimming, e.g. calyptopis I) with depth 
is indicative of the depth range of spawning by 
gravid females.  Although the vertical distribution 
of post-larvae in the night-time samples of both 
cruises was predominantly in the upper 150 m, 
their daily ambit spanned 0 -300 m depth 
 
129 
(observed in J9701 day samples; Mauchline and 
Fisher, 1969; Brinton, 1976).  The distribution of 
CI larvae is evidence that the depth range of egg 
release by E. pacifica is restricted relative to that 
of gravid females.  Restricting the depth range of 
egg release to < 100 m would ensure warmer 
temperatures (and thus shorter developmental 
times) as well as enhanced availability of 
phytoplankton-food for first-feeding larvae.  
 
Furcilia I-II Developmental Pathways 
Prolonged developmental times, associated with 
indirect furcilia I -II pleopod developmental 
pathways, represent morphogenic plasticity that is 
likely an adaptive trait in neritic euphausiids 
inhabiting inherently variable environments.  A 
predominance of indirect pleopod developmental 
pathways was associated only with the “cool” 
stations of cruise J9701 (Fig. 4).  The proximate 
developmental temperatures for these larvae were 
1-3 °C cooler (0-100 m) relative to temperature 
profiles for the other J9701 stations and the 
S9602 stations (Fig. 2).  Furcilia I -II develop-
mental pathways were predominantly direct at all 
S9602 stations (Fig. 4), and the cyclonic eddy 
with which they were associated was a persistent 
feature, comparable to the time scale of E. 
pacifica larval development.  It is surprising, 
given the comparatively low chlorophyll 
conditions for cruise S9602 (Fig. 2), that furcilia 
development was so direct.  Despite > 4 -fold 
difference in chlorophyll fluorescence between 
cruises (Fig. 2) the proportion of S9602 indirect 
developmental pathways was indistinguishable 
from the J9701 “warm” stations, suggesting that 
temperature regime has a greater impact on early 
furcilia development than does ambient 
chlorophyll. 
 
Winter and spring euphausiid abundances ( E. 
pacifica included) have increased over the last 40 
years in the Southern California Bight (Brinton, 
1996), concurrent with a 1.5°C increase in 
surface temperatures and an 80% decrease in 
overall macrozooplankton biomass (Roemmich 
and McGowan, 1995).  In contrast to overall 
macrozooplankton, one might expect diminished 
euphausiid recruitment success and indirect 
developmental pathways to be correlated with 
cooler developmental temperatures.  The results 
of elasticity analyses (Rumsey and Franks, 1999) 
and the association of indirect furcilia I -II 
developmental pathways with cooler temperatures 
during cruise J9701 are in accordance with this 
notion.  Observations of direct furcilia develop-
ment associated with locally cooler temperatures 
over a broad geographic range (Puget Sound, 
Ross et al., 1982; Baja California, Lavaniegos, 
1994; Southern California Bight, Knight, 1984), 
however, are difficult to reconcile with the 
observations of cruise J9701 and Brinton (1996).  
Furthermore, it is difficult to reconcile the 
impaired development observed in association 
with 10-12 °C conditions given that viable 
populations farther north in E. pacifica’s range 
certainly endure much colder developmental 
temperatures yet are not necessarily characterized 
by indirect furcilia development and diminished 
recruitment success.  The response and tolerance 
of larval development to temperature 
heterogeneity may be determined by the 
temperature conditions during oogenesis and/or at 
egg release.  Thus, variability in E. pacifica 
larval development may be in response to 
temperature anomalies rather than absolute 
conditions.  Alternatively, the inconsistent 
relationship between development and 
temperature among regional populations could 
result from different physiological “races”, each 
adapted to a distinct temperature range. 
 
Larval Stage-Frequency Distributions 
The high proportion of calyptopis I (CI) larvae in 
the stage-frequency distributions of cruise S9602 
(Fig. 5A), suggest that spawning was ongoing or 
had only recently ceased.  The greater proportion 
of CI larvae at the “green” stations may reflect 
differences in recent egg release or differences in 
egg t hrough CI mortality among stations.  
Although small-scale (~1 km) differences in egg-
inputs remains a possible contributing factor, 
associated differences among stations in 
chlorophyll conditions suggest the importance of 
differences in CI mortality.  The CI stage is the 
first-feeding euphausiid larval stage.  Several 
investigators have asserted that mortality during 
the CI stage is especially sensitive to 
environmental conditions (Brinton, 1976; Ross et 
 
129 
(observed in J9701 day samples; Mauchline and 
Fisher, 1969; Brinton, 1976).  The distribution of 
CI larvae is evidence that the depth range of egg 
release by E. pacifica is restricted relative to that 
of gravid females.  Restricting the depth range of 
egg release to < 100 m would ensure warmer 
temperatures (and thus shorter developmental 
times) as well as enhanced availability of 
phytoplankton-food for first-feeding larvae.  
 
Furcilia I-II Developmental Pathways 
Prolonged developmental times, associated with 
indirect furcilia I -II pleopod developmental 
pathways, represent morphogenic plasticity that is 
likely an adaptive trait in neritic euphausiids 
inhabiting inherently variable environments.  A 
predominance of indirect pleopod developmental 
pathways was associated only with the “cool” 
stations of cruise J9701 (Fig. 4).  The proximate 
developmental temperatures for these larvae were 
1-3 °C cooler (0-100 m) relative to temperature 
profiles for the other J9701 stations and the 
S9602 stations (Fig. 2).  Furcilia I -II develop-
mental pathways were predominantly direct at all 
S9602 stations (Fig. 4), and the cyclonic eddy 
with which they were associated was a persistent 
feature, comparable to the time scale of E.

ment associated with locally cooler temperatures

Larval Stage-Frequency Distributions 
The high proportion of calyptopis I (CI) larvae in 
the stage-frequency distributions of cruise S9602 
(Fig. 5A), suggest that spawning was ongoing or 
had only recently ceased.  The greater proportion 
of CI larvae at the “green” stations may reflect 
differences in recent egg release or differences in 
egg t hrough CI mortality among stations.  
Although small-scale (~1 km) differences in egg-
inputs remains a possible contributing factor, 
associated differences among stations in 
chlorophyll conditions suggest the importance of 
differences in CI mortality.  The CI stage is the 
first-feeding euphausiid larval stage.  Several 
investigators have asserted that mortality during 
the CI stage is especially sensitive to 
environmental conditions (Brinton, 1976; Ross et 
 
130 
al., 1988; Paul et al., 1990), in particularly 
conditions of food-availability (Hofmann et al., 
1992).  The greater proportion of CI larvae at the 
green stations, with significantly greater 
chlorophyll (0-25 m), may reflect lower mortality 
at these stations due to more favorable food 
conditions.  Additionally, the proportion of post-
larvae (predominantly juveniles and non-mature 
adults) present at the green stations was greater 
than at those stations with lower surface 
chlorophyll.  The proportion of post-larvae at a 
given station provides a rough index of local 
recruitment success (as most of the post-larvae 
sampled were juveniles, presumably having 
recently completed larval development).  
Although the chlorophyll regime appeared to 
have little impact on observed furcilia 
development (previous section), food availability 
during early larval development in E. pacifica 
may affect CI survivorship and subsequent larval 
recruitment.  Lavaniegos-Espejo (1992) found 
that laboratory survivorship of N. simplex larvae 
was most affected by state of calyptopis 
development at the time of collection.  The 
increased survivorship of larvae that started out 
as CIII vs. CII larvae in her experiments suggests 
that the food history of calyptopis phase larvae 
can impact the survivorship of later stages. 
 
Differences in larval stage-frequencies during 
cruise J9701 (Fig. 5B) were driven mostly by 
variability in the proportion of the later furcilia 
stages (furcilia III-VI). FIII-FVI larvae at the 
“warm” stations exhibited direct pathways of 
pleopod development, relative to the cooler 
stations.  Accelerated FIII-FVI developmental 
times associated with warmer temperatures could 
result in earlier recruitment and result in fewer 
larvae of these stages sampled.  The higher 
proportion of post-larvae associated with the 
warm stations further s upports this notion of 
earlier recruitment.

Inverse modelling of developmental parameters in Euphausia pacifica:  The relative 
importance of spawning history and environmental forcing to larval stage-frequency 
distributions

Factors potentially influencing zooplankton larval 
population dynamics and recruitment include 
advection, larval processes, biotic interactions 
(predation, competition, etc.), and spatial-
temporal variability in the magnitude of egg 
release (Fig. 1).  Research has shown that 
oceanographic conditions can impact larval 
developmental pathways and demography in 
Euphausia pacifica, thus contributing to 
variability in recruitment (Brinton, 1976; Knight, 
1984).  The focus of this paper is to evaluate 
variability in E. pacifica larval stage-frequency 
distributions observed during two cruises in the 
Southern California Bight.  Relative comparisons 
of back-calculated (inverse modelled) stage-
specific vital parameters (stage duration and 
specific mortality) and histories of egg input were 
conducted.  The results of the model, in the 
context of the sampled oceanographic 
environment and observed larval developmental 
pathways, were evaluated to determine the 
relative importance of variability in 
developmental and specific mortality rates vs. 
egg-input variability at different scales (within 
cruises and between cruises). 
 
Within-Cruise Comparisons 
Within-year, among-station, differences in stage-
frequency structure are more likely associated 
with developmental loss (variability in stage 
duration or specific mortality) than with 
variability in egg input.  Although the larval 
demography for cruise S9602 generally reflects 
sampling during the crescendo of a spawning 
pulse, and that for J 9701 suggests sampling 
toward the end of a pulse (Fig. 2A and 3A, 
respectively), it is unlikely that differences among 
stations were forced by spatial variability in 
spawning histories.  Back-calculated solutions of 
S9602 relative egg-input indicate that if station 
differences in larval stage-frequencies was driven 
by egg-input alone, as much as a 2000% 
fluctuation in egg-input among stations is 
required (Fig. 2B).  Variability to such an extent 
exceeds that observed by Brinton (1976) even 
between peak-spawning and background-
spawning winter months (approximately 
<500%).  The differences in relative egg input 
calculated for J9701 (Fig. 3B) is considerably less 
than the S9602 solutions, but egg inputs for the 
“warm” stations would have to have been more 
than twice those of the cool stations for stages CI-
FII (a period representing about a month and 
approximately 50% of the total larval 
developmental time at ambient temperatures; 
Ross, 1981).  Such extreme differences in the 
magnitude of egg release during a spawning peak, 
persisting over 1 km spatial scales (station 
spacing for S9602) and month time scales, is 
unlikely. 
 
Due to the exponential nature of larval mortality 
in the model, the difference in stage duration or 
specific mortality necessary to explain observed 
station larval demographics is considerably less 
than that for egg inputs.  The back-calculated 
solutions of relative developmental loss (stage 
duration and specific mortality) for the “blue” 
S9602 stations were more positive than those for 
the higher chlorophyll “green” stations (Fig. 2C). 
 
The necessary differences in back-calculated 
stage duration or specific mortality necessary to 
explain among-station differences in larval stage-
frequencies was considerably less than the egg 
input solutions for the J9701 station groups as 
well (Fig. 3C).  The back-calculated 
developmental parameters for the “cool” J9701

demography for cruise S9602 generally reflects

toward the end of a pulse (Fig. 2A and 3A,

S9602 relative egg-input indicate that if station 
differences in larval stage-frequencies was driven 
by egg-input alone, as much as a 2000%

required (Fig. 2B).  Variability to such an extent 
exceeds that observed by Brinton (1976) even 
between peak-spawning and background-

calculated for J9701 (Fig. 3B) is considerably less

magnitude of egg release during a spawning peak, 
persisting over 1 km spatial scales (station 
spacing for S9602) and month time scales, is 
unlikely. 
 
Due to the exponential nature of larval mortality 
in the model, the difference in stage duration or 
specific mortality necessary to explain observed 
station larval demographics is considerably less 
than that for egg inputs.  The back-calculated 
solutions of relative developmental loss (stage 
duration and specific mortality) for the “blue” 
S9602 stations were more positive than those for 
the higher chlorophyll “green” stations (Fig. 2C). 
 
The necessary differences in back-calculated 
stage duration or specific mortality necessary to 
explain among-station differences in larval stage-
frequencies was considerably less than the egg 
input solutions for the J9701 station groups as 
well (Fig. 3C).  The back-calculated 
developmental parameters for the “cool” J9701 
 
134 
stations were more positive than the “warm” 
station solutions for stages CI-FII.  The elevated 
mortality (approximately 10-50%) for these 
stages at the cool stations is consistent with 
prolonged developmental times associated with 
the 1-3°C cooler temperatures.  
 
Between-Cruise Comparisons 
A peak in winter spawning activity in the 
Southern California Bight typically occurs during 
the months of January-February (Brinton, 1976), 
however, between-cruise comparison of back-
calculated egg inputs (Fig. 4B) suggests that the 
cruise stage-frequencies (Fig. 4A) reflect 
sampling at different times during a spawning 
pulse.  Cruise S9602 appears to have sampled 
toward the peak of a “normal” January-February 
spawning pulse, while J9701 indicates sampling 
when the magnitude of spawning activity had 
diminished.  Alternatively, the predominance of 
younger larvae in the stage-structures of the 
S9602 stage-frequencies could be the result of 
elevated mortality in the later larval stages 
relative to J9701 (Fig. 4C).  Such an increase in 
mortality might be attributable to increased stage 
durations or specific mortalities, however, an 
elevated developmental loss during S9602 
contradicts observed temperature-chlorophyll 
conditions and larval developmental pathways.  It 
is more likely that between-cruise differences in 
larval age-structure were driven by different 
histories of egg input than by differences in 
developmental parameters.   
 
Application of a simple inverse model, and some 
significant assumptions, has allowed me to 
evaluate the impact of variability in 
developmental and specific mortality rates in 
relation to variability in spawning histories in 
forcing observed differences in larval stage-
frequency distributions.  A more rigorous 
comparison of these factors would require an 
abundance of shiptime and ancillary larval rearing 
data at prohibitive cost and effort.  Ideally one 
would obtain a time series of egg release prior to 
the Lagrangian sampling of the larval population, 
requiring approximately 145 days of ship time 
(i.e. twice the duration of larval development).  
Additionally, shipboard observations of stage 
durations and specific-mortalities at ambient 
temperature/food conditions, in concert with a 
time series of stage-frequency curves, would 
afford the application of more quantitative 
techniques of estimating stage-specific mortality 
rates.  The inverse method used, the set of 
assumptions applied, and the relative comparisons 
of parameters conducted has afforded the 
opportunity to address hypotheses that otherwise 
could only be considered by a large-scale 
research program.

An ecosystem model with zooplankton vertical migration focused on Oyashio region

An ecosystem model with eight compartments 
(Fig. 1) was developed in order to describe a 
Northern Pacific primary and secondary 
production.  This model was made by the request 
of PICES GLOBEC CCCC Program.  Model 
equations describe the interactions of nitrate, 
ammonium, two phytoplankton size fractions 
(tentatively, these are diatom and dinoflagellate), 
two zooplankton size  fractions (tentatively, 
copepod and microzooplankton), PON, and 
DON.  Formulations for the biological processes 
are based primarily upon KKYS(Kawamiya et al., 
1996, 1997).  One dimensional physical-
biological coupled model including mixed layer 
closure model is used to simulate time dependent 
features of ecosystem off Sanriku district(Fig. 2).  
Time series of nutrient and plankton distributions 
obtained from Hokkaido National Institute of 
Fisheries provide verification of model results.  
The simulated results were well reproduced the 
seasonal and interannual change of ecosystems 
there.  Model simulations indicate that vertical 
migration of copepod is a potentially important 
factor in determining the trophic structure in the 
change of phytoplankton species during spring 
bloom.

Figure 3 shows in case without vertical migration 
of copepod.  This only shows the spring bloom of 
small zooplankton (ZS) which causes consequent 
large zooplankton increase.  However as shown 
in Figure 4, in case with vertical migration of 
copepods (ZL), in spring large phytoplankton 
(PL) makes first bloom because small 
phytoplankton (PS) cannot increase by grazing 
pressure of small zooplankton and after large 
zooplankton (ZL) migrate to shallower region 
small zooplankton decrease by grazing of large 
one which causes increase of small phytoplankton 
bloom following large one.
