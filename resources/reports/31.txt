Foreword 
Over twenty years ago, John Martin, Director of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratory, California State 
University, began putting evidence together from studies in the 1930s to propose that phytoplankton were 
limited by the availability of iron in some areas of the ocean.  These regions were termed high-nutrient 
low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions.  Today, we know that the subarctic Pacific, equatorial Pacific, and the 
Southern Ocean are the three major HNLC regions of the world.  Since Martin put forth his hypothesis, iron 
fertilization of HNLC water has been thought to be one possible approach to remove CO
2
 from the 
atmosphere to combat global warming caused by greenhouse gases.  Natural iron fertilization has also been 
hypothesized to control the glacial/interglacial shift in atmospheric CO
2
.   
 
The subarctic Pacific is characterized by a shallow (100–200 m) permanent pycnocline during winter, 
permitting relatively high numbers of phytoplankton and micro-grazers to subsist over winter.  This, in turn, 
strongly influences the pelagic community structure.  Two gyres, the Alaska Gyre (also called the Eastern 
Subarctic Gyre; both names used interchangeably in this report) and the Western Subarctic Gyre, dominate 
the subarctic Pacific.  In the Alaska Gyre, Ocean Station Papa has produced a 50-year time series of 
physical, chemical and biological parameters, and has been the focus of three intensive sampling programs, 
the SUbarctic Pacific Ecosystem Research Project (SUPER), the World Ocean Circulation Experiment 
(WOCE) and Canadian Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (CJGOFS).  In the Western Subarctic Gyre, the 
establishment of the time series station KNOT in 1998 has produced much data collected for understanding 
the seasonality of various parameters in this area. 
 
In these two gyres, we now know that iron limits the utilization of nitrate and hence, the primary 
productivity of large cells, such as diatoms, except in the winter when iron and light may be co-limiting.  In 
the Western Subarctic Gyre, which is in closer proximity to the Asia than the Alaska Gyre, the degree of 
iron limitation changes in parallel with the dust season in Asia.  In fact, measured iron concentrations in the 
surface and deep waters seem to be higher in the Western Subarctic Gyre compared to the Alaska Gyre.  
Bottle incubation experiments have demonstrated that iron addition results in the increase in pennate 
diatoms in the Alaska Gyre and the increase in centric diatoms in the Western Subarctic Gyre.  Such 
differences between these two gyres may also have an influence on the pelagic community structure and 
export production.   
 
To test the iron limitation hypothesis of phytoplankton production in nutrient-rich areas of the open sea, 
iron fertilization experiments were first conducted in the equatorial Pacific under the programs IronEx I and 
II in the early and mid 1990s.  These mesoscale enrichments experiments offered the chance to test the 
whole ecosystem response, and the results showed that iron supply controls phytoplankton processes, 
leading to enhanced phytoplankton stocks and associated macronutrient uptake and CO
2
 drawdown.  
Another iron fertilization experiment soon followed in the Southern Ocean (SOIREE, Southern Ocean Iron 
RElease Experiment) during the summer season of 1999 and again demonstrated that iron supply controls 
phytoplankton growth and community composition, but the fate of produced organic carbon remains 
unknown. 
 
The subarctic Pacific, with a unique water structure and biology, was the only HNLC region without an iron 
fertilization experiment to assess the iron hypothesis.  Key questions that were not entirely resolved by the 
previous iron enrichment experiments, were: 
  
1. How does the change in biodiversity and food-web structure differ for markedly different HNLC 
ecosystems which have been perturbed by an iron addition?  
2. What is the drawdown of CO
2
 
and, especially, the flux of carbon to the deep ocean?  
3. How does the production of ligands influence the iron chemistry and the longevity of the phytoplankton 
bloom?  
4. How does zooplankton grazing influence the formation of the bloom and the carbon flux (e.g., fecal 
pellet production)?  
vi 
5. What is the long term response and recovery of the ecosystem following an iron addition?  
6. What is the magnitude of production of other climate change gases, such as dimethyl sulphide (DMS) 
during the bloom, and how is the production influenced by phytoplankton species, microbial processes 
and grazing? 
 
The proposal to establish an Advisory Panel on Iron Fertilization Experiment in the subarctic Pacific 
Ocean (IFEP-AP), under the BASS (BASin Studies) Task Team of the PICES Climate Change and 
Carrying Capacity (CCCC) Program, was approved at PICES VII in 1998, in Fairbanks, U.S.A.  Working 
by correspondence, the Advisory Panel developed a workplan to tackle the following tasks:  (1) to draw on 
the results of IronEx I, II and SOIREE to design a subarctic experiment and to come up with an hypothesis 
not answered in previous works;  (2) to campaign for resources, particularly ship time required for 
successful experiments;  and (3) to create an infra-structure for interaction, data distribution and publication, 
and scheduling for the participants.   
 
A first IFEP-AP meeting was held at PICES VIII in October 1999, in Vladivostok, Russia.  Here, the 
Advisory Panel (i) examined the reasoning for a subarctic iron experiment, the scale disciplines, and 
resources required to ensure success of the experiment, and (ii) produced a preliminary design of the 
experiment and its timing.  The Panel provided an important co-ordination mechanism for international 
planning of meso-scale iron fertilization experiments conducted for the first time in the HNLC waters in the 
subarctic Pacific Ocean.   
 
Japan organized the first of a series of experiments in the northwestern Pacific, SEEDS-I (Subarctic Pacific 
Iron Experiment for Ecosystem Dynamics Study), in the summer of 2001, followed by the Canadian 
SERIES (Subarctic Ecosystem Response of Iron Enrichment Study) in the summer of 2002, in the 
northeastern Pacific, and the Japanese SEEDS-II in the summer of 2004, again, in the northwestern Pacific.  
The Panel also convened a series of international workshops (in October 2000 in Tsukuba, Japan, and in 
February 2004, in Victoria, Canada) so that international scientists engaging in iron fertilization 
experiments (e.g., IronEx I, IronEx II in the equatorial Pacific, SOIREE in the subantarctic Pacific, and 
SOFeX in the Antarctic waters) could gather to share their experiences and exciting new findings, which 
came out as PICES literature as well as in publications in Nature, Science, and other professional journals.  
The Panel has served as a roadmap for the science of iron fertilization as a new tool for process research, 
and will point the way to future achievements. 
 
This scientific report contains 13 extended abstracts by 25 participants from 3 countries involved in a 
PICES-sponsored workshop on “In situ iron enrichment experiments in the eastern and western subarctic 
Pacific”, held February 11–13, 2004, in Victoria, Canada, which compares iron fertilization experiment 
results between the western and eastern subarctic Pacific.  We have also provided background information 
that will enable the reader to refer to items and events related to this workshop.  Appendix 1 includes the 
proceedings of the initial planning workshop on “Designing the iron fertilization experiment in the 
subarctic Pacific”, held October 19–20, 2000, in Tsukuba, Japan, and co-sponsored by PICES and the Japan 
Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI).  This workshop resulted in a spirited 
discussion among 39 participants from 5 countries and the submission of the extended abstracts from the 19 
presentations.  Appendix 2 is an historical list of all members of the Advisory Panel from 1999 to the 
present.  Appendix 3 contains the IFEP-AP terms of reference, approved in 1999, and amended in 2004 to 
include a fourth term in response to the unexpected outcomes of the three iron enrichment experiments 
(SEEDS-I, 2001; SERIES, 2002, and SEEDS-II, 2004).  Appendix 4 is comprised of the IFEP-AP Annual 
Reports, from its inception to 2004.  The last Appendix contains featured articles on the iron enrichment 
experiments in the subarctic Pacific Ocean taken from the 2002 and 2004 issues of the PICES Press

1 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES 
Iron deficiency has been proposed as the reason for 
the existence of surface waters rich in 
macronutrients but low in phytoplankton biomass 
in the subarctic Pacific, the equatorial Pacific and 
the Southern Ocean.  In the summer of 2001, an 
iron enrichment experiment, the Subarctic Pacific 
Iron Experiment for Ecosystem Dynamics Study 
(SEEDS-I), was performed in the western subarctic 
Pacific; in the summer of 2002, another iron 
enrichment experiment, the Subarctic Ecosystem 
Response to Iron Enrichment Study  (SERIES), 
was carried out in the eastern subarctic Pacific 
(Fig. 1).  These international collaborative projects 
between Canada and Japan were conceived at the 
first planning workshop of the PICES Advisory 
Panel on Iron Fertilization Experiment in the 
subarctic Pacific Ocean (IFEP), held in Tsukuba, 
Japan, in 2000, in conjunction with PICES IX (see 
Appendix 1 for details). 
 
In order to review the results and outstanding 
questions from these experiments, and to discuss 
plans for a second, longer-term experiment in the 
western subarctic Pacific (SEEDS-II), a Workshop 
on “In situ iron enrichment experiments in the 
eastern and western subarctic Pacific” was held 
February 11–13, 2004, at the Chateau Victoria 
Hotel, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.  
Twenty-six scientists from Canada, Japan, the 
United States of America, and the PICES 
Secretariat, attended the workshop. 
 
The objectives of the workshop were to: 
 
• Synthesize results from the two in situ iron 
enrichment experiments performed in the 
eastern and western subarctic Pacific (SEEDS-I 
and SERIES); 
• Discuss responses to iron additions in lower and 
higher trophic levels, carbon cycles, trace-gas 
production and ocean–atmosphere flux, and 
models; 
• Determine similarities and differences in 
biogeochemical and ecosystem responses to 
iron addition between the eastern and western 
subarctic Pacific; 
• Identify specific scientific questions for the new 
longer-term experiment in the western subarctic 
Pacific (SEEDS-II).

2 2004 WORKSHOP SUMMARY  
 
2.1 What have we learned from the enrichment experiments? 
 
 
Fate of carbon 
 
SEEDS-I 
• There was no significant increase in export flux 
(13%), and the major part (75%) of the fixed 
carbon stayed in the surface; 
• A significant portion of the organic carbon 
production was observed as dissolved organic 
carbon (DOC); 
• Good agreement was found in DOC/Chl-a 
production ratio between SEEDS and SERIES; 
• Transparent exopolymer particle (TEP) 
concentrations were low compared to 
phytoplankton standing stocks, presumably 
because TEP production by the dominant 
oceanic diatoms is low. 
 
 
SERIES 
• Eddies were an important influence on patch 
behaviour; drifter tracks tended to slip eastward 
relative to patch centres by wind stress; 
• Intercalibration and sampling coverage between 
ships was good; 
• Bloom evolution was captured in detail; 
• Bloom decline – 80% of the particulate organic 
carbon (POC), fixed following iron enrichment, 
was no longer in the mixed layer by Day 25; 
• Budgets could account for up to 70% of this 
POC (but using indirect methods) and 80% in N; 
• Nanophytoplankton caused high particulate 
carbon on Days 7–10 of the bloom; 
• What occurred after Day 20 to bring salt, NO
3
, 
Si[OH]
4
 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) 
into the base of the patch? Is the simultaneous 
crash of the bloom a coincidence?  
• What is the source of the high CaCO
3
 fluxes to 
sediment traps? 
• Between 50 and 125 m, biogenic silica 
dissolution was faster than organic matter decay. 
Can we believe this? Historical sediment trap 
and nutrient data suggest yes. 
• Had bloom export terminated? 
• An increase in DOC was not clear during the 
stationary and decline phases.  
Ecosystem responses 
 
SEEDS-I 
• There were increases in Chl-a concentrations  
(× 26) and rate of primary production (× 13); 
• A floristic shift to large cells (centric diatoms) 
was observed; 
• Coastal diatoms responded quickly to the iron 
enrichment and built up a large biomass.  So the 
presence of these coastal species as resting 
spores or cells are important factors for 
determining the time and magnitude of bloom 
evolution; 
• Physiological stress by iron- and light-limitation 
was suggested after the development of the 
bloom; 
• Enhancement of nitrate uptake rate (× 20) and 
marked consumption of macronutrients 
occurred; 
• A large drawdown of pCO
2
 was observed; 
• Increase in bacterial abundance was × 2; 
• Active heterotrophic dinoflagellates grazing on 
diatoms was observed after the development of 
the bloom; 
• Gut-pigment contents of dominant copepods 
increased (× 4–18) but the absolute value was 
small; 
• Picophytoplankton showed low growth rate 
before iron fertilization. Their growth rate was 
increased by iron fertilization. Quick responses 
in growth rate of picoeukariotes were observed 
on Day 2; 
• Nanoheterotrophs showed a few days’ delay to 
the increase in picoplankton growth, and 
grazing balanced picoplankton growth at the 
end of the experiment; 
• Increase in grazing pressure on phytoplankton 
chain-forming Chaetoceros debilis by 
Gyrodinium sp. and G. spilale was observed 
during Days 9–13; 
• Heterotrophic dinoflagellates (HDF) were the 
key grazers in SEEDS-I; 
• Are larger HDF species abundant in the Western 
Subarctic Gyre compared with the eastern 
equatorial Pacific and the Southern Ocean? 
4 
• The contribution of HDF to the loss of diatoms 
in the surface mixed layer was significant 
during Days 9–13. 
 
SERIES 
• During phase II (Days 10–19) of the bloom, 
microplankton were dominant, comprising more 
than  80% of total Chl-a; 
• There was a dynamic mixed layer ranging from 
less than 10 m to more than 40 m throughout the 
bloom, resulting in patch dilution; 
• Dissolved iron concentrations were reduced to 
ambient levels by Day 12; F
v
/F
m
 values suggest 
that phytoplankton were Fe stressed by Day 14; 
• Chaetoceros spp. ceased increasing in 
abundance by Day 15, possibly due to iron 
stress; 
• Pseudo-nitzschia spp. maintained similar 
growth rates throughout the bloom, until SiO
3
 
concentrations were depleted; 
• Although pennate diatoms dominated the bloom 
numerically with respect to carbon, both 
pennate and centric diatoms contributed equal 
proportions to algal biomass; 
• The bloom peaked physiologically on ~July 21 
(Day 12); this was the beginning of diatom iron 
stress; 
• Primary production peaked on July 24 (Day 15); 
this was the beginning of diatom silicon stress; 
• Chlorophyll peaked on July 27 (Day 18); after 
that, was the whole community beginning to 
suffer from iron limitation? 
• Cells less than 20 μm increased from July 10 to 
16 after which a major decline in 
coccolithophorids and other prymnesiophytes 
was observed; 
• Susceptibility to photo-oxidation induced by the 
second iron addition(?) 
• Microzooplankton: rapid response (abundance 
of flagellates and dinoflagellates increased from 
July 13); 
• Grazing on diatoms might not be effectively 
carried out by abundant small copepods; 
• Eucalanus bungii and Neocalanus cristatus 
were more effective diatom consumers but were 
in lower numbers; 
• SERIES was not well matched with the spring 
period of maximum diatom grazing (N. 
plumchrus). 
 
Iron biogeochemistry 
 
SEEDS-I 
• Increased dissolved iron was mainly in colloidal 
fraction; 
• The dissolved iron concentration decreased 
rapidly, and loss rate gradually decreased; 
• The half-life of initial dissolved iron was longer 
than that during IronEx and SOIREE; 
• The disappearance of dissolved iron resulted 
from colloidal aggregation and/or iron 
biological uptake (less) 
• Particulate iron remained at high levels; 
• Bioavailability of the remaining iron (mainly 
particulate) was low; 
• The character of organic ligands changed 
rapidly upon iron enrichment 
 
SERIES 
• Only 35% of the added iron was in a dissolved 
state after 8 h; 
• The half-life of total iron was determined to be 6 
days for an integrated water column of 0–40 m 
but 3 days for the 10 m depth concentration; 
• If we also consider horizontal spreading, only 
half the total iron was still in the patch after 10 
days; 
• Colloidal iron % of total iron appeared to be 
decreasing while particulate iron increased; 
• After 11 days there was still a considerable 
amount of iron left in the patch (~30%); 
• Ligands seemed to track the dissolved iron 
concentration and seemed to disappear rapidly 
together with the dissolved iron concentration; 
• Dissolved iron was near background level on 
July 22 (Day 13). 
 
Trace-gas production, air–sea interaction 
 
SEEDS-I 
• There was no significant increase in dimethyl 
sulfide (DMS). 
 
SERIES 
• The iron enrichment created a bloom of 
DMSP-rich nanophytoplankton which crashed 
after July 20 (Day 11); 
 
5 
• Concentrations of particulate dimethyl- 
sulfoniopropionate (DMSPp) doubled during 
the nanophytoplankton (Emiliana huxleyi) 
bloom; 
• The addition of iron created an overall DMS 
deficit of 7% in the mixed layer; 
• The iron-induced increase in DMSPp had no 
clear effect on DMS concentrations, indicating 
that processes (e.g., grazing) are more important 
than pool size; 
• DMS concentrations were lower inside the 
patch during the peak of the diatom bloom; 
• The iron-induced deficit in DMS concentrations 
during the peak of the diatom bloom resulted 
from a decrease in biological DMS net 
production. 
 
Model studies 
 
• A rapid response of microzooplankton grazing 
on small phytoplankton occurred; 
• NH
4
 buildup occurs after the bloom and stays in 
the subsurface layer up to early winter. 
  
Similarity and differences between the 
eastern and western subarctic Pacific  
 
Both SEEDS-I and SERIES have demonstrated 
increased productivity and biomass of 
phytoplankton as a response to the iron enrichment.  
Bloom evolution and decline were captured in 
detail during SERIES.  However, there are 
differences in the physical and chemical 
environments, the plankton ecosystem and 
dominant species, and the zonal iron gradient 
between the Western Subarctic Gyre (WSG) and 
the Alaskan Gyre (AG).  From SEEDS-I and 
SERIES, the following similarities and differences 
in biogeochemical and ecosystem responses to the 
iron addition were pointed out: 
 
Similarities 
• A diatom bloom occurred accompanied by a 
floristic shift to large cells; 
• Vertically-integrated Chl-a and primary 
production increased; 
• Heterotrophic dinoflagellates grazed on diatoms 
after the development of the bloom, which led to 
significant loss of diatoms in the mixed layer; 
• Copepods were not the primary grazers;  
SERIES was not well matched with the spring 
period of maximum diatom (Neocalanus 
plumchrus) grazing; 
• DOC increased during the growth phase of 
bloom, was constant through the stationary 
phase, and decreased during the bloom decline;  
DOC production was about 10% of primary 
production; 
• Increased dissolved iron was mainly in colloidal 
fraction; 
• Dissolved iron concentration decreased rapidly 
by colloidal aggregation and biological uptake 
(less), and loss rate gradually decreased; 
• Particulate iron concentrations remained high;  
bioavailability of the remaining iron (mainly 
particulate) was low; 
• The majority of macronutrients were consumed; 
• An increase in Si/NO
3
 drawdown ratio was 
observed after an occurrence of physiological 
stress, such as iron and light limitations. 
 
Differences 
• A larger and faster response (in terms of 
biomass) was observed in the WSG; 
• Initial diatom populations were largely neritic 
for the WSG and pelagic for the AG;  neritic 
species responded quickly to the iron 
enrichment and built up a large biomass, 
suggesting that the presence of coastal species 
as resting spores or cells is important in 
determining the magnitude of bloom evolution; 
• The bloom was characterized by two ecological 
phases in SERIES.  Phase I consisted of 
nanophytoplankton (prymnesiophytes) and 
occurred before Day 10 of the experiment; 
phase II was mainly diatoms and began after 
Day 10; 
• Sediment traps collected large CaCO
3
 fluxes 
after phase I, and high biogenic silica and POC 
fluxes after phase II during SERIES, but not in 
SEEDS-I.  SEEDS-I occupation may have been 
too short to observe an export event; 
• more than 50% of the mixed-layer POC deficit 
was attributed to bacterial re-mineralization and 
mesozooplankton grazing in the AG;  NH
4
 in 
surface waters increased throughout the bloom; 
• Characteristics of organic ligands changed 
rapidly upon iron enrichment in the WSG;  
ligand concentrations tracked dissolved iron 
concentrations in the AG, rapidly disappearing 
together with the dissolved iron concentration; 
• The iron enrichment created a bloom of 
6 
DMSP-rich nanophytoplankton (Emiliania  
huxleyi) which crashed after Day 11 in SERIES, 
but no significant increase in DMS/DMSP was 
observed in the WSG; 
• The iron-induced increase in DMSPp had no 
clear effect on DMS concentrations in the AG; 
• The iron-induced deficit in DMS concentrations 
during the peak of the diatom bloom resulted 
from a decrease in biological DMS net 
production in the AG. 
 
Southern Ocean Iron Experiment 
 
The Southern Ocean Iron Experiment (SOFeX) 
was performed in 2002 to investigate the effects of 
iron enrichment in regions with high and low 
concentrations of silicic acid.  From the results of 
SOFeX, the following questions were identified to 
be resolved in future experiments. 
 
• What are Fe:C:Si:N:P uptake and re-generation 
stoichiometries?  How are these stoichiometries 
related to phytoplankton community structure?  
How do they change under macronutrient 
limitation (Si)?  What are the spatial scales over 
which these elements are regenerated? 
• What is the steady-state condition?  Is this a 
relevant question? 
• What is the periodicity and magnitude of natural 
iron enrichment, both seasonally and 
inter-annually, and on glacial–interglacial time 
scales? 
• What is the effect of iron enrichment on the 
geochemistry (low O
2
 and de-nitrification) and 
ecology (nitrification) below and within the iron 
patch? 
• Do ecosystems respond in a natural manner to 
artificial iron enrichments? Effects on all 
biogeochemical parameters were well outside 
the contemporary climatological mean.  What 
are the similarities and differences between 
natural and artificial iron supply? 
• How important is NH
4
 inhibition on NO
3
 uptake 
and nutrient dynamics? 
 
We need to rethink the effects of iron enrichment in 
low silicate and high nitrate environments, 
Si-limitation limited diatom growth in the North. 
We must address this issue as it bears directly on 
the significance for iron forcing of 
glacial–interglacial transitions and unintended 
consequences. 
  
 
 
7 
2.2 What are the outstanding questions? 
 
SEEDS-II is the second meso-scale iron 
enrichment experiment in WSG designed to 
investigate the longer-term effects of iron 
enrichment on the plankton ecosystem, carbon 
export and trace gas production.  SEEDS-II will 
involve about 50 researchers from universities and 
government institutions in Japan, the United States 
and Canada.  The iron-enriched patch will be 
monitored by two ships, the R/V Hakuho Maru 
(Japan) and the R/V Kilo Moana (U.S.A.), for 34 
days from July 21 to August 23, 2004.  Through the 
integration and synthesis of the findings from 
SEEDS-I, SERIES and SOFeX, the workshop 
participants identified the following key themes 
and key scientific questions for the SEEDS-II 
experiment. 
 
Fate of carbon 
 
• What portions of organic carbon fixed by 
coastal centric diatoms in the WSG will be 
exported from the surface mixed layer, and what 
portions will be regenerated? 
• To what extent would heterotrophic 
dinoflagellates (Gyrodinium) respire

• What is the turnover time, size spectrum, gross 
production rate, and gross decomposition rate   
of produced DOC?

subsurface layers crucial to our understanding 
of iron-induced ecological response and nutrient

in iron availability? 
• To understand the fate of carbon during the iron 
fertilization-induced diatom bloom, studies on

pellets” sinking rates, are essential.  
 
Ecosystem responses 
 
• Why did SEEDS-I and SERIES have opposite 
trends in dominant diatom composition? 
• What is the role of cell lysis on changes in 
available nutrients, sources of DMSP, bacterial 
community structure and iron chemistry? 
• What roles will sinking and grazing play in the 
decline of the bloom? 
• What is the long-term effect of iron availability 
on the ecosystem?  How is the response to 
further iron addition affected? 
• The ecological response to iron enrichment is 
largely determined by the seed population.  
What will the species variability and ecosystem 
differences be between iron-induced blooms in 
the same location? 
• How predictable will the species response be to 
iron addition? 
• Why does iron addition to bottles result in N 
limitation, but the large-scale iron additions 
show Si depletion?

those that occur at other times of the year? 
• What is the importance of the presence of 
endemic zooplankton at the time of iron

Labile particulate iron was significantly higher 
in the surface mixed layer in the WSG, but 
dissolved iron was at the same level as in the 
eastern region. 
• Is bioavailability of iron (not total iron input) 
most important for ecosystem response? 
• What form of iron best indicates bioavailability?

bioavailability. 
• To construct an iron budget, more detail is 
needed from vertical iron flux–sediment trap 
data, both horizontally and vertically, for a 
better understanding of the various forms of 
iron. 
• Is there atmospheric deposition in these two 
different regions?

2.3 Recommendations for SEEDS-II
  
• It was recommended to lengthen the experiment 
if possible;  the decline will depend on patch 
physical dynamics, bloom dynamics, etc. 
• An additional suite of measurements is required 
to study bloom evolution, including fast 
repetition rate fluorometry (FRRF), flavodoxin, 
sinking rates, TEPS, and supplement these with 
15
N and 
32
Si uptake rates; 
• Additional methods are required to determine 
the role of the microbial community and 
zooplankton in the fate of POC and O
2
 profiles 
of the upper ocean, community respiration, 
labelled particle decomposition experiments; 
• Additional experiments are required for 
measuring export flux, such as trap calibration 
with thorium, large-volume pump thorium 
samples, more fluorometers for the upper trap 
moorings; 
• Estimates of silica dissolution, bacterial 
production and respiration (Bacterial C demand), 
and bacterial iron-stress should occur; 
• Measurements of micro and mesozooplankton 
grazing on bacteria, phytoplankton, 
zooplankton and detritus are desirable; 
• Biological patchiness in species and export 
within the patch should be considered; 
• Response by changes in physiology of 
phytoplankton cells should be distinguished 
from that by changes in dominant species; 
• Physical dilution from outside affects the patch 
chemistry and biology. The correction of 
dilution effects on budget calculations is 
essential; 
• Intercalibration and data coverage between 
ships should be as robust as for SERIES.

3.1 Synthesis of the Iron Enrichment Experiments:  SEEDS and SERIES 
 
 
Iron fertilization experiment in the western subarctic Pacific (SEEDS)

The Subarctic Pacific Iron Experiment for the 
Ecosystem Dynamics Study (SEEDS) was 
conducted in the western subarctic Pacific (48.5°N, 
165°E) from July 18 to August 1, 2001 (Fig. 1).  
The experiment consisted of a single addition of 
350 kg iron as FeSO
4
 with 0.48 M of an inert tracer 
gas sulphur hexafluoride, over an 8 × 10 km patch.  
 
Concentrations of dissolved iron increased to  
1.88 nM just after the iron injection, and 
subsequently decreased rapidly to 0.99 nM on Day 
2.  After this first rapid decreasing phase, the loss 
rate gradually decreased, and the iron concentration 
did not fall below about 0.15 nM, even after 
phytoplankton bloom development.  The added 
iron stayed in the surface mixed layer in particulate 
form throughout the observation.  
 
The first response of phytoplankton to iron input 
was observed on Day 2 as the increase in the 
photochemical quantum efficiencies of algal 
photosystem II (F
v
/F
m
) measurements of a fast 
repetition rate fluorometer. The increase in 
phytoplankton biomass became significant from 
Day 6 and exponentially increased to about  
20 mg m
–3
 in chlorophyll-a concentrations until 
Day 10 (Fig. 2).  After that, a relatively constant 
biomass of phytoplankton was observed from Day 
9 to the end of the observation (Day 13).

In addition, the iron supply led to floristic shifts 
which resulted in the dominance of chain-forming, 
large centric diatoms. The fast growth and 
accumulation of large centric diatoms had not been 
observed in the earlier iron fertilization 
experiments conducted in the equatorial Pacific and 
the Southern Ocean. This large increase of 
phytoplankton standing stock was accompanied by 
large drawdowns of macronutrients, pCO
2
, and 
dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC).  Figure 3 shows 
that nitrate was abundant at 18 µM before the iron 
fertilization. The absolute nitrate uptake rate at 5 m 
depth sharply increased by 20 times after Day 7.  
The change of pCO
2
 inside the iron patch was 
observed after Day 5.  The maximum differences of 
pCO
2
 and nitrate concentration in the surface water 
between inside and outside of the patch were 170 
ppm and 11.7 µM, respectively, which were 
observed on Day 12. 
 
High export flux of carbon in the patch was 
observed between Days 10 and 12 (Fig. 4). 
However, the export flux measured with drifting 
traps in the patch was not significantly different 
from that outside of the patch.  The export flux 
between Day 2 and Day 13 was 12.6% of the 
integrated primary production in the patch.  
Moreover, the increase of particulate organic 
carbon (POC) content in the surface mixed layer 
was 78% of the decrease in DIC and influx of CO
2
 
from the sea surface. These results suggest that a 
major part of the fixed carbon still stayed in the 
surface mixed layer as particulate matter at the end 
of our observations.  We were not able to determine, 
through lack of data, if the still-remaining organic 
matter had ultimately settled down, or decomposed 
in the mixed layer after our observations. 
 
Highlights of this experiment have been published 
as Tsuda et al. (2003) and Nishioka et al. (2003), 
and other results have been published as 13 original 
papers in a special issue of Progress in 
Oceanography (2005, V olume 64).

Abstract 
 
An iron enrichment experiment (Subarctic 
Ecosystem Response to Iron Enrichment Study), 
SERIES was carried out at Ocean Station Papa 
(50°N, 145°W) in the subarctic Northeast Pacific 
Ocean in July 2002, in order to observe the 
physiological, ecological and biogeochemical 
responses to a release from iron stress in these 
high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) waters.  The 
patch was created by injecting FeSO
4
⋅7H
2
O (iron 
source) and SF
6
 (water mass tracer) into the ship’s 
wake while a Lagrangian grid of 8 km × 8 km was 
navigated.  During the 27 days of occupation after 
iron release, the patch grew from < 100 km
2
 to 
approximately 1000 km
2
, and at Days 15–16 of the 
experiment, the patch shifted from a northward to 
an eastward drift, towards the centre of an eroded 
eddy.  Shortly after, salinity and nutrient 
concentrations below ~10 m depth began to 
increase and, simultaneously (and possibly 
coincidentally), the iron-induced diatom bloom 
crashed.  Mass balances of nitrogen and silicon 
were performed for two periods, separated at Day 
20, when mixed-layer nutrient concentrations 
began to increase.  Prior to Day 20, drawdown of 
silicic acid and nitrate was 13 μM and 5 μM, 
respectively, in the upper 30 m.  Si[OH]
4
 drawdown 
was balanced by biogenic silica (BSi) accumulation 
in the upper 50 m and sediment-trap flux at 50 m 
(export flux), while NO
3
–
 drawdown was balanced 
by the accumulation of particulate organic nitrogen 
(PON) and NH
4
, and PON  export flux.  Because of 
the injection of nutrients below ~10 m after Day 20, 
nutrient drawdown was not observed for the latter 
part of the experiment, but there was a large 
decrease in BSi and PON concentrations in the 
upper 50 m.  The decrease in BSi concentration was 
balanced by sediment-trap fluxes of BSi, but the 
decrease in PON concentration exceeded the sum 
of NH
4
+
 
accumulation and PON export flux.  The 
imbalance in the nitrogen budget might be 
attributable to the poor constraint of changes in the 
dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) pool, or by the 
fact that dilution during patch growth has not been 
considered.  These latter factors are the focus of 
on-going work. 
 
Introduction 
 
Over the past decade, mesoscale iron enrichment 
experiments have been performed to test the 
hypotheses that iron limits phytoplankton growth in 
HNLC regions of the world’s oceans (e.g., Gran, 
1931; Martin and Fitzwater, 1988), and that greater 
wind-driven iron delivery to these regions during 
glacial periods resulted in higher primary 
production and organic carbon export, leading to 
the increased sequestration of carbon in deep 
oceanic waters and relatively low atmospheric CO
2
 
concentration during glacial times (Martin, 1990).  
All previous iron enrichment experiments have 
resulted in significant photosynthetic responses, 
and thus have demonstrated iron limitation in 
HNLC waters.  However, bloom termination and 
export from the mixed layer have been observed 
only for the SERIES experiment.  In some cases, 
the lack of such observations prior to SERIES is 
because physical conditions deteriorated the patch 
(IronEx I, EisenEx), but more generally the reason 
why the fate of iron-induced blooms had not been 
observed is because patch occupation had to be 
terminated before the end of the bloom (IronEx II, 
SOIREE, SOFeX north and south, SEEDS).  
During SERIES, the bloom crashed relatively 
quickly (by Day 20) and the drifting sediment-trap 
deployments caught much of the bloom export.

Sampling locations are denoted as points on the plots; T

and 30 m depth, beginning at Day 18, and the 
accompanying high nutrients. 
 
Results and discussion 
 
Several features of the iron patch are highlighted by 
the contour plots of Figure 1.  In the upper 10 m, 
seasonal warming caused temperatures to increase.  
Salinity decreased as the patch migrated 
northeastward and surface nutrients (DIC, Si[OH]
4
, 
NO
3
–
) decreased throughout the occupation.  
However, beginning ~Day 18, relatively high 
salinity waters intruded into the patch below ~10 m 
bringing with them DIC, Si[OH]
4
 and NO
3
–
 such 
that, integrated to 30 m depth, nutrient 
concentrations increased from Day 20 to the end of 
the occupation (not shown).  Although these 
nutrient increases might be interpreted as a 
remineralisation signal, other evidence that they 
were advected into the patch with the high salinity 
waters is the increase in NO
3
–
 in the euphotic zone.  
Heterotrophic degradation oxidizes organic 
nitrogen to NH
4
+
 which is then oxidized to NO
3
–
 by 
light-inhibited nitrifying bacteria, so that NH
4
+
 
oxidation occurs primarily below the euphotic zone.  
Here, NH
4
+
 is used as a remineralisation signal. 
 
For given time and depth intervals, mass balances 
account for changes in silicon and nitrogen for each 
pool in which these elements can be found.  If 
changes in each pool are appropriately quantified, 
their sums should balance input and export of the 
elements from the volume of water being 
considered.  Three events define the time periods of 
our mass-balance considerations.  A mixing event 
occurred around Day 3, and led to the decision for a 
second iron addition, as the wind event resulted in 
low in situ iron concentrations.  Period 1 (Tables 1 
and 2) begins at Day 3.  The shift from nutrient 
drawdown to nutrient accumulation at Day 20 
marks the end of our period 1 and the beginning of 
period 2.  The end of the occupation on Day 27 is 
the end of period 2. 
 
There are two pools of silicon in the marine 
environment: dissolved Si[OH]
4
 and particulate 
BSi.  Within acceptable error, changes in these 
pools in the upper water column balance export 
fluxes of BSi for periods 1 and 2 (Table 1). 
ΔSi[OH]
4 
for the upper 50 m is ~25% greater than 
for the 30 m integral.  Positive Si fluxes balance 
negative fluxes for both periods.

Also, we have not quantified mixing with waters 
outside the patch.  The general effect of mixing will 
be to make negative fluxes (nutrient uptake; Tables 
1 and 2) more negative, and positive fluxes 
(particulate accumulation and export) more 
positive, so that consideration of mixing should not 
have a large effect on the balance of the budgets of 
Tables 1 and 2.  However, better consideration of 
mixing will generate more accurate fluxes and may 
improve the balance of the budgets. 
 
Summary 
 
Iron enrichment in the subarctic Northeast Pacific 
(Ocean Station Papa) resulted in a significant 
photosynthetic response by iron-stressed 
phytoplankton.  Nutrients (DIC, Si[OH]
4
, NO
3
–
) 
decreased throughout the bloom in the upper 10 m, 
but below 10 m depth began to increase after Day 
18 due to the intrusion of a high-salinity water mass.  
Mass balances of nitrogen and silicon are generally 
good, but ongoing work will better quantify 
changes in the pool of dissolved organic nitrogen, 
and will account for mixing with waters outside the 
patch.

During the Subarctic Pacific Iron Experiment for 
the Ecosystem Dynamics Study (SEEDS), 
chlorophyll a concentration in the iron patch 
reached near maximum in 9 days (D9) after the iron 
fertilization and after that remained more or less 
constant.  In spite of the stability of chlorophyll a, 
primary production was higher than 1.4–2.0 g C 
m
–2
 d
–1
 during D9–D13.  As most of the carbon 
synthesized by phytoplankton after the iron 
fertilization (IF) was suspended in the water 
column (Tsuda et al., 2003), these results indicated 
that loss by grazing, and other factors in the surface 
mixed layer during D9–D13, was as high as 3–4 mg 
chlorophyll a m
–3
 d
–1
, assuming a C:Chl ratio of 30 
and the mixed-layer depth of 15 m.  
 
During the SEEDS experiment, heterotrophic 
nanoflagellates (HNF), microzooplankton, and 
macrozooplankton grazing rates were examined to 
understand the impact of zooplankton grazing 
pressure on phytoplankton dynamics and the 
carbon budget.  Grazing rates of HNF and 
microzooplankton were examined by dilution 
experiments.  Macrozooplankton grazing was 
measured by gut fluorescence method. 
 
In the experimental site (in-patch), copepods 
Neocalanus cristatus, N. plumchrus, Eucalanus 
bungii, and Metridia pacifica were the dominant 
macrosized grazers.  Gut pigment contents of 
copepods in-patch increased from D7–D8 and were 
4 to 18 times higher than those outside of the iron 
patch (out-patch) during the peak bloom period 
(Tsuda et al., 2005).  The community grazing rates 
in-patch were in the range between 2.4–10.2% of 
the daily primary production.  
 
Prior to the IF, aloricate ciliates were the most 
dominant microzooplankton followed by 
heterotrophic dinoflagellates (Fig. 1).  Tintinnids 
and copepod nauplii were relatively minor 
components.  Aloricate ciliates gradually decreased 
after the IF. Heterotrophic dinoflagellates, 
dominated by Gyrodinium spp., increased rapidly 
after D9 and were the most dominant in the 
microzooplankton assemblage at the end of the 
experiment.  The net growth rate reached 0.51 d

during D11–D13. 
 
Grazing rates of microzooplankton decreased with 
the development of the diatom bloom until D9 (Fig. 
2).  On D11, the grazing rate abruptly increased.  
The net growth rates (gross grazing rate – grazing 
rate) of phytoplankton decreased after D11.

Fig. 3 Gross growth rates, grazing rate and net growth 
rates of eukaryotic ultraphytoplankton (filled circles) 
and cyanobacteria Synechococcus (open diamonds). 
In phytoplankton smaller than ca. 5 μm ESD 
(equivalent spherical diameter), determined by 
flow cytometry analysis, eukaryotic 
ultraphytoplankton (EUKU) and cyanobacteria 
Synechococcus (SYN) predominated.  Before the IF, 
gross growth rates of EUKU and SYN were  
0.10 d
–1
 and 0.24 d
–1
, respectively (Fig. 3).  Gross 
growth rates of EUKU and SYN increased on D2 
and D4, respectively, then gradually decreased.  
The grazing rates on EUKU and SYN decreased 
slightly with time, and increased again after D11.  
Net growth rates of EUKU and SYN increased after 
the IF and gradually decreased with time.  At the 
end of the SEEDS experiment, growth and grazing 
mortality rates of ultraphytoplankton balanced each 
other.  
 
Present results show that all the grazers increased 
their feeding activity after the IF but responses 
were variable.  Increase in gross growth rate of 
ultraphytoplankton was the first biological 
response to the IF during SEEDS.  The grazing rate 
of HNF on ultraphytoplankton did not increase 
rapidly and excess growth was observed.  However, 
the relationship between growth and grazing 
returned to the original balanced one within 6–8 
days.  Results show that the relationship between 
growth rates and grazing mortality rates of 
ultraphytoplankton had a relatively strong 
convergent potential to balance each other against 
environmental perturbation.  
 
Grazing by heterotrophic dinoflagellates was an 
important loss factor of phytoplankton at the later 
part of SEEDS, and they might have played an 
important role in keeping cholorophyll a 
concentration steady after D11.  In general, 
chain-forming diatoms like Pseudonitzschia 
pungens and Chaetoceros debilis are too large to be 
prey for microzooplankton.  However, it is known 
 
21 
that some heterotrophic dinoflagellates can feed on 
prey larger than themselves (e.g., Jacobson and 
Anderson, 1986).  Light and scanning electron 
microscope studies showed that Gyrodinium spp. 
contained diatom cells.  The biology and ecology of 
Gyrodinium spp. in the subarctic Pacific (e.g., 
distribution, feeding rate, feeding behavior, growth 
rate, fecal pellet production rate, elemental 
composition of feces, etc.) are not well understood. 
Further studies are needed to understand the role of 
Gyrodinium spp. on phytoplankton dynamics and 
the fate of carbon synthesized during the diatom 
bloom induced by IF.  
 
Although the response of copepods to the increase 
in prey phytoplankton was quite obvious, their 
grazing influenced only slightly the phytoplankton 
dynamics within the 13-day SEEDS experiment. 
This was due to the slow growth rate of copepods 
compared to microzooplankton and HNF.  Saito et 
al. (2002) showed that the copepod grazing 
influence was insignificant at the peak phase of the 
diatom bloom in the Oyashio region, but it was an 
important loss factor of phytoplankton after 
nutrient depletion.  This suggests that the fate of 
carbon synthesized during the IF-induced bloom 
would be influenced by copepod grazing after 
nutrient depletion as well as by Gyrodinium 
grazing.  
 
One of the important pieces of information 
obtained by SEEDS is that relatively minor 
components in the food-web functional group prior 
to the IF became key players after the IF. 
Chaetoceros debilis was a negligible component in 
the phytoplankton assemblage prior to the IF but 
increased abruptly after the IF and was the most 
dominate.  The most significant response of grazers 
to the outburst of C. debilis was by a relatively 
minor component in zooplankton, Gyrodinium spp.  
These results have shown that prediction of the 
ecosystem response to anthropogenic or natural 
perturbation is still a challenging issue, and further 
studies on the ecosystem structure and the functions 
of its components are needed.

During the 2001 SEEDS (Subarctic Pacific Iron 
Experiment for Ecosystem Dynamics Study) and 
2002 SERIES (Subarctic Ecosystem Response to 
Iron Enrichment Study) experiments, on-board 
bottle incubation experiments were carried out by 
adding different amounts of iron to elucidate 
phytoplankton community responses to iron 
concentrations.  Temperature gradients from 5 to 
18°C were also applied to the incubation 
experiments because temperature affects growth 
rate and metabolic functions, such as enzyme 
reactions, in phytoplankton cells. At the same iron 
concentration, specific chlorophyll a increase rates 
(growth rates) for micro-sized phytoplankton  
(>10 µm) were the highest, between  9 and 13°C, 
almost doubled from 5 to 9°C.  The surface mixed 
layer temperature was 9°C at the beginning of iron 
fertilization, but was 5°C just two weeks before. 
We believe that this drastic increase in growth rate 
with temperature was a reason for the highest 
chlorophyll a increase in SEEDS among all the 
mesoscale iron enrichment experiments conducted 
in the HNLC regions.

During the Subarctic Ecosystem Response to Iron 
Enrichment Study (SERIES), the phytoplankton 
population depleted dissolved silicate, bringing an 
end to a bloom which had increased diatom 
biomass in the patch by more than 10-fold over the 
4-week study.  Silicate has been implicated as an 
important ballasting material that adds density to 
sinking particles and increases carbon flux out of 
the upper ocean.  Therefore, processes which 
enhance either the recycling or export of silicon 
(Si) are crucial in understanding carbon fluxes. 
 
Phytoplankton biomass increases through the 
uptake of silicate, along with carbon and other 
macro (N and P) and micro (e.g., Fe) nutrients.  The 
increased biomass is either recycled in the upper 
ocean, or is “exported” as increased animal 
biomass or as sinking detritus (Fig. 1).  Open ocean 
ecosystems export ~10% of primary production, 
the balance being remineralized in the surface layer.  
Any incorporation of organic matter into other 
trophic levels does not include silicon, causing its 
enrichment in detrital materials.  Thus, particles 
sinking out of the subarctic surface layer are 
commonly enriched in Si compared with C or N.

At Ocean Station Papa (OSP), silicate is used by 
diatoms predominantly in May and June (Whitney 
and Freeland, 1999).  This is the time of year that 
the major copepod species, Neocalanus plumchrus, 
is actively grazing (Mackas et al., 1998).  
May–June is also the period that sees the highest 
fluxes of detrital material into the interior of the 
ocean at OSP (Wong et al., 1999).  Since the 
SERIES experiment was conducted in July of a 
warm, strongly stratified year, it is likely that  
N. plumchrus had entered diapause before iron 
fertilization took place.  Thus a major grazer would 
not have been active to crop the diatom bloom that 
iron enrichment stimulated.  To look at the effects 
of grazers on the diatom community in SERIES, 
major copepod species (the dominant 
macro-zooplankton) in both the water column and 
from sediment traps were analyzed for Si content.  
Ten to 20 copepods were picked from samples then 
dessicated and digested with 1% Na
2
CO
3
 solution 
in an 85°C bath for 2 to 4 h.  Samples were then 
analyzed for silicate using standard Autoanalyzer 
procedures.        
 
Silicon dynamics for SERIES is summarized in 
Figure 2.  Silicate was rapidly drawn down between 
July 23 and 28, to the point where it was likely 
limiting diatom growth (along with iron).  The 
diatom bloom resulted in an accumulation of 
particulate Si in the upper 20 m by July 26 and a 
subsequent export of this material to sediment traps 
at 50 m depth.  The copepod community showed 
some response to phytoplankton growth (e.g.,  
Fig. 3), their numbers increasing during the bloom.  
However, an increase in numbers is likely the result 
of the patch collecting or attracting grazers as it 
drifts.  Copepod reproduction is not rapid enough to 
account for increased numbers.   
 
Copepods attracted into sediment traps (Fig. 4) 
show an increased activity in the latter part of the 
study.  The dominant (>1 mm) zooplankton 
collected by traps were the copepods Eucalanus 
bungii and Neocalanus cruistatus.  Collections of 
over 150 copepods per trap cylinder per day, largely 
24 
E. bungii, are much higher than actual numbers of 
copepods collected in net tows (tows = 3,000 m
–2
, 
traps = 26,000 m
–2
).  Also, the 100- and 125-m traps, 
which were imbedded in the pycnocline rather than 
the mixed layer, collected more E. bungii and  
N. cristatus in the final trap deployments.  
 
In Figure 5, we show our results for Si content in 
copepods collected by net tows or in sediment traps.  
The data set is incomplete in late experiment, but 
provides information on grazing by various species.  
The smaller copepods, Pseudocalanus, Oithona 
and Metridia may graze on diatoms, but because of 
their size contain little Si.  Most interesting is the 
trend in E. bungii showing increased Si content at 
the time of the Si export event.  These copepods 
appear to have increased their feeding on diatoms 
in the last several days of SERIES.  
 
To consider whether a species such as E. bungii 
could have contributed to the export of Si from the 
surface layer during SERIES, we construct a 
budget based on the number of these copepods 
collected by net hauls and on their Si content from 
traps.  The budget shows that 3,000 copepods 
containing ~5 nmol Si copepod
–1
 (0.15 µg 
copepod
–1
 in Fig. 5) yields 15 µmol m
–2
 in gut 
content, compared with 5 to 15 mmol m
–2
 d
–1
 Si 
flux to 50 m depth.  Even if copepods were 
producing fecal pellets containing this amount of Si 
every 30 minutes throughout the day, they would 
only contribute 1 to 2% of the Si flux observed 
during SERIES. 
 
These results should be considered preliminary.  
Further analyses of increases in copepod body size 
will provide independent evidence on the 
importance of grazers as a sink for organic material.  
At the present, we can only speculate that copepod 
grazing did not contribute significantly to export 
from the patch.  However, a cautionary note is that 
patch net tows were carried out during daylight 
hours.  Goldblatt et al. (1999) showed that 
migrating species such as N. plumchrus are more 
abundant in surface waters at night than during the 
day in spring.

Introduction 
 
Over the last decade considerable effort has been 
directed toward understanding the relationship 
between phytoplankton productivity and the 
availability of iron, particularly as a cause for the 
lack of significant autotrophic growth in high 
nitrate, low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions of the 
open ocean.  The results of iron-enrichment 
shipboard incubation (grow-out) experiments and 
in situ iron-enrichment experiments conducted in 
the subarctic North Pacific, equatorial Pacific, and 
the Southern Ocean strongly support the idea that 
phytoplankton growth rates and biomass 
accumulation in HNLC areas are limited, at least in 
part, by the availability of iron.  Despite the 
abundance of nitrate in the surface waters of these 
regions, phytoplankton are supported primarily by 
regenerated N forms (i.e., ammonium and urea), 
presumably because of the lower energetic costs 
needed to utilize these reduced substrates compared 
to nitrate when iron is limiting (e.g., Raven, 1990).  
In this current study, the planktonic nitrogen uptake 
response to iron addition is described in the largest 
of these HNLC regions — the Southern Ocean 
during the Southern Ocean Iron Experiment 
(SOFeX) conducted in the austral summer 2002 
(Coale et al., 2004).  This is the first report 
documenting the nitrogenous uptake response of 
natural phytoplankton communities to in situ iron 
fertilization of the Southern Ocean, although two 
previous open-ocean iron-enrichment experiments 
have been conducted in the Southern Ocean, one in 
the Australian sector [Southern Ocean Iron 
RElease Experiment (SOIREE, Boyd et al., 2000)] 
and the other in the Atlantic sector [Eisen (iron) 
Experiment (EisenEx, Gervais et al., 2002)].  The 
present study describes two nitrogen processes 
affected by the alleviation of iron limitation in the 
southern patch of SOFeX: 1) the nitrogenous 
nutrition (nitrate, ammonium, nitrite and urea) of 
the natural phytoplankton communities, and 2) the 
potential inhibitory effects of ammonium on the 
observed uptake rates of nitrate. 
 
Materials and methods 
 
General 
 
The SOFeX study was conducted at two sites both 
north and south of the Antarctic Polar Front Zone 
(APFZ), in low- and high-silicate waters, 
respectively.  We focus here on the ‘southern patch’ 
which was characterized by high nitrate  
(~28 μM) and silicic acid (~ 60 μM) concentrations, 
an average mixed layer (ML) temperature of  
–0.5°C and ML depth of 45 m.  Iron (as acidic iron 
sulphate) and the inert tracer sulfur hexafluoride 
(SF
6
) were added to a 15 by 15 km patch in the 
vicinity of 65°S, 172°W during four separate 
injections beginning on January 24, 2002 (day 0).  
The patch was then tracked and monitored by three 
research vessels in a Lagrangian fashion for one 
month.  Details of the experimental methodology of 
the SOFeX, patch dilution and mixing rates, 
biological and chemical responses, and export flux 
are presented elsewhere (Bishop et al., 2004; 
Buesseler et al., 2004; Coale et al., 2004). 
 
Sampling and N-uptake experiments 
 
Samples for nitrogen uptake experiments were 
collected from within and outside (control waters) 
of the iron-enriched patch using 30-L trace-metal 
free Go-Flo bottles mounted on a trace-metal clean, 
instrumented rosette (Hunter et al., 1996); all 
subsequent sub-sampling and manipulations were 
conducted within a laminar-flow hood (HEPA) 
using trace-metal clean techniques (e.g., Fitzwater 
et al., 1982).  Chlorophyll a concentration was 
measured by in vitro fluorometry (Parsons et al., 
1984) and nitrogen uptake rates were determined 
using the 
15
N isotope technique (Dugdale and 
Wilkerson, 1986) and on-deck simulated in situ 
incubations of tracer-level enriched samples.  The 
ammonium uptake rates reported have not been 
corrected for the effects of isotopic dilution (Glibert 
et al., 1982), and thus should be considered as 
 
27 
conservative estimates.  The inhibitory effects of 
NH

 uptake were determined by 
inoculating 1.2-L or 280-mL polycarbonate bottles 
with a tracer-level (< 10% of ambient NO

) 
concentration of 
15
N-labeled sodium nitrate (98.25 
atom %; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and a 
series of 9 to 10 concentrations (conducted in 
duplicate) of unlabeled ammonium sulfate ranging 
from 0.05 to 10 µM.  Samples were incubated 
on-deck in clear, spectrally corrected (blue) 
Plexiglas
®
 deck incubators at the ambient in situ 
temperature with photosynthetic photon flux 
density (PPFD) attenuated to the light depth of 
collection (47% of the incident surface flux).  
Incubations were terminated by filtration (< 80 mm 
Hg) after 8.5–9 h onto precombusted Whatman
®
 
GF/F filters (2.5 cm; 4 h at 450°C), and frozen in 
polypropylene cryovials until mass spectrometric 
analysis ashore. 
 
Inhibition parameters 
 
The inhibition of NO

 concentration data to two different 
functions: a simple 3-parameter exponential model 
(Varela and Harrison, 1999) and a modification of 
the inverse Michaelis-Menten equation (Harrison et 
al., 1996).  The curve fitting was completed using a 
computerized, iterative non-linear least-squares 
technique (Kaleidograph
®
; Abelbeck Software) 
which utilizes the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm 
(Press et al., 1992).  Details and the actual 
equations employed are presented in Cochlan and 
Bronk (2003). 
 
Results and discussion 
 
The fertilization of a patch of the surface waters of 
the Southern Ocean with small quantities of iron 
resulted in a massive bloom of phytoplankton (ca. 
20-fold increase), and a measurable draw-down of 
nitrate (ca. 2 µM; Coale et al., 2004).  Coincident 
with the increase in phytoplankton biomass were 
dramatic increases in nitrate utilization rates by 
phytoplankton in the upper mixed layer of the south 
patch.  Absolute (transport) uptake rates increased 
by a factor of ca. 25 in the south patch relative to

those reported for iron-amended bottle experiments 
conducted previously in HNLC regions of the 
Southern Ocean (Timmermans et al., 1998; 
Cochlan et al., 2002). 
 
The cycling of nitrogen is dramatically affected by 
iron availability.  The extent to which iron 
enrichment allows for the utilization of new forms 
of nitrogen may reflect a source of community 
growth, and at steady state, the subsequent flux 
which is unrealized in an iron-deficient system.

 and urea) uptake was 
measured and can be used to estimate ‘new’ 
production – the amount of total production that 
can be exported from the system, without depleting 
the system (Dugdale and Goering, 1967).  This 
uptake ratio, termed the ƒ-ratio (Eppley and 
Peterson, 1979), increased from 0.1–0.2 to 0.5–0.6 
in the iron-enriched waters of the southern patch 
within 3 weeks of the initial Fe injection (Fig. 2).  
The increased ƒ-ratio indicates that alleviation of 
iron limitation allows for greater relative utilization 
of the amble nitrate reserves that would otherwise 
be underutilized for growth in the surface waters 
south of the APFZ, and confirms the role of iron 
limitation in the creation of HNLC conditions in the 
open waters of the Southern Ocean.

determined in the outside waters.  While some of 
the increase in this theoretical uptake rate can be 
ascribed to the greater biomass present following 
iron enrichment, the particulate nitrogen 
(PN)-specific uptake rates (estimated by dividing 
these rates by the particulate nitrogen 
concentrations) in the iron patch also increased and 
are 2- and 3-fold greater on days 12 and 22, 
respectively, than the outside rate.  The maximal 
realized inhibition (I

outside (control) waters (84%) and decreased to 57

Conclusions 
 
The alleviation of iron limitation in the HNLC 
waters south of APFZ contributes to enhanced 
nitrate utilization by phytoplankton; absolute 
uptake rates increased ca. 25-fold (relative to 
un-enriched waters) and PN-specific rates 
increased by ca. 10-fold.  This enhancement of new 
production by iron fertilization is reflected in an 
increase in ƒ-ratio from 0.1–0.2 to 0.5–0.6 in 
surface phytoplankton communities.  Ammonium 
inhibition experiments, conducted on-deck, suggest 
that iron-replete communities are less sensitive to 
the potential inhibitory effects of ammonium on 
nitrate utilization.

Several in situ iron fertilization experiments have 
been performed with the general goal to evaluate 
whether iron availability controls phytoplankton 
production in high nutrient, low chlorophyll 
(HNLC) waters of the equatorial Pacific (IronEx I, 
II) and Southern Ocean (SOIREE, EisenEx) 
(Martin et al., 1994; Coale et al., 1996; Boyd et al., 
2000, Gervais et al., 2002).  This hypothesis was 
also investigated in the western [Subarctic Pacific 
Iron Experiment for Ecosystem Dynamics Study 
(SEEDS); Tsuda et al., 2003)] and eastern 
[Subarctic Ecosystem Response to Iron 
Enrichment Study (SERIES); Boyd et al., 2004] 
subarctic North Pacific using mesoscale iron 
infusions in order to enhance biological and 
geochemical signals.  An in situ iron fertilization 
experiment is one useful approach to investigate 
oceanographic uncertainties and to aid in our 
understanding of iron chemistry, iron biology and 
the biogeochemical cycle of iron in seawater (Rue 
and Bruland, 1997; Gordon et al., 1998; Bowie et 
al., 2001; Croot et al., 2001; Nishioka et al., 2003; 
Wells et al., 2003).  In this report we have 
summarized “What have we learned regarding iron 
chemistry from previous in situ iron enrichment 
experiments?” and “What we still need to know”. 
      
Iron behavior after artificial iron release  
 
Nishioka et al. (2003) and Wells (2003) 
investigated the changes in physical speciation of 
iron in an artificially iron-enriched seawater patch.  
These studies show that physical speciation was a 
useful method for studying iron behavior in 
seawater during a phytoplankton bloom. 
 
After the artificial iron release, the bulk of the 
increased dissolved iron in the patch was colloidal 
and not truly soluble (Nishioka et al., 2003; Wells 
2003).  The dissolved iron concentration decreased 
rapidly, with the loss rate gradually decreasing 
(Gordon et al., 1998, Bowie et al., 2001, Nishioka 
et al., 2003; Wells 2003).  However, the half-life of 
dissolved iron varied by experiment, which may be 
due to differences in physical conditions, such as 
temperature, mixing due to wind, and chemical 
conditions, such as ligand concentrations.  This 
disappearance of the dissolved iron probably 
results from the colloidal iron aggregation and 
biological uptake of iron (Nishioka et al., 2003; 
Wells 2003).  Dissolved iron decreased to below 
natural conditions near the end of the bloom 
(Gordon et al., 1998; Bowie et al., 2001; Nishioka 
et al., 2003; Wells, 2003; Boyd et al., 2004; Croot 
et al., 2005).  An exception was the retention of 
dissolved iron and ferrous iron (Fe(II)) after the 
final enrichment in Southern Ocean Iron RElease 
Experiment [SOIREE (Croot et al., 2001)].  In the 
SEEDS experiment, we observed the colloidal iron 
transformation to particulate iron, with the latter 
being retained in the surface mixed layer (Nishioka 
et al., 2003).   
    
The above is an overview of our knowledge 
regarding the behavior of iron from previous 
experiments, but we still need more information 
about iron dynamics, such as the role of organic 
ligands in determining iron behavior. 
 
Changes in iron bioavailability during a 
phytoplankton bloom 
 
Wells (2003) reported biological uptake as being 
responsible for the disappearance of part of the 
soluble iron in the IronEx II study.  In the IronEx II 
and SEEDS studies, a rapid depletion in the soluble 
iron fraction was observed during the 
phytoplankton bloom.  However, this depletion in 
34 
soluble iron was insufficient to support the 
observed bloom development.  Therefore, we have 
to consider an iron flux from another size-fraction 
to soluble iron species, such as a mechanism that 
allows some part of the colloidal iron to become 
bioavailable during a phytoplankton bloom 
(Nishioka et al., 2003; Wells, 2003). 
 
At the end of bloom, the Si:N consumption ratio 
increased and the F
v
/F
m
 ratio decreased (Tsuda et 
al., 2003; Wells, 2003; Boyd et al., 2004) in the 
iron-enriched patch.  These physiological changes 
indicate that diatoms underwent physiological iron 
stress after the bloom peak.  At the same time, 
higher concentrations of particulate iron remained 
in the surface water in the SEEDS and SERIES 
patches than under natural conditions (Nishioka et 
al., 2003; Johnson et al., unpublished data).  These 
results indicate that the bioavailability of the 
remaining particule and soluble iron was low.  
Therefore, the conversion of dissolved iron to 
particulate form will ultimately reduce the 
bioavailability of newly introduced iron into the 
photic zone. 
 
We still need more information regarding changes 
in the iron bioavailability and the cycling of iron 
speciation in seawater to better understand how 
diatoms acquire various iron species. 
 
Response of ligands production 
 
Rue and Bruland (1997) found the concentrations 
of organic iron complexing ligands increased by 
400% after iron infusion.  Wells (2003) indicated 
that the bulk of iron ligand complexes were 
colloidal in size, and this feature of ligand 
production was also observed in the EisenEx study 
(Boye et al., 2005) in the Southern Ocean.  Croot et 
al. (2001) reported ligand concentrations increased 
at the end of SOIREE and the ligand concentrations 
had an affect on the dissolved iron concentration. 
 
However, the source of organic ligands and their 
role in phytoplankton blooms is not yet fully 
understood.  We are still not clear in regard to the 
process of iron ligand production. 
 
What we still need to know 
 
• What controls iron retention and loss rate after 
iron release? 
 
Iron retention and loss rate after iron release may be 
controlled by physical and chemical conditions.  
We especially need to know more about chemical 
conditions, such as the role of organic ligands on 
iron concentrations and loss rates. 
 
• Response of ligand production to iron infusion, 
the main source of ligand production and the 
role of iron ligands in a phytoplankton bloom  
 
Although we observed an iron release-induced 
increase of organic ligands, the source of these 
ligands and their affinity for each iron species is not 
yet known.  Furthermore, we still need to learn 
about the role of organic ligands in regard to iron 
dynamics and iron uptake by organisms during the 
phytoplankton bloom. 
 
• Changes in iron bioavailability during a 
phytoplankton bloom and how diatoms acquire 
iron species  
 
We still do not have enough knowledge regarding 
the bioavailable iron species in seawater.  There 
may be complex interactions between the organic 
fraction and soluble, colloid and particle iron.  We 
need to investigate these interactions for a better 
understanding of bioavailable iron fluxes to 
diatoms.  This knowledge is very important in the 
understanding of how diatoms acquire iron species 
in seawater. 
 
•  The role of Fe(II) in a phytoplankton bloom  
 
Croot et al. (2001) reported that there was a 
significant concentration of Fe(II) in the SOIREE 
and the EisenEx experiments (Croot et al., 2005).  
The role of Fe(II) in a phytoplankton bloom 
immediately after the iron release might be 
important in understanding biological uptake.  
Redox and photochemical cycling will also 
influence iron chemistry. 
 
• Comparison with natural iron supply  
 
Lastly, we suggest the importance of comparing our 
knowledge of these in situ enrichment studies with 
the natural iron supply.  The input of iron via in situ 
enrichment studies is very different from the 
natural iron supply, but the studies still contribute 
very useful knowledge towards our understanding 
 
35 
of the biogeochemistry of iron and its role in 
phytoplankton dynamics in HNLC regions.

Over the past two decades, low iron values have 
been shown to be a major cause for limiting 
phytoplankton growth in large, macronutrient rich 
areas of the world’s oceans.  Iron enrichment 
experiments conducted in the Equatorial (IronEx I, 
Martin et al., 1994 and IronEx II, Coale et al., 
1996) and the Southern Ocean (SOIREE, Boyd et 
al., 2000 and SOFeX) in regions of high nitrate, 
low chlorophyll (HNLC) have demonstrated 
increased productivity as a response to the added 
iron.  However, the subarctic Pacific waters had not 
been investigated.  In 2001, the first such subarctic 
experiment, the Subarctic Pacific Iron Experiment 
for the Ecosystem Dynamics Study (SEEDS, Tsuda 
et al., 2003) was conducted in the Northwest 
Pacific with similar results.  This was part of a plan 
that was conceived at the first meeting of the 
PICES Advisory Panel on Iron Fertilisation 
Experiment in the subarctic Pacific Ocean 
(October 2000, Tsukuba, Japan) where experiments 
were proposed in both the eastern and western 
Pacific.  A collaborative project between Canada 
and Japan was proposed to study iron limitation in 
the subarctic Pacific, which has strong east–west 
zonal gradients in atmospheric iron deposition and 
plankton communities.  Here, we describe the iron 
dynamics in the second subarctic experiment, 
SERIES (Subarctic Ecosystem Response to Iron 
Enrichment Study), near station P26 (station P, 
50ºN, 145ºW) in the Northeast subarctic Pacific as 
the first field experiment of Canadian SOLAS 
(Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study) funded 
jointly by NSERC (Natural Science and 
Engineering Research Council), CFCAS (Canadian 
Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences) 
and DFO (Department of Fisheries and Oceans). 
 
The iron injection experiment was initiated at 0050 
Pacific Daylight Savings Time (PDT) on July 9, 
2002 at a site (50º 08.6′N, 144º 45.4′W) northeast 
of station P26, using an expanding square method 
made possible by the ship’s (CCGS John P. Tully) 
Search and Rescue ECPINS
®
 package.  The release 
track covered an area of 4.75 × 4.74 nautical miles 
and was completed in 18 h travelling at a speed of ~ 
4 knots.  Two tanks filled with just under 10,000 L 
of seawater and acidified to a pH of 1.6 to 1.7 and 
each containing 1068 kilograms of iron sulphate 
heptahydrate per tank were mixed using swimming 
pool pumps (2 horsepower) and injected along with 
SF
6
.  This amount of iron was expected to give a 
4-nM iron increase to ambient levels for a 65 km
2 
patch of 30 m mixed depth.  The injection area was 
actually 77 km
2 
resulting in an addition of 90 moles 
of iron per square kilometre (or  
90 μmol/m
2
).  
 
The first V-fin survey (Fig. 1) undertaken was 5.5 h 
after completion of the injection.  The V-fin 
sampler was towed at approximately 2 to 3 m depth 
and the samples collected were analyzed primarily 
for dissolved iron.  The concentration found was 
only 3 nM (3 μmol m
–3
).  Although this was close to 
our target of 4 nM, it was only a third of what we 
calculated due to the shallow 10-m thermal layer.  
Bowie et al. (2001) reported finding as much as 
84% of the initial iron added in SOIREE in the 
dissolved phase.  We only had one sample for total 
iron in the patch but since the dissolved iron was 
fairly well distributed (2.8 ± 0.3 nmol L
–1
, n = 5), 
we feel we can use that total value as a good 
indication of the patch total iron concentration with 
some confidence (± 11%).  The value determined 
was 8.6 nM, yielding an estimate of 86 mol km
–2
.  
This estimate is within 5% of the calculated value 
for the iron addition and within the error of 
fluctuation of patch iron concentrations.  Thus, 
approximately two thirds of the iron added was 
already associated with particulate matter. 
 
A second survey 9 h later, or 17 h after the injection, 
found lower iron levels.  The maximum dissolved 
iron was less than 80% of what we had found 9 h 
earlier and the total was only 60%.  This was likely 
a result of the removal of iron via sinking particles 
as well as dilution of the iron patch both 
horizontally and vertically, with vertical dilution 
being stronger over this short time period.

Fig. 2 Profiles of total iron for P26 prior to injection and for patch centre for the first 2 days (July 10 and 11) after 
injection. 
 
 
The first profiles of iron (Fig. 2) collected 20 h after 
the injection shows iron to 20 m.  The second 
profile (48 h) also shows iron below the 10 m 
thermal layer.  If we integrate the iron in the water 
column over 20 m or 40 m (maximum sampling 
depth) we actually find more iron than that added 
(124 to 134 μmol m
–2
) for total iron on July 10.  
This could be due to patchiness or due to the 
estimation of the iron concentration in the top 5 to 
10 m.  If we use the value from the V-fin survey just 
prior to the pumping profile, we reduce the estimate 
of integrated iron by 20 μmol m
–2
.  Even then the 
values for July 10 are still high (116 μmol m
–2
).  On 
July 11 the iron concentration was at the expected 
level (90 μmol m
–2
) but about 20% less than the 
previous day.  July 12 was almost identical to  
July 11, except for a lower surface value.  
A change in the weather from calm to windy then 
mixed the water column down to 31 m.  At this time 
there was even a trace of iron at 40 m, so that some 
iron was now sinking out of the patch and our 
sample area.  The iron in the water column was 
constantly decreasing as is shown in the 10 m time 
line (Fig. 3).  By July 15  (Day 6) surface dissolved 
iron was down to 0.4 nM (87% reduction) and the 
integrated total iron was 52 μmol m
–2 
(a 42% 
reduction).  Because of the low surface dissolved 
iron, a second injection was undertaken.  The iron 
was added only where we could detect SF
6
 in more 
of a rectangular pattern as the patch had stretched in 
a north–south direction.  The addition was 
calculated to give an increase of 19.7 μmol m
–2
 for 
a 92 km
2
 patch.  In this case, we found only 81% of 
the expected iron increase (i.e., 16 μmol m
–2
 versus 
38 
19.7 μmol m
–2
 added) in our first sampling after the 
second release.  The increase was relatively minor 
as the dissolved iron concentration increased from 
0.4 nM to 0.6 nM and the total iron from 1.8 nM to 
2.4 nM in the 10- to 20-m surface waters.  By July 
20 (3 days after the second injection) dissolved iron 
was 0.2 nM in the upper 30 m, still an order of 
magnitude higher than levels found when we 
arrived in the area (0.02 nM dissolved iron for P26 
surface waters).  By the time the ship left, the 
dissolved iron had dropped to 0.07 nM (10 m,  
July 23).  These values were approaching historical 
background levels (Nishioka et al., 2001) but were 
still higher than what we found when we arrived at 
station P26 for this experiment.  Although the 
dissolved iron was becoming indistinguishable 
from surrounding waters, the labile iron and total 
iron, both of which include particulate iron, was 
still very much elevated in the patch (Fig. 4).

Iron budget  
 
We also looked at the iron budget in the patch while 
taking into account horizontal expansion (Fig. 5).  
If we apply our integrated iron values for the centre 
of the patch and assume a relatively constant 
distribution throughout, we can assess how much 
iron is staying in the patch.  This will be an over- 
estimation of the patch as the centre is not diluted as 
much as the edges but will allow us to estimate the 
iron loss over time.  Further investigation of 
dilution as observed in SF
6
 data should enable us to 
improve our estimates. 
 
On the first sampling day (1.6) we found 150% of 
the added iron based on a volume of 99 km
2
 (Cliff 
Law, pers. comm.) based on the assumption that the 
patch was completely homogeneous.  This is at 
least a 50% overestimation of the total iron for a 
patch that had increased in area by 28%.  If we 
adjust for this overestimation of iron and assign a 
value of 100% for Day 1.6, we find that as the patch 
increased over the next 2 days, we still had 
approximately 90% of the total iron in the patch.  
By Day 7 (just prior to the second injection) we still 
calculated almost 72% for total iron, or a 38% 
reduction from the first profile (Day 1.6).  The 
second injection covered an area of 92 km
2
 which is 
significantly less than the estimated area of the 
patch and therefore, makes budget calculation 
much more difficult but will be addressed in the 
future. 
 
The other way to calculate the iron budget is to 
ignore the horizontal dilution, which was 
significant, and look only at the integrated iron of 
the patch centre.  This will give us an 
underestimation of the iron remaining in the patch.  
Our first value was high, however, indicating that 
the patch was probably not homogeneous to start 
with or our calculation error is 20%.  The day after 
the injection, we calculated more than 120% and by 
Day 6.8 prior to the second injection, almost 60% 
of the total iron was still accounted for in the top  
40 m of the patch.  From this we estimate the half 
life of the total iron in the patch to be approximately 
6 days.  Even by Day 11 we found 24% of the total 
iron in the centre station of the patch.  When 
sediment trap data becomes available we will add 
this dimension to the results. 
 
On the other hand, dissolved iron disappeared more 
rapidly.  Using dissolved iron, we can only account 
for one third of the iron during our first sampling, if 
we assume it was all dissolved to begin with.  It 
remained at this level for the first 2 days.  Dissolved 
iron, based on patch centre station integration, 
dropped significantly to 12% on Day 3 and was 
only 10% by Day 6 prior to the second injection.

Summary  
 
Only a third of the iron added to the patch was in 
the dissolved state after 8 h (first sampling).  By 
Day 6 the dissolved iron, as measured in the water 
column at the centre of the patch, was only 10% of 
what was added but the total iron was still at 60%.  
The half life of the total iron was estimated to be 6 
days. After 11 days we could still account for 
approximately 30% of the added iron.  The iron 
appeared to be changing phases, with particulate 
iron increasing and colloidal iron decreasing. 
 
The question remaining is what form of iron best 
indicates bioavailabilty?  With this, we need to 
know uptake or consumption of iron for various 
organisms and how iron is recycled, and for the iron 
budget we need sediment trap data.  Since we do 
not have good spatial coverage of the patch for iron, 
we need to use SF
6
 values to determine the patch 
variations for iron content.

Introduction 
 
Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays an 
important role in both stocks and flow of carbon in 
the ocean.  Most of the organic carbon in seawater 
exists as DOC (Siegenthaler and Sarmiento, 1993). 
The pool of DOC is estimated to be 700 Gt C, a 
value comparable to the mass of inorganic carbon 
in the atmosphere (Siegenthaler and Sarmiento, 
1993). On the other hand, DOC has significance as 
a byproduct of biological productivity and as a 
substrate for heterotrophic bacterial growth 
(Carlson, 2002).  We need more information about 
DOC dynamics for a better understanding of ocean 
carbon cycling. 
 
Considering in situ iron enrichment experiments, 
the carbon budget is one of our greatest concerns.  
Although DOC is an important component in the 
carbon budget during the experiment, DOC 
dynamics has not been studied well in previous 
experiments.  In the present study, we investigated 
the DOC dynamics during in situ iron enrichment 
experiments in the western and the eastern 
subarctic Pacific, using high precision analysis. 
 
Materials and methods 
 
In situ iron enrichment experiments were 
conducted in the western subarctic Pacific 
(Subarctic Pacific Iron Experiment for the 
Ecosystem Dynamics Study, SEEDS; 48.5°N, 
165°E) from July 18 to August 1, 2001 (Tsuda et al., 
2003; Fig. 1) and the eastern subarctic Pacific 
(Subarctic Ecosystem Response to Iron 
Enrichment Study, SERIES; 50°N, 145°W) from 
July 9 to August 4, 2002 (Boyd et al., 2004; Fig. 1).  
Our investigations were conducted from Day 0 to 
Day 13 in SEEDS and from Day 15 to Day 26 in 
SERIES.  Vertical seawater samples were taken 
both in the iron patch and outside of the patch with 
X-Niskin bottles suspended on a Kevlar wire for 
DOC and chlorophyll (Chl-a) analysis.  Niskin 
bottles equipped on CTD-CMS were used for 
taking particulate organic carbon (POC) samples.  
The samples for DOC were filtered through 
in-lined GF/F filters and preserved in glass 
ampoules at –20°C until analysis.  The samples for 
POC were collected on GF/F filters which were 
kept frozen until analysis.  For Chl-a analysis, 
seawater was filtered through a GF/F filter, and 
Chl-a was immediately extracted by solvent and 
analyzed on board. 
 
The concentrations of DOC were measured (4 
replicates for each sample) with a high temperature 
combustion instrument (Shimadzu TOC-5000; 
Ogawa and Ogura, 1992). The precision was ± 0.1 
– 1.8 μM for SD or ± 0.1 – 3.1% for CV.  The 
concentrations of POC were measured with 
EA1110 elemental analyzer (Carlo Erba). 
 
Results 
 
SEEDS experiment 
 
A single 350-kg addition of iron as FeSO
4
 over an  
8 km by 10 km patch induced a diatom bloom 
during the SEEDS experiment.  Chl-a 
concentration showed a rapid increase from Day 7 
and approached 20 μg L
–1
 at the end of the 
42 
observation in the iron patch.  Integrated Chl-a 
(0–20 m) increased from 15 mg m
–2
 on Day 0 to 
302 mg m
–2
 on Day 13 (Fig. 2).  Integrated POC 
also increased significantly after Day 7.  The 
increase in Chl-a and POC was caused mainly by 
exponential growth of the chain-forming centric 
diatom Chaetoceros debilis (Tsuda et al., 2003). 
 
The concentration of DOC was about 60 μM on 
Day 0 and increased to more than 70 μM after  
Day 9 at the surface.  Integrated DOC (0–20 m) 
increased from 1.2 mol m
–2
 on Day 0 to 1.3 mol m
–2 
on Day 13 (Fig. 2).  Comparing the DOC values
 
  
 
 
 
Fig. 2 Integrated values (0–20 m) for Chl-a (top) and 
DOC (bottom) during the SEEDS and SERIES 
experiments. 
with those at Day 0, net DOC production at 0–20 m 
was estimated at 0.13 mol m
–2
 in our observation. 
 
SERIES experiment 
 
Double additions (at the beginning and at Day 6) of 
FeSO
4
 over a 77 km
2
 patch induced a diatom bloom 
which had a peak of 7–8 μg Chl-a L
–1
 around 
Day 15 (Boyd et al., 2004).  Our observations 
covered the stationary and the declining phase of 
the bloom.  Integrated Chl-a (0–20 m) decreased 
during our observation, from 138 mg m
–2
 on  
Day 17 to 27 mg m
–2
 on Day 26 (Fig. 2).  
 
On the other hand, DOC concentrations in the 
surface fluctuated between 65 and 72 μM during 
our observation in the iron patch.  Comparing the 
DOC values in the patch with the mean DOC value 
out of the patch, the net DOC production was 
estimated at 0.02–0.10 mol m
–2
. 
 
Discussion 
 
A significant portion of the organic carbon 
production was observed as DOC during the 
iron-induced diatom bloom in the subarctic Pacific. 
In the SEEDS experiment, 10–20% of net organic 
carbon production was converted into DOC.  
Significant DOC production was detected during 
the exponential growth phase of the phytoplankton 
bloom, although it is usually believed that DOC 
production occurred during the declining phase of 
the bloom (Norrman et al., 1995; Wetz and Wheeler, 
2003).  In the SERIES experiment, DOC 
production was not always significant throughout 
our observation, although it was at the declining 
phase of the bloom in which the decomposition 
process seemed to dominate.  However, if bacterial 
production was high during this period, DOC was 
likely to be decomposed as soon as it was produced. 
 
On the other hand, what we still need to learn 
remain as open questions.  The turnover time of the 
newly produced DOC is essential for estimating the 
amount of fixed carbon as a dissolved form by in 
situ iron enrichment.  A decomposition experiment 
of DOC would supply useful information to 
calculate the DOC turnover time.  Furthermore, the 
size spectrum of the newly produced dissolved 
organic matter is important for knowing the 
characteristics and bioavailability of DOC. 
Ultra-filtration is needed for this purpose.  Finally, 
more effort should be made to elucidate the 
 
43 
mechanisms for DOC production in order to know 
DOC dynamics, not only for iron enrichment 
studies, but also for the ocean system.  More 
knowledge of these issues will lead us to a better 
understanding of ocean carbon cycling.

Transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) formed 
from carbon-rich dissolved organic matter, assist 
sedimentation of organic matter out of the euphotic 
zone by forming a matrix of aggregated particles.  
The results of previous in-situ iron enrichment 
studies in the equatorial Pacific (IronEx I, II) and 
Southern Ocean (SOIREE, EsinEx) have been the 
generation of massive diatom blooms, but the 
subsequent export of fixed carbon to the deep layer 
has not been confirmed.  Estimation of the organic 
matter flux, in terms of TEP in such enrichments, is 
an important biogeochemical criterion.  Present 
work thus attempted to evaluate the enhancement 
of TEP formation and subsequent vertical flux of 
TEP during the in-situ iron enrichment experiment 
(SEEDS – Subarctic Pacific Iron Experiment for 
the Ecosystem Dynamics Study) carried out in the 
western subarctic gyre in the North Pacific during 
July–August 2001.   
 
A single release of 350 kg of iron as ferrous sulfate 
over an 8 × 10 km patch with a mixed layer depth of 
10–15 m raised dissolved iron concentration from 
0.05 nM to around 1.9 nM.  Inside the iron-enriched 
patch, Chl-a concentration increased drastically 
from Day 7, reaching a peak concentration of 
20 µg/L on Days 10 to 13.  During the experimental 
period of 13 days, the time course of TEP 
concentration in the water column, as well as TEP 
flux in the sediment trap samples, were investigated.  
TEP concentration was quantified by the 
colorimetric alcian blue staining method of Passow 
and Alldredge (1995) and expressed in terms of 
xanthan gum (XG) equivalent.   
 
Vertical profiles indicated higher TEP 
concentration in the upper 10 m, which gradually 
declined towards 70 m depth.  TEP concentrations 
in the upper 10 m increased from 45–80 µg XG/L 
before the iron infusion to 190 µg XG/L on Day 13, 
which corresponds to those observed in the 
eutrophic coastal bays.  The higher TEP in the 
surface mixed layer during Days 9 to 13 coincided 
with the stationary/senescent phase of the bloom 
when dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was released 
in higher concentration.  In the initial period of the 
experiment, integrated values of TEP in the 5- to 
20-m layer were consistently lower than those in 
the 20- to 70-m layer.  However, when the bloom 
reached the peak, the 5- to 20-m and 20- to 70-m 
integrated amount in both layers was almost similar. 
Standing stock of TEP-C increased from 0.8 to 
2.2 g C m
–2
.  Production of TEP-C by 
phytoplankton was around 260 mg TEP-C m
–2
 d
–1
 
during Days 7 to 11.  Accumulated TEP-C 
contributed about 16% to particulate organic 
carbon (POC) increase, and was equivalent to DOC 
increase.  POC and DOC increased simultaneously 
with Chl-a, whereas TEP lagged by 2 days.  A 
gradual increase in TEP below the mixed layer 
suggests that there is a lag in the downward flux of 
TEP.   
 
TEP flux estimated from sediment trap samples 
varied from 41 to 88 mg XG m
–2
 d
–1
 and the 
contribution of TEP flux to the total mass flux was 
at a stable rate.  Although the increase of TEP flux 
in the sediment trap, as the bloom progressed, 
confirms that TEP did sink out of the euphotic zone, 
a major part of the fixed carbon still remained in the 
surface mixed layer as particulate matter at the end 
of our observation.  TEP concentrations were low 
compared to those expected from phytoplankton 
standing stocks, based on natural coastal bloom 
studies.  A large diatom bloom observed in SEEDS 
did not aggregate, presumably because TEP 
production by the dominant diatoms was low. 
 
The cycling of trace metals depends largely on the 
presence of TEP because of the high binding 
affinities of dissolved organic substances and trace 
elements to surface-active exopolymers.  Trace 
metals adsorbed to TEP may be less available for 
phytoplankton growth.  During SEEDS, dissolved 
iron concentrations subsequently decreased rapidly, 
and colloidal iron decreased most significantly 
 
45 
during the phytoplankton growth. While there was 
a high concentration of labile particulate iron 
(>0.22 µm), only a fraction was retained in the 
surface mixed layer at the end of the experiment.  
These results seem to imply the importance of 
acidic polysaccharides for the cycling of trace 
metals. TEP may have an influence on the 
residence time of iron (from atmospheric dust 
input) in the surface mixed layer, although the 
function of TEP as ligands for trace metals is not 
known yet.  The role of TEP in the cycling of trace 
metals, especially iron and the bioavailability of 
iron bound to TEP, offers exciting future topics for 
research.

During the SEEDS-II cruise, the Atmospheric 
Chemistry Group is planning to measure the 
emission of biogenic gases from the surface of the

iron, to the atmosphere–ocean boundary layer 
(Fig. 1).

On the board of R/V Hakuho Maru, we have been 
preparing to measure chemical and physical 
parameters in the marine atmosphere shown in 
Figure 1.  This is the first trial to measure 
atmospheric SF
6
 which is emitted from the iron- 
enriched area in real time, developed by Y. Kajii 
and his group from Tokyo Metropolitan University 
(TMU).  It is an indicator of emitted gases from the 
waters of the iron-enriched area associated with SF
6
.  
Although the atmospheric components were not 
measured during the previous SEEDS cruise, some 
volatile organic substances in seawater, such as  
C

H

, increased in the iron patch area during the 
experiment.  It was questioned that dimethyl 
sulphide (DMS) concentration in seawater did not 
show any difference between the ‘in’ and ‘out’ 
patch areas.  For the SEEDS II cruise, the real time 
DMS measurements, both in seawater and 
atmosphere, will be carried out on the R/V Hakuho 
Maru and R/V Kilo Moana.

In addition to the aerosol samplings for the analysis 
of major and minor components and measurements 
of a number of concentrations for nano to micron 
particles with high time resolution (Mitsuo 
Uematsu: University of Tokyo and Kazuhiko 
Miura: Tokyo University of Science), frequent 
measurements for biogenic gases will carried out 
by following groups on the following ships: 
 
R/V Hakuho-Maru 
(1) DMS in seawater: Shinya Hashimoto, 
Shizuoka Prefecture University (SPU)  
• DMS, DMSPd and DMSPp in eight 
samples will be obtained from the vertical 
profiles by using P&T-GC-FPD on a daily 
basis.   
• Canadian SOLAS will measure the DMS 
turnover rate by using stable isotopes. 
(2) DMS in air: Yoshizumi Kajii (TMU) 
• They are developing a new analytical 
technique for DMS including isoprenes and 
other olefines by GC/FID/concentration.  
Besides DMS, SF
6
, O

, NO
x
, SO
2
, and CO 
will be measured continuously on board. 
 
R/V Kilo Moana 
(1) DMS in seawater and air: Ippei Nagao, 
Nagoya University (NU) 
• DMS in both seawater and air will be 
analyzed simultaneously on board. 
 
The intercomparison of atmospheric DMS 
concentration by TMU and NU, using the different 
techniques, was satisfied during the same cruise 
(Fig. 2).  In addition, the air for DMS was sampled 
on a different deck level, which suggested that there 
was no pronounced vertical gradient of DMS for at 
least several meters, although the source of DMS is 
the sea surface.

The fate of atmospheric DMS shows various passes 
for scavenging from the atmosphere as shown in 
Figure 3.  The efficiency of fine particle formation, 
which is expected to behave as direct radiative 
forcing from DMS is not known yet.  It is important 
to observe the increase in nano particles produced 
from biogenic gases, that is, DMS, directly. 
Atmospheric depositions of mineral dust (iron) and 
anthropogenic nitrogen compounds transported 
from the Asian continent may enhance marine 
biological activity.  There will be a requirement to 
confirm that there is no obvious natural 
atmospheric input during the SEEDS II experiment.

Background 
 
The subarctic North Pacific is one of three major 
high nitrate, low chlorophyll (HNLC) oceanic 
regions, along with the Southern Ocean and the 
eastern equatorial Pacific.  In these regions, uptake 
of nitrogen by phytoplankton is widely thought to 
be regulated by the availability of dissolved iron.  
The supply of dissolved iron is twofold:  via 
atmospheric deposition of dust and via upward 
transport of dissolved iron from the ocean interior 
to the surface euphotic layer.  In the subarctic North 
Pacific, atmospheric deposition has been 
considered to be the dominant source, despite little 
compelling evidence. 
 
The subarctic NE Pacific Ocean, in the vicinity of 
Ocean Station P (OSP), contrasts with the subarctic 
NW Pacific, because the strong permanent 
halocline between 100 and 150 m depth in the NE 
Pacific resists winter mixing deeper than ~120 m 
and reduces the diffusive upward transport of 
dissolved nutrients from below the permanent 
halocline.  Long-term observations at OSP, dating 
back to the 1950s, have given a relatively complete 
description of the annual cycle in physical 
properties, nutrients, primary production, 
phytoplankton chlorophyll, and mesozooplankton.  
Consequently, a number of modelling studies have 
used observations from OSP, e.g. Evans and 
Parslow (1985), Frost (1993) and Fasham (1995). 
 
Recent Canadian models with iron limitation 
 
As part of the Canadian JGOFS, GLOBEC and 
SOLAS studies, we have developed a series of 
increasingly complex models of the planktonic 
ecosystem, coupled to a 1-D mixed layer model in 
the subarctic NE Pacific with simplified regulation 
of primary production by iron (Denman and Peña, 
1999, 2002; Denman, 2003; Peña, 2003; Monahan 
and Denman, 2004).  In addition, Jeffery (2002) 
developed an ecosystem model for OSP with a life 
history representation of copepods.  Our models 
now contain nitrate and ammonium, particulate 
organic matter (detritus), two size classes of 
phytoplankton, microzooplankton, and time- 
dependent grazing by mesozooplankton, specified 
from 20 years of net tows at OSP.  A schematic of 
the current complexity level of our modelling is 
shown in Figure 1 (from Peña, 2003), along with 
the annual cycle for a “standard run” (Fig. 2), with 
parameter values selected to give results most 
congruent with long-term observations at OSP .   We 
have used these models to explore ecosystem 
responses to changes that might accompany climate 
change: 2° and 5°C warming offsets, and the 
removal of iron limitation.  Generally, these 
simulations result in large changes in 
microzooplankton biomass, small changes in 
phytoplankton biomass, more recycling, and in 
some cases, changes in export production. 
 
Monahan and Denman (2004) used long-term 
observations of winds, cloudiness and radiation to 
develop stochastic forcing functions with statistics 
(mainly variance and temporal covariability) 
matching the observations month by month.  The 
model was then run for 1000 years with 
stochastically varying forcing.  With iron limitation 
charactistic of OSP, the modelled ecosystem annual 
cycle displayed considerable variability on scales 
out to decades, but nitrate never became limiting.  
Simulations of the continental margin (near Line P, 
Station 04) displayed nitrate limitation most years, 
and simulations of conditions midway along Line P 
(~ Station 16) displayed nitrate limitation about 
30% of the summers, often for several years at a 
time.  We have added silica into the model and plan 
to rerun these experiments to see if occasional silica 
limitation can be simulated at OSP as in 
observations.

Modelling the 2002 SERIES iron fertilization 
experiment 
 
The ecosystem model described in Monahan and 
Denman (2004) has been applied to the Subarctic 
Ecosystem Response to Iron Enrichment Study 
(SERIES) experiment, with coupling to the 
inorganic carbon system and just recently to a silica 
cycle.  Preliminary results with the fertilization, 
lasting 10 or 20 days, capture the main events 
observed during SERIES:  an initial bloom of small 
phytoplankton followed rapidly by a bloom of 
microzooplankton, an eventual bloom of large 
phytoplankton (assumed to be diatoms), the final 
sinking of diatom aggregates, and the subsurface 
buildup of ammonium.  This sequence of responses 
of the planktonic ecosystem is shown in Figure 3 
for a 20-day fertilization, where the fraction of 
small phytoplankton assumed to be calcifiers was 
set to 0.25.  The eventual drawdown of CO
2
 
depends on the length of the bloom and on the 
fraction of calcifiers.  In addition, whether silica 
becomes limiting towards the end of the bloom 
depends on the assumed uptake ratio of Si:N. 
 
Future directions 
 
It is clear that for detailed model studies in the 
subarctic Pacific, a mechanistic model for iron 
must be developed.  For a global model of the 
ocean carbon cycle to be included in the next 
generation of the Canadian Global Climate Model, 
we are trying to balance a detailed representation of 
processes, such as iron limitation, with the 
requirement for a model that will represent the 
“biotic pumps” of carbon over the whole global 
ocean.

Introduction 
 
Artificial iron fertilization experiments have shown 
that the micronutrient, iron, limits phytoplankton 
growth in high nutrient, low chlorophyll (HNLC) 
regions of the ocean (Martin and Fitzwater, 1988).  
It is assumed that episodic aeolian iron input to 
HNLC regions causes phytoplankton blooms that 
afterwards decline quickly.  It is difficult to predict 
when such events will occur, so they have rarely 
been observed (mainly in sediment trap data). 
 
Iron fertilization experiments allow the response of 
the natural system to iron addition to be studied. 
Besides confirming the hypothesis of iron 
limitation in HNLC regions, they have shown that 
iron often has a short residence time in the surface 
layer due to particle scavenging and biological 
uptake.  In recent years the complex chemical 
cycling of iron in the ocean has been recognized as 
an additional controlling factor (Wells, 2003).  
However, this cycling remains poorly understood. 
 
The species composition of phytoplankton in 
nutrient (including iron) replete conditions shifts to 
a diatom-based population.  Diatoms require silicic 
acid, so their dominance will alter the 
macronutrient balance. Remineralization 
(dissolution) length scales of silicic acid are 
thought to be longer than those of nitrogen and 
phosphorus.  Thus iron fertilization causes changes 
in biological community structure and the 
chemistry of the water column.  Here, we propose a 
model, constrained by the subarctic ecosystem 
response to iron enrichment (Subarctic Ecosystem 
Response to Iron Enrichment Study – SERIES) 
data, to investigate the biogeochemical pathways of 
iron, nitrogen, silicic acid and carbon in the 
euphotic zone after a large and sudden introduction 
of dissolved iron.  
Experiment 
 
The SERIES experiment and results are described 
in detail in other papers in this report.  Briefly, three 
ships occupied the fertilized patch over a 25-day 
period.  The patch was tracked using the tracer, 
sulphur hexafluoride (SF
6
). Diatom growth was 
exponential until iron became limiting.  However, 
the diatom seed population was small so that 
initially the non-diatom species present prior to iron 
addition showed the largest response.  The latter 
phase of the bloom was dominated by oceanic 
diatoms.  Silicic acid became limiting to diatom 
growth before nitrogen and observations suggest 
that silica dissolution may be occurring at 
shallower depths relative to nitrogen than 
previously thought.    
 
Station P (50°N, 145°W) is argued to be an 
excellent site for such experiments, having 
relatively homogeneous water properties in the 
horizontal.  During the experiment, however, the 
patch sat on a strong east–west frontal gradient so 
that outer waters were not uniform in nutrient or 
salinity concentrations.  In addition, the patch 
appears to have slipped over a distinctly different 
water mass in the later course of the experiment.  
These physical changes make it more difficult to 
estimate dilution or entrainment fluxes from the 
patch in both the vertical and the horizontal.  We 
have designed our model to address this difficulty. 
 
Model 
 
The model consists of three components: physical, 
ecological and the iron component.  Below, we 
discuss the physical and iron aspects of the model.  
We will use the ecological model of Denman 
(2003; also Denman and Peña, this report).  Iron, 
carbon, nitrogen and silicic acid will be tracked as 
model currencies.  In addition, salinity and SF
6
 will 
be tracked to constrain the physical parameters.  
54 
Physical 
 
We model three physical regions separated by 
transition zones having linear gradients in model 
properties.  Each region is assumed to be 
homogeneous in properties.  The main region, the 
inside of the patch (region 1), is described by its 
area, perimeter and depth, all of which are 
prescribed to vary in time according to the 
observations (Fig. 1).  The depth is the mixed layer 
depth (MLD) (Steiner et al., in press).  The 
horizontal parameters are based on the SF

 data 
(Law et al., in press).  The area and movement of 
the MLD determine vertical entrainment and 
mixing.  The MLD and the change in the perimeter 
determine the horizontal exchange.  The remaining 
regions are the surrounding surface waters 
(region 2) and the lower layer (region 3) (Fig. 1b).  
Concentrations of model quantities in regions 2 and 
3 will be prescribed, varying in time, based on 
observations.  
 
Iron  
 
Iron in seawater exists in a variety of chemical and 
physical forms, including dissolved organic 
complexes, colloidal and particle-bound forms. 
This speciation influences the residence time of 
iron within the mixed layer, as some forms are more 
readily lost from the euphotic zone by adsorbing 
onto sinking particles than others (Bowie et al., 
2001; Wu and Boyle, 2002).  Because some iron 
species are more easily taken up by phytoplankton 
than others (e.g., Hutchins et al., 1999), speciation 
might also influence the bioavailability of iron.  
Iron speciation for SERIES is reported in terms of 
operationally defined categories by filtration 
procedures.  To make the model as consistent as 
possible with the observations, the model 
differentiates between truly dissolved, colloidal and 
particulate iron.  The dissolved pool is further split 
into inorganic ferric iron Fe(III)', which includes all 
hydrolized species of Fe(OH)
n
3–n
, dissolved 
inorganic ferrous iron Fe(II)', and organically 
complexed iron FeL.

A number of processes are known to convert iron in 
seawater from one of these forms into another.  The 
model includes the processes of:  
 
• complex formation and dissociation involving 
organic ligands (e.g., Witter et al., 2000);  
• photoreduction of the different iron forms, both 
directly (e.g., Barbeau et al., 2003) and 
indirectly by photoproduced superoxide 
(V oelker and Sedlak, 1995);  
• oxidation of Fe(II)' by oxygen, superoxide and 
hydrogen peroxide (e.g., Millero and Sotolongo, 
1989); 
• scavenging onto particles (Nyffeler et al., 
1984); 
• colloid formation (Johnson et al., 1994); 
• colloid aggregation (Wen et al., 1997). 
 
We assume that the fast reactions transforming iron 
between the three dissolved forms are in 
instantaneous equilibrium, such that the speciation 
of dissolved iron can be calculated diagnostically 
(Fig. 2).

A1.1   2000 WORKSHOP SUMMARY 
 
The workshop on “Designing the Iron Fertilization 
Experiment in the Subarctic Pacific” was held 
October 19–20, 2000 in Tsukuba, Japan.  The 
workshop was co-sponsored by PICES and CRIEPI 
(Central Research Institute of Electric Power 
Industry, Japan). 
 
The specific objectives of the workshop were to: 
 
1. Establish the current knowledge about the role 
of iron in limiting phytoplankton production in 
the subarctic Pacific;   
2. Identify the specific questions that should be 
answered by the in situ iron fertilization 
experiment in the subarctic Pacific;  
3. Initiate planning for the experiment, including 
logistics and funding, etc. 
 
The workshop had the following scientific sessions: 
 
1. General overview of IronEx and SOIREE, iron 
chemistry and biology in seawater; 
2. Chemisty in the North Pacific and IronEx; 
3. Biology in the North Pacific and IronEx; 
4. Physics in the North Pacific and iron addition 
techniques. 
 
The workshop was very successful thanks to 19 
excellent presentations and the spirited discussion 
from the 39 participants. 
 
 
 
 
 
A1.1.1   Proposed experiment summary 
 
Background 
 
The North Pacific is one of the three large high 
nitrate, low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions, along 
with the equatorial Pacific and the Southern Ocean 
that has been identified to be iron-limited (Martin et 
al., 1991). Large-scale iron enrichment 
experiments have been conducted in the equatorial 
Pacific (IronEx II; Coale et al., 1996) and in the 
Southern Ocean (SOIREE; Boyd et al., 2000).  
 
There are two prominent gyres in the North Pacific, 
the Alaska Gyre (hereafter called the Eastern 
Subarctic Gyre (ESG) with Station P on its southern 
edge) and the Western Subarctic Gyre (WSG).  The 
input of iron for the North Pacific is thought to 
come mainly from the atmospheric deposition of 
Asian dust from the Gobi Desert (Duce and Tindale, 
1991).  Hence, there is a strong zonal gradient in 
iron deposition with the WSG receiving more dust 
than the eastern gyre. Evidence for this gradient in 
atmospheric iron deposition can be seen in the 
concentration gradient of soluble iron  
(0.85 nM in the WSG versus 0.53 nM in the ESG), 
and in the phytoplankton community (the WSG has 
more centric diatoms and a spring bloom, while the 
ESG has smaller cells (prymnesiophytes and 
prasinophytes) and more pennate diatoms and no 
spring bloom (Kudo, pers. comm.)). Opal 
dominates the carbon flux in the WSG while 
CaCO
3
 dominates the flux in the ESG (Kudo, pers. 
comm.).  The WSG has been studied mainly by 
Japanese scientists, while one site in the ESG 
(Station P) has been studied mainly by Canadian 
scientists (e.g., see Deep-Sea Research II, Vol. 46 
on Canadian JGOFS).  An extensive comparison of 
the different trophic levels in the WSG and the ESG 
has recently been summarized in a special volume 
of Progress in Oceanography (Vol. 43 (2/3) and in 
particular, see Harrison et al., 1999; Banse and 
English, 1999) and hence, a thorough background 
of information exists for designing our proposed 
iron enrichment experiments.  We are proposing to 
continue this previously successful collaboration 
between Japan and Canada and invite international 
collaborators to join us in these intensive 
large-scale iron enrichment experiments where we 
have gaps in our expertise. 
 
There are several strong reasons to conduct two 
large-scale iron enrichment experiments along this 
large-scale iron deposition gradient in the WSG 
(with high deposition) and in the ESG (with low 
deposition).  These two sites are located in a 
quiescent area of the ocean with a shallow mixed 
layer depth in summer (20–30 m), a strong 
relatively shallow pycnocline (~100 m), weak and 
well defined surface currents, few frontal areas, and 
an excellent long-term time series (spanning more 
than 40 years in the case of Station P in the ESG).  
64 
Furthermore, each site can be reached in 2 to 3 
days’ travel time from major oceanographic 
laboratories in Japan and Canada. Therefore, this 
proximity will facilitate a revisit to the sites to 
determine the fate of the bloom and the associated 
response of grazers, climate change biogas 
production, and ligand production by the microbial 
community. 
 
Shipboard iron enrichment experiments have 
revealed that centric diatoms grow in WSG water 
(Kudo, pers. comm.), in contrast to a pennate 
diatom-dominated community in the ESG (Martin 
et al., 1991).  This difference in the final 
phytoplankton community will allow comparisons 
in the response of grazers, carbon flux, the 
production of climate change biogasses and a wide 
range of other parameters. 
 
The iron enrichment experiment in the WSG in 
particular, will represent a simulation of the annual 
episodic dust input from the Asian continent. 
Future plans of the Japanese Surface Ocean Low 
Atmosphere Study (SOLAS) program are to 
determine the input and effects of one of these dust 
events on the WSG .  Therefore, it is important that a 
simulated, controlled addition of iron proceed after 
assessing the response of the WSG to a natural 
episodic dust event. 
 
The iron enrichment experiment in the WSG and 
ESG will be conducted with the same methods and 
key principal investigators (Kenneth H. Coale, 
Phillip W. Boyd, and Cliff S. Law) as used in 
IronEx II and the Southern Ocean Iron RElease 
Experiment (SOIREE). Therefore, these two iron 
enrichment experiments and IronEx and SOIREE 
will offer an important contrast along a latitudinal 
gradient.  The subarctic North Pacific represents a 
site where biological and chemical reactions (based 
on surface water temperature) should be 
intermediate between the previous tropical and 
polar iron enrichment sites. For example, the bloom 
developed very quickly in IronEx II (Coale et al., 
1996) while in SOIREE, the bloom appeared to last 
>40 days according to SeaWiFS images (Boyd et 
al., 2000). 
 
Hypotheses 
 
The North Pacific has two prominent gyres, the 
western and eastern subarctic gyres (WSG and 
ESG).  These two gyres are characterized by 
relatively uniform distributions in temperature, 
salinity, macronutrients, and light, yet they have 
strong zonal gradients in atmospheric iron 
deposition between the WSG and the ESG.  
 
We hypothesize that:  
 
1. the difference in episodic iron deposition gives 
rise to distinct phytoplankton communities 
(e.g., centric diatoms in the WSG versus 
pennates in the ESG) which characterize these 
biogeochemical provinces;   
2. the biogeochemical response of any given 
province (air–sea fluxes in biogases, export 
flux of carbon, etc.) is driven by episodic 
events such as atmospheric iron deposition.  
 
To test these hypotheses, an iron enrichment 
experiment, on the scale of the entire community, is 
required in each gyre such that the biological 
community response and the resultant geochemical 
signals can be measured.  These iron enrichment 
experiments will simulate natural episodic dust 
deposition events that occur annually, especially in 
the WSG . 
 
In addition to measuring the response of a wide 
range of biogeochemical parameters to a large- 
scale iron enrichment, we hypothesize that: 
 
• the WSG will have a higher carbon flux 
dominated by an opal flux, in contrast to the 
ESG which will have a lower carbon flux 
dominated by a CaCO
3
 flux.  Thus the efficiency 
of the biological pump will be higher in the 
WSG than in the ESG; 
• there will be a larger response (more grazing) by 
the mesozooplankton in the WSG than in the 
ESG, which could lead to an increase in carbon 
flux through fecal pellet production; 
• there will be more biogas production, especially 
dimethyl sulphide (DMS) production, due to the 
larger number of prymnesiophytes in the ESG 
compared to the WSG; 
• there will be more ligands produced by the 
microbial community in the ESG than in the 
WSG because the microbial loop is more 
dominant in the ESG than in the WSG. 
 
Scientific questions 
 
• What is the fate/longevity of the bloom with an 
emphasis on ligand production and the response 
of the grazers (micro and mesozooplankton)? 
 
65 
• What is the magnitude and characteristics of 
particles (carbon flux) sinking at the end of the 
bloom? 
• What is the production of various climate 
change biogases (DMS, N
2
O, methane, etc.) 
during and after the bloom?

Summary of the Canadian program  
 
We are proposing to fertilize a 64-km
2
 patch of 
ocean near Station P in the subarctic NE Pacific 
during July–August 2002.  Iron will be added three 
or four times during the 3-week experiment and a 
wide variety of physical, chemical and biological 
parameters will be measured.  In particular, we will 
carefully document the expected increase in 
phytoplankton biomass and the subsequent carbon 
flux out of the photic zone, the drawdown in CO
2
, 
and the production of other climate change gases 
such as DMS. 
 
There are several reasons why an iron enrichment 
experiment should be conducted at Station P in the 
NE subarctic Pacific.  Station P, or Ocean Station 
Papa (50ºN and 145ºW), has a 40-year time series 
of physical, chemical, and biological parameters 
and thus has one of the longest open ocean time 
66 
series in the world.  Three large intensive sampling 
programs have provided detailed information, 
especially on biological rate process studies 
(SUPER, WOCE, and Canadian JGOFS).  This 
large published data set/time series will provide an 
excellent background to assess the annual and 
interannual natural variability for evaluating the 
magnitude of the response to the iron addition 
experiment.  The subarctic North Pacific represents 
a latitudinal gradient between the polar (Southern 
Ocean) and equatorial regions and therefore, an 
iron addition experiment at Station P will allow a 
comparison among the three large HNLC regions 
and between the eastern and western gyres in the 
subarctic Pacific. 
 
The subarctic NE Pacific has physical, chemical 
and biological properties different from the other 
two HNLC regions (Southern Ocean and equatorial 
Pacific).  In particular, it has a very shallow 
summer mixed layer depth, a strong, shallow 
pycnocline and low currents which should help to 
keep the iron patch intact and ensure the success of 
the experiment.  The biodiversity of the plankton is 
also different from the equatorial Pacific and 
Southern Ocean and therefore, the response to the 
iron addition and the flux of carbon out of the 
photic zone may be different. 
 
Unlike the equatorial Pacific, Station P is in close 
proximity (3 days steaming) to major research 
laboratories at the Institute of Ocean Sciences and 
the University of British Columbia and therefore, it 
should be easier to document the longer-term 
recovery from the iron addition.  If the detailed 
documentation of the ecosystem response to a 
single iron addition is successful, it will allow us to 
proceed to the next phase — repeated iron additions 
and longer-term monitoring that this will require. 
 
Key questions that have not been entirely resolved 
by previous iron enrichment experiments are: 
  
• How does the change in biodiversity and 
foodweb structure differ for markedly different 
ecosystems which have been perturbed by an 
iron additon?  
• What is the drawdown of CO
2
 and, especially, 
the flux of carbon to the deep ocean? 
• How does the production of ligands influence 
the iron chemistry and the longevity of the 
phytoplankton bloom?  
• How does zooplankton grazing influence the 
formation of the bloom and the carbon flux (e.g., 
fecal pellet production)?  
• What is the long-term response and recovery of 
the ecosystem following an iron addition?  
• What is the magnitude of production of other 
climate change gases, such as DMS, during the 
bloom and how is the production influenced by 
phytoplankton species, microbial processes and 
grazing? 
 
Objectives will be to: 
 
• measure the response of bacteria, phytoplankton 
and zooplankton in terms of species, standing 
stocks and rate processes to the iron addition; 
• measure the drawdown of CO
2
 and the flux of 
carbon to depth; 
• study the relationship between ligand 
production and the associated changes in iron 
chemistry and their influence on the longevity of 
the phytoplankton bloom; 
• assess the influence of zooplankton grazing on 
phytoplankton bloom formation and carbon 
flux; 
• follow the long-term response and recovery of 
the phytoplankton bloom; 
• quantify the production of various climate 
change gases during the iron enrichment 
experiment and assess the factors which 
influence the production of these biogases. 
 
Biological oceanographic sampling 
 
The upper 150 m will be sampled vertically (6–8 
depths) each day using 12 acid-cleaned PVC 
samplers on a CTD/water sampler rosette system at 
the patch centre (determined by SF
6
 levels) and in 
the surrounding waters.  Real-time vertical 
profiling of temperature, salinity, transmissivity, 
chlorophyll a fluorescence and underwater 
irradiance (PAR, 400–700 nm) will be carried out.   
Discrete water samples will be analysed for: 
chlorophyll a (size-fractionated, >20, 5–20, 2–5 
and 0.2–2 µm), heterotrophic bacterial abundance, 
microzooplankton abundance, and phytoplankton 
abundance (flow cytometry, epifluorescence and 
light microscopy).  Additional samples will be 
incubated on deck to measure rates of primary 
production (
14
C, 24 h incubation, simulated in situ 
and size-fractionated as for chlorophyll a, bacterial 
production, and microzooplankton grazing.  
Mesozooplankton abundance will be assessed from 
 
67 
150–0 m vertical hauls.  The Th:U activity ratio of 
particles in the upper water column will be 
collected using a submersible pumping system. 
 
Geochemical measurements  
 
Two types of sampling will be done: hydrocasts and 
underway sampling from the vessel’s non-toxic 
seawater supply (intake 5-m subsurface) and 
analysed by fluorometry (calibrated with discrete 
chlorophyll a samples every 2 days, corrected for 
quenching during daylight hours), and using a 
bubble-segmented automated nutrient analysis 
system, respectively.  Underway samples for 
dissolved iron will be conducted from a clean 
towed batfish sampling system, and samples for 
pCO
2
 will be drawn from the vessel’s non-toxic 
seawater system.  Phytoplankton samples for the 
single-cell flavodoxin assay will be 
pre-concentrated onboard ship and later analysed 
shoreside. 
 
Sampling will be conducted by: 
• towed batfish with a clean pump and tubing (this 
is not a pumping undulating fish): 
conductivity/salinity sensor, SF
6
, fCO
2
, pH, 
nitrate, iron, Chlorophyll a (fluorometer) 
(measurments will be sampled continuously);  
• hydrocasts by rosette CTD/Niskin samplers: T, 
S, O
2
, Chlorophyll a, macronutrients (N, P, Si) 
by auto-analyzer, iron by chemiluminescence, 
particulate iron size-fractions, total iron, 
dissolved iron, SF
6
, DIC, TA, pH, DOC, DON, 
POC, DMS; 
• free-drifting sediment traps (at 50-m intervals, 
50–600 m) deployed and retrieved at 3-day 
intervals to obtain samples for detritus organic C, 
N, P, Si, PIC, Fe, Cd, Al, rare earth elements, 
Th:U ratios, coccolithophore counts and 
planktonic species, and scanning electron 
microscope pictures;   
• deckboard perturbation experiments: algal 
carbon, growth rates and C:Chl-a ratios, etc.  
 
We (Drs. C.S. Wong and Paul J. Harrison) hope to 
have one or two strings of moored sediment traps, 
plus free floating traps.  Moored traps would be at 
the control site.  Floating traps would hopefully 
follow the patch.  It will be difficult to keep the 
patch and traps together, but there is a real need for 
trap data to try to quantify and characterize export. 
Free-floating sediment traps may perform 
differently than moored traps.  Therefore, we 
should have free-floating traps in and out of the 
iron patch.  There is a need to know more about 
microzooplankton, the effects of ligands, and also 
climate change biogases, including but not limited 
to, DMS, CO
2
, and N
2
O .  S O I R E E s h o w e d 
enhancement of nitrous oxide at the top of the 
thermocline, so this is one gas that should be 
studied.  There will be aircraft-based sampling of 
gases and aerosols above the iron patch.  We hope 
to sample over a longer time, possibly by 
back-to-back cruises extending over 6 weeks.  We 
expect to have the CCGS J.P . Tully for 4 weeks and 
will need another ship for one of these two cruises. 
Cruises could be separated by several weeks if the 
patch could be found on second cruise.  Iron 
limitation at Station P in July and August is severe, 
so the project will need to take place during this 
time. The project will be part of the Canadian 
SOLAS program. 
 
Summary of the Japanese programs 
 
A preliminary experiment of about 40 days is 
proposed during June–August 2001 on board the 
R/V Kaiyo-Maru in the WSG (45–50°N, 
160–165°E), with next effort in August to 
mid-September 2003 with the T/S Oshoro-Maru or 
R/V Kaiyo-Maru) to initiate the SF
6
/Fe patch and 
conduct the basic study. In October 2003 the R/V 
Hakuho-Maru will be used for intensive sampling 
and measurements. From analyzing long-term 
responses, we hope to:  
 
• measure responses of bacteria, phytoplankton 
and zooplankton in terms of species, standing 
stocks and rate processes to the iron addition; 
• measure the drawdown of CO
2
 and the flux of 
carbon export; 
• study the interaction between biogeochemical 
processes in the surface water during the 
phytoplankton bloom and the production of 
climate gases in the atmosphere; 
• study the relationship between phytoplankton 
(diatom) production and higher trophic levels 
(salmon); 
• assess the influence of iron supply on the 
characteristics of the plankton ecosystem in the 
western subarctic Pacific. 
 
Proposals will be submitted to the Science and 
Technology Agency (2001–2005), Ministry of 
Education, Science and Culture (2001 Basic 
Science, 2002–2004 Scientific project with high 
priority) and NEDO grant.

A1.1.2 Discussions on experimental design 
 
What do we know from IronEx I and IronEx II 
and SOIREE, etc.? 
 
Japan SOLAS is still in the preparation stage.  A 
study of the influence of natural atmospheric iron 
supply on the characteristics of the plankton 
ecosystem in the western subarctic Pacific will be 
one of the important topics.  (A long cruise is 
expected to stay at a station in the spring high dust 
season.) 
 
• Iron limitation is clearly present in populations 
of phytoplankton in HNLC regions. 
• Iron enrichment de-couples larger 
phytoplankton from the mesozooplankton 
community. 
• Evidence for carbon export in SOIREE is not 
clear.  There may have been an export of carbon, 
yet a retention of iron.  Evidence for carbon 
export in IronEx is clearer.  
• The response rate in SOIREE was much slower 
than that in IronEx. 
• There is now more interest in the effect of iron 
enrichment in different macronutrient-limited 
regimes, specifically low NO
3
 where N-fixation 
dominates N-uptake. 
• A ship-based study of light limitation of iron 
enrichment in the SOIREE region showed that 
light limitation is present at 100 m. 
• There is some interest in long-term addition 
experiments using low levels of iron. 
• The role of mesoscale eddies at Station P is 
intriguing.  They may offer a way to track a 
patch of water for years, but the phytoplankton 
community in an eddy may be untypical of the 
Gulf of Alaska.  Also, eddies have no surface 
water expression, so their relevance to an iron 
enrichment experiment is not clear. 
• The European community has just sent 
(November 2000) the R/V Polarstern to the 
Southern Ocean (in the Atlantic sector) to do a 
SOIREE-type experiment over a longer time, 
such as the CARbon Dioxide Uptake by the 
Southern Ocean (CARUSO) experiment.   
 
What do we still need to know? 
 
• There is a need to study Station P, and the NW 
Pacific, but other regions need to be studied too.  
• What is the fate of primary production (carbon) 
on POC export flux, DOC, respiration and 
response of higher trophic levels (is there an 
increase in fish production?).  The time scale is 
over a year, so a model approach is needed. 
• What are the roles of ligands?  What members of 
the community produce and take up ligands?  
• Does zinc affect other enzyme processes? 
• There is a need to study DMS/DMSP and other 
climate change biogases.  Previous iron 
enrichment studies have measured DMS 
production.  There should be both ships and 
aircraft for sampling.  At Station P, ocean levels 
of DMS are very high; atmospheric levels are 
low. 
• We need to know what factors influence the 
carbon-to-nutrient and other trace metal export 
ratios. 
• Iron might end up below the mixed layer during 
long-term commercial projects.  Will it become 
available the next summer after winter mixing? 
• Would long-term iron enrichment drive a system 
toward another limitation (N, Si, Zn, Co, etc.)? 
• What is the impact of long-term iron enrichment 
on fish? Governments may see fish production 
as a secondary benefit of iron enrichment, so 
this question will be asked of us.  The public 
may see this as a problem, due to “wrong” 
species benefiting, such as pennate diatoms that 
produce domoic acid.  (These are not questions 
that can be addressed with the current 
experiment.) 
• What are the chemical processes associated with 
iron saturation and super-saturation of seawater? 
• How does Fe(II) stay around so long in iron 
enrichment patches? 
• What are the major grazers on diatoms and how 
do they respond when diatom (pennate/centric) 
abundance increases? 
• Understanding the dynamics of the plankton 
ecosystem, export carbon flux and climate- 
related gases to iron enrichment is appropriate 
for the requests of Government and Industry 
who are seeking scientific information to asses 
the effects on future global atmospheric CO
2
 and 
environmental impacts. 
70 
What do we hope to learn from an iron 
enrichment experiment at Station P and WSG? 
 
• What are the similarities and differences in the 
plankton ecosystem response to iron fertilization 
in the subarctic Pacific?   
• There is a special interest in the east–west North 
Pacific comparison which includes differences 
in dominant species (pennate/centric diatoms) 
and export flux (Org-C/Opal/CaCO
3
). 
 
Methodology 
 
• There is a need to standardize sampling methods 
to enable comparison among experiments in 
different HNLC regions.  A list of dominant 
species and their biomass is useful for the 
comparison.   
• The first step is the application of previous 
IronEx methodology (FeSO
4
, initial 
concentration level, iron infusion timing, etc.). 
Then we may go to a new method such as the 
use of chelated iron (iron lignite), long-period 
and low-level iron supply, etc. 
• We should add DMSP to list of samples.  
• Microzooplankton are important grazers and 
dilution experiments are necessary to quantify 
the coupling of primary production and grazing. 
• Iron organic ligand studies have technical 
problems but how are they to be solved? 
• Analyses of biogases in the atmosphere are 
important, but how are they to be done? 
• Bag experiments have limitations.  Small bags 
might not represent the ocean.  Large bags are 
too difficult to manage.  However, there should 
be some role for bag experiments. 
• The use of organic chelated iron (iron lignite) 
may provide carbon source for heterotrophic 
organisms. 
• A stable isotope study will be done in SOFeX to 
see the proxy of the paleo-oceanographic 
environment. 
• After silicate in the surface water will be used up, 
a re-infusion of iron will give us some idea of 
the long-term change in dominant species. 
 
Logistics 
 
• The Station P project needs a second ship.  
Kenneth Coale recommended that a U.S. ship 
may be available if a group of American 
scientists were to propose to participate.  The 
U.S. SOLAS program would be one way to 
generate support.  It would help to have a 
Canadian–Japanese proposal ready.  U.S. 
scientists must start to prepare proposals now 
for the Station P 2002 cruise. 
• Canadian or U.S. aircraft would be useful for 
tracking the iron patch.  An airplane with a 
hyperspectral sensor would be really helpful. 
• ADIOS-2 will be launched soon.  Similar to 
SeaWiFS, it will be useful.

Abstract 
 
Through initial enrichment experiments in the 
subarctic Pacific and a series of recent large-scale 
iron fertilization experiments in the equatorial 
Pacific and the Southern Ocean, strong correlations 
in atmospheric iron deposition, marine production 
and climate change have now been mechanistically 
linked to iron limitation in the global ocean.  These 
experiments have been significant in a number of 
ways: (1) they have advanced the importance of 
iron in regulating phytoplankton production on 
global scales, (2) they have demonstrated the utility 
of open ocean enrichment experiments for the study 
of ecological and physiological processes, and  
(3) they have suggested that anthropogenically 
induced eutrophication through open ocean iron 
fertilization may be useful in controlling 
atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Although the latter 
remains an issue of current study and debate, the 
utility of iron fertilization in examining a variety of 
biological and geochemical processes has been 
unequivocally demonstrated.   
 
The ability to perform such experiments, however, 
is not trivial and involves many demanding 
capabilities.  Here, we report the theoretical and 
practical considerations of creating a patch of 
seawater enriched with iron, then detecting this 
patch and the biological and chemical signal which 
developed, in an area dominated by advective 
processes.  Physical and chemical models were 
used to predict the speciation, solubility, and the 
final concentration of iron in surface waters 
injected with acidic iron sulfate.  A Lagrangian 
coordinate system was established using a drogued 
buoy, and the iron-enriched area was tagged with 
the inert chemical tracer sulfur hexafluoride (SF
6
).   
 
This method has proven useful on four experiments 
conducted by Moss Landing Marine Laboratories 
(MLML) researchers in the equatorial Pacific and 
in the Southern Ocean.  Shipboard analysis and 
airborne observations confirmed good spatial 
agreement between the Lagrangian drifter and the 
biological and chemical signatures in the patch. 
 
The biological response, upon addition of iron to 
high nitrate, low chlorophyll (HNLC) systems, is 
becoming more predictable.  Although the inert 
tracer allows for an estimate of the physical mixing 
of the enriched waters, a well constrained budget of 
carbon export is more difficult to calculate.   
 
Experimental strategy 
 
The mechanics of producing an iron-enriched 
experimental patch and following it over time has 
been worked out in four release experiments in the 
equatorial Pacific (IronEx I and II, Martin et al., 
1994; Coale et al., 1996) and more recently in the 
Southern Ocean (SOIREE, Boyd et al., 2000).  A 
similar strategy will be employed in the CARUSO 
(CARbon Dioxide Uptake by the Southern Ocean) 
experiments now underway in the Atlantic sector of 
the Southern Ocean and will be similar to the 
methods used by the SOFeX (Southern Ocean Iron 
Experiment) group in an upcoming experiment. 
 
Form of iron 
 
Based upon the IronEx experiments, these all 
involve the injection of an iron sulfate solution into 
the ship’s wake where it is rapidly diluted and 
dispersed throughout the mixed layer.  The 
rationale for using ferrous sulfate is given in Coale 
et al. (1998) and involves the following thinking: 
(1) Ferrous sulfate is the most likely form of iron to 
enter the oceans via atmospheric deposition, (2) it 
is readily soluble (initially), (3) it is available in a 
relatively pure form so as to reduce the introduction 
of other potentially bioactive trace metals and  
74 
(4) its counter ion (sulfate) is ubiquitous in 
seawater and not likely to produce confounding 
effects.  Although mixing models indicate that iron 
(II) carbonate may reach insoluble levels in the 
ship’s wake, rapid dilution reduces this possibility.   
 
New forms of iron are now being considered by 
those who would seek to reduce the need for 
subsequent infusions.  Our laboratory has 
investigated the bioavailability of iron lignosite to 
phytoplankton in the California Current.  These 
results indicate that, on an equimolar basis, iron 
lignosite may be as effective or better in promoting 
phytoplankton growth.  Because this is a chelated 
form of iron, problems of rapid precipitation are 
reduced.  In addition, Fe-lignosite is about 15% Fe 
by weight making it a space-efficient form of iron 
to transport.  As yet untested is the extent to which 
such a compound would reduce the need for 
re-infusion. 
 
Inert tracer 
 
Concurrent with the injection of iron is the injection 
of the inert chemical tracer, SF
6
.  By presaturating a 
tank of seawater with SF
6
 and employing an 
expandable displacement bladder, a constant molar 
injection ratio of Fe:SF
6
 can be achieved.  In this 
way, both conservative and non-conservative 
removal of iron can be quantified.  In addition, the 
relatively rapid shipboard detection of SF
6
 can be 
used to track and map the enriched area 
(Upstill-Goddard et al., 1991; Watson et al., 1991).  
Addition of Helium-3 to the injected tracer can 
provide useful information regarding gas transfer.  
These experiments have been further developed 
(Law et al., 1998; Nightingale et al., 2000). 
 
Fluorometry 
 
Because the biophysical response of the 
phytoplankton is rapid and readily detectable, 
shipboard measurements of relative fluorescence 
(F
v
/F
m
) using fast repetition rate (FRR) fluorometry 
is a useful tactical tool and gives nearly 
instantaneous mapping and tracking feedback 
(Greene et al., 1991; Kolber et al., 1994; 
Behrenfeld et al., 1996). 
 
Shipboard iron analysis 
 
Because iron is rapidly lost from the system (at 
least initially), the shipboard determination of iron 
is necessary to determine the timing and amount of 
subsequent infusions.  Several shipboard methods, 
using both chemiluminescent and catalytic 
colorimetric detection have proven useful in this 
regard (Elrod et al., 1991; Obata et al., 1993; 
Johnson et al., 1994). 
 
Lagrangian drifters 
 
A Lagrangian point of reference has proven to be 
very useful in every experiment to date.  Depending 
upon the advective regime, this is the only practical 
way to achieve rapid and precise navigation and 
mapping of the enriched area (Stanton et al., 1998). 
 
Remote sensing 
 
A variety of airborne and satellite-borne active and 
passive optical packages provide rapid, large-scale 
mapping and tracking of the enriched area (Hoge et 
al., 1998).  Although SeaWiFS was not operational 
during IronEx I and II, AVHRR was able to detect 
the IronEx II bloom and airborne optical LIDAR 
was very useful during IronEx I.  SOIREE 
(Southern Ocean IRon Enrichment Experiment) 
has made good use of the more recent SeaWiFS 
images which have markedly extended the 
observational period and led to new hypotheses 
regarding iron cycling in polar systems (Abraham 
et al., 2000). 
 
What we (think we) know 
 
Biophysical response  
 
The experiments to date have focused on the HNLC 
areas of the world’s oceans, primarily in the 
subarctic, equatorial Pacific and Southern Ocean.  
In general, when light is abundant many 
researchers find that HNLC systems are iron 
limited.  The nature of this limitation is similar 
between regions but manifests itself at different 
levels of the trophic structure in some characteristic 
ways.  In general, all members of the HNLC 
photosynthetic community are physiologically 
limited by iron availability.  This observation is 
based primarily on the examination of the 
efficiency of photosystem II, the light-harvesting 
reaction centers.  At ambient levels of iron, light 
harvesting proceeds at sub-optimal rates.  This has 
been attributed to the lack of iron-dependent 
electron carrier proteins at low iron concentrations.  
When iron concentrations are increased by 
 
75 
sub-nanomolar amounts, the efficiency of light 
harvesting rapidly increases to maximum levels.  
Observations using FRR fluorometry and 
non-heme iron proteins have been described in 
detail (Greene et al., 1991; Kolber et al., 1994; 
Behrenfeld et al., 1996; La Roche et al., 1996).  
What is notable about these results is that iron 
limitation seems to affect the photosynthetic energy 
conversion efficiency of even the smallest of 
phytoplankton (Cavender-Bares et al., 1999).  This 
has been a unique finding which stands in contrast 
to the hypothesis that, because of diffusion, smaller 
cells are not iron limited, but larger cells are. 
 
Nitrate uptake 
 
Iron is also required for the reduction (assimilation) 
of nitrate.  In fact, a change of five oxidation states 
is required between nitrate and the reduced forms 
of nitrogen found in amino acids and proteins.  
Such a large and energetically unfavorable redox 
process is only possible by substantially reducing 
power (in the form of NADPH) made available 
through photosynthesis (see above) and active 
nitrate reductase, an iron-requiring enzyme.  
Without iron, plants cannot take up nitrate 
efficiently.  This provided original evidence 
implicating iron deficiency as the cause of the 
HNLC condition. When phytoplankton 
communities are relieved from iron deficiency, 
specific rates of nitrate uptake increase.  Cochlan et 
al. (2002) have observed this in both the equatorial 
Pacific and the Southern Ocean using isotopic 
tracers of nitrate uptake and conversion. 
 
Growth response 
 
When relieved from resource-based physiological 
limitation, phytoplankton growth rates increase 
dramatically (Coale et al., 1996; Fitzwater et al., 
1996).  In several experiments, over widely 
differing oceanographic regimes, we have 
demonstrated that when light and temperature are 
favorable phytoplankton growth rates in HNLC 
environments increase to their maximum at 
dissolved iron concentrations generally below  
0.5 nM.  This observation is significant in that it 
indicates that phytoplankton are adapted to very 
low levels of iron, that is, they do not grow faster if 
given more than half a nanomolar of iron.  Given 
the disagreement within the scientific community 
about the validity of iron measurements, these 
phytoplankton provide a natural environmental and 
biogeochemical benchmark against which to 
compare results. 
 
Heterotrophic community 
 
As the primary trophic level producers, it appears 
that these consumers of recently fixed carbon (both 
particulate and dissolved) respond to the food 
source and not necessarily to the iron.  Because 
their division rates are fast, heterotrophic bacteria, 
ciliates and flagellates can rapidly respond to 
increasing food availability to the point where the 
growth rates of the smaller phytoplankton can be 
almost balanced by grazing (Barbeau et al., 1996; 
Hall and Safi, 2001). Thus there is a much more 
rapid turnover of fixed carbon and nitrogen in 
iron-replete systems.  Landry et al. (2000) have 
documented this in dilution experiments conducted 
during IronEx II.  These results also appear to be 
consistent with the recent SOIREE experiments. 
 
Nutrient uptake ratios 
 
An imbalance in production and consumption, 
however, can arise at the larger trophic levels.  
Because the reproduction rates of the larger micro- 
and mesozooplankton are long with respect to 
diatom division rates, iron-replete diatoms can 
escape the pressures of grazing on short time scales 
(weeks).  This is thought to be the reason why, in 
every iron enrichment experiment, diatoms 
ultimately dominate in biomass.  This result is 
important for a variety of reasons.  It suggests that 
transient additions of iron would be most effective 
in producing net carbon uptake and it implicates an 
important role of silicate in carbon flux.  The role of 
iron in silicate uptake has been studied extensively 
by Franck et al. (2000).  Our results, together with 
those of Takeda and Obata (1995), show that iron 
alters the uptake ratio of nitrate and silicate at very 
low levels. 
 
Organic ligands 
 
Consistent with the role of iron as a limiting 
nutrient in HNLC systems is the notion that 
organisms may have evolved competitive 
mechanisms to increase iron solubility and uptake.  
In terrestrial systems this is accomplished using 
extracellularly excreted or membrane-bound 
siderophores.  Similar compounds have been 
shown to exist in seawater where the competition 
for iron may be as fierce as it is on land.  In open 
76 
ocean systems where it has been measured, iron- 
binding ligand production has increased with the 
addition of iron.  Whether this is a competitive 
response to added iron or a function of 
phytoplankton biomass and grazing is not yet well 
understood.  However, this is an important natural 
mechanism for reducing the inorganic scavenging 
of iron from the surface waters and increasing iron 
availability to phytoplankton.  Several studies 
(Trick and Wilhelm, 1995; Van den Berg, 1995; 
Rue and Bruland, 1997; Croot et al., in prep.) have 
advanced considerably our understanding of these 
ligands, their distribution and their role in ocean 
ecosystems. 
 
Carbon flux  
 
It is this imbalance in the community structure 
which gives rise to the geochemical signal.  
Whereas iron stimulation of the smaller members 
of the communtures, such as an increased 
production of dimethylsulfionproprionate (DMSP) 
occurs (Turner et al., 1996), it is the stimulation of 
the larger producers which decouples the large cell 
producers from grazing and results in a net uptake 
and export of nitrate, CO
2
 and silicate.  The extent 
to which this imbalance results in carbon flux, 
however, has yet to be adequately constrained.  
This has been primarily a problem of experimental 
scale.  Even though mesoscale experiments have, 
for the first time, given us the ability to address the 
effect of iron on communities, the products of 
surface water processes have been difficult to track.  
For instance, on the IronEx II experiment, a time 
series of the enriched patch was diluted by 40% per 
day and is described by Nightingale et al. (2000).  
The dilution was primarily in a lateral 
(horizontal/isopycnal) dimension.  Although some 
correction for lateral dilution can be made, our 
ability to quantify carbon export is dependent upon 
the measurement of a signal in waters below the 
mixed layer, or from an uneroded enriched patch. 
Current data from the equatorial Pacific showed 
that the IronEx II experiment advected over six 
patch diameters per day.  This means that at no time 
during the experiment were the products of 
increased export reflected in the waters below the 
enriched area.  Our results from the equatorial 
Pacific, when corrected for dilution, suggest that 
about 2,500 tons of carbon were exported from the 
mixed layer over a 7-day period.  These results are 
preliminary and subject to more rigorous estimates 
of dilution and export production, but they do agree 
favorably with estimates based upon both carbon 
and nitrogen budgets. 
 
Experimental scale 
 
Given these considerations, the most feasible way 
to understand and quantify carbon export from an 
enriched water mass is to increase the scale of the 
experiment such that both lateral dilution and 
sub-mixed layer relative advection is small with 
respect to the size of the enriched patch.  For areas 
such as the equatorial Pacific, this would be very 
large (100s of kilometers on a side).  For other areas, 
this could be much smaller.  From the acoustic 
Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data presented, it 
appears that lateral advection was not as much of a 
problem during SOIREE as during the IronEx 
experiments.  The relative advection of the 
enriched patch over the underlying waters will be a 
function of wind stress and regional 
hydrodynamics.  In the subarctic Pacific, this can 
be severe.  It is this author’s opinion that an 
uncontained enrichment experiment in this region 
should be large (1000 km
2
 or greater) to avoid 
lateral mixing and slippage relative to the 
sub-mixed layer. 
  
What we need to know 
 
There are a multitude of questions remaining 
regarding the role of iron in shaping the nature of 
the pelagic community.  Some of these topics 
involve the role of the heterotrophic bacterial 
community in cycling iron and carbon, the extent to 
which the smaller phytoplankton contribute to flux, 
the partitioning of light isotopes of carbon and 
nitrogen in biomarker compounds and in the bulk 
plankton and their use in establishing 
paleo-isotopic tracers of growth rate and trophic 
structure, the use of single cell FRR fluorometry to 
study species specific response to iron, the use of 
sediment traps and radioisotopic disequilibrium to 
measure and infer carbon export.  Many of the 
remaining questions will be the subject of the 
CARUSO and SOFeX experiments as well as 
future experiments in the subarctic Pacific.  The 
focus of the IronEx and SOFeX experiments has 
been from the scientific perspective, but this focus 
is shifting towards the application of iron 
enrichment as a carbon sequestration strategy.  We 
have come about rapidly from the perspective of 
trying to understand how the world works, to one of 
trying to make the world work for us.  
 
77 
 Several basic questions remain regarding the role 
of natural or anthropogenic iron fertilization on 
carbon export.  Some of the most pressing 
questions are: What are the best proxies for carbon 
export? How can carbon export best be verified? 
What are the long term ecological consequences of 
iron enrichment on: (1) surface water community 
structure? (2) midwater processes? (3) benthic 
processes? And what is the response of the 
community structure and biological pump to iron 
enrichment in low nutrient low chlorophyll 
(LNLC) systems where nitrogen fixation may be 
iron limited?  Even with these answers, there are 
others which would need to be addressed prior to 
any serious consideration of iron fertilization as an 
ocean carbon sequestration option (see below). 
 
Technology 
 
Simple technology is sufficient to produce a 
massive bloom.  The technology required for either 
a large-scale enrichment experiment or for 
purposful attempts to sequester carbon, is readily 
available.  Ships, aircraft (tankers and research 
platforms), tracer technology, a broad range of new 
AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles) and 
instrument packages, Lagrangian buoy tracking 
systems, together with aircraft and satellite remote 
sensing systems and a new suite of chemical 
sensors/in situ detection technologies are all 
available, or are being developed at this time.    The 
big questions, however, are larger than the 
technology. 
 
Resources 
 
With a slow start, the notion of both scientific 
experimentation through manipulative experiments, 
as well as the use of iron to purposefully sequester 
carbon, is gaining momentum.  There are now 
national, international, industrial, and scientific 
concerns willing to support larger-scale 
experiments.  The materials required for such an 
experiment are inexpensive and readily available 
even as industrial byproducts (paper, mining, steel 
processing). 
 
Feasibility 
 
Given the concern over climate change and the 
rapid modernization of large underdeveloped 
countries (China, India, etc.), there is a pressing 
need to address the increased emission of 
greenhouse gasses.  Through the implementation of 
the Kyoto accords or other international 
agreements to curb emissions (Rio), financial 
incentives will reach into the multi-billion dollar 
level annually.  Certainly there will soon be an 
overwhelming fiscal incentive to investigate, if not 
implement purposeful open ocean carbon 
sequestration trials. 
  
Questions 
 
The question is not whether we have the capability 
of embarking upon such an engineering strategy, 
the question is whether we have the collective 
wisdom to responsibly negotiate such a course of 
action.  Posed another way: If we do not have the 
social, political and economic tools or motivation 
to control our own population and greenhouse gas 
emissions, what gives us the confidence that we 
have the wisdom and ability to responsibly 
manipulate and control large ocean ecosystems 
without propagating yet another massive 
environmental calamity? Have we, as an 
international community, first tackled the difficult 
but obvious problem of overpopulation and 
implemented alternative energy technologies for 
transportation, industry and domestic use? 
 
There are other social questions which arise as well, 
such as:  Is it appropriate to use the ocean commons 
for such a purpose?  What individuals, companies 
or countries would derive monetary compensation 
for such an effort and how would this be decided? 
 
It is clear that there are major science investigations 
and findings which can only benefit from 
large-scale open ocean enrichment experiments, 
but certainly a large-scale carbon sequestration 
effort should not proceed without a clear 
understanding of both the science and the answers 
to the questions above.

Introduction 
 
The role of iron in limiting oceanic productivity 
and influencing community structure has been 
demonstrated for the high nitrate, low chlorophyll 
(HNLC) waters of the subarctic Pacific, equatorial 
Pacific, the Southern Ocean, and even some coastal 
upwelling regimes.  As a consequence, iron has 
been elevated to the same status as nitrogen, 
phosphorus and silicon as important nutrients 
influencing global biogeochemical cycles.  In 
oceanic surface waters, concentrations of dissolved 
iron (defined as the iron concentration in the filtrate 
passing through a conventional 0.2 or 0.4µm filter) 
commonly range from 0.02 nM (20 pM) to 1 nM.  
In remote HNLC regimes (such as the equatorial 
Pacific, subarctic Pacific, and parts of the Southern 
Ocean) iron can be a limiting nutrient with 
dissolved iron concentrations in surface waters on 
the order of 0.02 to 0.05 nM (20 to 50 pM).  These 
concentrations are low enough for dissolved iron to 
be diffusion limiting with respect to growth rates 
for all but the smallest phytoplankton cells (Hudson 
and Morel, 1990; Sunda and Huntsman, 1995).  
Measurements of total dissolved iron 
concentrations alone, however, are insufficient for 
understanding the accessibility of iron to 
phytoplankton.  Knowledge of the chemical 
speciation of iron is critical for examining the 
mechanisms by which phytoplankton are fulfilling 
their iron requirements and is important for 
addressing the question of how the lack of iron 
limits phytoplankton productivity in certain regions 
of the oceans. 
 
Discussion 
 
The majority of this dissolved iron in remote 
low-iron, HNLC regimes appears to be chelated (as 
FeLi) with organic ligands (Li) which resemble 
siderophores in their conditional stability constants 
and molecular weight (Rue and Bruland, 1997).  In 
HNLC areas such as the equatorial Pacific, it 
appears that these chelated forms of iron are 
primarily less than 1000 in relative molar mass 
(molecular weight) (Rue and Bruland, 1997), with 
only a small fraction existing as larger, colloidal 
size material.  In these low-iron waters, both Li and 
FeLi appear to exist primarily in the soluble 
fraction and colloidal forms do not appear to be a 
significant fraction of the dissolved iron.  Results 
on the chemical speciation of iron in central gyre 
regions of the North Pacific and North Atlantic 
both indicate that the bulk of the dissolved iron 
exists as organic Fe(III)-chelates (Rue and Bruland, 
1995; Wu and Luther, 1995).  Even though the data 
are very limited, it even appears that iron in the 
deep ocean exists primarily as Fe(III)-chelates (Rue 
and Bruland, 1995; Nolting et al., 1998) although it 
is uncertain to what extent the iron is soluble or 
colloidal in form.  The higher concentrations of 
dissolved iron in coastal waters also appear to be 
associated with organic ligands (Gledhill and van 
den Berg, 1994; van den Berg, l995).  In contrast to 
the low-iron open ocean, however, the high-iron 
Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island, United States) has 
the bulk of what seems to be organically complexed 
dissolved iron existing as a colloidal Fe fraction, 
with only a small amount found in the relative 
molar mass <1000 ultrafiltrate (Rue and Bruland, 
pers. comm.).  Powell et al. (1996) used 
ultrafiltration to carry out a size-fractionation study 
of dissolved iron and dissolved organic carbon in 
the Ochlockonee estuary (Florida, United States).  
They showed that in high-iron, low-salinity regions 
of the estuary the vast majority of iron was in the 
high molecular weight fraction (relative molar 
mass >10,000), but that this component was only a 
minimal fraction in higher salinity regions.  Thus, 
the chemical form of dissolved iron appears to 
change dramatically from being primarily 
associated with a complex, higher molecular 
weight, colloidal fraction in estuarine and fresh 
waters, to being in the form of low molecular 
weight, water soluble, strong Fe(III)-organic 
chelates in oceanic surface waters. 
 
Although the identity, origin, and chemical 
characteristics of these organic compounds are 
largely unknown, it has been implied that some 
80 
component of these natural ligands are 
siderophores (Rue and Bruland, 1995).  Macrellis 
et al. (2001) report the first direct evidence from 
natural seawater to support this theory.  Large 
volume seawater collection and solid phase 
extraction employing Biobeads SM-2 and 
Amberlite XAD-16 resins were conducted in the 
California coastal upwelling system. 
Electrochemical analyses using competitive ligand 
equilibration/adsorptive cathodic stripping 
voltammetry (CLE-ACSV) showed that extracted 
groups of compounds had conditional iron-binding 
affinities (with respect to Fe') of K
cond

, identical to those constants 
measured for purified marine siderophores 
produced in laboratory cultures.  In addition, 63% 
of the extracted compounds fall within the defined 
size range of siderophores (300–1000 Daltons). 
Hydroxamate or catecholate iron-binding 
functional groups were responsible for iron 
complexation in all isolated extracts, illustrating 
that the functional groups previously shown to be 
active in marine and terrestrial siderophores 
extracted and purified from laboratory cultures are 
active in a natural marine community milieu.  Thus, 
these data provide the first evidence from natural 
marine systems that a significant fraction of the 
organic iron-binding compounds that control the 
availability of iron and therefore, influence the 
global biogeochemical cycling of this 
micronutrient, are biologically produced 
siderophores. 
 
Much of the current interest in the marine 
chemistry of iron stems from its role as a limiting 
micronutrient affecting plankton productivity and 
biological species composition.  The high degree of 
organic complexation of iron makes it critically 
important to re-evaluate our perceptions of the 
marine biogeochemistry of iron and the 
mechanisms by which biota can access this 
chelated iron. Trace metal assimilation by 
phytoplankton has historically been modeled using 
the free ion concentration (or activity) model 
(Morel and Hering, 1993), with iron uptake by 
phytoplankton typically correlated with free, 
hydrated Fe
3+
 concentrations (using EDTA buffered 
solutions).  It is now realized, however, that it is the 
far more abundant, kinetically labile, hydrolysis 
species comprising Fe(III)' (such as Fe(OH)
2+
) that 
actually control uptake rates of inorganic iron 
(Hudson and Morel, 1990; Hudson, 1998).  As a 
result, recent papers dealing with iron limitation in 
laboratory culture media correlate effects with 
[Fe(III)'] rather than [Fe
3+
] (Sunda and Huntsman, 
1995). 
 
A recent example (Rue and Bruland, 1997) of an 
iron speciation study in a low-iron HNLC area was 
performed as part of the IronEx II mesoscale iron 
addition experiment (Coale et al., 1996).  Rue and 
Bruland (1997) observed two classes of 
Fe(III)-binding organic ligands: a strong ligand 
class (L1) with a conditional stability constant 
K

FeL1,Fe(III)'

 and a mean 
concentration of 310 pM, and a weaker class (L2)

FeL2,Fe(III)'

 and a mean concentration of  
190 pM.  The total Fe(III)-binding organic ligand 
concentrations were ~25 times higher than total 
dissolved iron concentrations of only 20 pM. 
Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations suggest 
that 99.9% of the ambient dissolved Fe(III) would 
be complexed with these organic ligands and 
results from ultra filtration experiments indicated 
that they exist as low molecular weight Fe(Ill) 
chelates.  Upon the initial mesoscale iron injection 
of ~2nM, the total iron-binding ligand 
concentration increased by 400% to 2 nM within a 
day.  Most of this increase was due to the stronger 
ligand class, L1, which increased from 0.3 to  
1.3 nM.  Results obtained from samples collected 
throughout the entire course of the iron enrichment 
experiments suggest that these iron-binding organic 
ligands are produced rapidly in response to small 
iron additions to this low-iron regime.  The 
chelated iron appears to somehow be directly or 
indirectly accessible for growth.  The presence of 
these chelators causes the labile inorganic species 
(Fe(III)') to exist at extremely low concentrations, 
perhaps requiring photochemical or other redox 
mechanisms to provide an adequate supply of Fe' 
(Rue and Bruland, 1997; Price and Morel, 1998). 
At this point, we are just beginning to understand 
how chelated iron might be accessible by the 
biological community (Maldonado and Price, 1999, 
2000; Wells and Trick, 2004).  Prokaryotes and 
even unicellular eukaryotes, such as diatoms, 
appear to be able to utilize some of the chelated iron 
(Price et al., 1994; Price and Morel, 1998; Hutchins 
et al., 1998, 1999).  There are suggestions that 
eukaryotic phytoplankton, such as diatoms, can 
access this chelated Fe(III) by using cell 
surface-bound reductases to reduce the chelated 
Fe(III) to Fe(II) which then dissociates and is 
subsequently assimilated either as Fe(II)' or, after 
 
81 
re-oxidation, as Fe(Ill)' (Maldonado and Price, 
1999).  There are some data to suggest that the 
protozoan grazers of the microbial community can 
utilize and solubilize colloidal iron (Barbeau et al., 
1996), and there is also evidence that particulate 
iron associated with the plankton community can 
be remineralized and reused as regenerated iron 
much in the same way as nitrogen is recycled 
(Hutchins et al., 1993; Hutchins and Bruland, 
1994).  Price and Morel (1998) estimated that 83% 
of the iron uptake by microorganisms within the 
euphotic zone of the equatorial Pacific was from 
such biological regeneration, while the remaining 
17% was supplied from external sources such as 
eolian deposition and upwelling.  In addition, it has 
been suggested that various members of the 
phytoplankton and microplankton community can 
utilize phagocytosis to engulf and partially digest 
particulate iron (Raven, 1997), thereby rendering a 
fraction of the particulate iron available over an 
extended time scale.  Recent evidence suggests that 
the photosynthetic phytoplankton Ochromonas can 
obtain iron directly in particulate form by ingesting 
bacteria (Maranger et al., 1998). As a result of the 
diversity of iron uptake strategies employed by 
various marine microorganisms, some of the 
“non-available” iron is likely recycled by various 
mechanisms and at various rates into biologically 
available forms (Wells and Mayer, 1991; Wells et 
al., 1995).  Therefore, most of the dissolved iron 
and part of the particulate iron may eventually be 
made available to the plankton community. 
 
Conclusions 
 
Addressing the processes responsible for the role of 
iron forces us to look more closely at its marine 
chemistry.  The majority of dissolved iron exists as 
Fe(III)-chelates with relatively specific and strong 
Fe(III)-binding ligands.  Results from iron 
fertilization experiments have raised a number of 
questions that point to the need for more research. 
What are these iron-binding ligands?  Are the 
stronger class of ligands, apparently produced in 
rapid response to increased iron levels, 
siderophores? Are they inducible, excreted, and 
regulated? What about the weaker class of ligands? 
Are these simply photochemical degradation 
products or cell lysis products (from zooplankton 
grazing or viral lysing) containing porphyrin 
groups such as those in cytochromes, chlorophylls, 
and haem proteins? Very little information exists, 
however, as to the chemical nature of these 
iron-binding ligands or the mechanisms involved in 
their production, function or fate.  The need for 
future research elucidating the molecular structure 
and character of the strong iron-binding ligands 
observed in seawater has been recognized and has 
begun.  In addition, research into the biological 
availability of the various chelated forms of iron, 
and the mechanisms various microorganisms 
utilize to access these iron species, will continue to 
be a research area of great importance in the next 
decade.

Abstract 
 
Laboratory and shipboard “grow-out” experiments 
have provided the foundation of our understanding 
of how different members of the phytoplankton 
community access “free iron” versus iron bound in 
natural or artificial ligands. While the 
mechanism(s) is not fully established, these 
laboratory and natural population experiments have 
provided insights into how different members of a 
community compete for iron supplied either as a 
xenosiderophore–iron complex or as a ligand–iron 
complex.  We make the distinction between known 
siderophores added to the system (xeno- 
siderophores, in this case) and the natural ligands 
that have been isolated and/or described by the van 
den Berg and Rue/Bruland research groups. To 
investigate the role of each of these iron–organic 
complexes on the shaping of the phytoplankton 
community, natural populations were exposed to 
increasing levels of organic iron complexing agents 
during three recent cruises.  The growth and 
composition of the population were monitored to 
assess the impact of individual ligands on the 
eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities.  Flow 
cytometric analysis offered unique insights into the 
effects of a range of levels of available iron on the 
phytoplankton community from contrasting 
oceanographic regimes, including high nutrient, 
low chlorophyll (HNLC) areas and the oligotropbic 
central gyres. 
 
Introduction 
 
There are two dichotomies that must be considered 
when evaluating the methods by which natural 
phytoplankton communities acquire iron.  First, 
there is a dichotomy on how we view the different 
population “adaptations”.  Second, how do we view 
the source material — the form of iron? The most 
important question in assessing the relationship 
between the cellular physiological processes with 
the ecological processes is based on how we 
combine these two dichotomies. 
 
In the traditional cellular view, the accessibility of 
specific forms of iron is different between the two 
most prominently discussed groups of 
phytoplankton: the cyanobacteria and the diatoms. 
Considerable research on the iron acquisition 
system by diatoms clearly indicates that the prime 
form of available iron is that of the free ionic form 
(often referred to as Fe').  When physiologically 
available forms of iron are reduced to a specific 
level, the cell accommodates with alterations in the 
cell quota for iron (by altering the cellular 
composition: reduction in the iron demands in the 
photosystem (ferridoxin:flavodoxin), reducing the 
demands for iron in chlorophyll biosynthesis, 
perhaps reducing the iron demands for nitrate 
acquisition).  All of these changes occur in direct 
response to the level of Fe'. 
 
In contrast, the physiological status of 
cyanobacteria is equally dependent on the 
availability of free inonrganic iron (Fe') until the 
levels of iron are reduced significantly to induce the 
low-iron physiology of these cells.  The low-iron 
physiological state induces a slight reduction in the 
iron quota of the cell, but the magnitude of the 
change is not as pronounced as in the diatom model.  
The primary alteration in cell physiology when Fe' 
is low is the induction (through depression) of the 
high-affinity iron acquisition system.  This system 
is a two (or more) part acquisition system 
comprising of an extracellular-released iron 
binding ligand (termed: siderophore) and the 
equally specific iron–ligand membrane receptor for 
the transport of the ligand-bound iron. 
 
From the cellular perspective, we can refer to these 
as the FIT (Free Iron Transport) model and the LIT 
(Ligand Iron Transport) model and we note that our 
view of iron availability in the oceans in many 
ways now parallels these two models.  Rue and 
Bruland (this workshop) have just outlined the 
importance of the naturally formed ligands in 
marine waters in comparison with the level of 
newly advected or introduced iron within an 
ecosystem.  Thus, how iron is provided in an 
84 
ecosystem is the next dichotomy:  some systems are 
dominated by “fresh” inorganic iron (paralleling 
the FIT model) whereas others have significant 
levels of natural ligand binding the iron (paralleling 
the LIT model).  The origin of this natural ligand 
remains unknown but appears to be a collection of 
potentially active compounds (Macrelis et al., 
2001). 
 
In this presentation I would like to propose whether 
we are accurate in implying the ecological and 
physiological descriptions of the FIT and LIT 
models hold true, based on our laboratory and 
shipboard grow-out experiments.  For this 
presentation I will limit myself to the use of the 
addition of artificial ligands.  In this case, the 
artificial ligands are siderophores produced by, and 
isolated from, microorganisms other than the ones 
we are studying in these experiments.  I will use the 
term “xenosiderophore” to denote these ligands 
since they are produced in response to iron stress by 
the host cell (“siderophore”) that is foreign 
(“xeno”) to the ecosystem.  I will consider the 
influence of two xenosiderophores on four 
phytoplankton cultures and on natural communities 
from a HNLC region of the Eastern Pacific Ocean. 
 
Materials and methods 
 
Laboratory experiments   
 
Experiments were performed in the laboratory 
using the following cultures: Synechococcus sp. 
PCC7002, Talassiosira weissflogii CCMP1051, 
Heterosigma akashiwo NEPCC560R, and H. 
akashiwo NEPCC764R.  All cells were maintained 
in four separate modifications of artificial seawater 
(ASM) (Harrison et al., 1980) supplemented with 
f/2 nutrients, metals (except iron) and vitamins. 
Cells were maintained at four different levels of 
iron ranging from 0.1 μM to 1 μM.  Cells were 
grown at l8ºC under continuous light flux of 65–80 
µmol photons m
–2 
s
–1
. 
    
The batch culture experiments of 50 mL cultures 
were prepared in 250 mL acid-washed Erlenmeyer 
flasks.  Cultures were preconditioned in the 
appropriate medium using the stock culture 
maintained at the nearest iron concentration.  All 
media contained 1 μM FeCl
3
 plus the indicated 
level of either desferal or rhodotorulic acid (Sigma).  
The induction of iron stress was monitored using 
 
F
v
/F
m
 measurements of photosynthetic efficiency 
(for diatom and flagellate) cultures or chlorophyll/ 
zeaxanthin levels for the cyanobacterium.  Cell 
densities were monitored at intervals of 6 to 8 h 
with a Neurembauer hemocytometer and regression 
analysis of the experimental growth phase was used 
to calculate the growth rates. 
    
Iron uptake rates were performed using 72 h old 
cultures, spiked with 2 nM 
59
FeCl
3
.  Cells were 
allowed to accumulate the radiotracer and 
sub-fractions harvested at 2, 4, 6 and 24 h. Titanium 
chloride-EDTA was used to remove unincorporated 
isotopes. Rates of iron accumulation were 
calculated using the linear portion of isotope 
burden versus time.  
 
Field-based sampling  
 
Sampling sites were located off the shelf break on a 
transect between the Galapagos Islands and the 
western coast of Peru.  All sample water was 
collected by pumping from surface waters using an 
all plastic, trace metal clean system.  Water for the 
bioassay experiments was drawn from nutrient- 
replete waters having comparatively 
moderate-to-low iron concentrations.  Seawater 
was pumped through the system for several hours 
to rinse the tubing and pump assembly before 
collecting a homogenized surface (5 m) sample in a 
50 L acid-cleaned polyethylene carboy. 
    
The homogenized surface sample without filtration 
was distributed into 1000 mL polycarbonate bottles 
and specific quantities of artificial ligand (Desferal 
(DFB) or rhodotorulic acid (RA)) or iron (as FeCl
3
). 
Triplicate bottles were prepared for daily sampling. 
Amended cultures were immediately placed in an 
on-deck, flowing seawater incubator.  At the 
appropriate intervals, bottles were cleanly sampled 
for nutrients, viruses, bacteria and phytoplankton. 
Phytoplankton communities were analyzed 
immediately, without initial preservation, using a 
Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer 
equipped with a low argon laser and CellQuest 
software.  In order to normalize the spectrum of cell 
responses, the software was calibrated using the 
following:  1, 2, 4, 10, 16 µm non-fluorescent beads 
for cell size based calibration and 10 µm 
fluorescent beads to standardized fluorescence 
corresponding to chlorophyll and phycocyanin. 
 
85 
Results 
 
The yield and growth rate of each of the cultures 
was influenced by the total amount of iron in the 
medium (Fig. 1).  The yield of all the cultures, 
except the diatom, were maximal when total iron 
added was greater than 10
–6
 M, but higher 
concentrations were required to achieve maximum 
yield in the diatom culture.  As iron levels in the 
medium were reduced, the yield of the two 
flagellate cultures dropped quickly with little 
accumulated biomass when iron levels were less 
than 10
–7
 M.  These flagellates did show an initial 
but unsustainable growth rate at these low iron 
levels, indicating that the low level of yield was a 
function of satiating the iron requirement of the 
cells, and not an issue of diffusion limitation. 
 
The cyanobacterium and the diatom cultures 
contrast the growth kinetics of the two flagellates. 
In the case of the cyanobacterium, there was a rapid 
loss of cell yield and growth rate with a reduction of 
iron in the medium.  The diatom culture remained 
active in growth and in the acquisition of iron 
throughout the different levels of iron, indicating 
that either more “available” iron was available for 
this cell or that the quota of this cell was 
considerably more “plastic” than the other cultures 
and the cell could maintain a growth rate at low iron 
concentrations. 
    
If DFB was added to artificially reduce the level of 
“available” iron in the culture, the cells behaved 
differently than if the inorganic iron alone was 
reduced (Fig. 2).  The flagellate strains had a more 
effective ability to remove iron from the complex 
than the cyanobacterium, whereas the diatom 
obtained sufficient iron for growth over the entire 
chelation range, even though the rate of iron 
transport was dramatically reduced (Fig. 3).

xenosiderophore in the laboratory flask.  Iron adsorbed to the cells was removed using the Ti-citrate wash. 
 
 
Contrasting the addition of DFB to chelate the 
available iron, the addition of RA was stimulatory 
to the cyanobacterium and the diatom, while being 
as limiting to the two flagellates as the addition of 
the DFB (Fig. 4). 
 
The addition of DFB to the natural population from 
the HNLC region southeast of the Galapagos 
Islands almost completely reduced the ability of the 
population to transform the available nutrients in 
the water mass.  The water contained ~12 nM 
nitrate, ~9 nM silicate, and ~1.5 nM of phosphate. 
With the addition of iron to the sample, the final 
yield of the grow-out experiments was stimulated 
proportional to the amount of iron added.  This 
stimulation only lasted for 3 days as the system was 
modified by grazers after Day 3 (Fig. 5).

) and (B) DFB to chelate

88 
The yield was proportional to the level of available 
iron in the system (Fig. 5B) but not all cells 
responded identically to the addition or removal of 
iron (Fig. 6).  Figure 7 illustrates the response of 
four different types of photosynthetic organisms in 
the grow-out bioassays.  In general, all the cells 
grew in response to the level of predictable iron, 
with the dramatic exception of the nanoeukaryotic 
cells (5–20 μm cells).  These cells could compete 
for the available nutrients at low concentrations as 
the other cells were suitably inhibited by the lack of 
available iron.  The nanoflagellates were growing 
in the low-iron waters in spite of having a dramatic 
reduction in the amount of chlorophyll per cell  
(Fig. 8).

Discussion and conclusions 
    
The importance of siderophores in cyanobacteria 
and the lack of extracellular “siderophores” from 
diatoms have created an artificial and unwelcome 
view of how iron is shared among members of the 
photosynthetic community.  There are several 
points to bring forward: 
 
1. Cyanobacteria are excellent producers of 
siderophores, and these may be the source of 
the natural ligand.  But in non-marine systems, 
eukaryotes such as fungi, yeasts, and protests 
(photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic) are all 
active producers of iron-binding ligands (some 
of which have the low-iron inducible 
ligand–iron transport system and are thus 
“siderophores”; others are iron-binding 
“ligands”).  Production of natural ligands by 
eukaryotic microorganisms remains 
under-appreciated. 
2. Production of ligands from heterotrophic 
bacteria remains a possibility.  While recent 
papers have indicated that carbon limitation 
remains the primary controlling factor even in 
HNLC regions, work by Price and by Cochlan 
(later in the workshop) should provide a new 
insight. 
3. Field and laboratory observations indicate that 
cyanobacteria perform somewhat better than 
the larger eukaryotes when the 
xenosiderophore concentration is only in slight 
excess to the available iron.  The growth of 
larger eukaryotes is very sensitive to the 
availability of the free iron in the system and 
there is no indication that any ability to obtain 
iron from the xenosiderophore–iron complex 
results in a competitive advantage of the cells. 
4. The group that fills the void when the free iron 
levels drop and the ligand concentration 
increases over the natural levels of iron is the 
“nanoeukaryotes”. 
 
The reason for this dominance is not known at 
present but we could ask the simple question: Is it 
because they are “nano” or is it because they are 
mostly flagellates? We can pose several 
mechanisms.  First, like many of the other 
photosynthetic protists, the photosynthetic system 
is reduced at higher ligand:iron concentrations.  
This is evident in chlorophyll/cell and parameters 
of photosynthetic efficacy.  Since many of the 
observed cells are flagellates without predominant 
coccoliths (Phaeocystis, small dinoflagellates, etc.), 
iron acquisition through phagotrophy is a 
90 
possibility, thus circumventing the FIT/LIT model 
for the origin of available iron.  Alternatively, there 
have been reports to suggest that the adsorption of 
small colloids to the complex surface of some 
flagellates will allow for a semi-portable iron pool, 
accessed through membrane-based reduction 
physiologies.  If we can use our understanding from 
studies on coastal flagellates as examples, we 
conclude that the flagellates may have a higher 
level of adsorbed iron to the cell surface and a 
means to solubilize and utilize this iron pool.

Introduction 
 
The HNLC (high nutrient, low chlorophyll) regions 
account for approximately 30% of the ocean, of 
which the Southern Ocean occupies the largest 
surface area and represents the largest repository of 
excess nutrients.  The role of iron as a limiting 
micronutrient of phytoplankton growth was 
suggested as early as the 1930s (see de Baar, 1994).  
Dissolved iron levels at sub-nanomolar 
concentrations and increases in phytoplankton 
biomass in response to iron addition have been 
confirmed for Southern Ocean waters (Martin et 
al., 1990a,b), and circumstantial evidence of 
iron-limited phytoplankton growth has been 
obtained in the Polar Front (PF) region (de Baar et 
al., 1995).  However, extrapolation from in vivo 
experiments is limited, due to the exclusion of 
grazing and physical controls (Banse, 1991), and 
causality in observational studies is difficult to 
prove.  An alternative approach to establishing the 
relationship between iron supply and 
phytoplankton growth was achieved by mesoscale 
iron enrichment of surface waters in the equatorial 
Pacific (IronEx I), with tracking of the fertilised 
waters using a conservative tracer, sulphur 
hexafluoride (Martin et al., 1994; Law et al., 1998). 
A second study, IronEx II, unequivocally 
confirmed iron limitation in this region, with 
increased iron availability stimulating 
phytoplankton growth biomass and production 
despite increased grazing (Coale et al., 1996). 
Macronutrient concentrations declined in 
association with a drawdown of surface pCO
2
 as 
inorganic carbon was fixed by the phytoplankton 
(Cooper et al., 1996). 
 
These observations lent support to the “iron 
hypothesis” (Martin, 1990) that iron-mediated 
increases in export production may influence 
atmospheric CO
2
.  Yet, despite the 90-µatm 
decrease in surface CO
2
 during IronEx II, the 
equatorial Pacific is not considered an important 
region for iron-mediated carbon sequestration, due 
to its limited capacity for transfer of fixed carbon 
into the deep ocean (Sarmiento and Orr, 1991). 
Instead, the Southern Ocean is considered to have 
the greatest potential to influence the oceanic CO
2 
sink, due to the significant deep-water formation in 
this region.  Indeed, 3-D ocean models predict that 
whatever limits nutrient uptake in the Southern 
Ocean constrains global atmospheric CO
2
 on 
timescales of hundreds of years, with complete 
nutrient utilisation potentially resulting in a 6–21% 
decline in atmospheric CO
2 
(Sarmiento and Orr, 
1991). 
 
However
, 
the results of IronEx II cannot be 
extrapolated to the Southern Ocean, as factors such 
as light limitation (Sunda and Huntsman, 1997), 
co-limitation of diatoms by silicate availability 
(Boyd et al., 1999), and reduced physiological 
growth rates at lower temperatures may complicate 
the response to increased iron availability. Similarly, 
the response of biogeochemical cycling in the 
surface mixed layer to iron enrichment cannot be 
extrapolated from in vivo studies.  Modelling 
simulations (Sarmiento and Orr, 1991) predict that 
iron enrichment would result in the complete 
utilisation of surface ocean macronutrients, yet 
significant variation has been observed in in vitro 
iron enrichments (de Baar and Boyd, 1999)
 
and the 
open Southern Ocean (Comiso et al., 1993; Moore 
et al., 1999).  The results of IronEx II confirmed the 
requirement for an in situ iron fertilisation 
experiment in open Southern Ocean waters to 
address the controls of the magnitude of 
phytoplankton stocks and the implications for 
atmospheric CO
2
.  The following discussion 
describes the results of the Southern Ocean IRon 
Enrichment Experiment (SOIREE) which took 
place in February 1999 in the Austalasian sector of 
the Southern Ocean.

Methods 
 
Site selection 
 
Executing an in situ experiment, with the 
requirement to create and track a coherent body of 
surface water over a 2-week period was logistically 
and scientifically challenging in the dynamic 
environment of the Southern Ocean.  Site selection 
for the experiment was critical to the success of the 
experiment and subsequent extrapolation of the 
dataset, and so site criteria were identified.  The site 
had to be representative of a broad region of 
circumpolar HNLC waters, but with low current 
shear to maximise the timescale of patch tracking.  
The depth of the surface mixed layer had been 
regionally representative (see Fig. 1), but shallow 
enough to avoid iron/light co-limitation (Sunda and 
Huntsman, 1997), or over-dilution of the iron/SF
6
.  
The pre-cruise desktop survey of bathymetry, sea 
surface temperature, mean mixed layer depth, wind 
speed, buoy drift trajectories from climatological 
datasets of WOA (World Ocean Atlas), JGOFS 
(Joint Global Ocean Flux Study) and satellite data, 
is described in Trull et al. (2001).  Two regions 
were initially identified (Fig. 1), with 61°S 141°E 
chosen as the favoured site, partly because it was 
bounded by two major survey transect lines — R/V 
Astrolab and WOCE SR3 — which provided 
information on the major features in this region.  
The site was considered to be dynamically more 
stable due to a widening between the Polar Front 
and the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current.  
The primary concern relating to the position of the 
site was the de-coupling of the silicate front from 
the Polar Front with the southerly migration of the 
former during summer.  Bottle experiments in 
HNLC regions, IronEx II and observations from the 
Polar Front all suggest that diatoms were most 
likely to respond to iron addition, and silicate 
availability was therefore an important 
consideration.  A 72-h pre-survey of the region 
confirmed that conditions were representative of 
polar open waters in summer (Table 1), and stable 
enough to initiate and maintain an iron-fertilised 
patch.

Release 
 
The release of 3.8 tonnes of acidified FeSO
4
 and 164 
g of tracer SF
6
 took place on February 9, 1999 over 
approximately 50 km
2
.  The release was achieved by 
an expanding hexagonal track in a Lagrangian 
frame of reference around a central drifter buoy 
which updated its position every 10 min, allowing 
correction for surface water advection. Subsequent 
iron additions were initiated in response to low 
dissolved iron levels in the surface waters of the 
patch.  The three subsequent infusions of iron on 
Days 3, 5 and 7 at the tracer patch centre were 
smaller (~1.6–1.8 tonnes) than the initial release and 
were not accompanied by SF
6
,
 
as the tracer signal 
remained high and the patch clearly defined 
throughout the experiment.

Results and discussion 
 
Tracer and iron distribution 
 
The patch drifted approximately 80 km 
east-southeast during the 13-day experiment and 
increased in surface area to 200–250 km
2
.  The 
tracer patch remained coherent throughout with the 
cross-patch width remaining constant at ~4–5 km 
and the along-patch length extending along its 
transit axis to ~30 km.  The coherence of the patch 
enabled identification of the patch centre and 
borders and so ease positioning of the IN and OUT 
stations for vertical hydrocasts.  The vertical 
structure of the patch did not vary significantly 
although transient structure developed within the 
65-m surface mixed layer in the latter part of the 
experiment in response to improved meteorological 
conditions.  
 
Iron was measured underway in surface waters and 
on vertical hydrocasts as dissolved iron (DFe – 
Fe(II) and Fe(III) that passed through a 0.2-μm 
filter) and total dissolvable iron (TFe) (Bowie et al., 
2001).  The mean DFe during the initial mapping 
was 2.8 nM, close to the predicted release 
concentration, and observed concentrations in the 
Polar Front region (de Baar et al., 1994).  DFe fell  
94 
to 0.3 nM within 2 days to background pre-infusion 
levels (0.2 nM) due to rapid oxidation to Fe(III) to 
oxyhydroxides and soft colloids with subsequent 
aggregation.  A similar trend was observed with the 
re-infusions, with DFe declining towards 
background levels, although TFe loss decreased 
prior to the final re-infusion on Day 7. After 
elevation to 2 nM on Day 7, DFe did not 
subsequently fall below 0.8 nM for the last 5 days 
of the experiment.  The persistence of the elevated 
DFe was surprising and it appears that slower 
precipitation of the insoluble Fe(III) in the colder 
water of the Southern Ocean, combined with 
increased potential for photoreduction of Fe(III) to 
Fe(II), contributed.  Furthermore, ~80% of the iron 
was in the reduced Fe(II) phase at the end of the 
experiment.  This may have been associated with a 
doubling in the concentration of the Fe(III) ligands 
which was observed after the final re-infusion 
(Boyd et al., 2000; Croot et al., 2001), leading to an 
increase in iron complexation capacity.  The results 
indicate that biological mechanisms maintained 
iron availability in the surface waters of the 
Southern Ocean, leading to the persistence of the 
bloom. 
 
Biological response  
 
The response to increased iron availability was 
significantly slower than in the IronEx studies.  
This was expected due to the lower physiological 
rates at lower temperatures and lower light 
availability in the deeper surface mixed layer.  The 
first biological response was recorded on Day 4 
with an increase in F
v
/F
m
 (see Fig. 2), a measure of 
the quantum efficiency of photosystem II and 
indicator of the general health of the phytoplankton 
(Boyd and Abraham, 2001).  From Day 4, there was 
a steady increase in surface F
v
/F
m
 during SOIREE, 
with an increase to the theoretical maximum of 
0.65 in the lower surface mixed layer.  Unlike 
IronEx II, there was no decrease in F
v
/F
m
 after the 
last iron infusion. 
 
This was followed by other physiological indictors, 
including decreases in iron stress (decreased 
flavodoxin expression) and decreased sinking rates 
(Boyd et al., 2000).  There was a 5-fold increase in 
Chlorophyll a (Chl-a), from 0.4 mg/m
3
 to 2 mg/m
3
 
by 13 days (Gall et al., 2001a,b), with an associated 
increase in column-integrated primary production 
from 0.2 g/m
2
/d to 1.5 g/m
2
/d.  This exceeded the 
increase in biomass observed during IronEx I, but 
was less than the 30-fold increase during the Ironex 
II study (Coale et al., 1996).  The elevated Chl-a 
concentrations observed were of similar magnitude 
to that associated with elevated iron concentrations 
in the Polar Front region (de Baar et al., 1995). 
C:chlorophyll ratios decreased from 90, prior to the 
experiment, to ~45 by Day 13, with phytoplankton 
carbon increasing by 3-fold.  Silicate utilisation in 
the presence of iron was more efficient, with Si:C 
uptake ratios decreasing from 0.17 in surrounding 
waters to 0.09 in the iron-enriched patch (Watson et 
al., 2000). 
 
The increase in chlorophyll was interpreted as an 
increase in chlorophyll per cell in the smaller size 
classes followed by floristic shifts with an increase 
in the number of large cells.  Size fractionation of 
the Chl-a confirms that the smaller groups 
responded first, possibly reflecting their capacity to 
sequester iron faster (Gall et al., 2001a). However, 
by Day 8 the smallest size fraction,  
<2 µm, crashed in response to an increase in 
zooplankton grazing (Hall and Safi, 2001). The 5- 
to 20-µm size class was dominated by the 
flagellates and increased around Day 7–8 and 
plateaued towards the end of the experiment.  The 
largest size class, consisting primarily of diatoms, 
dominated and accounted for 75% of primary 
production during the experiment.  The diatoms 
were predominately Fragilariopsis kerguelensis, a 
common Southern Ocean bloom-forming species 
with a high silicate requirement.  The increase 
observed in all size classes indicates that 
community structure was determined by iron 
availability, with dominance by the larger diatoms 
confirming previous observations. 
 
Biogeochemical response 
 
Macronutrient concentration did not exhibit a 
decrease until Day 5, with nitrate, phosphate and 
silicate decreasing by 3, 0.22 and 2.5 µM, 
respectively, by Day 13 (Boyd et al., 2000).  As in 
IronEx II, inorganic carbon uptake was significant 
with CO
2
 drawdown in the surface waters of the 
iron/tracer patch.  Continuous measurement of the 
surface fCO
2 
signal patch indicated a clear 
divergence between the iron-fertilised patch and 
surrounding waters with a small temperature- 
related increase in fCO
2
 outside the patch and a 
decrease of ~30 µatm inside (Watson et al., 
 
95 
 
Fig. 2 Biological and biogeochemical response to iron fertilisation during SOIREE (Boyd et al., 2000). 
96 
2000; see Fig. 3).  The drawdown of CO
2
 was 
similar in magnitude to that associated with 
elevated iron in the Polar Front (de Baar, 1994).  
DIC decreased by ~15–18 µmol/kg, consistent with 
the fCO
2
 and nitrate drawdown (Bakker et al., 
2001). 
 
The increase in phytoplankton production and a 
shift in community structure stimulated dimethyl 
suphide (DMS) production during IronEx II 
(Turner et al., 1996). DMS accounts for a 
significant proportion of the biogenic sulphur flux 
to the atmosphere, particularly in remote regions 
such as the Southern Ocean where it is oxidised to 
sulphate aerosols, and subsequently influences 
reflectance and cloud albedo (Charlson et al., 1987). 
DMS derives from the precursor dimethyl- 
sulfionproprionate (DMSP) which is an 
intracellular osmolyte used by certain species of 
phytoplankton.  During SOIREE, particulate 
DMSP increased to Day 8–9, and then declined, 
mirroring the 5- to 20-µm phytoplankton size 
fraction, and suggesting that the primary source of 
DMSP was the flagellates.  DMS levels increased 
from Day 7, coincident with increased herbivory by 
the microzooplankton, and were still increasing on 
Day 13.  It is speculative as to whether the DMS 
would have continued to increase, as diatoms are 
not generally regarded as significant sources of 
DMSP. The DMS increase observed during 
SOIREE was greater than that of IronEx II (7-fold 
compared with 3-fold compared with initial DMS 
concentrations, Turner et al., 2004).  The SOIREE 
results support the contention that an increase in 
iron flux to the Southern Ocean could stimulate 
DMS flux and impact atmospheric albedo in this 
region. 
 
The results indicated potential for enhanced export 
into the deep ocean, with an increase in the 
biological pump.  However, the phytoplankton 
were relatively healthy on departure (Boyd et al., 
2000), and the mesozooplankton response to the 
increased phytoplankton biomass was limited 
(Zeldis, 2001).  The latter may be attributable to the 
heavily silicified F. kergulensis. Thorium-234 
measurements, particulate organic carbon, and 
biogenic silicate collection in free-drifting 
sediment traps at 100 m all suggested that no 
significant export occurred during the 13-day 
experiment (Charette and Buessler, 2000; Nodder 
et al., 2001).  The accumulation of algal carbon 
(~4.1 g C/m
2
) accounted for ~70% of iron-mediated 
algal C fixation (6.1 g C/m
2
).  However, there was 
evidence of increasing iron stress, aggregation and 
sinking rates towards the end of the experiment 
(Boyd et al., 2000).

Bakker et al. (2001) estimate that an additional 
1350 tonnes of carbon would be transported into 
ocean interior on subduction, although Trull et al. 
(2001) suggest that subduction in this region would 
be unlikely.  The persistence of the bloom, as 
evidenced by elevated Chl-a levels in satellite 
images of the region, confirm that subduction did 
not occur, and suggests that export was not 
significant for the 6- to 7-week period following 
SOIREE (Abraham et al., 2000).  An elliptical 
feature of length ~150 km and surface area  
~100 km
2
 was observed with Chl-a levels 
exceeding 3 mg/m
3
, which exceeds the maximum 
concentrations recorded for this region.  Evolution 
of the bloom into a filament indicates that stirring 
not only controlled the dispersion but also the 
development of phytoplankton blooms.  Analysis 
indicates that the patch was spreading at a low 
enough rate for phytoplankton growth to 
accumulate biomass and for the iron to remain 
above a critical level, but high enough to maintain 
silicate entrainment for diatom growth. 
Furthermore, the persistence of the bloom indicates 
that the majority of the iron that remained in the 
surface waters on Day 13 was still available  
6 weeks later (Abraham et al., 2000). 
 
Conclusions 
 
SOIREE has successfully demonstrated that the 
significance of iron in water was broadly 
representative of 75% of polar waters during the 
austral summer in this region of the Southern 
Ocean.  The results indicate that iron controls the 
magnitude of production and community 
composition, and further support the link between 
iron, phytoplankton and climate, although the 
ultimate fate of the iron-mediated bloom is 
speculative.  The observations have raised 
fundamental questions relating to iron 
biogeochemistry and retention in the surface ocean, 
and identified the importance of stirring to the 
maintenance of phytoplankton blooms.

Introduction 
 
This paper describes the preliminary results on the 
spatial description of iron in the Northeast Pacific 
Ocean, being conducted on board the CCGS John P . 
Tully for a joint project between the Climate 
Chemistry Laboratory of the Institute of Ocean 
Sciences (IOS, Canada) and the Biology 
Department of the Central Research Institute of the 
Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI, Japan).   
 
The upper waters of the subarctic Pacific Ocean, 
equatorial Pacific and Southern Ocean are the three 
major HNLC (high nutrients, low chlorophyll) 
regimes in the world oceans.  They are 
characterized by a shortage of iron as a 
micronutrient, thus inhibiting the growth of 
diatoms and limiting the full utilization of the 
macronutrients available in the surface mixed layer.   
The seasonal and spatial distributions of iron are 
therefore, fundamental to understanding the 
availability and utilization of this essential 
micronutrient by diatoms in HNLC waters. 
 
Iron in seawater is difficult to measure due to the 
ubiquitous presence of iron as a contaminant in the 
sampling and measuring procedures, with dust in 
the air and rust from ship and oceanographic 
sampling gears and wires.  Extreme care is required 
in all phases of shipboard sampling and analysis to 
ensure data integrity.  This paper describes the 
salient points in the detection of iron in seawater, 
results of recent measurements from IOS cruises on 
Line P and Station P, and a project to study 
mesoscale eddies in the Northeast Pacific Ocean.  
Nishioka et al. (2001) describes the distribution of 
soluble and small colloidal iron for these cruises. 
 
The definitions used to distinguish different forms 
of dissolved iron are: (1) labile, unfiltered seawater, 
 
(2) dissolved, <0.45µm, (3) labile particulate, (1) 
minus (2), (4) colloidal, between 0.1 and 0.45 µm, 
and (5) soluble plus small colloidal, <0.1 µm.  In 
this study, the main form discussed here is labile 
(sometimes called total dissolvable) iron. 
 
Methods 
 
Samples for iron analyses were collected under two 
separate projects:  (1) a Station P/Line P monitoring 
study and (2) an eddy study in the Northeast Pacific 
Ocean.  For project (1), iron distribution on Line P 
from the west coast of Vancouver Island to Station 
P (i.e., P26) is shown in Figure 1, with sampling 
stations at regular oceanographic stations of P04 
(48º 29′N, 126º 40'W), P12 (48º 58′N, 130º 40′W), 
P16 (49º 17′N, 134º 40′W), P20 (49º 34′N, 138º 
40′W) and P26 (50º 00′N, 145º 00′W).  At these 
stations, hydro-casts for iron samples were made 
for depths of 10, 25, 75, 100, 200, 300, 400 and  
600 m as well as 800 and 1000 m in more recent 
expeditions.   Surface sampling was done from a 
Zodiac rubber boat.  For the Eddy Project (project 
2), iron sampling was made during special cruises 
to monitor the water properties at the edge and 
inside the eddy as it moved from the coastal ocean 
towards the vicinity of Station P.  Similar profiles 
for iron were made, as described for the regular 
Station P/Line P monitoring project.  
 
Sampling of seawater for the iron study was done in 
several ways.  At hydro-stations, 30 Go-flow™ 
samplers were pre-cleaned in the laboratory by 
sequential soaking with 5% Extran for about 1 day, 
then 0.1% HCl or dilute 0.1M ascobic acid, or a 
mixture of both, for a few days with DMQ rinses in 
between.  At sea the samplers were filled with 
seawater at low iron levels for about 1 day for 
soaking.

Samples from 75 m and below were collected using 
30 L (or 10 L for Station P04 only) bottles on a 
1,000-m Kevlar line spliced to the hydrowire on a 
hydro winch, with a layer of plastic separating the 
Kevlar from the steel line.  Lead weights, freshly 
encased in epoxy resin, were attached to the end of 
the Kevlar line.  Shallow samples at 10, 25 and  
40 m were also collected using an air-driven Teflon 
pump and Teflon sampling tube with handling done 
in a PVC HEPA clean hood on deck.  Seawater 
samples were drawn from Go-flow™ samplers on 
deck using boxes with extended sides and roof to 
minimize air disturbance.  A Teflon tube was 
attached to a Teflon valve on the Go-flow™ and on 
the other end, a bell jar covered the sample bottles 
during sub-sampling.  Two to six 250-ml 
pre-cleaned CPE bottles, after rinsing three times, 
were immediately filled with seawater.  Normally, 
two were unfiltered, and one each was filtered 
through a 90 mm 0.45 µm Durapore membrane 
filter, and a 0.1µm (0.22 µm used since June, 2000) 
Opticap cartridge by Millipore.   
 
Analysis 
 
Iron analyses were made inside a shipboard clean 
laboratory of about 10′ × 7 ′, constructed with 
polyethylene sheets with a small entry cubicle.  A 
positive-pressure clean hood (Class 100 EACI 
laminar flow work station at ~360 cubic feet per 
minute) with a Class 100 HEPA filter created a 
clean space for reagent preparation and sample 
processing.  A tacky mat at the entrance eliminated 
dirt on shoes and personnel entering the clean room 
wore clean plastic suits with hoods, boots and 
gloves.  A milli-Q ultra-violet system inside the 
clean room supplied high purity water (DMQ) for 
reagents, standards and cleaning.  
 
A chemiluminescence technique (Obata et al., 
1993) with modifications (Obata et al., 1997) was 
used.  A semi-automated system, constructed by the 
Climate Chemistry Laboratory, was used.  The 
method is a combination of selective column 
extraction using chelating resin and 
chemiluminescence detection.  Samples were 
buffered to pH 3.2 using a buffer solution of formic 
acid-ammonium formate.  Samples were delivered 
to the system using an eight port valve (Hamilton 
MVP 8) and a peristaltic pump.  About 4–16 ml 
were passed through a resin column of 8-hydroxyl 
quinnolin immobilized on silica gel at a flow rate of 
4 ml per minute.  The iron was then removed from 
the column using dilute HCl (0.3N).  The resulting 
eluent was then mixed with luminol, aqueous 
ammonia and hydrogen peroxide, prior to entering 
the cell (Teflon tubing coiled on a mirror).  A 
Hamamatsu photo multiplier tube measured the 
light emitted from the chemiluminescent reaction 
of the iron and luminol as the eluent passed through 
the cell with the resulting signal recorded on a 
laptop computer.

Reagents  
 
The reagents were prepared as described in Obata et 
al. (1997): Seastar ultrapure grade HCl and NH

re-crystallized luminol and TETA (triethylene 
tetramine), K

(Baker Ultrapure grade) and twice quartz distilled 
HCOOH.  The 8-quinolinol immobilized chlelating 
resin was obtained from Dr. H. Obata.  Reagents 
were prepared in advance to allow for degassing of 
the aerated DMQ between the feed source on the 
ship and the shipboard laboratory. 
 
Standards  
 
AAS Standard Fe(III) of 1,000 ppm solution 
commercially available was used to prepare a 
primary standard (1,000 ppb) and secondary 
standard (10 ppb), which were used to prepare fresh 
daily working standards.  Seawater, collected from 
Station P surface waters and filtered through a 0.1 
μm cartridge filter, was used to make up standards.  
The iron content was < 0.l nM. 
 
Results and discussion 
 
The study area covered Line P (48.5ºN, 126ºW to 
50ºN, 145ºW) and Line Z (47°N, 145°W to 59.5°N, 
145°W).  At Station P, inter-calibrations (Fig. 2) 
were made between IOS and CRIEPI using 
basically the same technique and sampling 
equipment.  John Martin’s profile (Martin and 
Fitzwater, 1988) in 1987, using the atomic 
absorption technique, is also plotted in the figure 
for comparison.  There was good agreement 
between IOS and CRIEPI for seawater at a depth 
lower than about 400 m, while in the upper ocean 
the CRIEPI values were slightly higher. 
 
The vertical profiles  (0–1,000 m) of unfiltered 
labile (LFe) iron for June 1998 (cruise #9815) on 
Line P (Fig. 3), showed relatively low (<0.1 to 0.4 
nM) iron in the surface 50 m.  At coastal station P04, 
iron increased rapidly to a high value of 4.5 nM at 
600 m, then decreased slowly to 3.6 nM at 1,000 m.  
Station P12 showed a slightly higher value in the 
upper 100 m and below 500 m compared to the 
other offshore stations.  For the offshore stations 
P16, P20 and P26 (Station P) in the HNLC waters, 
iron values were generally < 0.1 nM in the upper 
100 m with a small increase to about 0.5 to 0.6 nM 
at depths from 400 to 1,000 m.

Horizontal surface iron distribution (labile and 
dissolved, 0.1 µm filtered) at depths of 10 and 20 m 
in September 1997 is shown in Figure. 4.  There is a 
high coastal labile iron concentration at 0.75 nM 
and much lower distribution of <0.15 nM farther 
offshore from P19 to P26.  At Station P17 (at 
136°W), there is marked increase to 0.35 nM and 
for stations at 143°W and 145°W, a smaller increase 
to 0.2 nM, indicating possible transport of iron-rich 
waters either vertically or by eddies. 
  
The Haida Eddy is a slow-moving eddy formed 
near the Queen Charlotte Islands, off the west coast 
of British Columbia.  The eddy is anti-cyclonic, has 
a diameter of about 200–300 km, and moves at 
about 3–5 km per day to the west towards Station P.  
The Haida Eddy 1998, formed just outside Queen 
Charlotte Islands in February 1998, moved in a path 
opposite to the direction of the Alaskan arm of the 
eastern sub-arctic gyre, first southward along 
134ºW to 48ºN 136ºW (February 1998), then 
southwestward towards 46ºN 141ºW (February, 
2000).  Iron measurements from the surface to a 
depth of 600 m were made at the centre, the edge 
and outside the eddy (Fig. 5) in Haida 2000.  In the 
centre, labile iron in the surface mixed layer down 
to 50 m was about the same as at the edge of the 
eddy.  To the south of the eddy, the labile iron was 
higher in the surface due to coastal seawater 
streaming from Hecate Strait. 
 
Open ocean values are shown from P20 to 
demonstrate how much more iron is found in 
coastal and eddy seawater.  Below the pycnocline at 
about 100–120 m, labile iron from the centre of the 
eddy was much higher than the values at the edge 
and outside the eddy.  This indicated that the centre 
of the anti-cyclonic Haida Eddy conserved high 
iron after it left the coastal zone.  The original depth 
of the Haida Eddy was thought to be 200 to 300 m, 
indicating that some iron was being transported to 
depth as the eddy aged.   The iron content after 
filtration through a 0.22 µm Millipore/Durapore 
filter, was only 25% lower.  The same is true for the 
stations at the centre and on the edge of the eddy.  
By September, the surface iron was probably 
approaching limits for the Haida Eddy when both 
labile and dissolved iron (<0.22 µm) in the whole 
upper 75 m were both below 0.05 nM while water 
below this was still more than double what was 
found at P20.

Conclusions 
 
1. Shipboard iron measurements by chemi- 
luminesence technique using clean reagents, 
sampling procedures and analytical 
environment are compatible between CRIEPI 
and IOS laboratories. 
 
2. The vertical distribution of iron in HNLC 
waters in the Northeast Pacific showed very 
low surface values while in deep waters, iron 
was high but was prevented from reaching the 
surface mixed layer because of a strong 
pynocline at 100 m depth. 
3. The horizontal distribution of iron in 
September, 1997, from coastal to open-ocean 
waters showed a progressive decrease, with 
high values of 0.8 nM just west of Vancouver 
Island to <0.1 nM at Station P (P26) with high 
values at Station P17 in between, suggesting 
the possibility of eddy transport of high iron 
from coastal waters to offshore. 
 
4. In an eddy study in the Northeast Pacific to 
track the change in water properties, iron 
distribution was measured at the edge, outside 
and at the centre of the Haida Eddy.  Coastal 
iron outside and at the edge of the eddy showed 
similar features with depth, but in the centre of 
the eddy below the pycnocline, iron was almost 
doubled, suggesting that iron was trapped 
inside the eddy.  Compared with open ocean 
seawater, the eddy contained more than four 
times as much iron below 75 m.

The distributions of iron and manganese in the 
surface layers were investigated in the North 
Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea.  Samples were 
collected during the research cruise of R/V 
Hakuho-maru (University of Tokyo), KH-99-3 
(from June 25 to July 22, 1999).  Iron and 
manganese concentrations were determined with 
automated chemiluminescence methods 
(Nakayama et al., 1989; Obata et al., 1993, 1997).  
Iron was depleted at 0–50 m all through the 
sampling stations, but iron concentrations below 50 
m showed contrasting distributions between the 
western and the eastern sides of the North Pacific 
Ocean, and the Bering Sea.  To discuss the 
difference in the iron sources between the stations, 
iron distributions were compared with those of 
manganese.  As the residence time of manganese in 
the surface layer is relatively long (5–19 yr, 
Landing and Bruland, 1987), manganese is suitable 
as a tracer for the supply of a lithogenic substance.  
The relationship between nitrate and silicate in the 
surface layers also showed various patterns in each 
oceanic regime.  Iron limitation is reported to affect 
the uptake ratio of silicate to nitrate by diatoms 
(Takeda, 1998), and the supply of iron may 
influence the relationship between nitrate and 
silicate in the surface layer.

Assessment of the lower limit of iron addition required to initiate massive diatom 
blooms in the eastern equatorial Pacific

Introduction 
 
The issue of iron limitation in the oceans has 
garnered rapidly increasing interest since the 
successful mesoscale iron enrichment experiment 
in the equatorial Pacific known as IronEx II.  This 
experiment demonstrated unequivocally that iron is 
limiting diatom (and thus export) production in the 
eastern equatorial Pacific high nitrate, low 
chlorophyll (HNLC) regime (Coale et al., 1996). 
Iron infusion transformed the oceanic 
picoplanktonic phytoplankton assemblage into a 
coastal-type pennate diatom-dominated 
assemblage, increasing total chlorophyll levels 20 
times over levels outside the enriched patch.  The 
accompanying macronutrient and TCO
2
 depletion 
during the first 12 days of the bloom testify to the 
major geochemical impact that iron flux alone can 
have in this region (Steinberg et al., 1998). 
 
Although the IronEx II enrichment study clearly 
demonstrated iron limitation of phytoplankton 
production, the experiment was not designed to 
ascertain the minimum iron flux needed to generate 
large diatom blooms in equatorial Pacific waters.  
Iron concentrations generated within the infused 
patch (2 nM) were low by coastal standards but 
were massive in comparison to ambient levels, 
raising iron concentrations by two orders of 
magnitude.  Assessing the lower limit of required 
iron enrichment is important because it provides 
insight to the scale of natural perturbations that 
could cause these types of bloom events. For 
example, if high iron flux is required, then 
significant iron-induced increases in export 
production could only be a response to climate 
change.  However, if comparatively minor 
increases in iron flux are necessary, then increased 
export production might precede and contribute to 
global climate change. 
 
Although there remains uncertainty about which 
iron species are available to phytoplankton in 
general, and diatoms in particular, iron uptake 
appears to be restricted to the truly soluble, or low 
molecular weight fraction in seawater (Wells et al., 
1995).  Here, I present results from cross-flow 
filtration (CFF) studies during IronEx II where iron 
was partitioned into dissolved (< 0.4 μm), soluble 
(< 1 kDa) and colloidal (1 kDa to 0.4 µm) size 
fractions.  The results demonstrate that the soluble 
iron fraction increased only minimally despite 
nanomolar iron additions, the bulk of added iron 
occurring in the colloidal size phase.  Soluble iron 
concentrations changed in conjunction with 
chlorophyll increase and macronutrient drawdown.  
The relative drawdown of silicic acid and nitrate 
suggest the diatom population continued to 
experience iron stress throughout bloom 
development, despite calculations indicating the 
pennate diatoms were not diffusion limited at the 
concentrations of soluble iron measured.  These 
findings help to constrain the magnitude of iron 
flux needed to initiate and sustain large 
phytoplankton blooms in equatorial HNLC waters. 
 
Materials and methods 
 
Samples were collected from various locations near 
the center of the enriched patch (marked by a 
drogue buoy) using Teflon
®
-lined 30 L GO-Flo 
bottles (General Oceanics) on a Kevlar line 
(Philadelphia Resins).  M. Gordon (Moss Landing 
Marine Laboratory) kindly provided 20 L carboys 
of conventionally filtered (< 0.4 µm) samples for 
processing.  These 20 L dissolved samples were 
then further size fractionated by CFF using a 1-kDa 
membrane (Filtron).  Details of the steps used are 
given in Wells (2003).  CFF processing was 
completed within ~ 5 h of sample collection.  
Samples were acidified with 4 ml of quartz-distilled 
6 N HCl per liter and stored for several months 
before extraction and analysis. 
 
The dissolved (< 0.4 µm), permeate (< 1 kDa) and 
retentate (1 kDa to 0.4 µm) samples were extracted 
before analysis using a new solid phase extraction 
procedure (Wells and Bruland, 1998). Sample 
106 
extracts were analyzed on a Finnigan MAT 
ELEMENT magnetic sector (high resolution) 
ICP-MS. Colloid concentrations were calculated 
using the concentration factor (cf) of the individual 
CFF run and the measured metal concentrations in 
the retentate and permeate fractions: 
colloid [] =
retentate [] − permeate []
cf
 
This quantification of colloid concentrations is 
more robust than simply subtracting permeate  
(< 1 kDa) from total dissolved (< 0.2 µm) 
concentrations because: (1) the latter depends on 
accurately measuring the difference between two 
large numbers, and (2) the mass balance can be 
determined for each CFF run:  
< 0.2μm [] = permeate [] + colloid [] 
Good agreement between the sum of permeate and 
calculated colloid concentrations with dissolved 
values is strong evidence that CFF processing was 
not significantly influenced by contamination or 
sorptive losses of soluble or colloidal species to the 
membrane. 
 
Results 
 
Results from pre-release sampling indicate that 
~85% of the ambient dissolved iron was soluble in 
nature, with ~3 pM Fe occurring in the colloidal 
phase.  Reliable identification of such a small 
colloidal component within the dissolved phase 
would be impossible from the simple difference 
between dissolved (< 0.4 µm) and permeate  
(< 1 kDa) values.  However, the comparatively high 
retentate concentration (152 ± 22 pM Fe), along 
with the good mass balance (104%), raises 
confidence that the extent of the soluble/colloidal 
partitioning is reasonably accurate.  
 
Dissolved iron concentrations within the enriched 
patch cycled repeatedly from nanomolar to 
picomolar levels, with dissolved iron 
concentrations decreasing sharply after each 
infusion.  The rate of this iron disappearance 
increased progressively from the first to third 
infusions.  The vast majority of the added iron 
occurred in the colloidal phase, with soluble  
(< 1 kDa) concentrations increasing by only  
~ 25 pM over ambient levels.  The percentage of 
colloidal iron decreased from nearly 100% 
immediately following the first infusion to ~60%  
9 days later.  Colloidal-sized iron phases continued 
to dominate iron speciation even when total 
dissolved iron concentrations within the patch fell 
to near pre-release levels. 
 
Soluble iron concentrations increased from 16 to  
~ 40 pM Fe over the four days following the first 
infusion.  This trend preceded increases in Chl-a 
concentrations by 2 full days.  After biomass (as 
indicated by Chl-a) began to increase dramatically 
on Day 5–6, soluble iron concentrations dropped 
precipitously and then remained at near pre-release 
levels through Day 9, the final day of CFF 
sampling. 
 
The relative drawdown rate of nitrate and silicic 
acid provides some insight to the level of iron stress 
experienced by diatoms within the patch.  The 
silicic acid:nitrate ratio in surface waters was 0.5 
before infusion began.  Alleviation of iron 
limitation by infusion led to an initially balanced 
drawdown of nitrate and silicic acid.  But 
approximately 1.5 days after the second infusion 
the Si:N drawdown ratio increased significantly, 
with the subsequent linear decrease in dissolved 
Si:N ratios being synchronous with decreased 
soluble iron concentrations and increases in Chl-a. 
A minimum dissolved silicic acid:nitrate ratio of 
0.14 occurred on Day 13 after Chl-a concentrations 
peaked before beginning to increase again in 
conjunction with decreasing Chl-a concentrations. 
 
Discussion 
 
Some insight to the minimum level of iron needed 
to generate massive diatom blooms comes from 
size-fractionated analysis of iron within the infused 
patch during IronEx II.  Although there remains 
uncertainty about which iron species are available 
to phytoplankton in general, and diatoms in 
particular, iron uptake appears to be restricted to the 
truly soluble, or low molecular weight fraction in 
seawater (Wells et al., 1995).  The colloidal 
proportion of added iron was initially extremely 
high (99%) but decreased somewhat with each 
infusion (90% in the second infusion; 60% in the 
third infusion).  However, this progressive change 
is largely due to the decreasing concentrations of 
total dissolved iron measured in the samples 
obtained after each infusion.  This trend may be 
simply due to the non-homogeneous distribution of 
 
107 
iron within the patch, but it also is likely that the 
increasing iron demand by the rapidly growing 
population resulted in higher short-term rates of 
iron removal from the dissolved phase. 
 
Soluble iron concentrations (or that containing the 
iron species known to be directly accessed by 
phytoplankton) doubled after the initial iron 
infusion and continued to increase over the first 4 
days, reaching a maximum of ~ 40 pM Fe.  During 
the same time, total Fe(III) complexing organic 
ligands increased by 400% to ~ 2 nM, with most of 
the increase attributed to the stronger ligand class 
(Rue and Bruland, 1997).  The bulk of these 
iron–ligand complexes were colloidal in size, in 
contrast to pre-release conditions where the strong 
ligand–iron complexes were largely in the soluble 
phase.  The increase in soluble iron concentrations 
during the first 4 days presumably reflects a small 
change in the size distribution of these ligands with 
time, through either the biotic release of low 
molecular weight iron complexing ligands or by the 
escape of low molecular weight ligands from 
colloidal polymer matrices (Chin et al., 1998). 
 
A dramatic decrease in soluble iron concentrations 
was observed on Day 6, likely due to the rapidly 
increasing iron demand, as evidenced by the 
increasing Chl-a concentrations across this interval.  
The total iron demand can be estimated from Chl-a 
concentrations and cellular iron quotas measured 
for oceanic diatoms under controlled conditions.  
Chl-a increased within the patch by ~ 3 µg L
–1
 over 
the first 9 days, corresponding to an increase in 
cellular carbon of ~1.7  × 10
–5
 moles C L
–1
 (0.20 
mmol Chl:mol C (Sunda and Huntsman, 1995)).  
Taking a lower value for the cellular Fe:C ratio for 
oceanic diatoms (5 µmol Fe:mol C, Sunda and 
Huntsman, 1995) yields a minimum cellular iron 
demand of ~90 pM Fe to fuel the increase in Chl-a 
measured.  This value underestimates actual 
demand because neither grazing nor “luxury” 
uptake of iron by cells is taken into account.  It is 
clear then that significant iron flux from the 
colloidal through the soluble phase was required to 
support bloom development. 
 
Assessing what iron flux to surface waters is 
required to stimulate large diatom blooms like that 
generated by IronEx II reduces to two issues:  
(1) what is the lowest iron concentration whereby 
uptake still permits maximum cellular growth rates, 
and (2) what iron flux to surface waters is then 
needed to sustain high diatom productivity once 
this concentration threshold is surpassed?  The 
distinction between concentration and flux is 
important because it constrains the magnitude of 
events needed to generate intense diatom blooms.  
The minimum iron concentration at which pennate 
diatom growth becomes diffusion limited was 
estimated as a function of cell length and cell shape.  
The parameters chosen for this calculation were a 
molecular diffusivity of 0.9 × 10
–5
 cm
2
 s
–1
 (for iron 
species sized near inorganic complexes), a cellular 
iron content of 50 µmoles L
–1
 of cytoplasm (Sunda 
and Huntsman, 1995), a cellular aspect ratio of 20 
(length/width) and a growth rate of 1 d
–1
 (K. Bares, 
pers. comm.).  The result illustrates the extreme 
benefit pennate diatoms enjoy over their centric 
cousins with respect to diffusional constraints.  To 
escape diffusion-limited growth conditions, centric 
diatoms 15 µm in diameter require > 160 times 
higher iron concentrations than pennate diatoms  
15 µm in length.  This difference might help 
explain why centric diatoms flourished in some 
bottle enrichment studies with equatorial Pacific 
waters (Maldonado and Price, 1996) while pennate 
species dominated in the mesoscale experiment; 
iron availability in the bottles would have remained 
comparatively high because iron was not lost from 
the system. 
 
The question of the iron flux needed to sustain high 
diatom productivity (once diffusion limitation 
concentrations are surpassed) is more complex.  
While the iron flux used during IronEx II was 
massive (compared to ambient inputs), and the 
resultant diatom response dramatic, there is reason 
to suspect that growth rates in the patch remained 
below maximum levels.  Growth rates of oceanic 
diatoms in controlled culture conditions reach  
≥ 1.5 d
–1
 (Sunda and Huntsman, 1995; Maldonado 
and Price, 1996), significantly higher than the 
growth rate estimated during the bloom (1 d
–1
, K. 
Bares, pers. comm.).  Indeed, there is evidence that 
diatoms were experiencing iron stress in the midst 
of bloom development.  It has been shown recently 
that diatoms draw down nitrate and silicic acid 
equally under iron-replete conditions, but iron 
stress causes a shift to the preferential removal of 
silicic acid (Hutchins and Bruland, 1998).  By this 
measure, the low ambient nitrate:silicic acid ratio 
(~0.5) indicates the influence of iron limitation 
prior to the first iron infusion.  The subsequent 
utilization of these nutrients begins equally shortly 
after infusion but the drawdown ratio then drops 
108 
sharply as Chl-a increases, and soluble iron 
concentrations decrease.  These findings strongly 
indicate that the bloom organisms had become iron 
stressed despite the third iron infusion on Day 7. 
These data add further support to the finding that 
diatoms were unable to access all of the iron in the 
soluble phase.  As a result, the geochemical impact 
of the bloom on nitrate drawdown and the carbon 
cycle was smaller that it would have been if silicic 
acid utilization had been more efficient. 
 
Despite our uncertainty about the iron forms that 
phytoplankton access in seawater, the results here 
demonstrate that concentrations of soluble iron 
complexed by natural organic ligands need only 
increase slightly ( ≤ 25 pM) above ambient levels 
for large diatoms to grow rapidly.  However, what is 
not clear is whether the increase in strong Fe(III) 
complexing organic ligand concentrations that 
accompany large influxes of iron ultimately result 
in lower effective supply of iron to diatoms and 
other large eukaryotic organisms.  If so, then slow, 
persistent influxes of iron may not be able to 
maintain high diatom growth once the chemical 
speciation of iron again becomes dominated by 
complexation with strong organic chelators.

Recently, a number of studies pointed out that the 
Fe(III) complexation with natural organic ligands is 
possible in oceanic waters, but the detailed vertical 
distribution, origin and chemical identity of organic 
ligands are largely unknown.  Here, we report the 
spatial vertical distributions of Fe(III) hydroxide 
solubility in subarctic and subtropical water masses 
and the boundary zone in the northwestern North 
Pacific Ocean.  The detailed vertical profiles of 
Fe(III) hydroxide solubility have the following 
features in common:   
• the solubility in the surface mixed layer 
(0–50–100 m) is generally high and variable 
(0.3–1.9 nM);  
• the solubility minima (0.2–0.4 nM) occur at 
depths of 75–125 m, below the suface mixed 
layer;  
• the subsequent solubility levels in middepth 
waters appear to increase with depth in 
association with the increase in nutrient 
concentrations in the subtropical and boundary 
 
zone (0.2–0.7 nM) or to vary little with high 
constant solubility (0.7 nM) and nutrient values 
in the subarctic zone (upwelling area);  
• the solubility levels in deep waters (>1000–1500 
m) tend to decrease a little to 0.4–0.5 nM with 
depth in association with the decrease in nutrient 
concentrations.   
 
The higher Fe(III) hydroxide solubility in the 
surface mixed layer is probably due to higher 
concentration or stronger affinity of natural organic 
Fe(III) chelators, which were possibly released by 
phytoplankton or bacteria during their metabolism.  
There are significant correlations between the 
Fe(III) hydroxide solubility and the nutrient (PO
4
, 
NO
3
+NO

) concentration in deeper waters below 
the depth of minimum solubility, suggesting the 
regenerative formation of organic Fe(III) chelators 
through oxidative decomposition and 
transformation of biogenic organic matter sinking 
into the deep waters.

Ocean Station Papa (OSP) in the subarctic NE 
Pacific at 50°N and 145°W, has been the site of 
open ocean research for the last 40 years, 
commencing with sampling conducted on board the 
Canadian weatherships from 1956–1981.  
Hydrocasts were carried out to a depth of 1200 m at 
OSP.  In 1959, 5 stations were sampled along the 
line connecting OSP to the coast (Line P) and by 
1964, 13 stations along Line P were established.  
During the 25-year weathership era, temperature, 
salinity, nutrients (nitrate, phosphate and  
silicate), Chl-a and zooplankton were sampled 
approximately weekly (but with considerable 
variability).  This good temporal coverage firmly 
established the annual cycle at OSP.  This cycle is 
provided in some detail by Whitney and Freeland 
(1999), and only the highlights are summarized 
here.  The range in selected parameters is given in  
Table 1.  In the winter, winds average  
12 m s
–1
 and the surface waters are mixed to about 
120 m (much shallower than the Atlantic Ocean 
where mixing occurs to about 300 m).  Surface 
temperature reaches a minimum of 5–6°C, salinity 
increases to 32.7 and maximum winter nitrate and 
silicate are 15.8 ± 2.3 and 24.0 ± 3.4 µM, 
respectively.  Winter Chl-a is approximately 
0.2–0.3 µg L
–1
.  The mean irradiance levels 
received by cells traversing the mixed layer is 0.91 
and 2.3 mol quanta m
–2
 d
–1
 in February and October, 
respectively (Maldonado et al., 1999).  As incident 
irradiance increases and the mixed layer depth 
(MLD) decreases in spring, Chl-a increases from 
0.2–0.4 µg L
–1
 (there is no spring bloom as 
observed in the Atlantic Ocean).  It is interesting 
that nitrate drawdown begins in April, while 
silicate begins to decline in early June.  Sediment 
traps at 200 m depth show the highest downward 
flux of Si from June to July, whereas N fluxes are 
high from May through September (Wong et al., 
1999).  In August/September, when the MLD is 
only 40 m and surface temperatures reach 12–13°C, 
nitrate and silicate reach minimal values of about 
8–9 and 13 µM, respectively.  This represents a 
drawdown in nitrate and silicate of 7 and 11 µM, 
respectively, and a Si:N drawdown ratio of 1.6:1.  
This ratio suggests iron limitation since it is higher 
than the normal 1:1 Si:N ratio (Hutchins et al., 
1998). 
 
At the end of the weathership era, three key 
observations were used to explain how the 
ecosystem functioned.  Since there was no spring 
bloom and minimum summer nitrate values were 
8–9 µM (not 0), it was suggested that the large 
copepods which migrated to the surface and grew 
quickly in size, controlled the phytoplankton 
standing crop via grazing (i.e., top down control) 
and aided secondarily by low light (Parsons and 
Lalli, 1988).  This conclusion was logical because it 
was before the realization of the importance of 
small phytoplankton (picoplankton) and 
microzooplankton, and the discovery of iron 
limitation. 
 
In the mid-1980s, the Subarctic Pacific Ecosystem 
Research (SUPER) group challenged the “major 
grazer hypothesis” (Frost, 1987).  They found that 
the main diet of these large copepods (Neocalanus 
spp. and others) was not phytoplankton.  They were 
mainly carnivores and they consumed only small 
amounts of phytoplankton (Dagg, 1993).  In 
addition, Booth et al. (1993) found that 
phytoplankton < 5 µm dominated the phyto- 
plankton standing stock.  Just as the field work by 
SUPER was ending, Martin and his colleagues 
made the startling discovery that iron limited 
primary productivity at OSP (Martin and Fitzwater, 
1988).  Therefore, within a few years these three 
new key observations dramatically revised our 
ideas of how this ecosystem functioned.

By the beginning of the Canadian JGOFS (Joint 
Global Ocean Flux Study) project in 1992, the issue 
of iron limitation was not resolved, specifically the 
iron limitation versus grazing debate, because the 
large grazers were usually excluded from the 
previous bottle experiments (Banse, 1990; Miller et 
al., 1991; Frost, 1991; Miller, 1993).  During the 
early 1990s, further shipboard iron enrichment 
experiments by Boyd and colleagues confirmed 
that iron limitation did limit phytoplankton stocks 
despite the presence of mesozooplankton levels 
comparable to the highest in situ upper ocean levels 
observed at OSP (Boyd et al., 1999).  Furthermore, 
the iron enrichment in carboy experiments 
facilitated the drawdown of nitrate in May and 
September (Boyd et al., 1996).  When iron was 
added in their experiments, large predominately 
pennate diatoms (> 18 µm) grew, confirming 
Martin and Fitzwater’s (1988) earlier observations.  
This result was surprising since oceanic pennate 
diatoms were usually considered to be a minor 
component of oceanic phytoplankton assemblages.  
Iron limitation was also confirmed by biophysical 
(F
v
/F
m
 fluorescence ratio, Boyd et al., 1998a) and 
biochemical (an iron-mediated reduction in the 
expression of the molecular marker for iron 
limitation, flavodoxin; LaRoche et al., 1996) 
markers.  In February, when Boyd added iron, little 
or no increase in Chl-a was observed after a 5-day 
incubation, and it was suggested that light may be a 
co-limiting factor along with iron (Boyd et al., 
1996).  This suggestion was later confirmed by 
Maldonado et al. (1999) who demonstrated 
co-limitation of phytoplankton growth by iron and 
light during winter at OSP. 
 
Ammonium showed little seasonality with 
concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 µM 
 
113 
(Table 1).  Urea concentrations were generally from 
0.1 to 0.5 µg-at L
–1
, except for May 1993 when 
surface urea was 0.8 and up to 2.0 µg-at L
–1 
at  
40 m (V arela and Harrison, 1999).  Nitrate, urea and 
ammonium uptake rates in winter (February/ 
March) were 1.8, 1.0, and 3.2 mg-at N m
–2
  d
–1
 , 
respectively; in spring (May) they were 2.7, 3.3 and 
5.4 and in late summer (September) they were 3.9, 
3.6 and 5.8 mg at N m
–2
  d
–1
, respectively.  The 
seasonally averaged depth- integrated absolute 
uptake rates were 27% nitrate, 23% urea and 50% 
ammonium.  There was no significant difference in 
the annual trend for the depth-integrated f-ratio, and 
the seasonal average was 0.25.  Phytoplankton 
utilized nitrogen in the following order; NH
4
 >> 
NO
3
 > urea.  The  f-ratio was overestimated by up to 
36% when urea was excluded from the calculation 
(Varela and Harrison, 1999). 
 
There is low seasonality in primary productivity 
with mean winter and spring/summer values of 300 
and 800 mg C m
–2
 d
–1
, respectively (Boyd and 
Harrison, 1999).  Using Wong et al.’s (1995) fall 
values of 366 mg C m
–2
 d
–1
, and the values by Boyd 
and Harrison (1999) above, yields an annual 
estimate of 215 g C m
–2
 y
–1
 which is somewhat 
higher than Wong et al.’s (1995) estimate of 140 g 
C m
–2
  y
–1
  and Welschmeyer et al.’s (1993) 
estimate of 170 g C m
–2
  y
–1
  (using Wong’s winter 
values) (Harrison et al., 1999).  This annual 
primary productivity is quite high considering that 
OSP is similar to an oligotrophic gyre with nutrient 
(Fe) limitation, a phytoplankton assemblage 
dominated by small cells and the primary 
productivity based largely on regenerated nutrients 
(f-ratio = 0.25). 
 
The dominant small phytoplankton grow at 0.1 to 
0.8 d
–1
, similar to the growth rate of many 
microzooplankton (Landry et al., 1993; Boyd and 
Harrison, 1999).  Therefore, it has been suggested 
that these small phytoplankton are controlled by 
microzooplankton grazing (Landry et al., 1993), 
although results suggest that these micro- 
zooplankters preferentially ingest heterotrophic 
rather than autotrophic picoplankton (Rivkin et al., 
1999).  The large copepods such as Neocalanus sp. 
are now known to be omnivores rather than 
herbivores (Dagg, 1993).  In fact, when twice the 
maximum ambient number of Neocalanus 
plumchrus was added to a carboy enriched with 
iron, large pennate diatoms grew and they were not 
grazed down by high abundances (comparable to 
the maximum ambient levels) of the large copepods 
(Boyd et al., 1999). 
 
In contrast to the conceptual phytoplankton– 
mesozooplankton food chain previously reported 
(Frost, 1987; Parsons and Lalli, 1988), now it is 
necessary to have two nitrogen sources and two 
size fractions of phytoplankton to explain the 
ecosystem dynamics at OSP.  The large 
phytoplankton are thought to exhibit bottom up 
control by iron (due to their higher iron cell quotas; 
Muggli et al., 1997), while the small phytoplankton 
exhibit top down control by microzooplankton 
grazing.  The large phytoplankton (mainly diatoms 
> 10 µm) increase in abunadance quickly when iron 
is added in carboy experiments and they are able to 
use up all the ambient nitrate.  They are not eaten to 
any marked extent by N. plumchrus, and thus these 
large cells likely sink out after they consume the 
iron addition (Muggli et al., 1996).  The small 
phytoplankton (mainly prasinophytes and 
prymnesiophytes < 5 µm) utilize regenerated 
nitrogen (NH
4
 and urea, Boyd et al., 1996; Varela 
and Harrison, 1999) to decrease the iron demand 
associated with nitrate reduction to ammonium. 
 
Microzooplankton span a wide size range and 
taxonomic group of organisms and, to date, they 
have not been well studied.  They consume mostly 
small phytoplankton and bacteria (Landry et al., 
1993; Rivkin et al., 1999).  Their biomass shows 
little seasonality, unlike the 5- to 10-fold increase in 
mesozooplankton in May/June (mainly due to the 
increase in size of the C1 to C4 copepodites (Boyd 
et al., 1995, see their Table 1).  Therefore, the 
nearly 3-fold seasonal increase in primary 
productivity from winter to summer (Boyd and 
Harrison, 1999) is passed through the 
microzooplankton to provide part of the large 
increase in mesozooplankton biomass in May/June. 
 
Mean monthly downward particle fluxes at 3800 m 
show a distinct seasonality.  Flux rates of 38 mg m
–2 
d
–1
 (in February) have an annual minimum during 
winter months and a maximum of 150 mg m
–2 
d
–1
 
during summer.  The average downward mass flux 
at OSP is 52 g m
–2 
y
–1 
at 1000 m and 32 g m
–2 
y
–1 
at 
3800 m (Wong et al., 1999). 
 
Interannaul variability 
 
A warming of 1.2°C/century and freshening of 0.2 
psu/century in the surface waters at OSP has been 
114 
estimated by Freeland et al. (1997).  From these 
data, they calculated that the MLD has also 
decreased significantly (p = 0.05) from 130 m in the 
1960s to 100 m in the late 1990s.  This decrease in 
the MLD likely contributes to the decrease in the 
winter nutrient concentrations. 
 
In addition to these longer-term changes, El Niño 
events have resulted in rapid, short-lived changes.  
One of the strongest El Niño events of the century 
happened in 1982/83. During that time the largest 
particle flux to sediment traps at 3800 m occurred 
and 90% of this flux was opal; the particle flux was  
> 400 mg m
–2
  d
–1
  during late summer (Wong and 
Matear, 1999). 
 
During the transition from the La Niña in 1989 to 
the series of El Niños ending in 1994, the surface 
waters became warmer by 2°C, more saline by 0.3 
psu and the winter nitrate concentrations were 30% 
lower (Whitney et al., 1998).  In late summer, 
depletion of nitrate in the surface waters during the 
1989 La Niña period extended 250 km offshore, but 
during the 1994 El Niño period, surface nitrate 
depletion extended 600 km offshore.  This suggests 
that the boundary between the more coastal nitrate- 
limited area and the iron-limited offshore area can 
shift more offshore or onshore due to El Niño/La 
Niña events.  The lower winter nitrate supply 
during El Niño is estimated to have reduced new 
production by 40% and possibly shifted 
phytoplankton community structure to smaller 
primary producers (and a longer food chain) which 
could, in turn, have affected higher trophic levels 
(Whitney et al., 1998). 
 
Whitney and Freeland (1999) compared the nitrate 
and silicate concentrations of the 1970s to the 
1990s and observed that the winter nitrate has 
decreased by 2.5 µM and silicate by 3.6 µM.  Their 
nutrient utilization between February and 
September has declined from 7.8 to 6.5 µM NO
3
 
and from 8.5 to 6.0 µM Si (the Si:NO
3
 ratio 
decreased from 1.08 to 0.92).  The larger decrease 
in silicate uptake (29%) relative to the decrease in 
nitrate uptake (17%) suggests that the supply of 
iron may also have declined during these two 
decades because the Si:N uptake ratio for 
phytoplankton increases under iron limitation 
(Hutchins et al., 1998). 
 
From 1956 to 1980 the mesozooplankton biomass 
has nearly doubled at OSP (Brodeur and Ware, 
1992).  An obvious question is: Has the 
phytoplankton biomass/productivity also 
increased?  There has been no apparent increase in 
Chl-a, despite the fact that GF/F filters (0.8 µm 
nominal pore size) were used in the 1990s 
compared to GF/C filters (1.8 µm nominal pore 
size) in the 1960s–70s.  However, early estimates of 
an annual primary productivity of 60 g C 
m
–2
 (McAllister et al., 1960) have increased to  
140 g C m
–2
 (Wong et al., 1995) and recently to 215 
g C m
–2
 (Harrison et al., 1999).  This 2- to 3-fold 
increase in primary productivity may be due to the 
use of trace metal clean techniques in the 1980s and 
90s, but the increase could be real and it could 
explain the doubling in the mesozooplankton 
biomass. 
 
The other long-term change in mesozooplankton is 
the arrival time of N. plumchrus into surface waters 
2 months earlier than in the 1960s–70s (Mackas et 
al., 1998).  The peak biomass (late C4 copepodites) 
now occurs in early May versus early July.  The 
reason for this earlier shift in this copepod’s life 
cycle in unclear, but it may be linked to the 
presently warmer surface waters. 
 
Interannual variation in nitrate and silicate was well 
documented in the 1970s due to the weekly 
sampling by weathership personnel.  During the 
summers of 1972, 1976 and 1979, silicate was 
depleted to < 1 µM, indicating that productivity 
was high and dominated by diatoms (Wong and 
Matear, 1999).  Both 1972 and 1976 were high 
silicate and nitrate utilization years, while 1976 had 
low nitrate utilization relative to silicate utilization 
(Si:NO
3
 drawdown = 3.6); the only way to explain 
this high ratio at present is to suggest severe iron 
limitation.  Unfortunately, during the decade of the 
1970s no sediment traps were deployed to assess 
changes in export to depth. 
 
During brief periods of 1964, 1965, 1969 and 1975, 
Chl-a concentrations were 10 times greater than 
ambient concentrations (i.e., > 3 µg L
–1
; Parslow 
1981).  One explanation for these Chl-a peaks is the 
episodic input of iron, based on the observations 
during iron addition experiments where pennate 
diatoms grow and draw down nitrate and silicate.  
Again, it would have been helpful to have had 
sediment traps to determine if this 10-fold increase 
in Chl-a resulted in increased particle fluxes (see 
Boyd et al. (1998b) for further discussion).  
Surprisingly, the detailed time series of nitrate and 
 
115 
silicate concentrations in 1975 do not show 
accompanying drawdowns in nitrate and silicate 
during the three peaks in chlorophyll.   
 
Summary 
 
The 40-year time series at OSP provides a valuable 
data set to resolve the ecosystem dynamics in this 
region.  The range of various ecosystem parameters 
at OSP is summarized in Table 1.  During 1956–81, 
the temporal resolution was excellent, however, the 
number of parameters that was measured was 
limited.  There was no size-fractionated Chl-a, no 
microzooplankton biomass estimates, and no 
sediment traps deployed.  The lack of these data 
limits the interpretation of unusual years.  For 
example, during 1972, 1976 and 1979 when silicate 
was drawn down to < 1 µM in the summer, the 
accompanying nitrate drawdown varied 
considerably and the Si:NO
3
 drawdown ratios were 
1.4, 2.5 and 3.6, respectively.  Accompanying 
phytoplankton species composition data could help 
to clarify why these Si/N ratios varied by so much. 
 
In the 1980s–90s, the number of parameters that 
was measured increased, but the temporal 
resolution decreased to two or three cruises per year.  
This may explain why many of the episodic events 
that were observed in the 1960s–70s (e.g., Chl-a 
peaks and silicate drawdowns to < 1 µM) have not 
been observed since that time, except for the 
possible episode in 1983 when the largest particle 
flux to 3800 m sampled to date at OSP, was 
measured (Wong et al., 1999). 
 
Future research should continue regular cruises to 
maintain the priceless time series and include 
moored instruments to increase the temporal 
resolution in order to determine if any episodic 
events are presently occurring.  Since iron limits 
algal growth, the sources of iron for OSP must be 
determined and these sources may be linked to the 
episodic increases in Chl-a or nutrient drawdown 
that were observed in the 1960s–70s (Boyd et al., 
1998b).

The two gyres in the subarctic North Pacific are 
known as the Western Subarctic Gyre (WSG) and 
the Alaskan Gyre (AG).  Comparative studies on 
the primary production of the WSG and AG have 
been carried out in order to understand the different 
effects of iron in these two regions.  Satellite 
monitoring of temporal–saptial variability of the 
chlorophyll a (Chl-a) distribution is very important 
for understanding the role of iron fertilization in 
HNLC (high nutrients, low chlorophyll) waters. 
 
Objectives of this study are:  (1) to find out the 
temporal and spatial variability of Chl-a 
distribution and primary productivity in the 
subarctic North Pacific, and (2) to understand the 
mechanisms regulating Chl-a distribution during 
1996–2000.  We worked with several multi-sensor 
remote sensing data sets, including ocean color by 
OCTS and SeaWiFS, sea surface temperature 
(SST) by AVHRR, and sea surface height by 
TOPEX/Poseidon.  Ocean color and SST images 
were used to study interannual variablity of primary 
productivity and front dynamics.  Sea surface 
height data were applied to study circulation, 
transport and eddy distribution.  In addition to these 
satellite data sets, we generated estimated nitrate 
maps by the algorithm which employs satellite 
Chl-a and SST values.  We attempted to calculate 
primary productivity by the modified Vertically 
Generalized Production Model (VGPM) 
(Behrenfeld and Falkowski, 1997) using ocean 
color and SST satellite data sets.  On the other hand, 
we examined the estimation error of the SeaWiFS 
in-water algorithm using bio-optical data gathered 
by the R/V Mirai and other research vessels.  As a 
result, the SeaWiFS in-water algorithm is working 
well in these regions with the error of less than 40 
percent.  East–west differences and year-to-year 
differences of primary production in the study area 
will be discussed.

The in situ responses of phytoplankton and 
hertertrophic bacteria were followed during the 
mesoscale iron enrichment experiment (IronEx II) 
conducted in the eastern equatorial Pacific during 
May–June, 1995.  The rate of planktonic nitrogen 
(nitrate, ammonium and urea) uptake and the 
abundance and productivity of bacteria were 
measured within the fertilized patch and outside of 
the patch (control) at 15 m depth.  Iron enrichment 
resulted in a dramatic increase in phytoplankton 
biomass (chlorophyll a concentration increased ca. 
20-fold), but in contrast to long-term “grow-out” 
bottle experiments, the ambient nitrate 
concentration did not decrease to near zero, but 
declined by ca. 4–5 μM.  Absolute uptake rates of 
nitrate increased ca. 15-fold as a result of iron 
enrichment, and post-incubation size-fractionation 
experiments demonstrate that larger phytoplankton 
(> 5 μm) were responsible for the enhanced nitrate 
 
utilization (> 85% of the NO
3
 uptake).  Iron 
enrichment shifted the size-structure of the 
phytoplankton community for picoplankton 
dominance to larger cells, and altered the relative 
utilization of new and regenerated N; the daytime 
f-ratio (f-ratio = NO
3
 uptake/total N uptake) 
increased from ca. 0.65 to 0.91 (ratio uncorrected 
for isotopic dilution effects). 
 
The carbon productivity and specific growth rate of 
heterotrophic bacteria increased 3-fold and 3- to 
4-fold, respectively, resulting in the in situ 
accretion of bacteria (abundance increased 
1.7-fold) within the iron patch.  Although these 
results do not demonstrate a direct stimulatory 
response of hetertrophic bacteria to iron enrichment, 
they show that bacterial carbon demand can be 
potentially met by the increase in phytoplankton 
primary productivity.

Introduction 
 
It is recognized that iron plays a key role in 
controlling phytoplankton growth and primary 
productivity in the ocean, especially in HNLC 
(high nutrients, low chlorophyll) regions.  The 
subarctic Pacific Ocean is one of them.  We 
conducted three iron enrichment experiments on 
board in the summer of 1999 at Station Knot (NW) 
and Station P (NE) in the Pacific.  
 
Materials and methods 
 
Iron addition bioassays were conducted during the 
KH99-3 cruise (June 25 to August 25, 1999) of the 
R/V Hakuho Maru, University of Tokyo.  Water 
samples were taken at two stations. The NW station 
(Stn K) and the NE station (Stn P) are located at the 
edge of the Western Subarctic Gyre (NW) and the 
edge of Alaskan Gyre (NE), respectively.  
 
All necessary precautions were taken to prevent 
trace metal contamination throughout the 
preparation and handling. A specially designed 
bellows pump was used for pumping water from  
5 m depth into Nalgene polycarbonate bottles (1 or  
2 L). 
 
The PC bottles were washed by a cleaning 
procedure. The samples were enriched iron as 
FeCl
3
 at the final concentration of 0.3 or 1.0 nM. 
Some samples were also enriched zinc as ZnCl
2
 at a 
final concentration of 1.0 nM. Nothing was added 
to the control bottles. The iron concentrations in the 
control bottles were confirmed to agree with that in 
the original seawater (Obata, pers. comm.).  For the 
one experiment, five bottles were incubated for one 
treatment. The control incubation was conducted in 
duplicate while other treatments were single. The 
bottles were wrapped twice with plastic bags and 
incubated on board for 7 days in a water tank where 
water temperature was maintained to within 2ºC of 
the original temperature. All sample manupulations 
were conducted in a clean bench or clean room 
(Class 100) on board. Surface PAR 
(photosynthetically active radiation) was 
monitored with a 2 π sensor.  
 
Nutrients and size-fractionated chlorophyll a  
(Chl-a) were measured every other day. Samples 
for bacteria and picoplankton counts were also 
taken at the same time. To prevent metal 
contamination, one bottle for each treatment was 
open for each sampling date to take subsamples for 
each measurement. Three different pore size 
nucleopore filters (10, 2 and 0.2 µm) were used for 
size fractionation of Chl-a. Nitrate reductase 
activity (NRA) and alkaline phosphatase activity 
(APA) were also assayed on Day 7. 
 
Shipboard nutrient analyses were perfomed on a 
TRAACS 800 autoanalyzer, according to the 
methods of Grasshoff (1983). Chl-a was extracted 
with N-N, dimethylhormamide (Suzuki and 
Ishimaru, 1980) and measured with a Turner 
AU-10 fluorometer. NRA was assayed on board 
after Berges and Harrison (1995) in duplicate  
500-ml samples on the initial day and on Day 7. 
Enzyme activity was expressed as a product of 
nitrite concentration per unit of volume and time 
(µmol NO
2
 L
–1
 min
–1
) or normalized to Chl-a 
concentration in the sample (µmol NO
2
/µg Chl-a
–1
 
min
–1
).  The APA was measured fluorometrically 
using 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate as a 
substrate (Perry, 1972). 
 
Phytoplankton cell counts were perfomed by light 
microscopy (larger cells: > 10 µm) and flow 
cytometry (smaller cells: < 10 µm).  Samples for 
larger cells were preserved with formaldehyde at 
5% of final concentration and stored at room 
temperature.  Samples for smaller cells were 
preserved with paraformaldehide at 1% of final 
concentration and frozen immediately using liquid 
nitrogen and stored at –80ºC.

Results and discussion 
 
Nitrate and phosphate concentrations at 5 m depth 
for both sites were almost the same, at 11 and  
1.2 µM, while silicate was higher at Stn P (19 nM) 
than at Stn K (15nM).  Total Chl-a concentration 
was slightly higher at Stn K than at Stn P, but both 
were below 0.5 µg L
–1
, indicating both sites were at 
HNLC conditions at the time of the incubation. 
Light irradiance and temperature were not 
significantly different. 
 
At both sites total Chl-a concentration increased 
sharply in the iron-enriched bottles after Day 3  
(Fig. 1).  At Stn K the highest Chl-a concentration 
of 8 µg L
–1
, which was 17 times the initial value, 
was observed in the iron- and zinc-enriched bottle 
on Day 7.  The increase in the bottle at 0.3 nM Fe 
was 4 µg L
–1
, which was half of that at 1.0 nM Fe.  
The control bottles showed little increase in Chl-a 
in 7 days.  The zinc-only addition did not affect 
Chl-a concentration as in the control.  At Stn P the 
addition of iron also stimulated the Chl-a 
concentration to its highest concentration, at  
14 µg L
–1
, which was 52 times the initial value and 
observed in the iron- and zinc-enriched bottle on 
Day 7. The Chl-a concentration in the bottles at  
0.3 nM Fe was almost a half of the 1.0 nM-enriched 
bottle. The control and Zn-only added bottles 
showed a slight increase in Chl-a of up to 3.5 µg L
–1
.  
This increase was 18% of that in the 1.0 nM Fe- 
added bottles.  These results strongly suggested that 
phytoplankton growth at both the NE and NW 
stations were limited by iron deficiency in the 
summer of 1999.  This was supported by the 
evidence that dissolved iron was depleted in the 
surface at both stations (Obata, pers. comm.).

Nutrient concentrations did not change until Day 3, 
but decreased after Day 5, especially for iron-added 
bottles (Fig. 2).  The amounts of nutrient drawdown 
was higher for the 1.0 nM Fe addition than that for 
the 0.3 nM Fe addition and the control. No 
difference in phosphate and silicate concentrations 
on Day 7 was found between 1.0 nM Fe and 1.0 nM 
Fe plus 1.0 nM Zn-added bottles at Stn K, but iron- 
and zinc-added bottles showed higher utilization of 
nutrients at Stn P.  
 
The consumed N:P ratio in the control bottles 
(12.5) was almost same in the iron-added bottles, 
but  the Si:N ratio was 2.4 which was 2.2 times 
higher than in the iron-added bottles.  The ratios in 
nutrient consumption were not different between 
the control and iron-added bottles at Stn P (Si:N 
ratio of 1.23 and 0.97 and N:P ratio of 8.8 and 10.5 
in the control and the iron-added bottles). These 
differences in the consumption ratio of Si:N in the 
control bottles seemed to be derived from the 
different phytoplankton assemblages in each 
station: centric diatom dominance in the NW 
station and pennate diatom and coccolithophorids 
dominance in the NE station.  The centric diatoms 
consumed silicate and nitrate at equimolar amounts 
under iron-replete conditions whereas they 
consumed more silicate than nitrate under 
iron-limited conditions (Takeda, 1998).  Emiliania 
huxleyi are coccolithophorids that achieve their 
maximal growth rate even under iron-limited 
conditions (Muggli and Harrison, 1997).  Thus, at 
Stn K dominant centric diatoms utilized much more 
silicate under iron limitation while at Stn P 
co-existing coccolithophorids and pennate diatoms 
utilized nutrients at a Si:N ratio of 1:1 even if the 
diatoms consumed excess silicate over nitrate, 
because coccolithophorids require only nitrate and 
phosphate as nutrients.   
 
NRA measured on Day 0 at both stations was close 
to the detection limit.  On Day 7, even after 
normalizing to Chl-a (biomass), NRA in the 1.0 nM 
Fe-added bottles showed 4 times higher activity 
than the control. 
 
We also assayed APA which requires zinc for the 
same occasions as the NRA.  None of the samples 
assayed showed detectable APA activity.

Laboratory isolates of heterotrophic bacteria and 
field populations from low-iron waters of the ocean 
are able to take up 
55
Fe from ferrioxamine B, a 
fungal siderophore (Granger and Price, 1999; 
Maldonado and Price, 1999).  Rates of transport are 
up-regulated when ambient iron concentrations are 
low, suggesting that the use of siderophore-bound 
iron is an adaptation to overcome iron limitation.  
Using a non-denaturing PAGE (polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis) assay, we have discovered that the 
laboratory strains produce outer-membrane 
receptors that bind ferrioxamine B when iron is 
limiting growth.  So far we have examined 
Altermonas sp., a clone isolated from waters near 
Station P in the subarctic Pacific Ocean, and PWF3, 
a clone from the Gulf of Mexico.  The receptor is 
absent from cells cultured in a high-iron medium 
and is rapidly induced upon transfer to a low-iron 
medium.  Its apparent molecular weight is roughly 
80 kD, similar in the size to other siderophore 
receptors from terrestrial and pathogenic bacteria.  
We are now characterizing the specificity of the 
receptor(s) by examining binding of other 
siderophores and inorganic iron complexes.  The 
method could be used to examine siderophore 
receptor expression in natural populations of 
bacteria before and during an iron fertilization 
experiment.

Introduction  
 
The relationship between iron dynamics and 
phytoplankton growth is important for the study of 
iron biogeochemistry after iron fertilization.  
Size-fractionated iron analysis will be one useful 
approach for the study of iron dynamics.  Therefore, 
to investigate the size-fraction of supplied iron and 
changes in the concentration of different size fractions 
of iron during phytoplankton growth in open-ocean 
seawater, a combination of measurements of 
size-fractionated iron and concurrent incubation 
experiments was performed at Ocean Station PAPA 
(OSP) in September 1997.  One of the objectives of 
this experiment was to investigate the difference in 
iron size fractions in seawater between artificial 
iron addition and by natural iron supply.   
 
Previous laboratory studies suggested that small 
colloidal particles formed in traditionally dissolved 
fractions (< 0.2 µm) might be one of the available 
iron forms for oceanic phytoplankton, with some 
mechanisms such as cell-surface reduction (Wells 
and Mayer, 1991; Wells et al., 1991; Kuma and 
Matsunaga, 1995; Nishioka and Takeda, 2000).  
Therefore, we investigated changes of 
size-fractionated iron during ambient 
phytoplankton growth by using a combined trace 
metal clean filtration method, which uses a 0.2 µm- 
pore size Teflon membrane filter and a 200-kDa 
nominal molecular weight polyethlene 
hollow-fiber ultrafilter (Nishioka and Takeda, 
2000), and ultra-clean onboard bottle incubation 
experiments.   
 
Method 
      
An onboard incubation experiment was conducted 
on board the R/V J.P. Tully at Ocean Station PAPA 
(OSP: 50°N, 145°W) in September 1997.  Seawater 
samples for vertical profiles of size-fractionated 
iron were collected using Teflon-coated, modified 
30-L Go-Flo bottles suspended on a Kevlar line on 
September 3, 1997.  For the incubation experiment, 
a water sample with resident phytoplankton was 
collected on September 4 from the sea surface and 
transferred to two acid-cleaned 20-L polyethylene 
tanks by rubber boat sampling with clean technique.  
A deep seawater sample was collected from 600 m 
depth using the same method as for the vertical 
sample collection on September 5.  Acid-cleaned 
polycarbonate bottles were used for the incubation 
experiments.  Although the problem with wall 
adsorption and desorption was expected, we 
confirmed that determination of dissolved and 
size-fractionated total acid-labile Fe concentration 
in filtered seawater samples did not significantly 
change in acid-cleaned polycarbonate incubation 
bottles for more than 5 days (Takeda and Obata, 
1995; Nishioka and Takeda, 2000).  We prepared 
three treatments in this incubation experiment.   
 
Control treatment 
 
Surface water was homogenized in a 20-L 
polyethylene bottle, and the water sample for the 
control treatment was then dispensed into eight, 
acid-cleaned, replicate 1-L polycarbonate 
incubation bottles.   
 
Iron addition treatment   
 
The iron-enriched treatment was prepared from 
surface water enriched with a 0.7 nM FeCl
3 
solution 
and dispensed in the same manner as the control 
treatment after homogenization.   
 
Deep water mixed treatment  
 
For the deep water mixed (DWM) treatment, the 
surface water sample was placed in a 20-L 
polyethylene bottle enriched with deep seawater 
(surface water: deep water = 1:2) and then 
immediately homogenized.  This mixed seawater 
was dispensed in the same way as for the control 
124 
treatment.  These preparation procedures were done 
in a clean-air tent.  The 1-L bottles were sealed in 
three plastic bags and then incubated on deck in 
running surface seawater baths to maintain surface 
seawater temperatures for 6 days.  The incubation 
baths were covered with neutral density screens, 
and incubation light intensity was 27% of the 
ambient light level.   
      
During the course of the incubations, two bottles 
for each treatment were withdrawn from the 
incubation bath at Days 2, 4 and 6 and submitted to 
the measurements of nutrients and Chl-a 
concentrations.  Size-fractionated iron in each 
treatment seawater sample was determined on the 
initial and final days.  Measured total labile Fe 
(unfiltered, detectable at pH 3.2) concentrations 
were divided into three size fractions; large labile 
particles (> 0.2 µm), small colloidal particles (0.2 
µm–200 kDa) and soluble species (< 200 kDa).  
Concentrations of Fe (III) in the unfiltered and 
filtered samples were determined with an automatic 
Fe (III) analyzer (Kimoto Electric Co. Ltd.) using 
chelating resin concentration and chemi- 
luminescence detection (Obata et al., 1993, 1997).  
Initial sample bottles (Day 0) were analyzed 
without incubation.  The incubation bottles were 
not repetitively sampled in order to avoid 
contamination during the sub-sampling procedure.  
 
Results and Discussion 
 
Vertical distribution of size-fractionated iron  
 
At OSP, vertical profiles of dissolved Fe  
(< 0.2 µm) exhibited nutrient-like distributions in 
September 1997.  Concentrations of soluble Fe 
were low in the surface mixed layer and increased 
below 300 m depth (~ 0.34 nM, Nishioka et al., 
2001).  The concentrations of small colloidal Fe 
were generally low in the surface mixed layer 
(0.01–0.06 nM) with higher concentrations below 
200 m depth (~ 0.22 nM).  At 600 m depth, small 
colloidal Fe represented 39% of dissolved Fe  
(< 0.2 µm) (Nishioka et al., 2001). 
   
Onboard incubation experiment 
 
Initial concentrations of nutrients, total Chl-a and 
total labile Fe in each treatment incubation bottle 
are shown in Table 1.  In the DWM treatment, iron 
was enriched to 0.35 nM with a high level of 
nutrients.  Both additions of minute FeCl
3
 and Fe in 
deep water to surface seawater samples containing 
excess nutrients increased the stocks of Chl-a in 
incubation bottles relative to the controls (Figs. 1 
and 2).  Total Chl-a concentration in the control 
treatment increased by only 2.2 times the initial 
concentrations during 6 days of incubation.  In 
contrast, total Chl-a concentrations in the iron 
addition treatment and DWM treatment increased 
15 and 27 times, respectively for the initial 
concentrations in the same periods (Fig. 1). 
 
The increase in Chl-a concentrations was 
correlated with major nutrient consumption  
(Fig. 2).  In the iron addition and DWM treatments, 
concentrations of major nutrients were reduced 
significantly more than that of the control 
treatment.  Nitrate concentration decreased only  
0.7 µM in the control treatment, while 6.8 µM and 
4.6 µM, respectively, in the iron addition and 
DWM treatments.  Obviously, the stock of Chl-a 
concentration and nitrate consumption by 
phytoplankton taken from the OSP water increased 
with added FeCl
3 
and deep water.  These results 
strongly suggest that ambient phytoplankton were 
under iron limitation in OSP surface waters.  Also, 
deepwater addition to surface water disarms iron 
limitation of ambient phytoplankton.  This result 
suggests that biologically available iron is included 
in deep water and stimulates phytoplankton growth 
if deep water is supplied from below the mixed 
layer to the surface by upwelling and vertical 
diffusion.

Initial (Day 0) and final (Day 6) size-fractionated 
iron concentrations of all treatments are presented 
in Figure 3.  In the control treatment, total labile Fe 
concentration decreased slightly (0.04 nM) during 
the 6 days, and significant iron remained in the only 
soluble species fraction (0.11 nM) in these bottles 
at end of the incubation.  Total labile Fe 
concentration in the iron addition and DWM 
treatment samples showed large decreases during 
the 6 days’ incubation.  When the FeCl
3
 solution 
was added to the OSP seawater in the iron addition 
treatment bottles, the iron concentration in small 
 
colloidal fraction increased significantly and 
comprised 85 % of the total labile Fe.  Total labile 
Fe concentration decreased from 0.64 to 0.41 nM 
for the 6 days.  Of the size-fractionated iron 
concentrations, small colloidal particles decreased 
significantly (0.43 nM) and 0.21 nM of this fraction 
converted to a large labile Fe fraction during 
incubation.  Soluble Fe species did not significantly 
change on the final day (Fig. 3).  While in DWM 
treatment, iron in the soluble species comprised 
45.7 % of total labile Fe and total labile Fe 
concentration decreased 0.13 nM during 6 days of 
incubation.  Of all the size fractions of iron, the 
soluble Fe species decreased most significantly by 
0.11 nM.  Comparing initial size-fractionated iron 
concentration in the iron addition treatment to the 
control treatment, the small colloidal Fe fraction 
decreased significantly during phytoplankton 
growth and some of the small colloidal Fe 
converted to the other fraction.  The decrease in the 
small colloidal Fe concentration during the period 
of phytoplankton growth represented 
proportionally the greatest decrease in total labile 
Fe. 
 
On the other hand, soluble Fe fraction increased in 
the DWM treatment at the initial stage of 
incubation and decreased during phytoplankton 
growth (Fig. 3).  Comparing the iron addition 
treatment to the DWM treatment, the size fraction 
of supplied iron in seawater and its net change 
during phytoplankton growth were different.  These 
results demonstrate that the size fraction of 
supplied iron in seawater and its net change during 
phytoplankton growth was different between 
different iron sources.

Summary 
 
• When the FeCl
3
 solution was added to the 
surface seawater in the incubation bottle, the 
small colloidal Fe concentration increased 
significantly. 
• The decrease in the small colloidal Fe 
concentration during the period of 
phytoplankton growth represented 
proportionally the greatest decrease in total 
labile Fe. 
• Comparing the iron addition treatment to the 
DWM treatment, the size fraction of supplied 
iron in seawater and its net change during 
phytoplankton growth were different between 
different iron sources. 
• The use of the size-fractionated iron analysis in 
iron fertilization experiments may provide 
important information for understanding iron 
dynamics after iron fertilization.  Studies of iron 
dynamics in natural seawater should be focused 
on iron complexation with organic ligands as 
well as the relationship between changes in 
concentration of small colloidal Fe and 
phytoplankton growth. 
 
Suggestions for iron fertilization experiments 
from this study 
 
• Artificial iron additions result in different iron 
forms compared to the natural iron supply from 
deep water. 
• Wet and dry deposition of atmospheric aerosols 
may have similar characteristics to the small 
colloidal Fe which is caused by artificial iron 
addition. 
• The study of iron dynamics after iron 
fertilization should focus on iron complexation 
with organic ligands as well as small colloidal 
Fe.

The roles of grazers (microzooplankton and 
mesozooplankton) and remineralizers (bacteria and 
heterotrophic nanoflagellates) were estimated 
during a nutrient enrichment experiment using a 
mesocosm.  Primary production increased by about 
11 times during the initial 3 days, and the grazing 
rate by zooplankton also increased by 7.4 times.  
During the initial 5 days, the primary production 
exceeded the grazing rate and after that, almost 
balanced rates were observed.  The biomass peaks 
of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates 
(HNF) were observed after the phytoplankton 
bloom declined.  Bacterial production and HNF 
grazing gradually increased from the beginning to 
the end of the experiment. The contribution of 
microzooplankton to grazing was greatest during 
the initial 7 days, and the response to 
phytoplankton growth was fastest during the same 
period. Heterotrophic dinoflagellates were the most 
dominant component of microzooplankton, but 
naked ciliates showed the fastest growth in 
response to phytoplankton production. Overall, 
microzooplankton grazing contributed the most to 
phytoplankton depletion.  Their response to the 
phytoplankton growth was very quick, and they 
removed about 50% of the primary production 
constantly.  Thus, naked ciliates and heterotrophic 
dinoflagellates were the most plausible organisms 
to realize the steady state of phytoplankton 
concentration in the ocean.  
      
The western subarctic Pacific is characterized by 
relatively high standing stocks of phytoplankton 
and mesozooplankton.  Moreover, the dominance 
of diatoms and the almost complete absence of 
haptophytes characterize the phytoplankton 
community of the western subarctic Pacific Ocean.  
The expected difference in response to iron 
addition by lower trophic organisms between the 
east and west will be discussed.

Modification of the upper ocean occurs through a 
variety of physical processes, including wind and 
buoyancy forcing, advection, and turbulent 
diffusion.  Proposed iron fertilization sites in the 
northwest and northeast Pacific are regions of 
marked upper ocean startification, slow eastward- 
flowing surface currents, and moderately weak 
turbulent dissipation.  Mean surface currents in the 
region range from 1–5 cm/s (approximately 1–4 
km/day) while the mean horizontal eddy viscosity 
ranges from roughly 1.5 × 10
7
 cm
2
/s in the 
meridional direction to 2.5 × 10
7
 cm
2
/s in the zonal 
direction.  Decorrelation time scales for mesoscale 
(10 to 100 km) motions are around 2 to 3 days over 
associated spatial scales of 15 to 30 km.  Although 
tidal currents are weak (diurnal and semidiurnal 
velocities are of order 1 cm/s) passing atmospheric 
fronts can generate strong (up to roughly 50 cm/s), 
rapidly varying currents of 16-h periods that persist 
for several days to a week.  These currents, 
combined with turbulent wind mixing and surface 
buoyancy (heat) flux, lead to short-term (< 1 day) 
variability in the surface mixed layer depth and to 
the formation of seasonal pycnoclines above the 
permanent pycnocline (approximately 100 m 
depth).  The experimental sites may be impacted by 
packets of internal tidal waves formed near the 
Aleutian Islands and by the passage of westward 
propagating mesoscale eddies generated along the 
west coast of North America.  Coupled 
ocean–atmosphere circulation models can assist in 
the retrospective analysis of the iron plume 
dispersion but presently lack the spatial and 
temporal resolution for accurate experimental 
design and prediction.

Introduction 
 
The physical mechanisms that determine the 
dispersion of biological populations in the surface 
ocean confound the determination of the limiting 
parameters and processes.  Interpretation of 
Eulerian time series data is hindered by a lack of 
knowledge of the physical forcing, as any temporal 
change may simply reflect the advection of 
different water bodies past the sampling point.  This 
has been addressed in Lagrangian studies of upper 
ocean biogeochemistry using drifter buoys (Harris 
et al., 1997).  However, wind slippage may reduce 
the correlation between buoy and water body with 
time (Stanton et al., 1998), and drifter buoys are 
also restricted to the air–sea interface and so cannot 
track in the event of subduction.  Dyes have been 
used successfully in dispersion studies (Smart and 
Laidlaw, 1977), but adsorption onto particles, 
toxicity, and limited real-time analytical capability 
restrict their application to short-term coastal and 
shelf seas.  Sulphur hexafluoride (SF
6
) can be used 
for tracking water bodies at the surface over periods 
of 2 weeks (Wanninkhof et al., 1997; Law et al., 
2001), and periods exceeding a year for sub-surface 
releases (Ledwell et al., 1993, 1998).  The benefits 
of SF
6
 include high analytical sensitivity, low 
oceanic and atmospheric background, inertness and 
relatively low price, providing a favourable 
combination for mesoscale tracer studies in the 
open ocean with minimal volumes of SF
6
 (Law et 
al., 1998).  Tagging with SF
6
 permits the 
monitoring of temporal change in a discrete body of 
water, so providing an observational tool for 
constraining biological and biogeochemical 
cycling rates in a non-perturbated system 
(Wanninkhof et al., 1997; Law et al., 1998). This 
capability further permits in situ manipulation of 
the water body, and so ameliorates the limitations 
of marine experimentation experienced in in vivo 
studies.  The use of the tracer in these manipulation 
experiments confirms causality, as initially 
suggested by Watson et al. (1991) and subsequently 
demonstrated in the IronEx and SOIREE (Southern 
Ocean Iron RElease Experiment) studies (Martin 
et al., 1994; Coale et al., 1996; Boyd et al., 2000).  
In the following discussion, the SF
6
 Lagrangian 
framework will be described and the benefits and 
limitations of this approach discussed. 
 
Methods 
 
Analytical methodology 
 
Analytical detection limits of 0.02 fmol/kg  
(1 femtomole = 10
–15
 mol) and an extremely low 
surface water background concentration of  
< 1.4 fmol/l permit mesoscale water mass tracking 
with modest releases of SF
6
 (50–120 g).  The SF
6
 
patch is monitored using two different analytical 
systems for continuous measurement of the lateral 
dispersion at the surface and for discrete water 
sampling of the vertical dispersion.  Both analyses 
are achieved using automated systems 
incorporating sparge-cryogenic trapping and 
detection of SF
6
 by ECD (electron capture detector).  
The discrete system includes pre-sparge vacuum 
injection to accelerate stripping and shorten 
analysis time, a single trapping system, and handles 
large volumes (350 ml) with increased precision 
(<1%) (Law et al., 1994).  The mapping system 
runs continuously, using sample volumes of 180 ml 
and a dual trapping system, with a minor reduction 
in precision and sensitivity (Upstill-Goddard et al., 
1991; Law et al., 1998).  A surface measurement is 
obtained every 3 min which, at a ship speed of 5–10 
kts, gives spatial sampling every 0.45–0.9 km.  
Concentration data are incorporated in near 
real-time into an uncorrected plot of the areal 
distribution of the patch by integrating the SF
6
 
data 
with the ship’s GPS position.  This enables rapid 
alteration to ship speed and direction in response to 
variation in the SF
6
 signal and ensures resolution of 
patch boundaries for determination of the “IN” and 
“OUT” patch sampling stations.  A Lagrangian 
correction accounting for the advection of surface 
waters during mapping is subsequently applied. 
  
 
131 
Tracer release  
 
The SF
6
 saturation, release and surveying 
techniques are described in Upstill-Goddard et al. 
(1991) and Law et al. (1998).  Briefly, a saturated 
solution is prepared by sparging surface seawater in 
a steel tank with pure SF
6
 at a rate of ~120 ml/min.  
SF
6
 saturation is monitored by Thermal 
Conductivity Detector (TCD).  During the release, 
the SF
6
-saturated seawater is pumped out with 
replacement by water above a diaphragm in the top 
of the tank to prevent SF
6 
dilution or degassing.  It 
is then mixed with the iron solution and released at 
mid-depth of the surface mixed layer through the 
outlet of a re-enforced tube which is attached to a 
weighted depressor.  The optimal distance of the 
outlet is ~12–15 m behind the ship, so that the 
tracer/iron solution will be mixed by the prop wash 
while immediate loss of SF
6
 to the atmosphere, 
caused by entrapment of air in the prop wash, is 
minimised.  The release period and ship speed are 
dependent upon length of release track and sea state 
but vary between 3–5 kts and 8–16 h, respectively. 
 
The release is generally preceded by a large-scale 
site survey of at least 50 km
2
 to determine the 
suitability for a tracer experiment.  The site should 
be free from dynamic influences such as fronts, and 
physical, biological and biogeochemical variability 
should be minimal.  Depth of the mixed layer is a 
critical issue, as gas exchange may reduce the SF
6
 
signal rapidly in a shallow mixed layer (<15 m), 
whereas a deep mixed layer may lead to 
over-dilution of the tracer. 
 
Correction for surface water advection is essential 
for the creation of a coherent tracer patch with a 
clearly definable centre.  A dead-reckoning strategy 
was used in the initial tracer release experiments 
(Upstill-Goddard et al., 1991; Law et al., 2001), but 
the advection of the centre-point has been 
monitored more recently using surface drifter 
buoys in more recent experiments.  These drifter 
buoys are equipped with a VHF packet radio which 
communicates the buoy GPS position to the ship at 
short intervals, and the drifter buoy also 
subsequently functions as a locator for mapping 
during excursions outside the patch.  The drifter 
buoys are generally tethered to holey-sock drogues 
centred mid-depth of the surface mixed layer to 
reduce wind-slippage.  However, wind drift may 
still occur, with deviation of the patch and buoy 
tracks on relatively short timescales (Law et al., 
1998; Stanton et al., 1998), although this effect may 
be minimal (Law et al., 2001; Martin et al., 2001) 
(see Fig. 1).

6
 contour plots for each day of survey referenced to the midday GPS 
buoy position from the UK PRIME Lagrangian experiment (Law et al., 2001). 
132 
The SOIREE release was achieved by an expanding 
hexagonal track in a Lagrangian frame of reference 
around a central drifter buoy which updated its 
position every 10 min, with distances of 0.5–0.6 km 
between the expanding tracks (see Fig. 2).  
Re-infusion of iron was achieved using 
ADCP-derived velocities to inform the release 
track, with the SF
6
 signal providing an indicator 
that the iron was added within the patch boundaries. 
This worked successfully during SOIREE as there 
was no need to add further SF
6
 because the signal 
remained high.  It is possible to use this approach 
during re-infusion of both SF
6
 and iron  
(P. Nightingale, pers. comm.), although this runs 
the risk of contamination of the analytical mapping 
system. 
 
Results and discussion 
 
The Lagrangian tracer framework provides an 
“unbounded mesocosm” in situ, so that temporal 
variation can be determined within the same body 
of water, by comparison of the ecosystem response 
to the perturbation at the IN station with the control 
unperturbated OUT station. In addition, 
biogeochemical budgets benefit from concurrent 
determination of physical exchange rates in the 
water column and across the air–sea interface, 
accounting for loss processes and dilution. 
 
 
Air–sea exchange rates 
 
A minor disadvantage in the use of SF
6
 as a tracer is 
its volatility, which reduces the time frame within 
which a surface release can be followed. The loss 
rate of SF
6
 across the air–sea interface is well 
documented (Wanninkhof, 1992; Nightingale et al., 
2000a), and can be estimated prior to release. 
Determination of the transfer velocity, k, in shelf 
seas and the open ocean has been achieved using a 
dual tracer approach of SF
6
 and Helium-3 
(Nightingale et al., 2000a).  Estimates of k, 
obtained from wind-speed parameterisations (Liss 
and Merlivat, 1986; Wanninkhof, 1992) can differ 
by more than than 50%, and so lead to considerable 
variation in the calculated fluxes.  The reliability of 
air–sea fluxes can be improved by concurrent 
determination of k and ΔC gradients for dissolved 
gases, as the k obtained will be representative of in 
situ conditions.  In addition, constraining the 
volatile loss of SF
6
 through the dual tracer approach 
will reduce the errors in the SF
6
 budget and so 
improve dispersal and biogeochemical budgets.  
Furthermore, the addition of He-3 with SF
6
 
provides insight into the impact of other factors 
which influence k.  For example, Nightingale et al. 
(2000b) have inferred from the IronEx II 
observations that the influence of algal blooms 
upon k is negligible.

Lateral mixing and dispersion 
 
Following the release, the total surface area 
occupied by the tracer initially expands rapidly as it 
mixes at the edges with water outside the patch. 
After this initial adjustment, the tracer will be 
normally distributed around the centre, and 
disperses at a slower rate.  Calculation of the 
weighted second moment provides an estimate of 
the radial width of the tracer patch and, assuming 
Fickian diffusion, the lateral diffusivity Ky is then 
equal to half the gradient of the linear increase in 
W
2
 with time (see Fig. 3).  A recent estimate of Ky 
of 4 ± 2 m
2
 s
–1
 during SOIREE in the Australasian 
sector of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current 
(Abraham et al., 2000) was within the range of 
2–16 m
2 
s
–1
 found at length-scale 8 km in dye 
release experiments in shelf seas (Okubo, 1980).  
However, this is lower than observed in previous 
open-ocean surface SF
6
 releases, with a Ky of 22 
±10 m
2
 s
–1
 obtained within an eddy in the North 
Atlantic (Martin et al., 2001) and 25 m
2 
s
–1
 in the 
equatorial Pacific (recalculated from Stanton et al., 
1998). 
 
Dispersion of the tracer is not just determined by 
diffusion.  The spreading rate of a tracer patch in 
the streamline of an anti-cyclonic eddy exceeded 
that calculated from the radial effective horizontal 
diffusivity (Martin et al., 2001), due to 
shear-augmented along-streamline dispersion.  The 
tracer patch area was estimated to increase by 
 
5–26 km
2
 d
–1
, exceeding the surface area of 1.9 ± 
0.86 km
2
 d
–1
 which would result from an effectively 
diffuse dispersion in all directions. 
 
In addition, the patch becomes influenced by strain 
and the length of the patch increases exponentially 
at the rate whereas the width of the patch stabilizes 
at a steady value.  Stretching of the tracer patch 
results from the balance between the thinning effect 
of the strain and the widening tendency of 
diffusion.  In ocean flows the strain is not constant, 
but an effective strain rate may be defined from the 
exponential growth in the length of a patch of 
tracer.  The strength of the stirring in a 
two-dimensional flow can be estimated from the 
dispersion of the tracer, with calculation of an 
effective strain rate γ = (8 ±3) 10
–7
 s
–1
 during 
SOIREE.  This agreed with estimates of γ = 5.8 × 
10
–7
 s
–1 
obtained from the subsequent dispersal of 
the patch as indicated by the chlorophyll 
distribution in satellite images (Abraham et al., 
2000). 
 
Dispersion will also influence any biological and 
biogeochemical variable within the patch the lateral 
and vertical transfer of the tracer provides a 
correction for this dilution.  This was used to 
correct for the decrease in iron concentration due to 
dilution during SOIREE, thereby providing a 
constraint of the non-conservative losses of iron 
(Bowie et al., 2001). 
 
Fig. 3 Changes in the size and shape of the tracer patch during SOIREE.  The width and length of the patch were 
determined by fitting a Gaussian ellipsoid using a least-squares fitting procedure.  A best-fit to the length and width of 
the patch after Day 4 was used to estimate the strain rate and the diffusivity (Abraham et al., 2000).  
134 
Vertical diffusivity rates 
 
The rate of transfer of SF
6
 across isopycnals at the 
base of the mixed layer can provide a temporally 
and spatially integrated estimate of the vertical 
eddy diffusivity, K
z
 (Ledwell et al., 1993, 1998; 
Law et al., 1998, 2001).  The transfer of SF
6
 across 
isopycnals results from the dissipation of turbulent 
kinetic energy by the breaking of internal waves 
and shear instability.  As diapycnal diffusion of SF
6
 
is assumed to be Fickian, the distribution of SF
6
 at 
the base of the mixed layer may be described by a 
one-sided Gaussian curve. K
z
 is then estimated 
from the increase of the second moment, the square 
of the mean width of each profile, with time.  This 
approach is dependent upon the low variability 
across the patch and little variability in the density 
profile.  The propagation of internal waves causes 
variation in the SF
6
 profiles and the tracer 
distribution is referenced to the average 
density-depth profile for the survey period to 
correct for the isopycnal variation.  K
z
 estimates 
derived from SF
6
 tracer distributions vary by 
almost an order of magnitude.  The K
z
 obtained 
from the subducted tracer patch during IronEx I 
was 0.25 cm
2
 s
–1
 at a stable pycnocline (Law et al., 
1998), whereas it was greater (1.95 cm
2
 s
–1
) at the 
weaker pycnocline in a North Atlantic anti- 
cyclonic eddy (Law et al., 2000).  
 
The vertical exchange of nutrients and gases may 
be determined by application of the derived K
z
 to 
the gradient at the base of the mixed layer.  This 
approach provides an independent estimate of new 
production by constraining the transfer of nitrate 
from deep waters, which can be compared with new 
production estimates from in vivo stable isotope 
incubations (Law et al., 1998).  In the Southern 
Ocean, vertical diffusion represents a source of 
dissolved iron, and preliminary estimates of K
z
 
from SOIREE suggest that this pathway is more 
significant than atmospheric input in this region 
(Bowie et al., 2001). 
 
Three-dimensional tracking 
 
IronEx I demonstrated the utility of the SF
6
 tracer in 
that, following subduction beneath a low-salinity 
front, the iron-enriched patch was still tracked by 
the tracer signal. Although sampling capability was 
reduced, as surface mapping was no longer 
practical and the patch has to be located by vertical 
profiling, this response to the iron could still be 
monitored. 
Limitations 
 
The SF
6
 Lagrangian framework places certain 
logistical limitations, although these are minor 
compared with the benefits.  Determination of the 
patch boundaries and identification of the centre 
dominate the programme and prevent continuous 
profiling at the patch centre, although this can be 
resolved by a two-ship exercise.  Site selection may 
be biased by the need to identify a site in which a 
tracer Lagrangian experiment will be sustained, and 
so dynamic regions, such as fronts should be 
avoided.  Similarly, surface mixed layers which are 
too deep, or too shallow, may potentially shorten 
the lifetime of the tracer patch. 
 
A consideration of SF
6
 tracer applications is the 
infrared activity of the SF
6 
molecule, although the 
volume required for a mesoscale surface release is 
minimal when compared with total global SF
6
 
production (2000 tonnes p.a., Ko et al., 1993).  It is 
estimated that the total SF
6
 for a surface tracer 
experiment (including that released during 
saturation) has a radiative forcing equivalent to the 
CO
2
 produced during 1–2 days research ship on 
passage. 
 
Whereas the contribution of surface releases to the 
atmospheric signal is negligible, the background 
SF
6
 signal in the ocean may be influenced in the 
event of subduction. SF
6
 has considerable potential 
as a transient tracer of water mass ventilation and, 
following the stabilisation of the atmospheric CFC 
(chlorofluorocarbon) concentrations (Walker et al., 
2000), offers an alternative approach for tracking 
transport of recently-formed water into the deep 
ocean (Law et al., 1994; Law et al., 2001).  
However, even if subduction of a surface tracer 
patch occurs immediately after release, the impact 
of an additional 50–120 g upon sub-thermocline 
tracer concentrations will be minor, following 
dilution.

Prediction of the physical behavior of released iron by random walk simulation 
during the iron fertilization experiment in the North Pacific

At an iron fertilization experiment, it is important 
to predict the behavior of released iron in the 
surface water.  Its behavior is complex because 
both physical and biogeochemical processes are 
involved.  Simulations of a sulfur hexafluoride 
(SF
6
) tracer release experiment is useful for 
understanding the physical behavior of released 
iron.  The behavior of SF
6
 is controlled by only 
physical processes.   
 
A random walk simulation was employed to predict 
the physical behavior of released SF
6
 in seawater.  
The random walk simulation is one of a number of 
particle tracking methods.  Particles move by 
advection and diffusion in a random walk 
simulation.  Stratification, oceanic currents and a 
diffusion coefficient were the physical conditions 
considered in this simulation.  These conditions 
were set by typical values observed in the 
northwest and northeast Pacific.  The influence of 
initial patterns of released SF
6
 on the behavior of 
iron was also considered in the simulation in order 
to find an efficient release pattern of iron and SF
6
.  
Time scales of this study were 4–5 days, 2 weeks 
and 1 month.  This simulation acquired spatial 
scales that depend on time scales.  As a result of this 
simulation, we would like to propose items of 
observation for simultaneous SF
6 
tracer release 
experiments.  We also performed a random walk 
simulation on the ocean general circulation model 
in the North Pacific.  We found that the water mass 
moved from the northwest Pacific to the northeast 
Pacific by advection over several years.  It suggests 
that the release of large amounts of iron and SF
6 
in 
the northwest Pacific affects conditions in the 
northeast Pacific in several years.

Influence of Cape St. James on currents and eddies in the Gulf of Alaska

Cape St. James lies at the southern tip of the Queen 
Charlotte Islands off the West Coast of British 
Columbia.  The swift tidal streams and strong 
prevailing outflow currents at this cape contribute 
to the Haida Eddies in the Gulf of Alaska, and to 
outflow jets and plumes in the neighboring coastal 
waters.  The waters at the cape itself are rich in 
marine life, and nutrients including iron, due to 
outflow of coastal water, and intense tidal mixing 
that stirs deep nutrient-rich water to the surface. 
Thomson and Wilson (1987) described an 
anti-cyclonic eddy that forms to the southwest of 
this cape, due to tidally rectified outflow currents.  
Crawford et al. (1995) found that wind-forced 
currents enhanced this outflow, especially in winter 
when storms are most intense and frequent. 
Satellite altimetry and infrared temperature 
observations provide additional insight into this 
region. We have re-processed the TOPEX/ 
Poseidon (T/P) and ERS-2 altimetry data using 
tidal constants based on regional tidal models 
(Foreman et al., 2000), and on T/P data themselves 
(Cherniawsky et al., 2001.) We have also searched 
through 10 years of AVHRR measurements from 
NOAA satellites.  In winter, the eddies that form to 
the southwest of Cape St. James often advect 
northward along the West Coast of the Queen 
Charlotte Islands with the prevailing winter coastal 
current.  These anticyclonic eddies eventually 
separate from shore, forming the Haida Eddies, 
which can drift for several years in the Gulf of 
Alaska.  Normally one or two such eddies form 
every winter, with larger eddies forming in major 
El Niño winters.  We also find that Haida Eddies 
may originate along the Northwest Coast of the 
Queen Charlotte Islands, far from Cape St. James, 
supporting the hypothesis that local baroclinic 
instability of coastal currents is another generating 
mechanism for this class of eddies.

1999 Report of the Advisory Panel on Iron Fertilization Experiment in the Subarctic 
Pacific Ocean 
(PICES Eighth Annual Meeting, October 8–17, 1999, Vladivostok, Russia) 
 
 
The Advisory Panel on “An Iron Fertilization 
Experiment in the Subarctic Pacific Ocean” 
(IFEP) met on October 14.  The IFEP 
Co-Chairman, Dr. Shigenobu Takeda, welcomed 
the members of the Panel and observers and 
called the meeting to order.  The agenda was 
reviewed and accepted without changes. 
 
Drs. Takeda and Paul J. Harrison introduced the 
IFEP objectives reflected in the terms of 
reference.  Iron fertilization of HNLC (High 
Nutrients Low Chlorophyll) water is one possible 
approach to remove CO
2
 from the atmosphere to 
combat global warming caused by GHGs.  
Natural iron fertilization has been hypothesized 
to control glacial/interglacial shift in atmospheric 
CO
2
.  Iron fertilization experiments were 
repeatedly done in the equatorial Pacific under 
the IronEx Programs I and II, and recently in the 
Southern Ocean.  The Subarctic Pacific, with 
different biology and unique water structure (e.g., 
strong pycnocline, fresher mixed layer) from the 
other two regions, is the only HNLC region 
without such an experiment to assess the CO
2
 
removal question related to iron.  The Panel will 
(i) examine the reasoning for a subarctic iron 
experiment, the scale disciplines, and resources 
required to ensure success of the experiment, and 
(ii) design the experiment and its timing. 
 
Drs. William Cochlan and Mark L. Wells gave a 
brief overview of IronEx I and IronEx II.  In 
particular, Dr. Wells pointed out the importance 
of understanding the iron chemistry: What 
happens to the iron when it is added?  Does it 
precipitate out? 
 
Dr. Harrison presented physical, chemical and 
biological conditions at Station P, a potential site 
for the iron fertilization experiment in the eastern 
North Pacific.  He also discussed eddies forming 
off the Queen Charlotte Islands in winter and 
whether whey could be used as an iron 
fertilization site.  Dr. Josef Cherniawsky 
provided more details on the physics of the 
eddies.  The IFEP members agreed that additional 
information is required to decide if these eddies 
would be a suitable fertilization site, an 
alternative to Station P.  
 
Dr. Wells suggested that questions be formulated 
in order to test specific hypothesis and then 
decide on needs for the measurements and 
personnel.  The following questions were drafted: 
 
- What are the driving hypotheses for a 
fertilization experiment?  Is it industry driven 
or science driven? 
- What are the motivating questions and what 
are the best ways to answer these questions? 
- How is a fertilization experiment going to 
improve our understanding of the iron 
response and what aspects of the response do 
you want to examine? 
- What will a fertilization experiment tell you 
that the bottle enrichment experiments and 
mesocosm experiments have not? 
- Why conduct an experiment at Ocean Station 
PAPA and the northwest subarctic Pacific? 
- What will it tell you that SOIREE, SOFeX, 
Caruso and IronEx have not told you? 
 
The Panel discussed the analytical resources 
needed to be brought to bear on the problem.  A 
list was created in which all recommended 
measurements were arranged into two groups, 
primary and secondary importance.  The IFEP 
members from each country were requested to 
announce the experiment to colleagues, distribute 
the list and ask who would be interested in 
participating and what they could 
measure/contribute.  A list of suggested 
participants should be sent to IFEP Co-Chairmen 
October 2000.   
 
The Panel reviewed a draft workplan developed 
during 1999 by correspondence.  Presently the 
iron fertilization experiment is planned for 
August 2002 at Station P in the northeast 
subarctic Pacific and May or June 2003 at Station 
KNOT in the northwest subarctic Pacific.  There 
is a chance for a preliminary experiment in spring 
2001 in the northwest subarctic Pacific.  The 
Panel recommends to convene a 2-day planning 
152 
workshop on “Designing the iron fertilization 
experiment in the Subarctic Pacific” 
(co-sponsored by PICES and CRIEPI), prior to 
the PICES Ninth Annual Meeting.  
Co-Convenors are Drs. Shigenobu Takeda 
(Japan) and C.S. Wong (Canada).  The objective 
of the workshop is to initiate planning for 
experiment, including logistics and funding, etc.  
IFEP requests that PICES provide funds for three 
invited speakers to attend the workshop.

The Advisory Panel on An Iron Fertilization 
Experiment in the Subarctic Pacific Ocean 
(IFEP) met in the evening of October 25.  The 
Co-Chairman, Dr. Shigenobu Takeda, welcomed 
the members of the Panel and observers (IFEP 
Endnote 1) and called the meeting to order.  The 
agenda was reviewed and accepted without 
changes. 
 
A 2-day IFEP Planning Workshop on “Designing 
the iron fertilization experiment in the subarctic 
Pacific” was convened in Tsukuba, Japan, prior 
to the PICES Ninth Annual Meeting (October 
19-20, 2000).  A report of the Workshop appears 
as IFEP Endnote 2.  The objective of the 
workshop was to initiate planning for the 
experiment, including logistics, ships, funding, 
etc.  The workshop was very successful thanks to 
19 excellent presentations and spirited discussion 
among 39 participants.  
 
Dr. Takeda introduced the schematic diagram of 
subarctic plankton ecosystem that includes new 
biological and geochemical processes reported 
during the workshop.  He also listed similarities 
and differences in physical, chemical and 
biological characteristics between the eastern and 
western subarctic Pacific.  Such differences have 
a close relationship with the zonal gradients in 
atmospheric iron deposition. 
 
From the results of the workshop, Dr. Paul J. 
Harrison proposed a central hypothesis for the 
iron enrichment experiments in the subarctic 
Pacific.  The hypothesis was adopted by IFEP 
after modification according to the suggestions 
and comments from Drs. Kenneth Coale and 
Phillip W. Boyd, and other members (IFEP 
Endnote 3).  The experiment should be driven by 
a scientific hypothesis and is to test the 
hypothesis on natural ecosystem and 
geochemical cycles, therefore the word 
“fertilization” would be replaced by 
“enrichment”. 
 
IFEP recognizes that it is very important to have a 
close linking between the Canadian and Japanese 
program.  It is considered that scientists and ships 
from both Canada and Japan should perform the 
eastern and western experiments as a 
collaborative program to make the east-west 
comparison stronger by using the same 
methodology and team.  The experiment needs 
the participation of American scientists and ships 
as well as scientists from other PICES countries 
to maintain the international activity achieved 
during the workshop.  Due to the number of 
scientists that is needed to measure a wide variety 
of parameters, the experiment will require more 
than two ships.  The R/V J.P . Tully (Fisheries and 
Ocean Canada) and R/V Kaiyo-Maru (Fisheries 
Agency, Japan) or T/S Oshoro-Maru (Hokkaido 
University, Japan) will be the base ships, both in 
the eastern subarctic experiment in July/Aug 
2002 (Station P) and in the western subarctic 
experiment in August 2003 (45–50°N, 
160–165°E).  The R/V Hakuho-Maru (University 
of Tokyo, Japan) is also available to perform the 
survey for studying the long-term responses in 
October 2003.  A preliminary experiment in the 
western subarctic in June–August 2001 is also 
planning to use the R/V Kaiyo-Maru. 
 
The Panel discussed the timeline of proposals for 
research and ship time.  The IFEP members from 
each country were asked to gather information 
such as what they could measure/contribute to 
prepare the proposals as an international program.  
The information will be distributed to colleagues 
who are interested in participating. 
 
IFEP recommends using a web site on the PICES 
home page to improve communication between 
IFEP members and other scientists (group of 
American scientists) who are proposing to 
participate in the Canada-Japan experiments. 
 
After the successful IFEP planning workshop, the 
IFEP felt strongly that the next step should be to 
convene a half-day mini-workshop or meeting at 
the PICES Tenth Annual Meeting in Victoria.  
This workshop would refine the details of the 
experimental design for 2002 and 2003 with 
information about a preliminary experiment in 
the western subarctic gyre in 2001 and Southern 
Ocean experiments in 2000–2001.

be answered by the in situ iron fertilization 
experiment in the subarctic Pacific;  and

Scientific Sessions 
 
1. General overview of IronEx and SOIREE, 
iron chemistry and biology in seawater 
2. Physics in the North Pacific and Fe addition 
techniques 
3. Biology in the North Pacific and IronEx 
4. Chemistry in the North Pacific and IronEx 
 
The workshop was very successful thanks to 19 
excellent presentations and the spirited 
discussion from the 39 participants. 
 
What do we know from IronEx I and IronEx 
II and SOIREE, etc.? 
 
• Iron limitation is clearly present in 
populations of phytoplankton in HNLC 
regions. 
• Iron enrichment de-couples larger 
phytoplankton from the meso-zooplankton 
community. 
• Evidence for carbon export in SOIREE is not 
clear. There may have been export of carbon, 
yet retention of iron. Evidence for carbon 
export in IronEx is clearer.  
• Response in SOIREE was much slower than 
the response in IronEx. 
• There is now more interest in the effect of 
iron enrichment in different 
macro-nutrient-limited regimes, specifically 
in low NO
3
 regimes where N-fixation 
dominates N-uptake. 
• A ship-based study of light limitation of iron 
enrichment in the SOIREE region showed 
that light limitation is present at 100 m. 
• There is some interest in long-term addition 
experiments of low levels of iron. 
• The role of meso-scale eddies is intriguing at 
Station P.  They may offer a way to track a 
patch of water for years, but the 
phytoplankton community in an eddy may be 
atypical of the Gulf of Alaska.  Eddies also 
have no surface water expression and so their 
relevance to an iron enrichment experiment 
is not clear. 
 
155 
• The European community has just sent the 
Polarstern to the southern ocean (in the 
Atlantic sector) to do a SOIREE-type 
experiment over a longer time (CARUSO).   
 
What do we still need to know? 
 
• There is a need to study Station P and the NW 
Pacific, but other regions need to be studied 
as well. 
• The fate of primary production (carbon): 
POC export flux, DOC, respiration and 
response of higher trophic levels (is there an 
increase in fish production?). The time scale 
is over a year, so the model approach is 
needed). 
• What are the roles of ligands?  What 
members of the community produce and take 
up ligands?  
• Does zinc affect other enzyme processes? 
• Need DMS/DMSP studies and other climate 
change biogases. Previous iron enrichment 
studies have measured DMS production.  
Should have both ships and aircraft for 
sampling. At Station P, ocean levels of DMS 
are very high and atmospheric levels are low. 
• Need to know the factors that influence the 
carbon-to-nutrient and other trace metal 
export ratios. 
• Iron might end up below the mixed layer 
during long-term commercial projects. It 
might become available the next summer 
after winter mixing. 
• Would long-term iron enrichment drive a 
system toward another limitation (N, Si, Zn, 
Co, etc.)? 
• What is the impact of long-term iron 
enrichment on fish? Governments may see 
the fish production as a secondary benefit of 
the iron enrichment, so this question will be 
asked. The public may see this as a problem, 
due to “wrong” species benefiting, such as 
pennate diatoms that produce domoic acid.  
(These are not questions that can be 
addressed with the current experiment.) 
• What are the chemical processes associated 
with iron saturation and super-saturation of 
seawater? 
• How does Fe(II) stay around so long in Fe 
enrichment patches? 
• What are the major grazers on diatoms and 
how do they respond when diatom 
(pennate/centric) abundance increases? 
• Understanding the dynamics of plankton 
ecosystem, export carbon flux and climate 
related gases to the iron enrichment is 
appropriate for the requests of Government 
and Industry who are seeking scientific 
information to asses the effect on future 
global atmospheric CO
2
 and environmental 
impacts.  
 
What do we hope to learn from an iron 
enrichment experiment at Station P and 
WSG? 
 
What are the similarities and differences in the 
plankton ecosystem response to iron fertilization 
in the subarctic Pacific?  There is a special 
interest in the east-west North Pacific 
comparison, which includes differences in 
dominant species (pennate/centric diatoms) and 
export flux (Org-C/Opal/CaCO
3
). 
 
Canadian program (extracted from the 
Canadian SOLAS proposal) 
 
Canadian scientists are proposing to fertilize a 64 
km
2
 patch of ocean near Stn P in the NE subarctic 
Pacific during July/Aug 2002.  Iron will be added 
3 or 4 times during the three week experiment 
and a wide variety of physical, chemical and 
biological parameters will be measured.  In 
particular, the expected increase in 
phytoplankton biomass and the subsequent 
carbon flux out of the photic zone, the drawdown 
in CO
2
, and the production of other climate 
change gases such as DMS will be carefully 
documented. 
 
There are several reasons why an iron enrichment 
experiment should be conducted at Stn P in the 
NE subarctic Pacific.  Station P or Ocean Station 
Papa (50°N 145°W) has a 40-year time series of 
physical, chemical, and biological parameters 
and thus it has one of the longest open ocean time 
series in the world.  Three large intensive 
sampling programs have provided detailed 
information, especially on biological rate process 
studies (SUPER, WOCE, and Canadian JGOFS).  
This large published data set/time series will 
provide an excellent background to assess the 
annual and interannual natural variability for 
evaluating the magnitude of the response to the 
156 
iron addition experiment.  The subarctic North 
Pacific represents a latitudinal gradient between 
the polar (Southern Ocean) and equatorial 
regions and therefore an iron addition experiment 
at Station P will allow a comparison among the 
three large HNLC regions and between the 
eastern and western gyres in the subarctic Pacific. 
 
The subarctic NE Pacific has different physical, 
chemical and biological properties than the other 
two HNLC regions (Southern Ocean and 
Equatorial Pacific).  In particular, it has a very 
shallow summer mixed layer depth, a strong, 
shallow pycnocline and low currents which 
should help to keep the iron patch intact and 
ensure the success of the experiment.  The 
biodiversity of the plankton is different from the 
equatorial Pacific and Southern Ocean and 
therefore the response to the iron addition and the 
flux of carbon out of the photic zone may be 
different. 
 
Unlike the equatorial Pacific, Station P is in close 
proximity (3 days) to major research laboratories 
at the Institute of Ocean Sciences and the 
University of British Columbia and therefore it 
should be easier to document the longer term 
recovery from the iron addition.  If the detailed 
documentation of the ecosystem response to a 
singe iron addition is successful, this will allow 
us to proceed to the next phase, repeated iron 
additions and the longer term monitoring that this 
will require. 
 
Key questions that have not been entirely 
resolved by previous iron enrichment 
experiments, are:  
1. How does the change in biodiversity and 
foodweb structure differ for markedly 
different ecosystems which have been 
perturbed by an iron addition?  
2. What is the drawdown of CO
2
 and especially 
the flux of carbon to the deep ocean? 
3. How does the production of ligands influence 
the iron chemistry and the longevity of the 
phytoplankton bloom? 
4. How does zooplankton grazing influence the 
formation of the bloom and the carbon flux 
(e.g., fecal pellet production)? 
5. What is the long-term response and recovery 
of the ecosystem following an iron addition? 
6. What is the magnitude of production of other 
climate change gases such as DMS during 
the bloom and how is the production 
influenced by phytoplankton species, 
microbial processes and grazing? 
 
Objectives 
1. To measure the response of bacteria, 
phytoplankton and zooplankton in terms of 
species, standing stocks and rate processes to 
the iron addition. 
2. To measure the drawdown of CO
2
 and the 
flux of carbon to depth. 
3. To study the relationship between ligand 
production and the associated changes in the 
iron chemistry and their influence on the 
longevity of the phytoplankton bloom. 
4. To assess the influence of zooplankton 
grazing on the phytoplankton bloom 
formation and carbon flux. 
5. To follow the long-term response and 
recovery of the phytoplankton bloom. 
6. To quantify the production of various climate 
change gases during the iron enrichment 
experiment and assess the factors which 
influence the production of these biogases. 
 
Biological oceanographic sampling 
The upper 150 m will be sampled vertically (6–8 
depths) each day using 12 acid-cleaned PVC 
samplers on a CTD/water sampler rosette system 
at the patch center (determined by SF
6
 levels) and 
in the surrounding waters. Real-time vertical 
profiling of temperature, salinity, transmissivity, 
chlorophyll a fluorescence and underwater 
irradiance (PAR, 400–700 nm) will be carried out.  
Discrete water samples will be analysed for: 
• chlorophyll a (size-fractionated, >20, 5–20, 
2–5 and 0.2–2 µm) 
• heterotrophic bacterial abundance 
• microzooplankton abundance 
• phytoplankton abundance (flow cytometry, 
epifluorescence and light microscopy).  
Additional samples will be incubated on deck to 
measure rates of: 
• primary production (14°C, 24 h incubation, 
simulated in situ and size-fractionated as for 
Chl-a) 
• bacterial production 
• microzooplankton grazing 
 
Mesozooplankton abundance will be assessed 
from 150–0 m vertical hauls. The Th:U activity 
ratio of particles in the upper water column will 
 
157 
be collected using a submersible pumping 
system. 
 
Geochemical measurements 
Two types of sampling will be done: hydrocasts 
and underway sampling from the vessel’s 
non-toxic seawater supply (intake 5 m 
subsurface) and analysed by fluorometry 
(calibrated with discrete chlorophyll a samples 
every two days, corrected for quenching during 
daylight hours), and using a bubble-segmented 
automated nutrient analysis system, respectively.  
Underway samples for dissolved iron will be 
conducted from a clean towed batfish sampling 
system, and samples for pCO
2
 will be drawn from 
the vessel’s non-toxic seawater system.  
Phytoplankton samples for the single-cell 
flavodoxin assay will be pre-concentrated 
onboard ship and later analysed shoreside.  
Sampling will be conducted by:   
• Towed batfish:  Continuous sampling will be 
made from a towed batfish with a clean pump 
and tubing for the following measurements  
(This is not a pumping undulating fish): 
- Conductivity/salinity sensor 
- SF
6
 
- fCO
2
, pH 
- nitrate 
- iron 
- chlorophyll a (fluorometer) 
 
• Hydrocasts by rosette CTD/Niskin samplers: 
- T, S 
- O
2
 
- Chlorophyll a 
- Macro-nutrients (N, P, Si) by 
auto-analyzer 
- Iron by chemiluminescence  
- Particulate iron size-fractions, total iron, 
dissolved iron 
- SF
6
 
- DIC, TA, pH 
- DOC, DON, POC  
- DMS 
 
• Free-drifting sediment traps (at 50 m 
intervals, 50–600 m) deployed and retrieved 
at 3 day intervals to obtain samples for 
detritus organic C, N, P, Si, PIC, Fe, Cd, Al, 
rare earth elements, Th/U ratios, 
coccolithophore counts, and planktonic 
species, and scanning electron microscope 
pictures. 
• Deckboard perturbation experiments: 
Algal carbon, growth rates and C:Chl-a 
ratios, etc. 
 
Drs. Wong and Harrison hope to have one or two 
strings of moored sediment traps, plus free 
floating traps. Moored traps would be at the 
control site.  Floating traps would hopefully 
follow the patch.  It will be difficult to keep the 
patch and traps together, but there is a real need 
for trap data to try to quantify and characterize 
export.  Free-floating sediment traps may 
perform differently than moored traps.  Therefore 
we should have free-floating traps in and out of 
the Fe patch. 
 
There is a need to know more about 
micro-zooplankton and to know the effects of 
ligands and climate change biogases (including 
but not limited to DMS, CO
2
, N
2
O).  SOIREE 
showed enhancement of nitrous oxide at the top 
of the thermocline.  There will be aircraft-based 
sampling of gases and aerosols above the Fe 
patch.  The experiment expects to have access to 
the R/V J.P. Tully for 4 weeks, but anticipates 
sampling over a longer time if back-to-back 
cruises using a second vessel can extend 
sampling over 6 weeks.  Cruises could be 
separated by several weeks if the patch could be 
found on the second cruise. Iron limitation at 
Station P in July to August is severe, so the 
project will be conducted during this period.  The 
project will be part of the Canadian SOLAS 
project. 
 
Summary of Japanese programs 
 
Japanese scientists are proposing to conduct a 
preliminary experiment of about 40 days duration 
in June–August 2001, using the R/V Kaiyo-Maru 
in the Western Subarctic Gyre.  The next effort is 
anticipated for August to mid-September 2003 
using either the R/V Oshoro-Maru or the R/V 
Kaiyo-Maru to initiate the SF
6
/Fe patch and 
conduct the basic study.  In October 2003, the 
R/V Hakuho Maru will be used for intensive 
sampling and measurements and assessing 
long-term responses.  Sampling will occur in the 
Western Subarctic Gyre in the region 45–50°N, 
160–165°E: 
1. To measure the response of bacteria, 
phytoplankton and zooplankton in terms of 
species, standing stocks and rate processes to 
158 
the iron addition; 
2. To measure the drawdown of CO
2
 and the 
flux of carbon export; 
3. To study the interaction between 
biogeochemical processes in the surface 
water during the phytoplankton bloom and 
the production of climate gases in the 
atmosphere; 
4. To study the relationship between 
phytoplankton (diatom) production and the 
higher trophic level (salmon);  and  
5. To assess the influence of iron supply on the 
characteristics of the plankton ecosystem in 
the western subarctic Pacific. 
 
The proposal would be funded by: 
• The Science and Technology Agency 
(2001–2005); 
• Ministry of Education, Science and Culture 
(2001 Basic Science, 2002–2004 Scientific 
project with high priority); 
• NEDO grant. 
 
Japan SOLAS is still in the preparation stage.  A 
study of the influence of natural atmospheric iron 
supply on the characteristics of the plankton 
ecosystem in the western subarctic Pacific will be 
one of the important topics.  (Long cruise staying 
at a station in the high dust season in spring.) 
 
 
United States, SOFEX (by Kenneth Coale) 
 
• Experiment will be along 170° west, near 
SO-JGOFS site. 
• Experiment will use SeaSoar type of device 
that pumps water to ship. 
• SO-JGOFS found a jump in silicate at Polar 
front near 62°S, with increase south of front.  
SOFEX will do experiments N and S of front, 
to see which type of species is enhanced in 
each region (Phaeocystis and diatoms). 
• Big complement of scientists and studies.  
There are ten more scientists than berths on 
ship. Lack of ship bunks is a general problem 
in iron enrichment cruises.  For example, 
samples will be frozen for later analysis by 
Edie Rue and will run the only ligand study. 
• SOFEX will need to find the northern patch 
after a week or more, and plan to use 
Lagrangian drifters to keep track of the patch.  
 
Methodology 
• Need to standardize sampling methods to 
enable comparison among experiments in 
different HNLC regions.  List of dominant 
species and their biomass is useful for the 
comparison.  Export production is difficult to 
get quantitative samples? 
• First step is the application of previous 
IronEx methodology (FeSO
4
, initial 
concentration level, Fe infusion timing, etc.) 
and then we may go to new method such as 
the use of chelated iron (iron lignite), 
long-period and low-level iron supply, etc. 
• Should add DMSP to list of samples.  
• Micro-zooplankton are important grazers and 
dilution experiments are necessary to 
quantify coupling of primary production and 
grazing. 
• Fe organic ligand study has technical 
problems. 
• Analyses of biogases in the atmosphere are 
important, but how? 
• Bag experiments have limitations.  Small 
bags might not represent the ocean.  Large 
bags are too difficult to manage.  However, 
there should be some role for bag 
experiments. 
• Use of organic chelated iron (iron lignite) 
may provide carbon source for hetero-trophic 
organisms. 
• Stable isotope study will be done in SOFEX 
to see the proxy of paleo-oceanographic 
environment. 
• After silicate in surface water will be used up, 
a re-infusion of Fe will give us some idea of 
the long-term change in dominant species. 
 
Logistics issues 
• The Station P project needs a second ship.  
Kenneth Coale recommended that a U.S. ship 
may be available if a group of American 
scientists were to propose to participate.  The 
U.S. SOLAS program would be one way to 
generate support. It would help to have a 
Canadian–Japanese proposal ready.  U.S. 
scientists must start to prepare proposals now 
for Station P 2002 cruise. 
• A Canadian or U.S. airplane would be useful 
for tracking the Fe patch.  An airplane with a 
hyperspectral sensor would be really useful. 
• ADEOS-2 will be launched soon.  It will be 
useful (similar to SEAWIFS).

IFEP Endnote 3 
Proposed experimental summary 
 
The North Pacific is characterized by relatively 
uniform distributions in temperature, salinity, 
macronutrients and light yet strong zonal 
gradients in atmospheric iron deposition exist 
between the eastern and western gyres.   
 
We hypothesize that: 
1. The difference in episodic iron deposition 
gives rise to distinct phytoplankton 
communities that characterize these 
biogeochemical provinces. 
2. The biogeochemical response of any given 
province (air–sea flux of biogases, export 
flux of carbon) is driven by episodic events 
such as iron deposition.   
 
To test these hypotheses (and offers as part of this 
program) an iron perturbation experiment, on the 
scale of the entire community is required such 
that the community response and resultant 
geochemical signal can be measured. 
 
Scientific questions 
 
• What is the fate/longevity of the bloom with 
an emphasis on ligand production and the 
response of the grazers (micro and 
mesozooplankton)? 
• What is the magnitude and characteristics of 
particles (Carbon flux) sinking at the end of 
the bloom? 
• What is the production of various climate 
change biogases (DMS, N
2
O, methane, etc.) 
during and after the bloom?

 2001 Report of the Advisory Panel on Iron Fertilization Experiment in the Subarctic 
Pacific Ocean 
(PICES Tenth Annual Meeting, October 5–13, 2001, Victoria, Canada) 
 
 
The meeting was held from 08:30–17:30 hours 
on October 6, 2001.  The Co-Chairman, Dr. C.S. 
Wong, called the meeting to order and welcomed 
the participants (IFEP Endnote 1).  The Advisory 
Panel reviewed the draft agenda and it was 
adopted (IFEP Endnote 2).  The meeting focused 
mainly on the results of the successful Japanese 
iron enrichment experiment in July 2001, and 
planning for the Canadian SOLAS iron 
enrichment experiment to take place at Station P 
in July 2002. 
 
Summary of Japanese iron enrichment 
experiment in the western subarctic Pacific  
 
A preliminary iron enrichment experiment was 
conducted during the FRV Kaiyo-Maru cruise in 
June–August 2001.  The next larger scale 
experiment in the western gyre is planned for 
August–September 2003. 
 
Five goals of the overall project were: 
1. to measure the response of bacteria, 
phytoplankton, and zooplankton in terms of 
species, standing stocks and rate processes to 
the iron addition; 
2. to measure the draw-down of CO
2
 and the 
carbon export flux; 
3. to study the interaction between 
biogeochemical processes in the surface 
water during the phytoplankton bloom and 
the production of climate gases in the 
atmosphere; 
4. to study the relationship between 
phytoplankton (diatom) production and the 
higher trophic level (salmon);  and 
5. to assess the influence of atmospheric iron 
supply on the characteristics of the plankton 
ecosystem in the western subarctic Pacific. 
 
This first iron enrichment experiment was rather 
rushed since funding was received in February 
2001, the ship allocated in April, and the 
experiment conducted in June.  It included only 
16 scientists.  The experiment provided the most 
dramatic phytoplankton response of any of the 
HNLC iron enrichment experiments done to date. 
Overview of the Subarctic Pacific Iron 
Experiment for Ecosystem Dynamics Study 
(SEEDS 2001) 
 
Experiment 
An in situ iron enrichment experiment was 
conducted in the western subarctic gyre of the 
North Pacific (48.5°N, 165°E) from July 18 to 
August 1, 2001.  The experiment consisted of a 
single addition of 350 kg of iron as FeSO
4
 with an 
inert tracer gas SF
6
, over an 8 × 10 km patch with 
a mixed layer depth of 10 m.  The iron release 
track was up and down along a north/south line 
generating a radiator pattern relative to the 
central buoy due to surface currents.  The 
injection was completed on July 19, and followed 
by two weeks of observations.  The patch moved 
~ 100 km from the beginning to the end.  Drogues 
were used to follow the patch for ~ 24–48 h, and 
were repositioned every two days. 
 
Iron 
Prior to release, dissolved iron concentrations in 
the ambient surface seawater were extremely low 
(<0.05 nM).  At the first underway transect 
throughout the patch after the iron release, 
significant increase of dissolved iron (1.9 nM, 
mean value calculated using all measurements of 
first underway transect in the patch; maximum  
6.0 nM) was observed, and most of dissolved iron 
was in the colloidal fraction in the mixed layer.  
Dissolved iron concentrations subsequently 
decreased rapidly, and the loss rate gradually 
decreased.  High particulate iron concentrations 
(>1 nM) were observed throughout the 
experiment. 
 
Biological responses 
The first biological response to the iron 
enrichment was the increase in photochemical 
quantum efficiency (F
v
/F
m
) of phytoplankton on 
day-3 from the enrichment.  Chlorophyll a 
increased from day-6 and reached 20 mg m
–3
 on 
day-10.  The maximum differences between 
outside and inside the patch were 19.5 mg m
–3
 in 
chlorophyll a, and 11.7 μM in nitrate.  Dominant 
phytoplankton species before the fertilization and 
162 
outside the patch was the pennate diatom 
Pseudoniztschia pungens.  But in the patch, 
phytoplankton rapidly increased and large-sized 
(>10 μm) centric diatoms, mainly Chaetoceros 
debilis, were observed.  Non-depletion in nitrate 
until the end of the observation, and shallower 
euphotic layer depth than the mixed layer 
observed on day-12, suggested that 
phytoplankton was light-stressed at the end of the 
experiment.  Salmon and small squid abundance, 
collected by trawl sampling, were not changed 
between inside and outside of the patch, but 
northern mackerels were abundantly collected 
only in the patch. 
 
pCO
2
 
The underway pCO
2
 system with high 
measurement frequency (1-minute interval data 
logging) with real-time monitor facilitated 
tracing the enrichment patch with biological 
draw-down of pCO
2
.  The pre-experiment 
condition of the iron enriched area showed 
uniform pCO
2
.  The change of pCO
2
 inside the 
patch was observed after 5 days of the iron 
enrichment.  The draw down of pCO
2
 expanded 
up to 146 μatm after 11 days of the enrichment. 
 
Export flux 
 
Export flux was measured using drifting 
sediment traps (Knauer type).  The depths of the 
traps were 20, 40, 60, 100 and 200 m from the sea 
surface.  The trap inside the patch was applied 
and recovered at about 2-day intervals.  The 
reference trap outside the patch was applied and 
recovered at about 4-day intervals.  The majority 
of the trapped material was fecal pellets of 
zooplankton.  Increase of export flux was 
observed after 7 days of the enrichment.  
Wind-driven deviation of the inside-patch trap 
occasionally occurred, which made it difficult to 
estimate the export flux accurately, however, the 
increasing export flux inside the trap was 
apparent.  Longer observation of the 
iron-enriched patch is needed to see the fate of 
accumulated organic carbon after the end of 
diatom blooming. 
 
Bottle incubation experiments 
Bottle incubation experiments on board were also 
conducted to elucidate the effects of iron 
concentration and temperature on the growth of 
phytoplankton and nutrient utilization.  
Subsurface seawater samples taken on day-2 
were spiked with FeCl
3
 ranging from 0 to 2 nM, 
and incubated at 5, 9, 13 and 18°C for 14 days.  
The bottle incubation revealed that the increase in 
chlorophyll a was almost the same between in 
situ and in vitro, but the draw-down of nutrients 
was much faster in vitro than in situ.  The specific 
growth rate increased with the amount of spiked 
FeCl
3
, and was also the function of incubation 
temperatures.  
 
Planning session for Canadian SOLAS iron 
enrichment experiment in July 2002 
 
Key issues to focus on in this experiment are: 
 
1. What is the influence of Fe enrichment on the 
production of climate active gases?  This is 
the central novelty of the Canadian SOLAS 
iron enrichment project. 
2. What is the fate of carbon and carbon export?  
This question is also central to SOLAS 
because of CO
2
 flux, and it is of general 
interest because of poorly restrained export 
in previous iron enrichment experiments. 
3. What is the plankton community’s 
(ecosystem) response to iron enrichment? 
4. What happens with iron chemistry, ligand 
production, and fate of iron? 
 
Discussions centered on technical preparations 
such as iron and SF
6
 tanks, drogues, iron 
injection and following the patch. 
 
Overview of NSF proposal  
 
Scientists from the U.S.A. would like to take part 
in both the east and western gyre iron enrichment 
experiments.  The highlights of the proposal 
submitted to NSF are as follows: 
• Characterize the community and water 
chemistry within and adjacent to the 
iron-enriched patch over a time period of 
several weeks (20–50 days) after the initial 
enrichment; 
• Test a series of sub-hypothesis using on-deck 
incubation studies; 
• Assess the phenotypic differences of 
newly-isolated dominant subarctic Pacific 
diatoms in laboratory culture experiments;  
and 
• Model the planktonic response to changes in 
iron concentrations and chemical speciation 
 
163 
in the iron-enriched patch over a time period 
of several weeks after the initial fertilization. 
 
Should we establish a SOLAS component of 
PICES? 
 
Discussions focused on a proposal for an iron 
working group since the iron work was underway, 
and would benefit from a North Pacific 
coordinated effort leading to conclusive results 
and inter-gyre comparisons in the next three 
years.  The idea of an iron working group was 
presented to the CCCC Implementation Panel, 
but it was not put forward to the Science Board.

2002 Report of the Advisory Panel on Iron Fertilization Experiment in the Subarctic 
Pacific Ocean 
(PICES Eleventh Annual Meeting, October 18–26, 2002, Qingdao, China) 
 
 
The meeting was held from 08:30–17:30 hours 
on October 19, 2002.  Co-Chairman Dr. 
Shigenobu Takeda called the meeting to order 
and welcomed the participants (IFEP Endnote 1).  
The Advisory Panel reviewed the draft agenda 
and it was adopted (IFEP Endnote 2).  The 
meeting focused mainly on the preliminary 
results of the successful iron enrichment 
experiment in the eastern subarctic Pacific in 
July–August 2002. 
 
Activities in 2002 
 
Eastern subarctic Pacific 
An in situ iron enrichment experiment in the 
eastern subarctic Pacific, SERIES (Subarctic 
Ecosystem Response to Iron Enrichment Study), 
was conducted in July–August 2002, as a part of 
the Canadian-SOLAS project. 
 
SERIES scientific objectives 
 
• Community response to iron addition 
(comparison with other HNLC regions such 
as Eq Pacific, S Ocean, NW Pacific); 
• Natural longitudinal dust/Fe gradient from 
Western Subarctic Gyre to Alaska Gyre; 
• Fe chemistry and complexing agents; 
• Carbon export – needs > 30 days to see; 
• Trace gas production e.g., DMS and organic 
halides. 
 
SERIES implementation - three ships 
• CSS John P. Tully (Canada):  pre-injection 
survey, patch mapping, buoy handling, 
underway sampling, nutrients, sediment 
traps; 
• M/V El Puma (Mexico, chartered by 
Canada):  atmospheric and ocean process 
studies (gas production, DMS, DMSP, 
grazing, BP, PP, Chl, zooplankton, etc.); 
• M/V Kaiyo Maru (Japan):  mapping, pCO
2
, 
sediment traps, nutrients, BP, PP, Chl, 
foodwebs, taxonomy. 
 
Experiment and preliminary results 
An in situ iron enrichment experiment was 
conducted in the northeast subarctic Pacific near 
Station P26 – Ocean Station Papa (50ºN, 145ºW).  
Site selection was based on the location of waters 
with low density, uniform physical characteristics, 
the predominant direction of the drogued drifter 
buoys, and matching the HNLC condition.  There 
was evidence of two eddy-like features, 
southwest and northeast of P26, that was taken 
into consideration. 
 
The first iron release was performed from 
01:05–18:45 hours on July 7, 2002.  The SF
6
 and 
iron solutions were mixed and pumped over the 
side at rate of 5 and 20 liters/min to a depth of 
about 7 m as maintained by attachment of the 
outlet to a Hi-Fin fish.  The release track was an 
expanding square covering 4.75 × 4.74 n miles, 
with a distance between transects of 0.4 n miles.  
Some of the initial values for reactive and 
unfiltered iron were in the 4 nM range, while 
dissolved iron concentration was as high as 
2.5 nM.  Values declined very quickly over the 
first few days in the surface mixed layer of 10 m.  
Winds and rough seas mixed the iron down 
uniformly to about 30 m on July 13 to 14.   
 
Re-infusion of iron was performed from 14:45 
hours on July 16 to 08:00 hours on July 17, 2002.  
An expanding rectangle was used for the 
re-infusion with the SF
6
 mapping system used to 
monitor the release.  The second smaller injection 
brought levels up to 0.6–0.7 nM for dissolved Fe 
in the 3–10 m depth on July 17.  By July 22, 
dissolved iron concentrations were very close to 
background. 
 
Rapid and small initial responses were observed 
in phytoplankton.  As the experiment progressed, 
the biological response, such as increases in 
F
v
/F
m
, primary productivity and Chl-a 
concentration and decreases in macronutrient 
concentrations, became apparent.  This was also 
augmented by underway pCO
2
. 
 
The phytoplankton bloom peaked 
physiologically around July 21, primary 
production peaked on July 24, and Chl-a peaked 
on July 24–26 and reached 8 mg m
–3
. 
166 
Concentration of Chl-a then decreased gradually 
to 1.5 mg m
–3
 on August 4.  The most dominant 
phytoplankton at the Chl-a peak were centric 
diatoms, and many pennate diatoms were also 
observed.  Exhaustion of iron and macronutrients 
seems to be one of the reasons for the termination 
of the bloom.  Sinking particles gradually 
increased after July 31. 
 
Western subarctic Pacific 
The Panel reviewed the results of the Japanese 
iron enrichment experiment in the western 
subarctic Pacific – SEEDS 2001 (Subarctic 
Pacific Iron Experiment for Ecosystem 
Dynamics Study).  These results will be 
published as a special issue of Progress in 
Oceanography.  The Panel discussed the plans 
for the second longer-term (>30 days) experiment 
in this area in July–August, 2004. 
 
Scientific objectives for SEEDS 2004 
• Observe the decline of the diatom bloom and 
elucidate the fate of fixed carbon; 
• Measure additional parameters to see the 
overall biogeochemical responses to iron 
enrichment; 
• Determine the influence of Fe on trace gas 
production and aerosol formation; 
• Measure gas fluxes from ocean surface to 
atmosphere. 
 
Scientists from the U.S.A. are planning to take 
part in the longer-term experiment in the western 
gyre, and the proposal submitted to NSF was 
presented. 
 
Proposed activities in 2003 
 
IFEP proposes a 3-day workshop on In situ iron 
enrichment experiments in the eastern and 
western subarctic Pacific, to be held December 
4–6, 2003, at the Institute of Ocean Sciences in 
Sidney, British Columbia, Canada. 
 
Specific objectives of the workshop are: 
• Synthesize results from two in situ iron 
enrichment experiments performed in the 
eastern and western subarctic Pacific 
(SEEDS-2001 and SERIES); 
• Discuss responses in lower and higher 
trophic levels, carbon cycles, trace-gas 
production and ocean–atmosphere flux, and 
models; 
• Determine similarities and differences in 
biogeochemcal and ecosystem responses to 
iron addition between the eastern and 
western subarctic Pacific; 
• Identify specific scientific questions for the 
longer-term experiment in the western 
subarctic Pacific (SEEDS-2004). 
 
The results of the workshop will be published as a 
special issue of Deep-Sea Research II. 
 
IFEP requests support for three invited speakers 
(two from New Zealand and one from Mexico) to 
attend the IFEP Workshop in December 2003 in 
Sidney, Canada. 
 
It was suggested that IFEP needs to work more 
closely with MODEL Task Team for the 
improvement of NEMURO model by adding iron 
limitation to phytoplankton production using the 
data from two successful iron enrichment 
experiments performed in the eastern and 
western subarctic Pacific.  Such a model would 
be useful to see the long-term ecosystem 
responses as well as the experimental design of 
SEEDS 2004.

Sidney, British Columbia, Canada.  (The 
schedule was changed from December 2003 to 
February 2004.)  
 
Specific objectives of the workshop are: 
• to synthesize results from two recent in situ 
iron enrichment experiments in the Subarctic 
Pacific (SEEDS-2001 and SERIES-2002); 
• to discuss responses in lower and higher 
trophic levels, carbon cycles, trace-gas 
production and ocean-atmosphere flux, and

The results of this IFEP workshop will be 
published as a PICES Scientific Report in 2004.  
 
Travel support from PICES is requested (and 
approved in 2003) for one scientist from New 
Zealand to attend the workshop. 
 
Topic Session at ASLO/TOS Conference 
A 1.5-day special session on “Response of the 
upper ocean to mesoscale iron enrichment” will 
be convened February 17–18, 2004, at the 
ASLO/TOS Ocean Research Conference in 
Honolulu, U.S.A.  The Session represents a 
combined effort of the Canadian SOLAS and the 
PICES IFEP.  
 
SEEDS-2004 
The second in situ iron enrichment experiment in 
the Western Subarctic Pacific (SEEDS-2004) 
will take place in July–August 2004.  A Japanese 
ship will release iron on July 17, 2004, stay at the 
iron-enriched patch for 10 days, and come back 
to the site from Day 23 to Day 34.  A US research 
vessel will be at the site from Day 6 to Day 26, 
which allows us 4–5 days’ overlapping at the 
beginning and the end of the experiment. 
 
Publications 
Selected papers from the SEEDS-2002 
experiment as well as the experimental design of 
SEEDS-2004 will be published as a special issue

2004 Report of the Advisory Panel on Iron Fertilization Experiment in the Subarctic 
Pacific Ocean 
(PICES Thirteenth Annual Meeting, October 14–24, 2004, Honolulu, U.S.A.) 
 
 
The meeting of the Advisory Panel on Iron 
fertilization experiment in the subarctic Pacific 
Ocean (IFEP-AP) was held from 17:00–19:30 
hours on October 19 and 19:00–21:00 hours on 
October 20, 2004.  The Panel Co-Chairman, Dr. 
Shigenobu Takeda, called the meeting to order 
and welcomed the participants (IFEP-AP 
Endnote 1).  A new member, Dr. Hiroaki Saito, 
was introduced to the Advisory Panel.  The draft 
agenda for the meeting was reviewed and 
adopted (IFEP-AP Endnote 2). 
 
Activities in 2004 (Agenda Items 3 and 4) 
 
In order to review the results and outstanding 
questions from iron enrichment experiments, and 
to discuss plans for the second longer-term 
experiment in the western subarctic Pacific 
(SEEDS-II), the PICES-IFEP workshop on 
“In-situ iron enrichment experiments in the 
eastern and western subarctic Pacific” was held 
February 11–13, 2004, in Victoria, Canada 
(workshop convenors:  S. Takeda and C.S. Wong).  
26 scientists from Canada, Japan and the United 
States of America, and the PICES Secretariat 
attended the meeting.  The workshop started with 
4 synthesis talks on SEEDS-I, SERIES and 
SOFeX, followed by 14 shorter presentations on 
the physical behavior of the Fe-enriched patch, 
biological/physiological responses, food-web 
dynamics, chemistry of iron, carbon cycle, and 
model prediction.  The results of the workshop 
have been reported in PICES Press (July 2004, 
V ol. 12, No. 2), and will be published as a PICES 
Scientific Report in 2004 or early 2005. 
 
A joint Canadian SOLAS/PICES-IFEP session 
on “Response of the upper ocean to meso-scale 
iron enrichment” was convened on February 
17–18, during the ASLO/TOS 2004 Ocean 
Research Conference held in Honolulu, Hawaii 
(session organizers:  M. Levasseur, A. Tsuda, W. 
Miller, W. Cochlan and R. Rivkin).  The call for 
papers was very well received, resulting in a 
session composed of 23 oral presentations and 17 
posters.  As expected, the session was a showcase 
for the most recent experiment:  SERIES.  But 
there was also significant contribution from 
SEEDS and SOFeX, and some presentations 
proposed thoughtful inter-comparisons between 
the various meso-scale experiments.  This special 
session allowed the recognition of the similarities 
and differences in the responses obtained from 
various in situ experiments.  The results of the 
session have been reported in PICES Press (July 
2004, V ol. 12, No. 2). 
 
Progress report of the SEEDS-I data synthesis 
and publication (Agenda Item 5) 
 
In the summer of 2001, a joint Japan/Canada iron 
enrichment experiment (Subarctic Pacific Iron 
Experiment for Ecosystem Dynamic Study – 
SEEDS-I) was performed in the western 
subarctic Pacific.  A synthesis paper on the 
experiment was published in Science (Tsuda et al. 
“A meso-scale iron enrichment in the western 
subarctic Pacific induced a large centric diatom 
bloom”, Vol. 300:  958–961, 2003).  Twelve 
manuscripts were submitted to a special issue of 
Progress in Oceanography, and 8 papers have 
been accepted to date.  The volume will be 
published in 2005. 
 
Progress report of the SERIES data synthesis 
and publication (Agenda Item 6) 
 
In the summer of 2002, a joint Canada/Japan iron 
enrichment experiment (Subarctic Ecosystem 
Response to Iron Enrichment Study – SERIES) 
was carried out in the eastern subarctic Pacific.  A 
synthesis paper on the experiment was published 
in Nature (Boyd et al. “Evolution, decline and 
fate of an iron-induced subarctic phytoplankton 
bloom”, Vol. 428:  549–553, 2004).  In early 
April of 2004, a 3-day writing workshop was held 
at the Institute of Ocean Sciences, Sidney, 
Canada, to encourage data discussion, synthesis, 
paper outlines and writing.  The workshop was 
successful and worthwhile.  To date, 8 papers 
have been submitted to a special issue of 
Deep-Sea Research II (Guest Editors:  P.J. 
Harrison, M. Levasseur, P. Boyd, R. Rivkin, A. 
Tsuda, and W. Miller), and about 8–10 papers are 
172 
coming in October 2004.  There are still 17 
proposed papers to be submitted, so a second 
volume would be proposed for 2005. 
 
Preliminary report of SEEDS-II in 2004 
(Agenda Item 7) 
 
The second in situ iron enrichment experiment 
(joint Japan/US effort) was conducted in the 
western subarctic gyre of the North Pacific 
(48°10'N, 166°E) from July 20 to August 20, 
2004.  The experiment consisted of two iron 
additions:  (1) 1600 kg of FeSO
4
  × 7H
2
O with an 
inert tracer gas SF
6
, over an 8 × 8 km patch with a 
mixed layer depth of 30 m on Day 0 and  
(2) 790 kg of FeSO
4
 × 7H
2
O on Day 6.  After the 
iron release, significant increase in dissolved iron 
concentration (1.4 nM on Day 1 and 0.6 nM on 
Day 7) was observed.  Chlorophyll a 
concentration in the surface mixed layer 
increased from day 4 and reached >2.5 mg m
–3
 on 
Day 8, but these responses were relatively small 
compared with large increases observed during 
previous SEEDS-I experiment (about 20 mg m
–3
).  
Size structure of phytoplankton was also different 
from SEEDS-I, and <10 µm size fraction 
accounted for 70–80% of the Chlorophyll a 
biomass throughout the observation period.  
Diatoms did not dominate in the phytoplankton 
community and decreases in nitrate and silicate 
concentrations in the surface water were 
minimum.  The observed differences between 
SEEDS-I and SEEDS-II suggest a need to 
develop new hypotheses to explain how plankton 
assemblage responds to iron supply in 
high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll waters in the 
subarctic North Pacific. 
 
Expansion of the terms of references (Agenda 
Item 8) 
 
Due to the unexpected outcomes of the three 
meso-scale iron enrichment experiments, the 
Advisory Panel felt that it is important to expand 
the existing terms of reference (IFEP-AP 
Endnote 3) to include the following item: 
   To synthesize, compare and contrast the 
results of SEEDS-I & II and SERIES, and to 
develop new experimental strategies and 
hypotheses to explain the different 
biogeochemical responses to iron 
enrichment. 
IFEP-AP Workplan for 2005 (Agenda Item 9) 
 
The following plans were outlined: 
 
PICES XIV 
   Conduct a ½-day IFEP/MODEL workshop 
on “Modeling and iron biogeochemistry: 
How far apart are we?” to enhance 
communication between experimentalists 
and modelers, and to establish a framework 
for organizing a 2–3 day workshop that will 
address problems on structuring iron 
biochemical models (IFEP Endnote 4). 
 
Inter-sessional meeting 
   Co-sponsor jointly with the Ocean Research 
Institute (University of Tokyo), a 2-day 
international symposium on SEEDS-II 
experiment, to be held in October 2005, in 
Tokyo, Japan.  The goals of this symposium 
are:  (1) to synthesize results from the second 
in situ iron enrichment experiments in the 
western subarctic North Pacific (SEEDS-II);  
and (2) to discuss differences in magnitude, 
biology and export between SEEDS-I and 
SEEDS-II. 
 
Publications 
   Selected papers from the SERIES iron 
enrichment experiment to be published as a 
special Deep-Sea Research II issue in 2005. 
   A 5-year synthesis report of the Advisory 
Panel to be prepared for publication in the 
PICES Scientific Report Series.  It will 
include circumstances of IFEP, summary of 
SEEDS-I & II and SERIES, terms of 
reference (initial and new), and future plans 
to understand why the three iron enrichment 
experiments in the subarctic North Pacific 
are different in magnitude, biology and 
export. 
The Advisory Panel recognized the importance 
and need for holding a special symposium or 
session on three successful meso-scale iron 
enrichment experiments in the subarctic North 
Pacific (SEEDS-I & II and SERIES).  It is, 
however, not the right time yet to convene such a 
symposium/session because the sample analyses 
and data synthesis of SEEDS-II are still 
underway.  The Advisory Panel decided to 
postpone the special symposium/session to 2006 
or later.

IFEP-AP Endnote 4 
Proposal for a ½-day IFEP/MODEL workshop at PICES XIV on 
“Modeling and iron biogeochemistry:  How far apart are we?” 
Synthesis of data from three successful 
meso-scale iron enrichment experiments in the 
subarctic North Pacific (SEEDS-I, SEEDS-II and 
SERIES) is underway.  This workshop will 
enhance communication between 
experimentalists and modelers.  For the most part, 
iron is not explicitly represented in current 
ecological models.  The goal of this workshop 
will be to examine the structure of iron 
biochemical models with respect to what is 
known about iron biogeochemistry.  The purpose 
will be to establish a framework for organizing a 
2–3 day workshop that will address this problem 
in detail and compare ecological models that 
describe how plankton ecosystem respond to 
meso-scale iron enrichment in the high-nutrient, 
low-chlorophyll waters of the subarctic Pacific. 
Recommended convenors:  Fei Chai (U.S.A) and 
Shigenobu Takeda (Japan).  MODEL has been 
approached to co-sponsor the workshop. 
 
Travel support is requested for two scientists to 
attend the workshop, one expert on iron 
biogeochemistry and another on ecological 
modeling.

Participants of SEEDS cruise after the experiment, forming a 
Chinese character for “iron” by men on the FRV Kaiyo Maru, 
August 2001. 
 
Iron limitation has been proposed as the reason for the existence 
of surface waters rich in macro-nutrients but low in 
phytoplankton biomass in the subarctic Pacific, the equatorial 
Pacific and the Southern Ocean.  Recent in situ iron enrichment 
experiments confirmed this in the equatorial Pacific and the 
Southern Ocean.  In the subarctic Pacific, with biology and 
water structure different from the other two regions, strong 
zonal gradients in atmospheric iron deposition existing between 
the eastern and western gyres may give rise to distinct 
phytoplankton communities that characterize these 
biogeochemical provinces.  Here we present an overview of 
SEEDS (Subarctic Pacific Iron Experiment for Ecosystem 
Dynamics Study), the first in situ test of the iron limitation 
hypothesis on natural ecosystem and geochemical cycles in the 
subarctic Pacific, which was funded by the Ministry of 
Environment of Japan for 3 years.  SEEDS 2001 was originally 
proposed by the Advisory Panel on An Iron Fertilization 
Experiment in the Subarctic Pacific Ocean (IFEP) at the PICES 
Eighth Annual Meeting in Vladivostok, Russia, but the funding 
and ship opportunity were fixed only in March 2001.  Then, we 
started and rushed for preparations of the experiment. 
 
FRV Kaiyo Maru of Fisheries Agency of Japan departed from 
Tokyo on June 28, with full loading of experimental equipment 
and materials (17 large trucks: new record of Kaiyo Maru!).  
Seventeen researchers from the Fisheries Research 
Agency, the Central Research Institute of Electric Power 
Industry, the National Institute for Environmental 
Studies, Hokkaido University, Nagoya University, 
University of Kyoto and University of Tokyo 
participated in the cruise.  The first leg of the cruise was 
allotted for physical and biochemical survey of the target 
area, and performance tests of newly designed 
equipment such as the continuous measurement system 
of an inert tracer gas sulphur hexafluoride (SF
6
), and the 
iron/SF
6
 mixing and injection system.   
 
During the second leg of the cruise, a meso-scale in situ 
iron enrichment experiment was conducted in the 
western subarctic gyre of the North Pacific (48.5ºN, 
165ºE) from July 18 to August 1, 2001 (Fig. 1).  The 
experiment consisted of a single addition of 350 kg iron 
as FeSO
4
 (10,800 L of 0.5 M Fe) with 4100 L of SF
6
 
saturated seawater, over an 8×10 km patch with a mixed 
layer depth of 10 to 15 m.  Using the GPS 
buoy-Lagrangian navigation system, the solution of iron 
and SF
6
 mixed at a constant ratio was released under the 
ship's propellers within 24 hours.  Initial concentration of 
dissolved iron in the iron-enriched patch was about 1.9 
nM (mean value of day-1 underway transect; maximum 
recorded was 6.0 nM).

The weather was foggy but calm throughout the 
observation period, which was lucky for the 
participants in the cruise but less than ideal for satellite 
observation of the iron patch.  The iron-enriched patch 
moved westward during the experiment, but we could 
successfully trace the iron-enriched patch for a 2-week 
observation period by measuring SF
6
 in surface waters.  
Along with continuous surface measurements of SF
6
 
and iron concentrations, a fast repetitive-rate (FRR) 
fluorometer, which measures community 
photosynthetic competency (Fv/Fm), and an 
underway pCO
2
 system, also provided real-time 
mapping.  The first indication of a phytoplankton 
response to iron enrichment was a significant increase 
in Fv/Fm measured by the FRR fluorometer on the 
night of day-3, and the scientists on board get excited.  
By day 10, we observed unambiguous and massive 
biogeochemical responses to the iron addition, which 
resulted in an increase in chlorophyll a concentrations 
to as high as 20 µg/l, and large drawdowns in pCO
2
 
dioxide and nutrients (Fig. 2). 
 
The iron-enriched water became a rich-soup of 
phytoplankton, and a change in the water color was 
recognizable for everyone after day-9 (Fig. 3).  In 
addition, iron supply led to floristic shifts that resulted 
in the dominance of chain-forming large centric 
diatoms, unlike the equatorial Pacific and the Southern 
Ocean where iron stimulated the growth of pennate 
diatoms.  We finished our observation with trawl 
sampling of salmons and other nekton in and out of the 
patch on day-14.  The water mass with high 
chlorophyll and low pCO
2
 was still there, but we had 
to leave. 
 
Our initial findings clearly demonstrate that iron 
availability fundamentally controls the magnitude of 
phytoplankton response in high nutrient areas of the 
western subarctic Pacific.  Analysis of samples from 
this experiment will also help to clarify the role which 
iron plays in regulating the biogeochemical processes 
such as export production.  Furthermore, we realize 
that we need longer and more intense observation of 
the iron-enriched patch to understand the 
ecosystem-scale response to iron input, and the fate of 
accumulated organic carbon after the end of diatom 
blooming, which might only be possible with 
international cooperation.

There are large areas of the North Pacific Ocean where 
iron limits primary productivity.  At Ocean Station 
Papa (OSP; 50
o
N and 145
o
W) (Fig. 1), several iron 
enrichment experiments in carboys on board ship have 
demonstrated that in May/June and August/September, 
when 2-4 nM Fe is added to surface water, chlorophyll 
increases several fold and mainly pennate diatoms 
dominate the phytoplankton assemblage (Boyd et al. 
1996.  In vitro iron enrichment experiments in the NE 
subarctic Pacific.  Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 136: 179-193).  
These pennate diatoms do not appear to be eaten by 
the ambient mesozooplankton and likely sink when 
they have used up the added iron (Harrison et al.  1999.  
Comparison of factors controlling phytoplankton 
productivity in the NE and NW subarctic Pacific gyres.  
Prog. Oceanogr. 43: 205-234).  However, it is not 
possible to measure the broader ecosystem response 
and carbon flux in carboy experiments.  As the next 
step in the study of the ecosystem response to an iron 
addition at OSP , we proposed a large-scale open ocean 
iron enrichment, similar to IRONEX I and II, SOIREE 
and, more recently, the successful Japanese SEEDS 
experiment (this issue).  These plans were initiated by 
the Advisory Panel on An Iron Fertilization 
Experiment in the Subarctic Pacific Ocean (IFEP) at 
the PICES Eighth Annual Meeting in Vladivostok, 
Russia, in October 1999 (for details see PICES 1999 
Annual Report, pp. 108-110).  Plans were further 
developed at the special IFEP Planning Workshop on 
“Designing the iron fertilization experiment in the 
Subarctic Pacific” that was held in October 2000, in 
Tsukuba, Japan, in association with the PICES Ninth 
Annual Meeting (for details see PICES 2000 Annual 
Report, pp. 89-95). 
 
This year we received funding from the Natural 
Sciences and Engineering Research Council of 
Canada (NSERC) and Panel for Energy Research and 
Development (PERD) of Natural Resources Canada 
(NRCan) to Fisheries and Oceans Canada.  This 
funding is part of the Canadian SOLAS (Surface 
Ocean Lower Atmosphere) program and it will form a 
contribution to the International SOLAS project, a 
new core project under the International Geosphere 
Biosphere Program.  The main objective of the 
International and Canadian SOLAS program is to 
address the key interactions among the marine 
 
biogeochemical system, the atmosphere, and climate.  One of the 
highlights of the Canadian SOLAS program is that it will bring 
the atmospheric scientists and the oceanographers together for 
the first time in this coordinated project.  At OSP, we will test 
how an addition of iron (as a simulation of natural Fe additions 
via dust or offshore eddies) will increase primary productivity, 
the production of trace gases such as dimethylsulphide (DMS) 
and organic halides and the drawdown of CO
2
, all of which can 
influence climate.  We have adopted the acronym SERIES 
(Subarctic Ecosystem Response to Iron Enrichment Study) for 
our iron enrichment experiment.

In July 2002, we will collaborate with scientists from Japan and 
the United States to conduct an open ocean iron enrichment 
experiment at OSP.  There will be two ships, Canadian CCS John 
P. Tully and Mexican R/V El Puma (Figs. 2 and 3), that will 
provide about 40 berths.  We plan to enrich a 100-km
2
 patch of 
the ocean and follow it for 2 to 3 weeks.  Japanese scientists will 
visit OSP and extend the sampling time along with the US 
scientists (if they receive funding).  This extension in following 
the patch should allow us to determine the fate of the bloom.

We will measure a wide range of parameters to determine 
the response of the plankton community to the iron addition, 
the fate of carbon (drawdown of CO
2
 and carbon export), 
production of trace gases (DMS, N
2
O and organic halides), 
iron chemistry (including iron complexation and the 
longevity of the bloom), and exchange processes at the 
air/sea interface.  The field data will ultimately be 
integrated into coupled ocean and atmosphere models.

Our results will provide a very interesting comparison 
between the response of the NE (Canadian SOLAS) and 
NW (SEEDS Japan) subarctic Pacific gyres to iron 
enrichment.  The NW gyre is less iron-limited since it is 
closer to an iron source, the dust from the Gobi Desert in 
China.  The two gyres present a natural gradient of iron 
limitation and hence a different ecosystem response is 
expected to the iron enrichment.

Iron deficiency has been proposed as the reason for the 
existence of surface waters rich in macro-nutrients but low 
in phytoplankton biomass in the subarctic Pacific, the 
equatorial Pacific and the Southern Ocean.  In summer of 
2001, an iron enrichment experiment (Subarctic Pacific Iron 
Experiment for Ecosystem Dynamics Study – SEEDS-I) 
was performed in the western subarctic Pacific;  and in 
summer of 2002, another iron enrichment experiment 
(Subarctic Ecosystem Response to Iron Enrichment Study - 
SERIES) was carried out in the eastern subarctic Pacific.  
These international collaborative projects between Canada 
and Japan were conceived at the first planning workshop of 
the PICES Advisory Panel on Iron Fertilization Experiment 
(IFEP), held in Tsukuba, Japan, in 2000, in conjunction with 
PICES IX. 
 
In order to review the results and outstanding questions from 
these experiments and to discuss plans for the second 
longer-term experiment in the western subarctic Pacific 
(SEEDS-II), the PICES-IFEP Workshop on “In situ iron 
enrichment experiments in the eastern and western subarctic 
Pacific” was held February 11-13, 2004, at the Chateau 
Victoria Hotel, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.  26 
scientists from Canada, Japan, and the United States of 
America attended the workshop (Fig. 1). 
 
The objectives of the workshop were to: 
   Synthesize results from the two in situ iron enrichment 
experiments performed in the eastern and western 
subarctic Pacific (SEEDS-I and SERIES); 
   Discuss responses to iron additions in lower and higher 
trophic levels, carbon cycles, trace-gas production and 
ocean-atmosphere flux, and models; 
   Determine similarities and differences in 
biogeo-chemical and ecosystem responses to iron 
addition between the eastern and western subarctic 
Pacific; 
   Identify specific scientific questions for the new 
longer-term experiment in the western subarctic Pacific 
(SEEDS-II). 
 
The workshop started with 4 synthesis talks on SEEDS-I, 
SERIES and SOFeX, followed by 14 shorter presentations
182 
 
 
Fig. 1 Workshop participants at the entrance of the Chateau Victoria Hotel 
 
 
on the physical behavior of the Fe-enriched patch, 
biological/physiological responses, food-web dynamics, 
chemistry of iron, carbon cycle, and model prediction. 
 
What have we learned from the enrichment experiments? 
 
Both SEEDS-I and SERIES have demonstrated increased 
productivity and biomass of phytoplankton as a response to 
the iron enrichment.  Bloom evolution and decline was 
captured in detail during SERIES.  However, there are 
differences in the physical and chemical environments, the 
plankton ecosystem and dominant species, and zonal iron 
gradient between the Western Subarctic Gyre (WSG) and 
the Alaskan Gyre (AG).  From SEEDS-I and SERIES, we 
can point out the following similarities and differences in 
biogeochemical and ecosystem responses to iron addition: 
 
Similarities 
   Diatom bloom occurred;  floristic shift to large cells; 
   Vertically-integrated Chl-a and primary production 
increased; 
   Heterotrophic dinoflagellates grazed on diatoms after 
the development of the bloom, and led to significant 
loss of diatoms in the mixed layer; 
   Copepods were not the primary grazers;  SERIES was 
not well matched with the spring period of maximum 
diatom grazing (Neocalanus plumchrus); 
   DOC (dissolved organic carbon) increased during the 
growth phase of bloom, was constant through the 
stationary phase, and decreased during the bloom 
decline;  DOC production was about 10% of primary 
production; 
   Increased dissolved-Fe was mainly in colloidal fraction; 
   Dissolved-Fe concentration decreased rapidly by 
colloidal aggregation and biological uptake (less), and 
loss rate gradually decreased; 
   Particulate-Fe concentrations remained high;  
bioavailability of remaining iron (mainly particulate) 
was low; 
   Majority of macro-nutrients were consumed; 
   Increase in Si/NO
3
 drawdown ratio was observed after 
occurrence of physiological stress such as iron and light 
limitations. 
 
Differences 
   A larger and faster response (in terms of biomass) was 
observed in WSG; 
   Initial diatom populations largely neritic for WSG and 
pelagic for AG;  neritic species responded quickly to the 
iron enrichment and built up a large biomass, 
suggesting that the presence of coastal species as resting 
spores or cells is important in determining the 
magnitude of bloom evolution; 
   The bloom was characterized by two ecological phases 
in SERIES.  Phase I consisted of nano-phytoplankton 
(prymnesiophytes) and occurred before day 10 of the 
experiment, and phase II was mainly diatoms and began 
after day 10; 
   Sediment traps collected large CaCO
3
 fluxes after phase 
I, and high biogenic-Si and POC fluxes after phase II 
during SERIES, but not in SEEDS-I.  SEEDS-I 
occupation may have been too short to observe export 
event; 
 
183 
   >50% of the mixed-layer POC (particulate organic 
carbon) deficit attributed to bacterial re-mineralization 
and meso-zooplankton grazing in AG;  NH
4
 in surface 
waters increased throughout the bloom; 
   Characteristics of organic ligands changed rapidly upon 
Fe enrichment in WSG;  ligands concentration tracked 
dissolved-Fe concentration in AG, rapidly disappearing 
together with dissolved-Fe concentration; 
   The iron enrichment created a bloom of DMSP-rich 
nano-phytoplankton (E. huxleyi) which crashed after 
day 11 in SERIES, but no significant increase in 
DMS/DMSP was observed in WSG; 
   The Fe-induced increase in DMSP had no clear effect 
on DMS concentrations in AG; 
   The iron-induced deficit in DMS concentrations during 
the peak of the diatom bloom resulted from a decrease 
in biological DMS net production in AG. 
 
Kenneth Coale was invited to give a synthesis talk on 
Southern Ocean Iron Experiment (SOFeX), which was 
performed in 2002, to investigate the effects of iron 
enrichment in regions with high and low concentrations of 
silicic acid.  He identified the following questions to be 
resolved in future experiments. 
   What are Fe:C:Si:N:P uptake and re-generation 
stoichiometries?  How are these stoichiometries related 
to phytoplankton community structure? 
   What is the steady-state condition?  Is this a relevant 
question? 
   What is the periodicity and magnitude of natural iron 
enrichment, both seasonally and inter-annually, and on 
glacial-interglacial time scales? 
   What is the effect of iron enrichment on the 
geochemistry (low O
2
 and de-nitrification) and ecology 
(nitrification) below and within the Fe patch? 
   Do ecosystems respond in a natural manner to artificial 
Fe enrichments?  What are the similarities and 
differences between natural and artificial Fe supply? 
 
What are outstanding questions? 
 
SEEDS-II is the second meso-scale iron enrichment 
experiment in WSG designed to investigate the longer-term 
effects of iron enrichment on plankton ecosystem, carbon 
export and trace gas production.  SEEDS-II will involve 
about 50 researchers from universities and government 
institutions in Japan, the United States and Canada.  The 
iron-enriched patch will be monitored by two ships, the R/V 
Hakuho Maru (Japan) and the R/V Kilo Moana (U.S.A.), for 
34 days from July 21 to August 23, 2004.  Through the 
integration and synthesis of the findings from SEEDS-I, 
SERIES and SOFeX, the workshop participants identified 
the following key themes and key scientific questions for the 
SEEDS-II experiment. 
 
Fate of carbon 
   What portions of organic carbon fixed by coastal centric 
diatoms in WSG will be exported from the surface 
mixed layer, and what portions will be regenerated? 
   To what extent would heterotrophic dinoflagellates 
(Gyrodinium) respire Fe-induced carbon fixation? 
   What is turnover time of produced DOC? 
   What are community respiration rates? 
   Is C:N:P:Si regeneration ratios in surface and 
subsurface layers crucial to our understanding of 
Fe-induced ecological response and nutrient dynamics? 
   Is biological patchiness in species and export within the 
patch significant? 
   How does physical dilution from outside affect the 
patch chemistry and biology?  What is the effect of 
dilution on budget calculations? 
 
Ecosystem responses 
   Why did SEEDS-I and SERIES have opposite trends in 
dominant diatom composition? 
   What is the role of cell lysis on changes in available 
nutrients, sources of DMSP, bacterial community 
structure and iron chemistry? 
   What roles will sinking and grazing play in the decline 
of the bloom? 
   What is the long-term effect of Fe availability on the 
ecosystem?  How is the response to further iron addition 
affected? 
   The ecological response to iron enrichment is largely 
determined by the seed population.  What will the 
species variability and ecosystem differences be 
between iron-induced blooms in the same location? 
   How predictable will the species response be to iron 
addition? 
   Why does Fe addition to bottles result in N-limitation, 
but the large-scale Fe additions show Si-depletion? 
 
Seasonal timing 
   If natural events occur, should we try to emulate those 
that occur at other times of the year? 
   What is the importance of the presence of endemic 
zooplankton at the time of iron enrichment? 
 
Fe biogeochemistry 
   What controls iron retention and loss after iron release? 
   What is the main source of ligands production?  How 
does it respond to iron enrichment? 
   What is the role of iron ligands in Fe bioavailability and 
recycling? 
   What is the role of Fe(II) in the phytoplankton bloom? 
   What is the uptake of iron by different biota? 
   What is the difference between single and multiple iron 
additions, and their effect on availability of iron? 
   Comparison with natural iron supply:  labile particulate 
iron was significantly higher in the surface mixed layer 
in WSG, but dissolved iron was at the same level as in 
the eastern region. 
   Is bioavailability of iron (not total iron input) most 
important for ecosystem response? 
 
Trace-gas production 
   What is the fate of DMSP?  Is it consumed by bacteria?  
Does it sink? 
   What are the roles of physiological stress, Fe 
availability, light and macronutrients on DMSP 
cycling?   
   What is the extent of emission to atmosphere? 
184 
Recommendations for SEEDS-II 
 
   It was recommended to lengthen the experiment if 
possible;  the decline will depend on patch physical 
dynamics, bloom dynamics, etc. 
   Additional suite of measurements is required to study 
bloom evolution, including FRRF, Flavodoxin, sinking 
rates, TEPS, and supplement these with 
15
N and 
32
Si 
uptake rates; 
   Additional methods are required to determine the role 
of the microbial community and zooplankton in the fate 
of POC and O
2
 profiles of the upper ocean, community 
respiration, labelled particle decomposition 
experiments; 
   Additional experiments are required for measuring 
export flux, such as trap calibration with thorium, 
large-volume pump thorium samples, more 
fluorometers for the upper trap moorings; 
   Estimates of silica dissolution, bacterial production and 
respiration, and bacterial Fe-stress should occur; 
   Measurements of micro- and meso-zooplankton grazing, 
and the prey (including particles are desirable. 
 
Thanks to the excellent presentations and spirited discussion 
from all participants, the workshop was very successful.  
The results of the workshop will be published as a PICES 
Scientific Report in 2004.

the C-SOLAS program, she participated in the SERIES iron 
enrichment experiment in the NE Pacific to determine the 
influence of iron on the distribution and biological cycling 
of DMSP and DMS.  
 
 
Background 
 
The productivity of large portions of the global ocean is 
thought to be limited by the availability of iron, a 
micronutrient essential to phytoplankton growth.  So far, 
eight meso-scale iron fertilization experiments have been 
conducted in order to test this hypothesis, and to provide 
insights on the potential effect of iron addition on algal 
blooms development and the biogeochemical cycle of major 
elements, with a special focus on climatically-active gases, 
such as CO
2
 and dimethylsulfide (DMS).  Two of these 
recent experiments conducted in the North Pacific were 
developed under the umbrella of PICES, through its 
Advisory Panel on Iron Fertilisation Experiment, co-chaired 
by Drs. Shigenobu Takeda and C.S. Wong.  These 
experiments took place in 2001 in the Northwest Pacific 
(SEEDS), and in 2002 in the Northeast Pacific (SERIES).  
Both experiments were successful and generated important 
new findings (Tsuda et al.  2003.  A mesoscale iron 
enrichment in the western subarctic Pacific induces large 
centric diatom bloom.  Science, 300: 958-961;  Boyd et al. 
2004.  Evolution, decline and fate of an iron-induced 
subarctic phytoplankton bloom.  Nature, 428: 549-553). 
 
Meso-scale experiments are costly, involve many scientists 
and generate huge volumes of data.  It is our responsibility to 
maximize the diffusion of this information and to ensure a 
skilful utilization of these unique data sets.  A group of 
research scientists involved in the planning and realization 
of these experiments thought that the timing was good to 
synthesize and compare the responses obtained so far during 
these experiments.  To accomplish this task a joint 
C-SOLAS/PICES-IFEP session on “Response of the upper 
ocean to meso-scale iron enrichment” was convened on 
February 17-18, during the ASLO/TOS 2004 Ocean 
Research Conference held in Honolulu, Hawaii (session 
organizers:  Maurice Levasseur, Atsushi Tsuda, William 
Miller, William Cochlan and Richard Rivkin).  
 
The call for papers was very well received, resulting in a 
session composed of 23 oral presentations and 17 posters.  
As expected, the session was a showcase for the most recent 
experiment:  SERIES.  But there was also significant 
contribution from SEEDS and SOFeX, and some 
presentations proposed thoughtful inter-comparisons 
between the various meso-scale experiments.  This special 
session allowed to recognize the similarities and differences 
in the responses obtained from these experiments. 
 
Overview of presentations 
 
The session started with a tutorial by Kenneth Coale who 
presented a synthesis of the knowledge gained from the 
seven mesoscale iron enrichments experiments conducted so 
far, pointing at similarities but also emphasizing that each 
experiment was unique in terms of location, season and 
initial conditions, and thus generated different responses to 
iron enrichment.  The take home message was that although 
we know much more than 10 years ago, much remains to be 
understood in order to properly evaluate the global impact of 
iron on ocean biogeochemical cycles and climate. 
186 
The tutorial was followed by 4 talks on SOFeX, highlighting 
new outcomes from this expedition in the Southern Ocean.  
William Cochlan showed that there was a clear change in the 
relative utilization of new and re-generated nitrogen 
following the iron fertilization, with nitrate uptake 
increasing by 15-fold and 25-fold north and south of the 
Antarctic Polar Front Zone (APFZ), respectively.  Stephen 
Baines reported on iron-induced changes in the elemental 
stoichiometries of individual diatoms and flagellates using a 
synchrotron x-ray fluorescence microprobe.  His results 
indicate biochemical changes in the resident plankton, 
suggesting differences in the biogeochemistry of Fe-replete 
and Fe-deplete regions of the ocean.  Mark Brzezinski 
showed that iron fertilization caused a shift from 
non-Redfield to Redfield nutrient uptake ratios in the 
Southern Ocean, shifts that will have strong implications for 
elemental cycling and climate during periods of enhanced 
Fe supply.  Finally, Michael Hiscock demonstrated that iron 
addition resulted in an increase in the maximum quantum 
yield of photosynthesis, but that the intensity of the response 
varied within size fractions between the nitrate-rich and 
silicate-rich in the waters north and south of the APFZ.  
These presentations, along with the companion posters, 
highlighted important regional variability in the responses of 
the plankton community to iron fertilization in the Southern 
Ocean. 
 
The next 2 talks, accompanied by 4 posters, reported more 
specifically on the SEEDS expedition conducted in the NW 
Pacific in 2001.  Atsushi Tsuda gave an overview of SEEDS 
where the iron fertilization induced a large centric diatom 
bloom resulting in a marked consumption of macronutrients, 
a huge increase (factor ~ 20) in chlorophyll a concentrations 
and a marked drawdown in pCO
2
.  By day 13 of the 
experiment, the export of fixed carbon represented only 13% 
of the primary production in the iron-enriched patch, with 
most of POC (particular organic carbon) remaining in the 
surface mixed layer.  The fate of the bloom remains 
unknown.  Isao Kudo presented interesting results on the 
effect of water temperature on the response of the 
phytoplankton community to iron addition obtained in 
shipboard experiments performed during SEEDS and 
SERIES.  The phytoplankton growth rate in the fraction of 
>10 μm was higher in the NW Pacific than in the NE Pacific 
for similar iron addition and temperature (12°C).  Since 
surface temperature increased from 5 to 9°C in the weeks 
before the SEEDS experiment, he hypothesized that the 
growth rate dependence on temperature could explain the 
exceptionally large increase in chlorophyll a and primary 
production measured during SEEDS.  Jun Nishioka 
presented a poster on the distribution of size-fractionated 
iron and showed that iron supply is higher in the NW Pacific 
than in the NE Pacific due to more frequent atmospheric 
inputs.  During SEEDS, the added dissolved iron was 
rapidly transformed to labile particulate iron, reducing its 
bio-availability to phytoplankton, a process that probably 
also occurs for dissolved iron originating from atmospheric 
inputs.  In his poster, Takeshi Yoshimura demonstrated that 
in the NW Pacific, 10 to 20% of the net organic carbon 
production was converted to DOC (dissolved organic 
carbon) during the growth and stationary phases of the 
bloom.  In the NE Pacific, the net DOC production was 
higher during the decline phase of the bloom, suggesting the 
domination of decomposition processes.  Hiroaki Saito’s 
poster suggested that phytoplankton growth exceeded 
micro-zooplankton grazing at the beginning of the SEEDS 
experiment, but micro-zooplankton grazing rates and 
phytoplankton grazing mortality increased rapidly at the end 
of the experiment.  These results highlighted the balance 
between phytoplankton growth and loss due to grazing, and 
how this equilibrium may be affected by iron.  Naoki Yoshie 
presented a poster on the modeling of the SEEDS diatom 
bloom.  The model successfully reproduced the vertical 
distributions of macronutrients and chlorophyll during the 
evolution of the bloom.  The model predicts that the effect of 
iron on the ecosystem would last for 40 days, and that the 
export flux during the 13-day observation period represents 
20 to 30% of the export predicted for 40 days.  
 
The following 15 oral presentations (with 5 posters) 
reported on SERIES, the most recent meso-scale iron 
enrichment experiment at that time.  This block of talks 
began with an overview of SERIES by Phillip Boyd, who 
presented the evolution, decline and fate of the SERIES 
bloom.  His talk was completed by the presentation of David 
Timothy on the nutrient dynamics, uptake and export of 
carbon and biogenic silica.  Their results showed that the 
termination of the diatom bloom was due to iron limitation 
followed by silicic acid limitation.  More than half of the 
carbon fixed by the bloom was grazed or re-mineralized by 
bacteria and only a small portion of the bloom’s particulate 
carbon (18%) and biogenic silica (34%) was exported from 
surface waters (>50 m).  Jean-Eric Tremblay presented data 
on phytoplankton growth and nutrient uptake ratios during 
the evolution of the bloom.  The nano-phytoplankton bloom 
was initiated by increased growth rates immediately after 
iron addition, and was halted by grazing losses.  A 
presentation by Nelson Sherry and a poster by Paul Harrison 
described the shift in phytoplankton community 
composition from small nano-phytoplankton (flagellates) to 
large pennate diatoms.  Chlorophyll a and primary 
production increased rapidly during the diatom bloom in 
parallel with a drawdown of macronutrients.  Adrian 
Marchetti presented field and lab data on elemental 
composition ratios in a diatom, showing that iron-limitation 
resulted in an increase of the Si/N ratio due to a decrease in 
N-uptake.  He concluded that diatoms were iron-stressed 
before the full depletion of silicic acid during SERIES. 
 
Richard Rivkin presented an insightful synthesis of the 
influence of iron on bacterial stocks and processes during 
different meso-scale iron enrichments.  Iron increased 
bacterial abundance and production during all fertilization 
experiments.  The bacterial response during SERIES was 
markedly larger than in the Equatorial Pacific (IronEx II) 
and Southern Ocean (SOIREE), resulting in increased 
retention of carbon in the surface layer and reduced export to 
the deep ocean.  Carol Adly and Michelle Hale presented 
posters on the bacterial response to iron enrichment.  The 
first author reported a small but rapid increase in bacterial 
abundance and production immediately (few hours) after 
 
187 
iron enrichment, suggesting that bacteria were initially 
iron-limited.  Hale’s results showed that the bacteria were 
generally DOM-limited during the first days of the 
experiment.  Bacterial production and growth rates peaked 6 
days prior to the increase in biomass, suggesting that 
bacteria were under strong grazing pressure during the first 
13 days of the bloom. 
 
Sonia Michaud and Michel Scarratt presented results on the 
influence of iron on the dimethylsulfoniopropionate 
(DMSP) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) distribution during 
SERIES, and Anissa Merzouk presented data on DMSP and 
DMS biological cycling.  The bacterial utilization of DMSP 
shifted from high DMS production in the sulfur-rich 
nano-phytoplankton bloom to low DMS production during 
the sulfur-poor diatom bloom, resulting in an overall DMS 
deficit in the iron-enriched patch.  It is the first time that a 
negative effect of iron fertilization on DMS is observed.  
William Miller and Rene-Christian Bouillon showed that 
iron fertilization decreased the DMS photo-oxidation rate 
coefficient.  They proposed that nitrate-photolysis played a 
significant role in DMS photo-degradation.  Yvonnick. Le 
Clainche used an inverse modeling approach to show that 
the regional increase in DMS concentrations during SERIES 
resulted from a combination of low ventilation and high 
DMS biological net production. 
 
Robert Moore presented data on the production and fluxes of 
isoprene and methyl-iodide, two atmospherically-reactive 
gases.  The net production of isoprene and its flux to the 
atmosphere increased during the course of the experiment, 
whereas methyl-iodide concentrations were lower in-patch 
than out-patch.  These gases were of biogenic origin but 
their production mechanisms are poorly understood. 
 
Kenneth Denman presented the modeling of the plankton 
community structure during the iron enrichment.  The model 
reproduced well the development of the bloom but not the 
export of carbon fixed by the diatom bloom, suggesting that 
processes such as aggregation may have played a role in 
increasing the export flux at the end of the bloom. 
 
Less usual for an ASLO meeting, the last two talks reported 
on the influence of iron fertilization on the atmospheric 
distribution of DMS, methane sulfonic acid (MSA) and 
aerosols.  Moire Wadleigh presented the sea-to-air DMS 
fluxes and atmospheric DMS concentrations, while Lisa 
Phinney reported on aerosol processing over the region of 
the SERIES experiment.  DMS fluxes were correlated with 
seawater DMS concentrations and wind speeds.  
Atmospheric DMS, MSA and sulfate concentrations were 
high in the study area compared to mean worldwide values.  
DMS and its degradation products were particularly 
elevated during a regional episode of high seawater DMS 
concentrations around days 6-9. 
 
Conclusions 
 
Papers presented during the session revealed important 
similarities and differences in the responses to iron 
fertilization observed in the different high nutrient low 
chlorophyll (HNLC) oceanic regions.  One noteworthy 
similarity is that the growth of phytoplankton from all size 
classes seemed to be stimulated by iron addition, with small 
flagellated cells blooming first, followed by the diatoms.   
 
Although a decrease in pCO
2
 is generally measured in those 
experiments, results from SERIES indicate a low carbon 
sequestration efficiency.  Whether such low efficiency can 
be extrapolated to the other HNLC regions is uncertain since 
bloom termination was generally not monitored during 
previous experiments.  Carbon sequestration may vary 
depending on the structure of the phytoplankton assemblage, 
the limiting nutrient (Fe, nitrate, silicate), grazing, 
respiration, etc.  Since these conditions vary from one site to 
another, the efficiency of carbon sequestration is expected to 
change as well.  There is thus a need to determine the fate of 
the bloom in the major HNLC regions.   
 
In addition to altering the carbon cycle, iron fertilization 
may also affect the production of other climatically-active 
biogenic gases such as DMS.  During SERIES, the 
iron-induced diatom bloom coincided with a decrease in 
DMS concentrations.  This was a clear departure from 
previous experiments where iron addition resulted in an 
increase in DMS.  Again, these conflicting results call for 
further experiments.  In order to properly evaluate the global 
impact of iron on sea-to-air exchange of climatically-active 
gases, we need a minimum, but statistically sound, 
understanding of the sensitivity of the different HNLC 
regions to iron.  This can only be achieved through repeated, 
well planned, experiments.  Given that up to 40% of the 
ocean surface is limited by iron, these experiments are 
essential steps in our quest to understand past, present, and 
future climate.
