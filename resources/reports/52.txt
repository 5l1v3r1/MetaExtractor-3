Executive Summary 
Progress is being made internationally on an ecosystem approach to the management of marine systems, 
in particular as applied to ecosystem-based fisheries management.  This concept has recently been 
expanded to include people in what are now called coupled marine social-ecological systems.  Such 
concepts can provide an integrated understanding of how ecosystem changes affect human social systems, 
and vice versa.  This integrated concept of understanding social-ecological systems in the coastal areas in 
order to achieve a sustainable balance between these two systems is called sato-umi (village seas) in 
Japanese.  In 2012, PICES started an integrated social-ecological systems research project named “Marine 
Ecosystem Health and Human Well-Being (MarWeB)”, which was funded by the Japanese Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.  The key questions of the project were: (a) How do marine ecosystems 
support human well-being? and (b) How do human communities support sustainable and productive 
marine ecosystems?  This report is the summary of the results from the project. 
In this report, various social and natural scientific tools are introduced using real data from case studies to 
exemplify how to conduct social-ecological systems analysis for marine-dependent communities.  Section 2 
provides an overview of novel research at the national level on how the member countries of PICES and 
one of the case study nations (Indonesia) perceive their interactions with the sea.  This section sets the 
general concepts for how people interact with the sea, and identifies important national differences.  It 
uses the concepts of human well-being, and involves peoples’ evaluations of their lives and interactions 
with the sea, such as positive emotions, engagement, satisfaction, and meaning.  Because marine ecosystems 
provide a wide-variety of ecosystem services, some kind of “weighting function” is needed in order to 
allocate the limited human and financial resources to protect/conserve ecosystem services in socially 
appropriate ways.  The challenge here is that each society or country has its specific priorities based on 
their cultural and historical backgrounds.  At the same time, in order to discuss social-ecological systems 
approaches at the scale of the entire North Pacific, understanding the differences and commonalities in 
how well-being is structured among these countries is needed. 
Section 3 presents a summary of the first case study focusing on shrimp aquaculture in Indonesia.  In this 
study, local needs were apparent from the beginning, including the prevention of land erosion by 
abandoned shrimp ponds after the occurrence of shrimp diseases from excessively intensive aquaculture 
operations.  To reduce emissions of high-nutrient effluents into the coastal zone, integrated multi-trophic 
aquaculture (IMTA) technology was introduced to conduct multi-species aquaculture in a sustainable 
manner.  Also, scientific techniques to monitor impacts to the local marine ecosystems were presented.  
Section 4 summarises the results from community needs assessments and attempts to implement oyster 
aquaculture in coastal communities of Guatemala.  Guatemala represents a “bottom up”, and Indonesia a 
“top down”, example of different approaches to implementing sato-umi concepts.  In Section 5, the 
current situation of the nation-wide introduction of marine protected areas in Palau is described. 
  
Executive Summary 
vi  PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
Section 6 presents comparisons among the case studies.  As the final section, Section 7 provides the 
conclusions, lessons learned and recommendations for how to conduct social-ecological systems (sato-
umi type) analyses in developing countries around the North Pacific. 
In response to the two key questions posed at the outset of this project, we offer the following conclusions: 
(a) How do marine ecosystems support human well-being? 
The “traditional” biophysical science approach to this question is often framed in terms of food supply 
and livelihoods.  However, this narrow framing leaves out the very important psychological needs of how 
people relate to the sea.  In reality, both psychological and physical needs are required for positive human 
well-being. 
(b) How do human communities support sustainable and productive marine ecosystems? 
This is the reciprocal question to that above.  It is a more social science-centered view, with the focus on 
people and what they do, or can do, to ensure or improve healthy marine ecosystems.  The actions of 
people can be detrimental or beneficial to marine ecosystems.  These actions become all the more 
important to consider when the biophysical marine ecosystems are already under stress, for example from 
a changing climate.  This concept of what people can do to cultivate healthy marine ecosystems is at the 
core of the Japanese concept of sato-umi.  
One of the strongest lessons learned from these studies was the importance of connecting with organizations 
in each country which could facilitate and advance the project.  In order to conduct social-ecological 
systems research in an effective and efficient way, close connections with these key organizations and 
people are needed to understand the concept of marine social-ecological systems, and to be able to 
translate it into the local context.

Ringkasan 
Kemajuan dalam bidang pengelolaan sumberdaya kelautan dengan pendekatan ekosistem sedang 
berlangsung secara global di dunia internasional, terutama dalam bidang pengelolaan sumberdaya 
perikanan berbasis ekosistem. Konsep ini diperluas dengan melibatkan masyarakat  ke dalam suatu sistem 
terintegrasi yang sekarang dikenal sebagai sistem sosio-ekologi kelautan.   Konsep semacam ini dapat 
memberikan pemahaman secara terpadu tentang bagaimana perubahan ekosistem dapat mempengaruhi 
sistem sosial kehidupan manusia, dan sebaliknya. Konsep terpadu untuk memahami sistem sosio-ekologi 
di kawasan pesisir untuk mencapai keseimbangan yang berkelanjutan antara kedua sistem ini disebut 
sato-umi (desa-laut) dalam bahasa Jepang.  Pada tahun 2012, PICES memulai sebuah proyek penelitian 
sistem sosio-ekologi terpadu yang diberi nama “Marine Ecosystem Health and Human Well-Being 
(MarWeB)” atau Ekosistem Kelautan untuk Kesejahteraan Manusia", yang didanai oleh Kementerian 
Pertanian, Kehutanan dan Perikanan Jepang. Pertanyaan utama dari proyek ini adalah: (a) bagaimana 
ekosistem laut dapat mendukung kesejahteraan manusia? dan (b) bagaimana masyarakat dapat  
mendukung pengelolaan ekosistem laut secara berkelanjutan dan produktif? Laporan ini merupakan 
rangkuman hasil dari proyek MarWeB. 
Dalam laporan ini, berbagai perangkat metoda ilmiah sosio-ekologi diperkenalkan dengan menggunakan 
data riil dari studi kasus untuk memberi contoh bagaimana analisis sistem sosio-ekologi dilakukan untuk 
masyarakat yang hidupnya  bergantung kepada  laut.  Bagian 2 memberikan gambaran umum tentang 
penelitian terbaru di tingkat nasional mengenai bagaimana negara-negara anggota PICES dengan studi 
kasus pada salah satu negara dapat memahami interaksi masyarakat dengan sumberdaya laut. Bagian ini 
menyampaikan konsep umum tentang bagaimana masyarakat berinteraksi dengan sumberdaya laut, dan 
mengidentifikasi beberapa perbedaan yang penting secara nasional.  Hal in dilakukan dengan 
menggunakan indikator konsep kesejahteraan masyarakat, dengan melibatkan masyarakat dalam 
mengevaluasi tentang kehidupan dan interaksi mereka dengan sumberdaya  laut, seperti hal-hal yang 
bersifat positif yang berkaitan dengan keterlibatan mereka dalam suatu kegiatan, kemudian tentang 
kepuasan dan memaknai arti kehidupan.  Mengingat ekosistem laut menyediakan beragam sumberdaya 
untuk kehidupan manusia, berbagai strategi diperlukan agar sumber daya baik manusia maupun keuangan 
yang bersifat terbatas dapat dialokasikan atau dimanfaatkan untuk melestarikan sumberdaya laut melalui 
pendekatan sosio-ekologi. Tantangan yang dihadapi dalam hal ini adalah bagaimana masyarakat atau 
negara dapat memprioritaskan program yang spesifik untuk mengelola sumberdaya laut secara 
berkelanjutan berdasarkan latar belakang budaya dan sejarah yang dimilikinya.  Pada saat yang sama, 
untuk membahas pendekatan sistem sosio-ekologi di wilayah Pasifik Utara, pemahaman akan perbedaan 
dan kesamaan tentang struktur dan ukuran kesejahteraan antara negara sangat diperlukan. 
Bagian 3 menyajikan ringkasan studi kasus pertama tentang budidaya udang dan perikanan terintegrasi di 
Indonesia. Dalam penelitian ini, diketahui bahwa setiap daerah memiliki karakteristik yang berbeda 
dalam pengembangan budidaya perikanan, termasuk bagaimana mengoptimalkan lahan tambak yang 
terbengkalai karena kerusakan lingkungan akibat pengembangan budidaya udang secara intensif dalam 
kurun waktu tahun 1980 an yang menyebabkan timbulnya wabah penyakit pada udang.  Untuk 
Ringkasan 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52  ix 
mengurangi pencemaran lingkungan perairan akibat limbah organik di kawasan pesisir, teknologi 
budidaya perikanan terintegrasi berbasis sistem bioresirkulasi yang dikenal dengan nama Integrated 
Multi-Tropic Aquaculture (IMTA) dengan menggunakan beberapa jenis komoditi budidaya perikanan 
disarankan untuk dikembangkan dan diterapkan di perairan pesisir Indonesia. Selain itu juga 
diperkenalkan metode ilmiah untuk memantau dampak lingkungan terhadap ekosistem laut.  Bagian 4 
merangkum hasil kajian kebutuhan masyarakat dan upaya penerapan budidaya kerang di kawasan pesisir 
Guatemala. Guatemala dan Indonesia menerapkan sistem yang berbeda dalam menerapkan konsep sato-

menyampaikan situasi terkini dari kawasan perlindungan laut di Palau. 
Bagian 6 menyajikan perbandingan antar studi kasus, sebagai bagian akhir dari laporan ini, Bagian 7, 
menyampaikan kesimpulan, pengalaman dan rekomendasi bagaimana menerapkan sistem sosio-ekologi, 
dan model sato-umi dan analisis di negara-negara berkembang sekitar Pasifik Utara. Sebagai tanggapan 
atas dua pertanyaan utama yang diajukan pada awal proyek ini, kami mengusulkan kesimpulan sebagai 
berikut. 
(a) Bagaimana ekosistem laut dapat mendukung kesejahteraan manusia? 
Pendekatan ilmiah secara tradisional melalui pemahaman pengetahuan tentang biofisika untuk menjawab 
pertanyaan ini, sering dibatasi dalam hal pemahaman tentang pasokan bahan pangan dan mata 
pencaharian. Namun, padangan yang sempit ini masih menyisakan masalah tentang kebutuhan psikologis 
yang sangat penting dan diperlukan masyarakat pesisir agar dapat mengelola sumberdaya laut dengan 
baik dan berkelanjutan.  Karena dalam kenyataannya, kebutuhan psikologis dan kondisi fisik sumberdaya 
laut sangat dibutuhkan untuk mendukung kesejahteraan masyarakat pesisir secara positif.  
(b) Bagaimana masyarakat dapat mendukung kelestarian dan produktivitas ekosistem laut?  
Pertanyaan ini merupakan pertanyaan timbal balik terhadap pernyataan di atas dan pandangan yang 
terpusat kepada masalah sosial, dengan fokus pada masyarakat dan apa yang mereka lakukan, atau dapat 
mereka lakukan untuk menjamin atau memperbaiki stabilitas ekosistem laut, mengingat  kegiatan 
masyarakat dapat merugikan atau menguntungkan kelestarian ekosistem laut. Kegiatan masyarakat  
menjadi pertimbangan yang perlu mendapat perhatian,  ketika kondisi  biofisik ekosistem laut mengalami 
tekanan, seperti masalah perubahan iklim. Konsep tentang apa yang dapat dilakukan masyarakat untuk 
menjaga stabilitas dan kelestarian ekosistem laut merupakan inti dari konsep yang dikembangkan Jepang 
dengan nama sato-umi.  
Salah satu pelajaran yang sangat berharga dari hasil studi ini adalah bagaimana pentingnya 
menghubungkan suatu organisasi di setiap negara yang dapat memfasilitasi dan mengembangkan suatu 
proyek. Untuk melakukan penelitian tentang model sistem sosio-ekologi secara efektif dan efisien, 
diperlukan adanya hubungan yang erat dengan organisasi dan pemegang kunci yang memahami konsep 
sistem sosia-ekologi kelautan, dan dapat menerjemahkannya ke dalam konteks kedaerahan sesuai dengan 
potensi sumberdaya lautnya.

Resumen Ejecutivo 
Se están logrando avances internacionales en la aplicación de un enfoque ecosistémico a la 
administración de los sistemas marinos, en particular en lo que respecta a la gestión pesquera basada en 
consideraciones del ecosistema integral. Este concepto se ha ampliado recientemente para incluir a seres 
humanos en lo que hoy se conoce como sistemas marinos socio-ecológicos acoplados. Tales conceptos 
pueden proporcionar una comprensión integrada de cómo los cambios del ecosistema afectan sistemas 
sociales-humanos, y viceversa. Este concepto integrado de comprensión de los sistemas socio-ecológicos 
en las zonas costeras con el fin de lograr un equilibrio sostenible entre estos dos sistemas se denomina 
sato-umi (pueblo-mar) en japonés. En 2012, PICES inició un proyecto integrado de investigación de 
sistemas socio-ecológicos denominado “Salud de Ecosistemas Marinos y Bienestar Humano (MarWeB)”, 
financiado por el Ministerio de Agricultura, Silvicultura y Pesca del Japón. Las preguntas clave del 
proyecto fueron: a) ¿Cómo sustentan los ecosistemas marinos el bienestar humano? Y b) ¿Cómo apoyan 
las comunidades humanas ecosistemas marinos sostenibles y productivos? Este informe es el resumen de 
los resultados del proyecto MarWeB. 
En este informe se introducen diversas herramientas sociales y científicas naturales utilizando datos 
actuales de estudios de casos para ejemplificar cómo realizar análisis de sistemas socio-ecológicos para 
comunidades dependientes de recursos marinos. La segunda sección ofrece una visión general de la 
investigación novedosa a nivel nacional sobre cómo las naciones miembras de PICES y una de las 
naciones de estudio de caso perciben sus interacciones con el mar. Esta sección establece los conceptos 
generales de cómo las personas interactúan con el mar e identifica importantes diferencias nacionales. Se 
utiliza los conceptos de bienestar humano e implica la evaluación de las vidas e interacciones de los 
pueblos con el mar, como las emociones positivas, el compromiso, la satisfacción y el significado. 
Debido a que los ecosistemas marinos proporcionan una gran variedad de servicios ecosistémicos, se 
necesita algún tipo de “función de peso relatvio” para asignar los limitados recursos humanos y 
financieros para proteger / conservar los servicios ecosistémicos de manera socialmente apropiada. El 
desafío aquí es que cada sociedad o país tiene sus prioridades específicas basadas en sus antecedentes 
culturales e históricos. Al mismo tiempo, para analizar los enfoques de sistemas socio-ecológicos a escala 
de todo el Pacífico Norte, es necesario comprender las diferencias y las similitudes en la estructuración 
del bienestar entre estos países. 
La tercera sección presenta un resumen del primer estudio de caso sobre la acuicultura de camarón en 
Indonesia. En este estudio, las necesidades locales fueron evidentes desde el principio, incluyendo la 
prevención de la erosión de la tierra por los estanques de camarón abandonados después de la ocurrencia 
de enfermedades de camarón por operaciones de acuicultura excesivamente intensivas. Para reducir las 
emisiones de efluentes de alto contenido de nutrientes en la zona costera, se sugirió la tecnología de la 
acuicultura multi-trófica integrada (IMTA) para llevar a cabo la acuicultura con múltiples especies de 
manera sostenible. También se introdujeron técnicas científicas para monitorear los impactos a los 
ecosistemas marinos locales. La cuarta sección resume los resultados de las evaluaciones de las 
necesidades de la comunidad y los intentos de implementar la acuicultura de ostras en las comunidades

costeras de Guatemala. Guatemala representa un caso de “abajo hacia arriba” e Indonesia uno de “arriba 
hacia abajo” como ejemplos de diferentes maneras para abordar la implementación de los conceptos de 
sato-umi. La quinta sección describe la situación actual con la introducción a nivel nacional de áreas 
marinas protegidas en Palau. 
La sexta sección presenta comparaciones entre los estudios de casos específicos. En la sección final, la 
séptima sección, se presentan las conclusiones, las lecciones aprendidas y las recomendaciones sobre 
cómo llevar a cabo los análisis socio-ecológicos y de tipo sato-umi en los países en desarrollo alrededor 
del Pacífico Norte. En respuesta a las dos preguntas claves planteadas al inicio de este proyecto, 
ofrecemos las siguientes conclusiones: 
 (a) ¿Cómo contribuyen los ecosistemas marinos al bienestar humano? 
El enfoque “tradicional” de las ciencias biofísicas de esta cuestión suele estar enmarcado en términos de 
suministro de alimentos y medios de subsistencia. Sin embargo, este marco estrecho deja fuera las 
necesidades psicológicas muy importantes de cómo la gente se relaciona con el mar. En realidad, las 
necesidades psicológicas y físicas son necesarias para un bienestar humano positivo. 
 (b) ¿Cómo apoyan las comunidades humanas ecosistemas marinos sostenibles y productivos? 
Esta es la pregunta recíproca a la anterior. Se trata de una visión más centrada en las ciencias sociales, 
centrada en las personas y en lo que hacen o pueden hacer para asegurar o mejorar ecosistemas marinos 
sanos. Las acciones de las personas pueden ser perjudiciales o beneficiosas para los ecosistemas marinos. 
Estas acciones son aún más importantes a tener en cuenta cuando los ecosistemas marinos biofísicos ya 
están estrésados, por ejemplo, debido a un cambio climático. Este concepto de lo que la gente puede hacer 
para cultivar ecosistemas marinos sanos es el núcleo del concepto japonés de sato-umi. 
Una de las lecciones más sólidas que se extrajeron de estos estudios fue la importancia de conectarse con 
las organizaciones de cada país para facilitar y avanzar el proyecto. Con el fin de llevar a cabo la 
investigación de sistemas socio-ecológicos de una manera efectiva y eficiente, se necesitan conexiones 
estrechas con estas organizaciones y personas clave para entender el concepto de sistemas ecológicos 
marino-sociales y para poder traducirlo a un contexto local.

1.1 What is marine ecosystem health, human well-being, and a marine 
social-ecological systems approach? 
Progress is being made internationally on an ecosystem approach to the management of marine systems, 
in particular as applied to ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM: e.g., FAO, 2003; Hollowed et 
al., 2011).  Recent initiatives have expanded the concept of ecosystem approaches to include people in 
what have been called coupled marine social-ecological systems (e.g., De Young et al., 2008; Perry et al., 
2010; Ommer et al., 2011).  Good scientific (biophysical or ecological) arguments for management actions 
are sometimes not accepted or implemented because of the perceived socio-economic or cultural costs.  
An integrated understanding of how ecosystem changes affect human social systems, and vice versa, is 
essential to improve the stewardship of marine ecosystems (Makino and Criddle, 2013).  Social-
ecological systems are integrated complex systems that include social (human) and ecological 
(biophysical) subsystems in complex feedback relationships (Berkes, 2011).  These types of relationships 
occur whenever people interact with the environment (Armitage et al., 2017). 
PICES has contributed to this progress and explored regional applications of these concepts in the North 
Pacific, through several studies on ecosystem-based management (Jamieson et al., 2005; 2010; Makino 
and Fluharty, 2011).  In addition, PICES formed an expert group in 2011 to link the human dimensions of 
marine ecosystems with the more natural science-based activities of the organization (in what has now, in 
2017, become a full scientific committee of PICES http://www.pices.int/members/committees/HD).  The 
second PICES integrative science program, FUTURE (Forecasting and Understanding Trends, Uncertainty 
and Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems), also has strong linkages with ecosystems and people, 
which are embedded within its three primary research questions (see below). 
Tett et al. (2013) provided a discussion of marine ecosystem health, in particular as it is becoming framed 
in emerging national legislations.  They suggested that it should be viewed as an aggregate of 
contributions from organisms, species and processes within a defined area rather than a single property of 
an ecosystem.  Generic features include: primary photosynthetic production of organic matter is roughly 
in balance with consumption; nutrient supplies are adequate to support community structure and function; 
there is sufficient biodiversity to fulfill the necessary bio-geochemical roles; the community structure 
includes multiple trophic levels and a variety of trophic links between levels; and individual organisms 
are healthy and reproductively fit.  It is important to note that this definition recognizes the localized or 
defined area aspects of these relationships, and therefore the issue of how people “see” or frame their

environment.  Work by PICES scientists on issues of marine ecosystem-based management approaches 
has found conceptual differences among PICES member countries with respect to what constitutes a 
“healthy” ecosystem (Jamieson et al., 2010), for example, how to have productive and biodiverse marine 
ecosystems which include people.  Canada, Russia and the United States have generally more natural 
coastal systems which they are trying to maintain, whereas China, Japan and Korea are dominated by 
human-influenced marine systems.  These different perceptions about ocean health lead to different 
management objectives and strategies, such as marine protected areas, regulations on fisheries and 
aquaculture, and relative emphases on human and non-human needs.  These concepts can also be 
expanded to developing countries, where the immediate issues are often framed in terms of “needs for 
immediate sustenance” versus “sustainability” of the marine ecosystem and its fish populations for 
current and future use. 
Recently, the concept of human well-being within marine social-ecological systems has become 
recognized as an important step forward (Coulthard et al., 2011; Charles, 2012).  Well-being shifts the 
perspective from objective measures of sustainable livelihoods (comprised of the physical, social, human, 
natural, and financial resources available to a community or country) to include the subjective and relational 
well-being of individuals and communities.  This represents a shift from people as exploiters of the ocean 
to people as integral components of resource sustainability and ecosystem health (Coulthard et al., 2011; 
Charles, 2012).  Therefore, taking account of the dynamics of livelihoods and application of well-being 
can help in the development of policies supporting sustainable and resilient marine social-ecological 
systems (Charles, 2012).  Weeretunge et al. (2014) define human well-being in fisheries contexts as a 
broad concept of social benefits, including both material and non-material goals, such as economic yield, 
food supplies, employment, safe and non-discriminatory work conditions in fisheries and preservation of 
ecological values of marine and coastal ecosystems.  Jentoft (2000, p. 53) wrote that “viable communities 
are also an important contribution to the preservation of healthy fish stocks.  Thus, before one can hope to 
rebuild fish stocks, one must start to rebuild communities.” 
Within a social-ecological systems approach, people are indispensable parts of the system.  When setting 
the objectives of research or the definitions of success, participation of the local (fishing) human 
community is crucial.  The Japanese concept of sato-umi represents one version of this humans-in-nature 
approach in which a healthy ecosystem is seen to nourish human well-being, but human activities are 
seen as necessary for sustaining ecosystem health.  Sato means community or village, and umi means sea. 
Therefore, sato-umi refers to human communities that have long-standing relationships with marine 
environments, and in which human interactions have resulted in high marine productivity and biodiversity 
(Makino, 2011, p. 126; Makino and Fluharty, 2011; United Nations University Institute of Advanced 
Studies Operating Unit Ishikawa/Kanazawa, 2011).  One example is the eelgrass re-establishment and 
recovery activities undertaken by local community members in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan (Ota and 
Torii, 2011).  Similar types of sea grass and kelp restoration activities have been proposed by local 
communities in the Strait of Georgia, Canada.  The Japanese government has undertaken integrated 
studies to assess the contributions of social, cultural, economic, and ecological aspects in sato-umi type 
projects in Japan, as part of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Sub-Global Assessment program. 
As detailed in this report, the identification of local community needs and perceptions about what makes 
a “good ecosystem” is an important part of designing the scientific analyses and field experiments.  This 
is a necessary process to ensure the research is really intended for the (fishing) community and its people, 
and not only for the interests of the researchers.  Based on the local community needs, or their perception 
of their needs, scientific analyses can be developed to meet those needs and perceptions.

1.2 Project formation and funding support 
In 2012, PICES accepted a request from the Government of Japan to undertake a 5-year project on 
“Marine ecosystem health and human well-being” to be funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan, through the Fisheries Agency of Japan (JFA).  The project began in April 
2012 and was completed in March 2017.  The MAFF contribution was from the Official Development 
Assistance (ODA) Fund and therefore, involvement of developing Pacific Rim countries in project activities 
was required. 
The project was directed by a Project Science Team (PST) co-chaired by Drs. Mitsutaku Makino 
(Fisheries Research and Education Agency, Japan) and R. Ian Perry (Department of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Canada.  All PST members are identified in Appendix 1.  The PST Co-Chairmen were responsible for the 
scientific implementation of the project and annual reporting to MAFF/JFA and PICES Science Board.  
Dr. Alexander Bychkov served as the Project Coordinator and was responsible for the management of the 
fund and for reporting annually on its disposition to MAFF/JFA and PICES Governing Council. 
The over-arching project goal was to identify the relationships between sustainable human communities 
and productive marine ecosystems in the North Pacific, under the concept of fishery social-ecological 
systems. In Japan, this concept attracts attention as the sato-umi fisheries management system. 
Considering that global changes are affecting both climate and human social and economic conditions, 
the key questions of the project were defined as:  
(a) How do marine ecosystems support human well-being? 
(b)  How do human communities support sustainable and productive marine ecosystems? 
To achieve these goals, a program of novel research and case studies, involving both the biophysical and 
social sciences, was constructed, with three developing countries initially selected for the locations of the 
case studies. 
1.3 Structure of this report 
In this report, various social and natural scientific tools are introduced with real data to exemplify how to 
conduct social-ecological systems analysis for marine-dependent communities.  Section 2 provides an 
overview of novel research at the national level on how the member countries of PICES and one of the 
case study nations (Indonesia) perceive their interactions with the sea.  This section sets the general 
concept for how people interact with the sea, and identifies important national differences.  It uses the 
concepts of human well-being, and involves peoples’ evaluations of their lives and interactions with the 
sea, such as positive emotions, engagement, satisfaction, and meaning (Diener and Seligman, 2004).  
Because marine ecosystems provide a wide-variety of ecosystem services, some kind of “weighting 
function” is needed in order to allocate the limited human and financial resources to protect/conserve 
ecosystem services in socially appropriate ways.  The challenge here is that each society or country has its 
specific priorities based on their cultural and historical backgrounds.  Community needs assessment 
approach is a useful tool to identify these priorities at the community scale.  At the same time, in order to 
discuss social-ecological systems approaches at the scale of the entire North Pacific, understanding the 
differences and commonalities in how well-being is structured among these countries is needed.

Section 3 presents a summary of the first case study focusing on shrimp aquaculture in Indonesia.  Here, 
the local needs were apparent from the beginning, including the prevention of land erosion by abandoned 
shrimp ponds after the occurrence of shrimp diseases from excessively intensive aquaculture operations.  
To help bust economic returns and to reduce emissions of high-nutrient effluents into the coastal zone, 
integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) technology was introduced to conduct multi-species 
aquaculture in a sustainable manner.  Also, scientific techniques to monitor impacts to the local marine 
ecosystems were presented.  A commodity chain analysis was carried out to demonstrate how IMTA can 
affect human well-being. 
Section 4 summarises the results from community needs assessments and attempts to implement oyster 
aquaculture in coastal communities of Guatemala.  Guatemala represents a “bottom up” example and 
Indonesia a “top down” example of different approaches to implementing sato-umi concepts. Detailed 
results from the studies in sections 2, 3, and 4 are being prepared for publication in the scholarly scientific 
literature. 
Section 5 describes a site visit to Palua as the proposed third case study location.  However, for reasons 
described in this section and for funding reasons, further activities in Palau were not implemented. 
Section 6 focuses on comparisons among the case studies.  As the final section, Section 7 includes 
conclusions, lessons learned and recommendations for how to conduct social-ecological systems (sato-
umi type) analyses in developing countries around the North Pacific.  This section also briefly describes the 
guide/manual for practioners who wish to develop social-ecosystem system/sato-umi approaches in other 
areas, and the database that was developed during this project.  Appendices are included with additional 
information from PST meeting reports, scientific sessions, and published articles produced during this 
project.

2.1 Well-being analysis 
Many social and psychological methodologies have contributed to a better understanding of one’s sense 
of value or well-being.  While economists focus mainly on economic utility or material wealth (Stevenson 
and Wolfers, 2008), psychologists have been concentrating more on cultural values in individualism 
(Diener et al., 1993; Hofstede, 2001; Diener and Saligman, 2002).  In this section we introduce two 
approaches for assessing human well-being.  The first approach is people’s levels of “satisfaction” using 
the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment’s (2005) five components of human well-being as dependent 
variables.  The second is the “well-being cube”, which is composed of 35 “human needs” determined by 
psychology.  It can be used to evaluate the detailed characteristics of people’s desired choices and actions 
in their relationships with the sea and marine ecosystems. 
2.2 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment well-being analysis 
“Well-being” involves peoples’ positive evaluations of their lives, such as positive emotions, engagement, 
satisfaction, and meaning (Diener and Saligman, 2004; Oscar, 2011).  According to the definition by the 
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA, 2005), human well-being (HWB) has multiple constituents 
including “Security”, “Basic material for a good life”, “Health”, “Good social relationships” and 
“Freedom of choice and action” (Fig. 2.1). 
The strength of the linkages and the potential for mediation differ in different ecosystems and regions, 
and with different socioeconomic factors which mediate the linkages (MEA, 2005).  However, the 
interactions among the five components of human well-being in relation to the sea have not been 
investigated in previous studies. 
Since the concept of human well-being was suggested as a tool for evaluating the subjective benefits 
derived from ecosystems and environments (MEA, 2005), increasing attention has been paid to the 
interaction between ecosystems and human society because natural environments are affected by this 
interdependence (a social-ecological system: Berkes et al., 2003; Folke et al., 2005; Berkes and Ross, 
2013; Reyers et al., 2013).  Thus, evaluation of the subjective aspects as well as the economic value of 
ecosystems (i.e., ecosystem services) has been considered important for comprehensive evaluation of the 
value of specific ecosystems and environments (Rice, 2014; Garcia et al., 2015).

2.2.1 Sampling design and questionnaire 
The MEA well-being analysis is based on the responses to a web survey utilizing an internet questionnaire 
or face-to-face interviews.  Here, we use data from the MarWeB database
1
 in which six PICES member 
countries are included.  The residence of potential respondents was restricted to within a one hour’s drive 
by car from the coast, in order to minimize the geographical effects in each country.  The responses were 
obtained in May 2013 in Japan, August 2013 in the U.S. (Pacific coast), September 2013 in Korea, 
October 2015 in China, December 2015 in Russia (Pacific coast), and April 2016 in Canada (Pacific 
coast).  Table 2.1 provides the demographics of respondents in each country, with a grand total of 3,238 
responses. 
Questionnaire items were selected and grouped according to the five components of human well-being 
(“Basic material for a good life”, “Health”, “Good social relations”, “Security”, and “Freedom of choice 
and action”), as defined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA, 2005).  Three to five items 
were selected for each component: three items for “Freedom of choice and action”, four each for 
“Health”, “Good social relations” and “Security”, and five for “Basic material for a good life”.  As a 
result, a total of 20 items were used in the questionnaire (Table 2.2).  Each item was scored by each 
respondent based on a five-point Likert-type scale, depending on the satisfaction level: 5 = very satisfied, 
4 = satisfied, 3 = neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 2 = dissatisfied and 1 = very dissatisfied.  The average 
and standard deviation of the satisfaction scores were calculated for each item and country.

2.2.2 Example of the analysis and interpretation 
The basic structure of the components of human well-being can be revealed using a structural equation 
modelling (SEM) approach on the data from the questionnaires.  All statistical analyses were conducted 
using the standard statistic software, such as SPSS Statistics Version 23 (IBM), or SPSS Statistics AMOS 
Version 23 (IBM).  The data from the MarWeB database were used to show how the analysis was 
conducted. 
Structural equation modelling (Duncan, 1975; Wakita et al., 2014) was applied to examine possible 
interactions among the five components of human well-being.  First, in order to understand the basic 
structure of human well-being, SEM was run with the satisfaction scores as dependent variables, based on 
pooled data obtained from the six PICES member countries.  The goodness-of-fit index (GFI), adjusted 
goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), comparative fit index (CFI), and the root mean square error of approximation 
(RMSEA) are used as indices for determining the adequacy of the model (Browne and Cudeck, 1992; Hu 
and Bentler, 1999; Rhoades and OʼLeary, 2007; Table 2.3).  The model is reliable when GFI, AGFI and 
CFI are close to 1, and RMSEA < 0.05 (Rhoades and OʼLeary, 2007).  Standardized partial regression 
coefficients ( β) were calculated in order to investigate the interaction (direction and strength of effects) 
between the components of human well-being.

being cube” analysis.

The SEM analysis showed high reliability of the model results (Fig. 2.2; chi-square (1) = 10.69, GFI = 
1.00，AGFI = 0.98，CFI = 1.00，RMSEA = 0.06).  In the model-based characterization of the components 
of human well-being, “Security” and “Basic material for a good life” functioned as fundamental variables 
affecting “Freedom of choice and action”, while “Good social relations” and “Health” were mediating 
variables for the other components. 
 
 
Fig. 2.2  Results of structural equation modelling (SEM) linkages among five components of human well-being.  
The data from six PICES member countries (n = 3238) were pooled for the analysis to investigate the basic structure 
of linkages among the five components of human well-being.  The best model fit is shown.  The thick arrow between 
“Security” and “Basic material for a good life” indicates interaction, and the number beside the arrow is an 
explanatory variable (coefficient of correlation = r).  Thin arrows between the components indicate one-way effects, 
and the numeralsbers beside the arrows are structural parameters (standard partial regression coefficient = β).

GFI = 1.00, AGFI = 0.93, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = 0.04).  The basic structure of the components of human 
well-being in each country were similar to those derived from the analysis using pooled data from the six 
member countries (Fig. 2.3), with “Security” and “Basic material for a good life” functioning as 
fundamental variables, and “Freedom of choice and action” as a dependent variable.

2.3 Human “well-being cube” analysis 
The other analytical tool, derived from psychological research, is called the “well-being cube”.  At the 
first Project Science Team meeting in Hiroshima (October 11, 2012; see Appendix 3), Ms. Juri Hori and 
Dr. Mitsutaku Makino presented definitions for human well-being from psychological research, and 
described the concept of the “well-being cube”.  In this approach, a person’s (or community, region, 
country) perception of their well-being can be located in one or more of 27 cells defined by three axes, 
each with three categories: the extent of conscious interpretation of their situation, their level of active 
response to their situation, and their view of how they fit into their world (Perry and Makino, 2013).  
After discussion with the PICES Section on Human Dimensions of Marine Systems (now the PICES 
Human Dimension  Committee), the “well-being cube” was developed, composed of 35 “human needs” 
as determined by psychology, which can be used to evaluate the detailed characteristics of people’s 
desired choices and actions in regard to their relationships with the sea (Fig. 2.4). 
 
Fig. 2.4 The “well-being cube”.  The 27 characteristics in the upper part of the figure are considered as 
constructing a cube with axes of Personal needs to Social needs; Active needs to Static needs, and Primitive (or 
basic) needs to Reasonable needs.  The eight characteristics along the bottom represent additional social needs.

2.3.1 Sampling design and questionnaire 
The same data from the six PICES member countries in the MarWeB database were used for this analysis.  
The “well-being cube” (Fig. 2.4) was assessed using 35 items (Table 2.4).  Each item was scored by each 
respondent based on a five-point Likert-type scale, depending on the satisfaction level and the expectation 
level: 5 = very satisfied/high expectation, 4 = satisfied/some expectation, 3 = neither satisfied nor 
dissatisfied/neither expectation nor no expectation, 2 = dissatisfied/low expectation, and 1 = very 
dissatisfied/no expectation.  The average and standard deviation of the satisfaction scores were calculated 
for each item and country.

2.3.2 Example of the analysis and interpretation  
Internet surveys were conducted for the six PICES member countries.  The sample numbers were 550 for 
Canada and China, 468 for Japan, 540 for Korea, 574 for Russia, and 556 for USA.  All the respondents 
resided within a one hour driving distance from the coast.  The results are summarized in a cube diagram 
(Fig. 2.5).  Red shows high expectation and satisfaction, blue shows low expectation and satisfaction, 
yellow shows high expectation and low satisfaction, and green shows low expectation and high 
satisfaction.  Some initial findings included the fact that all countries surveyed have similar general 
concepts of human well-being with regard to marine ecosystems.  However, the specific understanding of 
how the marine ecosystem affects human well-being varies among the countries and, therefore, what 
makes for a desirable relationship between people and the sea is different among countries. 
Some of the common features among the six member countries include general perceptions of current 
conditions, and future prospects.  For example, the satisfaction and expectations for “Impression” were 
high in all the countries.  This may be interpreted as people in PICES member countries are generally 
satisfied and have higher expectations of the future, regardless of their ecological condition, economic 
situation, and culture.  In contrast, satisfaction and expectation levels for “Identification”, “Collection”, 
and “Competition” were statistically low in all member countries.  This may reflect higher uncertainty 
about the future of marine social and ecological systems.  Further investigations of these data are 
underway, and will be presented elsewhere.

2.4 Conclusions 
The results from the multiple group structural equation modelling (Fig. 2.3) show that the basic structure 
of the components of human well-being in PICES member countries are similar, with “Security” and 
“Basic material for a good life” functioning as fundamental variables, and “Freedom of choice and 
action” as a dependent variable.  At the same time, the relative importance, or “connections” among the 
components vary from country to country.  The “well-being cube” analysis, which is based on psychological 
needs theory, can provide more details of such differences among countries (Fig. 2.5).  Some countries 
believe that certain specific aspects are more important than other.  For example, only people in Russia 
had high expectations for social needs, and they were often met; the other five countries had low 
expectations for social needs and low satisfaction in having those met; and all countries (except Russia) 
had high expectations for personal needs and these were often satisfied. 
Understanding the differences among countries is an important first step towards building a consensus for 
larger-scale marine conservation activities.  This is also important information for domestic policy 
makers, to allocate the limited human and financial resources for ecosystem conservation activities in 
order to efficiently maximize the well-being of their people.  From the science perspective, this information 
can be used to design research frameworks for marine ecosystem conservation and experiments in order 
to better address local people’s concerns and recognition of critical issues.

Indonesia is a developing country, with a rapidly developing economy and a good relationship with other 
nations.  The region of Karawang (Fig. 3.1) quickly embraced the development of pond aquaculture more 
than 10 years ago, but disease since has destroyed much of the shrimp aquaculture, leading to large-scale 
abandonment of ponds, catastrophic erosion, and degradation of a large portion of the frontal coastline.  
Fish are plentiful in the local markets, but are very small.  Local pond aquaculture has been rebounding 
slowly, with much of it being low-intensity programs using traditional, low-technology approaches.  
Economic returns from these activities are vital in these communities, and MarWeB’s focus was to 
identify successful methods for integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) to help boost economic 
returns, while at the same time reducing the deleterious effects of pond operations on the water quality in 
the coastal areas. 
 
Fig. 3.1  Location of Karawang city, Java Island, Indonesia, and the brackish water pond experimental site. 
Case Study 1:  Indonesia Section 3 
18 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
The Indonesia case study has two components: (1) a natural science-based study of IMTA methods for 
improving the economic return of shrimp and tilapia pond aquaculture, and (2) a social science-based 
study of markets and human benefits to better understand the potential linkages for further economic 
development of pond aquaculture and natural fisheries. 
3.1 Natural science studies  
3.1.1 Project background 
The concept of sato-umi is where human intervention in coastal and marine areas can increase productivity 
and diversity of fishery resources, while at the same time maintaining ecosystem resilience.  In this case 
study, we investigated different forms of IMTA in brackish water shrimp and tilapia ponds for the 
purpose of achieving three goals: (1) maintaining successful production of the primary economic product 
(shrimp or tilapia), (2) adding economic return to farmers through co-production of other cultured 
products in ponds, and (3) reducing nutrient discharge from pond operations into coastal waters and 
thereby improving water quality and reducing adverse impacts on coastal ecosystems. 
To be clear, many aquaculture companies utilize medium- and high-intensity production systems that, 
while enhancing production, are expensive and highly sensitive to small variations.  There is high risk for 
failure in these lucrative operations, so the companies have little motivation to experiment given the 
uncertainties that IMTA can introduce.  Our focus was on developing methods and approaches for low-
intensity, low-technology, and limited financial resource conditions that describe community-scale, 
traditional aquaculture in Karawang.  The project outcomes are intended to have tangible effects on 
improving human well-being at the community level. 
Traditional pond aquaculture, practiced by local communities in Karawang and elsewhere in Indonesia, is 
distinguished from larger-scale commercial operations by their simplicity.  Shrimp are stocked in open-air 
dirt ponds at approximately 15 shrimp per m
2
 versus ≥ 300 shrimp per m
2
 in concrete tanks for many 
high-intensity aquaculture operations (similar differences exist in the relative levels of tilapia stocking).  
The lower density operations generally remove the need for mixing and aeration tools, such as water 
wheels, that require electricity.  These simplified pond systems are logistically very amenable for 
experimentation with IMTA. 
The MarWeB team worked closely with Indonesian colleagues at the Agency for The Assessment and 
Application of Technology (BPPT) in Jakarta, and the National Center for Brackishwater Aquaculture 
(NCBA) in Karawang towards this goal.  The NCBA has experienced, high-quality laboratory analytical 
capabilities for standard shrimp pond aquaculture operations, but did not have analytical expertise in 
dissolved nutrient analyses or in phytoplankton identification, particularly for toxic algal species.  A 
MarWeB training workshop held in March 2014 addressed these limitations for both NCBA staff and a 
number of other local interested participants.  Armed with this new analytical capacity, the joint 
MarWeB-Indonesian team conducted three pond experiments over the three remaining years of the project. 
A critical aspect in the experimental design was recognition that these were “community and scientist” 
endeavours, rather than “scientist and community” experimental programs.  Farmers and communities are 
critically dependent on the successful growth of the primary aquaculture product (shrimp or tilapia).  
Failure of the pond due to disease or other IMTA-related factors would have devastating impacts on their 
Section 3  Case Study 1:  Indonesia 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 19 
well-being; without any economic buffers in these communities, failure can mean hunger or malnutrition.  
The other consideration was that while our goal was to reduce nutrient loads, high phytoplankton biomass 
is a critical component of traditional pond aquaculture practices.  High phytoplankton biomass is essential 
as an additional feed source but, more importantly, as a barrier to block light from reaching the floor of 
the ~1 m deep ponds to limit the growth of grass.  So, while one goal of the project is to reduce dissolved 
nutrients in the pond, there is great concern among farmers that this reduction not be to the detriment of 
their operations. 
Traditional pond aquaculture operations follow scientific and empirically developed procedures, but in 
practice it remains somewhat of an art.  A key enabler for our research goals was the lead aquaculturist at 
the NCBA who, while keenly focused on efficient shrimp and tilapia production, was willing to consider 
modifying conditions in their ponds to evaluate IMTA outcomes.  The importance of this individual in the 
community cannot be overstated.  His years of experience in the field, both in industry and at the NCBA, 
has led to him being held in high respect within the aquaculture community; his endorsement will be 
critical if new aquaculture practices are to be adopted in the community.  So, while a purely scientific 
IMTA study design would push the pond system to determine the boundaries for failure, reports of pond 
failure to the broader community would condemn all future efforts to implement IMTA.  We, therefore, 
heavily relied on the lead aquaculturist’s sense of trepidation in our experimental designs, which greatly 
limited the amounts of other aquaculture species incorporated in these early experiments. 
3.1.2 The pond experiments 
Our initial experimental pond system in 2014 comprised four 4000 m
2 
ponds at the NCBA in Karawang 
to test whether the addition of Gracilaria, a macroalgal genus widely cultured in Indonesia and elsewhere 
for both food and industrial processing, and the local clam Anadara, affected production of the whiteleg 
shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and a halotolerant Tilapia sp. developed by BPPT.  In addition to 
potential economic benefits of Gracilaria co-culture, there is anecdotal evidence that it can restrict 
pathogen growth which could increase the likelihood of successful pond production. 
Our IMTA concept was straightforward: the addition of feed to the ponds leads to increased nutrient 
concentrations that, in turn, fuel growth of Gracilaria in addition to phytoplankton (Fig. 3.2).  
Phytoplankton, in turn, nourish the growth of Anadara, and phytoplankton consumption leads to more 
light and thus more phytoplankton growth, drawing nutrients down further.  Overall, the excess production 
of Gracilaria and Anadara in the ponds essentially is a “recovery” of lost feed components (and 
operational costs) that otherwise are released into the coastal waters, leading to degradation of the coastal 
ecosystem.  However, the larger-scale (4000 m
2
) pond project proved challenging, both in terms of 
acquiring and introducing the co-cultured species, and for sampling and management of the ponds.  The 
results showed no significant negative effects of Anadara or Gracilaria on the growth of shrimp or tilapia 
although disease in the shrimp control pond required its early harvest, thereby complicating our data 
interpretations.  There was very limited production by Anadara or Gracilaria, which had been cordoned 
into small net corrals to limit their interaction with shrimp or fish in the ponds.  As a consequence, there 
were no significant differences in the level of dissolved nutrients at the end of the month experiment. 
A smaller pond system (1000 m
2
) was created in 2015 to replicate the experiment.  In this case, the whiteleg 
shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and Tilapia sp. showed good growth in all treatments.   As before, the 
insertion of Gracilaria holdfasts in the pond sediments was limited to netted corrals, although Anadara 
was spread across the pond sediment interface.  The overall product yield of both shrimp and tilapia was 
Case Study 1:  Indonesia Section 3 
20 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
less than NCBA staff had hoped for, even in the controls, for reasons that presumably were related to the 
water source.  Due to the pond locations they were filled mainly with pumped brackish groundwater rather 
than the normally used brackish canal waters.  The overall health of these primary aquaculture products 
(the economic mainstays) was good up until the final few days of the experiment when signs of stress 
were observed in all ponds at equal levels (i.e., there was no correlation with treatments or controls). 
Economic analysis showed that tilapia aquaculture, combined with the cost of Gracilaria used in the 
experiment, led to little if any additional profit.  However, the total expenses for IMTA in the shrimp 
ponds were less (due primarily to lower feed costs).  The economic contributions were low for both 
Gracilaria and Anadara because of their limited growth in the ponds, despite elevated levels of dissolved 
nutrients (for Gracilaria) and phytoplankton and detrital abundance (for Anadara).  All but the growing 
tips of Gracilaria were observed to be covered in fine black silt, indicating that growth would have been 
severely light limited.  Similarly, Anadara were rarely found open and feeding over the course of the 
experiment, suggesting stress associated either with hypoxic/anoxic pond sediments or the disturbance 
from shrimp foraging.  That, and recognition that bivalves are not consumed commonly in Karwang 
communities, led us to discontinue the testing of Anadara in our system. 
The 2016 pond experiment concentrated on IMTA with shrimp and Gracilaria, for logistics considerations 
and expectation that the simplicity of a two-species IMTA stands a better chance of being implemented 
by community growers.  Two changes were made.  First, the abundance of Gracilaria added in the 
previous experiment (0.1 kg/m
2
) was too low to have any major impact on dissolved nutrients.  However, 
the repeated demonstration that Gracilaria did not negatively impact shrimp (or tilapia) growth gave our 
lead aquaculturist confidence that larger amounts could be added.  Initial consultations centered on 
increasing this addition by up to 20 × (2 kg/m
2
), but a more conservative approach was decided upon in 
which three biomass levels were tested: 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 kg/m
2
 of Gracilaria.

environmental impact (graphic provided by National Center for Brackishwater Aquaculture (NCBA), Karawang, 
Indonesia). 
Section 3  Case Study 1:  Indonesia 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 21 
The second change was in how the Gracilaria was incorporated into the ponds.  In the previous experiments 
it was attached to the bottom with only its tips reaching the pond surface.  This orientation, plus the 
buildup of silt on the macroalgal surfaces, led to what we believed was light limitation of growth of 
Gracilaria in 2015.  For the 2016 experiment, Gracilaria was placed into bamboo floating rafts, keeping 
it at the pond surface and thereby increasing the light intensities to which it is exposed.  The amount of 
Gracilaria per raft was roughly uniform (beginning with only partial coverage), with more rafts being 
used in the higher Gracilaria abundance treatments.  Additionally, the rafts were shaken each week to 
remove, to the extent possible, sorbed and settled silt on the macroalgae, which visually seemed to be 
effective. 
The experimental outcome was a success in that shrimp production was good for traditional pond 
methods, the harvest quality of shrimp was high, and Gracilaria roughly doubled in mass over the first  
60 days of the experiment.  Gracilaria biomass subsequently remained stable, or increased only slightly, 
between Day 60 and the harvest (Day 110) in the pond treatments.  This plateau in biomass was not due 
to nutrient limitation, but instead was likely related, again, to light limitation from overcrowding of 
Gracilaria on the floating mats.  A partial harvest at Day 60 may likely have nearly doubled the Gracilaria 
production over the duration of the experiment. 
Dissolved nutrient concentrations in the pond varied with Gracilaria biomass, with the 0.4 kg/m
2
 pond 
treatment having lower concentrations of ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite than the 0.1 kg/m
2
 treatment.  This 
result was particularly true during the first half of the experiment when Gracilaria biomass was 
increasing.  However, nutrient concentrations remained high in all the treatments, and the proportional 
growth rates of Gracilaria were equal in all treatments.  By the end of the experiment, with ~45 days of 
little increase in Gracilaria biomass, the differences in dissolved nutrient concentrations among the 
treatments were small, as the continued input of feed overwhelmed the nutrient dynamics. 
Shrimp growth increased in the presence of Gracilaria, particularly in the 0.2 kg/m
2
 treatment.   Anecdotal 
observations suggest that this increase may have been related to a greater abundance of zooplankton 
feeding at the macroalgal surfaces, although this difference was not quantified.  This outcome indicates 
that future work should examine the potential role of macroalgae in facilitating zooplankton production in 
brackish water pond aquaculture. 
Surprisingly, the dissolved nutrient concentrations were lowest in the control pond (containg no Gracilaria), 
which appears to run counter to the expectation that the growth of co-cultured macroalgae in the ponds 
would be a sink for nutrients.  There are two potential reasons for this unexpected outcome.  First, a local 
variety of grass began growing rapidly in the control pond within the first month of the experiment.  This 
occurrence is not uncommon in traditional aquaculture, and normally is accompanied by lower 
phytoplankton abundance (assessed by water color).  Our measurements confirmed that phytoplankton 
cell numbers were lowest in the control relative to the IMTA treatments, and this outcome likely was 
related to low phosphate concentrations (~ 0.3 µM P).  These low phosphate concentrations persisted 
through Day 60, after which concentrations began to slowly increase.  The second factor to consider is 
that the grass was removed by hand after Day 30, which caused considerable disruption of the sediments 
(the grass roots were ~10 cm long).  Immediately following this removal there was a sharp, pulsed 
increase in the concentrations of nitrite and nitrate in the control pond that lasted until Day 60.  This 
resuspension/disturbance would have injected oxygen into the anoxic/hypoxic sediments, stimulating 
microbial nitrogen cycling processes.  The absence of significant co-occurring increases in ammonia 
Case Study 1:  Indonesia Section 3 
22 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
suggests that these pulses may indicate increased denitrification in the sediment and water column, 
although we cannot confirm this with our data. 
The lower phosphate concentrations in the control pond is likely related, in part, to uptake by the growing 
grass, but these low levels persisted for ~30 days after grass removal.  Chemical retention of phosphate in 
sediments by sorption with calcium carbonate and ferric (oxy)hydroxide surfaces is well established.  
Indonesian soils are rich in iron, and the pH, temperature, and brackish water conditions would be 
favorable for the precipitation of calcium carbonate.  The extensive sediment disruption, exposing new 
sediment surfaces to pond water, may have increased phosphorus removal from pond waters, although we 
cannot confirm this with our data. 
The collective findings of the MarWeB pond aquaculture experiments demonstrated that: 
 IMTA methods adding Gracilaria to shrimp and tilapia aquaculture ponds using low-intensity 
methods does not negatively affect production, and may in some cases increase shrimp growth; 
 Initial additions of 0.4 kg/m
2
 Gracilaria in floating rafts can double biomass in ~60 days, 
enhancing economic recovery from pond operations and contributing to markedly lower 
concentrations of dissolved nutrients; 
 Sediment disruption during pond aquaculture may lead to increased denitrification and phosphorus 
removal, reducing the nutrient loads released by aquaculture operations to coastal waters; and  
 Local grasses may be particularly effective in the removal of nutrients from pond wastewaters, 
suggesting a new approach to low-cost remediation methods to limit pond aquaculture impacts 
on coastal ecosystems.

3.2 Social science studies 
In Karawang, most shrimp aquaculture operations are destined for overseas markets in developed countries.  
The challenge, therefore, is to diversify and develop multispecies products and shift them to supply local 
markets, with the goals of local job creation, local consumption, and the improvement of community 
well-being. 
The social science studies of the Indonesia case study were intended to consider three broad questions: 
1. What are the people’s needs for marine ecosystem services in Indonesia? 
2. How can IMTA respond to these needs, and what are the ecological and social benefits to be 
delivered by IMTA? 
3. How can such effects contribute to human well-being?

Section 3  Case Study 1:  Indonesia 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 23 
Some aspects of these questions can be addressed by the “well-being cube” approach described in Section 2, 
whereas other aspects require field studies on how people in Indonesia actually affiliate with marine food.  
The overall goal for this case study was an attempt to introduce “change” to the community, leading to 
improved well-being in both the natural and social systems.  Here, social well-being is interpreted as 
having free time to spend with family and a wide variety of jobs (a varied seafood commodity chain).  An 
analysis for Indonesia was conducted using the “well-being cube” approach (Fig. 3.3).  The data
3
 were 
collected by interviewing 200 people in 2014.  According to the analysis, the key words for better well-
being for the people in this area of Indonesia included “Stability”, “Beneficial”, “Aesthetic (e.g. food 
culture and variety)”, and “Ability to change”. 
 
Fig. 3.3 “Well-being cube” analysis for Karawang, Indonesia.  See the caption to Fig. 2.5 for definition of the 
colour scheme. 
Therefore, the social science study in Karawang was designed to examine the effects of IMTA on these 
four keywords.  A commodity chain mapping approach was used to identify: (1) what kinds of local 
businesses are involved in seafood commodities and which ones might benefit from the outcomes of 
IMTA, (2) who are the consumers, and (3) how much of the multi-species products from IMTA 
operations (e.g., shrimp, milkfish, crabs, etc.) might potentially be consumed.  The hope was that by 
changing shrimp monoculture to IMTA it will be possible to build a sustainable pond culture system and 
suppress coastal pollution and erosion.  In addition, there is a high probability that this could lead to new 
and diverse job opportunities and ensure a rich variety of seafood available for consumption by the local 
communities. 
Commodity (or supply or value) chain mapping is accomplished by identifying the steps in the process of 
bringing goods from sourse to market.  It can be used at the local level, e.g., to identify the locations of

areas with inadequate access to food (Donkin et al., 1999).  A general approached is described at 
http://www.supplychainopz.com/2011/06/supply-chain-mapping.html, and a step-by-step process for 
building a commodity chain map is detailed in Box 3.1. 
The purposes of commodity chain mapping are: 
 Market – identify the features of the market, the flexibility of job creation and the spatial range; 
 Functions – identify the products of redistribution, value added, and the steps needed for a wide 
variety of products; 
 Participants – identify the stakeholders, including related persons and organizations; and 
 Rules – understand the regulation of business, the sentiments and cultures of the society and 
human relationships. 
In this study, commodity chain mapping was accomplished by in-person interviews in Karawang to 
identify for each seafood product (with a focus on those potentially derived from local IMTA), who buys, 
modifies, transports, and ultimately consumes the products (Fig. 3.4).  In the local food supply chain, the 
“collectors” are the people who obtain the seafood products from the source producer.  Their number has 
been increasing over the past few years, and the commodity chain of Karawang is highly dependent on 
their activity.  They are one of the most important stakeholders in seafood supply in Karawang.  
Collectors deliver their seafood to buyers, who may then sell this seafood to the export market, or to local 
markets (“pasar”), restaurants, or cottage processors.  These latter are the traditional way of processing 
seafood and can employ many local workers including family members.  Local people then buy and 
consume the seafood products from these various suppliers.  In the seafood export market, the main 
products from Karawang are shrimp and catfish.  These are usually transported to processors where they 
are frozen and exported abroad, or sometimes further processed in Indonesia as fish meal.

3.3 Conclusions 
Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) of shrimp, fish, clam, and macroalgal species was conducted to 
address the problem of mass diseases in shrimp mariculture activities, the coastal erosion of the coastline 
after the abandonment of the ponds, and to help reduce the release of nutrients to coastal waters caused by 
pond aquaculture.  The experiments show that IMTA can produce more products in terms of volume and 
number of species in a stable way, while decreasing the wastes from the pond to the sea.  The findings 
will help to chart the way forward toward more sustainable aquaculture activities in this region. 
The commodity chain mapping analysis showed that the introduction of IMTA can improve the human 
well-being in the Karawang area.  Safe seafood and the protection of land and coastline by IMTA can 
improve the sense of “Stability”.  More jobs and wealth created by IMTA through the commodity chain 
can improve the sense of “Beneficial” activities.  A wider variety of products from IMTA and better 
water quality can improve the “Aesthetic” sense.  Finally, the capacity building workshops organized by 
this project in 2013 and 2014 strengthened local peoples’ “Ability to change” for better social-ecological 
systems in Karawang.  These outcomes can improve human well-being as defined by the Millennium 
Ecosystem Assessment (2005), mainly by improving the conditions for “Basic material for a good life”.  
Ultimately, this will lead to “Freedom of choice and action” and to potentially a broader introduction of 
IMTA to produce a healthy and sustainable ecosystem for the people of Indonesia.

4.1 Project background  
In Guatemala, the removal of marine resources has no effective regulatory control.  While there is a 
proclaimed Guatemalan Fisheries and Aquaculture General Law, there are few regulations that influence 
the level of recreational, sport, community or commercial fisheries.  Yet, the fisheries are tremendously 
important to the coastal communities as the primary source of nutrition, jobs, social well-being and income.  
The ability of communities to access marine resources in this unregulated position, while the community 
population grows, is a classic problem of coastal communities around the world.  Marine resources in 
Guatemala are an example of the “Tragedy of the Commons” (Hardin, 1968) in action and have a clear 
community-at-risk concern as the community outgrows its dwindling resources (Ostrom et al., 2002). 
Guatemala has approximately 140 nautical miles of coastline along the Pacific coast.  A smaller shore 
along the Atlantic Ocean is also within the Guatemalan territorial waters, but this area is sparsely 
inhabited and poorly utilized with regard to fishing, making up about 10% of the fishing effort.  A 
summary of fishing activities from the Unión Nacional de Pescadores Conservacionista (UNIPESCA: 
http://www.unipesca.es) indicates that 95% of fishing activities are performed by small community-based 
boats (1400 boats) within 10 km from shore.  There are a small number of commercial boats (65) that 
extend their range to the allowable 200 km limit.  Several recent shifts are pertinent to this report: 
 The reduction of catch over the last two decades has brought the community fishing effort into 
the extensive (300 km long) coastal river and lagoon system.  UNIPESCA states that 100% of the 
resources extracted from the coastal system go to subsistence fishing. 
 There has been a great shift from pelagic fisheries to shrimp fisheries.  This is in parallel with the 
increased shrimp fisheries along the Middle America region where the shrimp catch has risen 
from ~1,600 metric tons in the 1960’s, to ~3,500 metric tons in 1995 to ~500 metric tons at 
present.  The recent reduction is not due to a reduced fishing effort but to overfishing of this 
resource. 
Guatemala was selected for the second MarWeB case study because of these conditions, and because of 
excellent personal relationships with key people at the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala, which 
Case Study 2:  Guatemala Section 4 
30 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
had developed during an earlier PICES MAFF-supported project on “Development of the prevention 
systems for harmful organisms’ expansion in the Pacific Rim” (2007–2012).  Similar to the case study in 
Indonesia, the Guatemala case study comprised a natural science component and a social science 
component.  It was conducted principally at the locations on the Pacific Coast of Guatemala shown in 
Figure 4.1. 
 
Fig. 4.1 Guatemala case study locations: Monterrico, Las Lisas, and La Barrona.  
The MarWeB case study team first visited their key contact people in Guatemala to discuss the objectives 
of the project and to introduce the idea of sato-umi.  During this visit, a poster was presented showing the 
integrated concept of sato-umi.  Visual aids were important because of the likelihood of language barriers.  
A translator (with a science background) was hired who understood and was able to communicate the 
project concepts effectively. 
The plan was to reproduce, as closely as possible, the efforts to develop a sato-umi approach in the 
Guatemala case study which was similar to that being developed in the Indonesia case study.  During the 
first visit, however, it was discovered that there are no endemic macroalgae (seaweeds) in Guatemala.  In 
addition, the large-scale shrimp culture practices in coastal Guatemala have been optimized to prevent 
disease and to produce the highest yields.  These high-intensity aquaculture operations are extremely 
susceptible to catastrophic loss of shrimp from disease and other factors, so operators are not voluntarily 
open to experimentation with co-culturing approaches that potentially could lessen downstream 
environmental impacts.  Therefore, the integrated multi-trophic aquaculture approach to implementing 
sato-umi that was being examined in Indonesia did not appear to be practical or appropriate for 
Guatemala.  However, discussions with university colleagues and local coastal residents suggested that 
we could explore other options for more sustainable fishing practices, for example through aquaculture 
and tourism development.  A questionnaire was sent to our point people about the fisheries supply chain, 
including exports, to determine which fisheries could be the focus of the project. 
 
 
 
Monterrico, Las Lisas, La Barrona 
Section 4 Case Study 2:  Guatemala 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 31 
The Guatemala contacts were able to identify and communicate with communities for which the project 
might be a good fit.  The project team and their Guatemala colleagues visited several coastal villages to 
discuss the MarWeB project goals.  An information sheet and poster on sato-umi was presented to 
introduce the concept.  Informal interviews were used to begin a community needs assessment (CNA), a 
systematic process for determining the needs and definable goals of a community.  CNAs are typically 
performed before major actions as part of a strategic planning process. 
Two contrasting communities were selected to participate in the project:  Las Lisas, a more isolated, with 
healthier ecosystem (enough fish in the ocean), and a healthier community (health center, education to the 
high school level, many community members attended college and returned to work in this community), 
and Monterrico, a community on the road system but with a degraded ecosystem (people fish in the 
estuaries with small size mesh, i.e., window screen, to catch every small fish; less fish in the ocean); local 
shrimp aquaculture benefits only a few, with products exported. 
These two communities represented extremes in community responses to the demise of the local fisheries.   
Community members from Las Lisas were enthusiastic for change that would allow for the return of the 
resources and the survival of their community.  In contrast, community members for Monterrico were 
very despondent about the future – declaring themselves as the “last fishermen on earth.”  A CNA was 
chosen to help understand the differences between these two communities with regard to their 
relationships to the sea.  Could a sato-umi approach make a meaningful impact on the triple bottom line: 
revitalization of sustainable fisheries, provision of ecologically manageable strategies and implementation, 
and creation of facilities with a demonstrable low environmental impact? 
4.2 Natural science studies 
The coastline of Guatemala has few locations, such as bays and inlets, which are protected from open 
ocean conditions.  As a consequence, there is little habitat which is suitable for high natural populations 
of bivalve molluscs or locations suitable for their cultivation.  This has meant that 90% of bivalve 
molluscs in Guatemala are imported from El Salvador, Mexico, Panama, Chile and USA.  However, 
several areas along Guatemala’s Pacific coast have environmental characteristics that could support the 
culture of bivalve molluscs.  Additionally, these areas are important locations for artisanal fishermen, 
although fishing resources can be highly variable.  The cultivation of oysters or other bivalves would 
allow extra income to the economy of these groups of people, who often live in poverty. 
The Center for Marine and Aquaculture (CEMA) at Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala has 
conducted culture studies with bivalve molluscs since 1998, mainly in the inner harbor of Puerto Quetzal, 
and reproduction studies in controlled laboratory settings in the experimental station at Monterrico.  
Previous studies have examined the use of longline systems, and assessed growth rates, materials, 
domestic markets and cultural practices.  The MarWeB case study examined how to adapt this longline 
technology for bivalve culture in the coastal lagoons of La Barrona.  The sources of freshwater here have 
low levels of contamination, and the depths of these coastal lagoons offer a suitable habitat for shellfish 
culture.  The intent was to work with the Integral Fisheries Cooperative Barrona RL to use this as a 
demonstration project which could be transferred to other coastal communities with similar water 
characteristics.  The specific objectives were to: 
 
Case Study 2:  Guatemala Section 4 
32 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
 Evaluate the performance of the longline system in La Barrona estuarine lagoons (e.g., Fig. 4.2); 
 Measure the productivity of bivalve molluscs (oysters) on the basis of their growth rates and time 
to reach market size; 
 Evaluate the survival rate in the different phases, and the main predators present; 
 Adapt or develop culture practices for the optimal management of the system by the Integral 
Fisheries Cooperative Barrona RL; 
 Perform microbiological studies of the product to ensure consumer food safety; 
 Assist with finding suitable markets for the sale of the final product by the Integral Fisheries 
Cooperative Barrona RL. 
 
Fig. 4.2 Example of a longline arrangement for culture of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. 
Unfortunately, despite strong support in the local community, this project struggled with problems of 
theft of the equipment and study organisms and was not able to achieve its goals.  However, the 
community did learn about the principals of oyster aquaculture and what would be required for successful 
growth of the bivalves if security conditions could be ensured.  The results obtained from the trial period 
demonstrated that culturing of C. gigas is feasible in Guatemala despite relatively low water recirculation 
rates and a high amount of suspended solids in the water column. C. gigas can achieve the commercial 
market size of 70 mm in diameter in six months, however the system must be cleaned every 15 days in 
order to maintain and/or improve these survival rates. 
4.3 Social science studies 
4.3.1 Methods 
Communities along the Pacific coast of Guatemala are true cultural entities.  While not historically part of 
the strongly traditional Quiché (Mayan) culture, movement between communities is limited and culturally 
restricted.  Community members who leave their communities are highly respected when they return, 
bringing new knowledge to the community.  The idea of a mobile community capable of changing with 
changing resources is not applicable here.  Overall, the situation in coastal Guatemala is that communities 
are seeking self-sufficiency in the wake of strongly declining fisheries potential and have no other agri-
economic or eco-tourism ventures. 
Section 4 Case Study 2:  Guatemala 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 33 
At the foundation of sato-umi (Yanagi, 2008) is the need for fishery-based communities to accept the 
costs of retooling their economies to allow for the costs of conservation to bring back both the resource 
and the cultural/community relationship.  Sato-umi is achieved by establishing local collective structures 
that enforce the community’s interest, and the availability of active conservation measures as options to 
contribute to biodiversity management through manual work in the ecosystem (Berque and Matsuda, 2013). 
The CNA, a process and protocol to gather information on the definable needs of a community (Altschuld 
and Kumar, 2010), was implemented for Las Lisas and Monterrico.  CNAs are performed prior to major 
actions as part of a strategic planning process and are fundamental to the development of coastal 
resources views (NOAA, no date).  CNAs are critical in “action-learning” projects where surveys and 
community mapping exercises are used. 
 
Fig. 4.3 Cartoon of interactions between healthy natural systems and healthy human systems, in coastal regions, 
used to facilitate interviews with families in Guatemala (FRA, Japan). 
Family interviews were conducted together with scientists and translators to get impressions of family 
relationships with the sea.  A visual aid (e.g., Fig. 4.3) was used to make sure the project concept was 
understood.  The interview questions included: 
1. Which thing in this poster is the most important of the sea to your family? 
2. Which is the biggest concern of your family? 
3. Does your community have to change or is it fine? 
Complementing the interview questions was a survey comprised of 34 questions with clickable answers.  
The questions in general fell into four categories: (1) questions that introduced the process so that the 
families could familiarize themselves with the clicker system and diminish any anxiety associated with 
Case Study 2:  Guatemala Section 4 
34 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
the survey itself; (2) questions that helped delineate the demographics of the responder; (3) questions that 
explored the demand and accessibility of fish/protein supply; and (4) questions that examined the 
willingness of respondents to change their relationship with the resources of the sea.  This survey was 
conducted using a computer, projector, and real-time electronic “clickers” which the family could use to 
input their response, with the results immediately being integrated and presented on the screen, 
anonymously for the entire room (see the MarWeB database
4
 for all questions and responses for Las 
Lisas and Monterrico).  Prior to the survey, the project team told that community members would be 
reluctant to share their thoughts with strangers, so it was decided to use the clickers to allow for 
anonymity of responses.  This allowed the team to conduct CNA in more detail.  The team spent a day 
with the community members and surveyed about 20 families. 
4.3.2 Results 
The data from the clicker surveys was analyzed by the project team.  Summaries of the CNA were provided 
to Las Lisas and Monterrico communities as oral presentations, a booklet with photos and comments, and 
a comprehensive report.  The latter included a full synthesis of the survey results, conclusions of the CNA 
and recommendations. 
Demographics 
For comparison, the responses were split into the two communities, plus a sub-group of fishermen from 
Monterrico.  The Monterrico fishermen had the largest families (i.e., supporting greater than seven 
individuals), with multigenerational fishermen within each family.  On average there were more than four 
children per family.  In contrast the traditional (non-fishermen) family in Monterrico was smaller (5–6 
people), with fewer children (3–4).  The families of Las Lisas were the smallest (5 or less), with two 
children. 
Protein needs 
Protein for Las Lisas’s families came primarily from finfish from the market.  The use of fish in the diet 
was variable, with most families restricting fish meals to one to two meals per month.  This was 
surprising, given that this is an isolated fishing community.  The Monterrico community was further 
removed from fresh seafood as the source of protein.  About 50% of the fish consumed came from 
processed (frozen, non-local fish or canned) fish.  They had a higher frequency of fish meals per month 
compared with Las Lisas communities. 
Association with fisheries 
As an extension of the real loss of natural fisheries, the two communities accepted that aquaculture-grown 
fish is required to maintain their community.  It was not so much that aquaculture fish would improve the 
family diet (nutrition) but that aquaculture would improve the economics of the community and, as a 
result, the quality of life for families.  All responders (other than a separate group of fisherman) 
recognized that their community is moving away from the sea and needs to create land-based livelihoods.

Section 4 Case Study 2:  Guatemala 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 35 
Not surprisingly, the individuals self-designated as fishermen caught fish for the market only, relying on 
other family members to obtain fish for family use.  All families regardless of location believed that the 
availability of fish had declined over the last decade and that the quality of the fish caught locally had 
diminished, often using the term “contaminated”.  They had no confidence that their community would 
survive in their current association with natural fisheries. 
Association with alternative fisheries 
In regard to the real loss of natural fisheries, Las Lisas and Moterrico accepted that aquaculture-grown 
fish is required to maintain their communities.  It was less that aquaculture would improve their family 
diet but that it would improve the economics of the community and, as a result, the quality of life for 
families.  All responders, except the separate group of fishermen responders, recognized that the 
community is moving away from the sea and needs to create an on-land livelihood.  This response is in 
contrast to the positive feelings towards the sea – perhaps an acceptance that the sea defines their 
location, transport, and history – but is no longer a reliable provider.  All recognized that meal and protein 
alternatives that did not originate from their shores are readily available.  The path to a new economy was 
less clear.  Most agree that there is a need for better education.  Fishermen clearly stated that more 
education is needed.  This could be interpreted two ways – that with the increased investment of time to 
harvest fish resources for survival, young fishermen must reduce their education substantially, or that 
education towards improved fisheries or fisheries management is desired.  In contrast to the perceived 
needs of the families, respondents did not consider a community with increased aquaculture opportunities. 
The perception from the survey is that the three responding groups were at different stages of loss with 
regard to natural fisheries.  Monterrico have moved furthest from a natural fisheries community.  Their 
dependence is no longer on fisheries but other economic activities.  This is also the community that has 
exploited the marine resource the furthest – from the loss of pelagic finfish to the loss of net-able 
resources in the coastal lagoons.  They are now netting the coastal rivers and lagoons with window 
screening for subsistence protein.  All indications are that the Monterrico community can no longer rely 
on their waters for their livelihood.  They are also the community most open to whatever new livelihood 
is available, i.e., aquaculture, land-crops, and tourism. 
Las Lisas community members still had a strong reliance on the natural marine resources but are open to 
transportable foods.  This community is more isolated from other economic activities and somewhat 
geographically separated on a coastal peninsula.  The responders looked to the natural sea resources for 
the future, but had an equally strong desire to add land-based aquaculture facilities to their economic 
foundation.  Las Lisas is the community that is in an early stage leading toward the path of lost fisheries – 
there is a strong sense of loss and insufficient replacement, yet improvements in natural fisheries or 
improved access to natural fisheries (piers, boat access, etc.) are the focus of their future vision.  They are 
optimistic about their community and have a strong desire to increase the “value added” fisheries access 
by exploring the recreational or eco-tourism markets. 
A synthesis of this assessment includes the following: 
 Seafood, in particular pelagic finfish and shrimp, is an important component of local diets, and 
“fishing” is a culturally-determining part of the community; 
 Nevertheless, many respondents in these communities expressed a desire to move away from 
such high dependence on the sea; 
Case Study 2:  Guatemala Section 4 
36 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
 A healthier lifestyle can be facilitated with opportunities for better education; sustainable, 
environmentally-friendly tourism; and environmentally-considerate aquaculture opportunities; 
 Protection of the lagoon waters is essential, as these waters are breeding grounds for many major 
economically valuable species; 
 Community-wide, coordinated eco-tourism and fishing trips for tourists could be implemented to 
create a more sustainable alternative to fishing for sustenance; 
 An alternative source of fish-based food supplies must be sought, such as through aquaculture; 
 The communities have a relationship with the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala and 
should work with the faculty and researchers to develop sustainable associations.   
Through the survey and conversations it was clear that these two communities are at different stages along 
the path of “development”.  Monterrico has been in a resource-starved existence for some time and is 
prepared for community development that does not include natural marine resources.  Community food 
choices are a concern for the community members.  Here, logical alternatives would be aquaculture.  The 
community vision is firmly directed to shrimp mariculture – a common vision for communities in this 
region.  With many other Guatamala communities benefitting from shrimp mariculture, it is hard not to 
want to follow a similar path. 
However, shrimp mariculture is a firmly established enterprise in this region of Guatemala.  Companies 
such as Acuamaya are highly visible and highly successful.  They have a strong presence in the economic 
development in the region.  They also have a program to assist individuals or communities in developing 
the shrimp industry – but under their terms.  For reasons that are both economically advantageous to 
Acuamaya and critical for the industry to prosper, Acuamaya will assist if the community follows their 
strict guidelines (financing, seed stock, rearing timeline, treatment for infectious agents, etc.).  High-
intensity shrimp aquaculture operations in Guatemala do not lend themselves to multi-trophic operations.  
For example, there is no interest in secondary treatment of wastewater from shrimp ponds since:  (1) the 
wastewater is high volume/high flow and cannot be held for a sufficient period of time to process; (2) any 
after pond retention is seen as a reservoir of infectious agents, placing the crop at risk; and (3) the “ocean 
is right there” to serve as a suitable dilution opportunity.  In addition, shrimp farming is a large operation 
with a small economic footprint.  It is not a community-intensive activity – it is easily run by a small 
number of individuals, and the product is shipped elsewhere immediately without any community 
processing. 
Given the present successful shrimp aquaculture operations by these companies, the MarWeB project was 
unable to make any significant input to this industry.  However, a sato-umi approach could contribute in 
the development of alternatives to shrimp farms.  It is uncertain why previous ventures into tilapia 
aquaculture were not maintained, but given the extensive nature of the industry, it is likely that the 
possibility of an economic success is marginal.  Novel alternatives must be sought.  While aquaculture 
may be the future for Monterrico, other alternatives seem appropriate for Las Lisas.  Here the natural 
fisheries are not as depleted as in Monterrico, and economic activities that can involve the fisherman’s 
skills combined with lower pressure on the natural fisheries community should be considered.  Expansion 
of recreational fisheries or eco-tourism would enable the use of the present fishing fleet and community 
skill set, while allowing the natural fisheries communities to recover.  La Lisas is poised to increased 
education in resource management and development.  However, this is an uphill battle as the community 
is very isolated, lacks facilities for visitors who would participate in the recreational / eco-tourism 
Section 4 Case Study 2:  Guatemala 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 37 
activities.  The community of Las Lisas is still strongly connected to the sea and philosophically poised to 
alter their world as long as their natural resources are not fully exploited. 
Implementation of sato-umi in Guatemala will depend upon the building of trust and relationships with 
the local people, and with shifting the focus from fishing to tourism and other activities.  Fishermen and 
women suggested that the next generation of fishermen should be fewer and better educated in sustainable 
business practices.  Community leaders were encouraged to use the MarWeB project report as a tool to 
help secure funding for future eco-friendly development, while carefully considering which opportunities 
best promoted both community economic and ecosystem health. 
As a result of the CNA, Las Lisas and Monterrico were provided with access to experts in tourism and 
encouraged to establish a side project on community aquaculture.  This MarWeB project partnership was 
able to open avenues of collaboration among the local communities on the coast, the military, and the 
University research community.  The project also facilitated communications with leaders of a United 
Nations Development Program (UNDP) project which is intended to support and expand the five Marine 
Protected Areas (MPAs) on the Pacific coast of Guatemala. 
4.4 Establishment of marine protected areas in Guatemala 
Through the interactions and connections with key contacts in Guatemala, the MarWeB project team was 
contacted by UNDP to assist with developing the conditions to establish MPAs along the Pacific coast of 
Guatemala.  This activity included co-support of a multi-day workshop titled “Exchange of experiences 
for conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in protected areas on the marine coast”, which 
included the participation of university faculty and students and representatives of government ministries.  
The participants conducted fieldwork with local fishermen to learn about inshore and estuarine fishing 
operations, the management and challenges associated with finfish and marine products and distribution, 
and analysis of problems with fishing gear in the multipurpose Natural Reserve of Monterrico.  They also 
attended a series of interactive sessions on coastal marine issues associated with climate change. 
The overall findings and recommendations by the MarWeB project team in regard to elements critical to 
the establishment of successful MPAs included: 
1.  Student input:  The collaboration of students of from Universidad del Valle (University of the 
Valley) and Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala (University of San Carlos) with UN project 
investigators benefits both the UN project and the students.  By keeping the students informed of the 
current issues and challenges (both legal and scientific) of the project, they can help brainstorm and 
implement solutions to existing and potential problems.  In particular, the students were interested in 
establishing the proper balance between enforcement of fishing rules for fishermen and education of 
the citizens (both fishermen and non-fishermen alike).  This is especially important because of the 
high rate of illiteracy in coastal Guatemala – enforcement without education is unfair and 
unproductive and contributes to social injustice for the impacted citizens in a very challenging 
economic region of Guatemala. 
2.  Empowerment of locals:  The students developed strategic solutions to a series of fisheries problems 
in coastal Guatemala (e.g., preventing the use of illegal fishing nets in estuaries).  The solutions 
included providing outreach to entire family groups, not just male fishermen.  The inclusion of men, 
women, and children in the decision-making process, allowing them to benefit in the outcome, is 
Case Study 2:  Guatemala Section 4 
38 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
important to ensure successful recruitment of a wide spectrum of community members as coastal 
stewards.  The “stickers and clickers” approach (using anonymous surveys combined with interesting 
activities for the children) introduced by the MarWeB project team, will be continued in the future by 
university faculty and students participating in the UN project. 
3.  Incentives:  The sea turtle project is an example of successful conservation in coastal Guatemala.  By 
encouraging harvesters to provide 20% of the harvested eggs for conservation, there has been a 
substantial rebound in turtle populations.  This incentive is also supported by enforcement as there is 
a fine for those who violate the 20% return policy.  This strategy could be used as a model for other 
conservation programs yet to be established, such as exchanging illegal “window screen” type nets 
for legal ones of a defined and ecologically sustainable mesh size.  Those adopting legal nets would 
be presented with a fishing license, upon demonstrating an understanding of the fishing regulations, 
while emphasizing to the entire family that they had now joined the realm of coastal stewards (as 
suggested by a student group during their discussions). 
4. Sustainability:  There has been little discussion in country about how the MPAs in Guatemala will 
be maintained after the UN project funding ends.  The MarWeB project team recommended Guatemala 
to consider developing partnerships with international experts of the Natural Capital Project and 
NOAA’s International Marine Protected Area Capacity Building Team to develop a plan for 
sustaining the MPAs into the future. 
5.  Partnerships:  Establishing strong partnerships with all the environmental agencies involved in 
sustaining coastal resources, and protecting the Guatemalan coastal, estuarine and nearshore waters is 
important.  It is essential that all parties responsible for the creation and management of the MPAs 
have an active role in the development of these areas, and that they continue to be invited to participate 
in future meetings. 
6.  Training of the next generation:  The students are starved for advanced training in subjects such as 
stock assessment, integrated ecosystem assessment, and general oceanography (in particular chemical 
and biological) and marine biology.  Much of their current training is focused on the very practical 
aspects of establishing and maintaining aquaculture operations.  Future opportunities should be 
sought to bring in international experts to provide training in fisheries, ecosystem science, and the 
challenges facing people and coastal organisms due to climate change.  It will be important to provide 
a translator for locals who want to listen and learn from the lecturers, but do not speak English.  A 
rewarding observation was that two of the leaders of this workshop had participated in previous 
trainings and workshops sponsored by PICES under the Seafood Safety Program as students at the 
Universidad de San Carlos.  Currently, one of them oversees Fisheries Resources Regulation, Control 
and Enforcement on both coasts of Guatemala and another was the professor for the oceanography 
class from the Universidad de San Carlos.  Both individuals were able to put their prior PICES 
experience to good use in Guatemala. 
7.  Perceptions of fish and establishment of a supply chain:  The supply chain for fish transport to 
Guatemala City is poorly developed because it is difficult to get fresh fish to it and other cities in 
Guatemala.  In part, this is due to the lack of education about the nutritional value of fish as a 
valuable source of protein and essential fatty acids (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids).  Guatemala’s public 
residing distant from the coast have the general perception that “fish are smelly, toxic and taboo”, 
which leads to relatively little domestic consumption and export of much of their fish and shrimp 
Section 4 Case Study 2:  Guatemala 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 39 
products to other countries, with the result that “Guatemala is exporting health.”  The importance of 
“eat at home aquaculture” was stressed as a key to future healthy populations of citizens. 
8.  Tourism:  The importance of tourism education and responsible commercialization of fisheries 
cannot be understated.  There are many examples in Guatemala of successful implementation of 
sustainable tourism efforts as an alternative to non-sustainable fishing.  For example, the sailfish 
tourist fishery nets $6,000 per tourist per day, whereas the economic value of harvesting and local 
selling of sailfish is two orders of magnitude less profitable, as a single sailfish sells for only 
approximately $75 per fish.  The fisheries enforcement groups are attempting to educate coastal 
communities about the importance of sailfish as a catch-and-release fishery to sustain this profitable 
and sustainable tourist fishery.  Large fines and jail time are the consequence of illegal sailfish capture, 
processing (e.g., smoking) and domestic sales, and relatively sophisticated and modern methods (e.g., 
aerial drones) are used to find illegal sailfish smoking operations and help enforce existing regulations. 
4.5 Conclusions 
Three needs for the future were identified by the Las Lisas  and Monterrico communities: 
1  An economy based on tourism; 
2. Aquaculture (especially with shrimp) for improving the economy and family nutrition; 
3. Education, especially with respect to sustainable fisheries and harmony with the sea (e.g., see Fig. 4.3). 
In addition, key factors for a successful project in developing nations such as Guatemala include:  
 Careful selection of a country that fits the project objectives; 
 Establishment of regular communication with effective “point people” in the country of choice;  
regular communication via Skype (preferred), phone (second choice) or email (last choice) is 
essential; 
 Translation of words and concepts into the language spoken in the country of choice; 
 An initial visit to the country to determine whether project objectives match the in-country needs, 
e.g., whether the “fit” is good; 
 Use of questionnaires and in-person interviews with the point people and their collaborators to 
determine which fisheries and communities could be the subject of the project; 
 A second visit to the communities to assess their interest in participating in the project; 
 Careful analysis of how the communities needs assessments (CAN) should be performed (e.g., 
via interview, clicker surveys, other types of surveys); 
 Analysis of the CNA, followed by appropriate actions.  In the Guatemala case study, this 
included a booklet with pictures of our work with the community and general concepts of sato-
umi, a summary document and a formal presentation of results to the participating families; 
 Follow-up actions, including establishment of local aquaculture and tourism potential in the two 
communities.

5.1 Background 
The Republic of Palau (Fig. 5.1) was selected as the potential third case study for the MarWeB project.  It 
was chosen because of its finfish capture fishery focus, and because of its existing networks of 
community-based fisheries.  A country profile of Palau constructed by the UN’s Food and Agriculture 
Organisation is available at http://www.fao.org/fi/oldsite/FCP/en/PLW/profile.htm.  A preliminary 
‘scouting trip’ was conducted by Ms. Kimuko Suzuki of the Japan Wildlife Research Center in November 
2015 to assess the suitability of Palau as a case study and to identify potential key contacts. 
As of November 2015, the marine fishery of Palau was categorized into six types: coastal commercial, 
coastal subsistence, offshore locally-based, offshore foreign-based, freshwater, and aquaculture.  The 
offshore foreign-based fishery was dominated by foreign fishing vessels mainly exporting tuna and bonito 
from Palau.  The main catch in coastal areas was reef fish such as groupers, snappers, etc., which was 
used mostly for domestic consumption.  Fish consumption is decreasing gradually in Palau.  However, 
compared to other small island states in the Pacific region, such as Samoa or the Solomon Islands, the 
consumption of fish in Palau is relatively high.  According to the 2013 Statistical Report published by the 
government of Palau, the share of fishing was 3.3% of GDP (at current prices).  This was down slightly 
from 3.7% in 2007. 
In the human social system, fresh fish are landed and distributed to fish markets and local communities.  
Sixteen fish markets were operated by fishing associations under the Palau Federation of Fishing 
Associations (PFFA).  However, most commercial fishing associations have ceased operations currently, 
and the number of fish markets is decreasing.  Newly opened hotels and restaurants are trying to get fresh 
fish directly from local fishermen.  As a result, the distribution system through fish markets is not 
functioning.

5.2 Environmental conservation policy 
5.2.1 National level 
In 2003, the Protected Area Network (PAN) Act was adopted to enable the national government to be 
involved in, and to enhance the efficiency of, protected areas by networking regional activities (e.g., 
Sasakawa Peace Foundation, 2013).  This Act defines that the national government should provide 
technical assistance and develop methods to facilitate effective management of protected areas in the 
region.  The Bureau of PAN, PAN Management Committee, and its Technical Committee were 
established by the Revised PAN Act in 2008 to expedite this network.  At the same time, a Green Fee was 
introduced as a sustainable financial resource. 
Section 5 Case Study 3:  Palau 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 43 
However, Palau’s fishing stocks, including tuna, continued to decline due to foreign-based fisheries.  In 
addition, foreign fishing vessels have negative impacts on Palau’s water quality because of waste 
discharge.  As a consequence, and consistent with traditional fishing practices in Palau, the Palau 
National Marine Sanctuary Act was approved in October 2015 to protect the natural resources and marine 
environment of the country.  This Act designates 80% of Palau’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) as a 
fully protected marine reserve in which extractive activities, such as fishing or mining, are prohibited  
(Fig. 5.2).  Slightly larger than the state of California, this sanctuary is the sixth-largest fully protected 
marine area in the world (Pew Charitable Trust, 2015).  Implementation of the marine sanctuary will take 
place over a 5-year period, and the number of foreign vessels fishing in these waters will be decreased 
annually.  The remaining 20% of the EEZ, mostly in the nation’s coastal waters 12 nautical miles around 
each of its 250 islands, is being set aside as a Domestic Fishing Zone reserved for local fishermen, and 
small-scale fisheries are allowed only for domestic markets.  The zone is designated to ensure food 
security in Palau and fish supply for tourists.  Monitoring of illegal fishing is a challenge to be addressed.  
Previously, poaching was monitored by fishing vessels operating in Palau’s EEZ, but the monitoring by 
fishermen cannot be expected once fishing activities are prohibited.  Poaching may in fact increase.  As a 
result of this Act, the country is expected to lose 5 to 10 million dollars of fishing rights annually from 
foreign vessels.  Palau is actively working to secure funding to strengthen its monitoring systems.

5.2.2 State level 
Politically, Palau consists of 16 states which are vested with inshore fishery management responsibilities, 
and a national government with offshore responsibilities.  Koror state sets strict regulations for visiting in 
its Rock Islands Southern Lagoon (RISL) located in the south of Koror.  RISL is a World Heritage Site 
and is the most popular tourist site in Palau. 
Koror state collects $50 from visitors as an entry fee which is used to strengthen monitoring in the RISL 
area.  There are seven protected areas in the RISL, and all of them are no-take.  In the process of 
designation of no-take areas, the state government met with local fishermen and sought their cooperation.  
Currently, local fishermen belong to the advisory team of the Koror Pride Campaign, which is conducted 
by the state government to enhance conservation of its marine ecosystems. 
5.3 Conclusions 
Designation of the National Marine Sanctuary by Palau could have negative impacts not only on the 
foreign-based fisheries but also on the domestic market.  The bycatch of swordfish and mahi mahi, which 
has represented 20% of the catch, is consumed locally.  By restricting the fisheries in the EEZ, this 
bycatch cannot be distributed in local markets.  Local fishermen are allowed to fish in the Domestic 
Fishing Zone.  However, a stable supply of fish from local fishermen is improbable because they do not 
fish regularly.  Consequently, the volume of fish used for local consumption is likely to decrease.  In 
addition, the expected growth in tourism may increase damage to natural resources in Palau’s marine 
environment.  For example, in Koror state the size of coastal fish appearing in local markets is decreasing, 
possibly because the growth in demand with increasing tourism encourages overfishing.  Fish feeding by 
tourists may also have negative impacts on marine ecosystems in the coastal area.  At the same time that 
the government of Palau has designated 80% of the EEZ as a marine reserve to protect marine ecosystems 
of the country, it is also promoting the tourism industry as a sustainable use of natural resources.  However, 
negative impacts on marine ecosystems from tourism activites may still occur in spite of conservation 
efforts carried out by the government. 
In conclusion, disseminating the sato-umi concept is not appropriate in Palau because the current marine 
policy of this country is leading to the exclusion of fishing industries.  As a consequence, the MarWeB 
project did not develop Palau as a third case study.

A principal goal of the MarWeB project was to understand marine social-ecological systems, and to 
explore the concepts of sato-umi, in developing countries of the Pacific.  The two case studies,  
(1) development of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) and its potential social benefits relating 
to shrimp aquaculture in Indonesia, and (2) the investigation of aquaculture and local community needs to 
increase human well-being in Pacific coastal communities of Guatemala, provide contrasting examples.  
Our initial plan was to initiate comparable projects in both locations, broadly relating to the development 
of IMTA as a means to increase marine food variety and mitigate deleterious environmental impacts, and 
to study their social benefits.  While we did follow similar approaches in both case studies, the details 
were considerably different between the case studies.  This was because of the different circumstances of 
each case study and the interests of the communities involved, underlining the importance of having key 
contacts and conducting community needs assessments and/or commodity chain mapping in each 
location.  Table 6.1 provides a summary comparison of the key features of the Indonesia and Guatemala 
case studies. 
Both case studies represented combinations of research questions and interventions, situated within a 
coupled marine social-ecological systems conceptual framework.  It is clear that the relationships of 
marine ecosystem health and human well-being are place-dependent, and it was therefore crucial to 
identify the local perceptions of the specific problems in each place.  In Indonesia, these problems were 
well-defined and well-known by all stakeholders, from local shrimp pond operators to government 
agencies.  Over the past 30 years, Karawang Regency in this country has experienced the destruction of 
mangroves to build intensive brackishwater shrimp ponds, followed by the collapse of these ponds and 
their shrimp culture activities due to disease, followed by abandonment of the ponds and loss of dike 
maintenance, leading ultimately to the erosion of the shoreline up to 3 km inland in several locations.  In 
addition, for those ponds that continue to operate, effluent waters released into the coastal ocean are very 
high in nutrients, risking eutrophication.  These issues likely will intensify because the Indonesian 
government wishes to increase national aquaculture production several-fold over the next few years.  
Such a well-defined and widely recognized problem leads to support by the government and the 
willingness of stakeholders to consider a more integrated approach which, if successful, would resolve 
problems of excessive nutrient inputs into the coastal ocean, increase the variety of seafood produced by 
the ponds and available to local markets, and (importantly) have no negative impacts on the core 
production of shrimp.  Stakeholders were receptive to a “discovery-based” approach to their problems, 
and were willing to consider sato-umi.  It was also helpful that one of the key contacts had previous 
knowledge and experience of sato-umi from other projects with Japan.

In contrast, shrimp culture in Guatemala is conducted by national or international companies for export 
markets.  Their processes are highly controlled, generally with few direct benefits to local communities.  
These companies followed a risk-averse strategy and were reluctant to consider any changes, such as 
IMTA, to their operations.  The approach in the Guatemala case study was, therefore, to focus on interacting 
with local communities to understand their perceptions of their needs, and to work with academic 
researchers to develop alternative aquaculture options.  This resulted in a stronger emphasis being placed 
on the social science and local community studies.  In addition, the communities in the Guatemala study 
can be considered less economically-developed than the communities studied in Indonesia. 
These differences in “initial conditions” also led to differences in who “sees” the presence of social 
and/or ecological problems, and therefore the need for solutions.  This can be summarized by considering 
who are the drivers of change in these systems.  For example, is it the local community such as in 
Guatemala (“bottom-up”), or the government, such as in Indonesia (“top-down”).  In Guatemala, the large 
shrimp industry “sees” no problems, and therefore is reluctant to change existing processes of intensive 
shrimp culture.  The community need is to put food on the table on a daily basis.  The motivation in 
Guatemala is closer to “subsistence”.  In Indonesia, the government “sees” the problems of declining 
shrimp production and environmental degradation, and wants development and change.  The government 
Section 6 Case Study Comparison 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 47 
is interested in enabling people to “put food on their tables”, but also to improve environmental quality.  
The motivation in Indonesia is closer to achieving a “sustainable environment” and food supply system. 
Human well-being may also be perceived differently in different circumstances, and with different 
expectations, both within (e.g., between the communities of Las Lisas and Monterrico) and across 
countries (e.g., among the different PICES member countries as demonstrated by the well-being analyses 
in Section 2).  It is worth considering where, and how, well-being can be achieved.  In our psychological 
study in Indonesia of how people relate to the sea (Fig. 3.3), it is clear that safe seafood and the protection 
of the land and coastline will improve the psychological sense of “Stability”.  More jobs and wealth 
created by IMTA through expansion of the commodity chain will improve the sense of a “Beneficial” 
relationship with the sea.  A wider variety of products from IMTA and better water quality will improve 
the “Aesthetic” sense.  Therefore, introduction of IMTA will strengthen people’s “Ability to change” and 
improve the social-ecological systems of Karawang, Indonesia.  In the Guatemala study, based on the 
community needs assessments, there are opportunities for the local community to introduce marine 
protected areas, eco-tourism, and oyster longline aquaculture technologies. 
These two case studies represent different social situations.  For example, the practice of “markets” differs 
between Monterrico, Guatemala, and Karawang, Indonesia.  In the former, markets are very local, e.g., 
using small stalls, whereas in the latter markets are larger and more diverse.  However, both studies 
benefitted from analyses of the human social dynamics in regard to their relationships with the sea, and 
the problems as they conceptualized them.  The larger community of Karawang (in 2010, the population 
of Karawang City was about 250,000 and the population of the Karawang Regency was about  
2.2 million) and the well-developed seafood market systems made the use of the commodity chain 
approach more appropriate for this region.  In contrast, the appropriate method for the much smaller and 
isolated coastal communities in Guatemala, consisting of a few hundred families, was the more direct 
community needs assessment.  In Guatemala, this approach was also enhanced by the use of the 
electronic vote-based (“clicker”) survey system which provided participants with immediate feedback of 
the results of each question and was used to engage participants in deeper conversations on the issues 
raised by the surveys.

7.1 Overview 
Understanding social-ecological dynamics in marine systems, and how to promote it in developing 
countries, is a very large and complicated topic.  Activities need to range from large-scale country 
overviews and comparisons, to regional and community-scale case studies.  Each spatial scale is 
important, and each spatial scale is necessary to obtain a broader cross-scale understanding of how people 
relate to the sea and how marine ecosystem health influences human well-being (e.g., Charles, 2001; 
Perry and Ommer, 2003). 
The MarWeB project used studies which included a wide range of spatial scales, from comparisons 
among PICES member countries (and Indonesia) with respect to how people view their relationships with 
the sea, to understanding social-ecological dynamics at a regional scale in Indonesia, to comparisons of 
these dynamics among isolated coastal communities in Guatemala.  The country-level comparisons found 
common attributes in the relationships, such as “Security” and “Basic material for a good life” functioning 
as fundamental variables, and “Freedom of choice and action” as a dependent variable.  People in PICES 
member countries are generally satisfied and have higher expectations of the future, regardless of their 
ecological condition, economic situation, and culture.  In contrast, satisfaction and expectation levels for 
“Identification”, “Collection”, and “Competition” were statistically low in all six member countries.  This 
may reflect higher uncertainty about the future of marine social and ecological systems. 
This analysis also found differences among nations.  For example, among the East Asian nations studied 
here, “Good social relationships” strongly influence “Freedom of choice and action” as the most 
important component in Japan and Korea, whereas “Health” does in Indonesia (Hori and Makino, 2016).  
Understanding the differences among countries is an important first step towards building a consensus for 
larger-scale marine conservation activities.  This is also important information for domestic policy 
makers, to allocate the limited human and financial resources for ecosystem conservation activities in 
order to efficiently maximize well-being of their people.  For example, in Indonesia, our study found that 
safe seafood and the protection of the land and coastline will improve the psychological sense of 
“Stability”.  More jobs and wealth created by IMTA through expansion of the commodity chain will 
improve the sense of a “Beneficial” relationship with the sea.  A wider variety of products from IMTA 
and better water quality will improve the “Aesthetic” sense.  These results can provide justification for, in 
our study, the introduction of IMTA that might improve the social-ecological systems of Karawang, 
Indonesia. 
Summary Section 7 
50 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
7.2 Lessons learned 
One of the first, and strongest, lessons learned from these studies is the importance of connecting with 
organizations in each country which could facilitate and advance the project.  This organization and the 
key people are needed to understand the concept of sato-umi or marine social-ecological systems, and to 
translate it into the local context.  In Indonesia, the Agency for the Assessment and Application of 
Technology (BPPT) in Jakarta, and the National Center for Brackishwater Aquaculture (NCBA) in 
Karawang, were ideal partners.  Members of BPPT were familiar with the concepts of sato-umi during 
previous experience with Japanese researchers in other projects.  To identify our second case study, we 
relied on the experience of the previous PICES – Japan MAFF project on “Development of the prevention 
systems for harmful organisms’ expansion in the Pacific Rim” (2007–2012).  The process they followed 
to identify case study countries was to contact colleagues from the Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission (IOC) of UNESCO who had previous experience working on science projects in developing 
nations.  These colleagues recommended contacting the IOC point people in the Central American and 
Southeast Asian countries that were the best fits for this project.  These key contacts in each country then 
helped to: (1) define specific objectives and stakeholders, (2) identify how best to assess needs, (3) 
conduct needs assessments in the most promising target countries, (4) tailor the training to the needs of 
the country, and (5) find ways to sustain new capacities.  For the MarWeB project, a questionnaire was 
sent to the IOC point people in each country in Central America and Southeast Asia that best fit the 
MarWeB project goals.  Guatemala was ultimately selected because it met the criteria for the MarWeB 
project goals and because we had established a relationship with the Center for Marine and Aquaculture 
(CEMA) at the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala in the previous PICES – Japan MAFF project.  
This resulted in identification of needs, facilitating the best country match and establishing contact with a 
responsive point person who was committed to the scientific goals of the project. 
Other key lessons include:  
 The need, and time, to build relationships and trust, both with the project leaders and key country 
contacts, but also with the people of the communities participating in the project; 
 Persistence; 
 Feedback of results – this includes not only feedback of the overall results of the project, often 
through in-person presentations and visits, but also immediate feedback to surveys, for example 
the “clicker” surveys which allow anonymity, and can be used to help overcome language and 
cultural barriers.  However, it is very important to carefully develop the questions to be posed to 
the community; 
 Building capacity among local researchers and the communities participating in the project; 
 Successful research partnerships, for example, with key contact organizations; 
 Developing an understanding of how these activities can help the local contacts, i.e., their personal 
motivations for participating in this research; 
 Collaboration and collaborative decision-making among the project leaders, key contacts, and 
participating communities is essential for decision making; 
 Open mindedness and listening are critical skills to employ; 
 The lack of capacity (in terms of financial and technical expertise and resources) will constrain 
what can be done; for example, for some of the IMTA studies it was hoped to conduct complex 
social-ecological systems modelling, but the capacity for such studies was not available within 
the time frame of this project. 
Section 7 Summary 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 51 
The use of the appropriate methodology to assess community needs is essential.  The results from such 
analyses can then be used to select and develop how to address these needs (or which needs).  For 
example, the decision to focus on aquaculture as a primary underlying issue in both case studies was 
driven not only by an understanding of the local problems described by the key contacts, but also by 
interest from the local communities (as determined from the needs assessments).  Community leadership 
and attentiveness to interests and directions from the community are positives in this approach, but may 
make comparisons among case studies difficult.  In this project, for example, both the Indonesia and 
Guatemala case studies were begun with ideas of focusing on IMTA and community support, but each 
evolved in different ways due to community interests and opportunities (or constraints on initial expected 
opportunities).  The problems of implementing oyster aquaculture in coastal Guatemala, including theft 
and vandalism of the equipment, also illustrates the importance of local situations and difficulties in 
implementing new techniques, despite the strong interest and commitment of local communities. 
7.3 PICES Advisory Report  
A shorter, “plain language” version of the main approaches and findings from this project is available as 
the PICES Advisory Report on “Improving aquaculture, marine ecosystems and human well-being:  A 
social-ecological systems approach” on the PICES website at http://www.pices.int/publications/brochures. 
7.4 Database 
Data collected during the project are available on the PICES website at http://www.pices.int/projects/marweb.  
This database includes: (1) raw data for the comparative well-being analysis in PICES member countries 
(see Section 2 in this report); (2) data from the 2014–2016 aguaculture pond experiments in Indonesia 
(see Section 3); (3) electronic “clicker” survey data for the community needs assessments in Guatemala 
(see Section 4), and bibliography on the key concepts used in this project, such as social-ecological 
systems, human well-being and sato-umi. 
7.5 Conclusions 
In response to the two key questions posed at the outset of this project (Section 1.2) we offer the 
following conclusions.  
(a) How do marine ecosystems support human well-being? 
The “traditional” biophysical science approach to this question is often framed in terms of food supply 
and livelihoods.  However, this narrow framing leaves out the very important psychological needs of how 
people relate to the sea, for example as described in Section 2.  In reality, both the physical and 
psychological needs are required for positive human well-being. 
(b) How do human communities support sustainable and productive marine ecosystems? 
This is the reciprocal question to that above.  It is perhaps a more social science-centered view, with the 
focus on people and what they do, or can do, to ensure or improve healthy marine ecosystems.  The 
actions of people can be detrimental or beneficial to marine ecosystems.  These actions become all the 
Summary Section 7 
52 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
more important to consider when biophysical marine ecosystems are already under stress, for example 
from a changing climate.  This concept of what people can do to cultivate healthy marine ecosystems is at 
the core of the Japanese concept of sato-umi.

1. BACKGROUND 
In December 2011, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan, through the 
Fisheries Agency of Japan (JFA), approved funding for a 5-year PICES project on “Marine Ecosystem 
Health and Human Well-Being”.  The project began in April 2012, and is expected to be completed by 
March 31, 2017.  Its goal is to identify the relationships between sustainable human communities and 
productive marine ecosystems in the North Pacific, under the concept of fishery social-ecological systems 
(known in Japan as the “Sato-umi” fisheries management system).  It recognizes that global changes are 
affecting both climate and human social and economic conditions.  Key questions of the project are: a) 
how do marine ecosystems support human well-being? and b) how do human communities support 
sustainable and productive marine ecosystems?  The project is also intended to foster partnerships with 
non-PICES member countries and related international programs and organizations.  This contribution is 
from the Official Development Assistance (ODA) Fund and therefore, involvement of developing Pacific 
Rim countries in activities is required under this project. 
The following organizational principles, agreed upon by MAFF/JFA and PICES, apply to the project 
(Project Principle 3): 
 The Project is expected to have strong connections and interactions with, and involve and support the 
relevant activities of, the PICES FUTURE (Forecasting and Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and 
Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems) program (Research Theme 3 on “How do human 
activities affect coastal ecosystems and how are societies affected by changes in these ecosystems?”) 
and PICES expert groups such as Section on Human Dimensions of Marine Systems (S-HD); Section 
on Harmful Algal Blooms in the North Pacific (S-HAB), Section on Climate Change Effects on 
Marine Ecosystems (S-CCME), Working Group on Development of Ecosystem Indicators to 
Characterize Ecosystem Responses to Multiple Stressors (WG 28), and Working Group on Non-
indigenous Aquatic Species (WG 21) among others (Fig. 1).  The objectives and activities of the 
Project are detailed in the workplan. 
 The project is directed by a Project Science Team (PST), co-chaired by Drs. Mitsutaku Makino 
(Fisheries Research Agency, Japan, mmakino@affrc.go.jp) and Ian Perry (Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, Canada; Ian.Perry@dfo-mpo.gc.ca), with membership from PICES and non-PICES countries, 
as deemed appropriate. 
 The PST Co-Chairmen are responsible for the scientific implementation of the project and reporting 
annually to MAFF/JFA and PICES Science Board.  The report should be submitted to JFA within 
120 days after the close of each project year ending March 31, and include a summary of the 
activities carried out in the year, with an evaluation on the progress made, and a workplan for the 
following year. 
This progress report summarizes the activities carried out in Year 1 (FY 2012: April 1, 2012–March 31, 
2013) and includes a workplan for Year 2 (FY 2013: April 1, 2013–March 31, 2014).  The draft budget 
for Year 2 is provided in the Year 1 financial report being submitted as a separate document simultaneously 
with this progress report.

3. PROGRESS OF YEAR 1 
3.1 Project Science Team 
PST membership 
The PST was formed in August 2012, in order to make recommendations for the project implementation 
and review the scientific progress.  The PST includes 13 members: 3 from Canada, 3 from Japan, 2 from 
Korea and 4 from USA, and a representative from the PICES Secretariat (Table 1).  A total of six PICES 
expert groups are represented on the Team:  S-HD, S-CCME, S-HAB, WG 28, WG 21 and AP-SOFE 
(FUTURE Advisory Panel on Status, Outlooks, Forecasts, and Engagement). 
First PST meeting 
The first PST meeting was held October 11, 2012, in conjunction with the PICES 2012 Annual Meeting 
in Hiroshima, Japan.  The main objectives of this meeting were to: 1) share the background information 
for the project, 2) decide the principal framework, and 3) discuss the workplan and financial allocations 
for Year 1 of the project.  Twelfth PST members were in attendance (Absentee: Dr. Dohoon Kim).  The 
report from the meeting is available on the project’s web page at 
http://meetings.pices.int/projects/marweb. 
The main results from the meeting can be summarized as follows: 
 The review of the previous PICES/MAFF project on “Development of the prevention systems for 
harmful organisms’ expansion in the Pacific Rim” (2007–2012) and information on other relevant 
activities, including the Sato-umi type research related to the Convention on Biological Diversity, 
United Nations University, etc., were presented; 
 The principal framework of the project was approved (Table 2); 
 Three field sites and their initial workplans were decided as the case study for this project (Table 3); 
 The “wll-being cube” was introduced as a tool to scientifically analyze the links between the 
ecosystem conditions and human well-being; 
 The construction of a database was approved in order to facilitate the dissemination of the results of 
this project and to share the knowledge related to the marine ecosystem health and human well-being. 
3.2 Case study:  Indonesia 
Three developing countries in three regions of the North Pacific (Southeast Asia, Pacific oceanic islands, 
and Central America) were selected as study sites for the project.  Indonesia was selected because of its 
large population and aquaculture-intensive industry.  Guatemala was chosen because its coastline features 
an upwelling system favorable for the finfish fishery and aquaculture.  Palau was selected because of its 
focus on the finfish capture fishery and its existing networks of community-based fisheries.  It was 
decided to conduct two training workshops in each of these countries.  In Year 1, the main focus was on 
Indonesia.

Many coastal mangroves in Indonesia were cut for advancing shrimp aquaculture in the 1990s, causing 
much erosion.  For example, in one location on the north coast of Java, 3 kilometers of coastline were lost 
due to this process.  The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (Badan 
Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknologi – BPPT) has developed a concept of managing coastal and marine 
resources by actively involving the community.  This Indonesian concept is called GEMPITA-SPL 
(Gerakkan Masyarakat Peduli Kelestarian Sumberdaya Perikanan, Pesisir dan Laut) or, in English, 
SFiCoMS (Sustainable Utilization of Fisheries, Coastal and Marine Resources for the Society).  The 
GEMPITA-SPL concept fits very well within the framework of fishery social-ecological systems (Sato-
umi) in the PICES/MAFF project.  Based on this concept, BPPT and the Java Department of Fisheries 
and Marine Affairs initiated a “GAPURA” program (Fig. 2) in the northern coastal area of West Java 
(initially in Karawang) through the development and promotion of environmentally friendly aquaculture 
technology called Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA).  The expectation is that by applying 
IMTA, the coastal environment, which has been heavily damaged by shrimp monoculture, can be 
recovered to become more biodiverse and productive, leading to a balanced and harmonious way to 
improve the welfare of local communities.  Unfortunately, impacts to local systems or environmental 
quality (nutrients, bacteria, phytoplankton, etc.) have not been monitored.  The Indonesian government 
would like to scientifically verify this activity, build capacity, and then disseminate the concept to other 
areas of the country.  Thus, this case study aims to: (1) scientifically verify the benefits of IMTA to the 
social-ecological systems, (2) develop scientific capacity in Indonesia, and (3) develop manual for 
dissemination to other areas in Indonesia.

The planning meeting for this case study was held January 22–23, 2013, at the BPPT Headquarters in 
Jakarta.  Drs. Mitsutaku Makino, Masahito Hirota and Mark Wells participated on behalf of the PST; the 
Indonesian counterpart was Prof. Suhendar Sachoemar.  The objectives of this meeting were to 
understand the local needs, to prepare the draft agenda for a workshop to be held in March of 2013, and to 
develop plans for this case study through to March 2017 (the PICES/MAFF project period). 
Based on the results of the January 2013 meeting, the first Indonesia training workshop was held March 
13, 2013, at the BPPT Headquarters in Jakarta, with a field trip to the site at Karawang on March 14.  The 
objectives of the workshop were to: (1) develop the contents of a manual that will describe GEMPITA-
SPL and GAPURA experiences in Java Province according to local conditions at some candidate sites, and 
(2) assess the utility of PICES’ scientific tools for enhancing the human well-being of local communities 
and rehabilitating coastal ecosystem at some candidate sites.  It was a high-profile event in Indonesia, with 
many reports appearing in newspapers, on TV and the web. 
A total of 93 participants from Indonesia, Japan and USA attended the workshop.  The PICES/MAFF 
project was represented by four PST members, Drs. Makino, Hirota, Wells and William Cochlan.  Dr. 
Makino introduced the project; Dr. Wells described previous activities of PICES in Indonesia and 
suggested ways that PICES science can support GEMPITA-SPL/GAPURA; and Dr. Hirota talked about 
PICES scientific tools for the analysis of human well-being in coastal societies. 
During the workshop, the Sato-umi concept was introduced, detailed local needs were gathered from local 
stakeholders, and the development of a GEMPITA-SPL/GAPURA manual was discussed (a table of 
contents was prepared) to facilitate the dissemination of GEMPITA-SPL activities in Indonesia.  The 
agreement was reached to conduct a pond experiment in Year 2 of the PICES/MAFF project to examine 
the natural ecological system and human system benefits of IMTA.  A draft protocol for the experiment in 
sample ponds where GEMPITA-SPL has been implemented and a draft list of parameters to be measured 
during this experiment was developed.  A Letter of Intent between PICES and BPPT was signed to 
recognize the importance of continued collaborative work on the project.  The workshop report and 
PICES Press article describing this event (Vol. 21, No. 2, pp. 18–19) are available on the project website at 
http://meetings.pices.int/projects/marweb. 
3.3 Analytical tools and database 
Analysis of human well-being in relation to environmental conditions 
“Well-being” is defined by psychologists as involving peoples’ positive evaluations of their lives such as 
positive emotions, engagement, satisfaction, and meaning.  As indicated in the UN Millennium 
Ecosystem Assessment, human well-being (HWB) has multiple constituents, such as basic materials for a 
good life, security, health, good social relations, and freedom of choice.  The constituents of well-being, 
as experienced and perceived by people, are situation-dependent, reflecting local geography, culture, and 
ecological circumstances.  These factors are complex and value-laden.  In the present study, HWB is being 
explored as a means to connect ecosystem services and freedom of choice and action, and in part to 
understand motivations for these choices and actions. 
In 2012, a survey of 1000 people in Japan was conducted to develop the method and assess their 
relationships with the sea.  Preliminary results suggest great importance of sea food for well-being among 
those Japanese people who identified themselves as having high connections with the ocean.

Database construction 
The PST discussed the potential content of the ‘database’ and agreed on the following outlines: 
 The database could be a bibliography, for example, of social-ecological systems interactions and 
related references that would be useful for research and capacity building activities. 
 It would be desirable for this database to also support the work of the PICES FUTURE program, and 
to link with the work of PICES WG 28 on human activities (and their related indicators) that affect 
the ocean. 
 The database could also store the techniques, tools, and results developed from the Indonesia and 
Guatemala case studies and their manuals. 
3.4 Other activities 
The International Sustainability Unit (ISU) of the UK Prince Charles’ Charitable Foundation has a marine 
program (http://www.pcfisu.org/marine-programme) which was initiated, among other objectives, to help 
strengthen international consensus around the best solutions for the sustainable management of wild 
marine fish stocks.  The ISU recently released a report based on interviews with fishing communities 
from 50 different fisheries around the world about the benefits they are experiencing from managing their 
fisheries more sustainably.  The report demonstrates the possibilities for more sustainable management 
through what is already being achieved.  The ISU is now developing a project to implement Fisheries 
Management Plans (FMP) and Transition Financing, and is considering Vietnam and Central America as 
primary locations.  In this regard, the ISU organized a regional workshop on “The opportunities of 
sustainable fisheries in Vietnam: Identifying the transition pathway” (October 30–31, 2012, Nha Trang, 
Vietnam), which was co-sponsored by PICES (through this project).  Although a useful meeting, it turned 
out to be somewhat off the main topic of our project.  It was recommended that the PST be informed of 
developments within the ISU but, at this stage, not to actively participate.

Scientific Progress Report for Year 2 
April 1, 2013–March 31, 2014 
1. BACKGROUND 
In December 2011, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan, through the 
Fisheries Agency of Japan (JFA), approved funding for a 5-year PICES project on “Marine Ecosystem 
Health and Human Well-Being”.  The project began in April 2012, and is expected to be completed by 
March 31, 2017.  Its goal is to identify the relationships between sustainable human communities and 
productive marine ecosystems in the North Pacific, under the concept of fishery social-ecological systems 
(known in Japan as the “Sato-umi” fisheries management system).  It recognizes that global changes are 
affecting both climate and human social and economic conditions.  Key questions of the project are:  
a) how do marine ecosystems support human well-being? and b) how do human communities support 
sustainable and productive marine ecosystems?  The project is also intended to foster partnerships with 
non-PICES member countries and related international programs and organizations.  This contribution is 
from the Official Development Assistance (ODA) Fund and therefore, involvement of developing Pacific 
Rim countries in activities is required under this project. 
The following organizational principles, agreed upon by MAFF/JFA and PICES, apply to the project: 
 The Project is expected to have strong connections and interactions with, and to involve and support 
the relevant activities of, the PICES FUTURE (Forecasting and Understanding Trends, Uncertainty 
and Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems) science program and PICES expert groups 
(Project Principle 3.1; Fig. 1). 
 The project is directed by a Project Science Team (PST), co-chaired by Drs. Mitsutaku Makino 
(Fisheries Research Agency, Japan, mmakino@affrc.go.jp) and Ian Perry (Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans, Canada; Ian.Perry@dfo-mpo.gc.ca), with membership from PICES and non-PICES 
countries, as deemed appropriate (Project Principle 3.1). 
 The PST Co-Chairmen are responsible for the scientific implementation of the project and reporting 
annually to MAFF/JFA and PICES Science Board.  The report should be submitted to JFA within 
120 days after the close of each project year ending March 31, and include a summary of the 
activities carried out in the year, with an evaluation on the progress made, and a workplan for the 
following year (Project Principle 3.2). 
This progress report summarizes the activities carried out for Year 2 (FY 2013: April 1, 2013–March 31, 
2014) and includes a workplan for Year 3 (FY 2014: April 1, 2014–March 31, 2015).  The financial 
report for Year 2 is being submitted as a separate document simultaneously with this progress report. 
2. WORKPLAN FOR YEAR 2

interactions, the well-being survey data and information from the Indonesia and Guatemala case 
studies. 
3. PROGRESS OF YEAR 2 
3.1 Project Science Team meetings 
The Project Science Team (PST) was established in August 2012 (Year 1) in order to review the scientific 
progress, and make recommendations on the further implementation of the project.  During Year 2, the 
PST membership was revised to better match the case studies that are being developed.  As of June 2014, 
the PST membership includes 13 scientists: 4 from Canada, 3 from Japan, 2 from Korea and 3 from USA, 
and a representative from the PICES Secretariat (Table 1).  A total of six PICES expert groups are 
represented on the Team:  Section on Hunan Dimensions of Marine Systems (S-HD), Section on Climate 
Change Effects on Marine Ecosystems (S-CCME), Section on Ecology of Harmful Algal Blooms in the 
North Pacific (S-HAB), Working Group on Non-indigenous Aquatic Species (WG 21), Working Group 
on Development of Ecosystem Indicators to Characterize Ecosystem Responses to Multiple Stressors 
(WG 28) and FUTURE Scientific Steering Committee (FUTURE SSC).

In Year 2, two PST meetings were organized.  The first meeting was held June 10–12, 2013, in Honolulu, 
USA, and focused on plans for workshops, experiments and social science surveys in Indonesia.  Also, 
the name “MarWeB”, for Marine Ecosystem Health and Human Well-Being, was adopted as an acronym 
for the project.  The second meeting was convened October 10, 2013, in Nanaimo, Canada, in 
conjunction with the 2013 PICES Annual Meeting, and focused on developing plans for research 
activities in Guatemala.  A 0.5-day Topic Session on “Ecological and human social analyses and issues 
relating to Integrated Multi Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA)”, led by the MarWeB project, was proposed and 
accepted for the 2014 PICES Annual Meeting (Yeosu, Korea), and is currently being organized.  The 
reports from both of these meetings and other materials, including two PICES Press articles describing 
the project’s goals and activities, are available at http://meetings.pices.int/projects/marweb. 
3.2 Case studies 
3.2.1 Indonesia 
Intensive shrimp aquaculture was developed in the Karawang area (3 hours from Jakarta) in the 1990s.  
This led to de-forestation, then marine pollution, shrimp mass-diseases, and ultimately to pond 
abandonment.  The main issue is serious environmental degradation and land erosion due to removal of 
mangroves and building of coastal shrimp ponds.  This has resulted in a current ecological system with 
intensive shrimp monoculture.  The MarWeB project is developing a study on the use of IMTA 
(including seaweed, shrimp and fish) to demonstrate low emissions of deleterious materials into the 
natural environment and to provide alternative sources of protein and livelihoods for the local human 
population. 
During Year 2, MarWeB activities included the following: 
 Ecological systems 
o Nutrient and phytoplankton training workshop; 
o Preparation for a pond experiment for IMTA; 
o Material circulation box-model development for analysing the carrying capacity of these 
systems. 
 Social systems 
o Basic social information collection (i.e., statistics); 
o Commodity chain analysis for IMTA products; 
o Psychological analysis for human “well-being” (“Well-Being Cube” analysis). 
Ecological systems 
Project activities in Indonesia are being conducted in collaboration with BPPT (Badan Pengkajian dan 
Penerapan Teknologi; the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology, Jakarta), which is a 
non-departmental government agency under the coordination of the Ministry of Research and 
Technology, responsible for carrying out government duties in the field of assessment and application of 
technology.  An experimental plan has been developed for a MarWeB-sponsored GEMPITA (Sato-umi) 
pond experiment, to be conducted at the National Center for Brackishwater Aquaculture in Karawang.  
The main purpose of this experiment is to investigate the effects of IMTA on: (1) the economic return of 
Appendix 2 – Annual Progress Reports Year 2 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 73 
pond operations, and (2) the water quality of the ponds.  Water quality is defined in terms of the 
concentrations of nitrate/nitrite, ammonia, and phosphate, in addition to other parameters (e.g., salinity, 
oxygen, phytoplankton, bacteria, etc.).  The hypothesis being studied is whether the addition of bivalves 
(oysters) and seaweed into pond aquaculture of fish (Tilapia species) or shrimp will allow successful 
growth of all species, and decrease the nutrient (nitrite/nitrate, ammonia, phosphate) concentrations in the 
pond waters. 
To build the methodological skills to conduct the experiment, a Nutrient and phytoplankton training 
workshop, led by Drs. Mitsutaku Makino and Mark Wells, was held March 25–26, 2014, at the National 
Center for Brackishwater Aquaculture.  There were 16 official Indonesian participants.  The workshop 
was a success, with the objectives fully met and the skills raised to the quality needed for publication of 
the pond experiment results (Fig. 2).  Another training workshop is being planned to be held in 
Pekalongan in Year 3. 
Dr. Susanna Nurdjaman (Bandung Institute of Technology) started the construction of the material 
circulation box-model in order to analyze the monitoring results from the pond experiment.

Year 2 Appendix 2 – Annual Progress Reports

Social systems 
Two social science field surveys were conducted in October 2013 and March 2014, with focus on 
mapping the commodity chains and collecting statistics in Karawang (Java) and Indonesia more broadly.  
This information consisted of the human dimensions (number of employees, income level of owner and 
employees, employee’s education, age, sex, side jobs, work schedule, welfare or medical costs in terms of 
employment), business (commodities and commodity chain, value and amount of production, price, types 
of trading partners), and technical matters (original method, costs, environmental damages, new culture 
methods, strategies/perspectives for the future).  Figure 3 shows the commodity chain of the IMTA 
products, which was developed based on the information from the above two surveys.  Also, in February 
and March 2014, the social survey for well-being (“well-being cube” analysis), which was developed in 
Year 1, was conducted in Indonesia.  A total of 200 samples were collected and now are being analyzed.

3.2.2 Guatemala 
A scoping visit to Guatemala was conducted from January 27–31, 2014, to assess the possibility of this 
country being a case study within the MarWeB project to evaluate the relationships between coastal 
communities and the sea, and the potential to develop the use of IMTA.  Four representatives from PICES 
met and discussed potential options for this work with government representatives, academic researchers, 
and community leaders and members in Guatemala City and along portions of the Pacific coast (Fig. 4). 
The villages visited were Monterrico, Hawaii, and Las Lisas.  It was apparent that complex relationships 
exist between members of the communities, shrimp farmers and government and academic institutions 
that varied in every community.  These relationships appeared to be influenced by the degree of financial 
Appendix 2 – Annual Progress Reports Year 2 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 75 
stability, the health of the estuaries and the degree of diversification of occupations, including fishing, 
aquaculture, agriculture and emerging tourism.  A possible goal for the MarWeB project in Guatemala is 
being developed in collaboration with Guatemalan experts to expand the economic potential (shellfish 
aquaculture) to bring greater well-being to coastal communities.  This would be a self-sustaining 
enterprise managed by a Guatemalan cooperative.  A project which focusses on oyster aquaculture is 
proposed in collaboration with University of San Carlos professors, which will consider growth, 
processing and marketing aspects. 
A social science survey to address “Sato-umi in developing nations” will be developed and applied to 
Guatemala in collaboration with Guatemalan University faculty and students, and coastal communities.

3.2.3 Palau 
The original plan for the MarWeB project included 3 case studies: Indonesia, Guatemala, and Palau.  
However, based on the latest information collected from literature reviews, news media reports, and 
personal contacts with the people of Palau, it was decided to discontinue Palau as a third case study 
because of: (1) reductions in the project annual budget and (2) banning of fishing and conversion of all of 
Palau’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) into a marine protected area.  This decision was reported to 
MAFF/JFA by Dr. Makino. 
3.3 Analysis of human well-being in relation to environmental conditions 
“Well-being” is defined by psychologists as involving peoples’ positive evaluations of their lives such as 
positive emotions, engagement, satisfaction, and meaning.  As indicated in the UN Millennium Ecosystem 
Assessment, human well-being (HWB) has multiple constituents, including basic materials for a good life, 
freedom and choice, health, good social relations, and security.  The constituents of well-being, as 
experienced and perceived by people, are situation-dependent, reflecting local geography, culture, and 
ecological circumstances.  These factors are complex and value-laden.  In the present study, HWB is being 
Year 2 Appendix 2 – Annual Progress Reports 
76 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
explored as a means to connect ecosystem services, human well-being, and freedom of choice and action, 
and in part to understand motivations for these choices and actions. 
In Year 1, a survey of 1000 people in Japan was conducted to further develop a methodology and to 
assess their relationships with the sea.  In Year 2, the same type of questionnaire was used to survey 500 
people in each Korea and the United States.  In addition, as mentioned above, a survey of 200 people was 
conducted in collaboration with BPPT in several Indonesian provinces to provide data for analysis of 
well-being in relation to the sea (i.e., in a Sato-umi context).  Preliminary analysis of the results from 
these four countries shows significant differences.  Overall results for Indonesia were consistent with a 
“high expectation”-type outcome, although results separated by different regions within Indonesia 
showed different outcomes indicating many important factors are involved.  These results are currently 
being prepared for scientific publication (Fig. 5). 
3.4 Database 
Development of the database containing a bibliography of human–natural systems interactions and the 
well-being survey data and information from the Indonesia and Guatemala case studies is continuing.

Year 3 Appendix 2 – Annual Progress Reports 
78 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
Scientific Progress Report for Year 3 
April 1, 2014–March 31, 2015 
1. BACKGROUND 
In December 2011, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan, through the 
Fisheries Agency of Japan (JFA), approved funding for a 5-year PICES project on “Marine Ecosystem 
Health and Human Well-Being” (MarWeb; http://www.pices.int/projects/marweb).  The project began in 
April 2012, with the ending date set as March 31, 2017.  Its goal is to identify the relationships between 
sustainable human communities and productive marine ecosystems in the North Pacific, under the 
concept of fishery social-ecological systems (known in Japan as the “Sato-umi” fisheries management 
system).  Considering that global changes are affecting both climate and human social and economic 
conditions, the project is expected to determine: a) how do marine ecosystems support human well-being? 
and b) how do human communities support sustainable and productive marine ecosystems?  The project 
is also intended to foster partnerships with non-PICES member countries and related international 
organizations/programs.  This contribution is from the Official Development Assistance (ODA) Fund and 
therefore, involvement of developing Pacific Rim countries in activities is required under this project 
The following organizational principles, agreed upon by MAFF/JFA and PICES, apply to the project: 
 The project is expected to have strong connections and interactions with, and to involve and support 
the relevant activities of, the PICES FUTURE (Forecasting and Understanding Trends, Uncertainty 
and Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems) science program and PICES expert groups 
(Project Principle 3.1; Fig. 1). 
 The project is directed by a Project Science Team (PST), co-chaired by Drs. Mitsutaku Makino 
(Fisheries Research Agency, Japan, mmakino@affrc.go.jp) and Ian Perry (Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans, Canada; Ian.Perry@dfo-mpo.gc.ca), with membership from PICES and non-PICES 
countries, as deemed appropriate (Project Principle 3.2). 
 The PST Co-Chairmen are responsible for the scientific implementation of the project and annual 
reporting to MAFF/JFA and PICES Science Board.  The report should be submitted to JFA within 120 
days after the close of each project year ending March 31, and include a summary of the activities 
carried out in the year, with an evaluation on the progress made, and a workplan for the following 
year (Project Principle 3.3). 
This progress report summarizes the activities carried out for Year 3 (FY 2014: April 1, 2014–March 31, 
2015) and includes a workplan for Year 4 (FY 2015: April 1, 2015–March 31, 2016).  The financial report 
for Year 3 is being submitted as a separate document simultaneously with this progress report. 
2. WORKPLAN FOR YEAR 3 
1. Project Science Team meetings 
 Organize two PST meetings, one inter-sessional (April 2014, Hawaii, USA) and in conjunction 
with the PICES 2014 Annual Meeting (October 2014, Yeosu, Korea).

site visit by a PST member; 
 Hold a workshop in Pekalongan for manual development and transfer of lessons learned during 
Karawang experiments to a second location; 
 Conduct the third social survey. 
 In Guatemala 
 Design, and translate into Spanish, a social survey to understand the local situation (e.g., why one 
community feels it is ‘healthy’ whereas adjacent communities feel they are not ‘healthy’); 
 Carry out a social science assessment of “Sato-umi” with local partners; 
 Design and conduct an IMTA experiment, with a focus on development of oyster aquaculture, 
processing and marketing, in collaboration with local partners. 
3. Human well-being surveys 
 Analyze the data and review the results from the human well-being surveys conducted in Japan, 
Korea, United States, and Indonesia. 
4. Database 
 Continue to develop the database including a bibliography of human-natural systems interactions 
and the well-being survey data and information from the Indonesia and Guatemala case studies; 
 Start to build the on-line access system for sharing the contents of the database. 
3. PROGRESS OF YEAR 3 
3.1 Project Science Team meetings 
The Project Science Team (PST) was established in August 2012 (Year 1) in order to review the scientific 
progress, and make recommendations for the implementation of the project.  During Year 3, the PST 
membership was revised to better match the case studies that are being developed.  As of March 2015, the 
PST membership includes 13 scientists: 4 from Canada, 3 from Japan, 2 from Korea and 3 from USA, 
and a representative from the PICES Secretariat (Table 1).  A total of five PICES expert groups are 
represented on the Team:  Section on Hunan Dimensions (S-HD), Section on Climate Change Effects on 
Marine Ecosystems (S-CCME), Section on Ecology of Harmful Algal Blooms in the North Pacific (S-
HAB), Working Group on Development of Ecosystem Indicators to Characterize Ecosystem Responses to 
Multiple Stressors (WG 28) and FUTURE Scientific Steering Committee (FUTURE SSC). 
In Year 3, two PST meetings were organized.  The first meeting was held April 13, 2014, on the Kohala 
Coast, Island of Hawaii, Hawaii, U.S.A., in conjunction with the PICES FUTURE Open Science 
Meeting.  The key objectives for that meeting were to: (a) plan for the Guatemala case study, (b) further 
develop the Indonesia case study, and (c) prepare the detailed workplan for FY 2014–2015.  The goal of 
Year 3 Appendix 2 – Annual Progress Reports 
80 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
the second meeting held October 16, 2014, in Yeosu, Korea, in conjunction with the PICES 2014 Annual 
Meeting (PICES-2014), was to review progress made since the April meeting.  A very successful topic 
session titled “Ecological and human social analyses and issues relating to Integrated Multi-Trophic 
Aquaculture” was convened at PICES-2014, with a large number of participants, including many not 
directly related to the MarWeB project.  The reports from both PST meetings and other materials are 
available at http://meetings.pices.int/projects/marweb.

3.2 Case studies 
3.2.1 Indonesia 
Intensive shrimp aquaculture was developed in the Karawang area (3 hours from Jakarta) in the 1990s, 
and led to de-forestation, then marine pollution, shrimp mass-diseases, and ultimately to pond 
abandonment.  The main issue is serious environmental degradation and land erosion due to removal of 
mangroves and building of coastal shrimp ponds.  This has resulted in a current ecological system with 
intensive shrimp monoculture.  The MarWeB project, in collaboration with the Agency for the 
Assessment and Application of Technology (Badan Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknologi, BPPT) of 
Indonesia, is conducting a study of the use of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA; including 
seaweed, shrimp and fish) to demonstrate low emissions of deleterious materials into the natural 
environment and to provide alternative sources of protein and livelihoods for the local human population. 
During Year 3, MarWeB activities in this case study included the following: 
 Ecological systems 
o Workshop was convened to disseminate the concept of Sato-umi (Gempita) in Indonesia; 
o Pond experiment for IMTA was started; 
o Material circulation box-model for analysing the carrying capacity in the pond was constructed. 
 Social systems 
o Basic social information (i.e., statistics) was collected and analyzed; 
o Commodity chain analysis for IMTA products was revised; 
Year 3 Appendix 2 – Annual Progress Reports 
82 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
o Preliminary study was started based on an “analytic hierarchy process” (AHP) approach to 
support local decision-making.  AHP is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing 
complex decisions; 
o Psychological survey analysis for well-being (i.e., “well-being cube” analysis) was completed. 
Ecological systems 
Project activities in Indonesia are being conducted in collaboration with BPPT, which is a non-
departmental government agency under the coordination of the Ministry of Research and Technology 
responsible for carrying out government duties in the field of assessment and application of technology.  
An experimental plan was developed for the MarWeB-sponsored Gempita (Sato-umi) pond experiment, 
which was started at the National Center for Brackishwater Aquaculture in Karawang, in August 2014.  
The main purpose of this experiment is to investigate the effect of IMTA on: (1) the economic return of 
pond operations, and (2) the water quality of the ponds, defined in terms of the (macro)nutrient 
concentrations of nitrate/nitrite, ammonia, and phosphate, in addition to other parameters (oxygen, 
phytoplankton, bacteria, etc.).  The underlining hypothesis is that the addition of bivalves (Anadara) and 
seaweed (Gracilaria) into the aquaculture ponds of fish (Tilapia species) or shrimp will allow successful 
growth of all species, and decrease of macronutrient concentrations in the pond waters. 
The optimal pond conditions for shrimp and fish are: 
 a high phytoplankton biomass, including diatoms and green algae – phytoplankton provide additional 
food which enhances the flavor of the shrimp and fish; 
 low light penetration which creates less stress for the shrimp and prevents the growth of seagrass in 
the pond. 
For these reasons, nutrients (nitrate, phosphate) are added to high concentrations at the start, which helps 
to maintain high biomass of phytoplankton over the duration of the pond experiment. 
The experiment was designed using four 4000 m
2
 ponds at the National Center for Brackishwater 
Aquaculture: Pond 1 – Shrimp only, Pond 2 – Shrimp + Gracilaria + Anadara, Pond 3 – Fish (Tilapia) 
only, and Pond 4 – Tilapia + Gracilaria + Anadara. 
Early results suggest the following: 
1. There appears to be no negative effect on the shrimp or Tilapia weight gain in the ponds with the 
Gracilaria and Anadara.  This was the main concern. 
2. The replenishment of water in the Tilapia ponds from the reservoir is a potential source of nutrient 
variability, but concentrations in all ponds seem to track each other reasonably well (particularly 
NO

).  The implication is that despite the considerable mixing (from paddle mixers), vertical 
gradients may be forming within the 1 m deep ponds.  There also may be variation from site to site 
within the pond as the water circulates.  Collecting vertically integrated samples was suggested. 
3. The biggest problem was the high level of nutrient added to the ponds to generate enough plankton to 
prevent light from reaching the bottom of the pond.

Social systems 
A revised commodity chain model was developed (Fig. 2).  A ‘system dynamics’ model is being 
considered to explore the effects of changing parameters (e.g., in the commodity chain), and to examine 
the impacts of changes to various social parameters.  An AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) approach is 
also being investigated to evaluate the choice of scenarios (e.g., the effects on outcomes of intensive 
culture, polyculture and IMTA approaches).  The social survey for the “well-being cube” analysis was 
completed in Indonesia with the assistance of BPPT, and the results are now being analyses and compared 
with results from similar surveys in Japan, the United States, and Korea.

3.2.2 Guatemala 
Much of Year 3 was focused on developing the MarWeB program in Guatemala.  Two science themes 
have been adopted: (1) a focus on multi-trophic aquaculture for the natural science theme, and (2) a social 
science survey to understand how people and their livelihoods relate to the ocean. 
Theme 1 involves collaborating with researchers at the University of San Carlos, Guatemala City, and 
with the Integral Fisheries Cooperative on the Pacific coast of Guatemala, to test the feasibility of 
growing, processing and marketing Crassostrea gigas (mangrove oyster) using an IMTA approach.  The 
potential outcomes include increased income for coastal people, and improved health and well-being.  
Specific objectives are: assessing the performance of the long-line shellfish culture system in La Barrona 
estuarine lagoons; determining yield potential of the culture system, including growth rates and time for 
mollusks to reach market size; evaluating shellfish survival rates during different phases of their growth 
Year 3 Appendix 2 – Annual Progress Reports 
84 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
and assessing mitigation methods against predation; adapting or developing culture practices appropriate 
for the management of the system; producing oysters that conform to the microbiologic standards of food 
safety; and assisting in finding suitable markets for the sale of the final product. 
The project is now ongoing.  For the first three months, sampling is being done every 2 weeks, and then 
will switch to once a month for the next 4 months.  The monitored parameters are dissolved inorganic 
nutrients, dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature, light transmission and phytoplankton.  The monitoring 
is being carried out by students and faculty using equipment previously provided by the now completed 
PICES International Seafood Safety Project (ISSP) also funded by MAFF (Fig. 3).  That PICES ISSP 
project provided training in identifying harmful algal species and measuring the toxicity of seafood 
exposed to toxic algae.

University of San Carlos in Guatemala conducting water quality sampling for the oyster culture 
project and during currently ongoing harmful algal bloom monitoring efforts along the Guatemalan 
coast. 
A mission to Guatemala City and two Pacific coastal towns (Las Lisas and Monterrico) was undertaken 
from February 26–March 7, 2015 to implement the social survey.  These surveys were conducted with 
approximately 20 families in each of these two coastal towns, using a set of 34 questions with 5 possible 
answers from a computer to provide anonymity to the respondents.  The survey asked questions such as 
how often the family buys seafood from the market, and whether the ocean provides enough food for the 
family.  The surveys lasted approximately 1 hour, after which students conducted a follow-up interview to 
explore responses in more detail (Fig. 4).

3.3 Analysis of human well-being in relation to environmental conditions 
“Well-being” is defined by psychologists as involving peoples’ positive evaluations of their lives such as 
positive emotions, engagement, satisfaction, and meaning.  As identified in the UN Millennium 
Ecosystem Assessment, human well-being (HWB) has multiple constituents, including basic materials for 
a good life, freedom and choice, health, good social relations, and security.  The constituents of well-being, 
as experienced and perceived by people, are situation-dependent, reflecting local geography, culture, and 
ecological circumstances.  These factors are complex and value-laden.  In the present study, HWB is 
being explored as a means to connect ecosystem services, human well-being, and freedom of choice and 
action, and in part to understand motivations for these choices and actions. 
The “well-being cube” was developed to understand the structure of HWB in relation to the sea (i.e., in a 
Sato-umi context).  In Year 1, a survey of 1000 people in Japan was conducted to assess their relationships 
with the sea (Fig. 5).  In Year 2, the same questionnaire was used to survey 500 people in Korea (Fig. 6) 
and the United States (Fig. 7).  In addition to these three PICES member countries, a survey of 200 people 
was conducted, in collaboration with BPPT, in several Indonesian provinces to provide data for analyses 
of well-being in relation to the sea (Fig. 8).  The well-being cube was built up with human-needs, and it 
shows distinctions among HWB structure of each country (red shows high-expectation and satisfaction 
need, blue is low-expectation and satisfaction need, yellow is high-expectation and low-satisfaction need, 
and green is low-expectation and high-satisfaction need).  Also, a result from the SEM (Structural 
Equation Modeling) analysis showed the commonalities and differences to achieve “freedom of choice 
and action” among countries (Fig. 9). 
Publication for a peer-review journal is now under preparation.  Some initial findings indicate that all 
countries surveyed have similar general concepts of well-being in regards to the ocean; however, the 
specific understanding of how the ocean affects human well-being differ among these countries and, 
therefore, what makes for a desirable relationship between people and the sea is different among 
countries.

Scientific Progress Report for Year 4 
April 1, 2015 – March 31, 2016 
1. BACKGROUND 
In December 2011, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan, through the 
Fisheries Agency of Japan (JFA), approved funding for a 5-year PICES project on “Marine Ecosystem 
Health and Human Well-Being” (MarWeB; http://www.pices.int/projects/marweb).  The project began in 
April 2012, with the ending date set as March 31, 2017.  Its goal is to identify the relationships between 
sustainable human communities and productive marine ecosystems in the North Pacific, under the 
concept of fishery social-ecological systems (known in Japan as the “Sato-umi” fisheries management 
system).  Considering that global changes are affecting both climate and human social and economic 
conditions, the project is expected to determine: a) how do marine ecosystems support human well-being? 
and b) how do human communities support sustainable and productive marine ecosystems?  The project 
is also intended to foster partnerships with non-PICES member countries and related international 
organizations/programs.  This contribution is from the Official Development Assistance (ODA) Fund and 
therefore, involvement of developing Pacific Rim countries in activities is required under this project. 
The following organizational principles, agreed upon by MAFF/JFA and PICES, apply to the project: 
 The project is expected to have strong connections and interactions with, and to involve and support 
the relevant activities of, the PICES FUTURE (Forecasting and Understanding Trends, Uncertainty 
and Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems) science program and PICES expert groups 
(Project Principle 3.1; Fig. 1). 
 The project is directed by a Project Science Team (PST), co-chaired by Drs. Mitsutaku Makino 
(Fisheries Research Agency, Japan, mmakino@affrc.go.jp) and Ian Perry (Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans, Canada; Ian.Perry@dfo-mpo.gc.ca), with membership from PICES and non-PICES 
countries, as deemed appropriate (Project Principle 3.2). 
 The PST Co-Chairmen are responsible for the scientific implementation of the project and annual 
reporting to MAFF/JFA and PICES Science Board.  This report should be submitted to JFA within 120 
days after the close of each project year ending March 31, and include a summary of the activities 
carried out in the year, with an evaluation on the progress made, and a workplan for the following 
year (Project Principle 3.3). 
This progress report summarizes the activities carried out for Year 4 (FY 2015: April 1, 2015 to March 31, 
2016) and includes a workplan for Year 5 (FY 2016: April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017). 
The Project Coordinator, Dr. Alexander Bychkov (bychkov@pices.int), is responsible for the management 
of the MAFF Fund and annual reporting on its disposition to MAFF/FRA and PICES Governing Council 
within 120 days after the close of each project year.  The financial report for Year 4 is being submitted as 
a separate document simultaneously with this progress report.

3.1 Project Science Team meetings 
The Project Science Team (PST) was established in August 2012 (Year 1) in order to review the scientific 
progress, and make recommendations for the implementation of the project.  The PST membership was 
unchanged in Year 4.  As of April 2015, the PST membership includes 13 scientists: 4 from Canada, 3 
from Japan, 2 from Korea and 3 from USA, and a representative from the PICES Secretariat (Table 1).  A 
total of five PICES expert groups are represented on the Team:  Section on Hunan Dimensions (S-HD), 
Section on Climate Change Effects on Marine Ecosystems (S-CCME), Section on Ecology of Harmful 
Algal Blooms in the North Pacific (S-HAB), Working Group on Development of Ecosystem Indicators to 
Characterize Ecosystem Responses to Multiple Stressors (WG 28) and FUTURE Scientific Steering 
Committee (FUTURE SSC).

In Year 4, one PST meeting was held.  It was convened on October 14, 2015, in conjunction with the 2015 
PICES Annual Meeting in Qingdao, China.  The key objectives of the meeting were to: (a) develop plans 
for the Guatemala case study, (b) further develop the Indonesia case study, (c) review progress and plans 
for the social science survey project (“well-being cube” analysis) and (d) prepare the detailed workplan 
for FY 2015–2016.  The report from the 2015 PST meeting and other project-related materials are 
available on the project’s website at http://meetings.pices.int/projects/marweb. 
3.2 CASE STUDIES 
3.2.1 Indonesia 
Ecological systems 
“Sato-umi” is the concept of the sustainable management where human intervention in the management of 
fishery resources in coastal and marine areas can increase productivity and diversity of fishery resources.  
More broadly the concept strives to achieve a balance between the utilization natural resources, while 
maintaining ecosystem stability.  The MarWeB project is investigating the use of multi-trophic 
aquaculture in brackish water shrimp and Tilapia ponds in Indonesia.  Intensive shrimp aquaculture was 
developed in the Karawang area (3 hours from Jakarta) in the 1990s, and led to de-forestation, then 
marine pollution, shrimp mass-diseases, and ultimately to pond abandonment.  The main issue is serious 
environmental degradation and land erosion as a result of removal of mangroves and building of coastal 
shrimp ponds.  This has resulted in a current ecological system with intensive shrimp monoculture. 
The goal of this MarWeB activity is to optimize the balance between maximizing harvesting of the 
primary economic product (shrimp or Tilapia), adding further income through by-production of co-
cultured food or marine products, and minimizing the excess nutrient discharge from these operations into 
coastal waters, which currently leads to degradation of coastal ecosystems.  The focus has been on 
experimenting with methods and approaches that are amenable to the low-intensity, low technology, and 
limited financial resource conditions that describe community-scale aquaculture in Karawang so that the 
project outcomes can have tangible effects on improving human well-being in this region.  This activity is 
conducted in collaboration with Indonesian colleagues at the Agency for The Assessment and Application 
of Technology (BPPT) in Jakarta, and the National Center for Brackishwater Aquaculture (NCBA), in 
Karawang, Indonesia. 
In 2015, the MarWeB project supported a second pond experiment which built upon the findings of the 
first experiment in the summer/fall of 2014.  The 2015 experiment was run for 100 days at the end of 
which both shrimp and Tilapia were successfully harvested.  The experimental results were reviewed in a 
small workshop held in Karawang in April 2016 that comprised the participants from PICES, BPPT, and 
the personnel at NCBA who were responsible for the day-to-day operation of the ponds and the extensive 
sample analyses.  The experimental design for the 2015 experiment followed the general principle of the 
2014 experiment, but was run in 1000 m
2
 ponds, which are easier to maintain.  The growth of shrimp and 
Tilapia were compared in the presence and absence of two co-cultured species: the algae Gracilaria, a 
common food and industrial aquaculture product, and the clam Anadara (Fig. 2).  The experimental 
design comprised two controls (shrimp alone, Tilapia alone), two treatments (shrimp + Gracilaria + 
Anadara, and Tilapia + Gracilaria + Anadara), and a treatment that contained all 4 species (shrimp + 
Tilapia + Gracilaria + Anadara).  The experiment was run for 100 days and was ended when the Tilapia 
and shrimp in all ponds began showing signs of stress.

nutrients for the cultivation of other commodities, resulting in a product that can be harvested, and 
can reduce environmental impact (graphic provided by NCBA). 
In terms of preliminary general results, the 2015 experiment was more successful than in 2014 in that 
there the Whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and Tilapia sp. showed good growth in all treatments, 
although the overall yield was less than NCBA staff had hoped.  Overall health of these primary 
aquaculture products (the economic mainstays) was good up until the final few days of the experiment 
when signs of stress were observed in all ponds at equal levels (i.e., there was no correlation with 
treatments or controls).  A detailed report on the findings from this experiment is being prepared for 
publication.  In addition, a draft plan for a follow-up experiment to be conducted in the fall of 2016, 
derived from discussions during the April 2016 workshop, is also being developed. 
The two experiments conducted to date (in 2014 and 2015) have benefited greatly from the enthusiasm 
and expertise of the BPPT and NCBA participants.  The project findings have been very encouraging, and 
the steps taken forward have been broadly communicated to other agencies and communities in 
Indonesia.  There is a strong interest within the Indonesian community to follow on with the development 
of this type of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, as the country is moving forward to greatly expand 
aquaculture output over the next decade.  An article was published describing this project (Wells et al. 
2016. PICES Press 24(1): 29-31). 
Social systems 
Social science research in Indonesia focused on the development of commodity chains and how people 
valued their marine environment.  In 2015, this research was expanded to cover Sulawesi.  The approach 
included: (1) a preliminary analysis of the human geography of the areas of interest, (2) stakeholder 
mapping, which is to be followed by (3) a workshop for consensus building.  As a result of a change in 
the research duties of one of the key social science researchers with the Indonesia case study, Dr. 
Masahito Hirota, comparisons of methods to identify how people interact with their marine environment 
have been expanded to include Thailand.  The survey method to identify commodity chains was also 
simplified so that it could be applied by people, such as local officers, who may not have scientific 
training.  An example of how this approach can be integrated and presented is provided in Figure 3.

3.2.2 Guatemala 
The MarWeB project activities in Guatemala during Year 4 were focused on two studies: (1) a 
Community Needs Assessment (CNA) of two small coastal communities, and (2) an oyster aquaculture 
project (for cross-comparisons with MarWeB activities in Indonesia). 
The CNA is a systematic process for determining the needs (e.g., economic, nutritional, and social) and 
the definable goals of a community.  CNAs can assist in directing resources and energies into creating the 
desired future of a community and can be used to address “gaps” between the current and desired 
conditions.  CNAs are performed before major actions are implemented as part of a strategic planning 
process.  In collaboration with colleagues at the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala, the MarWeB 
team engaged in a series of conversations with community members from two villages along the Pacific 
coast of Guatemala – Las Lisas and Monterrico.  The question for the communities on the first visit (in 
January 2014) was simply “What is your relationship with the sea?”  The fishermen and fisherwomen of 
Las Lisas enthusiastically responded that the sea is their life and, while fishing is a struggle and 
challenging occupation, they would like to create a balanced approach to fisheries so that the next 
generation has ample resources for the community.  In other words, they wish to develop a sustainable 
relationship with the sea.  Collectively they accepted responsibility for the dwindling fish stocks and 
confided that they had overfished the estuaries and coastal waterways.  In one community, the fishers felt 
they may be the “last fisherman” in Guatemala.  The communal statements were clear and honest and 
reflected a fear for the future.  These were communities motivated to make a change, but felt that change 
would be limited, and were unsure how to proceed.  The second visit (in February 2015) focused on a CNA 
in these villages to permit a greater understanding of the complex community dynamics of Las Lisas and 
Monterrico in regards to their relationship with the sea and their well-being. 
For the CNAs of Las Lisas and Monterrico, both surveys and interviews were conducted.  Multiple families 
were interviewed: 20 families in Las Lisas, and 29 families in Monterrico.  The questionnaire consisted of 
34 questions.  The questions fell into four areas: (1) questions to introduce the process so that the families 
could familiarize themselves with the approach and diminish any anxiety associated with the survey 
itself;  (2) questions that helped delineate the demographics of the responder; (3) questions that probed 
the demand and accessibility of fish/protein supply; and (4) questions that examined the willingness of 
respondents to change their relationship with the resources of the sea. 
Separate reports were provided to each community, with a synthesis of the survey results, conclusions and 
recommendations.  A synthesis of the major recommendations includes the following: 
For Las Lisas 
1. A healthier lifestyle in Las Lisas can be facilitated with opportunities for better education, sustainable, 
environmentally-friendly tourism, and environmentally-considerate aquaculture opportunities. 
2. Protection of the lagoon waters is essential, as these waters are breeding grounds for many major 
economically valuable species. 
3. Community-wide, coordinated eco-tourism and fishing trips for tourists can be implemented to create 
a more sustainable alternative to fishing for food. 
4. Alternative source of fish-based food supplies must be sought – such as through aquaculture. 
Appendix 2 – Annual Progress Reports  Year 4 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 95 
For Monterrico 
1. Communities leaders may use the report as a tool to secure funding for future eco-friendly 
development, while carefully considering which opportunities best promote community as well as 
ecosystem health. 
2. The community of Monterrico has a unique relationship with the Universidad de San Carlos de 
Guatemala research lab and should work with this lab to develop sustainable (but perhaps not 
immediately obvious) associations.  In this case, sustainable aquaculture must also protect the natural 
beauty of the Monterrico region to allow ecotourism to flourish. 
3. A more healthy future in Monterrico can be facilitated with opportunities for better education, with 
young and enthusiastic community members returning “home” from the big city with new ideas. 
4. Monterrico has moved away from the natural fisheries operation, but tourist fisheries are important to 
the eco-tourism opportunity.  A switch to eco-tourism means major changes for the community.  
Housing and feeding visitors will be the most difficult change. 
The aquaculture project in Guatemala had difficulties due to left of equipment.  The focus species is the 
Japanese oyster Crassiostrea gigas, which has been cultivated in Guatemala in previous research projects.  
During the site visit in early 2016, it was agreed that the experimental culture setup would be moved to 
the nearby Naval Base until the oysters are large enough to survive the higher sediment load in the waters 
of the La Barrona estuary.  The 3-year agreement with the Navy to use a small area of the port facility will 
benefit the community and strengthen the relationship between the community and the Navy.  Currently, a 
small number of pearl oysters and local oysters are being grown to test the water conditions and 
objectives of the project.  The plan is to purchase oysters for food and start growing them shortly.  This 
collaborative project with the Guatemala Navy, the University of San Carlos experts in oyster 
aquaculture, and a community near the border of El Salvador called La Barrona, serves as a model for 
bringing an alternative food source to an impoverished community in a developing nation.  This 
partnership has opened avenues of collaboration among the local communities, the military, and the 
University.  It can serve as an example for similar coastal communities in Guatemala and elsewhere. 
3.2.3 Palau 
A preliminary research investigation was conducted for the MarWeB project in Palau by Dr. Kumiko 
Suzuki, a Research Scientist with the Japan Wildlife Research Center.  The fishery of Palau is categorized 
into six types: coastal commercial, coastal subsistence, offshore locally-based, offshore foreign-based, 
freshwater, and aquaculture.  The offshore fishery is dominated by foreign fishing vessels, which mainly 
export tuna and bonito from Palau.  The main catch in coastal area is reef fish, such as groupers, snappers, 
etc., which are used for domestic consumption.  Fish consumption is decreasing gradually in Palau.  
However, compared to other island countries in the Pacific region, such as Samoa and the Solomon 
Islands, the consumption of fish is relatively high. 
Fresh fish are landed in the fish markets and distributed to the local communities.  There were 16 fish 
markets which were operated by fishing associations under the Palau Federation of Fishing Association 
(PFFA).  At present, most of these fishing associations are ceasing operations, and the number of local 
fish markets is decreasing.  Newly opened hotels and restaurants are trying to get fresh fish for the guests 
directly from the local fishermen.  As a result, the distribution system through fish markets is not 
currently functioning well. 
Year 4 Appendix 2 – Annual Progress Reports 
96 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
At the national level, the environmental conservation policy is dominated by the Palau National Marine 
Sanctuary Act.  This Act was approved in October 2015, to protect natural resources and the marine 
environment in Palau.  A total of 80%of Palau’s EEZ is designated as a fully protected marine reserve in 
which extractive activities such as fishing or mining are prohibited.  The marine sanctuary will be 
implemented over a 5-year period, and the number of foreign vessels will decrease annually.  The 
remaining 20% of the EEZ is a Domestic Fishing Zone reserved for local fishermen, and small-scale 
fisheries are allowed only for the domestic market.  The zone is designated to ensure food security in 
Palau and the fish supply for tourists.  Monitoring of illegal fishing is a challenge, which is being 
addressed.  Previously, fishing vessels operating in Palau’s EEZ monitored for poaching, but the 
monitoring by fishermen cannot be expected once the fishing activities are prohibited in the EEZ.  As a 
result of these changes, the state will lose 5–10 million dollars of fishing rights from the foreign vessels 
annually.  It is another issue for the state to secure the fund to strengthen a monitoring system. 
The Protected Area Network Act was adopted in 2003 to enable the national government to be involved and 
to enhance the efficiency of protected areas by networking with the regional activities.  The Act defines that 
the national government should provide technical assistance or funding to facilitate the effective 
management of protected areas in the region.  At the State level, Koror state has set up strict regulations for 
visiting the Rock Islands Southern Lagoon (RISL), located in the south of Koror.  RISL is a World Heritage 
Site and the most popular tourist site in Palau.  Koror state collects $50 from visitors as an Entry Permit fee, 
which is used to strengthen monitoring in the RISL area.  There are seven protected areas in RISL, and all 
areas are no-take.  In the process of designation of no-take areas, the state government met with local 
fishermen and sought their cooperation.  Currently, local fishermen are members of the advisory team of the 
Koror Pride Campaign which is conducted by the state government to enhance conservation of this marine 
ecosystem. 
In summary, designating the National Marine Sanctuary may have negative impacts not only on the foreign-
based fisheries but also on the domestic market.  The bycatch of sword fish or mahi mahi fisheries are 
consumed locally, and represent 20% of the total catch.  By restricting the fisheries in the EEZ, this bycatch 
cannot be distributed in the local market.  Local fishermen are allowed to fish in the Domestic Fishing Zone, 
however they do not fish regularly, and therefore the supply of fish is likely to be intermittent.  
Consequently, the volume of fish used for local consumption is likely to decrease.  Large increases in 
tourism can cause damage to the natural resources in Palau, as a result of overfishing due to the growth of 
demand for fish with increasing tourism.  In conclusion, disseminating the “Sato-umi” concept may not be 
appropriate in Palau, because the current marine policy of Palau is leading to exclusion of the fisheries 
industry. 
3.3 ANALYSIS OF HUMAN WELL-BEING IN RELATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS 
“Well-being” is defined by psychologists as involving peoples’ positive evaluations of their lives such as 
positive emotions, engagement, satisfaction, and meaning.  As identified in the UN Millennium Ecosystem 
Assessment, human well-being (HWB) has multiple constituents, including basic materials for a good life, 
freedom and choice, health, good social relations, and security.  The HWB constituents, as experienced 
and perceived by people, are situation-dependent, reflecting local geography, culture, and ecological 
circumstances.  These factors are complex and value-laden.  In the present study, HWB is being explored 
as a means to connect ecosystem services, human well-being, and freedom of choice and action, and in part 
to understand motivations for these choices and actions. 
Appendix 2 – Annual Progress Reports  Year 4 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 97 
The “well-being cube” was developed to understand the structure of HWB in relation to the sea (i.e., in a 
Sato-umi context).  A short paper describing this approach is published in PICES Press (Hori, J. 2015. A 
psychological perspective on “human well-being”: An international comparison of the well-being 
structure. PICES Press 23(2): 28-30).  In Year 1, a survey of 1000 people in Japan was conducted to assess 
their relationships with the sea.  In Year 2, the same questionnaire was used to survey 500 people in each 
Korea and the United States.  In Year 3, a survey of 200 people was conducted, in collaboration with 
BPPT, in several Indonesian provinces.  In Year 4, the same questionnaire was used to survey 500 people 
in each China and Russia.  Preliminary results of these surveys are summarized in Figure 4, and show 
clear differences among countries. 
4. WORK PLAN FOR YEAR 5 
1. Project Science Team meetings 
 Organize two Project Science Team meeting: in June 2016 in Victoria, BC, Canada and in 
November 2016 at the PICES Annual Meeting in San Diego, California, USA.  The June 
meeting will focus on integration among the MarWeB activities, and development of the 
manual. 
2. Case studies 
In Indonesia 
 Conduct a third multi-trophic aquaculture pond experiment with Indonesian partners at 
Karawang experimental site, including site visit by PST members;

environment interactions (Sato-Umi) during the pond experiments. 
In Guatemala 
 Continue the pilot oyster project by providing further guidance to the involved community 
members of the village of La Barrona; 
 Engage with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to synergize the results of 
the MarWeB project with the goals of the recently funded UNDP project on Marine Protected 
Areas (MPAs) to develop the new MPAs proposed for the coastal communities of Las Lisas and 
Monterrico; 
 Contribute the establishment of a community outreach program at the Center for the Study of 
the Sea and Aquaculture (CEMA) in Monterrico, by providing an example of how to build and 
operate a sustainable aquaculture pond in the coastal region. 
3. Human well-being surveys 
 Conduct web-based surveys in Canada; 
 Analyze the data and review the results from the human well-being surveys conducted in all 
PICES member countries (Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Russia and USA) and Indonesia.

First Meeting of the Project Science Team 
October 11, 2012, Hiroshima, Japan 
The first meeting of the Project Science Team (PST) for the PICES project on “Marine Ecosystem Health 
and Human Well-Being”, funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan, 
through the Fisheries Agency of Japan (JFA), was held October 11, 2012, in conjunction with the PICES 
Annual Meeting in Hiroshima, Japan.  The meeting was co-chaired by Drs. Mitsutaku Makino (Japan) and 
Ian Perry (Canada). 
The PST members and meeting participants are identified in Appendix 1, and the meeting agenda is 
presented in Appendix 2. 
BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT 
 Progress is being made internationally on an ecosystem approach to the management of marine 
systems. 
 Very recently, the concept of human well-being within marine social-ecological systems has become 
recognized as an important step forward. 
 Well-being shifts the perspective from objective measures of sustainable livelihoods (comprised of 
the physical, social, human, natural, and financial resources available to a community or country) to 
include the subjective or perceived well-being of individuals and communities.  This represents a 
shift from people as exploiters of the ocean to people as integral components of resource 
sustainability and ecosystem health (Coulthard et al. 2011; Charles 2012). 
 The Japanese “Sato-umi” (village-sea) concept is an example of this humans-in-nature approach, in 
which a healthy ecosystem is seen to nourish human well-being, and human activities are seen as 
necessary for sustaining ecosystem health.  Therefore, this project is proposed and funded by the 
Japanese government. 
Ecosystem services and human well-being was recognized in the UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 
(2005), although it was noted in discussion that the connecting arrows should go both directions (see the 
chart on next page). 
The project goal is to identify the relationships between sustainable human communities and productive 
marine ecosystems in the North Pacific, under the concept of fishery social-ecological systems.  
Considering that global changes are affecting both climate and human social and economic conditions, 
the project is expected to determine: (a) how marine ecosystems support human well-being, and (b) how 
human communities support sustainable and productive marine ecosystems.  The MAFF contribution is 
from the ODA (Official Development Assistance) Fund and, therefore, involvement of developing Pacific 
Rim countries in activities is required under this project. 
 
First Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
102 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
 
The project lifetime is 5 years: it began in April 2012, with the ending date set as March 31, 2017.  The 
budget allocated for Year 1 (FY 2012: April 1, 2012 – March 31, 2013) was $149,880, and the initial 
budget breakdown is shown in the following table: 
Travel and 
meetings Contracts Equipment Miscellaneous Overhead Total 
60,000 49,000 19,600 1,796 19,484 149,880 
It was noted that the proposed goals of the project are very general and need to be made much more 
specific.  Aspects of capacity building and the provision of analytical tools should be included and stated 
explicitly.  Both of these (capacity building and tools) should continue to be useful after the project has 
been completed.  When organizing capacity building workshops/courses, the objectives should include the 
needs and goals of a developing country and its partnering institutions. 
The “must do” things under the project include to: 
1. Select 3 study sites:  Southeast Asia, Pacific oceanic islands and Central America; 
2. Conduct research on ecosystem health and human well-being; 
3. Organize 2–3 workshops/courses at each site; 
4. Construct a ‘database’; 
5. Submit annual reports to MAFF/JFA within 120 days after the close of each project year ending 
March 31. 
It was suggested that the ‘database’ could be a bibliography, for example, of interactions within human-
natural systems and related references that would be useful for research and capacity building activities.  
It would be desirable for this database to support the work of the PICES FUTURE science program, and 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports First Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 103 
to link with the work of PICES Working Group on Development of Ecosystem Indicators to Characterize 
Ecosystem Responses to Multiple Stressors (WG 28) on indicators of ecosystem responses to multiple 
stressors regarding human activities (and their related indicators) that affect the ocean. 
It would also be desirable for the project to build on and learn from existing efforts, e.g., NOAA’s 
international activities to teach Integrated Ecosystem Analysis approaches in the South Pacific. 
Action:  Dr. Vera Trainer to provide contact information for these NOAA activities. 
The work of this project should be integrated with other PICES activities and expert groups, such as: 
 FUTURE Research Theme 3 on “How do human activities affect coastal ecosystems and how are 
societies affected by changes in these ecosystems”; 
 Section on Human Dimensions of Marine Systems (S-HD); 
 Section on Ecology of Harmful Algal Blooms in the North Pacific (S-HAB); 
 Section on Climate Change Effects on Marine Ecosystems (S-CCME); 
 WG 28 on Development of Ecosystem Indicators to Characterize Ecosystem Responses to Multiple 
Stressors; 
 WG 21 on Non-indigenous Aquatic Species; 
 WG 29 on Regional Climate Modeling. 
REVIEW OF WORK RELATED TO THE PROJECT 
Dr. Vera Trainer described the HAB (harmful algal bloom) component of the previous MAFF-funded 
project (2007–2012) on teaching country-specific training courses most required to ensure seafood safety 
in the Pacific Rim developing countries outside the PICES region (Philippines, Indonesia, and 
Guatemala).  It had the following features: 
 A survey sent through the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Committee of UNESCO (IOC) to 
appropriate national representatives regarding their perception of needs for HAB monitoring in their 
country (see Appendix 3 for a sample survey form); 
 A follow-up scoping meeting with representatives of agencies in each country selected for training 
courses and workshops, to refine their needs and goals for training; 
 A regional workshop/course organized and conducted in collaboration with local partners; 
 A follow-up meeting with the national representatives, to assess the outcomes from the training 
courses and workshops. 
Dr. Trainer expressed her view that teaching the ‘philosophy of how to do the work’ approach was better 
than teaching a specific issue, so that the participants can have the tools to apply to issues as they emerge 
rather than fix on a set of specific problems.  In addition, it is important that the trainees include those 
people who are actually doing the work. 
Dr. Thomas Therriault commented that the PICES WG 21 on Non-indigenous Aquatic Species took a 
different approach to their 2007–2012 MAFF-funded project.  They decided that the issues to be 
First Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
104 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
addressed regarding invasive species were already well-defined and focused their work on developing a 
database of where invasive species have been observed. 
Dr. Keith Criddle noted that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has 
developed a training course on ecosystem-based management for fisheries and suggested it could be 
important to identify the spatial scale and scope of their project. 
Action:  Dr. Criddle to follow-up and circulate details on this FAO training course. 
As human well-being is not always understood the same way by all parties, it was agreed that a process of 
getting to the ‘shared objectives’ is necessary for the present PICES/MAFF project.  The following was 
suggested as a possible approach: 
1. The PST selects the countries, and then develops a process and questionnaire for circulating to 
selected contacts in each country in order to identify the specific issue to be addressed, within the 
context of marine ecosystem health and human well-being (i.e., specific issues within this topic may 
differ among countries). 
2. The project adopts a ‘responsible template’ approach, in which the national representatives define 
their critical issues, and the PST members help with those issues for which the team has expertise. 
3. It was recommended to start with broad objectives within the context of marine ecosystem health and 
human well-being, then let the national participants define/identify their critical issues within these 
broad objectives, on which subsequent training courses and workshops would focus. 
This process requires a clear sense of who the target participants are for what type of training.  For 
example, an important difference between the present project and the 2007–2012 PICES/MAFF project is 
that the previous one had a very specific training topic related to human and environmental health.  The 
participants at the training workshops were identified as those people who conduct the marine monitoring 
activities, in particular the laboratory personnel.  In contrast, the present project is concerned more with 
conceptual issues of marine ecosystem health and human well-being.  The target participants in such a 
topic may include representatives of local, regional and/or national government agencies responsible for 
marine management and representatives of local community groups in marine-dependent communities. 
Ms. Juri Hori and Dr. Makino presented definitions for human well-being from psychological research: 
“Well-being is a state of being with others and the natural environment which arises where human needs 
are met, where individuals and groups can act meaningfully to pursue their goals, and where they are 
satisfied with their way of life” (Gough et al. 2007).  They described the concept of the “well-being cube”, 
in which a person (or community, region, or country) can be located in one or more of 27 cells defined by 
three axes each with three categories: 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports First Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 105 
 
The survey discussed above could be used to complete this “cube” analysis for each country, thereby 
serving as a standard method to compare countries with respect to their needs for marine ecosystem 
health and human well-being.  In addition, this method might be used to compare the responses of the 
workshop participants to the responses of the broader population from which the participants are drawn, 
and also, how does the region or community compare with country as a whole.  In discussion, it was 
noted that multiple tools may then be needed to link human well-being analyzed by this method with the 
necessary ecosystem services. 
Action:  Ms. Hori and Dr. Makino to prepare a model example to illustrate how this approach might work, 
and the types of questions that might be developed.  This example could include illustrations of how the 
“well-being cube” analysis links with ecosystem services. 
SITE SELECTION 
Three countries were discussed for potential training: 
 Indonesia:  large population, aquaculture-intensive; 
 Palau:  finfish capture fishery focus, existing networks of community-based fisheries; 
 Guatemala:  upwelling system, finfish and aquaculture. 
Possible training workshop/course time schedule for these countries: 
Year 1: Indonesia 
Year 2: Indonesia and Guatemala 
Year 3: Guatemala and Palau 
Year 4: Palau and Indonesia 
Year 5: final synthesis workshop 
In addition, the selection of an appropriate site within each country has to be considered, in consultation 
with the national representatives.  Is more than one site per country needed? 
Dr. Harold Batchelder indicated that he has a student working on modeling of Meso-American reef 
systems, and so he keeps track of some issues on those systems.  There is a website 
(http://www.healthyreefs.org/ images/pdf/conceptual_framework.pdf) that shows a conceptual framework 
for those systems, which includes “social well-being”, which seems synonymous with “human well-being” 
as described by Hori and Makino.  The website has several reports that summarize the condition of Meso-
First Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
106 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
American reef systems, and it might be worth exploring these and other similar sites.  There is also prior 
work on “Coastal systems and human well-being”, and the PST should learn from these efforts. 
The reasons for selecting tropical countries as case studies need to be presented and proved to PICES 
member countries.  For example, ENSO processes connect the tropics with PICES member countries at 
higher latitudes, as does food supply (shrimp and tuna from tropical countries are major imports to PICES 
member countries). 
Action:  Dr. Suam Kim to provide Dr. Makino with information on Dr. Sung Yun Hong as a possible 
contact in Indonesia, and Dr. Trainer to consider leading the program in Guatemala. 
WHAT TOOLS CAN PICES PROVIDE? 
Within the contexts of sustainable human communities and productive marine ecosystems: 
 What are the general concepts leading to sustainable human communities and productive marine 
ecosystems? 
 Where do countries ‘want’ to be within these concepts and where are they now? 
 What are the major stresses (for example climate change) and how might these affect the current state 
and the transitions to the desired state? 
 How does human well-being relate to ecosystem services in these countries? 
The PST agreed to consider if a reduction of all potential activities to one, for example aquaculture, or a 
few activities may help to focus the discussions and training.  The initial survey approach and first 
scoping meeting could be used to identify the larger suite of activities of interest, and if they can be 
reduced to a smaller number of key activities. 
Key outcome: Provide an approach and tools to doing these types of ‘integrated social-ecological 
assessments’. 
NEXT STEPS 
By February 2013: 
 Select specific objectives and approach for this project; 
 Refine “well-being cube” example; 
 Set-up a project website for PST members; 
 Prepare a draft questionnaire for Indonesia, including identification of potential target participants; 
 Identify contacts and conduct the first scoping meeting with appropriate representatives in Indonesia. 
By May 2013: 
 Discuss details of a workshop in Indonesia at a PST meeting to be held, possibly, in conjunction with 
the PICES inter-sessional Science Board meeting (Kaliningrad or St. Petersburg, Russia, week of 
May 20, 2013), or independently of this inter-sessional meeting, for example, in Hawaii in May 2013.

Second Meeting of the Project Science Team 
June 10–12, 2013, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA 
The second meeting of the Project Science Team (PST) for the PICES project on “Marine Ecosystem 
Health and Human Well-Being”, funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) of 
Japan, through the Fisheries Agency of Japan (JFA), was held June 10–12, 2013, in Honolulu, Hawaii, 
USA.  The meeting was co-chaired by Drs. Mitsutaku Makino (Japan) and Ian Perry (Canada). 
The meeting participants are identified in Appendix 1, and the meeting agenda is presented in Appendix 2. 
Day 1 – June 10, 2013 
The first day of the meeting was devoted to presentations and discussions of project activities and 
achievements to date.  The project’s objective was reiterated as to identify the relationships between 
sustainable human communities and sustainable marine ecosystems in the North Pacific, under the 
concept of fishery social-ecological systems.  Specifically, considering that global changes are affecting 
both climate and human social and economic conditions, the project is expected to determine: a) how 
marine ecosystems support human well-being, and b) how human communities support sustainable and 
productive marine ecosystems. 
PRINCE’S TRUST WORKSHOP 
The International Sustainability Unit (ISU) of the UK Prince Charles’ Charitable Foundation has a marine 
program (http://www.pcfisu.org/marine-programme) which, among other objectives, was initiated to help 
strengthen consensus around the best solutions for the sustainable management of wild marine fish 
stocks.  Recently, the ISU released a report based on interviews with fishing communities from 50 
different fisheries around the world about the benefits they are experiencing from managing their fisheries 
more sustainably.  The report demonstrates the possibilities for more sustainable management through 
what is already being achieved (http://pcfisu.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/TPC1224-Princes-Charities-
case-studies-report_WEB-29-03.pdf).  The ISU is now developing a project to implement Fisheries 
Management Plans (FMP) and Transition Financing, and is considering Vietnam and Central America as 
primary locations.  In this regard, the ISU organized a regional workshop on “The opportunities of 
sustainable fisheries in Vietnam: Identifying the transition pathway” (October 30–31, 2012, Nha Trang, 
Vietnam), which was co-sponsored by PICES (through the PICES/MAFF project).  Although a useful 
meeting, it turned out to be somewhat off the main topic of our project.  It was recommended that the 
project be informed of developments within the ISU but, at this stage, not to actively participate. 
RESULTS OF THE TWO INDONESIA WORKSHOPS 
The planning meeting for this case study was held January 22–23, 2013, in Jakarta, at the Headquarters of 
BPPT (Badan Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknologi; the Agency for the Assessment and Application of 
Technology), which is a non-departmental government agency under the coordination of the Ministry of 
Research and Technology responsible for carrying out government duties in the field of assessment and 
application of technology.  Drs. Mitsutaku Makino, Masahito Hirota and Mark Wells participated on 
behalf of PICES; the Indonesian counterpart was Prof. Suhendar Sachoemar.  The objectives of this 
Second Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
112 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
meeting were to understand the local needs, to prepare the draft agenda of the first Indonesia workshop to 
be held in March of 2013, and to develop plans for this case study through to 2017 (the PICES/MAFF 
project period). 
Local needs were well-defined by local authorities.  Many coastal mangroves were cut for the development 
of shrimp aquaculture in the 1990s, causing much erosion (in one location on the north coast of Java, 
three kilometers of coastline were lost due to this development).  Local government and BPPT started a 
program called “Gapura” based on the “Sato-umi” concept (Fig. 1).  The design stipulates the establishment 
of multi-trophic aquaculture, including tilapia, shrimp, Gracilaria, and green mussel, to be established 
initially in Karawang (Java).  If this is not put into place, there is the danger that the coastal developed 
areas will be eroded.  The current focus is on developing useful products from these aquaculture facilities.  
However, they have not monitored impacts to local systems or environmental quality (nutrients, bacteria, 
phytoplankton).  The federal government would like to scientifically verify this activity, build capacity, 
and then disseminate the concept to other areas of Indonesia. 
 
Fig. 1 Relationships between “Sato-umi” and “Gapura” concepts (from presentation by S. Sachoemar and  
T. Yanagi, PICES/BPPT Workshop, Jakarta, March 13–14, 2013). 
The results from the discussion at the January 2013 meeting were used to plan the first Indonesia training 
workshop, which was held on March 13, 2013, at BPPT Headquarters in Jakarta, with a field trip to the 
site at Karawang on March 14. 
A survey to identify local needs for participation by the PICES/MAFF project was not needed for this 
case of Indonesia, as these needs were already well determined (improve community welfare in north 
coastal Java, rehabilitate the coastal ecosystem; improve infrastructure facilities in this region; increase 
the diversity of fishery products, their value and competitiveness), and the general “Sato-umi” concept 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Second Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 113 
was already known (and translated into local concepts).  In discussion at the workshop, it became clear 
that there were two concepts involved in the implementation of “Sato-umi” in Indonesia: “Gapura”, 
which refers to improved productivity of aquaculture and indicates the pilot study, and “Gempita”, which 
is the broader Indonesian term for “Sato-umi”.  The intent now is to combine “Gapura” and “Gempita”. 
The workshop results were presented by Dr. Makino.  There were a total of 93 participants from Indonesian 
agencies, Japan (FRA and MAFF) and USA.  In attendance for the PICES/MAFF project were  
Drs. Makino, Hirota, Wells, and William Cochlan.  The workshop had a high-profile in Indonesia, with 
the opening address given by the Director of the BPPT Centre for Agriculture Production Technology and 
many reports appearing in newspapers, on TV and the web.  The draft agenda, workshop report, and 
related documents are provided in Appendix 3.  The workshop report and a PICES Press article (Vol. 21, 
No. 2, pp. 18–19) are also available on the project website at http://www.pices.int/projects/marweb. 
There were 6 principal outcomes from the workshop: 
 The meeting itself, and a report; 
 A letter of intent between PICES and BPPT for continued collaborative work on this project; 
 A workshop summary and action plans; 
 A draft content of a manual to assist with spreading these concepts to other coastal areas of Indonesia; 
 A draft experimental protocol for pond experiments; 
 A draft list of parameters to be measured during these pond experiments. 
The second day of workshop was a visit to a local government lab and a national lab in Karawang 
Province.  The PICES participants determined that there is a well-equipped facility to measure a subset of 
required parameters such as bacteria, viruses, oxygen, nutrients, etc.  It was proposed to work with 
Indonesian partners and to conduct pond experiments to examine the natural and human system benefits 
of multi-trophic aquaculture, which would include tilapia, shrimp, Gracilaria, and green mussel.  The list 
of potential parameters to assess is shown in Table 1 in Appendix 3.  Discussion at the present meeting 
suggested that environmental parameters be measured both inside and outside (control) of the ponds in 
order to evaluate impacts external to the ponds. 
The elements for a manual for this project were identified as: 
1. Introduction for the “Gempita” concept 
2. Why we need “Gempita”? 
3. How to introduce “Gempita” (technical how-to)? 
4. How to assess the effectiveness of “Gempita” (scientific how-to)? 
5. Conclusions 
6. Glossary 
Discussion on this topic included the following points: 
 Value of scoping meeting:  In this case the local needs are well-defined; however, an in-person 
meeting with key local contacts was essential to understand local needs and to plan the joint 
workshop. 
Second Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
114 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
 Need for a formal agreement (LOI):  The local partners felt this was important for their internal process. 
 What types of research are expected by PICES:  It is a key point of discussion and outcome from the 
meetings.  In this case it includes formal research plans. 
 Focus of manual appears to be specific to Indonesia (see points below). 
 List of parameters (and link to manual). 
 Experimental pond:  Local and national government were both willing to contribute a pond to this 
effort.   The research is about increasing output rather than decreasing impact.  The shrimp–bivalve–
Gracilaria–mussel system has not been explored previously, although perhaps additional members to 
the PST need to be included with expertise in multi-trophic aquaculture in developing regions.  It was 
noted that, to quantify success, study of the social science aspects need to begin now to provide a 
baseline for assessing whether human well-being has improved.  Such an assessment might include 
increases in product and also the variety of products, such that employment and self-sufficiency of 
the community will increase, and there will be added value.  Dr. Hirota will visit the community to 
assess social aspects. 
There was also discussion as to the type of manuals that might be required.  For example, slightly 
different manuals with differing amounts of detail (different levels of specificity), with some elements 
mixed and matched in all, to meet the needs of different audiences are likely necessary: 
 Community members in Indonesia – 1 page overview, experiments that have been done; 
 Community members in Guatemala – 1 page overview, experiments that have been done; 
 Scientific community (PICES) – a more complete analysis of the approach and outcomes, in the 
context of improving marine ecosystem health and human well-being; perhaps leading to an article in 
the scholarly scientific literature. 
The manuals might include note of things to measure, e.g., with respect to coastal biodiversity, if these 
pond experiments are successful. 
The “lessons learned” from this workshop experience and those of previous MAFF-sponsored projects 
include: 
 Importance of local contacts and scoping meetings in setting the issues and determining what can be 
done.  This also helps with engaging authorities.  Most of this work has to be done in person, not by 
email or Skype, to ensure project objectives fit into the local needs.  It is essential to have a strong 
local contact; 
 Local governments put value in the name of PICES.  This was a good achievement to hold a 
workshop with PICES; 
 Listening is critical; 
 Having a Memorandum of Understanding (Agreement) in place might be required; 
 Press coverage was important.

“WELL-BEING CUBE” ANALYSIS 
Dr. Makino and Ms. Juri Hori presented the concept and initial results from the “well-being cube” 
analysis, as applied to survey conducted in Japan.  “Well-being” is defined by psychology as “involving 
peoples’ positive evaluations of their lives, including positive emotions, engagement, satisfaction, and 
meaning”.  As stated in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005), human well-being (HWB) has 
multiple constituents, such as basic materials for a good life, freedom of choice and action, health, good 
social relations, and security.  The constituents of well-being, as experienced and perceived by people, are 
situation-dependent, reflecting local geography, culture, and ecological circumstances.  These factors are 
complex and value-laden.  In the present study, HWB is defined as peoples’ positive states of being 
satisfied, and freedom of choice and action.  The “well-being cube” approach is being explored as a 
means to connect ecosystem services, human well-being, and freedom of choice and action, and in part to 
understand motivations for these choices and actions (Fig. 2). 
 
Fig. 2 Example of how the human well-being cube concept can relate ecosystem services to human well-being and 
freedom of choice and action (from presentation by J. Hori and M. Makino at the second PST meeting, 
June 10, 2013). 
The HWB cube is composed of a combination of 27-human needs, determined by reference to data from 
previous studies about “human needs”.  It has three dimensions: primitive or reasoning; level of 
interaction/ arousal; and relationships about self and others (Fig. 3).  This approach permits the scientific 
calculation of the relationship between the 4 components of well-being and freedom of choice and action 
(Fig. 4).  This concept was tested using a survey of 1000 individuals in Japan, each of whom was asked a 
set of questions relating to their well-being (Fig. 5).  Preliminary results suggest high importance of good 
social relationships for well-being and freedom of choice among those people who self-identified as 
having high connections with the ocean.

Day 2 – June 11, 2013 
The second day of the meeting was devoted to presentations and discussions of future project activities, 
plans, and budgets. 
INDONESIA CASE STUDY 
The follow-up activities for the Indonesian case study were proposed as: 
1. Pond experiment and capacity-building training (lead by Drs. Wells and Makino); 
2. Community research surveys and human well-being (lead by Drs. Hirota and Makino); 
3. Capacity building – proposal by Dr. Susanna Nurdjaman (Institute of Technology, Bandung), who is a 
former student of Prof. Tetsuo Yanagi); 
4. Second Indonesia workshop. 
Dr. Nurdjaman has submitted a proposal to conduct research related to the project.  Dr. Makino has 
requested that she contact Prof. Sachoemar to determine how her research will be coordinated with BPPT 
and PICES activities (at present there appears to be little connection between what she proposes and the 
experimental pond work).  For example, will her group do modeling or will they actually set up the pond 
and maintain it?  It was recommended that the advantage of the proposal at this time would be in 
modelling some of the initial conditions (e.g., the number of other species to stock, etc.). 
Action:  The PST is generally in favour of this proposal but recommended a limit of $5000 US per year 
for 3 years; the proponent has to be contacted to improve the details of the work to be done and how it 
integrates with this project.  Lead: Dr. Makino. 
It was suggested in discussion that activities in 2013–2014 be focused on development of the pond 
experiments in Karawang (West Java), with the workshop being held in late 2014 or early 2015 to discuss 
and disseminate the initial results.  A training course could be conducted at the start of the pond 
experiments.  This would best be done in February or March of 2014 because this is good timing for the 
shrimp and fish farmers, and BPPT obtains its funding in January.  It is expected that 3–4 PST members 
would participate in this training workshop and pond experimental set-up.  It was noted that, because of the 
limited budget for this project, most of the funding would need to come from BPPT (e.g., for the purchase 
of supplies, in-kind labour, etc.).  Alternative scenarios should be developed in case their funding is 
insufficient for all the planned activities. 
Discussions then turned to how will the social sciences fit in to the pond study, considering the focus of 
this project on marine ecosystems and human well-being?  A “social” baseline is needed before 
conducting the pond experiments to provide a comparison to evaluate whether the increased productivity 
of the ponds plus improved environmental conditions in the vicinity of the ponds have benefitted the local 
community, or whether the benefits have been shifted outside the local community (e.g., to international 
markets).  Are the additional products from such an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture activity 
distributed locally to improve human well-being, and how does this compare with shrimp-only facilities?  
Originally, Dr. Hirota had plans to survey in Indonesia 2–3 times, but this may need to be revised 
considering the recent budget reductions.  The desire is to predict change in profit in the country due to 
multi-trophic aquaculture.  Ideally the surveys would be focused on the multi-trophic aquaculture system:  
what happens to the products, and how the markets change, ultimately with a recommendation provided 
Second Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
118 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
to the government regarding how to establish multi-trophic aquaculture in these environments.  It was 
noted that it may take time (e.g., more than 1 year) for the social benefits of such an integrated multi-
trophic aquaculture (IMTA) enterprise to become fully evident.  A comparative approach to the surveys 
was suggested, for example, using the site with the IMTA experimental ponds and another site with only 
shrimp aquaculture.  The focus would then be on the distribution of any additional benefits from the 
IMTA products and their social benefits. 
Dr. Hirota presented a template of the survey planned for Indonesia.  This survey includes national, 
regional industry and fishing community level questions.  It was noted that the survey questions must be 
developed and presented in a context familiar to and understood by the local people.  In addition, it was 
suggested that Dr. Noer Kasanah (Department of Fisheries, Faculty of Agriculture, University Gadjah 
Mada) might be able to help conduct these social surveys, using her students. 
Action:  Drs. Makino and Hirota to discuss the approach and locations for the social surveys with BPPT 
and to develop options (of how, where, etc.). 
The second Indonesia workshop would draw together the results from the IMTA pond experiments and 
promote expansion of the concept to other areas of Indonesia.  It was recommended to defer this 
workshop to Year 3 (2014–2015).  There is interest on the part of BPPT of having this workshop in a 
different location, for example South Sulawesi, to illustrate and promote the results of this activity 
beyond Karawang,  However, at present there does not seem to be an obvious contact in South Sulawesi.  
The training workshop (suggested for early 2014) could be a possibility to scout for opportunities and 
contact in South Sulawesi, who might be invited to the training workshop. 
GUATEMALA CASE STUDY 
Dr. Vera Trainer presented options for the case study in Guatemala.  She first briefly reviewed the 
activities relating to HAB monitoring that was part of the previous PICES/MAFF project, and then 
proposed the following: 
Project #1 possibility – Ecosystem approach to shrimp aquaculture 
 Nutrient-laden water being pumped into coastline (tourist areas), 
 Interest in making shrimp farms environmentally sustainable, 
 Enhance coordination among farms, 
 Interest in export. 
Project #2 possibility – Marine finfish aquaculture 
 Strong interest in Guatemala, 
 Efforts have failed to date because of lack of efforts to grow from fingerlings, 
 University of Guatemala interest, 
 A key objective would be to get fishermen involved in aquaculture – common wholesaler, better price, 
 Potential fish species: gar (“ugly” fish, lack of market interest) and tilapia (current prices are not good). 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Second Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 119 
The need for a site visit, possibly in January 2014, was noted, likely using Dr. Leonel Carrillo Ovalle 
(University of San Carlos, Guatemala City) as an initial local contact considering the excellent 
relationships that have developed from the previous PICES/MAFF project.  In discussion, the PST 
expressed a preference for the Project #1 option (shrimp aquaculture issues) as it appeared to match better 
the plans that are being developed for Indonesia.  A Guatemala case study could be built around issues of 
improving coastal water quality near shrimp farms, and the opportunities to use IMTA products for local 
consumption. 
The following needs were identified: 
 Social scientist link – for example, Dr. Charles Trick has extensive experience in social science 
studies in developing nations and is interested in participating in the PICES/MAFF Guatemala effort; 
 Locations of coastal shrimp farms; 
 Determine target sites for a preliminary visit; 
 Determine budget (travel for Guatemalan scientists, translation assistance, supplies?) 
The proposal is for an initial scouting visit in January 2014, followed by a workshop later in the year.  
Discussion also indicated an opportunity for the “people” side and the human well-being aspects to be 
related to advancing the resilience of local communities and peoples.  Dr. McKinnell pointed out that 
there may be an existing project from Spain working on aquaculture training in Guatemala – this needs 
further research and possibly discussion with local colleagues. 
The following were identified as questions to consider in developing the Guatemala case study: 
 Are they most interested in the shrimp aquaculture vs. aquacultured fish project? 
 Would Acuamaya be interested in collaborating in a multi-trophic experiment?  Or any other shrimp 
farmers would be interested?  Would this be an interesting University research project? 
 Would we be able to visit them last week of January and discuss this project? 
 Would government, university, local farmers be interested in the multi-trophic aquaculture issue? 
 Are Tilapia is consumed domestically and shrimp is exported?  Is production of Tilipia economically 
feasible? 
 What are the production amounts and values for shrimp and Tilapia for last several years? 
 What are the kinds of products (filet or whole, frozen or fresh)? 
 What are the number of processing plants and their scale? 
 What is the local use of seafood vs. what is exported? 
 What could be grown for local consumption?  Bivalves, seaweed, etc.  What would the local people eat? 
 Where are the shrimp aquaculture facilities in Guatemala? 
 Where/who are the distributors? 
 Questionnaires for well being survey – would minimum 1000 surveys be possible? 
 What is reasonable reimbursement for 30 min survey in: a. Guatemala City (minimum 500) and b. 
coast (Monterrico) (minimum 500) 
Second Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
120 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
Action:  Dr. Trainer to work over the summer 2013 to develop the opportunities and identify issues 
relating to the Guatemala case study, and to report and provide recommendations for decision at the 
October 2013 PST meeting. 
“WELL-BEING CUBE” FURTHER ACTIVITIES 
Activities regarding the “well-being cube” project over the next year were discussed.  The survey in Japan 
was conducted in 2012.  The next countries to be surveyed (to start in July 2013) are Korea and the 
United States.  To improve the results with respect to the well-being of people connected in some way to 
the ocean, it was recommended to focus these surveys on locations closer to the ocean (e.g., the five US 
states along the Pacific coast) rather than nationwide.  Dr. Suam Kim asked for the survey questions to be 
circulated to the PST once they have been translated into English and Korean.  Surveys in 2014 could 
consider Indonesia and Guatemala to converge with the IMTA experiments, although it was noted that 
different methods may be needed because of lack of internet access. 
Action:  Ms. Hori to circulate “well-being cube” survey questions to PST members once they are 
available in English and Korean. 
DATABASE ACTIVITY 
Production of a database from this project is one of the deliverables to MAFF.  The PST discussed what 
form this database might take, considering how the project is evolving.  The database could: 
 Be a bibliography, for example of publications relating to marine ecosystems and human well-being, 
Sato-umi, Gempita, and related concepts; 
 Link with data from previous PICES/MAFF projects; 
 Store the individual responses from the “well-being cube” surveys; 
 Store the techniques and tools, and results, developed from the Indonesia and Guatemala case studies 
and their manuals. 
PALAU CASE STUDY 
Considering the expected budget reductions (see below) one option is to cancel the Palau case study.  
Another option is to keep it ‘in reserve’ in case one of the leading projects (Indonesia, Guatemala) does 
not work out.  It was recommended to retain the option of conducting a Palau case study but at the 
moment provide a null budget, and to make clear in the reporting to PICES and MAFF that it may not be 
continued depending on the future budget situation. 
Day 3 – June 12, 2013 
BUDGET 
The budget situation was discussed, including the impacts of the current and expected future budget 
reductions.  The 2013–2014 draft planning budget (including expenses rolled over from 2012–2013) is 
presented in Table 1.

OTHER ISSUES 
Project name 
A more convenient name for the project is desirable.  Suggestions to date include: POWER (People and 
Ocean Wellness, and Ecosystem Response), Ecopond, MarWeB (Marine Ecosystem Health and Human 
Well-Being).  Other recommendations are needed. 
Action:  All PST members to suggest short names for this project, or to express their preference for 
existing recommendations. 
Session proposal for PICES-2014 
With the evolution of the project towards a focus on integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, it would be 
beneficial to sponsor a scientific session at the 2014 PICES Annual Meeting (to be held in a Korea) that 
would present scientific issues and opportunities relating to his topic, in particular with a focus on 
developing countries in the lower latitudes.  The deadline for session proposals is in early September 2013. 
Action:  Drs. Makino and Perry to lead development of a session proposal on integrated multi-trophic 
aquaculture (with a focus on developing countries) for submission in September 2013. 
PST membership review 
With the evolution of a focus for the project on IMTA, it is timely to conduct a review of the PST 
membership, to see if there is needed expertise currently not on the PST, and if any Team members might 
wish to step off.  For example, it was suggested that an expert on multi-trophic aquaculture, in particular 
with developing country experience, would be an asset on the PST. 
Action:  All PST members to express whether they wish to remain on the PST and are interested to 
participate in the current activities as they are presently evolving. 
Project web page 
This PICES/MAFF project needs to develop its own web page on the PICES website.  Materials are 
required from the PST to populate this page. 
Action:  All PST members to provide materials for the project page on the PICES website. 
Next PST meeting 
Items for the agenda for the next PST meeting were identified as: 
 Report on discussions and development of the Guatemala case study (Trainer); 
 Update on plans for the Indonesia case study and pond experiments (Makino, Hirota, Wells); 
 Early results from the analyses of the “well-being cube” surveys in Japan, USA, Korea (Hori, Makino); 
 Report on the Japanese visit to Palau (Makino); 
 Decision needed on the use of project funds to support computer upgrades in the Secretariat; 
 Develop a project timeline (meetings, field visits, field programs, etc.).

RECOMMENDATIONS/ACTION ITEMS 
 Project should maintain contact with the International Sustainability Unit (ISU) of the UK Prince 
Charles’ Charitable Foundation to see what collaboration may be possible. 
 Propose integration with aquaculture group and its role in promoting human well-being (Topic 
Session at the 2014 PICES Annual Meeting in Korea?) 
 Manual should have a general background on Sato-umi, then two case studies (Indonesia and 
Guatemala).  We may need manuals targeted for different audiences with different levels of specificity. 
 Drs. Kim and Makino suggest developing a brochure for the general public. 
 Publication in the scientific literature regarding multi-trophic aquaculture, especially if there is 
commonality between Indonesia and Guatemala (possibly in the journal Ecology and Society, Dr. 
Perry is an editor). 
 Modify questions for “well-being cube” analysis to make them more understandable in developing 
nation without changing content (Ms. Hori and Drs. Makino, Trainer and Wells). 
 Provide well-being survey to show to Indonesian and Guatemalan collaborators (July 1, English 
version sent by Ms. Hori to Drs. Makino, Trainer and Wells) – include sending the Korean version to 
Dr. Kim. 
 Discuss social survey logistics with BPPT collaborators (Drs. Makino, Hirota and Wells) and Dr. 
Kasanah at University Gadjah Mada (Dr. Hirota) and Dr. Carrillo Ovalle in Guatemala (Dr. Trainer). 
 Contact Indonesia (Prof. Sachoemar) about their commitment to providing in-kind support for the 
experimental ponds (Drs. Makino and Wells). 
 Develop over next year an agreement with Prof. Sachoemar on research cooperation (Drs. Makino and 
Wells). 
 Contact Dr. Nurdjaman to determine what is covered in her proposal.  What will she be able to 
contribute to the overall PICES/MAFF project.  Is the $5000 an annual cost?  What is included in 
this? (Dr. Makino). 
 Find an expert in multi-trophic aquaculture to add to the PST (Drs. Wells and Makino). 
 Explore a contact in South Sulawesi during Year 2 for planning a second workshop in Year 3 (Dr. 
Wells). 
 Contact Guatemala with ‘general’ questions regarding this project (Dr. Trainer). 
 Reporting: Co-chairs to prepare reports for PICES (and MAFF) on project development and 
activities, 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 budgets – due “NOW”. 
 Development of session/workshop proposal for PICES-2014 (Drs. Perry and Makino). 
 More information/clarification needed on additional contributions from the Secretariat to the project, 
in terms of financial requirements (Drs. Makino and Perry).

Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Second Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 129 
Report of the International Workshop Organized by PICES/MAFF Project on  
“Marine Ecosystem Health and Human Well-Being” 
1. BACKGROUND 
In 2012, PICES started a project “Marine ecosystem health and human well-being”, funded by the 
Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (MAFF) for 5 years (April 1, 2012 – March 31, 
2017).  The overall goal of the project is to identify the relationships between sustainable human 
communities and productive marine ecosystems in the North Pacific under the concept of fishery social–
ecological systems (known in Japan as the “Sato-umi” fisheries management system).  Specifically, 
considering the global changes in climate and human social and economic conditions, it aims is to 
determine: a) how do marine ecosystems support human well-being? and b) how do human communities 
support sustainable and productive marine ecosystems?  The principal investigators of this project are Drs. 
Mitsutaku Makino (Japan) and Ian Perry (Canada) whose activities are supported and consulted by the 
Project Science Team (PST). 
Based on the decisions made at the first PST meeting (October 11, 2012, Hiroshima, Japan), the 
PICES/MAFF project is expected to include holding two workshops in developing countries in three 
regions of the North Pacific (Southeast Asia, Pacific oceanic islands, and Central America).  Indonesia 
was selected because of its large population and aquaculture-intensive industry.  Palau was chosen 
because of its focus on the finfish capture fishery and its existing networks of community-based fisheries).  
Guatemala was selected because its coastline features an upwelling system favorable for the finfish 
fishery and aquaculture).  This report is on the first Indonesia workshop held March 13–14, 2013. 
2. GEMPITA-SPL CONCEPT IN INDONESIA 
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) has developed a 
concept of managing coastal and marine resources by actively involving the community.  This Indonesian 
concept is called GEMPITA-SPL (Gerakkan Masyarakat Peduli Kelestarian Sumberdaya Perikanan, 
Pesisir dan Laut) or, in the English language version, as SFiCoMS (Sustainable Utilization of Fisheries, 
Coastal and Marine Resources for the Society).  The GEMPITA-SPL or SFiCoMS concept has been 
implemented in the northern coastal area of Java Development Activities in West Java (GAPURA) by 
BPPT and the local Department of Fisheries and Marine Affairs through the development and promotion 
of environmentally friendly aquaculture technology called Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA).  
This approach features concepts of bio-recycling in idle and/or marginal brackish water ponds of the 
northern coastal area of West Java.  By applying this concept, the coastal environment which has been 
heavily damaged by shrimp monoculture can be recovered to become more biodiverse and productive, 
leading to the improved welfare of local communities.  The GEMPITA-SPL concept fits very well within 
the framework of fishery social-ecological systems (SES) in the PICES/MAFF Project. 
3.  OUTLINE OF THE WORKSHOP 
The first PICES/MAFF project workshop was held March 13–14, 2013, in Jakarta, Indonesia.  The 
workshop was attended by 93 participants from Indonesia, Japan, and the USA.  Indonesia was 
represented by the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, Ministry of Research and Technology, 
Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Public Works, Coordinating Ministry for the Economy, Finance and 
Industry, Coordinating Ministry for People’s Welfare, Ministry of Development of Disadvantaged Areas, 
Second Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
130 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
Ministry for National Development Planning, Food Security Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Bandung Institute of Technology, Bogor Agriculture University, and local governments. 
The objectives of the workshop were to: 
1. Develop the contents of a manual that will describe GEMPITA-SPL/SFiCoMS  and GAPURA 
experiences in Java Province according to local conditions at some candidate sites; 
2. Assess the utility of PICES’ scientific tools for enhancing the human well-being of local 
communities and for rehabilitating coastal ecosystem at some candidate sites. 
The first day of the workshop took place at the Main Commission Hall of BPPT’s Headquarters in Jakarta.  
It started with a welcome by Ms. Nenie Yustiningsih (Director of the Center for Agricultural Production 
Technology of BPPT), followed by opening remarks and introduction by Dr. Makino (Fig. 1).  The 
keynote speech was delivered by Professor Tetsuo Yanagi (Kyushu University, Japan).  The opening of 
the workshop was formally announced by Dr. Listyani Wijayanti (Deputy Chairman of BPPT).  A total of 
10 presentations were given on the first day.  Dr. Mark Wells (University of Maine, USA; Fig. 2) 
described previous activities of PICES in Indonesia and suggested ways that PICES science can support 
GEMPITA-SPL.  Dr. Masahito Hirota (National Research Institute of Fisheries Science, Fisheries 
Research Agency, Japan) talked about how PICES scientific tools can support the analysis of well-being 
in coastal societies. 
The second day featured a field trip to the Karawan area of West Java where BPPT has developed 
GEMPITA-SPL (Fig. 3).  Participants visited the Center for Brackishwater and Marine Culture of West 
Java Province and the National Center for Brackishwater Aquaculture to observe aquaculture ponds that 
applied the GEMPITA-SPL approach, and had discussions with local stakeholders (fishers, managers, etc.).

4. THE MAIN OUTPUTS FROM THE WORKSHOP AND THE NEXT STEPS OF THE PICES/MAFF 
PROJECT 
Many important outcomes have come from the workshop (March 13–14) and from discussions held the 
next day (March 15).  The first outcome was a Letter of Intent (LOI; Appendix 1) between PICES and 
BPPT to recognize the benefits to their respective institutions of establishing an international link.  The 
second outcome was a draft list of parameters to evaluate GEMPITA-SPL performance (Table 1).  In 
close coordination with Indonesian scientists, PICES scientists will support the assessment of these 
parameters in sample ponds where GEMPITA-SPL has been implemented.  A third outcome was a table 
of contents developed for a manual to facilitate the dissemination of GEMPITA-SPL activities in 
Indonesia (Table 2).  These main outcomes will be discussed at the second PST meeting to be held June 
11–12, 2013, in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.  Based on the advice and comments from this meeting, the 
second Indonesia workshop will be held in March 2014. 
In addition to this Indonesian case study, the PICES/MAFF project will initiate activities in Guatemala in 
2013, and in Palau in 2014.  A progress report on these areas will be provided soon.

Third Meeting of the Project Science Team 
October 10, 2013, Nanaimo, Canada 
The third meeting of the Project Science Team (PST) for the PICES/MAFF project on “Marine 
Ecosystem Health and Human Well-Being” (MarWeB), funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan, through the Fisheries Agency of Japan (JFA), was held October 10, 2013, in 
conjunction with the PICES Annual Meeting in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada.  The meeting was co-
chaired by Drs. Mitsutaku Makino (Japan) and Ian Perry (Canada). 
The objective for this meeting was to review progress since the second PST meeting (June 10–12, 2013, 
Honolulu, USA), specifically: 
 Planning for the Indonesia and Guatemala case studies, 
 Advances in the “well-being cube” analysis, 
 Development of a workplan for 2014–2015. 
The PST members and meeting participants are identified in Appendix 1. 
1. ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA 
The provisional agenda circulated prior to the meeting was adopted without changes (Appendix 2). 
2. INTRODUCTION OF THE PROJECT 
Progress is being made internationally on an ecosystem approach to the management of marine systems.  
Very recently, the concept of human well-being within marine social-ecological systems has become 
recognized as an important step forward.  Well-being shifts the perspective from objective measures of 
sustainable livelihoods (comprised of the physical, social, human, natural, and financial resources 
available to a community or country) to include the subjective or perceived well-being of individuals and 
communities.  This represents a shift from people as exploiters of the ocean to people as integral 
components of resource sustainability and ecosystem health (Coulthard et al. 2011, Global Environmental 
Change, 21: 453–463; Charles 2012, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 4: 351–357).  The 
Japanese concept of “Sato-umi” (village–sea) is one version of this humans-in-nature approach, in which 
a healthy ecosystem is seen to nourish human well-being, but human activities are seen as necessary for 
sustaining ecosystem health. (e.g., United Nations University Institute of Advanced Studies Operating 
Unit Ishikawa/Kanazawa (2011); Biological and Cultural Diversity in Coastal Communities, Exploring 
the Potential of Sato-umi for Implementing the Ecosystem Approach in the Japanese Archipelago.  
Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Montreal, Technical Series no. 61).  Therefore, this 
project is proposed and funded by the government of Japan.  The project lifespan is 5 years, with the 
ending date set as March 31, 2017. 
The goal of this project is to identify the relationships between sustainable human communities and 
productive marine ecosystems in the North Pacific, under the concept of fishery social-ecological systems.  
In particular, considering that global changes are affecting both climate and human social and economic 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Third Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 139 
conditions, the project is expected to determine: (a) how marine ecosystems support human well-being, 
and (b) how human communities support sustainable and productive marine ecosystems. 
The project should be integrated with other PICES activities and expert groups such as: 
 FUTURE Research Theme 3 on “How do human activities affect coastal ecosystems and how are 
societies affected by changes in these ecosystems?”; 
 Section on Human Dimensions of Marine Systems (S-HD); 
 Section on Ecology of Harmful Algal Blooms in the North Pacific (S-HAB); 
 Section on Climate Change Effects on Marine Ecosystems (S-CCME); 
 WG 28 on Development of Ecosystem Indicators to Characterize Ecosystem Responses to Multiple 
Stressors; 
 WG 21 on Non-indigenous Aquatic Species. 
Major activities to date include: 
 First PST meeting in conjunction with PICES-2012 (October 11, 2012, Hiroshima, Japan,); 
 Scoping meeting (January 23–23, 2013) and first Indonesia workshop (March 13–14, 2013, Jakarta 
and Karawang, Indonesia); 
 Second PST meeting (June 10–12, 2013, Honolulu, USA); 
 Social survey scoping meeting (October 2–3, 2013, Jakarta, Indonesia); 
 Progress and financial reports for Year 1 (FY 2012: April 1, 2012 – March 31, 2013) submitted to MAFF; 
 Two articles in PICES Press newsletter: Vol. 21, No. 1 (winter 2013) and Vol. 21, No. 2 (summer 2013). 
3. PROGRESS REPORTS 
3.1 Annual Reports for Science Board and MAFF 
The progress and financial reports for Year 1 (FY 2012: April 1, 2012 – March 31, 2013), accepted by 
MAFF/JFA, are posted on the project website (http://www.pices.int/projects/marweb). 
3.2 Results of the second PST meeting 
The report from the second PST meeting (June 10–12, 2013, Honolulu, USA) is available on the project 
website (http://www.pices.int/projects/marweb). 
3.3 Pond experiments and research plan in Karawang, Indonesia 
Plans are progressing for a pond experiment in Indonesia.  Three potential options with different focal 
species were presented (with their anticipated project costs) and discussed: 
 Fish–seaweed–bivalves ($27,000); 
 Shrimp–seaweed–bivalves ($30,000); 
 Milk fish–crabs–bivalves ($17,000). 
Third Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
140 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
Overall, it was felt the total costs were too high, and beyond the project (shrinking) budget.  Dr. Mark 
Wells suggested that the extent of work needed to be trimmed to better match the budget available for this 
work in Year 2 (about $43,000). 
3.4 Plans for social science research in Indonesia related to the project 
1. Dr. Masahito Hirota reported how multiple use of the products from marine activities (multi-utility: 
processing of multiple species by the same people) provides welfare and benefits for people’s 
livelihoods in the fishing areas (Fig. 1). 
2. In Karawang, Indonesia, shrimp aquaculture expanded from 2002 to 2009, but subsequently 
collapsed due to degradation of the ecosystem.  Local consumption should be encouraged rather than 
relying on exports, but the question remains how local consumption can be “regulated”. 
3. A social survey scoping meeting with fishers, traders, wholesalers and processors took place October 
2–3, 2013, involving: (a) mapping of commodity chains (Fig. 2), (b) confirmation of a checklist and 
guideline for field work (see discussion from the second PST meeting at 
http://meetings.pices.int/projects/marweb); (c) what can be done to assist the “well-being cube” 
analysis, and (d) confirmation of data items. 
4. Shrimp have normally been used for the export market only, whereas in multi-trophic aquaculture 
and livelihood contexts, other products (seaweed and bivalves) could be used locally.  Traditionally, 
the export-oriented shrimp monoculture activities do not contribute seafood protein to the local 
community, but integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) might. 
5. A milk fish experiment and shrimp experiment would provide a nice contrast of local (milk fish) vs 
export (shrimp) market commodities. 
6. Which bivalves should be included in the pond experiments?  At present, there is no market for 
bivalves because of general fears of Vibrio and other infections/diseases.  Therefore, there is some 
uncertainty about the acceptability of bivalves to the local market.  Gracilaria (algae) is consumed 
primarily for agar.  There is a benefit to using the system that directly benefits the food (diet) of the 
local people. 
The PST was informed that Indonesia (BPPT) would like a more formal agreement with PICES, similar 
to that signed between Guatemala (University of San Carlos) and PICES for the 2007–2012 MAFF-
funded project on the “Development of the prevention systems for harmful organisms’ expansion in the 
Pacific Rim”.  This needs to be discussed with the PICES Secretariat. 
3.5 Plans for research activities and workshops in Guatemala 
1. Dr. Vera Trainer reported on conversations with Guatemalan colleagues, Lic. Leonel Carrillo and Lic. 
Carolina Marroquin (University of San Carlos, Guatemala City). 
2. Fisheries export is among the top 25 exported goods in Guatemala, increasing by about 6% from 
2010 to 2011 (which is small relative to other exported products).

3. Fish, shellfish and seafood generally are too expensive for locals, except for the very wealthy.  The 
majority of these products are exported.  However, shrimp are sold fresh in markets and frozen in 
supermarkets.  Products sold domestically are bought by intermediates who then re-sell them in 
terminal markets.  Distributors sell to final consumers or door-to-door.  Some small-scale fish 
mariculture projects have been tried, but have not progressed. 
4. Shrimp aquaculture: Previously, large shrimp were cultured, but in last 6 years small-scale shrimp 
producers have generated about 2.5 million pounds ($8M/yr) – a 25% increase in last 3–5 years.  
Typically, culture activities start in February–March, grow during the warm period, reach a certain 
size, and then are harvested for domestic consumption. 
5. Locals would prefer marine finfish and bivalves.  They do not eat seaweeds.  There likely needs to be 
an economic benefit to growing seaweeds because the population is generally very poor.  It was noted 
that Dr. Thierry Chopin (seaweed expert from Canada’s East Coast) is working on using seaweeds to 
capture excess nutrients in aquaculture operations.  However, this is technologically difficult.  The 
initial goal is to use seaweeds for bioremediation in these culture operations.  In multi-trophic 
aquaculture bivalves must be cultured immediately adjacent to finfish; it has been observed that 
bivalves may grow faster in IMTA settings. 
6. Shrimp culture in Indonesia is done in brackishwater ponds, with nutrient-laden water pumped into 
coastal waters.  In Guatemala, there is interest in making shrimp farms environmentally sustainable, 
enhancing coordination among farms, and in exports. 
7. Two possible projects were presented and discussed: 
Project #1 – Ecosystem approach to shrimp aquaculture 
 Nutrient-laden water being pumped into coastline (tourist areas); 
 Interest in making shrimp farms environmentally sustainable; 
 Enhancing coordination among farms; 
 Interest in exporting. 
Project #2 – Marine finfish aquaculture 
 Efforts have failed to date because of no attempts have been made to grow from fingerlings; 
 Fishers need to become involved in aquaculture – using a common wholesaler gets a better price; 
 Prices have not been good for fish species considered not ‘attractive’, literally for Gar (an “ugly 
fish”), and for Tilapia. 
 Fish aquaculture would be the best option to improve food security and give coastal residents a 
way to improve their income, whereas shrimp aquaculture would be the best option to promote 
aquaculture, create jobs and promote small- to mid-sized companies. 
8. A social scientist from Guatemala, who has experience in how Tilapia production might influence 
development, suggested that, at a cost of $50/day, social science questionnaires could be given by 
students in coastal communities.  To obtain 1000 surveys, many small communities would need to be 
visited.  Note that the coastal area is very narrow – approximately 10 km from the sea is considered 
the maximum distance for marine influences.  Participants could request supplies for their town, such 
as children’s books for the library, trash cans for the beach, supplies for school, etc. instead of 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Third Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 143 
payment.  However, an outreach activity would need to be conducted first to explain the benefits of 
this project to the community. 
9. Dr. Trainer’s impressions of starting a project: 
 The University of San Carlos is very interested in a multi-trophic aquaculture project; 
 The focus should be on small shrimp farms (~3) as model systems; 
 Visit those farms during the scouting mission; 
 Work with small shrimp farms to develop bivalve or Tilapia culture;  these would be primarily 
for domestic consumption; 
 Bivalve culture will have to consider pollutants and bacteria (wastewater is contaminated); 
 Consider using seaweed for fertilizer or oil; 
 Shellfish culture is mostly on sand substrate, with little seed.  The Japanese have supplied oyster 
seed in El Salvador, which has worked well.  Can we find these Japanese contacts for 
Guatemala? 
 It is difficult to keeping people interested in the long term, so we need to see progress; 
 Smaller shrimp farms stock 3–4 times per year.  Shrimp reach 12–13 g in 15 weeks for local 
markets.  Growing seasons are March–June/July, then August–September.  It rains in between 
these times and salinity goes down.  The multi-trophic aquaculture product needs to be salinity, 
temperature, and solids tolerant. 
10. A clear, unified vision for the project, and what kind of support or benefits partners can expect 
(economic, training, supplies) needs to be determined; 
11. Decisions needed for the Guatemala project: 
 The Guatemalan partners need a clear idea of what the project hopes to achieve. 
 What kind of support or benefits can partners expect to receive (economic, training, supplies, 
other)? 
 What benefits will the University of San Carlos gain? 
 How will we measure the project benefits? 
 Who is our specialist in IMTA?  Will this person participate in the scouting mission? 
 Who is going on the scouting mission?  When?  Suggested scouting meeting dates: January 27–
31 or April 7–11.  Farmers and the University have down time in January.  The first stocking of 
shrimp ponds is in the second week of February (white spot disease occurs when T < 26°C).  
Open in mid-March. 
 Should the social scientist at the University of San Carlos be included?  Should we meet with her 
during the scouting meeting? 
 How and when will social science surveys be conducted? 
 Is an MOU required? 
12. A budget of $11,000 (expenses for 4 visiting scientists – 1 from Canada, 2 from Japan and 1 from 
USA) for a 5-day scouting trip, with a visit to shrimp or fish farms, was presented. 
Discussion on this presentation included the following points: 
Third Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
144 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
The Guatemala project needs a clear idea of what is hoped to be achieved.  We need a vision of the social 
science survey.  How many responses are needed?  Should the focus be on immediate coastal recipients?  
What should be the focal community for the survey? 
After Dr. Hirota’s brief preview of his questionnaire prepared for Indonesia (this questionnaire focuses on 
coastal communities, with indices discussed at the second PST meeting in Honolulu, based on World 
Ocean Assessment), the PST members agreed that collaborating with social scientists in Guatemala is 
critical.  Shrimp aquaculture (Option 1) is becoming more sustainable, so seems to have a higher 
probability of success.  Basic social surveys should consider the needs/uses of seaweed, and the effects on 
markets of increased production of small shrimp.  Other PST members questioned why it was necessary 
to do this.  Was it a model for increasing income, employment, or healthier diet – at what cost to the 
environment quality?  What other species could be co-produced with shrimp aquaculture—what do you 
eat; what would you eat?  It was imperative to start with social surveys and clearly identify the goal.  
There needs to be a reduction in eutrophication – water quality needs to be improved to favor tourism, etc.  
We need to specify the advantages of the proposed changes – Is tourism a benefit, or is there a local bias 
against tourism, because they are multinational corporations? 
The anticipated outcomes of the project are a database and manuals.  One possible outcome might be to 
mitigate waste disposal processing (waste processing is an ecological service that is underappreciated) in 
Guatemala; there is a need to treat the waste. 
Project goals should be to: (1) mitigate nutrient loading (environmental stewardship), (2) provide 
employment, (3) provide food security (protein), and (4) improve human well-being.  Social science 
surveys should be conducted first.  Research initiatives may need to include possible training and 
education to implement IMTA. 
Another suggestion was to do a “walk through”, to get a flavor of the types of producers and commodity 
pathways.  A workshop could be held to identify the importance/relevance to marine environment – this 
would help to set up the direction we want to go; it could be community-participatory based to get 
personal investment in the project and would give PST members the opportunity to meet with 
government officials and small shrimp farm operators.  Members should contact Dr. Trainer if they are 
interested in participating. 
3.6 Well-being cube (WB-cube) analysis progress 
“Well-being cube” analysis is a methodology for understanding the content and structure of human well-
being.  Based on psychological science, the WB-cube measures the detailed characteristics of choices and 
actions people want to make.  Therefore, using WB-cube analysis we can determine people’s needs to 
generate scientific information which PICES can provide for better human well-being.  Surveys have 
been completed for Korea, Japan and USA.  Initial results were presented, and look very encouraging. 
1. Background: Ecosystems →services →well-being (security, materials for a food life, health, good 
social relations); 
2. WB-cube analysis can be confusing – the questions are subject to interpretation and experience of the 
survey participant/conductor. 
Discussion included questions about how the analysis was done and how the data were normalized within 
country or across countries. 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Third Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 145 
3.7 Project name and web page 
A more convenient name for the PICES/MAFF project was accepted by the PST – MarWeB (Marine 
Ecosystem Health and Human Well-Being).  A MarWeB web page was established on the PICES website 
(http://www.pices.int/projects/marweb) and is being populated. 
4. PROPOSALS FOR RESEARCH TOPICS/SESSIONS 
A MarWeB Topic Session on “Ecological and human social analyses and issues relating to Integrated 
Multi Trophic Aquaculture” was proposed and ultimately accepted for PICES-2014 in Yeosu, Korea 
(Appendix 3). 
5. PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
Possible PST membership changes were discussed.  Dr. Skip McKinnell resigned from the PST, and was 
thanked for his service.  Potential additional expertise include: IMTA, aquaculture, developing countries.  
The following new members were suggested: Mark Flaherty (University of Victoria, Canada), Charles 
Trick (University of Western Ontario, Canada) and Thierry Chopin (University of New Brunswick, Canada). 
6. BUDGET FOR YEAR 3 
Suggestions for the Year 3 budget (FY 2014: April 1, 2014 – March 31, 2015) included: 
 a possible PST meeting in April 2014 or early June 2014; 
 moving $14K currently held in equipment into other activities (perhaps Indonesia related); 
 a publication of “well-being cube” results in a peer-reviewed journal; 
 the need for a translator for the Guatemala scoping trip. 
To date, the budget and workplan for Year 3: 
 Rough budget shows: FUTURE OSM – $14K; Indonesia case study – $19K; Guatemala case study – 
$35K; “well-being cube” analysis – $9K; PICES Secretariat – $10K; PICES overhead – $13K). 
 The need to develop a multi-year budget plan was recognized, in particular for field projects such as 
those in Indonesia and Guatemala. 
7. OTHER MATTERS 
The presentation to Science Board on October 19, 2013 (at the 2013 PICES Annual Meeting) highlighted 
the following three major initiatives: 
 Social-ecological interactions related to IMTA in Indonesia; 
 Social-ecological interactions related to small-scale shrimp aquaculture in Guatemala; 
 Development of the “well-being cube” approach to assessing national well-being related to marine 
systems.

Several recent studies and reports suggest that increased aquaculture production is essential if we are to 
meet the growing world demands for marine protein.  However, the rapid current development of 
Third Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
148 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
intensive fed aquaculture (e.g., finfish and shrimp), in both developed and developing countries, has 
generated concerns about the environmental impacts of these often monospecific practices.  To help 
address such issues, Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) has been attracting global attention as 
a means to conduct aquaculture activities, while at the same time improving/rehabilitating coastal 
environmental conditions and improving the well-being of the people living in coastal areas.  By 
integrating fed aquaculture with inorganic and organic extractive aquaculture (seaweed and shellfish), the 
wastes of one resource become a resource (fertilizer or food) for the others.  This “ecosystem-like” 
approach provides nutrient bioremediation capabilities, mutual benefits to the co-cultured organisms, 
economic diversification by production of other value-added marine products, and increased profitability 
and food security for the local community.  This session seeks contributions and case studies of how to 
implement and conduct IMTA activities, in particular that reduce negative impacts to the quality of the 
local environment and improve the well-being of the local human communities.  Examples of activities in 
tropical and semi-tropical locations are particularly welcome, as well as examples of general methods and 
approaches that can be applied in many different environments.  This session is a contribution of, and 
towards, the work of the PICES project on “Marine ecosystem health and human well-being” (MarWeB).

Fourth Meeting of the Project Science Team 
April 13, 2014, Kohala Coast, Hawaii, USA 
The fourth meeting of the Project Science Team (PST) for the PICES/MAFF project on “Marine 
Ecosystem Health and Human Well-Being” (MarWeB), funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan, through the Fisheries Agency of Japan (JFA), was held April 13, 2014, at 
Kohala Coast, Hawaii, USA.  The meeting was co-chaired by Drs. Mitsutaku Makino (Japan) and Ian 
Perry (Canada). 
The objective for this meeting was to review progress since the third PST meeting (October 10, 2013, 
Nanaimo, Canada), specifically: 
 Planning for the Guatemala case study; 
 Development of the Indonesia case study; 
 Preparing the detailed workplan for the Year 3 of the project (FY 2014: April 1, 2014 – March 31, 
2015), with special attention to the 2014 PICES Annual Meeting in Yeosu, Korea. 
The PST members and meeting participants are identified in Appendix 1. 
1. ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA 
The provisional agenda circulated prior to the meeting was adopted without changes (Appendix 2). 
2. INTRODUCTION OF THE PROJECT 
he goal of this project is to identify the relationships between sustainable human communities and 
productive marine ecosystems in the North Pacific, under the concept of fishery social-ecological systems.  
In particular, considering that global changes are affecting both climate and human social and economic 
conditions, the project is expected to determine: (a) how marine ecosystems support human well-being, 
and (b) how human communities support sustainable and productive marine ecosystems. 
Dr. Makino noted this was an ‘extra’ PST meeting, taking advantage of PST members attending the 
PICES FUTURE Open Science Meeting.  He reviewed the background and context for the project and 
briefly summarised the major activities to date, including: 
 First PST meeting in conjunction with PICES-2012 (October 11, 2012, Hiroshima, Japan); 
 First Indonesia workshop (March 13–14, 2013, Jakarta and Karawang, Indonesia); 
 Second PST meeting (June 10–12, 2013, Honolulu, USA); 
 First Indonesia social survey (October 2–3, 2013, Karawang, Indonesia); 
 Third PST meeting in conjunction with PICES-2013 (October 10, 2013, Nanaimo, Canada); 
 Guatemala scouting visit (January 27–31, 2014, Guatemala City, Guatemala); 
 Second Indonesia workshop and second social survey (March 24–27, 2014, Karawang, Indonesia); 
Fourth Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
150 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
 Fourth PST meeting (April 13, 2014, Kohala Coast, Hawaii, USA); 
 Progress and financial reports for Year 1 (April 1, 2012 – March 31, 2013) submitted to MAFF in 
July 2013; 
 Two articles published in PICES Press: Vol.21, No. 1 (winter 2013) and Vol. 21, No. 2 (summer 2013). 
Reports from previous PST meetings and other project-related materials are available on the project 
website at http://www.pices.int/projects/marweb. 
3. PROGRESS REPORTS 
3.1 Annual Reports for Science Board and MAFF 
The progress and financial reports for Year 1 (FY 2012: April 1, 2012 – March 31, 2013), accepted by 
MAFF/JFA, are available at the project website.  Drafts of the progress and financial reports for Year 2 
(FY 2013: April 1, 2013 – March 31, 2014) are due in June 2014 for submission to MAFF in July 2014.  
It was recommended to submit the 2014 progress and financial reports to MAFF together, and to post the 
Japanese version of the progress report on the project website. 
3.2 Results of the third PST meeting  
Dr. Perry briefly reviewed the report from the third PST meeting (October 10, 2013, Nanaimo, Canada).  
No revisions were requested, and the report is now available on the project website. 
3.3 Plan for research activities and workshops in Guatemala 
An exploratory trip to Guatemala was conducted January 27–31, 2014, to assess the possibility of 
Guatemala as a case study within the MarWeB project to evaluate the relationship between coastal 
communities and sea and the potential to develop the use of multi-trophic aquaculture as components of 
the “Sato-umi” initiative.  Four representatives from PICES spent time meeting and discussing potential 
options for the work with government representatives, academic researchers and community leaders and 
members in Guatemala City and along portions of the Pacific coast.  The reconnaissance team was made 
up of Dr. Vera Trainer (Northwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA-Fisheries, USA), Dr. Charles Trick 
(University of Western Ontario, Canada), Dr. William Cochlan and Mr. Julian Herndon (Romberg 
Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies, SFSU, USA).  A detailed report of this scouting visit is 
provided in Appendix 3. 
On January 27, the MarWeB project goals were presented to University and other Guatemalan officials in 
Guatemala City.  In turn, these officials provided an overview of the current and historical conditions of 
shrimp farming in Guatemala, including the government and academic support infrastructures associated 
with the industry.  The feasibility of testing the addition of macro-algae to the shrimp ponds to improve 
water quality was discussed, as were opportunities to reduce environmental impacts and provide an 
additional commodity product along with the shrimp.  A variety of unknowns quickly became apparent 
such as: (1) issues associated with introducing macro-algae to areas of the coast that do not naturally have 
these algae, (2) potential problems with making the water too clear for the shrimp to grow well,  
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Fourth Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 151 
(3) adding a layer of complexity to cultivation systems and approaches that already work very well, and 
(4) a lack of financial incentive to change current practices. 
The “well-being cube” approach to assessing human coastal well-being was presented to a well-educated 
test group of 5 University students, 1 social scientist and 1 laboratory technician.  The English version 
was not understandable to them.  Comments were provided that Guatemalans do not readily express their 
feelings to others, many coastal people are poorly literate (suggesting instead a group rather than individual 
approach to completing the questionnaire), and lack of clarity as to the objectives for the questionnaire. 
A 3-day field trip to coastal villages occurred on January 28–30.  The villages visited were Monterrico, 
Hawaii and Las Lisas.  Complex relationships became apparent between members of the communities, 
shrimp farmers and government and academic institutions that varied in every community.  These 
relationships appeared to be influenced by the degree of financial stability, the health of the estuaries and 
the degree of diversification of occupations, including fishing, aquaculture, agriculture and emerging 
tourism. 
Recommendations from the scouting trip are: 
For social science pillar: 
 Separate “well-being cube” analysis and multi-trophic aquaculture as there is no link between them; 
 Restructure or eliminate the “cube” (it will not add to our knowledge base); 
 Replace “cube” with a community needs assessment model (assess differences in the determinants of 
health in a community). 
For multi-trophic aquaculture pillar: 
 Multi-trophic aquaculture for shrimp ponds will place primary aquaculture in serious jeopardy; 
 The secondary product is of limited quality in Guatemala; 
 Primary aquaculture is limited by money and land; 
 The MarWeB project could introduce alternatives to shrimp aquaculture (e.g., shellfish aquaculture); 
 Tremendous experience in upper management level to support new aquaculture facilities (Guatemala 
does not need the MarWeB project to show them how to do aquaculture); 
 Demand is currently not met by imports (freshness). 
Possible objective: Collaborate with Guatemalan experts to expand economic potential (shellfish 
aquaculture), thereby bringing greater well-being to coastal communities.  This would be a self-sustaining 
enterprise managed by a cooperative. 
A proposal had been developed previously by Lic. Leonel Carrillo and Lic. Carolina Marroquin (University 
of San Carlos, Guatemala City) to enhance the culture of oysters.  Its goal was to test the feasibility of 
growing, processing and marketing C. gigas (mangrove oyster) with the Integral Fisheries Cooperative, 
Pacific coast of Guatemala.  The potential outcomes include the generation of incomes for coastal people, 
and improved health and well-being. 
 
Fourth Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
152 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
Proposed Guatemala workplan for 2014–2015: 
Social science (How do marine ecosystems support human well-being?): 
 A new social survey to be designed to address “Sato-umi in developing nations” (perhaps in 
collaboration with a recently graduated student with M.S. in Public Health); 
 Translation of the revised survey into Spanish; 
 Trip to Guatemala to perform social science assessment of “Sato-umi” with Silvia Guerra Bone 
(social science professor) and Guatemalan University students.  Possible tools include community 
meetings, cameras, etc.; 
 Outreach and acknowledgement could include distribution of books to community, cash thank-you, etc.; 
 Another trip in 2015–2016 to bring this information back to the community; 
 Suggested MarWeB leads are Drs. Trick and Trainer; most likely community would be Las Lisas, 
although an open question is why one community feels it is ‘healthy’, whereas adjacent communities 
feel they are not ‘healthy’ (e.g., a possible comparison between Las Lisas and Hawaii or Monterrico). 
Multi-trophic aquaculture (How do human communities support healthy marine ecosystems?): 
 Focus on developing the oyster aquaculture project led by University of San Carlos professors with 
key collaborators, in particular its growth, processing and marketing (this would build upon existing 
expertise); 
 Check progress and fulfillment of project goals regularly via Skype; 
 Multi-trophic aquaculture possibilities can come next (if desired). 
In discussion, the necessity for better communications between the two case studies (Indonesia and 
Guatemala) with respect to the social science studies was noted, i.e. the commodity chain mapping and 
pond culture experiments in Indonesia with the community contributions of oyster aquaculture in 
Guatemala.  It was also recommended that a community needs approach (proposed by Dr. Trick) be 
adopted for Guatemala, with a focus on the three coastal communities visited here, to determine the local 
view of community health in relation to the sea.  A broad web-based survey was recommended for the 
“well-being cube” analysis in Guatemala, possibly conducted in Year 4.  A question was raised as to 
whether the commodity chain analysis approach, similar to that conducted in the Indonesia case study, 
should also be conducted in Guatemala.  In regards to the oyster culture project, it was noted that to grow 
oysters and het them to market would likely take more than one year.  Therefore, funds may be needed for 
a second year of his work. 
Actions: 
 The MarWeB leads on social study in Indonesia and Guatemala projects, Drs. Masahito Hirota and 
Charles Trick, to communicate their ideas and plans and try to collect comparable information. 
 Dr. Trick to provide a community needs assessment model to the MarWeB Co-Chairs, and discuss 
the similarities and differences of the two approaches with Dr. Hirota to make them as common as 
possible. 
 Dr. Trainer to examine the options and need for conducting a commodity change analysis in the 
Guatemala case study, comparable to that done in the Indonesia case study.

3.4 Pond experiments, training workshop, and research support plan in Karawang, Indonesia 
Intensive shrimp aquaculture was developed in the Karawang area (3 hours from Jakarta) in the 1990s, 
and led to de-forestation, then marine pollution, shrimp mass-diseases and, ultimately, to pond 
abandonment.  The main issue is serious environmental degradation and land erosion as a result of removal 
of mangroves and building of coastal shrimp ponds.  This has resulted in a current ecological system with 
intensive shrimp monoculture. 
A preferred approach would be integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA), possibly including seaweed, 
bivalves, shrimp and fish, which would have low emissions of deleterious materials into the natural 
environment and would help stabilize the coastline (forestation).  In the social system, present practice is 
to export shrimp to Japan, Canada, USA, and the EU.  It would be desirable to produce shrimp for export 
and to use other products for local consumption, local job creation, and improved food self-sufficiency. 
MarWeB activities in Indonesia include the following: 
Ecological systems 
 Workshops to disseminate the concept of “Sato-umi” in Indonesia (March 2013, September 2014); 
 Material circulation box-model construction (2013–); 
 Training workshop for nutrient analysis and phytoplankton identification (March 2014); 
 Pond experiment for IMTA (April 2014–). 
Social systems 
 Collection of basic social information (statistics) (January 2013–); 
 Commodity chain analysis for IMTA products (October 2013–); 
 Preliminary study using an “analytic hierarchy process” (AHP) approach to support local 
decision-making (AHP is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex 
decisions); 
 Psychological analysis for well-being (“well-being cube” analysis) (January 2013–). 
A Nutrient and Phytoplankton Training Workshop was held March 25–26, 2014, at the National Center 
for Brackishwater Aquaculture in Karawang.  It was conducted for MarWeB by Dr. Mitsutaku Makino, 
Dr. Mark Wells, Mr. Julian Herndon and Mr. Brian Bill, with 16 official Indonesian participants (8 for 
nutrient analyses and 8 for phytoplankton identifications).  The workshop began with an opening 
welcome ceremony, followed by Dr. Makino’s lecture on “Sato-umi” concept, a presentation on the 
previous IMTA experiment conducted by Dr. Suhendar Sachomar (looking at the increased product 
output and not water quality aspects), a brief summary of the big picture of aquaculture and coastal 
ecosystem health issues by Dr. Wells, and then by hands-on training sessions.  Overall, the workshop was 
felt to be a success, with the objectives fully met, and the sampling and analytical methods raised to the 
quality needed for publication of the pond experiment results (see below). 
An experimental plan for a MarWeB-sponsored “Gempita” (“Sato-umi”) pond experiment was developed, 
which would also take place at the National Center for Brackishwater Aquaculture in Karawang.  A 
detailed experimental plan is provided in Appendix 4.  The main purpose of this experiment is to 
investigate the effect of IMTA on: 1) the economic return of pond operation, and 2) the water quality of 
Fourth Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
154 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
the ponds.  Water quality is defined in terms of the (macro-)nutrient concentrations of nitrate/nitrite, 
ammonia, and phosphate, in addition to the other parameters (e.g., salinity, oxygen, phytoplankton, 
bacteria, etc.).  The hypothesis being studied is whether the addition of bivalves (oyster) and Gracilaria 
(seaweed) into pond aquaculture of fish (Tilapia species) or shrimp will allow successful growth of all 
species, and decrease the nutrient (nitrite/nitrate, ammonia, phosphate) concentrations in the pond waters. 
In practice, the experiment is a balancing act between maintaining high biomass but low nutrients, i.e. 
adding two “stressors” to the pond environment: oysters to remove excess phytoplankton and seaweed to 
remove excess nutrients.  A short follow-up visit to Karawang in late June/early July by Dr. Wells is 
recommended to assess progress to date and to respond to any issues that may have arisen. 
3.5 Progress of social research for Indonesia 
Social science field research in Karawang was conducted from March 24–27, 2014.  It focused on 
mapping of the commodity chains and collection of statistics in Indonesia.  This information consisted of 
questions on: 
 “human dimensions” (number of employees, income level of owner and employees, employee’s 
education, age, sex, side jobs, work schedule, welfare or medical costs in terms of employment); 
 business matters (commodities and commodity chain, value and amount of production, price, types of 
trading partners); 
 technical matters (original method, costs, environmental damages, new culture methods, strategies 
and perspectives on the future). 
A revised/updated commodity chain map for Karawang marine culture was presented by Dr. Hirota (Fig. 1). 
Ms. Juri Hori presented new results on the “well-being cube” approach applied to Indonesia (surveying 
200 respondents and carried out in collaboration with Indonesia BPPT).  To date, “cube” analyses have 
been conducted in Japan, Korea, and the United States, each showing distinctly different results.  Overall 
results for Indonesia were consistent with a “high expectation” type outcome, although results for 
different regions within the country showed different outcomes.  There are many important factors (“cube” 
pieces), and the challenge is to identify those that contribute most to happiness. 
The 2014–2015 workplan for Indonesia was proposed to include: 
 Follow-up visit to Karawang by Dr. Wells (June 2014): Pond experiment and theoretical modeling 
processes; 
 Third Indonesia workshop for manual development in Pekalongan in September 2014 (location 
selected by Indonesian partners); 
 Third social survey in Karawang by Dr. Hirota and Ms. Hori; one of goals is to increase the sample 
size for the AHP analysis from the current 6 to 50 to be achieved using paper surveys conducted in 
collaboration with BPPT to translate from English to Indonesian. 
In discussion, the PST encouraged the publication of the “well-being cube” concept and the initial 
analyses of the surveys in Japan, Korea and the US (and possibly Indonesia) or at least for Japan and one 
other country.  Therefore, “well-being cube” surveys in the remaining PCIES member countries (Russia, 
China and Canada) may need to wait until Year 3, or possibly in Year 4 of the MarWeB project.

3.6 Topic Session on IMTA at PICES-2014 at Yeosu, Korea 
The MarWeB-sponsored Topic Session at the 2014 PICES Annual Meeting, titled “Ecological and 
human social analyses and issues relating to Integrated Multi Trophic Aquaculture” (Session S11), has 
been prepared and is described in Appendix 5.  In discussion, a field trip was suggested to an IMTA site 
near Yeosu.  This would be coordinated with a Korean co-convenor of this session, and an appropriate 
date would need to be found within the (already busy) schedule for this meeting. 
Action:  Dr. Hirota to work with Dr. Naesun Park about possible arrangements. 
4. PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
4.1 Revision of PST membership  
It was suggested to replace Dr. Dohoon Kim (National Fisheries Research and Development Institute, Korea) 
with Dr. Jungho Nam (Maritime Institute, Korea).  Also, Dr. Charles Trick (University of Western Ontario, 
Canada) was recommended as a new member, with special responsibility for co-ordinating the Guatemala 
case study. 
Fourth Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
156 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
4.2 Project case studies 
The original plan for the MarWeB project included 3 case studies: Indonesia, Guatemala, and Palau.  It is 
now recommended to discontinue Palau as a case study because of: (1) reductions in the MarWeB annual 
budget and (2) banning of fishing and conversion of the entire Palau’s EEZ into a marine protected area. 
Action:  Dr. Makino to discuss dropping the Palau case study with the responsible officer at MAFF. 
5. DISCUSSION ON THE YEAR 3 (APRIL 1, 2014 – MARCH 31, 2015) PLAN AND BUDGET 
The estimated budget for Year 3 (FY 2014: April 1, 2014 – March 31, 2015) is $75,000 – $85,000.  In 
addition, about $35,000 was carried over from Year 2 (FY 2013: April 1, 2013 – March 31, 2014).  After 
removal of the PICES overhead, about $105,000 remains for MarWeB activities in Year 3.  The PST 
recommends the following as a budget for its activities in Year 3 (all numbers are Canadian dollars):

MarWeB Guatemala Scouting Visit Report 
 
An exploratory trip to Guatemala was undertaken in January of 2014 to assess the possibility of 
conducting a survey to evaluate the relationship between coastal communities and sea and the potential to 
develop and evaluate the use of multi-trophic aquaculture as components of the “Sato-umi” initiative 
funded through the government of Japan.  Four representatives from PICES spent time meeting and 
discussing potential options for the work with government representatives, academic researchers and 
community leaders and members in Guatemala city and along portions of the Pacific coast.  The 
reconnaissance team was made up of Dr. Vera Trainer (Northwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA-
Fisheries, USA), Dr. Charles Trick (University of Western Ontario, Canada), Dr. William Cochlan and Mr. 
Julian Herndon (Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies, San Francisco State University, USA). 
An introductory meeting took place on January 27, with Guatemalan researchers and officials at the 
Center for the Study of the Sea and Aquaculture (CEMA) of the University of San Carlos (USAC) and 
included Leonel Carrillo (Lic., MS, CEMA professor), Carolina Marroquin (Lic., MS, CEMA professor), 
Carlos Francisco Marin Arriola (Ing., Director of Fisheries and Aquaculture Regulatory Division, Vice-
ministry of Agricultural Health and Regulations, Ministry of Agriculture, Cattle and Food (MAGA)), 
Luis Arturo Lopez Paredes (Lic., Head of Department of Continental Fishing, Fisheries and Aquaculture 
Regulatory Division, MAGA), Roberto Gutierrez (Lic., Head of Department for Hydrobiological 
Development, VIDER, MAGA) and Silvia Guerra Bone (Lic., MS, a social scientist w/degrees in 
Aquaculture and Rural Development). 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Fourth Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 159 
The MarWeB project goals were presented to University and other Guatemalan officials.  In turn, these 
officials provided an overview of the current and historical conditions of shrimp farming in Guatemala, 
including the government and academic support infrastructures associated with the industry.  The 
feasibility of testing the addition of macro-algae to the shrimp ponds to improve water quality was discussed, 
as were opportunities to reduce environmental impacts and provide an additional commodity product 
along with the shrimp.  A variety of unknowns quickly became apparent, including: (1) issues associated 
with introducing a macro-algae to areas of the coast that do not naturally have macro-algae, (2) potential 
problems with making the water too clear for the shrimp to grow well, (3) adding a layer of complexity to 
cultivation systems and approaches that already work very well, and (4) a lack of financial incentive to 
change current practices.  Some of the aquaculture facilities use seawater mixed with fresh water from 
wells and some use water straight out of the local estuaries along the coast.  Waste water, usually dumped at 
the end of harvest, is pumped out, untreated to the estuary or beach.  Typically there are no water exchanges 
during the cultivation period, but water is added to replenish that lost to evaporation or infiltration 
through the sand and clay bottom ponds (newer ponds are plastic lined, reducing this problem).  The 
aquaculture officials were informed about our intent to work with academic colleagues in Guatemala and 
their students at the test lab on the coast.  Ideally, a shrimp farmer who is really interested in collaboration 
would permit us expand to a commercial site. 
The majority of shrimp aquaculture in Guatemala is on the Pacific side.  Benthic trawling for shrimp in 
the ocean has decreased in output over the years, and the fleet has dwindled, likely as a result of 
overfishing reducing stocks and increased fuel costs affecting the profit margin.  In 2013, there were 39 
farms operating on 1,070 hectares of land and employing approximately 1200 people.  The price for 
shrimp is as high as it is ever been.  Domestic shrimp consumption has increased since 2007 and is a 
special treat, mostly associated with vacations to the coast or parties and drinking on weekends because 
of its expense.  In general, there are 3 shrimp harvests per year.  Mexico’s shrimp production has 
decreased due to viruses.  There are fewer problems with viruses in Guatemala – smaller farms are better 
controlled with regards to feeding rates and environmental conditions such as temperature, salinity, oxygen, 
etc.  They do not exchange water, so they also do not exchange disease with their neighbors.  The new 
shrimp disease (EMC – a type of Vibrio parahemolyticus with a phage or something that makes it toxic) 
was imported from Asia to Mexico.  For this reason, imports from Mexico to Guatemala are now closed 
(no nauplii imported). 
Lic. Bone, the social scientist, indicated that it is difficult for Guatemalans to express feelings, especially 
to strangers.  A 3–4 page survey is the maximum that could be done or, perhaps, something more tangible 
than a written survey would be better.  It is more common and appropriate to ask questions to village 
leaders during workshops. 
The “well-being cube” questionnaire was presented to a well-educated test group of 5 University students,  
1 social scientist and 1 laboratory technician.  The English version was not understandable to them.  They 
could not even complete the first page of the questionnaire.  For example, they did not know whether the 
questionnaire meant “sea or whole coast – estuary or related area”. 
Suggestions from the test group regarding the survey: 
 Some of the questions could have been combined. 
 Draw the sea and show your relationship with it (given to families); draw a picture of yourself with 
the sea. 
Fourth Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
160 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
 Some freedom is needed for participants to express their relationship with the sea.  However, it was 
not known how results could be measured if such freedom was given. 
 There was concern that if participants were given choices that they would tell you what they thought 
you want to hear. 
 Fishermen in the sea vs. estuary are very different. 
 Lic. Bone requested clarifications on our objective as her goal was so to find a better way to ask our 
questions in Guatemala where the literacy rate is very low. 
 Group vs. individual questionnaires are desired because (1) some leaders do not read or write, (2) some 
individuals are too shy, (3) individuals will give you the answers that you want, (4) Guatemalans are 
not good at expressing feelings – seamen are supposed to be tough, and (5) there will be no expression 
of feeling to someone who is not part of the community. 
Suggestions for workshops: 
 Guides work with students; 
 Look at needs that their professional backgrounds can address; 
 Questions to ask – (1) how do you invest time? (2) socio-economic questions and needs (male/female, 
income), (3) conflict between mayor and religious leader. 
 There may be better reception with some groups vs. others.  Students and Lic. Bone have worked 
with fisherman, but others may not be as receptive. 
 Discussion? 
 Pictures?  Either draw pictures or give disposable cameras to families. 
Some communities (few) have health centers where they get vaccines.  However, students have information 
on specific communities – Is it ok to work with these “known” communities rather than working toward 
coast wide surveys?  Health and economic data may be available from past studies.  Use FACT model vs. 
CUBE model? 
Needs for the scientific study: 
 Shrimp feed is required as it is the largest expense, along with electricity for aerators. 
 Analytical equipment is kept at labs in Guatemala City because the coast lab is not secure.  
Autoanalyzers are found at University of San Carlos’ water quality labs. 
A 3-day field trip to coastal villages occurred on January 28–30, with stops in Iztapa, Monterrico, Hawaii 
and Las Lisas.  We met with a wide spectrum of community members, including shrimp farmers, fishers, 
leaders from community development associations, fishing associations and cooperatives, shrimp 
hatchery managers and technicians and government officials, and had the opportunity to tour an 
assortment of shrimp farms using old and new methods of production.  We also toured the only operating 
shrimp hatchery in the country and got an in-depth overview of the state of the technological abilities of 
the local production facilities and a summary of the historical events and scientific research that have led 
to the current shrimp seed supply and cultivation approach in Guatemala. 
Through these interactions, complex relationships became apparent between members of the communities, 
shrimp farmers and government and academic institutions that varied in every community.  These 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Fourth Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 161 
relationships appeared to be influenced by the degree of financial stability, the health of the estuaries and 
the degree of diversification of occupations including fishing, aquaculture, agriculture and emerging tourism. 
Many expressed concern regarding the apparent environmental degradation that has reduced the 
availability of fish and shrimp in the estuaries, possibly resulting from (1) effluent from shrimp farm 
affecting marine and estuary life, (2) effluent from sugar cane releases following heavy rains carry 
pesticides and sediment load to the estuaries and the sea, and (3) overfishing through the use of illegal 
nets with increasingly smaller holes.  Currently, a common technique is to use window screening intended 
to keep mosquitoes out of homes to fish in the estuary.  In one town meeting, a life-long fisherman,  
Mr. Jose Manuel Diaz, who at “over 50” believes himself to be a very old man, proceeded to give an 
apparently unrehearsed assessment of their communities’ current predicament, roughly paraphrased as 
follows:  
“I am an old man of over 50 years.  I have been a fisherman my whole life.  We destroyed our own 
fisheries, both the estuary and the ocean.  This is the reason why we have no jobs.  All we know is the sea 
and fishing.  As fishermen we spend our time finding ways to improve our profession.  We made better 
nets and so did my colleagues, up to and including using window screening, so now we are catching 
everything that is left.  We have no choice but to catch whatever we can to feed our families and pay our 
bills.  I believe that within two years there will be nothing left. Some people get out of fishing and find 
work at a hotel for 5-6 hours and earn only 50 quetzals (about $6 USD).  Alternatives include shrimping 
illegally or harvesting and selling turtle eggs.  If they are confiscated by the police, the police sell them.” 
This statement, which was more plainly and sincerely given than what we can convey here, and was 
considerably longer than what we have annotated, was strongly supported by the rest of the group present.   
Dr. Trick asked if it would be OK to share their story.  Then, perhaps together we could find alternatives 
for their community.  They want to share their story for the benefit of today’s youth. 
A final meeting with Lic. Carrillo and Lic. Marroquin was held on Friday, January 31.  Possibilities for 
science project include: 
 Marine fish and inland ponds – Mexico has experience with this approach.  Lutjanus (red snapper) 
and Centropomus (robalo) are both carnivores but feed on invertebrates in the first year.  Both can be 
purchased in Mexico and Costa Rica.  They were not careful in previous attempts to bring these fish 
into culture. 
 Mollusk cultivation.  A student did some work at Las Lisas – she mistakenly used a pearl oyster 
instead of a food oyster.  A market study was done for oysters in a village near El Salvador.  A 
proposal has been written for shellfish cultivation in Las Lisas. Students were going to measure fecal 
coliform and heavy metals in the proposal (total cost was $16–20,000 US).  Students (after school) 
and women were involved in the project and could run it.  Lic. Marroquin thinks the proposal would 
cost ~$10,000 without the heavy metal or fecal coliform testing (just for the shellfish culture).  Dr. 
Trick mentioned potential Canadian funding for Guatemala – sustainable foods directed by women. 
 Lic. Carrillo – 2000 red Tilapia in marine water (tolerate salinity up to 32 ppt) – can be called “cherry 
snapper” instead of Tilapia.  There is a possibility for multitrophic aquaculture of this Tilapia with 
shrimp. 
 The mayor of Iztapa was interested in providing Tilapia seed to families.  He is willing to give 
equipment and seed.  An idea for a “cherry snapper festival” was discussed.  Seawater grown red 
Fourth Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
162 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
Tilapia is supposed to taste better than freshwater grown varieties, however feed would be the big 
expense. 
 Multi-trophic: bacteria – phytoplankton – shrimp.  Bacteria reduce organic loads – promote the use of 
bacteria at more of the farms.  ~25% of the shrimp farmers do not use bacteria. 
 Seaweed (macro-algae) idea is not going to work given the current operational success of shrimp 
cultivation in Guatemala. 
Social science: 
 How can we do “Sato-umi” better?  Dr. Trick has a student who can do a practicum in Guatemala.  
Cost will be $5,000.  Need to know early next year for May 2015. 
Summary: 
There is definitely an important relationship between the Guatemalan coastal communities and the sea.  
At the most fundamental level it is a source of livelihood for many and a component of their immediate 
environment.  Characterizing the relationship may be difficult given the cultural barriers and apparent 
literacy problems of portions of the coastal population.  We encountered a diverse group of people and 
were surprised that the narrative regarding the relationship to the sea that we learned in each village had 
to be updated or altered to reflect the different experiences and attitudes of the people we met in the 
different towns.  The successes and troubles of each area were different, even though at first glimpse, 
each town appeared similar, and they were all in close proximity to each other.  We found the people on 
the coast to be initially guarded in their interaction with us, but quickly warmed to us and our proposal to 
study their communities.  There was a definite interest in any type of project-based aid that we could 
provide or help facilitate.  The people we spoke to were courteous, well-spoken and took their meetings 
with us seriously as they sent their community leaders, well dressed and organized to meet us and listen 
to what we had to say.  In our colleagues at the University of San Carlos we have found individuals 
committed to the education and improvement of the students they mentor and dedicated to trying to make 
their country a better place for all of its people.  Their country appears to be making a concerted effort to 
lift itself out of the current disarray and economic stagnation influenced by the violent civil war and 
political repression of the past. 
As for multi-trophic aquaculture, it is difficult to say if there is a way to integrate macro-algae to the 
existing shrimp farm infrastructure in a way that will be beneficial and sustainable in real life practice.  
The shrimp aquaculture is strong, well-organized and very successful, especially considering the lack of 
sophisticated regional analytical facilities and the apparent low budget approach utilized by most of the 
facilities.  It demonstrates a strong will to succeed and impressive resourcefulness. 
Recommendations: 
Social survey:  The current survey is too long and complex as well as not clearly translated from Japanese 
to English to be effective in any of the potential study sites in Guatemala.  A different approach will be 
necessary if there is any useful knowledge to be gained.  Options for the social survey need to be 
discussed, but may include a shorter survey with different sections, some multiple-choice and some 
allowing for more creative answers like written responses or drawings.  Perhaps the use of disposable 
cameras distributed to individuals or families in the area would yield a better picture of the communities’ 
relationship with the sea.  A local social scientist working with a member of the PICES group or a US or 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Fourth Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 163 
Canadian graduate student may work.  Care needs to be taken in deciding how to distribute cameras or in 
selecting members of the community to take the survey.  It is imperative to work with the community 
leaders and academics we encountered to ensure a successful outcome of any social science study. 
Multi-trophic cultivation:  It is clear that the shrimp farming industry is in a very good shape.  There are 
knowledgeable technical staff and business personnel involved, and there is strong support from the 
Guatemalan government and academic institutions.  The shrimp farmers will likely be risk averse and 
hesitant to try out something that has not been demonstrated.  Adding macro-algae to shrimp ponds may 
not add much value or benefit to the current infrastructure.  Perhaps a different type of multi-trophic 
activity would be more successful.  Two potential projects present themselves initially: 
1. Combining red Tilapia in marine water with shrimp and a bacterial flocculation community may be 
one possible approach.  There is existing infrastructure and knowledge for Tilapia cultivation in the 
country.  Choosing a community close to the CEMA laboratory on the coast would ensure easier 
collaboration with aquaculture students and faculty doing work on the coast.  In Iztapa there may 
even be support from the mayor and municipal resources. 
2. A project already previously outlined by CEMA faculty and students for oyster cultivation in the 
town of Las Lisas would be easier to get off the ground.  There is an existing proposal, including a 
market study that was submitted to the Guatemalan government, but was not funded as the funds 
were given to a fishing cooperative instead. 
Whatever the chosen project, it is important that sufficient funds and time be allocated to a single project 
in order to maximize the chance of success in one community and to have a demonstration of what is 
possible for other communities to see and potentially follow.  It should be a community based project that 
allows for not only integration of multi-trophic cultivation technology, but also successful interaction 
with community members who feel left out of the rapidly changing economic and environmental situation 
in their towns. 
Appendix 4 
Gempita (Sato-umi) Pond Experimental Plan 
National Center for Brackishwater Aquaculture, Karawang 
Purpose 
The main purpose of the Gempita pond experiment is to investigate the effect of integrated multitrophic 
aquaculture (IMTA) on: 1) the economic return of pond operation, and 2) the water quality of the ponds.  
Here, we define water quality in terms of the (macro-)nutrient concentrations of nitrate/nitrite, ammonia, 
and phosphate, in addition to the other parameters (e.g., salinity, oxygen, phytoplankton, bacteria, etc.). 
Hypothesis 
The addition of bivalves (oyster) and Gracilaria (seaweed) into pond aquaculture of fish (Tilapia species) 
or shrimp (species) will allow successful growth of all species, and decrease the nutrient (nitrite/nitrate, 
ammonia, phosphate) concentrations in pond waters. 
  
Fourth Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
164 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
Ideal pond conditions 
The optimal pond conditions for shrimp and fish are a high phytoplankton biomass, including diatoms 
and green algae, with low light penetration.  The phytoplankton provide additional food which enhances 
the flavor of the shrimp and fish.  Low light penetration is preferred as it creates less stress for the shrimp 
(and fish?) and prevents the growth of grasses in the pond.  For these reasons, nutrients (nitrate, 
phosphate) are added to high concentrations at the very start, quickly ramping up and maintaining high 
biomass over the pond duration.  In some cases, silicate also is added to encourage diatom growth. 
Experimental design 
The experiment will use 4 x 4000 m
2
 ponds at the National Center for Brackishwater Aquaculture, 
Karawang: 
Pond 1 – Shrimp only 
Pond 2 – Shrimp + Gracilaria + oysters 
Pond 3 – Tilapia only 
Pond 4 – Tilapia + Gracilaria + oysters 
All ponds are being prepared for an early May start, which depends on them drying out sufficiently before 
adding the brackish water.  Water will be drawn from a tidal canal, mixed with river water, if needed, to 
establish a low salinity (~17-20 ppt?). 
Gracilaria will need to be placed in enclosures (10 cages distributed around the pond) to prevent the fish 
feeding on it.  These cages will use as large a net mesh size as feasible to maximize the water flow 
through them.  We will use the same distribution of cages for the Gracilaria in the shrimp ponds, again 
using the largest net mesh size as appropriate. 
The oysters will be placed in several (10?) designated patches where the bottom sediment is selected to be 
appropriate for the oysters.  Using these patches (rather than distributed randomly across the pond 
bottom) will help us for sampling and monitoring of oyster health and survival. 
It is essential that the primary aquaculture species (shrimp and Tilapia species) are successfully raised for 
market.  If these species begin to experience poor health or growth success during the experiment, 
conditions must be altered at the discretion of Mr. Waru to ensure a healthy outcome. 
Sampling 
A primary measure needed in this experiment is the total amount of biomass product achieved (shrimp, 
Tilapia, Gracilaria and oysters).  In addition to assessing the health and growth rates of these species on a 
regular (monthly?) basis, the following water quality measurements will be made: 
Two times per week:  Temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, ammonium, nitrate/nitrite, phosphate, 
silicate (we need to send down the kit for this measurement), light penetration (Secchi); 
Once per week:  Suspended solids, chlorophyll a, phytoplankton community composition, bacteria (total 
+ total vibrio); 
Once every 2 weeks:  Total organic matter. 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Fourth Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 165 
Pond operation 
As mentioned above, the primary concern is that the Tilapia and shrimp species remain healthy during the 
pond experiment.  A concern raised by Mr. Wadi is that Gracilaria may decrease the nutrients too much, 
decreasing then the phytoplankton abundance impacting both the Tilapia and shrimp, as well as possibly 
allowing light to penetrate to the bottom of the pond (which would allow grass growth).  To avoid this 
problem, Mr. Wadi will vary the amount of Gracilaria in the pond as needed, either cutting it back or 
removing it entirely if nutrient levels drop too far.  Ideally, we will find a balance, where nutrient 
concentrations are decreased but not enough to adversely affect the phytoplankton biomass. 
Day-to-day management 
Mr. Wadi will use his considerable expertise to manage the ponds on a day-to-day basis, making the 
changes he feels are essential to maintain the health of the shrimp and Tilapia.  Drs. Suhendaran and 
Wells will keep in close contact, with weekly updates and data exchanges with Agus Dwiono and Atri 
Triana.  When difficulties arise, they will communicate by phone and/or e-mail to determine the best 
steps to take, but will defer to Mr. Wadi’s final assessment of the best way forward.

Several recent studies and reports suggest that increased aquaculture production is essential if we are to 
meet the growing world demands for marine protein.  However, the rapid current development of 
intensive fed aquaculture (e.g., finfish and shrimp), in both developed and developing countries, has 
generated concerns about the environmental impacts of these often monospecific practices.  To help 
address such issues, Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) has been attracting global attention as 
a means to conduct aquaculture activities, while at the same time improving/rehabilitating coastal 
environmental conditions and improving the well-being of the people living in coastal areas.  By 
integrating fed aquaculture with inorganic and organic extractive aquaculture (seaweed and shellfish), the 
wastes of one resource become a resource (fertilizer or food) for the others.  This “ecosystem-like” 
approach provides nutrient bioremediation capabilities, mutual benefits to the co-cultured organisms, 
economic diversification by production of other value-added marine products, and increased profitability 
and food security for the local community.  This session seeks contributions and case studies of how to 
implement and conduct IMTA activities, in particular that reduce negative impacts to the quality of the 
local environment and improve the well-being of the local human communities.  Examples of activities in

tropical and semi-tropical locations are particularly welcome, as well as examples of general methods and 
approaches that can be applied in many different environments.  This session is a contribution of, and 
towards, the work of the PICES Project on “Marine ecosystem health and human well-being” (MarWeB).

Fifth Meeting of the Project Science Team 
October 16, 2014Yeosu, Korea 
The fifth meeting of the Project Science Team (PST) for the PICES/MAFF project on “Marine Ecosystem 
Health and Human Well-Being” (MarWeB), funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
(MAFF) of Japan, through the Fisheries Agency of Japan (JFA), was held October 16, 2014, in 
conjunction with the 2014 PICES Annual Meeting in Yeosu, Korea. 
The meeting objective was to review progress from the fourth PST meeting in April 2014 and plans for 
FY 2015, in particular: a) development of the Guatemala case study and b) further development of the 
Indonesia case study. 
The meeting was co-chaired by Drs. Mitsutaku Makino (Japan) and Ian Perry (Canada).  All PST 
members (Appendix 1) and the Project Coordinator, Dr. Alexander Bychkov, attended the meeting. 
1. ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA 
The agenda was adopted as proposed (Appendix 2).  The PST welcomed its new members, Dr. Jongoh 
Nam (Maritime Institute, Korea) and Dr. Charles Trick (University of Western Ontario, Canada). 
2. INTRODUCTION OF THE PROJECT 
The goal of this project is to identify the relationships between sustainable human communities and 
productive marine ecosystems in the North Pacific, under the concept of fishery social-ecological systems.  
Considering that global changes are affecting both climate and human social and economic conditions, 
the project is expected to determine: (a) how marine ecosystems support human well-being, and (b) how 
human communities support sustainable and productive marine ecosystems.

3. PROGRESS REPORTS 
The MarWeB project has focussed on three major initiatives: 
1. Social-ecological interactions related to integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) in Indonesia; 
2. Social-ecological interactions related to small-scale shrimp aquaculture in Guatemala; 
3. Development of the “well-being cube” approach to assessing national well-being related to marine 
systems. 
3.1 Annual Reports for Science Board and MAFF/JFA 
The progress and financial reports for Year 2 (FY 2013: April 1, 2013 – March 31, 2014), accepted by 
MAFF/JFA, were presented for information and are available at the project website.  The progress report 
includes a glossary for Japanese readers.  Drafts of progress and financial reports for Year 3 (FY 2014: 
April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015) are due in June 2015 for submission to MAFF/JFA in July 2015. 
3.2 Report of the fourth PST meeting 
Dr. Perry briefly reviewed the report from the fourth PST meeting held April 13, 2014, in conjunction 
with the PICES FUTURE Open Science Meeting at the Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel, Kohala Coast, 
Hawaii, USA.  The report was approved with no changes and is now available at the project website. 
3.3 Development of the research activities in Guatemala 
Based on an evaluation of existing shrimp-focused aquaculture in Guatemala, and considering the 
interests and goals of the MarWeb project (and comparability with the project activities in Indonesia), a 
focus on multi-trophic aquaculture for science pillar is recommended.  The goal would be to collaborate 
with Guatemalan experts to expand economic potential (shellfish aquaculture), thereby bringing greater 
well-being to coastal communities.  This would be a self-sustaining enterprise managed by a cooperative. 
It was proposed to support an oyster study led by Lic. Leonel Carrillo and Lic. Carolina Marroquin 
(University of San Carlos, Guatemala City).  The objective would be to test the feasibility of growing, 
processing and marketing Crassostrea gigas (mangrove oyster) with the Integral Fisheries Cooperative on 
the Pacific coast of Guatemala.  The potential outcomes include income for coastal people, and improved 
health and well-being. 
Specific objectives are to: 
 Assess the performance of the long-line shellfish culture system in La Barrona estuarine lagoons; 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Fifth Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 169 
 Determine yield potential of the culture system, including growth rates and time for mollusks to reach 
market size; 
 Evaluate shellfish survival rates during different phases of their growth and assess mitigation 
methods against predation; 
 Adapt or develop culture practices appropriate for the management of the system; 
 Produce oysters that conform to the microbiologic standards of food safety; 
 Assist in finding suitable markets for the sale of the final product. 
The anticipated results include: 
 Start the commercial production of C. gigas in the southern region of Guatemala, using a cooperative 
model; 
 Within a year, it is anticipated that this community will earn income from oyster sales to allow 
reinvestment in their own businesses and to improve their financial situation; 
 Partially meet the domestic demand of consumption of oysters, which is currently met by imports 
paid in dollars; 
 Validate a system of commercial production of bivalve mollusks, which could be replicated in other 
regions with similar environmental characteristics. 
In discussion, it was noted that C. gigas is a common invasive species world-wide, and Drs. Trainer and 
Trick were asked to check if there is any concern about introducing it to this region or it is already present.  
Also, questions were raised as to whether the local communities have the legal rights to this aquaculture, 
i.e., who ‘owns’ the water and who would benefit from this activity? 
Dr. Trick presented the concept of a ‘participatory needs assessment’.  In this approach, success is 
considered to result from a step-wise process: (1) to develop a questionnaire to understand two things 
within a community, specifically what they want, and what are they missing? and (2) to develop a way to 
measure “success” if changes were to occur.  For example, in the case of Guatemala the problem is to 
establish how shrimp aquaculture can enhance the community’s sense of well-being and purpose.  The 
level of literacy was noted, and the use of disposed cameras was suggested.  It was recommended Dr. 
Trick to begin a community needs assessment for the social aspects of this project. 
Actions: 
 Drs. Trainer and Trick to check on whether C. gigas is already present in Guatemala, and if there are 
any legal issues around ownership of rights to coastal waters; 
 Dr. Trick to begin a community needs assessment for the social aspects of this project. 
3.4 Development of the research activities in Indonesia 
Intensive shrimp aquaculture was developed in the Karawang area (3 hours from Jakarta) in the 1990s, 
and led to de-forestation, then marine pollution, shrimp mass-diseases and, ultimately, to pond 
abandonment.  The main issue is serious environmental degradation and land erosion as a result of removal 
of mangroves and building of coastal shrimp ponds.  This has resulted in a current ecological system with 
intensive shrimp monoculture. 
Fifth Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
170 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
A preferred approach would be IMTA, possibly including seaweed, bivalves, shrimp and fish, which 
would have low emissions of deleterious materials into the natural environment and would help stabilize 
the coastline (forestation).  In the social system, present practice is to export shrimp to Japan, Canada, 
USA, and the EU.  It would be desirable to produce shrimp for export and to use other products for local 
consumption, local job creation, and improved food self-sufficiency. 
MarWeB activities include the following: 
Ecological systems 
 Workshop to disseminate the concept of “Sato-umi” in Indonesia (March 2013, September 2014); 
 Material circulation box-model construction (2013–); 
 Training workshop for nutrient analysis and phytoplankton identification (March 2014); 
 Pond experiment for IMTA (August 2014–); 
Social systems 
 Collection of basic social information (statistics) (January 2013–); 
 Commodity chain analysis for IMTA products (October 2013–); 
 Preliminary study using an “analytic hierarchy process” (AHP) approach to support local decision-
making (AHP is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions); 
 Psychological analysis for well-being (“well-being cube” analysis) (January 2013–). 
The first pond experiment at the National Center for Brackishwater Aquaculture in Karawang started in 
August 2014.  The main purpose of this experiment is to investigate the effect of IMTA on: (1) the 
economic return of pond operations, and (2) the water quality of the ponds, defined in terms of the 
(macro-)nutrient concentrations of nitrate/nitrite, ammonia, and phosphate, in addition to other parameters 
(e.g., oxygen, phytoplankton, bacteria, etc.).  The underlining hypothesis is that the addition of bivalves 
(Anadara) and seaweed (Gracilaria) into the aquaculture ponds of fish (Tilapia species) or shrimp will 
allow successful growth of all species, and decrease of macronutrient concentrations. 
The optimal pond conditions for shrimp and fish are a high phytoplankton biomass (including diatoms 
and green algae), with low light penetration.  The phytoplankton provide additional food which enhances 
the flavor of the shrimp and fish.  Low light penetration creates less stress for the shrimp (and fish?) and 
prevents the growth of grasses in the pond.  For these reasons, nutrients (nitrate, phosphate) are added to 
high concentrations at the very start, quickly ramping up and maintaining high biomass over the pond 
experiment. 
The experiment was designed using four 4000 m
2
 ponds: Pond 1 – Shrimp only, Pond 2 – Shrimp + 
Gracilaria + Anadara, Pond 3 – Fish (Tilapia) only, and Pond 4 – Tilapia + Gracilaria + Anadara.  All 
ponds were prepared for a mid-August start (delayed to allow them to dry out sufficiently before adding the 
brackish water).  Water to the ponds was drawn from a tidal canal, mixed with river water to establish a 
low salinity (~17–25 mg/kg). 
  
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Fifth Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 171 
Early results suggest the following: 
1. There appears to be no negative effect on the shrimp or Tilapia weight gain in the ponds with the 
Gracilaria and Anadara.  This was the main concern. 
2. The replenishment of water in the Tilapia ponds from the reservoir is a potential source of nutrient 
variability, but concentrations in all ponds seem to track each other reasonably well (particularly 
NO
3
/NO
2
).  The implication is that despite the considerable mixing (from paddle mixers), vertical 
gradients may be forming within the 1 m deep ponds.  There also may be variation from site to site 
within the pond as the water circulates.  Collecting vertically integrated samples was suggested. 
3. The biggest problem was the high level of nutrient added to the ponds to generate enough plankton to 
prevent light from reaching the bottom of the pond. 
The social science studies in Indonesia have been very active.  A revised commodity chain model was 
presented (Fig. 1).  Dr. Hirota recommended moving towards a ‘system dynamics’ model approach to 
explore the effects of changing parameters (e.g., in the commodity chain), and examining the impacts of 
changes to various social parameters (Fig. 2).  An AHP approach was suggested to evaluate the choice of 
scenarios, e.g., the effects on outcomes of intensive culture, polyculture and IMTA approaches. 
Actions: 
 Dr. Makino to discuss with Prof. Suhendar the possibility to develop the ‘natural’ process manual 
(major project outcome), based on the pond results; 
 Dr. Hirota to produce a description and application of the social aspects for the MarWeB report and 
the project website; 
 Dr. Wells to continue overseeing the pond experiments and interpreting the results. 
3.5 Topic Session on IMTA at PICES-2014 
The IMTA Topics Session was briefly reviewed by the co-convenors.  The schedule of speakers is 
provided in Appendix 3.  In addition, a small field trip to visit Korean aquaculture sites was arranged by 
Dr. Nam. 
3.6 Other reports 
A brief presentation on progress with the “well-being cube” analysis was given by Ms. Juri Hori.  She 
pointed out that all the countries surveyed to date (Japan, Indonesia, Korea, USA) have similar processes 
of well-being with respect to the ocean.  However, the well-being of the ocean’s bounty has different 
meanings depending on the country.  Therefore, the concept of what is a “desirable ocean” differs from 
country to country.  Also the conservation strategy may change from person to person, even within each 
country.  The analyses are progressing towards a paper in a peer-reviewed journal.

4. PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
4.1 Possible revision of PST membership  
Dr. Makino recommended that Dr. Osamu Tamaru (Japan) be invited to join the PST to help with the 
social dynamical analyses. 
4.2 Discussion on the FY 2014 budget  
The budget breakdown for Year 3 of the project (FY 2014: April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015), as proposed 
at the fourth PST meeting in April 2014, is presented in Table 1. 
5. DISCUSSIONS ON THE FY 2015 WORKPLAN AND BUDGET 
The estimated budget for Year 4 of the project (FY 2015: April 1, 2015 – March 31, 2016) is $85,000.  
There may be a small carry-over of unspent funds from FY 2014, and this will be confirmed once the 
accounting for Year 3 has been completed. 
The PST decided there were too many uncertainties and projects in action as of October 2014 to create a 
reasonable draft budget for FY 2015 (for example, the Indonesian pond experiments are on-going, and the 
field trips and a Community Needs Assessment survey in Guatemala is planned for early in 2015.  There 
was also discussion of whether an inter-sessional PST meeting would be needed.  It was noted that there 
were inter-sessional meetings in 2013 and 2014, and these felt to be extremely useful for concentrated 
planning and budgeting.  The option of having an inter-sessional meeting in 2015 was left open, 
depending on progress by the Indonesia and Guatemala case studies.  A starter budget for MarWeB 
activities in 2015–2016, to be completed by correspondence or at an inter-sessional meeting, is presented 
in Table 2.

Several recent studies and reports suggest that increased aquaculture production is essential if we are to 
meet the growing world demands for marine protein.  However, the rapid current development of 
intensive fed aquaculture (e.g., finfish and shrimp), in both developed and developing countries, has 
generated concerns about the environmental impacts of these often monospecific practices.  To help 
address such issues, Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) has been attracting global attention as 
a means to conduct aquaculture activities, while at the same time improving/rehabilitating coastal 
environmental conditions and improving the well-being of the people living in coastal areas.  By 
integrating fed aquaculture with inorganic and organic extractive aquaculture (seaweed and shellfish), the 
wastes of one resource become a resource (fertilizer or food) for the others.  This “ecosystem-like” 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Fifth Meeting

approach provides nutrient bioremediation capabilities, mutual benefits to the co-cultured organisms, 
economic diversification by production of other value-added marine products, and increased profitability 
and food security for the local community.  This session seeks contributions and case studies of how to 
implement and conduct IMTA activities, in particular that reduce negative impacts to the quality of the 
local environment and improve the well-being of the local human communities.  Examples of activities in 
tropical and semi-tropical locations are particularly welcome, as well as examples of general methods and 
approaches that can be applied in many different environments.  This session is a contribution of, and 
towards, the work of the PICES Project on “Marine ecosystem health and human well-being” (MarWeB).

Sixth Meeting of the Project Science Team 
October 14, 2015, Qingdao, China 
The sixth meeting of the Project Science Team (PST) for the PICES/MAFF project on “Marine Ecosystem 
Health and Human Well-Being” (MarWeB), funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
(MAFF) of Japan, through the Fisheries Agency of Japan (JFA), was held October 14, 2015, in 
conjunction with the 2015 PICES Annual Meeting in Qingdao, China.  The meeting objective was to 
review progress from the fifth PST meeting in October 2014 and plans for FY 2016 (final year of the 
project), in particular: a) consistency among case studies and b) concrete and specific image for the final 
products of this project (manual and database). 
The meeting was co-chaired by Drs. Mitsutaku Makino (Japan) and Ian Perry (Canada).  The Project 
Science Team members and meeting participants are identified in Appendix 1. 
1. ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA 
The agenda was adopted as proposed (Appendix 2). 
2. INTRODUCTION OF THE PROJECT 
The goal of this project is to identify the relationships between sustainable human communities and 
productive marine ecosystems in the North Pacific, under the concept of fishery social-ecological systems.  
Considering the global changes are affecting both climate and human social and economic conditions, the 
project is expected to determine: (a) how marine ecosystems support human well-being, and (b) how human 
communities support sustainable and productive marine ecosystems. 
Dr. Makino briefly reviewed the background and context for the project and summarised the major activities 
to date, including: 
 First PST meeting in conjunction with PICES-2012 (October 11, 2012, Hiroshima, Japan);

materials are available on the project’s website at http://www.pices.int/projects/marweb. 
3. PROGRESS REPORTS 
The MarWeB project has focussed on three major initiatives: 
1. Social-ecological interactions related to integrated multi-trophic aquaculture in Indonesia; 
2. Social-ecological interactions related to small-scale shrimp aquaculture in Guatemala; 
3. Development of the “well-being cube” approach to assessing national well-being related to marine 
systems. 
3.1 Annual Reports for Science Board and MAFF/JFA 
The progress and financial reports for Year 3 (FY 2014: April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015) were presented 
for information and are available at the project website.  The progress report includes a glossary for 
Japanese readers.  Drafts of progress and financial reports for Year 4 (FY 2015: April 1, 2015 to March 
31, 2016) are due in April 2016 for preliminary presentation at MAFF/JFA in May 2016. 
3.2 Report of the fifth PST meeting 
Dr. Perry briefly reviewed the report from the fifth PST meeting held October 16, 2014, in conjunction 
with the 2014 PICES Annual Meeting in Yeosu, Korea.  No revisions were requested. 
3.3 Development of the research activities in Indonesia 
Natural science studies 
This project is investigating social-ecological interactions related to integrated multi-trophic aquaculture 
(IMTA) in Indonesia.  The purpose of the pond experiment initiated in August 2014 is to investigate the 
Sixth Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
180 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
effect of IMTA to: (1) increase the economic return of pond operation, and 2) improve the water quality 
of the ponds to reduce the release of nutrients to coastal waters.  The underlining hypothesis is that the 
addition of bivalves (Anadara) and seaweed (Gracilaria) into the aquaculture ponds of fish (Tilapia 
species) or shrimp will allow successful growth of all species, and decrease of macronutrient concentrations. 
In summary, the preliminary results from the experiments include: 
 Nutrient release must decrease from shrimp and Tilapia pond aquaculture to coastal waters; 
 The question is whether co-culture of Gracilaria and Anadara with shrimp and Tilapia will decrease 
dissolved nutrient levels – too soon to tell, but not looking good; 
 Early results indicate that inclusion of Gracilaria and Anadara does not decrease the growth of 
shrimp or Tilapia – this may be an important source of additional income for communities; 
 The addition of co-cultured species into the ponds affects the phytoplankton community composition 
— benefits to the quality of shrimp and Tilapia – the reasons for this shift are not yet known. 
Social science studies 
These studies are investigating social-ecological interactions related to IMTA in Indonesia and have 
focused on the development of commodity chains and how people valued their marine environment.  The 
overall intent is to advance an integrated understanding of the fisheries system (e.g., Fig. 1).  In 2015, this 
research was expanded to cover Sulawesi.  The approach included: (1) a preliminary analysis of the 
human geography of the areas of interest, (2) stakeholder mapping, which is to be followed by (3) a 
workshop for consensus building.  As a result of a change in the research duties of one of the key social 
science researchers with the Indonesia activity, Dr. Masahito Hirota, comparisons of methods to identify 
how people interact with their marine environment have been adjusted to include Thailand.  The survey 
method to identify commodity chains was also simplified so that it could be applied by people, such as 
local officers, who may not have scientific training.  An example of how this approach can be integrated 
and presented is provided in Figure 2.

Fig. 2 An example of how the simplified social survey can be presented to develop a marine commodity chain 
(from presentation by M. Hirota at the sixth PST meeting, October 14, 2015). 
Recommended activities for Year 4 (FY 2015: April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016) include: (1) a meeting to 
interpret pond experiment results, (2) an additional pond experiment, (3) analyses of existing social data 
and trial of a new format, and (4) linking social analysis with pond experiment. 
3.4 Development of the research activities in Guatemala 
The MarWeB project activities in Guatemala during Year 4 were focused on two studies: (1) a 
Community Needs Assessment of two small coastal communities in regards to social-ecological 
interactions related to small-scale shrimp aquaculture, and (2) an oyster aquaculture project (for cross-
comparisons with MarWeB activities in Indonesia). 
The Community Needs Assessment was conducted at two small coastal communities: Las Lisas and 
Monterrico.  These two communities represent extremes in community responses to the demise of the 
local fisheries.  Community members from Las Lisas were enthusiastic for change that would allow for 
the return of the resources and the survival of their community.  Community members for Monterrico 
were mostly despondent about the future – declaring themselves as the “last fishermen on earth.”  
Questions were asked that probed the demand and accessibility of fish/protein supply, and that examined 
the willingness of villagers to change their relationship with fisheries resources.  Responses indicated that 
fishermen could supply fish for their family, but not enough for community.  Protein from fresh finfish 
contributes 1–2 meals per month in Las Lisas, somewhat less for Monterrico.  As a consequence, the 
Sixth Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
182 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
communities rely on canned fish and frozen non-local products.  Fish abundances have declined over the 
last decade, and the quality of the fish caught locally has diminished; the term “contaminated” was used 
often.  There was no confidence that communities would survive with the present association with natural 
fisheries.  This response is in contrast to the positive feelings towards the sea – perhaps an acceptance that 
the sea defines their location, transport and history – but is no longer a reliable provider.  The path to the 
new economy was less clear.  Most agreed there is a need for better education.  Fishermen clearly stated 
that more education was needed. 
Recommended activities for Year 5 (FY 2016: April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017) include: 
 Community Needs Assessment to communities – presentation and feedback; 
 Establish shrimp aquaculture for transitioning to community ($5–6 K); 
 Continue oyster aquaculture project (no additional funds); 
 Explore pairing of shrimp and oyster aquaculture; 
 Visit to Guatemala, a group to include an expert(s) from the Indonesia case study. 
3.5 Case study in Palau 
A cast study visit to Palau was requested by MAFF.  Ms. Kumiko Suzuki, research scientist from the 
Japan Wildlife Research Center (JWRC) will travel to Palau in November 2015 in order to assess the 
feasibility of Palau as a study site of the MarWeB project.  After the visit, she will work with Dr. Makino 
to prepare a report summarizing the visit outcomes. 
3.6 Findings of each case and consistency among cases 
Following these case study reports, discussions focused on plans for next year, and how to integrate the 
outcomes from different case studies into the MarWeB manual and final report.  The outcomes from these 
discussions are reported in 4.1 below. 
3.7 Update on “well-being cube” work 
As Ms. Juri Hori was unable to attend this meeting, a summary of the work on the “well-being cube” was 
presented by Dr. Makino.  The “well-being cube” was developed to understand the structure of human 
well-being (HWB) in relation to the sea (i.e., in a Sato-umi context).  A short paper describing this 
approach is available in PICES Press (Hori, J. 2015. A psychological perspective on “human well-being”: 
an international comparison of the well-being structure. PICES Press 23(2): 28-30).  In Year 1, a survey 
of 1000 people in Japan was conducted to assess their relationships with the sea.  In Year 2, the same 
questionnaire was used to survey 500 people in each Korea and the United States.  In Year 3, a survey of 
200 people was conducted in collaboration with BPPT in several Indonesian provinces.  In Year 4, the 
same questionnaire was used to survey 500 people in each of China and Russia.  In Year 5 (2016), this 
survey will be conducted in Canada.

4. FINAL PRODUCTS AND SUMMARY PRESENTATIONS 
4.1 Manual development 
Three key items should be represented in the manual: 
1. Knowledge behind the tasks, including concepts, goals, concrete activities, relationships among 
activities, technical terms, etc. 
2. Procedures/steps to do the tasks, such as flowcharts, steps of each activity, tips, etc. 
3. Quality/standard for the tasks, including guidelines, criteria for judgements, qualities to be achieved, etc. 
Rather than a general manual, the MarWeB outcome manual should provide an overview of Sato-umi and 
human-environment/social-ecological systems.  It should then build from the two case studies, and 
include lessons learned and recommendations.  It should also include links to the database (case studies data, 
bibliography, etc.).  Consideration needs to be given to the intended readers of this manual, which will 
help define the manual format.  MAFF has agreed that one manual will be sufficient, which would 
include lessons learned and integration from all of the MarweB case study activities.  The expectation is 
that this manual would be posted on the PICES website, rather than printed in hard copy (although that is 
also an option for communication with local communities in Indonesia and Guatemala, in which case the 
manual would also need to be translated). 
Six steps for manual development were recommended: 
1. Clarification of objectives 
- What is the goal? Who will use it? Why is the manual needed? How/when the manual will be used? 
2. Formation of the manual writing team 
- Setting the timetable, assigning the roles for authors, management of the writing process (progress 
report, data management, sharing the manuscripts/data, share the tools/software) 
3. Development of the manual structure 
- Establishing the contents (structure of the manual), list of technical terms, concepts, basic knowledge, 
etc. 
4. Organize the manual 
- Collect/arrange the information of each part, develop the flowchart of process, define/explain the 
unit of activities, etc. 
5. Organize the judgment standard/criteria and tips for users 
- Set the judgment criteria for completing each activity, explain the matters to keep in mind, to-do 
and not-to-do, tips, develop the check list, often asked questions/mistakes, etc. 
6. Write the text 
Ms. Hori suggested putting the emphasis on the local situation, not the conceptual framework of the 
project itself, not requiring drastic changes but moderate and gradual improvements, emphasising the 
“beauty” of the goal to be achieved, and using photos of group activities (collective activities by people). 
Sixth Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
184 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
The outline for the manual was proposed as: 
1. Introduction (Concept) 
2. Why we need it? (Necessity) 
3. How to introduce it? (Procedure) 
4. How to assess it? (Quality standard) 
5. Glossary 
It was suggested that the main objective for the manual is to help local people work through their own 
specific situations towards the desired end result, under the general concept of Sato-umi (or marine 
ecosystem health and human well-being).  It could include identifying the social-natural science interface, 
discussing social science survey methods (the methods used in MarWeB differed between the two case 
studies), and comparison of integrated results between the two case studies.  An inter-sessional workshop 
was proposed to focus on the development of this manual. 
4.2 Database development 
The database could consist of a bibliography on relevant topics such as social-ecological systems, Sato-
umi, IMTA, oyster aquaculture, well-being, etc.  It could also include data from the pond (Indonesia) and 
oyster (Guatemala) experiments, data from the social surveys (Indonesia, Guatemala), and data from the 
“well-being cube” analyses (PICES member countries).  The database should also be linked to the manual, 
so that the database provides the ‘raw’ information for the manual.  The database would be small, and so, 
perhaps, could be hosted on the PICES server. 
Outstanding questions for discussion include: 
 What “topics” or “key words” should be covered by the bibliography? 
 How to conduct it? (Dr. Makino is prepared to lead this activity, but needs help for reviewing the 
product by each member country.) 
 How will the data (social and ecological data from 2 cases and cube analyses) be prepared, and by 
whom? 
 What should the database look like (structure)? 
 Timeline (Deadline March 2017) 
4.3 Possible need for an inter-sessional MarWeB meeting to work on product development 
An inter-sessional meeting was felt to be needed to focus on product development.  It was proposed to 
have this meeting in June 2016 in Victoria, Canada. 
4.4 Presentations from MarWeb at major symposia/meetings 
A MarWeB presentation at the ICES-led international symposium on “Understanding marine socio-
ecological systems: Including the human dimension in Integrated Ecosystem Assessments” (June 2016, 
Brest, France) was suggested, with the potential funding included for a speaker.  This would explain what 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Sixth Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 185 
the project is about, and raise its profile internationally.  Dr. Keith Criddle, who is also one of the 
symposium convenors, or Dr. Grant Murray were proposed to represent MarWeB. 
A MarWeb presentation at the PICES 2016 Annual Meeting was also suggested, for further discussion at 
the (possible) June 2016 inter-sessional meeting. 
5. PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
The estimated budget for the fifth year of the project (FY 2016: April 1, 2016 – March 31, 2017) is 
$60,000.  There may be a small carry-over of unspent funds from FY 2015, and this will be confirmed 
once the accounting for Year 4 has been completed.  The preliminary allocations for Year 5 are shown in 
Table 1.  It should be noted that the proposed budget does not include allocations for an inter-sessional 
PST meeting and for travel support of a MarWeB speaker to the ICES human dimensions symposium, 
and the PICES overhead, which has been paid by each of the previous financial years.  A request was 
made to use this overhead to cover the costs for the proposed inter-sessional PST meeting.

Seventh Meeting of the Project Science Team 
June 22–24, 2016, Victoria, Canada 
The seventh meeting of the Project Science Team (PST) for the PICES/MAFF project on “Marine 
Ecosystem Health and Human Well-Being” (MarWeB), funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan, through the Fisheries Agency of Japan (JFA), was held June 22–24, 2016, in 
Victoria, Canada. 
The meeting was co-chaired by Drs. Mitsutaku Makino (Japan) and Ian Perry (Canada).  The Project 
Science Team members and meeting participants are identified in Appendix 1. 
1. ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA 
The agenda was adopted as proposed (Appendix 2). 
2. INTRODUCTION TO THE MEETING 
The goal of this project is to identify the relationships between sustainable human communities and 
productive marine ecosystems in the North Pacific, under the concept of fishery social-ecological systems.  
Considering the global changes are affecting both climate and human social and economic conditions, the 
project is expected to determine: (a) how marine ecosystems support human well-being and (b) how do 
human communities support sustainable and productive marine ecosystems. 
Dr. Makino briefly reviewed the background and context for the project and pointed out that objectives for 
this meeting are to discuss: (1) the features that integrate all of MarWeB activities, in particular lessons 
learned from two case studies as to what they tell us about marine ecosystem health and human well-
being, and how to implement them in practice, and (2) the plan for the manual and the database 
development with concrete timetable.  It was noted that final products are to be submitted to MAFF/JFA 
by the end of July 2017 and that reports from previous PST meetings, annual progress and financial 
reports, and other project-related materials are available on the project’s website at 
http://meetings.pices.int/projects/marweb. 
3. PROGRESS REPORTS 
The MarWeB project has focussed on three major initiatives: 
1. Social-ecological interactions related to integrated multi-trophic aquaculture in Indonesia; 
2. Social-ecological interactions related to small-scale shrimp aquaculture in Guatemala; 
3. Development of the “well-being cube” approach to assessing national well-being related to marine 
systems. 
3.1 Case study in Guatemala 
The Guatemala case study was conducted at the locations on the Pacific Coast shown in Figure 1, and the 
following vital aspects of the studied communities were apparent:  
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Seventh Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 189 
 Seafood, in particular pelagic finfish and shrimp, is an important component of local diets; 
 ‘Fishing’ is a culturally-determining part of the community, but many in these communities 
expressed a desire to move away from such high dependence on the sea. 
Implementation of Sato-umi in Guatemala depended upon the building of trust and relationships with 
local people, and with shifting the focus from fishing to eco-tourism and other activities.  Fishermen and 
women see the future as a balance, and suggest that the next generation of fishermen should be fewer and 
better educated in sustainable business practices.  Creation of sustainable, targeted tourist activities 
requiring local expertise would provide visitors with a richer, home-grown, more comprehensive 
experience.  But how can these communities achieve this goal?  For example, what are the foundations 
that will support a sustainable project? what product development is needed? and what are the 
considerations for a community tourism project? 
Fig 1 Guatemala case study locations: Monterrico, Las Lisas and La Barrona. 
Three needs for the future were identified by the communities: (1) an economy based on tourism, (2) 
aquaculture for improving the economy and family nutrition (especially with shrimp), and (3) education, 
especially with respect to sustainable fisheries and harmony with the sea (e.g., see Fig. 2). 
 
 
 
 
Seventh Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
190 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
 
Fig. 2 Cartoon of interactions between healthy natural systems and healthy human systems in coastal regions. 
To date, the Guatemala case study has the following recommendations: 
 A healthier lifestyle can be facilitated with opportunities for better education; sustainable, 
environmentally-friendly tourism; and environmentally-considerate aquaculture opportunities. 
 Protection of the lagoon waters is essential, as these waters are breeding grounds for many major 
economically valuable species. 
 Community-wide, coordinated eco-tourism and fishing trips for tourists can be implemented to create 
a more sustainable alternative to fishing for sustenance. 
 An alternative source of fish-based food supplies must be sought, such as aquaculture. 
 The communities have a relationship with the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala and should 
work with the faculty and researchers to develop sustainable associations. 
In contrasting the MarWeB case studies, it would be helpful to describe that the studied communities are 
in different ecosystems (e.g., no seaweeds in Guatemala in contrast to Indonesia), and have different 
business context for shrimp, both within the two villages compared in Guatemala and with Indonesia. 
A second project in Guatemala concerned the culture of the Paciﬁc oyster, C. gigas in the coastal estuary 
at La Barrona.  Its primary objectives were to determine: (1) the productivity of bivalve mollusks,  
(2) growth rates and time needed for then to reach a market size, and (3) survival at different phases of 
culture.  Unfortunately, this project struggled with problems of theft of the equipment and study organisms. 
  
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Seventh Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 191 
The Guatemala case study team proposed the following workplan for 2017: 
 Engage with a UNDP (United Nations Development Program) project on “Conservation and 
sustainable use of biodiversity in coastal and marine protected areas” intended to support and expand 
the five Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) on the Pacific coast of Guatemala, and synergize the results 
of the MarWeB project with their plans to create marine protected areas in the communities of Las 
Lisas and Monterrico;  carry out a final trip to the communities to facilitate their communications with 
leaders of the UNDP project; 
 Continue the oyster project by providing further advice to the community of La Barrona (no 
additional funding is needed); 
 Contribute to the establishment of a community outreach program at the Center for the Study of the 
Sea and Aquaculture (CEMA) in Monterrico, by providing an example of how to build a sustainable 
aquaculture pond in the coastal region. 
3.2 Case study in Indonesia 
As with Guatemala, Indonesia is an under-developed country, and is relatively poor, but with a much 
larger population and better connections to the outside world.  The region of Karawang developed pond 
aquaculture about 10 years ago, but disease has since wiped out most shrimp, and the ponds have largely 
been abandoned, leaving a degraded area.  Fish are plentiful in the local markets, but are very small.  The 
MarWeB project’s focus was to identify methods to help boost economic returns for this activity and to 
reduce deleterious water quality via multi-trophic aquaculture. 
The Indonesia case study has two components: (1) a natural science-based study of improving pond 
aquaculture, and (2) a social science-based study of markets and human benefits. 
Pond experiment 
The approach was experimental, using Integrated Multi-trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) methods that are 
amenable to the low-intensity, low technology, and limited financial resource conditions of community-
scale aquaculture in Karawang, Indonesia.  The goal is to identify project outcomes that have tangible 
effects on improving human well-being in this region.  The focus here has been to optimize the balance 
between: 
 maximum harvest of the primary aquaculture product (shrimp or tilapia), 
 added income through by-production of co-cultured food or marine products, and  
 minimum excess nutrient discharge from these operations into coastal waters, which currently leads 
to degradation of coastal ecosystems. 
The 2015 experiment was more successful than in 2014 in that the Whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus 
vannamei) and Tilapia sp. showed good growth in all treatments.  The overall product yield was less than 
NCBA (National Center for Brackishwater Aquaculture) staff had hoped for (even in the controls), for 
reasons they do not know.  One difference between years was that the ponds were filled with brackish 
canal water in 2014, but brackish groundwater in 2015.  The overall health of these primary aquaculture 
products (the economic mainstays) was good up until the final few days of the experiment when signs of 
stress were observed in all ponds at equal levels (i.e., there was no correlation with treatments or controls).  
Seventh Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
192 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
Neither Gracilaria nor Anadara showed significant growth over the experiment in 2015, despite elevated 
levels of dissolve nutrients (for Gracilaria) and phytoplankton and detrital abundance (for Anadara). 
In 2016, the plan was to concentrate on shrimp aquaculture and leave out Tilapia: the shrimp IMTA 
showed a tangible profit, and the simplicity of a two species IMTA stands a better chance of being 
implemented by community growers.  Gracilaria would be used but not Anadara, because there was no 
growth of Anadara in previous experiments and it is not common in the region.  There also is anecdotal 
evidence that Gracilaria may restrict pathogen growth.  In addition, the abundance of Gracilaria in the 
ponds was increased from the current 0.1 kg/m
2
 to three treatments of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 kg/m
2
.  Gracilaria 
in the ponds was also placed on floating rafts rather than attaching it to the bottom, in an attempt to 
increase its growth by increasing the light intensities to which it is exposed. 
Social studies 
 What are the people’s needs for marine ecosystem services in Indonesia (well-being cube analysis)? 
 How can IMTA respond to these needs?  What are the ecological and social benefits to be delivered 
by IMTA? 
 How can such effects contribute to human well-being (for example, analysed using a structural 
equation modelling approach to human well-being)? 
The Indonesian case study attempted to introduce ‘change’ to the community in both the natural and 
social systems, leading to improved well-being.  Well-being here is interpreted to mean having free time 
to spend with family, and a wide variety of jobs (a varied commodity chain).  Using the well-being cube 
approach, well-being concepts for the community involved economic growth and local capacity building.  
Key words included stability, beneficial, aesthetic (e.g., food culture and variety), and the ability to change. 
The well-being cube analysis identified psychological needs for marine ecosystem services in Indonesia.  
IMTA can meet these needs by six expected effects: (1) more food, (2) safer food, (3) more jobs, (4) more 
wealth, (5) better water quality, and (6) protection of land and coastline.  These effects improve the 
human well-being as defined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005), mainly via “basic 
materials for good life”.  This leads to “freedom of choice and action” and to a broader introduction of 
IMTA etc., for producing a healthy and sustainable ecosystem for Indonesian people.  Recent studies by 
Kasperski et al. (Amber Himes-Cornell and Stephen Kasperski. 2016. Using socioeconomic and fisheries 
involvement indices to understand Alaska fishing community well-being. Coastal Management 44: 36–
70) may be useful as a guide to potential analyses of the Indonesia data. 
3.3 Case study comparisons 
The section on case study comparisons in the MarWeB scientific report could include the following 
components: 
 Features that integrate activities; 
 Lessons learned; 
 Interactions between the social and ecological systems; 
 How to implement the case studies; 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Seventh Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 193 
 Importance of community involvement, i.e. reflections on the process; 
 Recommendations; 
 Ways forward / next steps. 
Both case studies are combinations of research questions, and interventions, i.e. attempts to fix the 
identified problems (e.g., via IMTA), but there are points to recognise regarding similarities and 
differences of case studies. 
The comparison could contrast shrimp aquaculture in both countries, e.g.  
 Compare top-down versus bottom-up drivers of change, and who “sees” the presence of a social 
and/or ecological problem, and the need for solutions:  
o Indonesia:  Government “sees” the problems, and wants development and change.  Government 
is interested to enable people to put food ‘on their tables’, but also to improve environmental 
quality. The motivation in Indonesia may be to achieve a “sustainable environment”. 
o Guatemala:  Large industry “sees” no problems, and therefore is reluctant to change the existing 
processes of intensive shrimp culture.  The community need is to put food on the table on a daily 
basis.  The motivation in Guatemala may be ‘subsistence’. 
 Indonesia appears to have developed a ‘discovery – based’ process, e.g., the introduction of IMTA.  
The government plans to increase aquaculture significantly, and the concept of well-being can help 
identify non-economic consequences of such intensive aquaculture development. 
 Guatemala appears to have developed a ‘risk-averse’ process, e.g., don’t change what is working now. 
The MarWeB report should be in the PICES Scientific Reports series.  It could be organised as different 
activities, for example: 
 Large-scale comparisons of people’s responses and feelings towards the sea – i.e. well-being cube 
analyses; 
 Case study comparisons, as examples of ‘Sato-umi’ type approaches with respect to people and how 
they feel about the sea; 
 Descriptions of the manual, and database, to accompany the scientific report. 
The Introduction should address the conceptual difference (e.g., as identified in PICES Working Group 
19 report (PICES Scientific Report 37, 2010).  For example, how can we have productive and biodiverse 
marine ecosystems which include people?  PICES WG 19 concluded that concepts differ among PICES 
member countries with respect to what constitutes a ‘healthy’ ecosystem.  For example, US, Canada, Russia 
have ‘wild’ systems which they are trying to maintain; whereas Japan, Korea, China have human-dominated 
systems.  These different perceptions lead, in North America, to concepts or marine protected areas 
whose objectives are largely to protect and preserve existing (relatively undeveloped) conditions, whereas 
for East Asian nations concepts in which people are fully part of the system are more realistic goals. 
The use of a livelihoods approach could be a helpful way to compare these two case studies, which could 
also be used to contrast the importance of wild fisheries and aquaculture to these communities.  For 
example, where is each case study on the same scale of fisheries/aquaculture development?  When 
fisheries are in decline, aquaculture is often seen as an alternative.  But what are the local problems and 
Seventh Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
194 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
issues for developing such approaches?  What are the local (and social) benefits of developing integrated 
multi-trophic aquaculture? 
The report should include the following elements and considerations: 
 Features that integrate all of our activities, lessons learned, interactions between social and ecological 
systems, how to implement it, recommendations, way forward, etc.; 
 Similarities:  Problems in capture fisheries and introduction of aquaculture, including both research 
questions and interventions, key person/local point person (academic); 
 Differences:  Structure of shrimp farming industry, top-down vs. bottom-up, outsiders, livelihoods; 
 Need to be careful to define concepts correctly for local situations.  For example, the practice of 
“markets” differs between Guatemala and Indonesia.  In the former, markets are very local, for 
example using small stalls, whereas in the latter markets are larger and more diverse.  
 The Guatemala case study was highly successful at reporting back to the communities on the results 
of their ‘clicker’ surveys, and including a booklet of photos taken during the meetings (so that 
participants, and others in the villages, could show themselves present and participating in the 
meetings); 
 What can be learned from the Guatemala oyster experiment in La Barrona (and its problems) 
regarding how to apply similar experimental studies to other communities that indicate aquaculture as 
a solution? 
 From the Indonesia case study, the manual could describe how the pond experiments were conducted, 
and why they were chosen; 
 The use of the commodity chain approach, and how to create a commodity chain in the local 
community, could be a useful method to compare and contrast different case studies. 
General lessons learned: 
 Relationship building, and trust; 
 Persistence; 
 Feedback of results; 
 Investment of time and effort; 
 Building capacity of local researchers and people; 
 Successful research partnerships; 
 How do these activities help the local point-people / contacts, i.e., their personal motivations. 
Lessons learned from the Guatemala case study: 
 Clicker surveys allow anonymity, and help to overcome language and cultural barriers.  It is very 
important to carefully develop the questions to be posed to the community; 
 Collaboration is essential for decision making (not the “big daddy” approach); 
 Open mindedness and listening are critical; 
 An in-country “point person” is essential for consultations and to provide a “feedback loop” in 
regards to the activities and for interpreting the outcomes. 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Seventh Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 195 
Negative lessons learned: 
 Declining budget; 
 Lack of capacity (e.g., complex social-ecological systems modelling) – may need to provide direct 
support or direct collaborations, rather than via contracts; 
 Community leadership / directions are positive, but may make comparisons among case studies 
difficult, for example, both case studies were begun with ideas of IMTA and community support, but 
each evolved in different ways due to community interests and directions. 
The following identifies key aspects features of marine social-ecological systems, and how the compare 
between Guatemala and Indonesia:

consumption) 
Well-being, and how this was addressed or manifested differently in each case study, may provide a 
helpful integrating concept.  Where, and how, is well-being achieved?  This also relates to each 
community’s self-concept of well-being, e.g., the contrast between the different perceptions of 
community well-being between Montericco and Las Lisas in Guatemala.  This can also be compared with 
the results for well-being from the well-being cube analyses. 
4. MANUAL DEVELOPMENT 
A rather general “Manual”, providing an overview of the social-ecological systems approach and Sato-
Umi, for local government officers and researchers in developing countries is expected.  It was 
recommended to consider the manual as a PICES Advisory Report (see, as an example, the Advisory 
Report on “Fisheries and Ecosystem Responses to Recent Regime Shifts in the North Pacific” at 
http://www.pices.int/publications/brochures).  The date for submission of this report to MAFF is July 31, 2017. 
Seventh Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
196 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
The process would be to develop the longer PICES Scientific Report (as described above), from which 
core material would be extracted and reformatted as a general “how-to” manual of advisory report.  For 
example, the Advisory Report would have about 12–16 pages, many pictures, a focus on lessons learned 
and recommended approaches, with perhaps case studies and the well-being cube approach as ‘boxes’ to 
explain and highlight how things were done in these studies.  The beginning should highlight a broad 
definition of well-being, and ecosystem health, etc., and how (and why) this was implemented in this 
project.  It should also point out the importance of starting with broad questions, and then refining these 
in discussions with the local communities and/or governments.  The outcome of this process may then 
require changes to the expertise of the project team. 
Additional points to consider include:  
 Why we choose these particular case studies, and how to select case studies, i.e. criteria for selection: 
o Importance of existing connections and relationships (for example, in this project case studies 
were selected in part based on previous relationships, including those established during the 
previous MAFF-funded PICES projects) 
o Selection considered ‘degraded’ systems – therefore, we do not want to ‘sustain’ these systems, 
but to help them improve. 
 For successful projects it would essential to have: 
o Dedicated in-country co-participants, for example from the University in the case of Guatemala 
or from the state agency in the case of Indonesia; 
o A dedicated interpreter who understands the project and Project Science Team needs, as well as 
enthusiastic locals who can provide translation. 
Based on discussions and comparison of the two case studies, it was recommended that the manual 
include elements such as: 
 Local needs identification (community needs assessments, clicker survey, well-being cube analysis, 
hearings, etc.) for “healthy and sustainable ecosystems”; 
 How to define human well-being, and its complementary question about how to define healthy 
marine ecosystems; Indonesia may be a ‘more developed’ version of Guatemala in regards to 
responding to these questions; 
 Interventions:  the use of new technologies, activities, or operations (eco-tourism, oyster aquaculture, 
IMTA, education, etc.) to meet such needs; 
 Scientists / universities / government / international organizations and programs (UNDP, NGOs, etc.) 
are important for outreach and training processes; 
 “Point people” are the key to making every step successful;  
 “Trial and error” is to be expected (e.g., the Indonesia pond experiments); 
 Declines in fishing are common, as are intentions to supplement with aquaculture.  
Appendix 3 provides a first draft outline for the manual contents. 
  
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Seventh Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 197 
Manual and database development timeline: 
 Zero order draft of the Scientific Report, suggestions of the manual contents: October 3, 2016; 
 Writing the manual: November and December 2016; 
 Visit to Guatemala and Indonesia: January 2017; 
 Final draft (both Scientific Report and manual) and draft bibliography: March 31, 2017; 
 Circulate and update the bibliography, prepare the project presentations, prepare the raw data from 
two case studies: April to June 2017; 
 Submission: The end of July 31, 2017. 
5. DATABASE DEVELOPMENT 
Appendix 4 provides a first draft outline of the database contents.  This could include:  
Bibliography on relevant topics (social-ecological systems, Sato-umi, IMTA, oyster aquaculture, well-being, 
etc.):  
 List of references as a searchable Word document; 
 Published papers on a password-protected site (noting copyright issues with commercially-published 
papers); 
 References to literature cited in our MarWeB publications/reports; 
 List of key words for specific topic areas that can be used to obtain recent papers; 
 “Must-read” references for key topic areas (similar to Current Opinion in Environmental Studies 
highlighting) to be identified during report sections writing; 
 Base bibliography of well-being in English to be provided by Dr. Murray who has a student working 
on this topic. 
 Activity to be led by Dr. Makino and completed by the end of March 2017. 
Photos: 
 Lots of photos were taken during the case studies, including photos of people; 
 No problem with non-people photos, but we are likely not going to be able to post people photos due 
to privacy issues. 
Data (from the pond experiments in Indonesia and oyster experiments in Guatemala; from the social 
surveys in Indonesia and Guatemala, and from the “well-being cube” analysis in PICES member 
countries): 
 Likely no problem with posting raw data (e.g. from the ‘clicker’ surveys in Guatemala); 
 Need adequate meta-data and descriptors; 
 Need to clear posting data with case study partners; 
 Need some work to provide English translations (e.g., the well-being cube study questions from 
Japanese). 
Seventh Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
198 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
The database should be linked to the manual, so that it provides the ‘raw’ information for the manual.  
The database would be small, and so, perhaps, could be hosted on the PICES server. 
It was also agreed to build a MarWeB Final Presentation and made it available on the project website for 
all to use.  It was suggested that perhaps two presentations are needed: one more general and high-level 
and the other with more scientific details. 
6. OTHER MATTERS 
6.1 Budget and proposed allocations for Year 5 
The MAFF contribution for Year 5 of the project (April 1, 2016 – March 31, 2017) is $66,989.  Moving

6.2 Topic session proposal for PICES 2017 
A proposal for a 1-day Topic Session to be held at the 2017 PICES Annual Meeting (Vladivostok, 
Russia) will be developed by PST Co-Chairs during the summer, circulated for discussion and submitted 
through the PICES online system in September.  The session focus would be on well-being, or social-
ecological marine systems, and should include links among social and natural sciences.  Suggested 
session titles are: “Well-being in marine resources management” or “Marine ecosystem health and 
human well-being”.  Though the session description should expand beyond the scope of the project, it is 
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Seventh Meeting

expected to have two presentations from each MarWeB case study, plus an introduction and a concluding 
presentation.  Dr. Makino will contact Dr. Tetsuo Yanagi for possible contribution. 
6.3 Potential next MAFF-supported project 
A new MAFF-supported project, involving natural and social scientists, is still being developed.  The 
anticipated project duration is 3 years, with funding at the level of $100,000 CAD per year.  The project 
emphases are on capacity building in local communities, local food security, and manual development for 
social assessments, and project keywords are Sato-umi and blue growth aquaculture.  Expected case study 
locations are Indonesia and Vietnam. 
The meeting concluded at 1200 on June 24.  The next PST meeting will take place on November 2, 2016, 
in conjunction with the 25

Eighth Meeting of the Project Science Team 
November 2, 2016, San Diego, USA 
The eighth meeting of the Project Science Team (PST) for the PICES/MAFF project on “Marine Ecosystem 
Health and Human Well-Being” (MarWeB), funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
(MAFF) of Japan, through the Fisheries Agency of Japan (JFA), was held November 2, 2016, in 
conjunction with the 2016 PICES Annual Meeting in San Diego, USA. 
The meeting was co-chaired by Drs. Mitsutaku Makino (Japan) and Ian Perry (Canada).  The Project 
Science Team members and meeting participants are identified in Appendix 1. 
1. ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA 
The agenda was adopted as proposed (Appendix 2). 
2. INTRODUCTION OF THE MEETING 
The goal of this project is to identify the relationships between sustainable human communities and 
productive marine ecosystems in the North Pacific, under the concept of fishery social-ecological systems.  
Considering the global changes are affecting both climate and human social and economic conditions, the 
project is expected to determine: (a) how marine ecosystems support human well-being, and (b) how human 
communities support sustainable and productive marine ecosystems. 
The meeting objectives were to finalize: (1) the research, especially, the two case studies in Indonesia and 
Guatemala and human well-being analysis, and (2) the timetable until the end of this project, especially, 
the manual and database development. 
Reports from previous PST meetings, annual progress and financial reports, and other project-related 
materials are available on the project’s website at http://meetings.pices.int/projects/marweb. 
3. BUDGET SITUATION 
The Project Coordinator, Dr. Alexander Bychkov, noted the MarWeB project is in its final year, and all 
final reports must be submitted to MAFF by July 31, 2017.  It was suggested in discussion that a meeting 
of a few members of the Project Science Team may be needed to discuss issues that are likely to arise as 
the PICES Scientific Report and Advisory Report/Manual are being finalized.  One opportunity for a low-
cost meeting would be to hold it coincident with the Small Pelagics Symposium (March 6–11, 2017, in 
Victoria, Canada) as a number of Project Science Team members will attend that symposium or live 
nearby. 
It was recommended that some of the remaining funds for the project be made available to assist with a 
final visit to Guatemala in January–February 2017, and preparation of the final reports and assembly of 
data, photos and the bibliography that will comprise the MarWeB database.  Funding for the publication 
of the Scientific and Advisory Report is expected to come from the PICES general publication budget.

4. PROGRESS REPORTS 
The MarWeB project has focussed on three major initiatives: 
1. Social-ecological interactions related to integrated multi-trophic aquaculture in Indonesia; 
2. Social-ecological interactions related to small-scale shrimp aquaculture in Guatemala; 
3. Development of the “well-being cube” approach to assessing national well-being related to marine 
systems. 
4.1 Guatemala case study 
Conclusions to date from the Guatemala case study included: 
 Tourism is not just for visitors, but improves life for the whole community by bringing in 
opportunities for education and income for community members – women, men, children. 
 A more healthy lifestyle can be facilitated with opportunities for better education; sustainable, 
environmentally-friendly tourism; and environmentally-considerate aquaculture opportunities. 
 Protection of the lagoon waters is essential, as these waters are breeding grounds for many major 
economically valuable species. 
 Community-wide, coordinated eco-tourism and fishing trips for tourists can be implemented to create 
a more sustainable alternative to fishing for sustenance. 
 Alternative source of fish-based food supplies must be sought – such as through aquaculture. 
 The communities have a relationship with the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala and should 
work with the faculty and researchers to develop sustainable associations. 
The oyster aquaculture trial study had difficulties with theft of installations.  However, the community 
was very enthusiastic about the project.  The results obtained from the trial period demonstrate that 
culturing of C. gigas is feasible in Guatemala despite relatively low water recirculation rates and a high 
amount of suspended solids in the water column.  C. gigas can achieve the commercial market size of 70 
mm in diameter in six months; however, the system must be cleaned every 15 days in order to maintain 
and/or improve the survival rates. 
Lessons from the Guatemala case study in regards to establishing a Sato-umi type approach to people and 
the sea included: 
 The ‘clicker’ surveys allow anonymity (language and cultural barriers); 
 Collaboration is essential for decision making (not the “big daddy” approach); 
 Open mindedness and listening are critical; 
 In country constantly consulted “point person” is needed (feedback loop); 
 Oyster culture can work as an alternative to high intensity shrimp culture. 
A final visit to Guatemala is planned for February 2017, to facilitate communications among these 
communities and leaders of a United Nations Development Program (UNDP) project intended to support 
and expand the five Marine Protected Areas on the Pacific coast of Guatemala. 
Eighth Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
204 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
4.2 Indonesia case study 
Dr. Masahito Hirota presented his work on a commodity chain analysis of seafood in Karawang Province, 
and how the products from the MarWeB Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) study may 
benefit the community.  It was recommended that this material be included in the Scientific Report and 
the Advisory Report/Manual from this project.  It was also suggested that the Advisory and Scientific 
Reports comment on the common steps for social science surveys conducted in Indonesia and Guatemala 
(i.e., the commodity chain analysis in Indonesia and the community needs assessment in Guatemala), but 
also note their differences due to the different local situations. 
Dr. Mark Wells described progress in the pond experiments in Indonesia, specifically in regards to 
reducing nutrients and generating new products using an IMTA approach.  Our local MarWeB scientific 
collaborators were beginning to make positive progress, perhaps in part as a result of becoming more 
familiar with these new approaches.  A paper in the primary scientific literature is being planned. 
4.3 Well-being cube study 
Dr. Makino presented the latest results on the well-being cube study on behalf of Ms. Juri Hori.  He noted 
the recent publication of a paper on this subject: Hori, J., and Makino, M. 2016. Analysis and 
international comparison of structure of human well-being provided by marine ecosystem services. Bull. 
Japan Soc. Fish. Oceanogr., 80(3): 199–206 (in Japanese with English Abstract).  The abstract of this 
paper states: 
In order to evaluate how the marine ecosystems and social environments affect human well-being, feeling 
of satisfaction according to the five components of human well-being defined by the Millennium 
Ecosystem Assessment （Security, Basic material for good life, Health, Good social relations, and 
Freedom of choice and action) was examined by means of questionnaires.  Structural Equation Modeling 
(SEM) analysis was applied to visualize the basic structure of human well-being and to compare among 
three Asian countries （Japan, Korea and Indonesia) which are highly dependent on fisheries.  The SEM 
analysis showed that the three countries shared a common basic structure of the human well-being, with 
the five components interacting with each other.  However, the intensity of interaction between each 
component differed among the three countries.  “Good social relationship” strongly influences 
“Freedom of choice and action” as the most important component in Japan and Korea, while “Health” 
does in Indonesia.  Consideration of the differences in the structure of human well-being among the 
countries is suggested to be important for better conservation and management of marine ecosystems. 
4.4 Discussion 
The Project Science Team recommended the Scientific Report and Advisory Report should include these 
scientific outputs, possibly highlighted as boxes to the main text.  An example of Sato-umi in practice 
should be included as an additional box.  It was also noted that the relationships of marine ecosystem 
health and human well-being are place-dependent, as demonstrated for example by the outcomes of the 
well-being cube analyses and by comparisons among the three communities in the Guatemala case study.  
Therefore, there is a need to identify the local perceptions of the specific problems faced by these 
communities (and hence the importance of the community needs assessment and commodity chain analyses). 
  
Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports Eighth Meeting 
PICES Scientific Report No. 52 205 
5. MANUAL AND DATABASE DEVELOPMENT 
It was recommended that the manual focus on the format of a PICES Advisory Report.  Contents of the 
database were recommended to include:  
Bibliography on relevant topics (social-ecological systems, Sato-umi, IMTA, oyster aquaculture, well-
being, etc.):  
 List of references as a searchable Word document; 
 Published papers on a password-protected site (noting copyright issues with commercially-published 
papers); 
 List of key words for specific topic areas that can be used to obtain recent papers; 
 “Must-read” references for key topic areas (similar to Current Opinion in Environmental Studies 
highlighting) to be identified during report sections writing; 
 Base bibliography of well-being in English to be provided by Dr. Murray who has a student working 
on this topic; 
 Activity to be led by Dr. Makino and completed by the end of March 2017. 
Photos: 
 Lots of photos were taken during the case studies, including photos of people; 
 No problem with non-people photos, but we are likely not going to be able to post people photos due 
to privacy issues. 
Data (from the pond experiments in Indonesia and oyster experiments in Guatemala; from the social 
surveys in Indonesia and Guatemala, and from the “well-being cube” analysis in PICES member 
countries): 
 Likely no problem with posting raw data (e.g. from the ‘clicker’ surveys in Guatemala); 
 Need adequate meta-data and descriptors; 
 Need to clear posting data with case study partners; 
 Need some work to provide English translations (e.g., the well-being cube study questions from 
Japanese). 
6. OTHER MATTERS

Ecosystem-based fisheries management seeks to restore, enhance, and protect living resources, their 
habitats, and ecological relationships to sustain all fisheries and provide for balanced ecosystems.  
Progress has been made internationally toward adopting ecosystem-based fisheries management of 
marine systems (EBFM), with PICES countries contributing through regional applications in the North 
Pacific.  Examples are: the Study Group on Ecosystem-based management science and its application to 
the North Pacific (SG-EBM: 2003–2004) and the Working Group on Ecosystem-based management 
science and its application to the North Pacific (WG-19: 2004–2009).  Recent initiatives have expanded 
the concept of ecosystem approaches to include human influences, both positive and negative, which is 
emerging as coupled marine social-ecological studies.  An integrated understanding of how ecosystem 
changes affect human social systems and their well-being, and vice versa, is critical to improve 
environmental stewardship.  The PICES Study Group on Human Dimensions (SG-HD: 2009–2011), 
Section on Human Dimensions of Marine Systems (S-HD: 2011), and PICES-MAFF Project on “Marine 
Ecosystem Health and Human Well-Being” (MarWeB: 2012–2017) have contributed to progress in 
Eighth Meeting Appendix 3 – Project Science Team Meeting Reports 
208 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
ecosystem-based management efforts in the North Pacific.  Also, cooperation with other international 
scientific organizations and programs has been developing, such as MSEAS-2016, which was co-
sponsored by ICES, PICES, IFREMER, etc.  Key questions of that structure these scientific activities are: 
(a) How do marine ecosystems support human well-being? and (b) How do human communities support 
sustainable and productive marine ecosystems?  This session welcomes papers that address any aspect of 
marine social-ecological systems, and particularly research that focuses on the above two questions.

Background 
Several recent studies and reports suggest that increased aquaculture production is essential if we are to 
meet the growing world demands for marine protein.  However, the rapid current development of 
intensive fed aquaculture (e.g., finfish and shrimp), in both developed and developing countries, has 
generated concerns about the environmental impacts of these often monospecific practices.  To help 
address such issues, integrated multi- trophic aquaculture (IMTA) has been attracting global attention as a 
means to conduct aquaculture activities, while at the same time improving/rehabilitating coastal 
environmental conditions and improving the well-being of the people living in coastal areas.  By integrating 
fed aquaculture with inorganic and organic extractive aquaculture (seaweed and invertebrates), the wastes 
of one resource become a resource (fertilizer or food) for the others.  This “ecosystem-like” approach 
provides nutrient bioremediation capabilities, mutual benefits to the co-cultured organisms, economic 
diversification by production of other value-added marine products, and increased profitability and food 
security for the local community.  This session seeks contributions and case studies of how to implement 
and conduct IMTA activities, in particular that reduce negative impacts to the quality of the local 
environment and improve the well-being of the local human communities.  Examples of activities in 
tropical and semi-tropical locations are particularly welcome, as well as examples of general methods and 
approaches that can be applied in many different environments.  This session is a contribution of, and 
towards, the work of the PICES project on “Marine Ecosystem Health and Human Well-Being (MarWeB)”. 
Summary of presentations 
This session was convened on October 22, and started with the introduction by Dr. Masahito Hirota (Japan), 
stating that the objective of the session is to seek how to implement and conduct IMTA effectively, and 
contribute to PICES-MAFF MarWeB project.  A total of 8 presentations (6 oral and 2 posters) were 
made, and about 25 participants actively discussed the social and ecological aspects of IMTA. 
The first invited speaker, Dr. Thierry Chopin (Canada) reviewed the IMTA concept and the history of 
IMTA.  He introduced many cases demonstrating that IMTA is extremely flexible in terms of component 
species, location, objectives, etc., and discussed various ways of utilizing IMTA for more efficient nutrient 
recycling in the sustainable society, including a social system of Nutrient Trading Credit (NTC) that is 
similar to carbon trading credit (CTC).

PICES Scientific Report No. 52 211 
The second invited speaker, Dr. Mark Flaherty (Canada) focused on the social aspects of IMTA.  He 
reviewed the aquaculture controversy in British Columbia (BC), where the development of aquaculture in 
coastal areas has been the subject of longstanding increasingly polarized debate of a wide rage of 
stakeholders.  There is a great social resistance in some quarters to the commercial aquaculture of salmon.  
Many coastal communities, especially that of the First Nations, believe that the wild salmon fishery is 
more important and oppose commercial salmon aquaculture.  However, some First Nations communities 
embrace aquaculture as an important source of jobs and economic development.  Based on the interview 
conducted in BC, he discussed how improved understanding of IMTA by First Nation people can be 
facilitated. 
Dr. Mark Wells (USA) discussed the ongoing MAFF-funded IMTA experimental study in Karawang, 
Indonesia.  The IMTA in this case includes shrimp/tilapia, Gracilaria and Anadara.  Based on the results 
of the IMTA pond experiment, there were no negative effects on the production of shrimp and tilapia.  
The effects on water quality (N, P, Si, Chl) was also discussed.  He reported the shrimp-only pond was 
damaged by the white-spot disease, while IMTA pond was not.  Though it is tempting to suggest that 
IMTA may have contributed to white spot resistance, there is no direct evidence for this effect. 
In his invited talk, Dr. Suhendar Sachoamer (Indonesia) reviewed the Blue Economy Policy and 
dissemination of the Sato-umi concept and IMTA activities in his country.  In Indonesia, the huge issue is 
the erosion of land because of the destruction of the mangrove forest for making shrimp aquaculture pond 
and abandonment of the ponds after the white-spot disease.  IMTA can be a tool to rehabilitate the 
diseased aquaculture pond, to re-create jobs for coastal communities, and to protect the coastline against 
the erosion. 
The final invited speaker, Dr. Susanna Nurdjaman (Indonesia), presented the many issues relating to the 
aquaculture in Indonesia, such as diseases, mangrove destruction, coastal water degradation, biosecurity, 
etc.  She emphasized the difficulty of changing the mindset of the local people, but suggested that the 
concept of Sato-Umi (harmony of coastal human life and the coastal ecosystem biodiversity) can be a 
clue.  She also presented her future plan on the material circulation model. 
Mr. Emmanuel Sweke (Japan) introduced a social-ecological systems study on the coastal fisheries in the 
Eastern part of Hokkaido, Japan.  Using data from the Akkeshi area and the Erimo area, he discussed 
cumulative effects from the climate change (sea surface temperature), boat size, demography, local 
people’s perception to the local fisheries. 
Dr. B.A. Venmathi Maran (Korea) presented a poster on how climate change may affect the distribution 
of tropical and subtropical fishes, and their associated parasite fauna, and the implications of this process 
for Korea’s lucrative sea-cage aquaculture industry.  He highlighted that the parasitic copepod and 
monogenean fauna of marine fishes is relatively well documented in the neighboring countries, but very 
little is known about parasitic copepods infecting marine fish on the Korean peninsula. 
Dr. Konstantin Drozdov’s poster was on the accumulation of lactate in the coelomic fluid of sea urchins 
under conditions of hypoxia.  This accumulation from the anaerobic digestion of glucose is an indicator 
that sea urchins are capable of anaerobic metabolism. 
The discussion part of the session was chaired by Dr. Wells and included a wide range of issues such as 
the influences from legal regulations, societal perception of IMTA, acceptability by the commercial 
farmers, differences between Asia and the Western World, effects and scale of nutrient reduction, etc. 
PICES-2014 Appendix 4 – Session Descriptions and Summaries at PICES Annual Meetings 
212 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
Some overall comments: 
 The social dimension acceptance of IMTA differs greatly between developed and developing 
countries.  The latter are ready to accept new methods that can be demonstrated to have limited 
negative environmental effects, while strong resistance to IMTA is routed in some developed 
countries, fueled in large part by media rather than scientific dissemination. 
 Implementation of IMTA may be easier in developing countries; limitations in some developed 
countries (Canada in particular) are due to the highly restrictive regulatory environment policies. 
 For the environmental benefits, regulations surrounding IMTA must be followed by enforcement 
actions.  This may be problematic in some developing countries.

Background 
Description 
Ecosystem-based fisheries management seeks to restore, enhance, and protect living resources, their 
habitats, and ecological relationships to sustain all fisheries and provide for balanced ecosystems.  
Progress has been made internationally toward adopting ecosystem-based fisheries management of 
marine systems (EBFM), with PICES countries contributing through regional applications in the North 
Pacific.  Examples are the Study Group on Ecosystem-based management science and its application to 
the North Pacific (SG-EBM: 2003-2004) and the Working Group on Ecosystem-based management 
science and its application to the North Pacific (WG-19: 2004-2009).  Recent initiatives have expanded 
the concept of ecosystem to include human influences, both positive and negative, which is emerging as 
coupled marine social-ecological studies.  An integrated understanding of how ecosystem changes affect 
human social systems and their well-being, and vice versa, is critical to improve environmental 
stewardship.  The PICES Study Group on Human Dimensions (SG-HD: 2009-2011), Section on Human 
Dimensions of Marine Systems (S-HD: 2011-2016), and PICES-MAFF Project on “Marine Ecosystem 
Health and Human Well-being” (MarWeB: 2012-2017) have contributed to ecosystem-based management 
efforts in the North Pacific.  Also, cooperation with other international scientific organizations/programs 
has been developing, such as MSEAS 2016 which was co-sponsored by PICES, ICES, IFREMER, etc. 
Key questions that structure these scientific activities are: (a) how do marine ecosystems support human 
well-being? and (b) how do human communities support sustainable and productive marine ecosystems? 
This Topic Session welcomes papers that addresses all aspects of marine socio-ecologic systems, and 
particularly research that addresses the above two questions.

New PICES MAFF-Sponsored Project on 
“Marine Ecosystem Health and Human Well-Being” 
 
by R. Ian Perry and Mitsutaku Makino 
 
Progress is being made internationally on an ecosystem 
approach to the management of marine systems, in 
particular as applied to ecosystem-based fisheries 
management (EBFM; FAO 2003; Hollowed et al. 2011).  
PICES has contributed to this progress and explored 
regional applications to the North Pacific, through the 
activities of the ecosystem-based management Study Group 
and Working Group reports (Jamieson et al. 2005, 2010).  
Recent initiatives at the global level have expanded the 
concept of ecosystem approaches to include people in what 
have been called coupled marine social-ecological systems 
(e.g., De Young et al. 2008; Ommer et al. 2011).  PICES 
has also contributed to these initiatives (Makino and 
Fluharty 2011) and has recently formed an expert group to 
develop the human dimensions of marine ecosystems 
(Section on Human Dimensions, http://www.pices.int/ 
members/sections/S-HD.aspx).  The second PICES integrative 
program, FUTURE (Forecasting and Understanding Trends, 
Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific Marine 
Ecosystems), also has significant activities and strong 
linkages with ecosystems and people, through its Advisory 
Panels on Anthropogenic Influences on Coastal Ecosystems 
(AP-AICE; http://www.pices.int/members/advisory_panels/ 
AICE-AP.aspx) and on Status, Outlooks, Forecasts and 
Engagement (AP-SOFE; http://www.pices.int/members/ 
advisory_panels/SOFE-AP.aspx). 
 
Very recently, the concept of human well-being within 
marine social-ecological systems has become recognized as 
an important step forward (Coulthard et al. 2011; Charles 
2012).  Well-being shifts the perspective from objective 
measures of sustainable livelihoods (comprised of the 
physical, social, human, natural, and financial resources 
available to a community or country) to include the subjective 
or perceived well-being of individuals and communities.  
This represents a shift from people as exploiters of the 
ocean to people as integral components of resource 
sustainability and ecosystem health (Coulthard et al. 2011; 
Charles 2012).  Therefore, taking account of the dynamics 
of livelihoods and the concept of well-being can help with 
the development of policies supporting sustainable and 
resilient marine social-ecological systems (Charles 2012). 
 
The Japanese concept of sato-umi represents one version of 
this humans-in-nature approach, in which a healthy 
ecosystem is seen to nourish human well-being, but human 
activities are seen as necessary for sustaining ecosystem 
health (Fig. 1).  Sato means community or village, and umi 
means sea.  Therefore, sato-umi refers to marine 
environments that have long-standing relationships with 
human communities, and in which human interactions have 
resulted in high marine productivity and biodiversity 
(Makino 2011, p. 126; Makino and Fluharty 2011).  The 
activities to re-establish and promote the recovery of sea 
grass beds that have been undertaken by local community 
members near Yokohama are one example.  Comparable 
types of sea grass and kelp restoration activities have been 
proposed by local communities in the Strait of Georgia, 
Canada.  The Japanese government has undertaken 
integrated studies to assess the contributions of social, 
cultural, economic, and ecological aspects in sato-umi type 
projects in Japan (Yanagi 2012). 
 
Fig. 1 Image of sato-umi (coastal village and sea): fishing villages, 
fisheries operations, aquaculture, swimming, shellfish gathering, 
sport fishing (angling), nature observation, urban area, etc.

umi Assessment). 
 
As a result of generous funding provided by the government 
of Japan, through its Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries (MAFF), PICES has developed a new project to 
explore these issues of marine social-ecological systems 
and sato-umi in the North Pacific.  The goal of this PICES 
project on “Marine ecosystem health and human well-being” 
is to identify the relationships between sustainable human 
communities and sustainable marine ecosystems in the 
North Pacific, under the concept of fishery social-
ecological systems.  Specifically, considering the global 
changes in climate and human social and economic 
conditions, the project is expected to answer the following 
questions: (a) how do marine ecosystems support human 
well-being? and (b) how do human communities support 
sustainable and productive marine ecosystems? 
 
This goal links directly with the PICES FUTURE Research 
Theme 3 on “How do human activities affect coastal 
ecosystems and how are societies affected by changes in 
these ecosystems?”, specifically questions 3.1 (What are 
PICES Press Articles Appendix 5 
216 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
the dominant anthropogenic pressures in coastal marine 
ecosystems and how are they changing?) and 3.3 (How do 
multiple anthropogenic stressors interact to alter the 
structure and function of these systems, and what are the 
cumulate effects?).  In addition, the project will integrate, 
support, and expand on the activities of several PICES 
expert groups, including the new Section on Human 
Dimensions, and Working Group 28 on Development of 
Ecosystem Indicators to Characterize Ecosystem Responses 
to Multiple Stressors. 
 
A Task Team was established for the project, which had its 
first meeting at the 2012 PICES Annual Meeting in Hiroshima, 
Japan (Fig. 2).  The meeting reviewed the outputs of this 
project that are expected by the government of Japan, and 
outlined the approach and a broad plan for implementation 
of the project over the next 5 years.  The expected outputs 
include: selection of study sites in Southeast Asia, oceanic 
Pacific islands, and Central America (3 sites in total); 
research on ecosystem health and human well-being; 
workshops at each site; and construction of a database, for 
example, of case studies of where and how a social-ecological 
(sato-umi) systems approach may be applied.  Workshops 
will be held in three developing countries around the North 
Pacific to explore their use of marine social-ecological 
(sato-umi) concepts in marine activities, and to develop 
training manuals for the application of such concepts to 
help improve the sustainability of both natural marine 
ecosystems and their dependent human communities.  The 
three countries proposed as main case studies are Indonesia 
(large population, aquaculture-intensive), Palau (finfish 
capture fishery focus; existing networks of community-
based fisheries) and Guatemala (upwelling system; finfish 
and aquaculture).  The main question to be asked is what 
tools can PICES provide these countries with respect to 
developing a social-ecological (sato-umi) approach to 
marine systems.  The key outcome will be to provide an 
approach and tools that advance the following types of 
‘integrated social-ecological assessments’: 
 What are the general concepts leading to sustainable 
human communities and productive marine ecosystems? 
 Where does each country and local community ‘want’ 
to be within these concepts? 
 Where are they now? 
 What are the major stresses, for example climate 
change, and how might these affect the current state 
and the transitions to the desired state? 
 How does human well-being relate to ecosystem 
services in these countries and locations? 
 
One tool, from psychological research, that will be 
explored is called the “well-being cube”.  At the meeting in 
Hiroshima, Drs. Juri Hori and Mitsutaku Makino presented 
definitions for human well-being from psychological 
research, and described the concept of the “well-being 
cube”.  In this approach, a person’s (or community, region, 
or country) perception of their well-being can be located in 
one or more of 27 cells defined by three axes, each with

their situation, their level of active response to their situation, 
and their view of how they fit into their world (Fig. 3).

The first workshop is being organized for Indonesia in 
March of 2013.  Indonesia already has some knowledge 
and experience with the sato-umi concept as applied to 
coastal aquaculture and local community systems.  The 
goal of this first workshop will be to use broad scientific 
and local knowledge to develop the contents of a manual 
on this approach for use in other coastal communities of 
Indonesia, and to assess the applicability of scientific tools 
for describing and applying these concepts in real situations.  
The results of this experience will be presented and 
discussed at the second meeting of the project Task Team, 
scheduled for June 2013. 
 
This 5-year MAFF-sponsored PICES project is planned to 
provide many opportunities to test and support the activities  
 
and contributions of several PICES expert groups and the 
FUTURE program.

PICES-MAFF Project on Marine Ecosystem Health and Human Well-Being: 
Indonesia Workshop 
 
by Mitsutaku Makino 
 
Background 
 
In April 2012, PICES began a 5-year project on Marine 
Ecosystem Health and Human Well-Being funded by the 
Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries of Japan 
(MAFF).  The goal of the project is to identify relationships 
between sustainable human communities and productive 
marine ecosystems in the North Pacific under the concept 
of fishery social-ecological systems.  In Japan, this concept 
is known as the sato-umi fisheries management system.  It 
recognizes that global changes are affecting both climate 
and human social and economic conditions.  Key questions 
of the project are: a) How do marine ecosystems support 
human well-being? and b) How do human communities 
support sustainable and productive marine ecosystems?  
The project will be directed by a Project Team, co-chaired 
by Drs. Mitsutaku Makino (Fisheries Research Agency, 
Japan) and Ian Perry (Fisheries and Oceans Canada). 
 
At its first meeting (October 11, 2012, in Hiroshima, 
Japan), the Project Team decided to conduct two 
workshops in developing countries in each of three regions 
of the North Pacific (Southeast Asia, Pacific oceanic 
islands, and Central America).  Indonesia was selected 
because of its large population and aquaculture-intensive 
industry.  Palau was chosen because of its focus on finfish 
capture fisheries and its existing networks of community-
based fisheries.  Finally, Guatemala was selected because 
its coastline features an upwelling system favourable for 
finfish fisheries and aquaculture. 
 
GEMPITA-SPL concept in Indonesia 
 
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application 
of Technology (BPPT) has developed a concept of 
managing coastal and marine resources in a balanced, 
harmonious, integrated, and productive environment by 
actively involving the community.  Their concept is called 
GEMPITA-SPL (Gerakkan Masyarakat Peduli Kelestarian 
Sumberdaya Perikanan, Pesisir dan Laut) or in the English 
language version as SFiCoMS (Sustainable Utilization of 
Fisheries, Coastal and Marine Resources for the Society).  
The GEMPITA-SPL concept has been implemented in the 
northern coastal area of West Java by BPPT and the local 
Department of Fisheries and Marine Affairs.  It fosters the 
development and promotion of environmentally friendly 
aquaculture technology using Integrated Multi-Trophic 
Aquaculture (IMTA).  This approach features concepts of 
bio-recycling in idle and/or marginal brackish water ponds 
in the northern part of western Java.  Coastal areas that had 
been damaged by shrimp monoculture are being 
transformed into productive systems that feature a balanced 
and harmonious approach and greater biodiversity to 
improve the welfare of local communities.  This concept 
fits very well within the framework of fishery social-
ecological systems in the PICES-MAFF project. 
 
Indonesia workshop 
 
The first PICES-MAFF project workshop was held on 
March 13–14, 2013, with a total of 93 participants from 
Indonesia, Japan, and the United States of America.  
Indonesia was represented by the Ministry of Marine 
Affairs and Fisheries, Ministry of Research and Technology, 
Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Public Works, 
Coordinating Ministry for the Economy, Finance and 
Industry, Coordinating Ministry for People’s Welfare, 
Ministry of Development of Disadvantaged Areas, Ministry 
for National Development Planning, Food Security Agency 
of the Ministry of Agriculture, Bandung Institute of 
Technology, Bogor Agriculture University, and local 
governments.  The objectives of the workshop were: 
 To develop the contents of a manual that will describe 
GEMPITA-SPL experiences in Java province according 
to local conditions in some candidate sites; 
 To assess the utility of PICES’ scientific tools for 
enhancing the human well-being of local communities 
and for rehabilitating coastal ecosystems in some 
candidate sites. 
 
The first day of the workshop was spent at the Main 
Commission Hall of BPPT headquarters in Jakarta.  It started 
with a welcome by Ms. Nenie Yustiningsih (Director of the 
Center for Agricultural Production Technology of BPPT), 
  
 
Dr. Mitsutaku Makino (mmakino@affrc.go.jp) co-chairs the PICES Section on Human Dimensions of Marine Ecosystems and co-leads 
the PICES-MAFF project on “Marine ecosystem health and human well-being”.  His major scientific interests are institutional and 
economic analysis of marine policies, including fisheries management and ecosystem-based management.  He is currently the Head of 
the Fisheries Management Group at the National Research Institute of Fisheries Science, Fisheries Research Agency of Japan, and a 
member of many international research activities such as the IUCN Commission of Ecosystem Management (CEM) Fisheries Expert 
Group (FEG), IMBER Human Dimension Working Group, United Nations University Sustainable Ocean Initiative.  Also, he is now 
serving as an editor of ICES Journal of Marine Science as well as a Scientific Committee member of the Japanese Society of Ocean 
Policy.

followed by opening remarks and introduction by  
Dr. Makino (Fig. 1).  The keynote speech was made by 
Professor Tetsuo Yanagi from Kyushu University, Japan.  
The opening of the workshop was declared by Dr. Listyani 
Wijayanti (Deputy Chairman of BPPT).  A total of 10 
presentations were given on this day.  A Project Team 
member, Dr. Mark Wells (University of Maine, U.S.A.; 
Fig. 2) described previous activities of PICES in Indonesia 
and suggested ways that PICES science can support 
GEMPITA-SPL.  Another member of the Project Team, 
Dr. Masahito Hirota (National Research Institute of 
Fisheries Science, Fisheries Research Agency, Japan) 
talked about how PICES scientific tools can support the 
analysis of well-being in the coastal societies (Fig. 2). 
 
The second day featured a field trip to the Karawan area of 
West Java, where the BPPT has developed GEMPITA-
SPL.  Participants visited the Center for Brackishwater and 
Marine Culture of West Java Province and the National 
Center for Brackishwater Aquaculture to observe aquaculture 
ponds that applied the GEMPITA-SPL approach, and had 
discussions with local stakeholders (fishers, managers, etc.). 
 
The workshop attracted serious attention from the Indonesian 
media, with many reports appearing in newspapers, on TV 
and web news (Fig. 3). 
 
Results and next steps 
 
Discussions following the workshop led to the idea of a 
Letter of Intent (LOI) between PICES and BPPT to 
recognize the benefits to their respective institutions of 
establishing international links (Fig. 3).  The second output 
was a draft list of parameters to assess GEMPITA-SPL 
performance.  In close coordination with Indonesian 
scientists, PICES scientists will support the assessment of 
these parameters in sample ponds where GEMPITA-SPL 
has been implemented.  A table of contents for a 
GEMPITA-SPL manual was drafted to facilitate the 
dissemination of GEMPITA-SPL activities in Indonesia.  
These will be discussed at the second meeting of the 
PICES-MAFF Project Team to be held June 11–12, 2013, 
in Honolulu.  Based on the advice and comments from this 
meeting, a second Indonesian workshop will be held 
around March 2014.

A psychological perspective on “human well-being”: 
An international comparison of the well-being structure 
 
by Juri Hori 
 
Introduction 
 
“Well-being” involves peoples’ positive evaluations of their 
lives, such as positive emotions, engagement, satisfaction, 
and meaning (Diener and Seligman, 2004; Oscar, 2011).  
According to the definition by the Millennium Ecosystem 
Assessment (MA), human well-being (HWB) has multiple 
constituents including security, basic material for a good life, 
health, good social relations and freedom of choice and 
action (Fig. 1). 
 
 
Fig. 1 Linkages between Ecosystem Services and Human Well-being 
(Ecosystems and human well-being: Synthesis report, 2005). 
The PICES Section on Human Dimensions of Marine 
Systems (S-HD) is conducting a study on how HWB relates 
to marine ecosystem services in the North Pacific.  This 
research is a part of a 5-year project on “Marine Ecosystem 
Health and Human Well-Being” (MarWeB) supported by 
the by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
(MAFF) of Japan. 
 
How do we measure HWB? 
 
Many social and psychological methodologies have 
contributed to a better understanding of one’s sense of 
value or well-being.  While economists focus mainly on 
economic utility or material wealth (Stevenson et al., 
2008), psychologists have been concentrating more on 
cultural values in individualism (Diener et al., 1993; 
Hofstede, 2001; Diener and Seligman, 2002).  
 
Here, we present results from two approaches for assessing 
HWB.  First, we measured people’s levels of “satisfaction” 
using the MA’s five components of HWB as dependent 
variables (see Fig. 1, right-hand panel) and analyzed the 
inter-relationships among them.  Second, we developed the 
“Well-being CUBE”, composed of 35 “human needs” 
determined by psychology, which can evaluate the detailed 
characteristics of people’s desired choices and actions (Fig. 2).

Method 
 
We measured the five components of the MA’s HWB 
using 20 items.  Each item was answered on a 1 to 5 scale 
ranging from “Very Dissatisfied” to “Very Satisfied”.  The 
Well-being CUBE (Fig. 2) was assessed using 35 items 
scored on a scale ranging from 1 to 5 (“Very Dissatisfied” 
to “Very Satisfied” and “No Expectation” to “High 
Expectation”).  
 
The first survey of 1000 people in Japan was conducted in 
2012 to assess their relationships with the sea and to further 
develop a methodology.  In 2013, the same questionnaire 
was used to survey 500 people in Korea and the United 
States.  In 2014, we carried out a survey of 200 people in 
Indonesia.  
 
The results from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) 
analysis showed that each country has the same structure of 
the MA’s HWB, but the primary paths to “freedom of 
choice and action” differ from country to country (Fig. 3).  
In the SEM, the structural model includes the relationships 
among the latent constructs.  In Figure 3, one-headed 
arrows represent regression relationships, while the two-
headed arrow represents correlational relations. 
 
Preliminary results and next steps 
 
The results from the Well-being CUBE analysis are 
summarized in Figure 4.  Red shows high-expectation and 
satisfaction need, blue is low-expectation and satisfaction 
need, yellow is high-expectation and low-satisfaction need, 
and green is low-expectation and high-satisfaction need.  
Clear differences are evident among the four sampled 
countries. 
 
Some initial findings include the fact that all countries 
surveyed have similar general concepts of HWB with 
regard to marine ecosystems.  However, the specific 
understanding of how the marine ecosystem affects HWB 
differs among the countries and, therefore, what makes for 
a desirable relationship between people and the sea is 
different among countries.  In order to grasp the big picture 
of HWB in the North Pacific, we are planning to collect 
data in the rest of the PICES member countries (Canada, 
China, and Russia) and in Guatemala within the lifespan of 
the MarWeB project.

A good relationship between local communities and seafood diversity 
 
by Masahito Hirota 
 
Background 
 
Brackish waters, especially shrimp pond cultures, have been 
widely developed since the 1980s in South East Asian 
countries.  However, deforestation for building ponds, and 
later, their abandonment due to mass diseases in cultures, 
have resulted in serious environmental degradation.  Now, 
these problems are becoming a threat to the livelihood of 
the local inhabitants, giving rise to social instability at the 
local community level.  To consider how to rectify this 
condition, the PICES Section on Human Dimensions of 
Marine Systems, in collaboration with the Agency for the 
Assessment and Application of Technology (Badan 
Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknologi, BPPT) of Indonesia, 
is studying the use of an environmentally friendly 
aquaculture technology called Integrated multiple trophic 
aquaculture (IMTA – a method of aquaculture in which 
fish, scallop and seaweed are managed tropically by bio-
recycling so that the by-products from one species are used 
as food or fertilizer for another) to remediate the 
environment while applying a social science approach by 
working together with the local community.  This research 
is a part of a 5-year project on “Marine Ecosystem Health 
and Human Well-Being” (MarWeB) supported by the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) of 
Japan. 
 
Activities 
 
A work plan has been developed for a MarWeB-sponsored 
pond experiment, to be conducted at the National Center 
for Brackishwater Aquaculture in Karawang (Java Island, 
east from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta).  The main purpose 
this experiment is to investigate the effects of IMTA on the 
economic return of pond operations, and the pond water 
quality defined in terms of macronutrient concentrations.  
The hypothesis being studied is whether the addition of 
bivalves and seaweed into the aquaculture ponds of fish or 
shrimp will allow successful growth of all species, and 
decrease the macronutrient concentrations in the pond waters. 
 
To build the skills needed to conduct the pond experiment, 
a nutrient and phytoplankton training workshop, led by 
Drs. Mark Wells and Mitsutaku Makino, was held March 
25–26, 2014, at the National Center for Brackishwater 
Aquaculture.  Sixteen local Indonesian scientists participated 
(Fig. 1).  The workshop was a success, with the objectives 
fully met and the methodological skills raised to the quality 
required for publication of the pond experiment results. 
 
Using a social science approach, a commodity chain map of 
the IMTA products in the Karawang area (Fig. 2) has been 
prepared to assess what kind of businesses are locally 
supported, who consumers are, and how much is consumed 
of the multi-species produced from the IMTA (shrimps, 
milkfish, crab, etc.).  We expect that, by changing shrimp 
monoculture to IMTA, it will be possible to retain 
sustainable pond culture, and suppress coastal erosion.  In 
addition, there is high probability this will lead to new 
diverse job creations, and will ensure a rich variety of 
seafood as ingredients of everyday life in the community. 
 
Spreading information on the effects of IMTA to the 
community 
 
To establish IMTA, it is indispensable that communities 
receive correct and comprehensive information about this 
approach. Of course, shrimp monoculture is highly 
profitable and is an important source of employment, but to 
ensure sustainability, it is critical to present a well-balanced 
understanding of the IMTA benefits to the local population.

workshops in Indonesia in March 2013 and March 2014 
(for a review of the first workshop see PICES Press, 2013, 
Vol. 21, No. 2, pp. 18–19).  These workshops drew not 
only local and international scientists, concerned with 
pond aquaculture, but also attracted special attention of 
the Indonesian press.  Through the mass media, we have 
successfully raised the awareness of the general public 
about seafood sustainability.  For the future, it is expected 
that the Indonesian community will establish and lead 
local IMTA programs in order to rectify their own well-
being.

Moving towards more sustainable shrimp and tilapia aquaculture in  
Karawang, Indonesia 
 
by Mark L. Wells, Mitsutaku Makino, and Masahito Hirota and Ian Perry 
 
Marine and brackish water aquaculture provides much of 
the world’s shrimp and fish supplies to markets (FAO, 
2014) and represents a growing source of nutrition and 
economic strength in developing nations. This situation is 
particularly true for Indonesia which is undertaking an 
enormous expansion of pond aquaculture development over 
the next several years.  However, large-scale pond 
aquaculture introduces large quantities of nitrogen and 
phosphorus into coastal waters. The challenge for Indonesia 
will be to achieve this expansion without eutrophication of 
coastal regions, and the resulting devastation to the natural 
cultural, fisheries and tourism resources. 
 
Brackish water pond aquaculture can be broadly separated 
into two strategies: high intensity systems having shrimp 
densities, for example, from 300-400 per m
3
, and low 
intensity pond systems at an order of magnitude lower 
densities.  High intensity systems offer high economic 
returns but require relatively large initial investment, and 
hyper-strict controls of growth and feeding conditions to 
avoid disaster, akin to a high-wire acrobatic act. Once these 
requirements have been successfully met, there is little 
incentive to experiment with these lucrative operations to 
mitigate nutrient waste generation.   
 
Low intensity pond aquaculture, on the other hand, is a 
“lower tech” approach where conditions can stray more 
from the knife edge constraints of high intensity 
aquaculture system operations. This greater leeway in pond 
conditions makes low intensity growing operations more 
widespread, where they dominate the aquaculture industry 
in many developing nations. This is particularly true for 
most Indonesian growers. 
 
As part of its work to develop an expanded concept of 
ecosystem approaches which includes people (Social-
Ecological Systems approach), the PICES Marine 
Ecosystem Health and Human Well-being (MarWeB; see 
Perry and Makino, 2013) project has been testing 
approaches to multitrophic aquaculture in Indonesia. This 
project is funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan through the Fisheries 
Research Agency of Japan (FRA). The PICES project team 
is collaborating with the Agency for the Assessment and 
Application of Technology (BPPT), Indonesia, and the 
National Center for Brackishwater Aquaculture, Karawang, 
Indonesia. The purpose of the project has been to 
incorporate the macroalga Gracilaria and the clam 
Anadara into shrimp and tilapia pond aquaculture (i.e., co-
culture) and to evaluate their effects on dissolved nutrient 
concentrations in pond waters. Co-culture methods, where 
species are mixed within the pond, are more challenging 
than sequential pond systems (i.e., a product pond and a 
mitigation pond) but are far more practical if the right 
formula can be developed. A secondary benefit of 
multitrophic aquaculture is that the pond by-products, in 
this case harvestable biomass of Gracilaria and Anadara, 
can provide additional economic benefits to growers, 
greater nutrition and job creation to the surrounding 
communities, which themselves cannot afford the shrimp 
produced for export markets. 
 
The two experiments performed to date have provided 
good insights to the operational and scientific challenges of 
co-culturing shrimp and tilapia with macroalgae and 
bivalves.  Brackishwater ponds in the experimental system 
range from 1000–4000 m
2
 in area but with a depth of 1 m 
(Fig. 1). These systems are maintained to prevent light 
from reaching the pond floor (to avoid the massive growth 
of aquatic grasses), have high trophic transfer efficiencies 
(e.g., 1 kg of tilapia produced per 1.3 kg of feed added), but 
still generate high excess nutrient loads (~0.1 mole N/L, or  
approximately 10,000 times that in coastal waters).  
 
The initial project goals have been to establish methods of 
co-culture that do not jeopardize the health or production of 
shrimp and tilapia.  Results from the two experiments to 
date clearly show no detrimental health effects from co-
culturing (Fig. 2) and indeed fish production may be 
slightly greater in the presence of seaweed and bivalves. It 
seems clear that, at least at the levels used in our 
experiments, farmers can benefit using the multitrophic 
strategy by increasing the economic yield in their ponds.

shrimp, attracted to the bottom placed net with food, are raised 
by hand to measure their size and appearance as an indication of 
their health.  
 
The impact of co-culture on reducing dissolved nutrient 
levels has been less successful. Analysis of the last 
experiment completed in November 2015 is still underway, 
but the co-culture conditions appear not to have 
significantly decreased dissolved nutrient concentrations. A 
lower ratio of Gracilaria and Anadara to product (shrimp 
or tilapia biomass) was used in these initial experiments to 
minimize the chance of negative impacts. The next 
experiment planned for 2016 will test the effects of higher 
quantities of algae and bivalves.  
 
A positive outcome of the multitrophic strategy was the 
creation of a phytoplankton assemblage dominated by 
diatoms, relative to dominance by flagellates in the 
standard, product-only ponds.  Diatom-dominated pond 
systems are coveted because they impart desirable flavour 
characteristics that bring higher prices.  
 
A major challenge to scientists working to increase the 
sustainability of low intensity brackishwater pond 
aquaculture is that the individuals and community 
organizations operating these farms are critically dependent 
on their success.  Failed experiments can have drastic real-
world impacts on these communities.  Working with our 
colleagues at BPPT and the National Center for 
Brackishwater Aquaculture in Karawang has provided an 
important venue to facilitate the development of strategies 
for more sustainable pond aquaculture, and through their 
interactions with local farmers help to implement these 
practices in the future.

A community needs assessment for coastal Guatemala –  
Balancing ocean and human health 
 
by Vera L. Trainer, Charles G. Trick and William P. Cochlan 
 
Background 
 
In collaboration with our colleagues at the Universidad de 
San Carlos de Guatemala, we have engaged in a series of 
conversations with community members from two villages 
along the Pacific coast of Guatemala – Las Lisas and 
Monterrico. Our goal was to identify the factors that 
influence the balance between sustainable human 
communities and productive marine ecosystems in 
Guatemala. Specifically, considering the on-going global 
changes in climate, and human social and economic 
conditions, the Marine Ecosystem Health and Well-Being 
(MarWeb) project objectives are two-fold: 1) to determine 
how marine ecosystems support human well-being; and  
2) to identify how human communities support sustainable 
and productive marine ecosystems. This is a shift from the 
traditional role where people are exploiters of the ocean to 
one where people are integral components of resource 
sustainability and ecosystem health. This concept, called 
“Sato-umi” in Japanese, recognizes the well-balanced 
availability of various ecosystem services, together with 
effective management of coastal seas. 
 
To address the project goal, on our initial visit in January 
2014, our overarching question for the communities was 
simply, “What is your relationship with the sea?” The 
fishermen and fisherwomen of both villages responded that 
the sea is their life and while fishing is a struggle and 
challenging occupation, they wished to create a balanced 
and sustainable approach to fishing, both for themselves 
and for future generations. Collectively, they accepted 
responsibility for the dwindling fish stocks – and confided 
that they had participated in the overfishing of their 
estuaries and coastal waterways. In one community, the 
fishers felt that they were the “last fisherman” in 
Guatemala. The communal statements were clear and 
honest – and reflected a fear for the future.  These were 
communities motivated to make a change, but felt that 
change would be limited, and were unsure how to proceed.  
These fishers conveyed a strong need for more 
understanding, and a demand for directed action from the 
PICES team of scientists. In other words, they were 
looking for someone to help them take the initiative steps 
to facilitate the needed changes to ensure economic and 
ecological sustainability. 
 
The primary purpose of our second visit in February 2015 
was to perform a Community Needs Assessment (CNA) on 
the communities of Las Lisas and Monterrico with the 
adjacent seas. A CNA is a systematic process for 
determining the ‘needs’ (e.g., economic, nutritional, and 
social) and the definable ‘goals’ of a community.  CNAs 
are performed before major actions are implemented as part 
of a strategic planning process. CNAs can assist in 
directing resources and energies into creating the desired 
future of a community and can be used to address needs, or 
‘gaps’ between current conditions and desired conditions. 
For example, in response to the “last fisherman” statement 
– Did the community want to invest in rebuilding the 
fishing industry or in recreating the community, where 
fishing would be just a part of the mosaic of needed 
changes?  
 
For the CNAs of Las Lisas and Monterrico, we conducted 
both surveys and directed interviews.  We spent a day with 
the community members of each village and surveyed 20 
families (Las Lisas) and 29 families (Monterrico) using a 
‘clicker technology’ response system. The responses from 
family representatives were anonymous but after each 
question, the group response was made known to all the 
respondents.  With follow-up discussions, the diversity of 
answers could be probed further, revealing a deeper 
understanding of the various answers to the initial question.   
 
The questionnaire was comprised of 34 questions, with 
clickable answers.  The questions in general fell into four 
probing areas: 1) questions to introduce the process so that 
the families could familiarize themselves with the clicker 
system and diminish any anxiety associated with the survey 
itself; 2) questions that helped delineate the demographics 
of the responder; 3) questions that probed the demand and 
accessibility of fish/protein supply; and 4) questions that 
examined the willingness of respondents to change their 
relationship with the resources of the sea.  
 
 
The community of Las Lisas wishes to preserve their ocean resources for 
the next generation. 
PICES Press Articles Appendix 5 
228 PICES Scientific Report No. 52 
   
Left:  The fishers of Monterrico; right:  the children of Las Lisas. 
 
From our discussions and answers to the survey, we 
considered the following: 
The fishers view the future as a balance – the next 
generation of fishers must be a smaller group that is better 
educated in sustainable business practices.  The 
communities also need to divert some of their fishing 
efforts to aquaculture activities.  The fishers are already 
aware that a lower fishing intensity is necessary to allow 
the fish stocks to recover, but this is contrasted by the 
intense demand for fish.  Already the canals and inter-
coastal waterways are extremely overfished, and the 
resultant removal of young fish stocks prevents them from 
contributing to coastal fisheries recovery.  Until the fishing 
pressures in the inter-coastal waters are significantly 
reduced, there will be little improvement in the coastal 
fisheries.  The desire for an alternative to traditional 
fisheries – using aquaculture – is steadfast.  However, 
because the Las Lisas community is remote and does not 
have access to a good road system, the pursuit of 
aquaculture for non-local sales will be a challenge.  
Whatever aquaculture is chosen, sustainability is key: these 
efforts must result in a sustainable operation, and must not 
create unsupportive environmental conditions that result in 
reduced ecosystem health.  
 
Recommendations for the communities 
 
During our third visit in February 2016, summaries of the 
CNAs were provided to both communities as an oral 
presentation, a summary booklet with photos and 
comments, and a comprehensive report.  The latter 
included a full synthesis of the survey results, conclusions 
of the CNA and recommendations provided by the PICES 
team. These reports and summaries were given to the 
communities so they could see ‘first hand’ that their 
concerns were represented in the reports, and that they 
could be used to assist community leaders in writing 
proposals for future projects.  Community leaders were 
encouraged to use the report as a tool to help secure 
funding for future eco-friendly development while 
carefully considering which opportunities best promoted 
both community economic and ecosystem health. A 
synthesis of the major recommendations from the report 
include: 
1.  A healthier lifestyle can be facilitated with opportunities 
for better education; sustainable, environmentally-
friendly tourism; and environmentally-considerate 
aquaculture opportunities. 
2.   Protection of the lagoon waters is essential, as these

The way forward 
 
As an integral part of our recommendations to the 
communities, we invited Mr. Max Baldetti, a Guatemala 
citizen and graduate of the Center for the Study of the Sea 
and Aquaculture at the Universidad de San Carlos de 
Guatemala, and the country’s only certified adventure sport 
guide, to provide a series of lectures on sustainable 
tourism.  He spoke about how Guatemala is a ‘mega-
diverse’ country providing diverse opportunities for tourists 
to climb mountains and volcanoes, hike in the jungles, 
paddle on the rivers and mangroves, as well as engage in a 
variety of other potential activities.  He mentioned that, 
“….when you enjoy the coastal environment, you give it 
value.  When it has value, you wish to preserve it and it 
becomes sustainable.”  He spoke about his background in 
tourism and his experiences growing up in both the United 
States and Guatemala, in particular, his increased 
appreciation of the sea in the Monterrico region during in 
his boyhood. He strongly promoted the idea that tourism is 
not just for visitors, but improves life for the whole 
community by bringing in opportunities for education and 
income for community members – women, men, children – 
who all can be involved in tourist activities.  Max stressed 
that that tourism can provide many opportunities for 
women who wish to participate, and that once tourist 
activities are developed and become sustainable, they can 
be shared with children to educate them about their native 
environment.  He mentioned that the potential for 
enhancing tourism needed to be driven by a local desire to 
serve the entire community.  Various efforts have been 
made to start tourist activities in coastal Guatemala, but 
mostly in isolation or by guides from Antigua or 
Guatemala City.  Max suggested that the creation of 
sustainable, targeted tourist activities requiring local 
expertise would provide visitors with a richer, home-
grown, more comprehensive experience.  The result of such 
efforts would be that tourist agencies in the big cities would 
need the services of local guides and would then be 
motivated to promote tours that use local knowledge and 
expertise.  Some examples of tours incorporating local 
knowledge included fishing trips followed by a cooking 
class in a local home, mangrove activities together with 
local arts and crafts, and local bird watching.

In another related part of the project, we have been 
working with the poor coastal community of La Barrona, 
near the Guatemalan border with El Salvador, to develop 
an oyster aquaculture operation that hopefully can be 
transferred to other coastal communities. Crassiostrea 
gigas and C. cortesiensis, have been cultivated in 
Guatemala as part of past research projects, but these 
species have not been used in aquaculture efforts in the 
natural environment.  Through the MarWeb project,  
C. gigas seed was purchased from El Salvador, and the 
oysters were grown for 2–3 months in the shallow waters 
of the Pacific Naval Base San Jose Port Escuintla until they 
were large enough to survive the higher sediment load in 
the waters of the La Barrona estuary. There, the fishery 
cooperative at La Barrona has the legal rights to work in

into maturity.  A 3-year agreement with the Guatemala 
Navy to use a small area of the San Jose port facility for the 
oysters’ initial growth phase will benefit the and will 
strengthen the relationship between the community and the 
Navy.  This collaborative project with the Guatemala Navy, 
oyster aquaculture experts from the Universidad de San 
Carlos, and La Barrona, serves as a model for bringing an 
alternative food source to an impoverished community in a 
developing nation.     
 
This MarWeb project partnership has opened avenues of 
collaboration among the local communities on the coast, 
the military – formerly alienated from academics and the 
public, and the University research community.  Although 
the project duration is only 4 years, we hope that these 
partnerships will continue well into the future.  In 2017, we 
will make a final trip to the communities to facilitate their 
communications with leaders of a United Nations 
Development Program (UNDP) project intended to support 
and expand the five Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) on the 
Pacific coast of Guatemala.  This proposed trip by PICES 
team members is dependent on adequate funding from 
PICES and UNDP. We hope that the knowledge gained 
from these communities will help them strike a balance 
between economic success and preservation of the beauty 
and sustainability of the ocean.

PICES MarWeb project collaborates with the United Nations program on  
the development of Marine Protected Areas in Guatemala 
 
by Vera L. Trainer, William P. Cochlan, Julian Herndon and Charles G. Trick  
 
Background 
 
The PICES/MAFF Marine Ecosystem Health and Well-
Being (MarWeb) project and the United Nations project on 
the “Conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in 
coastal and marine protected areas” supported a multi-day 
workshop for an “Exchange of experiences for 
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in 
protected areas on the marine coast” in which 21 senior 
undergraduate and graduate (licentiate – a step beyond a 
bachelor’s degree, but not quite a master’s degree) students 
participated from the Biology and Aquaculture departments 
from Universidad del Valle (University of the Valley) and 
Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala (University of 
San Carlos), respectively.  These students had diverse 
interests—from phytoplankton to marine mammals, 
anthropology to pollution, fisheries management and 
coastal conservation.  In collaboration with experts from 
the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES), 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA), the Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental 
Studies (RTC) of San Francisco State University and 
Western University in Ontario, Canada, under the 
leadership of the Director of Regulations of Fisheries and 
Aquaculture, Ministry of Agriculture, Ranching, and Food 
(DIPESCA-MAGA), the participants conducted fieldwork
with local fishers to learn about inshore and estuarine 
fishing operations, the management and challenges 
associated with fin-fish and marine products and 
distribution, analysis of case studies on problems with 
fishing gear in the multipurpose Natural Reserve of 
Monterrico, on the Pacific coast of Guatemala, and 
participated in a series of interactive seminar sessions on 
coastal marine issues associated with climate change. 
 
Overview 
 
On February 6-10, 2017, Drs. Vera Trainer, Charles Trick, 
and William Cochlan and Mr. Julian Herndon traveled to 
Monterrico, Guatemala to visit with personnel from 
DIPESCA (Fisheries and Aquaculture Agency), the 
National Forest Institute (INAB), Ministry of Environment 
and Natural Resources (MARN), the Protected Areas 
National Council (CONAP), the Center for Conservation 
Studies (CECON) and the Association for Rescue & 
Conservation of Wildlife (ARCAS).  The primary goal of 
this visit was to share our goals and transfer our knowledge 
obtained from the PICES-supported MarWeb project with 
the investigators leading a new United Nations funded 
project on the establishment of five Marine Protected Areas 
(MPAs) n Pacific coastal Guatemala. The plan for these 
five MPAs is being designed by the lead organizations 
 
The students and instructors of the joint PICES and Director of Regulations of Fisheries and Aquaculture, Ministry of Agriculture, Ranching, and Food 
(DIPESCA-MAGA) training class in Monterrico, Guatemala.

listed above. We followed an agenda that included 
representatives from each of the collaborating agencies, 
followed by student fieldwork and discussion of strategies 
for project success. We discussed in detail the design of 
these MPAs, including how to promote sustainable fishing 
while respecting the needs of families, how best to 
communicate the science to a population with broadly 
variable education levels, and how to sustain MPAs into 
the future.  This training session supported an exchange of 
experiences for conservation and sustainable use of 
biodiversity in protected areas on the coast. 
 
Elements critical to the establishment of successful Marine 
Protected Areas  
 
Overall project findings and recommendations by MarWeb 
investigators were: 
1. Student input. The collaboration of students from the 
University of San Carlos and University of the Valley 
with UN project investigators benefits both the UN 
project and the students.  By keeping the students 
informed of the current issues and challenges (both 
legal and scientific) of the project, they can help 
brainstorm and implement pro-active solutions to 
known and potential problems.  In particular, the 
students were interested in establishing the proper 
balance between enforcement of fishing rules for fishers 
and education of the citizens – both fishers and non-
fishers alike.  This is particularly important because of 
the high rate of illiteracy in coastal Guatemala – 
enforcement without education is unfair, unproductive 
and contributes to social injustice for the impacted 
citizens in a very challenging economic region of 
Guatemala.

2. Empowerment of locals. The students developed 
strategic solutions to a series of fisheries problems in 
coastal Guatemala (e.g., preventing the use of illegal 
fishing nets in estuaries).  The solutions included 
providing outreach to entire family groups, not just 
male fishers.  The inclusion of men, women, and 
children in the decision-making process, allowing them 
to have enthusiasm in the outcome, is important to 
ensure successful recruitment of a wide spectrum of 
community members as coastal stewards. The “stickers 
and clickers” approach (using anonymous surveys 
combined with interesting activities for the children) 
introduced by the MarWeb project will be continued in 
the future by the university faculty and students 
participating in the UN project. 
 
3. Incentives. The sea turtle project is an example of 
successful conservation in coastal Guatemala.  By 
offering an incentive for harvesters to provide 20% of 
the harvested eggs for conservation, there has been a 
substantial rebound in turtle populations.  This incentive 
is also supported by enforcement as there is a fine for 
those who violate the 20% return policy. This strategy 
could be used as a model for other conservation 
programs yet to be established, such as exchanging 
illegal ‘window screen’ type nets for legal ones of a 
defined and ecologically sustainable mesh size.  Those 
adopting legal nets would be presented with a fishing 
license to the fisher of the family upon demonstrating 
an understanding of the fishing regulations while 
emphasizing to the entire family that they have now 
joined the realm of coastal stewards (this was suggested 
by a student group during their discussions).

4. Sustainability. There has been little discussion in country 
about how the MPAs established in Guatemala will be 
maintained after the UN project funding ends.  We have 
suggested that Guatemala should consider developing 
partnerships with international experts of the Natural 
Capital Project and NOAA’s International Marine 
Protected Area Capacity Building Team to develop a 
plan for sustaining the MPAs into the future.  
 
5. Partnerships. It is critical to establish strong partnerships 
with all the environmental agencies playing important 
roles in sustaining coastal resources and protecting the 
Guatemalan coastal, estuarine and nearshore waters.  It is 
essential that all parties responsible for the creation and 
management of the MPAs have an active role in the 
development of these areas, and that they continue to be 
invited and participate in future meetings. 
 
6. Training of the next generation.  The students are 
starved for advanced training in subjects such as stock 
assessment, integrated ecosystem assessment, and 
general oceanography (in particular, chemical and 
biological) and marine biology.  Much of their current 
training is focused on the very practical aspects of 
establishing and maintaining aquaculture operations.  
Future opportunities should be sought to bring in 
international experts to provide training in fisheries, 
ecosystem science, and the challenges facing people 
and coastal organisms due to climate change.  It will be 
important to provide a translator for locals who want to 
listen and learn from the lecturers, but don’t understand 
English fluently.  A rewarding observation was that two 
of the leaders of this workshop had participated in 
previous trainings and workshops sponsored by PICES 
under the Seafood Safety Program as students at the 
University of San Carlos.  Currently, one of them 
oversees Fisheries Resources Regulation, Control and 
Enforcement on both coasts of Guatemala and another 
was the professor for the oceanography class from the 
University of San Carlos.  Both of these individuals 
have put their prior PICES experience to good use in 
Guatemala. 
7. Perceptions of fish and establishment of a supply chain.  
The supply chain for fish transport to Guatemala City  is 
not well developed in that it is difficult to get fresh fish 
to it and other cities in Guatemala.  In part, this is due to 
the lack of education about the nutritional value of fish 
as a valuable source of protein and essential fatty acids 
(e.g., omega-3 fatty acids).  The Guatemalan public has 
the general perception that “fish are smelly, toxic and 
taboo”, which leads to relatively little domestic 
consumption, and export of much of their fish and 
shrimp products to other countries, with the result that 
“Guatemala is exporting health.” The importance of “eat 
at home aquaculture” was stressed as a key to future 
healthy Guatemalan population. 
 
8. Tourism.  The importance of tourism education and 
responsible commercialization of fisheries cannot be 
understated.  There are many examples in Guatemala of 
successful implementation of sustainable tourism efforts 
as an alternative to non-sustainable fishing in 
Guatemala.  For example, the sailfish tourist fishery 
nets $6,000 US per tourist per day, whereas the 
economic value of harvesting and local selling of 
sailfish is two orders of magnitude less profitable as a 
single sailfish sells for only about $75 per fish.  The 
fisheries enforcement groups are attempting to educate 
coastal communities about the importance of sailfish as 
a catch-and-release fishery to sustain this profitable and 
sustainable tourist fishery.  Heavy fines and jail time are 
the consequence of illegal sailfish capture, processing 
(e.g., smoking) and domestic sales, and relatively 
sophisticated and modern methods (e.g., aerial drones) 
are used to find illegal sailfish smoking operations and 
help enforce existing regulations. 
 
In summary, we concluded that it is essential that we listen 
to community members and not tell them what to do, but 
certainly provide guidance where needed.  This helps 
promote the important message that community members 
are the coastal stewards, not experts from outside of the 
country, who must protect the ocean resources for future 
generations.  We witnessed through discussions with 
fishers, community members, project leads and students 
that the fishers and other coastal dwellers are very 
interested in gaining knowledge on ocean changes in order 
to learn and lead as coastal stewards.  It will be important 
to capitalize on their interest and motivation to become 
more responsible guardians of their marine resources, and 
to provide our expert assistance when possible and 
requested. A series of community lectures could help 
bridge the gap between researchers and coastal 
stewards/coastal community members. Moving forward, 
the agencies involved in the UN project should work 
closely together, including working closely with the next 
generation (students) to maximize the impact of their work.  
In particular, those agencies that are responsible for each of 
the five MPAs must work collaboratively, learning from 
the successes and failures in each of the areas.
