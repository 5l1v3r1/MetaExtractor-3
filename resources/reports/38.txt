Executive Summary 
 
 
Based on recommendations of PICES Working Group on Effective Sampling of Micronekton (WG 14), an 
Advisory Panel on Micronekton Sampling Gear Intercalibration Experiment (MIE-AP) was established in 
2002 under the direction of the PICES Biological Oceanography Committee (BIO).  The role of the Advisory 
Panel (renamed as Micronekton Sampling Inter-calibration Experiment in 2004) was to oversee the planning 
and implementation of a field program to evaluate the efficacy of sampling gears and procedures employed by 
different agencies to sample micronekton in the North Pacific, and to disseminate the results to the scientific 
community.  Between 2004 and 2007, three micronekton sampling gear experiments were completed and 
seven gears were inter-compared: 
• MIE-1: October 6–13, 2004, off Oahu Island, Hawaii, U.S.A.; acoustics and three gears [Cobb trawl, 
Isaacs-Kidd Midwater Trawl (IKMT), and Hokkaido University Frame Trawl (HUFT)] were compared; 
• MIE-2: September 25–October 3, 2005, southeast of Hokkaido Island, Japan; acoustics and five gears 
[Midwater otter trawl (OT), Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System 
(MOCNESS-10, MOCNESS-1), FMT (also referred to as HUFT), and Matsuda-Oozeki-Hu Trawl 
(MOHT)] were compared; 
• MIE-3: September 22–23, 2007, eastern Bering Sea; acoustics and two gears (IKMT and MOHT) were 
compared. 
  
Results of the three experiments point out that the Matsuda-Oozeki-Hu Trawl (MOHT) gear was among the 
most reliable and cost-effective micronekton gears examined.  It provided high quality and quantity 
micronekton sampling.  The MOHT is now available commercially and development of a closing/opening 
mechanism for this net is underway.  Equipping the MOHT with an opening/closing mechanism on the cod-
end could put this gear in the position to become a standard micronekton gear worldwide, and in the North 
Pacific, in particular.  As a consequence, the Advisory Panel strongly supports further work in this direction. 
 
Models were developed to predict backscattering volume to allow for comparisons between acoustic and net 
data.  However, preliminary results indicated that the compatibility was low, which points to problems 
associated with both sampling techniques that have been discussed in the literature. The closest results were 
obtained between the MOHT and acoustics.  The Advisory Panel suggests that research in improving acoustics 
estimates should be continued.  In addition, acoustic data collected during all experiments still require some 
degree of editing and analysis.  
 
 A new system, J-QUEST (Sugisaki and Sawada, 2007), was shown to quantify the epipelagic micronekton 
and nekton but appeared to be inefficient in detecting the mesopelagic fishes, and myctophids in particular.  
There is a good potential for adopting this system for mesopelagic sampling but more work is required to 
determine which light spectrum myctophids are less sensitive to.

1 Introduction 
 
Micronekton are structurally defined as relatively 
small but actively swimming organisms falling into a 
size class 2–20 cm, e.g., between the plankton which 
are entirely adrift with the currents and the larger 
nekton which have the ability to migrate without 
much effect from currents (Pearcy, 1981; Brodeur et 
al., 2005). Operationally, micronekton can be 
defined as taxa that avoid being caught with 
conventional plankton nets and are too small to be 
retained by most large trawls.  As a consequence, 
different countries have developed and presently use 
a variety of sampling gears to catch micronekton 
quantitatively. Functionally, micronekton are 
composed of diverse taxonomic groups (Brodeur and 
Yamamura, 2005).  Of particular interest are the 
cephalopods (mainly gonatid and enoploteuthid 
forms, as well as juvenile stages of oceanic species), 
crustaceans (including large euphausiids, pelagic 
decapods, and pelagic mysids), and fishes (mainly 
mesopelagic species such as myctophids, 
gonostomatids and bathylagids).  Most of these 
animals undergo extensive vertical migrations and 
compose the sound scattering layer . Vertical 
migrations are conducted either on a daily or 
seasonal basis, with migrators occupying productive 
surface waters at night and descending to midwater 
during the daytime to reduce predation, or 
undertaking diapause on seasonal scales.  These 
migrations appear to contribute significantly to the 
rapid vertical transport of organic material from 
epipelagic to mesopelagic zones (Kishi et al., 2001).  
The mesopelagic layer, which is arguably among the 
largest and one of the least variable ecosystems in 
the world, plays a critical role in controlling marine 
productivity on global change time scales.  This layer 
is also responsible for the sequestering of 
atmospheric carbon to the ocean floor, thus 
impacting climate and acting as a negative feedback 
to global warming.  Thus it is becoming increasingly 
clear that the mesopelagic realm represents one of 
the most important ecosystem components 
controlling biogeochemical cycling on our planet 
(Tsubota et al., 1999).  Micronekton also include 
small epipelagic ‘forage fishes’, e.g., juvenile forms 
of pelagic and demersal resources, which are 
commonly found in diets of higher level predators 
(Brodeur and Yamanura, 2005). Generally not fished 
commercially because of their relatively small size 
and high lipid content, micronekton therefore 
represent a poorly understood but critical 
intermediate trophic level linking the zooplankton 
and highest trophic levels (including squid, fishes, 
seabirds, sea turtles, and marine mammals) as well as 
surface and midwater layers of the ocean (Seki and 
Polovina, 2001; Brodeur and Yamamura, 2005).  
 
The highly mobile nature (net avoidance) and uneven 
(patchy) distribution of micronekton in the pelagic 
environment and their extrusion through the mesh of 
large trawls make these organisms extremely 
difficult to sample without bias (Pearcy, 1981).  In 
1998, the Biological Oceanography Committee 
(BIO) of the North Pacific Marine Science 
Organization (PICES) established a Working Group 
on Effective Sampling of Micronekton to Estimate 
Ecosystem Carrying Capacity (WG 14) to address 
the concern that there was insufficient information 
on the distribution, biomass and ecology of 
micronektonic organisms in the North Pacific. 
Included in the operational ‘Terms of Reference’ was 
a request to “examine the efficacy of available 
micronekton sampling gears and propose new 
sampling devices if the available ones were not 
adequate for the task”.  One of the recommendations 
included in the WG 14 final report on Micronekton 
of the North Pacific (Brodeur and Yamamura, 2005) 
is that, although a variety of gears are presently being 
used to sample micronekton in the North Pacific and 
other parts of the world ocean (Wiebe and Benfield, 
2003), there has been little effort expended in 
comparing the relative sampling efficiency and 
selectivity of these gears.  
 
It has been more than 20 years since the Scientific 
Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) 
symposium on methods of sampling micronekton 
was convened (Pearcy, 1981).  A substantial effort 
through the International Council for the Exploration 
of the Sea (ICES)/Global Ocean Ecosystem 
Dynamics (GLOBEC) Sea-going Workshop was 
Introduction  Section 1 
2  PICES Scientific Report No. 38 
undertaken in 1993 to compare a large variety of 
plankton nets in the North Atlantic (Wiebe et al., 
2002).  Although three nets suitable for catching 
micronekton were used during the experiment, e.g., 
Isaacs-Kidd Midwater Trawl (IKMT), Multiple 
Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing 
System (MOCNESS) and young fish trawl (YF), 
most of the sampling devices used for comparison 
were designed to sample mesozooplankton, e.g., 
organisms < 2 cm (Wiebe et al., 2002).  Overall, the 
absence of inter-calibration coefficients between 
available gear types has hampered previous efforts to 
make inter-decadal or regional comparisons of 
micronekton composition and biomass. 
 
In 2002, PICES formed an Advisory Panel on 
Micronekton Sampling Gear Inter-calibration 
Experiment (MIE-AP) as a result of 
recommendations from WG 14.  The role of the 
Advisory Panel (renamed as Micronekton Sampling 
Inter-calibration Experiment in 2004) was to oversee 
the planning and implementation of a field program 
to evaluate the efficacy of sampling gears and 
procedures employed by different agencies to sample 
micronekton in the North Pacific, and to disseminate 
the results to the scientific community (see Appendix 
1).  Between 2004 and 2007, three micronekton 
sampling gear experiments were completed: 
• MIE-1: October 6–13, 2004, off Oahu Island, 
Hawaii, U.S.A.; acoustics and three gears [Cobb 
trawl, Isaacs-Kidd Midwater Trawl (IKMT), and 
Hokkaido University Frame Trawl (HUFT)] 
were compared; 
• MIE-2: September 25–October 3, 2005, 
southeast of Hokkaido Island, Japan; acoustics 
and five gears [Midwater otter trawl (OT), 
Multiple Opening/Closing Net and 
Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS-10, 
MOCNESS-1), FMT (also referred to as HUFT), 
Matsuda-Oozeki-Hu Trawl (MOHT)] were 
compared; 
• MIE-3: September 21–22, 2007, eastern Bering 
Sea; acoustics and two gears (IKMT and 
MOHT) were compared.   
 
A list of fish species collected during the MIE-1 
cruise off Ohahu Island is given in Appendix 2.  For 
more details on the working history of the Advisory 
Panel, the reader is referred to MIE-AP Annual 
Reports in Appendix 3.  Appendix 4 contains

2.1.1 Background and Methodology 
 
The first micronekton inter-calibration experiment 
(MIE-1) was successfully completed in October 2004 
off Oahu Island, Hawaii and subsequently discussed 
during the Thirteenth PICES Annual Meeting held 
October 14–24, 2004 in Honolulu (Brodeur et al., 
2005).  This first experiment was intended to serve 
two major purposes: (1) to conduct the MIE 
sampling and obtain information for gear comparison 
as well as to examine a subtropical (oligotrophic 
open ocean gyre) micronekton community; and (2) to 
use the relatively benign weather and sea conditions 
to evaluate and refine protocols, logistics, and 
sampling design for the future experiments. 
Sampling was carried out during October 6–12, 2004 
in the region southwest of Oahu Island over bottom 
depths between 700–1200 m on board the NOAA 
research ship Oscar Elton Sette (Fig. 2.1).  In total, 
56 stations were completed. These included 17 Cobb 
trawl, 19 IKMT and 20 HUFT tows. Nets were 
deployed randomly mainly during the nighttime 
(between 20:00 and 05:00 h local time) and daytime 
(between 08:00 and 17:00 h local time).  Sampling 
usually was not carried out during the crepuscular 
(05:00–08:00 and 17:00–20:00 h) time intervals 
because mictonekton were in flux, e.g., migrating 
between surface and midwater layers (Fig. 2.2). Net 
deployment was dictated by the presence of 
pronounced backscattering layers and average tow

duration was 1 h (Fig. 2.3).  During the nighttime, 
the surface layer was sampled obliquely (Fig. 2.4, 
upper panel).  Usually, nets were deployed to a depth 
of approximately 120 m and slowly brought to the 
surface. During the day, nets were deployed to a 
depth of 550–650 m and towed horizontally 
(Fig. 2.4, lower panel).  In addition, during October 
10–13, 2004 several net deployments at a deep 
scattering layer (DSL), approximately 500–600 m, 
were carried out during the nighttime (Fig. 2.2).

637,829–832,980 m

) for the IKMT, HUFT and 
Cobb trawls, respectively.  Densities were first 
calculated as ind. m
–3
 and then, according to the 
average thickness of the backscattering layers during 
the night and daytime, multiplied by 100 to convert 
densities to ind. m
–2
. 
 
The bycatch between sampling depth and the surface 
layer was considered to be minimal during the 
daytime.  This was confirmed by two oblique tows 
during the day that were aborted for technical 
reasons.  These tows did not reach the midwater 
backscattering layer and did not retrieve any 
macrozooplanktonic and micronektonic organisms. 
 
All samples were sorted immediately after they 
arrived onboard.  Rare and large species were 
counted, measured and weighed from the entire 
Section 2  MIE-1 
PICES Scientific Report No. 38  7 
sample and preserved in 10% formalin seawater 
solution.  The remaining part of the sample was 
either entirely analyzed for macrozooplanktonic and 
micronektonic species (only a few IKMT and HUFT 
samples) or subsampled (all Cobb trawl samples and 
a majority of IKMT and HUFT samples).  Generally, 
½ or ¼ of the sample was used for onboard sorting of 
the catch into major taxonomic groups (fish, 
decapods, euphausiids, tunicates, etc.).  The total 
subsample was weighed and the main taxonomic 
groups were counted.  The remaining part of the 
sample (e.g., ½ or ¾) was preserved immediately 
after subsampling in a 10% formalin seawater 
solution for subsequent laboratory taxonomic 
analyses. In the laboratory, fish, decapods, 
euphausiids and squid were identified, where 
possible, to the species level, counted and measured. 
The remaining zooplankton were only analyzed to 
major taxonomic groups.  Individuals of the main 
taxonomic groups of zooplankton were counted and 
measured to the nearest mm in either the entire 
subsample or ¼ of the subsample.  The taxonomic 
identification of decapod and euphauiid crustaceans, 
as well as oegopsid squid, still requires verification 
and consequently only taxonomic data on fish will be 
presented in the current report. 
 
The inter-comparison between gears was initially 
attempted at the species level but it was soon 
recognized that in this highly diverse tropical 
community such inter-comparison is impractical and 
impossible.  As a consequence, the inter-comparison 
has been attempted for the best represented 
taxonomic groups (fish and crustaceans) and for the 
total catch composition only.  Crustaceans included 
representatives of Copepoda (main size range < 10 
mm), Ostracoda (< 10 mm), Mysidacea (> 20 mm, 
not numerous), Amphipoda (< 20 mm), Stomatopoda 
(< 30 mm, not numerous), Euphausiacea (< 20 mm) 
and Decapoda (> 20 mm).  Length frequency curves, 
which have been used for inter-comparison, were 
constructed for each sampling gear and sampling 
time/depth by averaging organism densities 
expressed as ind. m
–2
 among all samples for the size 
intervals of 1, 5 and 10 mm. 
 
 
2.1.2 Taxonomic Composition of Catches 
 
By a conservative estimate, a total of 208 species of 
macroplankton and micronekton was identified in the 
samples of all three gears.  For a comprehensive list 
of species, see Appendix 2.  Osteichthyes (fish) 
were, by far, the most species diverse group in the 
samples, accounting for 59% of all species verified, 
followed by Oegopsida and Decapoda which 
contributed 16% and 12% of all species provisionally 
identified, respectively.  Among Osteichthyes, the 
midwater family Myctophidae accounted for almost 
60% of all specimens counted.  The second most 
abundant family (ca. 38%) was the Gonostomatidae, 
largely due to the abundant and ubiquitous 
Cyclothone spp. The remaining families contributed 
less than 3% of total fish counts. 
 
Based on the preliminary taxonomic treatment, 
community diversity indices, e.g., evenness and 
species richness, were very similar for the HUFT and 
IKMT, and higher during the nighttime (Fig. 2.5). 
Relatively high evenness indices were a clear 
indication of a numerical predominance of the 
Gonostomatidae and Euphausiacea in the nighttime 
samples.  Both day and nighttime deployments of the 
Cobb trawl caught more species per trawl and as a 
consequence, clearly higher diversity indices 
(Fig. 2.5). 
 
By abundance, four taxonomic groups, 
Euphausiacea, Myctophidae, other fish and 
Decapoda, consistently comprised the majority of 
samples of all three gears, while the contribution of 
all other groups generally never exceeded 4% 
(Fig. 2.6).  Euphausiids were the most prominent 
group in both daytime and nighttime IKMT samples, 
accounting for 42–47% of the total abundance.  
Other fish (16–37%) and myctophids (7–16%) were 
the second and third most abundant groups. Finally, 
decapods contributed 7–12% to total abundance 
(Fig. 2.7).  Unlike the IKMT, in HUFT catches the 
euphausiid contribution was modest (12–14% of total 
abundance).  The samples were overwhelmingly 
dominated by other fish (44–73%, mainly of the 
family Gonostomatidae) followed by myctophids (7–
22%) and decapods (5–14%) (Figs. 2.6 and 2.7). The 
euphausiid contribution to the Cobb trawl catches 
was intermediate compared to the IKMT and HUFT, 
ranging between 17 and 33%. Myctophids (15–57%) 
and other fish (2–35%) again were the second and 
third most abundant groups, followed by decapods 
(7–15%).  Overall, a similar pattern of other fish 
(mainly the families Stomiidae, Serrivomeridae, 
Astronesthydae, and Gonostomatidae), increasing in 
their contribution during the deep daytime tows, was 
found in all gears compared.  This was most 
pronounced in the Cobb trawls when daytime and 
nighttime samples were compared (Figs. 2.6 and 2.7). 
MIE-1  Section 2 
8  PICES Scientific Report No. 38 
The high contribution of other fish in daytime in the 
HUFT and IKMT samples was mainly due to the 
family Gonostomatidae that was missed by Cobb 
trawl catches because of the large mesh size of the 
net.  Comparison of the daytime and nighttime 
midwater tows of Cobb trawls confirms that many 
representatives of the families Stomiidae, 
Serrivomeridae, and Astronesthydae appeared to be 
resident in the deep backscattering layer throughout 
the day.  Finally, the day and nighttime comparisons 
also suggest that myctophids and decapods were two 
strongly migrating taxonomic groups (Fig. 2.6). 
While small sampling gears provided similar catch 
abundances, densities measured using both the 
HUFT and IKMT were generally significantly higher 
than densities obtained by the Cobb trawl for either 
the main taxonomic groups or total macroplankton/ 
micronekton abundance and biomass sampled during 
the MIE-1 (Figs. 2.7 and 2.8).  This was largely 
because these nets had finer mesh sizes than the 
Cobb trawl.

2.1.3 Catch Length Frequency Composition 
 
As reported above, the Cobb trawl total catch 
densities were overall lower than the HUFT and 
IKMT densities.  However, this was also true for 
almost all size classes in the daytime catches and for 
sizes < 30 mm and > 70 mm in the nighttime samples 
(Fig. 2.9).  All gears appeared to be able to sample 
plankton > 1 mm and while the HUFT and IKMT 
provided comparable total catch size distributions, 
the Cobb trawls significantly undersampled size 
classes < 30–40 mm during both day and nighttime 
series.  It should be noted that the closest similarity 
of the total catch densities between all three gears 
compared was only observed in the size range of 40 
to 60 mm. 
 
Similar trends between gears were observed in the 
size frequency distribution of total fish (Fig. 2.10) 
and crustaceans (Fig. 2.11).  Although the slope of 
the total fish curve was similar between the Cobb 
trawl and the IKMT during nighttime, this was 
clearly not the case in the daytime samples 
(Fig. 2.10).  It should be noted that the HUFT 
appeared to sample efficiently for only small-sized 
fish (< 30–40 mm) during both the day and nighttime 
series.  Although the Cobb trawl overall sampled the 
largest fish more readily, the overall size range of 
fish sampled by both the IKMT and Cobb trawls was 
generally comparable (Fig. 2.10).  Similarly to size 
frequency distributions of total catch, both the HUFT 
and IKMT showed comparable distributions of 
crustacean densities with Cobb trawl catches being 
consistently lower through the entire size range 
(Fig. 2.11). The most comparable densities of 
crustaceans in all three gears were, again, observed 
in the size range of 20 to 40 mm.  Overall, however, 
it is important to point out that data for both fish and 
crustaceans appeared to be inadequate for a proper 
inter-comparison between gears (see section 2.1.4).

The Cobb trawl caught substantially larger organisms 
than either of the other two gears due principally to 
its large mouth opening and net mesh size (Brodeur 
et al., 2005).  Overall, the total macroplankton/ 
micronekton size fraction (> 20 mm) in Cobb trawls 
comprised only 1.2–3.9% and 6.8–18.6% of total 
catch abundance in the HUFT/IKMT during the 
night and daytime, respectively.  The Cobb trawl, 
however, was a truly micronektonic sampling gear, 
with organisms > 20 mm constituting, on average, 
58–71% of its total catch throughout the diel period. 
A similar pattern was obvious for total crustaceans 
where crustaceans > 20 mm comprised on average  
< 5% of total abundance in the HUFT and IKMT 
samples and around 40% in Cobb trawl catches.  
Although overall Cobb trawl samples were 
dominated by fish > 20 mm (77–90% of total fish 
counts), only the daytime samples of HUFT and 
IKMT revealed a high average contribution (ca. 
65%) of micronektonic fish, while during the 
nighttime their contribution was modest, ranging 
between 8 and 13% of the total fish catch. 
 
It was observed (even during the preliminary visual 
inspection) that individual gears appear to have 
different sampling efficiencies, often collecting non-
overlapping size groups of plankton and 
micronekton.  This appeared to be relevant for our 
ability to interpret the data acquired from the 
multiple acoustic frequencies.  Therefore, successful 
inter-comparisons between gears would require a 
closer scrutiny of gear types and net mesh sizes prior 
any inter-calibration experiment and the inter-
comparison is perhaps only possible for a particular 
size range of the sample.  Hence, it was decided that 
from now on we will concentrate only on 
macroplankton and micronekton fractions of the 
samples (e.g., on organisms > 20 mm).

2.1.4 Inter-calibration between Three 
Sampling Gears Used during the 
MIE-1 
 
Log-transformed relationships between average 
macroplankton/micronekton (size range > 20 mm) 
densities and the organism length, presented in 
Figure 2.12, had similar slopes for daytime and 
nighttime samples in both the HUFT and IKMT.  In 
both cases, there were fewer organisms in the size 
range 20–50 mm at the surface at night than during 
the day at the deep (ca. 550 m) backscattering layer.  
This is likely an indication of avoidance of small nets 
by micronekton in this size range.  The Cobb trawls, 
however, sampled micronekton well and revealed 
high similarity in micronekton densities at the 550 m 
backscattering layer during both day and nighttime. 
However, it was clear that organisms in the size 
range of 20–50 mm were quite abundant at night in 
surface tows but not in the deep layer, even during 
the daytime.  It is plausible to suggest that their 
downward vertical migration does not reach 550 m 
depth and that they perhaps disperse just above the 
deep backscattering layer.

During the night, all three gears showed similar 
slopes of their density–length relationships, which 
was encouraging news for the between-gear inter-
calibration (Fig. 2.13).  This, however, was not the 
case during the daytime sampling.  While the HUFT 
and IKMT produced very similar results, the Cobb 
trawl undersampled 20–50 mm sized organisms quite 
dramatically due to the reason proposed above. 
 
To quantify the differences in densities of the three 
gears, pair-wise ratios between densities of total 
catch, fish and crustaceans were calculated (Figs. 
2.14–2.16).  For the size classes < 20 mm, the ratios 
of total catch varied widely, sometimes by orders of 
magnitude, between both the HUFT/IKMT and Cobb 
trawl densities but were similar to each other (ratio 
around 1) for the HUFT and IKMT for the size class 
> 5 mm (Fig. 2.14).  A similar pattern was observed 
for both total fish and crustacean densities although 
the nighttime sample ratios were inconsistent (Figs. 
2.15 and 2.16).  The encouraging finding was that in 
the micronekton size classes, the ratios seem to be 
reduced to within one or two orders of magnitude. 
Unfortunately, the ratios were still highly variable at 
1 mm size intervals.

An attempt to reconstruct the biomass of the IKMT 
samples from both the HUFT and Cobb trawl 
densities using average ratios calculated for 1 mm 
intervals revealed reasonably good performance of 
this approach for the size classes > 10 mm and  
> 20 mm in the day and nighttime samples  
(Fig. 2.17). However, overall performance of this 
approach was not encouraging, with calculated 
values either exceeding the true values by 47% or 
underestimating them by 15–41% (see Table 2.1).  
Similarly, poor results were obtained for total 
crustaceans and fish, either overestimating values by 
28–79% or underestimating values by 21–68%. The 
one exception was when the Cobb trawl made a 
reasonable prediction of the daytime IKMT total fish 
densities. 
 
To reduce the high between-gear ratio variability but 
stay within narrow size intervals, preferably with 
uniform ratio ranges, we pooled data into 5 and  
10 mm size bins.  The reconstructed values were 
increasingly more consistent between gears during 
the daytime sampling and less consistent during the 
nighttime sampling (Fig. 2.17).  The deviations from 
a true IKMT value were always negative 
(underestimation) and ranged from –2 to –35% and 
from –11 to –30% for 5 mm and 10 mm size interval 
treatments (Table 2.2).

2.1.5 MIE-1 Macroplankton/Micronekton 
Lessons 
 
• The MIE-1 sampling design appeared to be robust 
for the purpose of inter-comparison between 
various sampling gears and could be applied in 
future experiments.  It was noted, however, that if 
the macronekton and micronekton community is 
diverse, an adequate number of samples needs to 
be collected to yield sufficient data for proper 
statistical analyses of species and taxonomic 
groups. 
• Due to high diversity (too many species, each at 
low individual density), it appeared to be 
impractical to inter-compare macroplankton and 
micronekton densities between different gears at 
the highest taxonomic levels (e.g., species or 
genus).  Nevertheless, it is possible to inter-
compare densities of major taxonomic groups 
sampled by different gears. In the region off 
Hawaii, it was further shown that different size 
groups of the larger taxonomic group could be 
dominated by different taxa.  For example, 
crustacean organisms < 20 mm were represented 
mostly by Euphausiacea and Stomatopoda, while 
specimens > 20 mm were composed largely of 
Decapoda.  This makes the inter-calibration of the 
results between different gears more promising. 
• The macroplankton/micronekton fraction 
accounted for < 20% and > 60% of total  
 
 numbers in the HUFT/IKMT and Cobb trawl 
samples, respectively. Hence, individual sampling 
gears compared during the MIE-1 clearly sampled 
different size groups of plankton covering the size 
range from meso- to mega-plankton.  The Cobb 
trawl, despite its lower catch densities overall, 
appeared to be the best micronektonic gear, 
consistently producing a higher species diversity 
as well as sampling the largest specimens of 
micronekton compared to both the HUFT and 
IKMT.  The latter gears were fairly comparable, 
although the HUFT sampled more 
mesozooplankton and less large fish than the 
IKMT. 
• Using size frequency density data of major 
micronekton taxonomic groups for inter-gear 
calibration appeared to be promising.  The size 
bin method was found to be useful in obtaining 
reliable inter-calibration coefficients between the 
three gears investigated. The ratios between 
plankton densities in compared gears are size 
specific and the 10 mm size bin provided the best 
(within ±30%) density reconstruction runs 
between gears.  It was only reliable for the catch 
size fraction > 20 mm. 
• Although the between-gears ratio coefficients are 
size specific, it remains to be shown that they are 
similar/universal between the same gears in 
different geographical regions and micronekton 
compositions.

2.2 Acoustic Characterization of the Mesopelagic Community off the 
Leeward Coast of Oahu Island, Hawaii 
 
R. Domokos, E.A. Pakhomov, A.V. Suntsov, M.P. Seki and J.J. Polovina  
 
 
2.2.1 Methodology 
 
Active acoustic data were collected on board the 
NOAA research ship Oscar Elton Sette between 
October 6 and 13, 2004, on the leeward coast of the 
island of Oahu, Hawaii (Fig. 2.1).  The R/V Sette is 
equipped with a hull-mounted, dual-frequency, split-
beam Simrad EK60 echosounder system, operating 
at 38 and 120 kHz frequencies.  Both transducers 
have 7° beam angles and were set to operate at pulse 
lengths of 1,024 and 256 ms and transmit powers of 
2.0 and 0.5 kW, respectively.  The lowest signal 
threshold, measured as the mean volume 
backscattering strength, S
v
, was set to –75 dB re 1 m
–1
 
to exclude backscatter from zooplankton and/or other 
smaller organisms.  These settings allowed for a 
depth range of  >1,500 and 220 m for the 38 and 120 
kHz channels, respectively, while maintaining an 
order of 10 signal-to-noise ratio (10 dB re 1 m
–1
). 
 
Data were recorded during all trawl operations (17 
Cobb, 19 IKMT, and 20 HUFT trawls, each 
approximately 5 km in length), as well as during 10 
crepuscular periods (5 during dawn and 5 during 
dusk).  Crepuscular periods were avoided during 
trawls as most micronekton undergo diel vertical 
migration between the shallow scattering layer, SSL, 
and the deep scattering layer, DSL (e.g., Fig. 2.3).  
Data collection for trawl operations started and 
ended approximately 3–4 km before the beginning 
and after the end of the trawls, resulting in 47 
approximately 12-km long “Transects”, not counting 
the 10 Transects recorded during crepuscular 
transition periods.  Before processing the data, each 
echogram was visually inspected to ascertain that 
only high quality data would be used for analysis.  
For the purposes of estimating relative biomass, S
v
 
were integrated over 50-m long by 5-m deep bins for 
each of the Transects (echograms).  For visual 
scrutiny and for integration, Myriax Echoview
®
 
software was used.   The integration of S
v
 resulted in 
mean nautical area scattering coefficients (NASC), in 
units of m
2
 nmi
–2
 (nmi = nautical miles), which were 
then exported from Echoview
®
 for further 
processing.  Data only from the upper 1000 and  
220 m for the 38 and 120 kHz frequencies were 
integrated.  The resulting NASC were used as a 
proxy for biomass estimates, as they are proportional 
to biomass, assuming that the species composition of 
the scattering layers and the resulting scattering 
properties of micronekton do not change 
significantly (MacLennan and Simmonds, 1992).  To 
obtain micronekton density estimates, NASC values 
from each Transect were normalized vertically to a 
unit depth, which was arbitrarily set to 100 m. 
 
As the thresholded sonic scattering layers are 
composed mostly of micronekton undergoing diel 
migration, daytime and nighttime NASC had to be 
analyzed separately.  Thus, both 38 and 120 kHz 
bioacoustic records were divided into daytime and 
nighttime components.  Two 3-h windows, one from 
05:00 to 08:00 h and another from 17:00 to 20:00 h 
were deemed sufficient to remove the effects of all 
crepuscular transition periods.  
 
To compare the acoustic results with those from the 
net trawls, NASC were taken only for the time 
periods of the trawls and from a 30 m vertical 
window centering on the depth of the net, 
continuously monitored and recorded by a Netmind 
acoustic system.  The extent of autocorrelation of the 
data was determined using variograms to obtain 
mean NASC values that are statistically independent 
from each other.  The size of the statistically 
independent units, i.e., Elementary Sampling Units 
(ESUs) were determined to be 30-m by 1-km bins in 
the vertical and horizontal dimensions, respectively. 
To compare biomass and density of the SSL and 
DSL during day and nighttime, or between trawls, 
NASC means from the 38 kHz frequency were 
calculated for each Transect using only one NASC 
value from each ESU.  The NASC means from each 
ESU were then tested to ascertain that the assumed 
MIE-1  Section 2 
20  PICES Scientific Report No. 38 
normal distribution for the 95% statistical 
significance calculations holds.  Since sound 
attenuates faster at higher frequencies, only the  
38 kHz frequency could be used for these 
calculations, as the 120 kHz signals did not penetrate 
to the depth of the DSL.  However, the availability of 
S
v
 at two frequencies in the upper 220 m allowed for 
some primitive scattering layer composition 
estimates of the SSL, as organisms scatter sound 
differently at lower and higher frequencies.  To 
compare the relative composition of the SSL, the 
method of “dB differencing” was used, expressed as 
δS
v
, and defined as 120 kHz S
v
 – 38 kHz S
v
. 
 
 
2.2.2 Acoustic Results 
 
Acoustic data show that the SSL typically extends 
down to an average depth of 200 m (170–230 m), 
while the DSL is located between the depths of 450 
and 750 m, less variable in depth range than the SSL.  
While the DSL is more of a permanent feature, the 
SSL is prominent only during nighttime (Fig. 2.3).  
The DSL consists of two prominent layers, day and 
nighttime, extending from 450–575 m and from 600–
750 m depths.  Both the SSL and the two prominent 
layers of the DSL are composed of several thin 
layers with different acoustic backscatter 
characteristics.  Between the SSL and DSL, at 200–
400 m depths, the water column is devoid of 
organisms except during the dawn and dusk 
transition times (Fig. 2.3).  The scattering layers 
show evidence of relatively high spatial and/or 
temporal variability in their density and composition, 
evidenced by echograms that were recorded within a 
maximum of 0.5 nmi distance and within a 1-h 
window from each other.   
 
Using the 38 kHz data from each Transect, daytime 
DSL was found to have the highest relative biomass 
(mean NASC: 871 ±73 m
2
 nmi
– 2
), followed by 
nighttime SSL (mean: 722 ±67 m
2
 nmi
– 2
), nighttime 
DSL (mean: 608 ±58 m
2
 nmi
–2
), and daytime SSL 
(mean: 119 ±17 m
2
 nmi
–2
), all significantly different 
at the 95% confidence level except the nighttime 
DSL and SSL values (see graphical representation of 
statistical significance in Figure 2.18a, indicated by 
the notches).  However, the relative densities of the 
scattering layers showed a different pattern.  
Nighttime SSL showed the highest densities (mean: 
301 ±21 m
2
 nmi
–2
), followed by daytime DSL (mean: 
290 ±42 m
2
 nmi
–2
), although they were not 
significantly different from each other (Fig. 2.18b).  
Nighttime DSL densities were significantly lower 
with a mean of 203 ±39 m
2
 nmi
–2
 while daytime SSL 
showed the lowest densities  at 50 ±6 m
2
 nmi
–2
. 
 
The δS
v
 of the SSL typically changed from 
approximately 9 dB during daytime to –2 dB during 
nights, with 75% of the data points within the range 
of approximately ±6 dB (Fig. 2.19).  Furthermore, 
nighttime δS
v
 showed differences between regions of 
“shallow” and “deep” topography, defined as bottom 
depths shallower or deeper than approximately 
800 m.  Regions with shallow topography tended to 
show lower δS
v
 values relative to those with deep 
topography. 
 
Topography seems to affect not only the SSL but 
also the DSL.  The DSL was observed to spread 
vertically at slopes of topographical features that are 
shallower than the top vertical extent of the DSL 
(Fig. 2.3).  At topographical regions where the 
bottom topography was about up to 100–150 m 
deeper than the bottom of the DSL, the DSL was 
observed to be thicker and to extend deeper, reaching 
the bottom in those regions (Fig. 2.20).  This feature 
was typically more prominent from about 15:00 to 
06:00 h local time than at other times (Fig. 2.21). 
 
Relative densities calculated for each trawl show 
significant differences from those calculated for each 
Transect (Figs. 2.18c and 2.22).  Trawl region 
nighttime SSL densities were significantly higher 
than those for the DSL both during day and 
nighttime as well as those for the Transect nighttime 
SSL.  The mean trawl regions nighttime SSL was 
518 ±30 m
2
 nmi
–2
, while these values for the daytime 
and nighttime DSL were 269 ±24 and 176 m
2
 nmi
–2
, 
respectively.  Statistical significance of the 
difference between daytime and nighttime trawl-
region DSL could not be confirmed due to the low 
number of trawls conducted in the DSL during the 
night (5 total: 3 Cobb, 1 IKMT and 1 HUFT). 
 
To compare the acoustic micronekton composition 
results to the net trawl samples, δS
v
 values were 
estimated for the nighttime SSL and daytime DSL 
based on the trawl sample results.  From previous dB 
differencing studies, in combination with the 
observed species present in the trawl samples and 
their sizes, the expected δS
v
 values for the organisms 
that were observed in significant numbers were as 
follows: 5 to 15 dB for Euphausiacea, 8 to 15 dB for 
Mysidacea, Decapoda, and Stomatopoda, –5 to –1 
dB for Oegopsida, 5 to 10 dB for Tunicata, and –3 to 
Section 2  MIE-1 
PICES Scientific Report No. 38  21 
0.5 dB for Myctophidae and other fish (Simmonds 
and MacLennan, 2005).  Based on the percent 
composition of organisms in the nighttime SSL and 
daytime DSL in the three different types of nets, we 
would expect δS
v
 values < 0 and > 0 for the 
nighttime SSL and daytime DSL Cobb trawl samples 
(mostly Myctophidae and mostly Euphausiacea for 
nighttime and daytime, respectively) and > 0 and  
   0 for the nighttime SSL and daytime DSL IKMT 
and HUFT samples, with the Hokkaido δS
v
 values 
somewhat lower than those of the IKMT net.  Since 
the acoustic data showed < 0 δS
v
 for nighttime SSL, 
it suggests that the Cobb trawl micronekton 
composition results match those of the acoustics the 
best.  
 
Relative densities of nighttime SSL and daytime 
DSL from only the Cobb trawl samples were 
consistent with those of the scattering layers, 
although there was no statistical significance 
between nighttime SSL and daytime DSL in the 
acoustic data.  Calculating the relative densities for 
the trawls showed more consistency between the 
acoustics and Cobb trawl results for these values, as 
the densities of nighttime SSL become significantly 
higher than those of daytime DSL (Fig. 2.18 b, c).  
On the other hand, relative nighttime DSL densities 
were the highest in the Cobb trawl samples, while 
those values were the lowest calculated from the 
acoustics data, both for each Transect and trawl 
region only, not counting the daytime SSL.  
Calculating the nighttime DSL densities for the trawl 
areas – as opposed to the entire nighttime DSL – 
reduced the nighttime DSL densities, increasing the 
inconsistency with those of the Cobb trawl results.  
Interestingly, relative densities from the IKMT and 
HUFT for nighttime SSL and daytime DSL trawls 
were more consistent with those of acoustic relative 
biomasses, not densities, as both IKMT and HUFT 
results show nighttime SSL densities that are lower 
than those of the daytime DSL.

2.2.3 Main Findings 
 
The results of this study provide some basic 
information on the characteristics of the scattering 
layers off the leeward coast of Oahu, Hawaii.  The 
DSL is more of a permanent feature with densities 
comparable to the nighttime SSL during daytime. 
However, the vertical extent of the SSL is ⅔ of that 
of the DSL (300 m vs. 200 m depth), suggesting that 
the daytime DSL contains significantly higher 
biomasses than those of the nighttime SSL.  On the 
other hand, nighttime SSL densities were 
significantly higher than those of the nighttime DSL, 
although this was not the case for biomass. 
 
The fact that the DSL is more of a permanent feature 
than the SSL indicates that organisms were likely to 
be moving to or from deeper depths than the DSL 
during the dusk and dawn crepuscular periods.  This 
hypothesis is also supported by the observation that 
the DSL, especially after 15:00 h, extended deeper in 
regions with 800–1000 m deep topographies than in 
areas with deeper depths, implying that organisms 
that start migrating down from the DSL at that time 
get trapped by the relatively shallow topography 
(Fig. 2.21).  Differences in δS
v
 at shallow versus 
deep topographies during nighttime could also 
indicate that some organisms with stronger 
backscatter at the higher frequency might be 
migrating to the SSL from depths deeper than the 
DSL during nighttime. 
 
However, differences in daytime and nighttime δS
v
 
in the SSL indicate that most migratory organisms 
scattered more strongly at the 38 kHz frequency than 
at the 120 kHz (Fig. 2.19).  The generally lower 
nighttime δS
v
 values, with a mean of –2 dB, 
indicated that organisms with δS
v
 < 0, such as small 
fish with gas bladders, gelatinous organisms with gas 
inclusions, and possibly squid (e.g., Goss et al., 
1998, 2001; SIMFAMI, 2005; Simmonds and 
MacLennan, 2005) made up the majority of 
migratory organisms.  As opposed to nighttime, 
daytime δS
v
 values with a mean of 9 dB indicate that 
the daytime SSL was composed mostly of 
crustaceans, gelatinous organisms without gas 
inclusions, and possibly fish without gas bladders 
(e.g., Ressler et al., 2004; Simmonds and 
MacLennan, 2005).  
 
While the Cobb trawl samples matched the acoustic 
results the best, there were still inconsistencies 
between the Cobb trawl samples and acoustics 
results.  Differences between nighttime and daytime 
SSL δS
v
 indicate that most of the migratory 
organisms – based on the dominant organisms found 
in the trawl samples – were Mysidacea and possibly 
Oegopsida.  This conclusion is inconsistent with any 
of the 3 trawl sample results, as the percentages of 
Mysidacea and Oegopsida were lower in the daytime 
DSL than in either the nighttime DLS or nighttime 
SSL.  Furthermore, nighttime DSL samples showed 
lower percentages of Euphausiacea than daytime 
DSL, again contradicting the deduction from the 
acoustics results that most fish, and possibly many 
squid, migrated from the DSL to the SSL during the 
nighttime.  These inconsistencies might be due to the 
possible migration of organisms to and from depths 
deeper than the DSL and/or the SSL. 
 
It is interesting to note that the ratio of Myctophidae 
to Euphausiacea increased from the daytime DSL to 
the nighttime SSL consistently for each gear type.  
This increase could indicate that the acoustic relative 
biomass of the daytime DSL might show lower 
values relative to those obtained during nighttime, 
with more (less) Myctophidae (Euphausiacea) in the 
nighttime scattering layer, since Euphausiacea 
(Myctophidae) scatter lower (higher) at the 38 than at 
the 120 kHz frequency.  This could introduce a low 
daytime DSL bias into the acoustic biomass and 
density estimates, with the result that the DSL 
daytime and nighttime values could possibly be 
closer to each other than indicated by the acoustic 
results. 
 
Trawl samples in combination with acoustics can 
help in estimating the composition of scattering 
layers.  While trawl sampling is a useful tool for 
obtaining information on the composition of 
scattering layers, all trawls are inherently biased and 
can be inaccurate, explaining most, if not all, of the 
inconsistencies between the acoustic and net trawl 
results.  As evidenced by this study, the composition 
and biomass obtained by trawl sampling depends on 
the type of net used.  Highly mobile micronekton 
such as fish and squid can easily evade the mouth 
opening of the net, especially nets with relatively 
smaller openings.  Others that have fragile bodies, 
such as salps, disintegrate upon capture in the net, 
resulting in only small pieces of them remaining in 
the samples.  As the trawl results indicate, the 
daytime DSL is dominated by Euphausiacea in all 
three gear types, although increasing from Cobb to 
HUFT to IKMT.  On the other hand, the nighttime 
SSL is dominated by Myctophidae in the Cobb trawl 
Section 2  MIE-1 
PICES Scientific Report No. 38  25 
samples and their percentage decreases from Cobb to 
HUFT to IKMT.  These results clearly indicate that 
the three different gear types sample some types of 
organisms better than others.  It is not surprising that 
the Cobb trawl, with the largest mouth opening of 
approximately 140 m
2
 when fishing, is better at 
catching micronekton while the smaller nets are most 
effective at catching the smaller organisms that tend 
to scatter sound more strongly at higher frequencies. 
 
Inconsistencies between the acoustic and net trawl 
results also arise from the difficulty in reaching 
and/or maintaining trawl target depths with the nets, 
especially while sampling the DSL.  This difficulty 
was encountered even though trawl depths were 
continuously monitored by the Netmind system.  Of 
all the 14 daytime and 5 nighttime DSL trawl 
samples, 6 and 2 missed the DSL entirely, sampling 
either above it (e.g., Fig. 2.23) or below.  Sampling 
of the DSL at inappropriate depths is likely the 
reason for finding more inconsistencies between the 
Transect and trawl region DSL acoustic results than 
between those of the nighttime SSL (Fig. 2.22) and, 
consequently, between the DSL acoustic and trawl 
sample density results than between those from the 
nighttime SSL. 
 
It is important to note that even trawls that sampled 
at accurate depths only sampled a small thin layer of 
the DSL.  As stated earlier, the DSL is composed of 
two prominent layers, each consisting of several 
smaller layers with different acoustic characteristics, 
indicating variability in either composition or density 
of micronekton, or both.  Some micronekton were 
most likely missed entirely by the fact that the nets 
did not sample the thin layers they form within the 
scattering layers.  Others form small, tight 
aggregations that are even more easily missed by the 
nets.  For example, during two consecutive HUFT 
trawls sampling the SSL near dawn, tightly 
aggregated micronekton were observed in the 
echograms at 100–150 m depths, with roughly 8 dB 
δS
v
 values, and were missed entirely by the nets 
(Fig. 2.24).

 values recorded during two HUFT trawls, shown by the purple boxes.  Note that the

As this study indicates, micronekton composition 
and density obtained from trawl data can be highly 
inaccurate as different types of nets preferentially 
sample different types of organisms while less 
efficiently sampling others.  Since the acoustic data 
were targeted at micronekton, the highest 
consistency between acoustic and Cobb trawl data 
indicates that of the three nets used in this study, the 
Cobb trawl sampled micronekton the most 
effectively.  While more efficient and accurate, 
acoustic data cannot be used without trawl samples 
to effectively estimate micronekton composition and 
biomass.  Even though trawl samples cannot be used 
for these estimations, they are very useful for giving  
information on species compositions and their sizes, 
which then can be incorporated into models 
developed by the Species Identification Methods 
From Acoustic Multifrequency Information 
(SIMFAMI) project (SIMFAMI, 2005) for effective 
micronekton composition estimations.  These models 
are based on the different acoustic characteristics of 
various types of micronekton at different frequencies 
and provide more accurate estimates with increasing 
number of frequencies (Lebourges-Dhaussy and 
Ballé-Béganton, 2004).  While the two frequencies 
used in this study are clearly not efficient, using 3 to 
4 or more frequencies, with the combination of Cobb 
trawl samples, would enable effective and reliable 
estimation of micronekton composition and biomass.

2.3.1 Composition and Abundance of 
Ichthyoplankton Collected during 
the MIE-1 
 
Three types of gear used to collect oceanic 
micronekton during the MIE-1 simultaneously 
sampled the diverse tropical ichthyoplankton 
community present in the upper 500 m of the water 
column during both night and daytime tows.  The 
total ichthyoplankton collection is represented by 
5539 larval specimens from 17 orders, 75–78 
families and 140–150 species (Table 2.3).  Although 
the assessment and description of an extremely 
diverse ichthyoplankton assemblage in this area was 
not part of the original field plan, we use this 
complementary data to (1) document kinds and 
abundance of tropical ichthyoplankton in this area 
and (2) compare the performance of different gears 
for ichthyoplankton sampling.  
 
Composition and abundance of ichthyoplankton in 
HUFT samples 
 
Overall, 20 tows performed with the HUFT net 
yielded 2404 fish larvae (43% of total 
ichthyoplankton) from 59–60 families and 105–110 
species. Almost 90% of larval fishes collected with 
this net came from the 13 nighttime tows, which 
showed much higher species diversity compared to 
daytime collections (95–100 vs. 60–65 species). 
Nighttime oblique HUFT tows were dominated by a 
common Hawaiian engraulid, Encrasicholina 
punctifer, which alone accounted for 48.6% of all 
larval specimens.  Other numerically abundant 
species collected at night included Ceratoscopelus 
townsendii (7.5%), Gempylus serpens (3.3%), 
Bolinichthys spp. (2.8%), Vinciguerria nimbaria 
(2.8%), Cubiceps pauciradiatus (2.7%), Cyclothone 
spp. (2.4%) and Lampanyctus sp. (2.1%), with the 
remaining 83 taxonomic categories contributing to 
less than 30% of all larvae (Fig. 2.25).  The 
composition of deep horizontal daytime tows was 
somewhat different largely due to the higher 
numbers of larval hatchetfishes (Sternoptyx sp., 
Argyropelecus sp.) which are known to occur at 
deeper levels and thus were never collected during 
shallow oblique tows at night.  Larval hatchetfishes 
comprised 15.1% of total larval abundance, with the 
majority formed by Sternoptyx spp., and equaling the 
abundance of E. punctifer.  Other numerically 
dominant species included unidentified myctophids 
(9.6%), Diaphus sp. (8.8%), G. serpens (6.0%), 
C. townsendii (4.8%) and Diplophos taenia (2.8%) 
(Fig. 2.25).  The most species-rich family in both 
night and daytime tows of the HUFT was the 
Myctophidae, represented by 14–16 species. 
Barracudina larvae (Fam. Paralepididae) also showed 
somewhat elevated species richness (5 species, 
nighttime tows), but the majority of families were 
represented by 1–2 species. In general, for both night 
and daytime tows, the most numerically abundant 
species were also the most frequently collected. 
 
Composition and abundance of ichthyoplankton in 
IKMT samples 
 
Nineteen tows with the IKMT yielded 2893 fish 
larvae (52% of total ichthyoplankton).  The total 
species diversity was slightly lower compared to the 
HUFT collections, with 95–100 species from 51 
families recorded and with nearly 97% of all 
specimens collected with 12 nighttime oblique tows. 
Similarly to the HUFT net, both night and daytime 
IKMT tows were dominated by E. punctifer, 
comprising 66.7% and 51.7% of all larval specimens 
collected during night and daytime, respectively. 
Other numerically abundant species collected at 
night were Diaphus spp. (3.6%), Bolinichthys spp. 
(2.4%), Cyclothone spp. (2.4%), and V. nimbaria 
(2.1%), with the remaining species contributing less 
than 18% of total larval abundance (Fig. 2.25). 
Although deep daytime tows with the IKMT did not 
collect as many hatchetfish larvae as was observed 
with the HUFT net, larval sternoptychids (Sternoptyx 
sp. and Argyropelecus sp.) still comprised significant 
numbers (6.9%), equaling larval Diaphus sp. 
MIE-1  Section 2 
28  PICES Scientific Report No. 38 
Lanternfish larvae (Fam. Myctophidae) were the 
most diverse in both nighttime (17–18 species) and 
daytime (8 species) collections, followed by larval 
paralepidids (6 species), gempylids (3 species) and 
muraenid leptocephalii (3 species). 
 
Composition and abundance of ichthyoplankton in 
Cobb samples 
 
The very large mesh size of the Cobb trawl is 
generally not appropriate for collecting larval fishes. 
Nevertheless, 241 larval specimens (4.3% of total 
ichthyoplankton) from 28–29 families and 50–55 
species were found in samples obtained with this 
gear. Cobb samples primarily contained large 
postlarvae, with most specimens (91%) collected 
during nighttime.  In addition to the numerically 
abundant E. punctifer (41%), the most frequently 
collected taxa were large bothid postlarvae (Bothus 
sp., Engyprosopon sp., 12.3% of total abundance), 
larval lizardfishes (Fam. Synodontidae, 7.7%) and a 
variety of large leptocephalii (Fam. Muraenidae, 
Ophichthyidae, 7.7%), present in nearly every tow 
(Fig. 2.25).

2.3.2  Comparison of Diversity and 
Abundance between Different  
Net Types 
 
Ichthyoplankton sampling efficiency was significantly 
higher for the IKMT net (77.9 ±38.1 ind. m
–2
) during 
the nighttime compared to the HUFT net (41.3 ±27.7 
ind. m
–2
).  However, during the daytime these two 
gears showed the opposite trend, with the HUFT 
catching more larvae, although numbers were an order 
of magnitude lower for both nets compared to the 
nighttime abundance (Fig. 2.26a).  Nighttime 
sampling with the HUFT and IKMT showed similar 
variations in species richness although the number of 
species collected with each IKMT tow was less 
variable.  However, significantly more species were 
collected with each HUFT net during daytime (16.5 
±8.3 ind. m
–2
), compared to the IKMT (7 ±2.5 ind.   
m
–2
), whereas Cobb samples consistently contained 
fewer species compared to the two smaller nets 
(Fig. 2.26b).  Shannon-Weaver diversity, as well as 
evenness, were significantly higher for the HUFT in 
both night and daytime collections compared to the 
IKMT net (Fig. 2.26c, d). 
 
 
2.3.3 Similarity of Ichthyoplankton 
Assemblages Sampled by  
Different Nets 
 
We assessed the overall similarity of the 
ichthyoplankton assemblages sampled with the three 
different nets using multivariate analyses, including 
hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis and non-
metric multi-dimensional scaling (MDS). The 
resulting groups were examined with a similarity 
percentage (SIMPER) procedure to identify within- 
group sample similarity and the species most 
responsible for group identity. As seen from the 
cluster dendrogram (Fig. 2.27), the compositions of 
both night and daytime Cobb samples (group III) 
were markedly distinct from both the HUFT and 
IKMT nets.  In another large group, composed of all 
HUFT and IKMT samples, most of the samples

collected at night (group I) were quite distinct in 
their composition from daytime deep tows (group II). 
The classification did not show any particular 
distinction between the HUFT and IKMT tows, both 
mixed in their respective clusters (deep and shallow 
tows). SIMPER analysis indicated that Cobb samples 
were dominated by unidentified leptocephalii, 
snapper larvae (Fam. Lutjanidae), larval bothids 
(Engyprosopon sp., Bothus sp.), E. punctifer and 
lizardfish larvae, which accounted for almost 80% of 
the average similarity within this group.  Top taxa in 
the group containing shallow nighttime samples 
taken with the IKMT and HUFT included  
E. punctifer, Diaphus spp., G. serpens, V. nimbaria, 
and unidentified myctophid larvae, which made up 
50% of the total similarity within this group.  The 
group of daytime deep HUFT and IKMT samples 
was mainly characterized by just 5 taxa –  
E. punctifer, Diaphus spp., unidentified myctophids, 
Bolinichthys sp. and Sternoptyx sp., which accounted 
for 92% of the total similarity between the samples 
of this group.  A multi-dimensional scaling plot 
shows similar groups, with the HUFT and IKMT 
samples being distinct from Cobb samples along the 
first, most important ordination axis (Fig. 2.28). 
Nighttime IKMT and HUFT samples show similar 
scores on both axes, and daytime tows for both of 
these nets are primarily separated along the second 
ordination axis.

2.3.4 Summary 
 
• Inter-comparison of the three types of gear used 
in the MIE-1 for collection of ichthyoplankton is 
essentially limited to the HUFT and IKMT 
because the large mesh size of the Cobb trawl is 
not designed to retain fish larvae, and its catches 
were limited to large-sized postlarvae and 
juveniles. 
• Nighttime sampling efficiency of the IKMT was 
significantly higher than that of the HUFT in 
terms of larval abundance, but both nets caught a 
similar number of species. 
• Daytime sampling efficiency of the HUFT was 
significantly higher than that of the IKMT in 
terms of overall larval abundance and species 
richness.  These differences could probably be 
attributed to a lesser stability of the IKMT at 
deeper layers and greater variability in its mouth 
opening when towed at greater depths (as 
opposed to the rigid frame of the HUFT). 
• Shallow oblique tows performed at night and 
deep horizontal daytime tows of the HUFT and 
IKMT sampled somewhat different ichthyo- 
plankton assemblages, described in two types of 
the multivariate analysis.

3 Second Micronekton Inter-calibration Experiment, MIE-2 
 
3.1 Macrozooplankton and Micronekton off Hokkaido Island, Japan:  
Composition and Gear Inter-calibration

3.1.1 Background of the MIE-2 
 
The second micronekton inter-calibration experiment 
(MIE-2) was carried out in the coastal area off 
southeastern Hokkaido Island, Japan, during 
September 23–October 3, 2005.  Comparative tows 
were made at four stations situated over the upper 
continental slope with bottom depths of 
approximately 500 m (Fig. 3.1).  This area is strongly 
influenced by the coastal branch of the Oyashio 
Current (Kono et al., 2004).  The R/V Hokko-Maru 
of the Hokkaido National Fisheries Research 
Institute (HNFRI; Fig. 3.2) was used as the sampling 
platform during the experiment.  The participating 
team included: Orio Yamamura (HNFRI; lead 
scientist), Hiroya Sugisaki (Tohoku National 
Fisheries Research Institute), Kazuhiro Sadayasu 
(Hokkaido University (HU)), Shin-suke Abe (HU) 
and Ryu-ichi Matsukura (HU). Since the cruise 
overlapped with the PICES Fourteenth Annual 
Meeting held September 29–October 9, 2005 in 
Vladivostok, Russia, no scientists from countries 
other than Japan were able to participate in the 
cruise.

addition, the FMT was equipped with nets of two 
different mesh sizes (fine: 3 mm (FMT-F) and 
coarse: 9 mm (FMT-C)).  Specifications and 
photographs of the sampling gears are shown in 
Table 3.1 and Figure 3.3.  The samples collected by 
the MOCNESS-1 were used only for comparison of 
euphausiid catch efficiency.

3.1.2 Sampling 
 
At each of the four stations, every sampling gear was 
towed obliquely to a depth of 300 m, and then the 
nets were retrieved to the surface.  The MOCNESS 
and OT with Multi-sampler sampled down to 400 m 
but only the samples taken in the top 300 m layer 
were used for the inter-comparison.  The nets were 
towed during daytime and nighttime, with the 
exception of the OT, which was towed during 
daytime only.  The sequence of sampling is 
presented in Figure 3.4.  Net depth was monitored 
using SCANMAR net depth sensors attached to each 
net. It was impossible to attach a sensor to the 
MOHT, consequently a SBT data logger (Rigosha 
Co., Tokyo) was used to record the time–depth data 
of the MOHT.  Net depth and wing distance sensors 
(SCANMAR Inc.) were attached to the OT to 
monitor the mouth opening of the net.  At each 
station, the OT was deployed to a depth of 
approximately 400 m, and was then towed obliquely 
to a depth of 300 m with the #1 cod-end opened. 
After that, the OT was towed obliquely to the surface 
with the #2 cod-end opened.  For the inter-
comparison, only the sample collected by the #2 cod-
end was used.  Although it was planned to sample 
with the OT at four stations, it was towed only at 
three stations due to a winch malfunction. 
Furthermore, the sample taken at Station 4 was in too 
poor of a condition to be reliably identified, perhaps 
due to the prolonged sampling time due to the winch 
problems.  Therefore, for inter-comparison only OT 
samples from Stations 1 and 2 were used.  All tows 
were commenced at least 1 h after sunrise or before 
sunset to avoid sampling during twilight conditions. 
Hydrographic observations were carried out in the

entire water column at each station using an SBE-9 
plus Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) sensor 
(Sea-Bird Electronics Inc.).  Backscattering from the 
scattering layers was recorded using an EK60 
echosounder (SIMRAD Inc.) with 38, 70, 120 and 
200 kHz transducers. 
 
3.1.3 Sample and Data Processing  
 
Immediately after the nets were retrieved, 
micronekton, including fish, squids and shrimps, 
were picked out and fixed in a 10% formalin 
seawater solution.  Then, after large jellyfish were 
removed, the total weight of the rest of the sample 
(zooplankton, mainly euphausiids) was weighed to 
the nearest 1 g.  If the remaining sample exceeded 
1 kg in mass, only a subsample of approximately 
500 g was preserved in a 10% formalin seawater 
solution.  In the laboratory, micronekton were 
identified, counted, measured and weighed to the 
nearest 1 mm and 0.1 g, respectively. From each tow, 
up to 150 Diaphus theta were randomly sampled and

Trawl (FMT) was towed only one time each during daytime and nighttime on the second day.  T-3 was cancelled due to a 
winch mulfunction.

measured to the nearest 0.01 mm using an electronic 
caliper.  In addition, up to 100 individuals of 
Euphausia pacifica were randomly sampled from 
each sample, and their total lengths measured to the 
nearest 0.01 mm using an electronic caliper. 
 
Species diversity of the catch of each net was 
assessed using Simpson’s diversity index:

∑
, 
 
where p
i
 is the fraction of the i-th species in the total 
biomass of samples collected by each net.  This 
index ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 representing the 
least diverse community. 
 
 
3.1.4 Catch Composition and Diversity 
 
In total, 26,387 individuals and 26.97 kg of 
micronekton were collected during the MIE-2. 
Myctophid fishes were most important, contributing 
72.9% and 88.5% to the total number and mass 
(hereafter %N and %W), respectively.  Myctophids 
were followed by non-myctophid fishes (12.3%N 
and 4.2%W), crustaceans (decapods and mysids; 
9.9%N and 2.0%W) and cephalopods (4.9%N and 
5.2%W).  Among the myctophids, Diaphus theta 
accounted for 59.6%N and 66.8%W.  
 
Catch compositions by major taxonomic groups are 
shown for different fishing gears in Figure 3.5.  By 
abundance, crustaceans were most important in the 
MOCNESS-10, whereas myctophids highly 
dominated (>90%) both the MOHT and OT catches. 
Myctophids were always more prominent 
gravimetrically with the exception of the 
MOCNESS-10 samples, where they contributed  
< 50% to total catch.  
 
Overall, at least 8 families, 15 genera and 24 species 
of mesopelagic fish were collected during the MIE-2. 
Of these, myctophids, and gonostomatids were the 
most taxonomically diverse groups, represented by 
10 and 6 species, respectively. Micronektonic 
crustaceans included decapods and mysids. While 
the former included 7 species, the latter was 
 
represented by 2 species (Gnatophausia zoea and 
Eucopia sp.).  Cephalopods were the least diverse 
group and were represented only by 5 species.  
 
The Simpson’s diversity indices showed small 
differences between the same sampling gears using 
both abundance and biomass (Fig. 3.6).  One 
exception was the FMT with coarse mesh size (FMT-
C), where D. theta gravimetrically dominated (76%) 
the catches, while accounting for only 38% 
numerically. The samples collected by the 
MOCNESS-10 showed the highest diversity, while 
the MOHT collections had the lowest.

Diaphus theta during the MIE-2, southeast of Hokkaido Island in September–October 2005.  No nighttime sampling was 
made for the otter trawl (OT).  Numbers above the bars indicate ratios to the value of the MOHT; *: P < 0.05 (See Tables 
3.1–3.2 and 3.3–3.4). 
 
 
3.1.5 Sampling Efficiency of Micronekton 
 
Since Diaphus theta dominated the catch both by 
number and weight, sampling efficiencies of gears 
for fish were examined using this species only 
(Fig. 3.7, Table 3.2).  Among the five gears tested, 
the MOHT showed extremely high sampling 
efficiency in terms of both abundance and biomass. 
On average, its efficiency was 6.6–12.2 times higher 
than the other gears by number, and 5.1–23.2 times 
by biomass.  For the calculation, day/nighttime 
differences were not considered since the number of 
tows and the differences by time of day were limited. 
Generally, the higher ratio in the gravimetric 
comparison indicated that the MOHT caught larger 
fish than other nets. MOHT fine mesh net catches 
during nighttime showed statistically significant 
differences (Mann-Whitney’s U-test; P < 0.05) in 
numerical density from the FMT catches. In 
comparison, the MOHT showed statistically 
significant higher values in 3 out of 5 pairs in both 
daytime and nighttime (Table 3.3).  The nets other 
than the MOHT showed rather smaller differences 
between each other (Fig. 3.8) with no significant 
differences in density estimates among the nets 
(Tables 3.3 and 3.4).

The linear relationships between catches of different 
sampling gears (the OT was excluded due to the 
small sample size) are shown in Figures 3.9 and 3.10. 
Using abundance data, three net pairs (MOHT/MOC-
10; FMT-F/MOC-10 and FMT-F/MOHT) showed 
significant correlations (Fig. 3.9).  The poor 
correlations with FMT-C were likely due to the 
absence of this net sampling at Station 1, where 
numerous small-sized (< 25 mm) D. theta were 
caught by the other gears.  Therefore, the linear 
relationships presented in Figure 3.9 would be useful 
for small-sized (< 25 mm) micronekton.  When 
comparing gears using the gravimetric data 
(Fig. 3.10), none of gear pairs showed significant 
correlation, suggesting that no other sampling gear 
was comparable with the MOHT.

3.1.6 Sampling Efficiency of Euphausiids 
 
Sampling efficiency of euphausiids was compared 
between the MOCNESS-1, MOCNESS-10, MOHT 
and FMT-F, with a fine mesh net.  The mesh size in 
the cod-ends of the OT and FMT with their coarse 
meshed net (9 mm) was insufficient to retain 
euphausiids.  The biomass of euphausiids caught at 
four stations by different gears is presented in 
Table 3.5.  Some data are missing due to the loss of a 
cod-end at a sampling station (MOCNESS-1) or loss 
of on-board measurement data of the total amount of 
zooplankton samples (MOCNESS-10 and MOHT). 
The ratio of maximum to minimum density at each 
station ranged from 1.7– 57.3 whereas coefficient of 
variation ranged between 29% and 123%, suggesting 
that estimates vary significantly by sampling gear. 
On average, the MOHT produced 3.9–5.1 times 
higher euphausiid catches compared to the other 
sampling gears.

Density estimates by different sampling gears are 
plotted for comparison in Figure 3.11. The 
MOCNESS-1 showed no clear relationship with any 
other sampling gear.  The MOCNESS-10 showed 
weak positive relationships with the MOHT and 
FMT-F, but these were not statistically significant (P 
= 0.07 and 0.09, respectively).  The comparison of 
the MOHT and the FMT-F showed a strong linear 
relationship (y = 0.28x – 1.98, P < 0.001).  These 
results likely indicate that the estimate by the MOHT 
is most reliable whereas the estimate by the FMT is 
conservative, perhaps due to low filtering efficiency 
of the fine-meshed net.  However, the estimate by the 
latter may be used for inter-comparison between the 
FMT and MOHT.  It should be noted that each gear 
was towed at the highest ship speed possible in this 
experiment (see Table 3.1).  Thus it appears that the 
superiority in catching more organisms by the 
MOHT was partly due to the higher ship speed 
allowed by this gear, which is an additional 
advantage of this net over other gears.  
 
 
3.1.7 Size Distribution of Samples 
 
Following the sampling efficiency inter-comparison, 
comparisons of size distribution were made for 
Diaphus theta, which represented approximately 
60% and 67% of the total number and biomass, 
respectively, of the overall collection. Length 
frequency distributions in different tows were 
combined by weighting with catch number of each 
tow (Fig. 3.12).  Comparison between daytime and 
nighttime was possible only for the MOHT. Two 
distinct modes occurred at 20 mm and 60 mm SL. 
There was no significant difference between daytime 
and nighttime samples (P > 0.05).  The MOCNESS-
10 and FMT-F showed a distinct mode at 18–20 mm 
SL.  Fish larger than 40 mm SL also occurred in 
samples, but their densities were low. The OT and 
FMT caught only > 48 mm SL fish. 
 
The size frequency distribution of Euphausia 
pacifica, the most commonly occurring and 
dominant species among crustaceans at all stations, is 
shown in Figure 3.13. There were no diel differences 
in all samples collected using the MOCNESS-1 and 
MOCNESS-10.  However, samples collected using 
the MOHT and FMT showed significant differences. 
Generally, nighttime collections were represented by 
larger euphausiids (P < 0.001, t-test; Table 3.6). 
Euphausiid body sizes also differed by sampling 
gear.  During nighttime, samples collected using the 
MOHT and FMT showed larger euphausiid body 
length than those taken by the MOCNESS-1 and 
MOCNESS-10. Alternatively, during daytime  
E. pacifica taken by the MOCNESS had significantly 
larger body size than those taken by the MOHT and 
FMT, although the differences in mean TL were 
< 1 mm.  
 
It should be noted that day/nighttime differences in 
euphausiid body length were found in the high-speed 
towing nets, e.g., the MOHT and FMT.  This 
suggests that large E. pacifica may potentially avoid 
such nets even at the highest towing speed, but they 
are likely evasive only when they are able to visually 
sense the nets well in advance.  Furthermore, these 
nets successfully collected many small-sized  
E. pacifica during daytime when compared with the 
 
MIE-2  Section 3 
48  PICES Scientific Report No. 38 
MOCNESS.  It is possible that the MOHT and FMT 
appear to be efficient in sampling near-surface layers 
where small-sized euphausiids concentrate by 
keeping a vertical towing angle to their mouths, due 
to their depressors and the heavy weights at the 
bottom (Bollens et al., 1992).  During the nighttime, 
small-sized E. pacifica were lacking in the size 
frequency distributions. We also have no explanation 
for the skewed size frequency distribution, but one 
possible reason for this may be an increased 
predation pressure from mesopelagic and pelagic 
fishes during the nighttime near the surface.

3.2 Comparison between Acoustic Estimates 
 
H. Yasuma and O. Yamamura 
 
 
3.2.1 Data Collection and Analyses 
 
A Simrad EK-60 echosounder system with 38, 70, 
120, and 200 kHz full-mounted transducers was 
operated at a pulse length of 1.024 ms.  Day and 
nighttime acoustic data were collected along five 
transect lines (Fig. 3.1; see also Fig. 3.17), which 
were set from shelf edge (about 150 m depth) to the 
end of the continental shelf slope (800–1000 depth). 
Data were also recorded during all trawl operations 
and used in comparative analyses with the trawl data. 
 
Raw data of the mean volume backscattering 
strength, S
v
, obtained at 38 and 120 kHz were used 
with the 2-frequency S
v 
method (Miyashita et al., 
1997; Kang et al., 2002).  This method uses the 
difference of S
v
 values ( ΔS
v
) between 38 and 120 
kHz to identify the echo of a given target from raw 
echograms.  We defined ΔS
v 
as ΔS
v
 = S
v
 
at120kHz
 –  
S
v
 
at38kHz
.  The value of ΔS
v
 can be directly 
transformed to the difference of acoustic target 
strength, TS ( ΔS
v
 = ΔTS = TS 
at120kHz
 – TS 
at38kHz
) 
(Kang et al., 2002), and the values of ΔTS of 
Diaphus theta were referenced to models based on 
the swimbladder shape and theoretical TS models 
developed by Yasuma et al. (2008).  We assumed the 
ΔTS range of mature adult fish (> 60 mm in standard 
length) as –4 to 2 dB, and the range of immature fish 
(< 60 mm) as < –4 dB (Yasuma et al., 2008).  In 
addition, the ΔTS range of the other major 
component in the mesopelagic layer, the euphausiid 
Euphausia pacifica, was assumed to be 2 to 16 dB 
(Miyashita et al., 1997). Echoview
®
 Ver. 3.1 
(Myriax) software was used for all echo scrutiny and 
integration. 
 
 
3.2.2 Day and Nighttime Echograms and 
Vertical Fish Density 
 
Typical raw echograms during day and nighttime are 
shown in Figure 3.14.  The higher S
v
 on the sea 
bottom in shallow areas (circles in the figure) were 
assumed to be the echo from walleye pollock, 
Theragra chalcogramma (Miyashita et al., 2004) and 
excluded in the following analyses.  The DSL 
consisted of two prominent layers in daytime 
(Fig. 3.14, left panels).  One was located between the 
depth of 250–300 m and higher levels of S
v
 were 
detected at 38 kHz.  The other was located within the 
depth of 100–200 m and higher levels of S
v
 were 
detected at 120 kHz.  The S
v
 levels in both DSLs 
were relatively low (< –65 dB) at both frequencies. 
At night, these DSLs were difficult to identify 
because both of them moved to the surface layer and 
only a weak scattering extended vertically (Fig. 3.14, 
right panels).  
 
Echos from both size classes of D. theta and  
E. pacifica were extracted using each ΔS
v
 range and 
re-sampled at 120 kHz (Fig. 3.15).  These echograms 
showed that the upper DSL in the raw echogram in 
daytime (Fig. 3.14) consisted of E. pacifica, and the 
lower DSL consisted mostly of immature D. theta, 
which agreed with the results obtained by the 
sampling gears (Fig. 3.11).  The echograms that were 
re-sampled at night revealed the distribution of both 
sizes (or species), which showed that most 
individuals of D. theta were distributed in the surface 
layer (< 100 m), although some immature fishes 
remained within the mesopelagic layer (Fig. 3.15). 
 
Using the above echograms, the vertical distribution 
of fish density was estimated by dividing linear 
values of S
v
 by linear values of fish TS.  The length 
distribution obtained by the MOHT net (Fig. 3.11) 
was applied to the TS–length equation of D. theta at 
120 kHz (TS = 19.5 log L – 73.5) (Yasuma et al., 
2008) and –55.0 and –58.2 dB were estimated for 
adult and immature fish, respectively.  An example 
(line 1) of vertical distribution of fish density (ind. 
m
–3
) between 0 and 400 m averaged every 20 m is 
shown in Figure 3.16.  Values are integrated for 
every 200 m layer and shown on the figure as fish 
ind. m
–2
. The main habitat of both size classes was 
below the depth of 200 m in daytime, but it was 
above the depth of 200 m at night.  Total fish number 
MIE-2  Section 3 
52  PICES Scientific Report No. 38 
(ind. m
–2
) in the upper layer (> 200 m) increased 
about twofold at night (Fig. 3.16) due to the upward 
migration.  These patterns were similar among all 
transect lines. 
 
 
3.2.3 Horizontal Distribution and Biomass 
 
Horizontal distribution and biomass of D. theta were 
estimated separately in the 0–200 m and 200–400 m 
layers, bearing in mind the prominent change of 
day/nighttime fish distribution between the surface 
and mesopelagic layer (Fig. 3.16) which implied 
significant diel changes of biomass in these layers. 
Mean area scattering strength, SA, at 120 kHz was 
obtained at 0.1 nm intervals from re-sampled 
echograms (e.g., Fig. 3.15) for adult and immature 
fish in each layer.  Fish density (ind. m
–2
) in each nm 
was estimated by dividing the linear values of S
A
 by 
the linear values of fish TS (Yasuma et al., 2008). 
Estimated fish density was multiplied by the mean 
wet weight (g) of a fish at the nearest sampling point 
to obtain the distribution of weight density (g m
–2
). 
Total biomass in the survey area and its coefficient 
of variance, C.V., were estimated by cluster analysis. 
Details of these processes can be found in 
Williamson (1982).  
 
The horizontal distribution of biomass (g m
–2
) and 
total biomass of D. theta are shown in Figure 3.17 
and Table 3.7.  Fish were mostly distributed in the 
mesopelagic layer (200–400 m depth) during 
daytime.  Similar levels of density (about 10 g m
–2
) 
extended toward the offshore area, with enhanced 
densities observed near the shelf edge.  At nighttime, 
the majority of fish had moved to the upper layer  
(< 200 m depth) of the water column and fish density 
in this layer reached about an order of magnitude 
greater than that during daytime (Fig. 3.17;  
Table 3.7).  The total estimated biomass of D. theta 
within the MIE-2 survey area (18,800 km
2
) was 
estimated to be 30,443 and 47,447 t during the day 
and nighttime, respectively.

3.2.4 Comparative Results between 
Acoustic and Three Sampling Gears 
 
A simple comparative analysis of fish density 
estimates was carried out between the acoustic and 
MOCNESS-10, MOHT, and FMT gears.  The track 
of each oblique tow was estimated using the data 
from the SCANMAR net depth sensor and/or SBT 
data logger, and the area of acoustic estimation was 
determined so that the oblique track was covered 
(Fig. 3.18).  For the sampling gears, fish density was 
estimated simply by dividing the numerical catch by 
the volume of water filtered.  Both the acoustic and 
gear estimates were standardized to fish number per 
1000 m
3
.  
 
Estimated fish density by MOCNESS and acoustics 
is compared in Table 3.8.  In daytime, the 
MOCNESS did not catch D. theta except in two 
samples at Station 2 and the fish density in all layers 
at other sampling points were estimated to be zero. 
Nevertheless, fish echo signals were detected almost 
continuously during the acoustic observations.  Even 
in the two nets which caught some fish, estimated 
densities were tens or hundreds of times lower than 
that of the acoustic densities.  On the other hand, 
most nets in the MOCNESS caught fish at night, 
although the estimated densities were still lower than 
those obtained using acoustics.  Estimates of fish 
density by the MOHT and acoustics are shown in 
Table 3.9.  Both the day and nighttime samples 
caught by the MOHT included D. theta in all 
samples. The fish densities estimated by the MOHT 
were much higher than those estimated by the 
MOCNESS, and they were relatively close to the 
acoustic estimates, except at Station 4. Estimated fish 
density by the FMT and acoustics is presented in 
Table 3.10. Estimated fish density by the FMT 
showed low values compared to the MOHT (except 
for the daytime samples at Station 1).  It should be 
noted that the differences in fish density estimates 
between FMT and acoustic varied widely among 
sampling points.

3.3 Summary of Results from the MIE-2  
 
• The MOCNESS-10 and FMT with a fine mesh 
(FMT-F) appeared to be inefficient in 
quantitatively sampling the medium to large-
sized micronekton (> 50 mm BL), perhaps 
because of low ship speed during towing 
(MOCNESS-10) and poor filtering capability of 
the netting (FMT); 
• The FMT with coarse mesh (FMT-C) and the OT 
lack the ability to efficiently catch small-sized (< 
25 mm) micronekton due to large mesh size in 
their cod-ends (9 mm);  
• The samples collected by the MOHT appeared to 
represent the most robust density and size 
distribution of micronektonic fishes among all 
gears compared during the MIE-2; 
• The sampling superiority of the MOHT was also 
evident in macroplanktonic crustaceans 
(euphausiids), as it sampled 3.9 to 5.1 times 
more of these compared to the other gears.  It 
appears that the superiority of the MOHT was 
partly due to its ability to work reliably at higher 
towing speed, which is its greatest advantage 
over the other gears.  Nevertheless, the MOHT 
still appeared to underestimate micronekton 
(fish) biomass when compared with the 
estimates using an echosounder with multiple 
frequency transducers, by a factor of 2.2 to 10.8. 
Additional field surveys using the MOHT and 
acoustics to obtain more reliable correcting 
factors are clearly required.

Composition and Gear Inter-calibration

4.1.1 Background and Methodology 
 
During the previous micronekton inter-calibration 
experiments, the following gears were tested: IKMT, 
FMT (= HUFT), Cobb trawl, MOCNESS-1 and 
MOCNESS-10, MOHT and a midwater otter trawl 
(OT) with Multi-sampler), and the superiority of 
MOHT over the other gears was shown.  However, no 
direct comparison has been made between the MOHT 
and the IKMT. The latter gear has been used widely in 
previous (historical) micronekton studies, so the direct 
comparison between these gears is critical in order to 
utilize and standardize archived micronekton data. 
 
The third micronekton inter-calibration experiment 
(MIE-3) was carried out in the eastern Bering Sea  
during September 21–22, 2007. The experiment was 
run during the Ocean Carrying Capacity program 
cruise on board the R/V Oscar Dyson (Fig. 4.1), 
conducted by the Auke Bay Laboratory, NOAA, 
National Marine Fisheries Service of the USA (Dr. 
Jim Murphy, Chief Scientist). Scientists participating 
in the MIE-3 were: Orio Yamamura (Hokkaido 
National Fisheries Research Institute, FRA Japan), 
Hiroki Yasuma (Center for Field Science, Hokkaido 
University) and Andrei Suntsov (Northwest Fisheries 
Science Center, NOAA NMFS).  Initially, a total of 
three days had been allocated during the cruise for 
the MIE-3.  However, due to rough weather 
conditions, this time slot was shortened to only 24 h.  
The sampling gears tested during the MIE-3 included 
a 6-foot Isaacs-Kidd midwater trawl (IKMT; Isaacs 
and Kidd, 1953) and a Matsuda-Oozeki-Hu trawl 
(MOHT; Oozeki et al., 2004).  In addition, 
backscattering from the scattering layers was 
recorded using a Simrad EK-60 echosounder with 
15, 38, 70, 120 and 200 kHz transducers.  Initially, it 
was planned to sample the shelf edge in the eastern 
Bering Sea, targeting micronekton, but the sampling 
position was shifted to a site near St. Paul Island, 
with a bottom depth of 70 m.  This area is well 
known as a nursery ground for age-0 walleye pollock 
(Ciannelli et al., 2004).  
 
Sampling was conducted in both day and nighttime 
during which two gears were towed sequentially with 
triplicate samples collected in each time interval. 
Locations and time of sampling are summarized in 
Table 4.1.  The gear was deployed from the ship and 
lowered to 65 m depth.  The position of the gear was 
monitored by a SCANMAR sensor.  Nets were 
targeted at depths with dense scattering layers (e.g., 
22–23 m and 65–75 m) during the daytime and 
nighttime, respectively.  Once the net arrived to a 
target depth, it was towed horizontally for 15 
minutes during nighttime, and 30 minutes during 
daytime.  The tow duration was extended during 
daytime because the scattering layers representing 
juvenile walleye pollock adhered to the sea bottom as 
time elapsed from sunrise.  The ship speed during 
towing was fixed at 3 kt for both gears following 
discussion at the MIE workshop (W9) on 
“Micronekton sampling gear inter-calibration 
experiment” (Fifteenth PICES Annual Meeting, 
October 13, 2006, Yokohama, Japan; see 
Appendix 3) although the maximum towing speed 
for the MOHT is about 5 kt. 
 
Age-0 walleye pollock collected by both gears were 
measured immediately after every haul, for length 
frequency distribution, whereas euphausiids 
Euphausia pacifica were measured in the laboratory. 
From each tow, up to 200 fish were measured to the 
nearest 1 mm and up to 100 euphausiids were 
measured to the nearest 0.01 mm using an electronic 
caliper.  Data were separated into day and nighttime 
periods combining all tows within time periods.

4.1.2 Sampling Efficiency 
 
A total of 3499 age-0 walleye pollock were collected 
during 12 hauls.  Other species sampled included 
agonids Podothecus asipenserinus (15 individuals), 
capelin Mallotus villosus (6 individuals) and 
Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides (6 
individuals).  Thus, walleye pollock comprised  
> 99% of the total number of fish collected, offering 
a good opportunity for gear inter-comparison.  
The density (i.e., sampling efficiency) of age-0 
walleye pollock estimated by both sampling gears 
differed substantially between day and nighttime. 
Nighttime densities of the MOHT and IKMT were 
24.5- and 10.6-fold higher than values during 
daytime (Fig. 4.2).  This remarkable difference may 
be attributable mainly to the fact that juvenile 
pollock were distributed and perhaps dispersed closer 
to the sea bottom during daytime.  Therefore, the 
difference could be due to lower fish densities rather 
Section 4  MIE-3 
PICES Scientific Report No. 38  61 
than to net avoidance, although the latter cannot be 
entirely excluded (see later discussion).  The inter-
gear difference was less conspicuous, but the MOHT 
during nighttime showed 2.0 to 2.3 times higher 
densities compared to the IKMT catches in terms of 
both abundance and biomass (Figs. 4.2 and 4.3).  It 
should be noted that the ratio between sampling 
efficiencies of the IKMT and MOHT would be even 
larger if the latter gear were towed at higher speed.  
Furthermore, the fact that the biomass ratio was 
higher than the numerical ratio between gears 
indicated that the MOHT sampled larger fish than the 
IKMT (see section 4.1.3).

St. Paul Island, eastern Bering Sea, estimated by different

The zooplankton sampled during the MIE-3 were 
dominated by the euphausiid Euphausia pacifica 
which comprised > 99% of the biomass. Similar to 
juvenile walleye pollock, euphausiid density 
estimates were significantly higher during nighttime 
than daytime (16.1 and 4.9 times for the MOHT and 
IKMT, respectively).  Also, the inter-gear difference 
showed that the MOHT had almost 2-fold higher 
densities of euphausiids than the IKMT (Fig. 4.4).  
 
 
4.1.3 Size Distribution of Samples 
 
Age-0 walleye pollock showed single modal length 
frequency distributions and both gears sampled 
significantly larger fish during nighttime (Fig. 4.5, 
Table 4.2). This suggests that visual avoidance of 
nets by walleye pollock could be a contributing 
factor to the day/nighttime differences in catches (see 
section 4.1.2).  The MOHT sampled fish slightly 
larger in size, but a significant difference was found 
only among daytime samples.  
 
Both gears sampled euphausiids of larger body sizes 
during daytime (Fig. 4.6, Table 4.3).  However, no 
inter-gear difference was found in mean body length 
of euphausiids (Table 4.3).

4.1.4 Comparison with Acoustic Data 
 
Backscattering data were collected throughout the 
MIE-3 experimental sampling, and were processed 
and analyzed using Echoview
®
 software (Myriax 
Software Ltd.).  For the purpose of comparison 
between the density estimates based on acoustics and 
net sampling, each net tow track was depth 
approximated by a strip on the echogram using the 
starting and ending tow-points.  
 
The fish and zooplankton species composition 
collected during the MIE-3 was virtually 
monospecific with walleye pollock and Euphausia 
pacifica accounting for > 99% in terms of both 
number and wet weight. As a consequence, 
backscattering from walleye pollock and E. pacifica 
was easily extracted from the echogram by using the 
S
v
 difference method (Kang et al., 2002) between the 
backscatter of the 38 and 120 kHz transducers.  The 
S
v
 representing both species were converted to fish 
density using the species individual target strengths. 
For walleye pollock, Sadayasu et al. (2006) obtained 
the following regression model by considering 
swimbladder morphology, tilt angle and body length: 
TS = 20 log (FL) – 68.3 (FL < 5cm), TS = 24.6 log 
(FL) – 71.5 (FL < 5cm).  For E. pacifica, the TS 
value from Amakasu (2004) was applied.  In the 
calculation of TS for both species, the average body 
lengths from the nighttime samples of the MOHT, 
e.g., 57 mm FL and 20 mm TL for walleye pollock 
and E. pacifica, respectively, were used.  Numerical 
density was converted to mass by using an average 
body weight.  
 
Overall, estimates by nets and acoustics were far 
more concordant during nighttime.  The estimates for 
walleye pollock by the MOHT and echosounder 
showed consistent values with the average ratio for 
three tows being 1.1, while the IKMT showed a ratio 
of 2.3 (Table 4.4).  The difference in the acoustic/net 
ratio between the MOHT and the IKMT was 
comparable to the difference in density estimated 
from both gears (2.0 times).  These results suggest a 
high degree of accuracy of both the MOHT and 
acoustic estimates during nighttime.  The daytime 
estimates, however, showed significant discrepancies 
between the acoustic estimates and the densities 
obtained using nets.  Daytime net estimates were 
consistently lower than acoustic estimates. 
 
The acoustic/net ratios were more variable for  
E. pacifica than for walleye pollock (Table 4.5).  On 
average, daytime acoustic estimates were 3.1 and 3.5 
times higher compared with those estimated using the 
MOHT and IKMT, respectively.  This result was 
rather confusing because euphausiids are generally 
less evasive from nets compared to walleye pollock, 
thus the density estimate by the nets was expected to 
be more consistent with the acoustic measurements. 
The inconsistency between density estimates by 
acoustics and nets can be attributable to:  
(1) underestimation by the nets, (2) overestimation by 
acoustics, and/or (3) the patchy nature of the 
euphausiid distribution. We cannot draw conclusions 
as to which factors were more important.  However, 
the fact that density estimates of E. pacifica were more 
variable compared to walleye pollock densities (C.V. 
of acoustic estimate during nighttime for walleye 
pollock and E. pacifica; 0.39 and 0.98, respectively) 
suggests that natural patchiness could account for the 
majority of the inconsistency between density 
estimates using acoustics and net sampling.

In conclusion, the comparison between density 
estimates for age-0 walleye pollock (ca. 70 mm FL) 
using the MOHT and acoustics showed a high degree 
of agreement suggesting that the MOHT is the more 
reliable sampling gear for micronekton compared to 
the IKMT. 
 
 
Section 4  MIE-3 
PICES Scientific Report No. 38  65 
 
4.2 Summary of MIE-3 Results
 
• The sampling efficiency of the MOHT and 
IKMT nets for micronekton was compared.  
Both gears showed an extreme day/nighttime 
difference which seemed to be not only 
attributable mainly to diurnal variation in the 
distribution pattern but at least partially to the 
net avoidance of age-0 walleye Pollock, rather 
than the sampling characteristics of the gears; 
• The MOHT showed a 2.0- to 2.3-fold higher 
sampling efficiency in both abundance and 
biomass compared to the IKMT.  This ratio 
could have been even higher if the MOHT had 
been towed at higher speed; 
• Both gears showed significant day/nighttime 
differences in the average size of fish sampled, 
whereas no, or slight, inter-gear differences were 
found; 
• The MOHT showed a 1.8 times higher sampling 
efficiency for euphausiids than the IKMT.  Both 
gears showed a significant day/nighttime 
difference in body size of euphausiids sampled, 
whereas no inter-gear difference was found;  
• Both gears were easy to operate, and showed 
stable behaviors in the water and relatively 
constant catches for both micronekton and 
macroplankton (euphausiids). However, the 
MOHT showed a better ability to sample both 
groups effectively, even at 55% (3 knots) of its 
maximum towing speed (5.5 knots); 
• When density estimates obtained by the 
acoustics and different nets were compared, the 
nighttime MOHT densities appeared to be in 
close concordance (0.9- to 1.1-fold) with the 
acoustic estimates.

5 Overview and Recommendations 
 
 
1. Results of three MIEs point out that the 
Matsuda-Oozeki-Hu Trawl (MOHT) gear was 
among the most reliable and cost effective 
micronekton gears examined.  It provided high 
quality, quantitative micronekton samples.  It is 
now available commercially and development of 
a closing/opening mechanism for this net is 
presently underway.  Equipping the MOHT with 
an opening/closing mechanism on the cod-end 
could put this gear in a position to become the 
standard micronekton gear worldwide, and in the 
North Pacific, in particular.  As a consequence, 
the MIE-AP strongly supports further work in 
this direction. 
 
2. Models were developed to predict backscattering 
volume to allow for comparisons between 
acoustic and net data.  However, preliminary 
results indicated that the compatibility was low, 
which suggests that there are problems 
associated with both sampling techniques, as 
discussed on several occasions.  The closest 
results were obtained between the MOHT and 
acoustics.  The Advisory Panel felt that further 
research in improving acoustic estimates should 
be continued. In addition, acoustic data collected 
during all experiments still require some degree 
of work and clean-up.  
 
3. A new system, J-QUEST (Sugisaki and Sawada, 
2007), was shown to quantify the epipelagic 
micronekton and nekton but appeared to be 
inefficient in detecting the mesopelagic fishes, 
and myctophids in particular.  There is good 
potential for adopting this system for 
mesopelagic work but more work is required to 
determine which light spectrum myctophids are 
less sensitive to. 
 
4. The Advisory Panel, after a brief review of ICES 
and PICES inter-calibration experiments, 
concluded that their inter-comparison is 
generally impossible.  This is due to: first, 
mainly incomparable sampling gears that have 
been used during the ICES and PICES 
experiments, and second, the concentration 
mainly on mesozooplankton in the ICES 
experiment.

2003 Report of the Advisory Panel on Micronekton Sampling Gear  
Intercalibration Experiment 
 
 
Background 
 
While a number of gears are presently being used 
to sample micronekton in the North Pacific and 
other parts of the world’s oceans, there has been 
little effort expended in comparing the relative 
sampling efficiency and selectivity of these gears.  
At the recommendation of PICES WG 14 on 
Effective sampling of micronekton, a new PICES 
field effort to evaluate the efficacy of sampling 
gears and procedures employed by different 
agencies to sample micronekton in the North 
Pacific was launched, and the Advisory Panel on 
Micronekton sampling gear intercalibration 
experiment (MIE-AP) was established at PICES XI 
to oversee the field program.  The first MIE-AP 
meeting/workshop was convened from 09:00 – 
12:15 hours on October 11, 2003, in conjunction 
with PICES XII. 
 
Workshop summary 
 
This workshop was the first gathering of the MIE-
AP members (see MIE-AP Endnotes 1 for 
attendance).  After short introductions of the 
participants, a review of the status of the related 
WG 14 activities (Dr. Richard D. Brodeur), and 
the project background (Dr. Michael P. Seki), the 
discussion turned to the goals, objectives, and 
status of the intercalibration experiment (MIE-AP 
Endnote 2). 
 
The MIE-AP is currently planning to conduct the 
experiment in two phases:  the first cruise in 
Central North Pacific waters off Hawaii just prior 
to PICES XIII in Honolulu, and the second cruise 
in waters of the Bering Sea (or possibly Gulf of 
Alaska) during the summer of 2005.  The Hawaii 
cruise will serve two purposes:  (1) to compare the 
performance of different types of sampling gears 
in an oligotrophic subtropical gyre to see how the 
choice of gear affects our perspective of the 
micronekton community;  and (2) to use the 
relatively benign sea conditions of the subtropics 
to evaluate and refine protocols, logistics, and 
sampling designs.  The northern (Bering Sea) leg 
will sample a much more productive regime and a 
faunal community of great interest to many in the 
PICES member countries.  Upon completion, an 
unprecedented attempt to compare the 
performance of gears within and between the 
contrasting environments will highlight the MIE-
AP effort.   
 
A commitment for a 10-day shiptime aboard the 
NOAA ship Oscar Elton Sette has been acquired in 
the first two weeks of October 2004 to support the 
first leg of the experiment, and a short presentation 
was made on the facilities and capabilities of the 
research vessel for the initial phase of the 
experiment.  For the northern cruise in 2005, 
several scenarios involving other platforms were 
discussed, including:  ships involved with the 
multinational NPAFC’s BASIS project in the 
Bering Sea, Hokkaido University’s R/V Oshoro 
Maru, Japan Fisheries Agency’s R/V Kaiyo Maru, 
and Hokkaido National Fisheries Research 
Institute’s “new” Hokko Maru scheduled for 
operation in 2005.   
 
Micronekton gears currently in use by PICES 
member countries were identified for the 
experiment.  Smaller single warp gear-types 
included the Methot (5 m
2
) net, RMT 8+1, fixed 
frame 4 m
2
 beam trawl, and Isaacs-Kidd midwater 
trawls (IKMT) (1.8 and 3 m varieties).  All of 
these gears can be accommodated on the Sette and 
will be rigged for monitoring depth and 
temperature in real-time during operations. 
 
For “larger” dual warp stern trawls, considered 
were the “Stauffer” modified Cobb trawl and the 
OSU 100 m
2
 rope trawl.  Russian scientists 
generally use large commercial pelagic trawls 
equipped with a small mesh codend liner, but 
shipping such a large net out of Russia may be 
problematic.  It was decided that inquiries will be 
made about the availability of a net with similar 
MIE-AP Annual Reports  Appendix 3 
78  PICES Scientific Report No. 38 
specifications in the United States for possible use.  
Sette’s Netmind mensuration system will be used 
for monitoring the stern trawl nets performances in 
the water.   
 
A number of sampling protocols were addressed.  
Some of the highlights follow: 
   to minimize some of the biases associated with 
diel sampling time, the order of operations 
conducted would be rotated from night to 
night; 
   net mesh sizes would be standardized to  
1 cm for all gears codends; 
   tows will be conducted in a horizontal fashion 
at a depth to be determined in the field; 
   many of the gear are designed to perform 
optimal at specific towing speeds and will be 
deployed accordingly; 
   tow durations will be determined in the field;  
concern was expressed over the effect of tow 
duration on animal damage vs. reduction of 
within tow variability of catch. 
 
Assessment of micronekton resources during the 
surveys will also use acoustic technologies.  
Specifically, MIE-AP members conducting 
acoustic assessments employ the Simrad EK60 
equipped with two frequencies (38 and 120 kHz).  
Other gear-types suggested for consideration 
included visual methods (e.g., video plankton 
recorders or cameras to monitor net extrusion), 
prototype lift nets (e.g., Ocean Friendly design), 
and concurrent neuston nets.  Traditional bongo 
and ring nets while generally macroplankton nets 
were also considered for inclusion in the 
experiment. 
 
An unsuccessful attempt to obtain funding to 
support the experiment was made to the North 
Pacific Research Board (NPRB) at last year’s 
request for proposals (RFP).  A revised proposal 
will again be submitted to the current $3 million 
RFP by December 5, 2003. 
 
Action items were identified for MIE-AP members 
in the weeks to come including the determination 
of the number of participants from each country 
for the cruises (particularly for inclusion in the 
NPRB proposal), consideration of specimen 
disposition and preservation requirements, and 
consideration to sample set replication for ensuring 
statistical analysis. 
 
It was also recommended that a 1-day workshop be 
convened at PICES XIII, immediately after the 
Sette cruise, to review preliminary data and 
findings from the cruise, and discuss the goals, 
objectives, and status of the inter-calibration 
experiment and the future field program.

Background 
 
While a number of gears are presently being used 
to sample micronekton in the North Pacific and 
other parts of the world’s oceans, there has been 
little effort expended in comparing the relative 
sampling efficiency and selectivity of these gears.

This ½-day workshop of the MIE-Advisory Panel 
(MIE-AP) overseeing the field program was 
convened to discuss the goals, objectives, and 
status of the experiment, and begin the formal 
organization and planning process for the 
experiment.  No formal presentations were 
scheduled or made at the workshop, other than a 
short presentation on the facilities and capabilities 
of the research vessel for the initial phase of the 
experiment.

2004 Report of the Advisory Panel on Micronekton Sampling  
Inter-calibration Experiment 
 
 
The meeting/workshop of the Advisory Panel on 
Micronekton sampling inter-calibration 
experiment (MIE-AP) was held from 09:00-15:30 
hours on October 14, 2004, and brought together 
the Advisory Panel members and the participants 
on the first MIE cruise conducted off Hawaii 
(MIE-AP Endnote 1).  After the opening of the 
meeting by Dr. Michael P. Seki, MIE-AP Co-
Chairman, and short introductions by attendees, a 
background overview of MIE-AP and review of 
the project to date ensued.  The discussion then 
focused on the activities, preliminary results, 
lessons learned from the cruise and next steps 
(MIE-AP Endnote 2). 
 
Meeting/workshop summary 
 
The MIE-AP was established at PICES XI (2002) 
to evaluate the efficacy of sampling gears and the 
procedures employed by different investigators to 
sample micronekton in the North Pacific and other 
parts of the world’s oceans (MIE-AP Endnote 3).  
An initial field effort involved an 8-day (October 
6–13, 2004) research cruise in Hawaiian waters 
just prior to PICES XIII, herein referred to as MIE-
I.  This cruise served two purposes:  (1) to 
compare the performances of different types of 
sampling gears in an oligotrophic subtropical gyre 
area to see how the choice of gear affects our 
perspective of the micronekton community;  and 
(2) to use the relatively benign weather and sea 
conditions to evaluate and refine the protocols, 
logistics and design of the sampling.  The 
workshop reviewed preliminary data and findings 
from the cruise, and the MIE-AP meeting that 
followed discussed the goals, objectives and status 
of the future field program. 
 
MIE-I was conducted aboard the NOAA ship 
Oscar Elton Sette in Central North Pacific waters 
off the west side of Oahu Island.  Participants on 
the cruise included:  Michael P. Seki (Chief 
Scientist), Richard D. Brodeur, Daniel Curran, 
Reka Domokos and Donald Hawn (U.S.A.);  
Douglas Yelland, Evgeny Pakhomov and Larissa 
Pakhomova (Canada);  Masayuki Abe and Hiroki 
Yasuma (Japan);  and Andrei Suntsov (Russia).  
 
Three gear-types were employed in the 
comparison:  a dual trawl warp 140 m
2
 Stauffer 
modified Cobb trawl, the single warp 1.8 m Isaacs-
Kidd mid-water trawl, and the single warp 2 m 
variety of Hokkaido University’s Rectangular 
Frame trawl.  During all tows, acoustic backscatter 
was monitored and data recorded with a Simrad 
EK-60 echosounder equipped with 38 kHz and 120 
kHz transducers.  For daytime tows, trawls were 
dropped to the target depth (550 m) and towed 
horizontally for 1 hour (contamination by animals 
in the catch on the ascent and descent to depth was 
assumed to be minimal).  For nighttime tows, 
trawls were dropped to the desired depth as 
defined by acoustic scattering (ca. 120 m), and 
retrieved obliquely through the water column for a 
1-hour duration, and the tow ending with the net at 
the surface.  Since only a fraction of the sound 
scattering layer (SSL) was observed to migrate to 
shallow waters at night, a series of trawls were also 
conducted at depth (ca. 550 m) during the night, to 
acquire information of the non-migrants and 
composition of the SSL with respect to acoustic 
measurements.  The real-time net depths during the 
tows were monitored with a Northstar NETMIND 
net mensuration system. 
 
A variety of topics were addressed during 
discussion, and some of the highlights and 
recommendations follow. 
 
Lessons learned from MIE-I 
   The Panel deemed that it was important to 
note that MIE-I was accomplished without 
financial support; all support for the successful 
execution of the cruise was furnished by the 
participating agencies. 
   The cruise was fortunate to have had 
specialists for each faunal group among the 
participating scientific field party.  When 
MIE-AP Annual Reports  Appendix 3 
82  PICES Scientific Report No. 38 
planning future cruises, having this expertise is 
strongly recommended and needs to be 
considered at the planning stages. 
   The leads for various aspects of the cruise data 
(e.g., biological specimen detailed processing 
– species identification and measurements for 
faunal groups) were identified.  These include 
fishes (Suntsov), crustaceans (Pakhomov), 
cephalopods (Seki), and acoustics (Yelland). 
   Preliminary analysis from MIE-I indicated that 
individual gears sampled different, often non-
overlapping, size groups of plankton and 
micronekton.  It points out that successful 
inter-comparison during future cruises requires 
a closer scrutiny of gear-types and net mesh 
sizes prior the experiment. 
   The Panel agreed that “what one defines as 
micronekton may not be the same definition as 
someone else”.  MIE-I planning encouraged 
participants to bring their micronekton 
sampling gear which resulted in a range of 
mesh sizes and abilities to sample.  On the 
positive side, the ability of the cumulative 
gears to sample the full range from 
mesozooplankton to micronekton enhanced 
the ability to interpret the data acquired from 
the multiple acoustic frequencies. 
   The Panel suggested the adoption of a 
“standard” sampling gear (e.g., RMT 1+8 or a 
3-m IKMT) and mesh sizes to allow and guide 
comparisons for future efforts.  For higher 
acoustic frequencies, a towed transducer to 
access the deeper depths was recommended. 
 
Plans for MIE-II 
   Based on the success and preliminary findings 
of the first cruise, MIE-AP recommended 
conducting a second experiment within the 
subarctic North Pacific using a larger variety 
of micronektonic sampling gears.  This cruise 
is tentatively planned for the summer of 2005 
or 2006, depending on ship time availability, 
in the Bering Sea (or possibly the Gulf of 
Alaska or the western North Pacific).  This leg 
will sample a much more productive regime 
and a faunal community of great interest to 
many in the PICES member countries.  Upon 
completion, an unprecedented attempt should 
be made to compare the performance of gears 
within and between the contrasting 
environments.  This will highlight the MIE-AP 
effort. 
   Dr. Orio Yamamura has requested shiptime 
aboard the Japan Fisheries Agency research 
ship Kaiyo Maru for conducting MIE-II during 
the summer of 2005.  A decision is expected 
by the end of the current calendar year on 
whether the ship time will be awarded. 
   The Panel suggested exploring the possibility 
of joining one of the BASIS cruises to the 
Bering Sea to accommodate the MIE-II 
sampling. 
   The Panel also recommended pursuing 
shiptime aboard the NOAA ships Oscar Dyson 
or Miller Freeman or Hokkaido University 
research vessel Oshoro Maru.  Since most of 
the sailing schedules for these ships are 
already set for 2005, any cruise aboard these 
ships would target the summer of 2006. 
   The Advisory Panel discussed using large 
opening/closing type nets such as the RMT1+8 
and the 4 m
2
 M O C N E S S , o r s o m e o t h e r 
similar gear so that vertically stratified tows 
can be made during MIE-II. 
 
Publications  
   A brief report on MIE-AP activities will be 
published in the next issue of PICES Press 
(January 2005).  
   A data report containing the detailed processed 
results from MIE-I will be prepared and a draft 
completed in time for review at PICES XIV 
(Vladivostok, Russia).  Dr. Seki will take the 
lead in compiling the information from all 
contributors.  The targeted outlet will be the 
PICES Scientific Report Series. 
   Several formal publications will evolve from 
MIE-I, but until the detailed processing is 
completed, a timetable for primary products is 
very difficult to assemble and will be deferred 
until better assessment of processing 
requirements can be accomplished.  This will 
be revisited at PICES XIV. 
 
Proposals 
   Another attempt will be made at obtaining 
financial support for MIE activities from the 
North Pacific Research Board through the 
2004-05 request for proposals process.  Dr. 
Pakhomov will take the lead in preparing the 
proposal package seeking support for  
MIE-II either in the summer of 2005 or 2006, 
depending on platform availability. 
Appendix 3  MIE-AP Annual Reports 
PICES Scientific Report No. 38  83 
MIE-AP membership 
   Dr. Pakhomov to continue as Co-Chairman, 
while Dr. Seki to step down as Co-Chairman 
but remain a MIE-AP member.  The Panel will 
seek a new Co-Chairman who has expertise 
working in the subarctic Pacific and/or Bering 
Sea, the most likely regions to conduct the 
MIE-II cruise. 
   Dr. Yamamura to joint MIE-AP as a member 
and possibly as Co-Chairman to replace Dr. 
Seki. 
   Nomination of additional members to be 
requested from all PICES member countries.

Research Institute representing Japan.  Dr. 
Yamamura has also been appointed to co-chair 
MIE-AP replacing Dr. Michael Seki, who stepped 
down as Co-Chairman but remains as a member of 
the Panel. 
 
Inter-sessional report, March 2005 
 
Dr. Michael Seki summarized the activities and 
plans of MIE-AP in March 2005, prior to the inter-
sessional Science Board/Governing Council 
meeting  After the successful completion of the 
initial MIE-1 in Hawaiian waters just prior to 
PICES XIII, the Panel began plans to conduct the 
experiment (MIE-2) in waters of the Bering Sea 
(possibly in conjunction with a BASIS cruise), 
Gulf of Alaska, or the temperate waters of the 
western Pacific.  A second attempt to obtain 
funding from the North Pacific Research Board 
through the 2004–05 request for proposals was not 
successful.  Nevertheless, Dr. Yamamura offered 
two cruises in 2005 (July 5–11 and September 27-
October 3) aboard the Hokkaido University 
research ship, Hokko Maru, to conduct MIE-2 in 
waters of the western Pacific off Kushiro, Japan.  
The R/V Hokko Maru is a state-of-the art 200' 
stern trawler (905t) equipped with a MOCNESS-
10 (enabling discrete depth sampling) and 
capabilities to deploy other mid-water sampling 
gear including stern trawls equipped with a 
MULTI-SAMPLER (an opening-closing multiple 
codend system).  Transit time to sampling sites 
would be minimal at just 30 minutes after 
departure from Kushiro.  At that time (March 
2005), no firm decisions have been made with 
regard to proceeding with MIE-2.  As for MIE-1, 
processing of samples collected on the cruise 
continues.  
 
Status Report at PICES XIV 
 
Drs. Evgeny Pakhomov and Orio Yamamura 
(MIE-AP Co-Chairmen) provided an update of 
activities and plans for the period from the inter-
sessional report until PICES XIV. 
 
MIE-1 cruise 
 
In 2005, samples collected during the MIE-1 cruise 
in Hawaiian waters have been transported to the 
University of British Columbia, where detailed 
analysis of the sample size-structure has been 
carried out.  Presently, the catch size-structure 
analysis is in its final stage, and  
Dr. Pakhomov is going to present the findings at 
the BIO Committee meeting in Vladivostok. 
 
MIE-2 cruise 
 
Just prior to PICES XIV, the second MIE cruise 
(MIE-2) took place.  The cruise, provisionally 
scheduled for September 27 to October 3, on board 
R/V Hokko Maru was extended by 2 days and was 
conducted between September 25 and October 3, 
2005.  Dr. Yamamura served as the Chief 
Scientist.  The cruise started and ended at Kushiro.  
The experiment was conducted in the Doto area 
where the cold Oyashio current prevails.  This area 
represents a relatively simple and stable species 
composition of micronekton, which makes it fairly 
easy to compare sampling efficiency of different 
gears.  Since the areas where nets have to be 
deployed are just 1–2 h sail from the port of 
Kushiro, it was possible to split the cruise into two 
legs to accommodate those who can participate in 
either the first or second half of the cruise only. 
 
MIE-AP Annual Reports  Appendix 3 
86  PICES Scientific Report No. 38 
The nets deployed in the experiment include 
MOCNESS-10, 10 ft IKMT, HUFT (Hokkaido 
University Frame Trawl), MOHT, and mid-water 
otter trawling net with a mouth opening of ca. 30 × 
30 m and opening/closing multiple codends.  The 
R/V Hokko Maru is equipped with a Simrad EK-
60 echosounder that can monitor and record 
backscattering from micronekton. 
 
MIE-3 cruise 
 
Plans for the 2006 (MIE-3) cruise in the Bering 
Sea are proposed to coincide with the 2006 
NPAFC BASIS program activities in this area.  A 
formal letter has been sent to NPAFC 
representatives to determine if there is any interest 
in doing a joint cruise to the Bering Sea in 2006 
using one of the BASIS project vessels. 
   
The initial response is promising.  Dr. Richard 
Brodeur is planning to meet with NPAFC 
representatives at the joint NPAFC/PICES 
Symposium in November 2005 to discuss the 
MIE-3 cruise proposal.  Attempts will be made to 
obtain financial support for MIE-3 from the North 
Pacific Research Board during 2006.  So far, no 
financial support has been obtained for these 
experiments. 
 
MIE Workshop and Topic Session at PICES XV 
 
As the dates of the MIE-2 cruise overlap, in part, 
with PICES XIV, there will be no MIE workshop 
and business meeting this year.  At the next PICES 
Annual Meeting in Yokohama, MIE-AP would 
like to convene a 1-day BIO Workshop on 
“Synthesis of MIE-AP sampling inter-calibration 
experiments” (MIE-AP Endnote 1) and a 1-day 
BIO Topic Session on “Micronekton biology:  
Advances in epi- and meso-pelagic ecosystem 
research” (MIE-AP Endnote 2). 
 
 
MIE-AP Endnote 1 
Proposal for a 1-day BIO (MIE-AP) Workshop at PICES XV on 
“Synthesis of MIE-AP sampling inter-calibration experiments” 
 
The Advisory Panel on Micronekton sampling 
inter-calibration experiment (MIE-AP) was 
established to evaluate efficiency of a variety of 
sampling gears and procedures employed by 
different investigators to sample micronekton in 
the North Pacific and other parts of the world 
ocean.  Two MIE-AP gear inter-calibration 
experiments were conducted in 2004 (MIE-1 
cruise on board of R/V Oscar Elton Sette, in 
Hawaiian waters) and in 2005 (MIE-2 on board of 
R/V Hokko Maru, in the Oyashio region).  The 
proposed workshop will review and synthesize 
findings from these two successful sampling 
experiments. 
 
Recommended convenors:  Evgeny Pakhomov 
(Canada) and Orio Yamamura (Japan). 
 
 
MIE-AP Endnote 2 
Proposal for a 1-day BIO (MIE-AP) Topic Session at PICES XV on 
“Micronekton biology:  Advances in epi- and meso-pelagic ecosystem research” 
 
Micronekton is an important component of epi- 
and meso-pelagic ecosystems linking meso-
zooplankton and higher trophic levels.  Due to 
their intermediacy and mobility, quantitative 
sampling of micronekton has long been regarded 
as virtually impossible.  Recent advances in 
acoustic devices and efforts in standardizing 
sampling gear have made the sampling of 
micronekton more precise.  In the PICES area, 
various ongoing projects such as BASIS (NPAFC), 
US-GLOBEC and DEEP (Japan FRA) are 
studying micronekton.  The session will synthesize 
new knowledge on micronekton biology including 
distribution, life history and vertical migrations, 
relationships with commercial species and its 
functional role in the North Pacific boundary 
current and open ocean ecosystems.  Presentations 
on quantitative sampling are also welcome. 
 
Recommended convenors:  Evgeny Pakhomov 
(Canada) and Orio Yamamura (Japan).

2006 Report of the Advisory Panel on Micronekton Sampling Gear  
Inter-calibration Experiment 
 
 
The PICES Advisory Panel on Micronekton 
sampling inter-calibration experiment (hereafter 
MIE-AP) was established to evaluate efficacy of 
sampling gears and the procedures employed by 
different investigators to sample micronekton in 
the North Pacific and other parts of the world’s 
oceans. 
 
MIE-AP met on the morning of October 13, 2006.  
After brief introductions of the participants (MIE-
AP Endnote 1), a total 4 presentations were made 
on the results and data processing from the two 
field experiments organized by the Panel in 2004 
and 2005, followed by questions and brief 
discussions on future activities (MIE-AP 
Endnote 2). 
 
MIE-AP workshop (Agenda Items 2 and 3) 
 
The workshop (W9) reviewed data and results 
from the MIE-1 cruise (off the west side of Oahu 
Island, Hawaii, October 6–13, 2004) and the MIE-
2 cruise (in Oyashio waters off Japan, September 
27–October 3, 2005).  Sample processing and 
analysis was discussed, as were other sampling 
gears to be compared, and plans for the MIE-3 
experiment.  The summary of the workshop can be 
found in the Session Summaries chapter of this 
Annual Report. 
 
MIE-AP future activities (Agenda Item 4) 
 
Further data analysis 
 
Although substantial progress has been achieved in 
the analysis of the MIE-1 and MIE-2 data, further 
analyses are required.  In particular: 
   The size-structure approach used by  
Dr. Evgeny Pakhomov for the MIE-1 data 
could be applied to the MIE-2 data sets. 
   An inter-comparison between the MIE-1 and 
MIE-2 data should be attempted. 
   The acoustic data need to be analyzed and 
compared in the light of gear densities.  At first, 
this should be done separately for each cruise. 
 
Other sampling gears to be tested 
 
   The results of the MIE-2 experiment revealed 
that the MOHT gear is among the most 
reliable and cost-effective micronekton gear 
developed to date, providing high quality and 
quantity micronekton samples.  The 
development of a closing/opening mechanism 
could put this gear in the position to become a 
standard micronekton gear in the North Pacific 
and elsewhere in the world. 
   It has been noted that the RMT-8 gear, as well 
as Russian micronekton sampling gear, should 
be included in future experiments to allow 
comparisons. 
   Dr. Hiroya Sugisaki presented some 
preliminary results on the development a novel 
technology (a combination of acoustic and 
high resolution video imaging) to quantify 
deep-sea micronekton.  MIE-AP felt that this 
technology could be beneficial and encouraged 
Dr. Sugisaki to describe the preliminary results 
of trials during the next PICES Annual 
Meeting. 
 
Possibility of the MIE-3 experiment 
 
MIE-AP felt strongly that a third experiment 
(MIE-3) is required to complete the geographical 
coverage, and to include gear types that were 
missed during the first two inter-comparisons.  The 
major problem at the moment is the availability of 
ship time, and in this regard MIE-AP suggests 
pursuing three options: 
   MIE-AP should work towards establishing a 
joint NPAFC-PICES research activity on 
micronekton sampling and conduct MIE-3 in 
the Bering Sea.  Initial and encouraging 
contacts have already been made and will be 
followed in the forthcoming year. 
   Dr. Orio Yamamura will apply for ship time 
(likely for R/V Hokko-Maru) to carry out the 
MIE-3 experiment off Japan. 
MIE-AP Annual Reports  Appendix 3 
88  PICES Scientific Report No. 38 
   The possibility of obtaining ship time for the 
MIE-3 experiment either in the Bering or 
Okhotsk Sea should be negotiated with the 
Russian Delegation. 
 
In the light that the Panel activities will largely be 
concentrated in the northern Pacific seas, MIE-AP 
felt strongly that the membership of the Advisory 
Panel should be increased, particularly from 
Russia and the United States. 
Proposal of workshop/session at PICES XVI 
 
MIE-AP proposed to convene a workshop at 
PICES XVI on “Lessons learned during MIE-1 
and MIE-2:  Reconciling acoustics and trawl data” 
with the objectives of (a) finalizing MIE-1 and 
MIE-2 analyses, (b) presenting and discussing 
acoustic data sets from both cruises, (c) comparing 
ICES and PICES inter-calibration experiments, 
and (d) discussing recent developments in the field 
of micronekton quantitative techniques (MIE-AP 
Endnote 3).  Travel funds from PICES are 
requested for two invited speakers.

Proposal for a ½ or ¾ -day workshop at PICES XVI on  
“Lessons learned during MIE-1 and MIE-2:  Reconciling acoustics and trawl data” 
 
Micronekton is one of the important but largely 
understudied components of marine ecosystems 
functionally linking small zooplankton and higher 
trophic levels.  Recent advances in acoustic 
devices and efforts to standardize sampling gears 
undertaken by both PICES and ICES communities 
have made the sampling of micronekton more 
precise.  Nevertheless, the issue of inter-calibrating 
the growing number of micronektonic gears is still 
unresolved.  The PICES Advisory Panel on 
Micronekton sampling inter-calibration 
experiment (MIE-AP) organized two field 
experiments (off Hawaii in 2004 and off Japan in 
2005) to collect comparative data for several 
micronekton sampling gears and a wealth of 
acoustic information.  The main objective of this 
workshop will be:  (1) to finalize the analysis and 
to compare MIE-1 and MIE-2 data sets;  (2) to 
present and discuss acoustic data sets from both 
cruises;  (3) to compare ICES and PICES inter-
calibration experiments;  and finally (4) to discuss 
new developments in the field of micronekton 
quantitative techniques.

Micronekton sampling gear inter-calibration experiment 
 
Convenors:  Evgeny A. Pakhomov (Canada) and Orio Yamamura (Japan) 
 
Background 
 
The PICES Advisory Panel on Micronekton 
sampling inter-calibration experiment (MIE-AP) 
was established to evaluate efficacy of sampling 
gears and the procedures employed by different 
investigators to sample micronekton in the North 
Pacific and other parts of the world’s oceans.  
MIE-AP carried out their first 8-day cruise from  
October 6–13, 2004, aboard the NOAA ship Oscar 
Elton Sette in Central North Pacific waters off the 
west side of Oahu Island (MIE-1).  The second 
cruise (MIE-2) took place from September 27 to 
October 3, 2005, on board R/V Hokko Maru in 
Oyashio waters off Japan. The workshop reviewed 
data and findings from both cruises. 
 
Summary of presentations 
 
Pakhomov et al. recommended pursuing the use of 
larger size-classes of micronekton (10 mm instead 
of 5 mm) for inter-comparison of gears.  They 
noted that the Cobb trawl mouth area should be 
adjusted according to the mesh size, which really 
catches micronekton.  The use of total mouth area 
can result in underestimating plankton and 
micronekton densities.  It was suggested that 
perhaps acoustic data should be encouraged to 
become an “ideal” universal gear. 
 
Suntsov et al. provided a remarkable overview of 
ichthyoplankton and an inter-comparison of their 
diversity between different gears.  It also appears 
from their research that the Hokkaido net was the 
best gear for the quantitative and qualitative 
sampling of fish larvae.  Two important questions 
were raised in this presentation:  (a) What kind of 
analysis (e.g. community structure analysis) could 
be conducted with the data sets? and (b) Would 
further analysis of the adult population be 
beneficial for the community analysis of larvae? 
 
Yamamura et al. compared six different sampling 
gears during their MIE-2 cruise.  Sample 
composition, to a large extent, was mono-specific, 
which simplified the inter-calibration.  Their 
experiment revealed that the MOHT gear is among 
the most reliable and cost-effective micronekton 
gear developed to date, providing high quality and 
quantity micronekton samples.  The development 
(in progress) of a closing/opening mechanism 
could put this gear in the position to become a 
standard micronekton gear in the North Pacific and 
elsewhere in the world.  It was also found that 
towing speed matters, e.g. MOHT had the fastest 
towing speed, which raises standardization issues. 
 
Yasuma et al. presented very encouraging results 
of developing a technique for an acoustic 
identification of myctophid fishes.  The inter-
comparison between acoustic and gear estimates of 
micronekton was highly recommended as the next 
step.  Concern was raised on how organism 
orientation affects the target strength estimates.  
Authors were strongly encouraged to continue 
their analyses.

PICES Sixteenth Annual Meeting 
October 26–November 5, 2007 
Victoria, Canada 
 
2007 Report of the Advisory Panel on Micronekton Sampling  
Inter-calibration Experiment 
 
 
A subset of the Advisory Panel on Micronekton 
Sampling Inter-calibration Experiment (hereafter 
MIE-AP) and several observers (MIE-AP 
Endnote 1) met on the evening of October 28, 
2007, immediately after the BIO workshop on 
“Lessons learned during MIE-1 and MIE-2:  
Reconciling acoustics and trawl data”.  Details of 
this workshop (W1) can be found in the Session 
Summaries chapter of this Annual Report.  
Discussion topics of the MIE-AP meeting are 
listed in MIE-AP Endnote 2. 
 
Developments in micronekton quantification 
(Agenda Item 1) 
 
Models were developed to predict backscattering 
volume to allow for comparisons between acoustic 
data and the net data.  The new system, J-QUEST, 
was shown to quantify the epipelagic micronekton 
and nekton but appeared to be inefficient in 
detecting the mesopelagic fishes, and myctophids 
in particular.  The discussion revolved around the 
possibility of using a red light or another part of 
the light spectrum to which myctophids are less 
sensitive.  Experimental trials indicated that 
myctophids were able to detect and avoid J-
QUEST while it used red light. 
 
After briefly reviewing current sampling gears, 
present information points to the Matsuda–
Oozeki–Hu Trawl (MOHT) gear as being among 
the most reliable and cost effective micronekton 
gears to date.  It provides high quality and quantity 
micronekton sampling.  Dr. Hiroya Sugisaki 
reported that the development of a closing/opening 
mechanism is underway (trials are to be conducted 
within months).  Equipping MOHT with the 
opening/closing mechanism on the codend could 
put this gear in the position to become a standard 
micronekton gear world-wide, and in the North 
Pacific, in particular. 
 
Comparison between ICES and PICES inter-
calibration experiments (Agenda Item 2) 
 
After a brief review of both ICES and PICES 
micronekton inter-calibration experiments, the 
Panel concluded that it is generally impossible to 
undertake a comparison of these experiments due 
mainly to incomparable gears used for sampling, 
and because the ICES experiment concentrated on 
mesozooplankton in a fjord system in Norway. 
 
Progress on acoustic data analyses (Agenda 
Item 3) 
 
Acoustic data from the MIE-2 cruise (Oyashio 
waters off Japan, September 27–October 3, 2005) 
are mostly analyzed and reconciled with the trawl 
data.  Acoustic data collected during the MIE-1 
cruise (off the west side of Oahu Island, Hawaii, 
October 6–13, 2004) still require some work and 
cleaning.  Data collected during the MIE-3 cruise 
(the eastern Bering Sea, September 18–27, 2007) 
have yet to be released by the U.S. colleagues who 
provided the vessel.  The data will be analyzed 
jointly by Japanese and U.S. scientists. 
 
Compatibility of acoustic and trawl data 
(Agenda Item 4) 
 
Preliminary results indicate that the comparability 
of the trawl and acoustic estimates is low.  This 
points to problems associated with both sampling 
techniques, which have been discussed.  The closest 
results were obtained between MOHT and 
acoustics.  MIE-AP felt that research to improve the 
acoustics estimates should be continued. 
 
Overview of MIE-3 (Agenda Item 5) 
 
The third micronekton inter-calibration experiment 
(MIE-3) was carried out onboard the R/V Oscar 
Dyson in the eastern Bering Sea, from September 
 
MIE-AP Annual Reports  Appendix 3 
92  PICES Scientific Report No. 38 
18–27, 2007.  The ship was engaged in the BASIS 
(Bering-Aleutian Salmon International Surveys) 
program under NPAFC, (North Pacific 
Anadromous Fish Commission) operated by the 
Auke Bay Laboratory, NOAA/NMFS.  Dr. Jim 
Murphy kindly donated the ship time for the 
micronekton experiment.  This experiment was led 
by Dr. Orio Yamamura (Hokkaido National 
Fishery Research Institute, Japan).  Other 
participants included: Drs. Hiroki Yasuma 
(Hokkaido University, Japan) and Andrey Suntsov 
(Northwest Fisheries Science Center, U.S.A.). 
 
The sampling gears planned to be compared were 
the 1.8-m Isaacs–Kid mid-water trawl (IKMT), 
MOHT and Cantrawl 300/262 rope trawl.  
However, due to the limited time available for the 
experiment, only IKMT and MOHT were used.  A 
comparison between IKMT and MOHT was 
essential because there are so much historical data 
collected with an IKMT.  Aside from the sampling 
gears, backscattering data were recorded using a 
Simrad EK-60 echosounder with 15, 38, 70, 120 
and 200 kHz transducers. 
 
Due to rough seas, the ship time assigned for the 
experiment was reduced to 24 hours.  Therefore, 
the nets were deployed at a 60-m depth station 
near St. Paul Island instead of near the shelf break 
of the eastern Bering Sea.  The sampling was in a 
day/night sequential design, with different gears 
towed sequentially at each location, with triplicate 
samples collected during daylight and night at the 
same ship speed (3 knots). 
 
The catch was exclusively dominated by age-0 
walleye pollock (>99%), offering a good 
opportunity for gear comparison.  The nets showed 
similar catchability during daytime (1.1 times 
larger for MOHT in density estimate), but MOHT 
showed significantly higher catchability in night 
sampling (2.8 times higher).  In the comparison of 
body length frequency distribution, MOHT caught 
slightly larger fish than IKMT, suggesting net 
avoidance from the latter net. 
 
The echo sounding data are yet to be released by 
the U.S. colleagues and will be analyzed jointly by 
Japanese and U.S. scientists. 
 
Future activities (Agenda Item 6) 
 
The members of MIE-AP felt that there will be no 
further inter-calibration experiments.  It appears to 
be extremely difficult to obtain ship time, and the 
Panel expressed its gratitude to the member 
countries that donated the ship time to conduct 
three experiments.  The participants also 
concluded that much of the data have been worked 
up at this point, and some encouraging results were 
obtained. 
 
There was unanimous agreement for the 
suggestion that it was time to prepare the final 
MIE-AP report and to write related publications in 
the peer-reviewed literature.  It was suggested that 
some travel funds should be requested to facilitate 
the data analysis.  In particular, the identification 
of fish and crustaceans collected during the MIE-1 
cruise should be completed before writing the final 
report.  In this regard, MIE-AP requested PICES to 
cover travel expenses for Dr. Suntsov to come 
from the Northwest Fisheries Science Center 
(Newport, Oregon) to the University of British 
Columbia (Vancouver) for 7–10 days to assist with 
fish identification.  Furthermore, the MIE-3 cruise 
data need to be worked up. 
 
Realistically, an advanced report on the MIE-AP 
activities could be available at the next PICES 
Annual Meeting in Dalian, China.  Most of the 
work has been divided between groups of experts, 
and MIE-AP Co-Chairmen were charged with the 
task of overseeing the progress.  To facilitate the 
development of the final report, MIE-AP requested 
financial support for one of Co-Chairmen (Dr. 
Evgeny Pakhomov) to travel to Dalian.

Background 
 
Micronekton is one of the important but largely 
understudied components of marine ecosystems 
functionally linking small zooplankton and higher 
trophic levels. Recent advances in acoustic devices 
and efforts to standardize sampling gears 
undertaken by both PICES and ICES communities 
have made the sampling of micronekton more 
precise. Nevertheless, the issue of inter-calibrating 
the growing number of micronektonic gears is still 
unresolved. The PICES Advisory Panel on 
Micronekton Sampling Inter-calibration 
Experiment (MIE-AP) organized two field 
experiments (off Hawaii in 2004 and off Japan in 
2005) to collect comparative data for several 
micronekton sampling gears and a wealth of 
acoustic information. The main objective of this 
workshop was: (1) to finalize the analysis and to 
compare MIE-1 and MIE-2 data sets; (2) to present 
and discuss acoustic data sets from both cruises; 
(3) to compare ICES and PICES inter-calibration 
experiments; and finally (4) to discuss new 
developments in the field of micronekton 
quantitative techniques. 
 
Summary of presentations 
 
Two contributions on the analysis of acoustic data 
described attempts to compare acoustic data with 
the densities of micronekton estimated by trawling 
during MIE-1 and MIE-2 cruises. The main 
conclusion was that the acoustic data represented 
an important technique to quantify micronekton. 
While showing some significant progress, both 
failed to reconcile the acoustic and trawl data. The 
main problems were associated with: 
   additional noise induced by other acoustic 
systems during the MIE-1 experiment;  
   absence of target strength measurements for 
the micronekton species (particularly for  
MIE-1); and  
   undersampling the micronekton due to net 
avoidance or loss of gelatinous zooplankton 
(both MIE-1 and MIE-2).  
J-QUEST technology for observing and 
quantifying micronekton using acoustics and video 
appeared to be very advantageous for resolving 
some outstanding issues between acoustic and 
trawl density assessments, although it still has 
some difficulties in species identification of 
micronekton. MIE-AP concluded that using 
acoustics in a diverse community (e.g. MIE-1) 
requires numerous measurements of the individual 
species target strengths. The absence of such 
measurements translates into large discrepancies 
between acoustic and trawl density estimates.  At 
the same time, when only a few species dominate 
the micronekton community (e.g. MIE-2), it is 
possible to achieve reasonable agreement between 
acoustic and trawl density estimates.  It was 
concluded that a newly developed MOHT net 
appears to be consistently the best sampling gear 
for micronekton and perhaps should be 
recommended as a standard gear for use by PICES 
nations to collect micronekton. 
 
After looking at the intercomparison of gears used 
during the MIE-1 and MIE-2 cruises, MIE-AP 
concluded that when a small number of species (or 
a single species) was dominant in micronekton 
community, the intercalibration between gear types 
appeared to be a relatively straight forward 
exercise. The catchability ratios between gear 
types produced comparable densities. However, in 
a highly diverse community, as it was during  
MIE-1, only the size composition data of large 
taxonomic groups lumped into 10-mm size 
intervals can be compared quantitatively with any 
success. This approach allowed the calculation of 
intercalibration coefficients between three gear 
types used during MIE-1 and yielded relatively 
accurate (within 12–30%) intercomparison of 
micronekton densities obtained by different gears.

2008 Report of the Advisory Panel on Micronekton Sampling  
Inter-calibration Experiment 
 
 
At the 2007 Annual Meeting, the Advisory Panel 
on the Micronekton Sampling Inter-calibration 
Experiment (MIE-AP) prepared to submit a draft 
of the final report at the time of 2008 Annual 
Meeting. However, the necessity of conducting 
additional sample analyses from the MIE-1 and 
MIE-2/3 cruises caused a delay in the preparation 
of the draft report.  Consequently, the Advisory 
Panel decided to postpone the draft submission 
until PICES-2009. A brief description of the 
analyses, presently ongoing, follows. 
 
MIE-1 
 
Scientists participating in MIE-1 have finished 
identification of all fish and squid specimens 
collected during the cruise, but they still have 
some crustacean samples to identify. Although 
about half samples have already been analyzed, 
currently the complete size- frequency analyses of 
all crustaceans and other plankton from remaining 
samples are underway. The addition of more 
samples will provide higher statistical power in the 
comparative analysis by reducing the deviation of 
data. 
 
To date, three papers directly from the results of 
the cruise are at different stages of preparation 
(sampling gear comparison, comparison between 
nets vs. acoustics, and fish larvae).  
MIE-2 and 3 
 
Comparison of sampling efficiency for dominant 
fish species has been finished for both of the 
cruises. But that for euphausiids, including size-
frequency distribution, is underway. Scientists at 
Hokkaido University analyzed acoustic data 
obtained during the MIE 2/3 cruises, including 
density estimate and geostastical analyses of 
fish/euphausiids. Publication of two papers are 
anticipated from the gear comparison (one for 
comparison of sampling efficiency of fish by 
different fishing gears; another for euphausiids), 
and one paper from the net/acoustic comparison. 
Scientists at Hokkaido University analyzed 
acoustic data obtained during the MIE 2/3 cruises, 
including density estimate and geostastical 
analyses of fish/euphausiids.  
 
Apart from these analyses, Japanese scientists 
made a cruise to test J-QUEST, an integrated 
system to visualize and quantify micronekton, in 
August 2008. A topical issue for this year is a new 
lighting apparatus which is invisible to fish and 
therefore does not affect fish behavior. The 
development of J-QUEST will be summarized in 
the final report.

Micronekton - What are they and why are they important?

Background 
 
Micronekton are relatively small but actively swimming 
organisms ranging in size between plankton (< 2 cm), 
which drift with the currents, and larger nekton (> 10 cm), 
which have the ability to swim freely without being overly 
affected by currents.  Although there are some precise 
definitions based on Reynolds numbers, micronekton may 
be operationally defined as taxa too vagile to be caught 
with conventional plankton nets and too small to be 
retained by most large-meshed trawls.  Micronekton are 
diverse taxonomically.  The principal groups include the 
cephalopods (small species and juvenile stages of large 
oceanic species), crustaceans (including adult euphausiids, 
pelagic decapods and mysids), and fishes (mainly 
mesopelagic species and juveniles of pelagic nekton).  
Although not generally fished commercially because of 
their relatively small size and high lipid content, 
mesopelagic fishes represent a substantial biomass in 
oceanic waters and are a critical but poorly understood 
intermediate trophic link between the mesozooplankton and 
the higher trophic levels including fishes, seabirds and 
marine mammals.  Many studies have shown that 
micronektonic species are a primary food source for a wide 
variety of harvested nektonic species. 
 
 
Fig. 1 Diversity of life forms considered as micronekton. 
 
Many micronektonic species can be found close to shore or 
near the sea surface (e.g., Abookire et al., 2002, Fish. Bull. 
U.S., 100:  376-380), but most occur in the midwater 
pelagic realm mainly at the edge of, or beyond the 
continental shelves.  Indeed, micronekton are one of the 
most conspicuous and ecologically-important components 
of the vast mesopelagic zone of the world’s oceans, 
arguably the largest and one of the least variable 
ecosystems on the planet.  This dark, cold, and relatively 
unproductive system extends from around 200 m to depths 
greater than 1000 m, and many of these organisms have 
evolved unique adaptations to this environment (Fig.1).  
Most mesopelagic micronektonic organisms undertake 
extensive vertical migrations on a daily basis, occupying 
the productive surface waters at night and descending to 
midwater during the daytime to reduce predation.  Diel 
vertical migration of micronekton has been shown to 
contribute significantly to the rapid vertical transport of 
organic material from epipelagic to mesopelagic zones, 
referred to as the biological pump, where carbon fixed as 
living organic matter plus anthropogenic substances, such 
as insecticides and pollutants, are transported to deep-sea 
ecosystems.  These micronektonic organisms in turn may 
be consumed by epipelagic predators in the near-surface 
waters, large nekton such as tunas, sharks and swordfishes 
that migrate dielly with the micronekton, and deep-sea 
fishes that migrate up to midwater.  All of these predators 
capitalize on this vast and highly predictable food source. 
 
Despite their importance to many consumers in the ocean, 
relatively scant attention has been paid to micronekton as a 
whole, especially compared to the primary consumer and 
top trophic levels that they link.  Much of what is known 
and published in the literature was generated in the 1960s 
and 1970s and was not synthesized in any manner.  A need 
was identified within the PICES community, especially 
among the ecosystem modelers, for a summary of the 
available information on micronekton in the North Pacific.  
In response to this, a scientific session dedicated to 
micronekton was held during the 1997 PICES Annual 
Meeting in Pusan, Korea, that brought together a large 
number of experts within the North Pacific region.  It was 
at that time that a proposal was put forth to establish a 
PICES Working Group to assimilate knowledge of 
micronekton and their sampling in the North Pacific.  This 
led to the formation of Working Group 14 (WG 14) on 
Effective sampling of micronekton which met for the first 
time in 2000.  Initial summaries of the sampling conducted 
by each member nation were contained in a report 
presented at the PICES/CoML/IPRC workshop on “Impact 
of climate variability on observation and prediction of 
ecosystem and biodiversity changes in the North Pacific” 
held in Honolulu, in March 2001 (Brodeur, 2001, PICES 
Sci. Rep., 18:  86-90).  Prior to the 2000 PICES Annual 
Meeting in Hakodate, Japan, WG 14 co-sponsored a 
symposium on “Advanced techniques of sampling gear and 
acoustic surveys for estimation of fish abundance and 
PICES Press Vol. 13, No. 1  Appendix 4 
102  PICES Scientific Report No. 38 
behavior”, the proceedings of which has since been 
published electronically and available from Hokkaido 
University (Iida, 2003).  The final report of that group 
(Brodeur and Yamamura (Eds.), 2005, PICES Sci. Rep., 
30) synthesizes what is known about the distribution, 
biomass, growth, reproduction, and trophic relationships of 
micronekton in the North Pacific Ocean and adjacent seas, 
with a summary of the present state of sampling of these 
organisms.  It also attempted to identify key knowledge 
gaps that should be filled in the coming years. 
 
Included in the terms of reference was a request to examine 
the efficacy of available micronekton sampling gears and 
propose new sampling devices if the available ones were 
not adequate for the task.  One of the recommendations 
included in the WG 14 report is that although a number of 
gears are presently being used to sample micronekton in 
the North Pacific and other parts of the world’s oceans, 
there has been little effort expended in comparing the 
relative sampling efficiency and selectivity of these gears.  
The merits and shortcomings of many different gear types 
for sampling micronekton have been discussed at length in 
reports and publications arising from the SCOR Working 
Group on Methods of Sampling Micronekton (Pearcy, 
1981, Biol. Oceanogr., 2(2-4):  1-456).  In most studies, 
only one type of gear was used so it is impossible to deduce 
the various biases associated with each gear.  Moreover, 
sampling gears have become more advanced in time (see 
review by Wiebe and Benfield, 2003, Prog. Oceanogr., 56:  
7-136) and the older technologies have been abandoned, 
often without any inter-calibration with the gears that 
replace them.  This has hampered efforts to look at inter-
decadal or even regional comparisons of micronekton 
composition and biomass since very often, different gears 
are used. 
 
As a result of the recommendations of WG 14, PICES 
formed an Advisory Panel on Micronekton sampling inter-
calibration experiment (MIE-AP) in 2002, to conduct a 
field study to compare micronekton sampling gears and 
other quantifying technologies such as acoustics and visual 
sampling methods, similar to that done by the International 
Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in the North 
Atlantic Ocean utilizing mainly plankton gears (Wiebe et 
al., 2002, ICES Coop. Res., 250, 25 pp).  The role of MIE-
AP was to oversee planning and implementation of the 
field program and dissemination of the results to the 
scientific community. 
 
Initial field work 
 
A preferred location is thought to be one that is known to 
contain high densities of all major micronektonic 
categories (midwater fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans), 
and thus it would have to be an area that has been sampled 
previously to a great extent.  It should also be an area that 
is relatively uniform over various spatial and temporal 
scales, and exhibits a high degree of repeatability among 
repeat tows taken at the same station, so that the majority 
of variability between tows could be ascribed to gear 
differences.  It is desirable that the ocean conditions in the 
study area be relatively calm to facilitate deployment and 
recovery of complex gear types.  Finally, the station should 
be in relatively deep water but also close to shore to 
minimize transit time.  Although there are several areas 
within the PICES region that meet these requirements, the 
one recommended by MIE-AP is the area off the Hawaiian 
Islands.  A pilot cruise was organized by the Panel to occur 
just prior to the PICES Annual Meeting in Honolulu to take 
advantage of the possibility that many potential participants 
would be attending the meeting.  The leeward side of Oahu 
was chosen as the location for the experiment for several 
reasons including the benign weather conditions and 
relatively homogeneous distribution of the target taxa. 
 
Ship time was secured on the NOAA research vessel, the 
Oscar Elton Sette, based in Honolulu, Hawaii.  This vessel 
is over 70 m long and has the capability to tow large dual-
warp trawls requiring doors as well as large and small 
single-warp midwater trawls.  The ship also has several 
additional oceanographic winches equipped with 
conducting cable and sufficient deck space to stage several 
gear types.  It also has advanced acoustic and 
oceanographic sampling capabilities needed for such a 
study. 
 
An international team of experts in micronekton taxonomy 
and sampling and acoustics (Table 1) was assembled for 
the cruise, and the ship sampled continuously for seven 
days, alternating among three different gears (Fig. 2):  a

and night periods, avoiding the crepuscular migration

tows ≈ 550 m,  (2) Night tows ≈

sampling was entirely in a deep layer (typically targeting 
550 m), while nighttime sampling was mainly targeted the 
upper 120 m of the water column, although one series was 
conducted at depth to sample the non-migratory layer 
(Fig. 3). 
 
Preliminary results from the cruise were presented at a 
MIE-AP Workshop convened prior to PICES XIII.  It was 
found that while small sampling gears provided similar 
micronekton abundances, densities measured using both 
HN and IKT were generally significantly higher than 
densities obtained by Cobb trawl for main taxonomic 
groups sampled during the survey (Fig. 4), in part because 
these nets had finer mesh sizes than the Cobb trawl.  The 
Cobb trawl, however, caught substantially larger organisms 
than either of the other gears due principally to its large 
mouth opening. 
 
Deployment of the three types of gear resulted in a 
collection of approximately 43-46 species of fishes from 
24-25 families.  At present, these numbers exclude all 
representatives of the rather speciose midwater family 
Myctophidae, which were not identified to species at sea.  
The majority of fish families (21) encountered during our 
sampling are truly mesopelagic with only few 
representatives from coastal and epipelagic communities. 
 
The quantitative composition of the entire fish collection 
was very uneven, with myctophids contributing close to 
60% of all specimens collected.  The second most abundant

were in the family Gonostomatidae (largely due to 
abundant and ubiquitous Cyclothone spp.) which totals 
close to 38% of the total catch.  The remaining families 
contributed less than 4% to the total fish collection.

Based on our preliminary taxonomic treatment, we 
calculated basic community indices to estimate diversity, 
evenness and species richness (Fig. 5).  As seen for 
densities of particular midwater groups, these indices are 
very similar for the HN and IKT gears.  This is particularly 
evident for the number of species and for daytime diversity 
and evenness indices.  Both day and night deployment of 
the Cobb Trawl clearly procured more species per trawl, 
which is also reflected in the higher diversity and evenness 
indices.  After completing our taxonomic analysis, we 
expect to analyze additional data on ichthyoplankton and 
invertebrate abundances and species composition to 
complement inter-gear comparison and estimate relative 
catchability for each gear. 
 
In terms of acoustics, two prominent scattering layers were 
observed at ~10-140 m and ~450-750 m.  The surface layer 
was due primarily to organisms migrating to the surface at 
night, while the deep scattering layer was a permanent 
feature that may be representative of non-migratory 
organisms and/or organisms that migrate up from deeper 
water during the night (Fig. 3).  The water column between 
the two prominent scattering layers lacked significant 
backscatter indicating that the water column was basically 
devoid of organisms outside the layers, which was verified 
by a single haul during daytime that fished only the upper 
300 m and came back nearly empty.

Future directions  
 
Preliminary analysis from the 2004 experiment indicated 
that individual gears sampled different, often non-
overlapping, size groups of plankton and micronekton.  
This appeared to be relevant for our ability to interpret the 
data acquired from the multiple acoustic frequencies.  
However, it also points out that successful inter-
comparisons during future cruises requires a closer scrutiny 
of gear-types and net mesh sizes prior to the experiment.  
Adoption of a “standard” sampling gear (such as a 
Rectangular Midwater Trawl (RMT 1+8) or a 3-m IKMT) 
and mesh sizes was suggested to facilitate comparisons.  
Based on the success and preliminary findings of the first 
cruise, MIE-AP recommended conducting a second 
experiment within the subarctic North Pacific using a larger 
variety of micronektonic sampling gears.  This cruise is 
tentatively planned for summer 2005 (or 2006, depending 
on ship time availability) in the Bering Sea.

Recent results of the micronekton sampling inter-calibration experiment 
 
by Orio Yamamura 
 
Micronekton (osteichthyes, cephalopods and crustaceans) 
are ubiquitous in oceanic and neritic areas and are an 
important component of marine ecosystems.  In terms of 
body size and swimming ability, they are intermediate 
between mesozooplankton and nekton, so they have an 
important role in transporting organic materials from the 
productive euphotic zones to the less productive 
mesopelagic layers through diurnal vertical migration.  
Furthermore, in subarctic ecosystems micronekton have 
indispensable roles in smoothing the seasonal variation of 
prey availability during the less productive autumn and 
winter seasons. 
 
MIE-1 cruise 
 
The PICES Working Group (WG 14) on Effective sampling 
of micronekton was established in 1997, under the direction 
of the Biological Oceanography Committee, to tabulate 
information on micronekton in the North Pacific, including 
taxonomic composition, biomass, sampling methods and 
trophic relationships.  At the recommendations of WG 14, 
PICES formed an Advisory Panel on Micronekton 
sampling inter-calibration experiment (MIE-AP) in 2002, 
to conduct a field study to compare micronekton sampling 
gears and other quantifying technologies such as acoustics 
and visual sampling methods.  The initial field survey, 
MIE-1, was carried out aboard the NOAA R/V Oscar Elton 
Sette in October 2004, off Oahu, Hawaii.  Three sampling 
gears were compared:  a 140-m pelagic Cobb trawl, a 4-m 
Hokkaido University Rectangular Frame Trawl (HUFT), 
and a 1.8-m Isaacs-Kidd Mid-water Trawl (IKMT).  For 
detailed description and results of that survey, please refer 
to Brodeur et al. in PICES Press Vol. 13(1), pp. 7–11. 
MIE-2 cruise 
 
In September–October 2005, AP-MIE conducted its second 
cruise aboard the R/V Hokko-maru (902 t) of the Hokkaido 
National Fisheries Research Institute (HNFRI), Japan.  
Hokko-maru, launched in 2004, is a state-of-the-art 65-m 
stern trawler with a MOCNESS-10 and has capabilities to 
deploy other mid-water sampling gears, including stern 
trawls equipped with a MULTI-SAMPLER (an opening-
closing multiple cod-end system, Simrad Inc.).  Other gears 
compared during the cruise were the Matsuda–Oozeki–Hu 
Trawl (MOHT; Oozeki et al., 2004) and HUFT (Fig. 1).  
The former gear is a 5-m
2
 rectangular mid-water trawl with 
a newly developed depressor, which enables the net to be 
towed at a desired depth at higher speed (5 knots) with a 
near perpendicular and stable angle of 8°.  For the latter 
gear, two nets with different mesh sizes (3 mm and 9 mm) 
were used separately.  In addition to the sampling gears, 
backscattering from the scattering layers was recorded 
using a Simrad EK-60 echosounder with 38, 70, 120 and 
200 kHz transducers.  The scientists onboard were:  Orio 
Yamamura (HNFRI), Hiroya Sugisaki (Tohoku NFRI), 
Kazuhiro Sadayasu, Shinsuke Abe and Ryuichi Matsukura 
(all Hokkaido University).  Since the cruise overlapped the 
dates of PICES XIV in Vladivostok, Russia, members of 
AP-MIE from countries other than Japan were not able to 
participate in the cruise. 
 
Basically, every fishing gear was towed at 4 stations which 
were all located at the outer shelf of the Doto area, off 
southeastern Hokkaido Island (bottom depth 380–480 m), 
during the daytime and nighttime, with an exception of MT 
(rope trawl with multi-sampler), which was towed at

2 stations only during the daytime.  Every gear sampled the  
0–300 m layer.  In total, the myctophid Diaphus theta was 
dominant in both numbers (>80%) and weight (>70%).  A 
brief comparison of catch efficiency of different gears for 
D. theta revealed that MOHT was evidently the most 
effective gear for the sampling of micronekton (Fig. 2).

MIE-2:  MOCNESS-10 (MOC), Hokkaido University Frame Trawl 
(FMT), Matsuda–Oozeki–Hu Trawl (MOHT), and rope trawl with  
multi-sampler (MT).  Numbers are standardized so that  
MOCNESS-10 during daytime = 1.0. 
 
MIE-3 cruise 
 
After the MIE-2 cruise, AP members were keen to find 
ship time for some unfinished business.  A direct 
comparison between IKMT and MOHT was essential 
because there are so much historical data collected with an 
IKMT.  After two years, the third experiment was carried 
out onboard the R/V Oscar Dyson in the eastern Bering 
Sea, from September 18–27, 2007.  Despite the vessel 
being engaged in an NPAFC/BASIS salmon survey, Dr. 
Jim Murphy of the Auke Bay Laboratory (NOAA/NMFS) 
kindly donated ship time for our experiment.  The scientists 
participating in the experiment were:  Orio Yamamura 
(HNFRI), Hiroki Yasuma (HU) and Andrey Suntsov 
(NWFSC, NOAA).  Although 48–72 hours of ship time 
were expected for the experiment, the actual duration was 
only 24 hours due to the extraordinarily rough weather in 
the Bering Sea during autumn.  The gears compared during 
this cruise were a 1.8-m IKMT and a MOHT.  A Cantrawl 
300/262 rope trawl was also included in the arsenal, but the 
limited time window excluded this gear from the 
comparison.  To reduce the time required for each 
deployment, a site adjacent to St. Paul Island, with a 
bottom depth of ca. 60 m, was chosen for the experiment 
where age-0 walleye pollock were densely distributed.  The 
sampling was in a day/night sequential design, in which 
different gears were towed sequentially at each location, 
with triplicate samples collected during daylight and night 
at the same ship speed (3 knots).  Aside from the sampling 
gears, backscattering from the scattering layer was 
recorded using a Simrad EK-60 echosounder with 15, 38, 
70, 120 and 200 kHz transducers.  The catch was 
dominated by age-0 walleye pollock (>99%), offering a 
good opportunity for gear comparison (Fig. 3).  The 
catchabilities of the nets were compared by relative number 
of pollock per volume of seawater filtered by the nets.  The 
nets showed similar catchability during the daytime (1.1 
times larger for MOHT in density estimate), but MOHT 
showed significantly higher catchability in night sampling 
(2.8 times higher).  The fact that the catch efficiencies 
during the daytime were similar for both gears indicates 
that visual avoidance by age-0 pollock was virtually 
identical between these gears.  The 2.8 times difference for 
nighttime tows may represent the difference in the stability 
of net angle and net mouth opening during hauls.

How do we proceed? 
 
We have undertaken 3 inter-calibration experiments, 
providing data for direct and indirect comparison of 8 
different micronekton sampling gears.  The results suggest 
that MOHT is the most reliable sampling gear for 
micronekton.  Nevertheless, a brief comparison between 
acoustic and net sampling suggests that MOHT still 
underestimates the standing stock by >50%.  Fortunately, 
some data sets are available for direct comparison between 
results of acoustic and net sampling.  We are planning to 
include a comparison in the final AP-MIE report to be 
submitted to BIO next fall at PICES XVII in Dalian, China.
