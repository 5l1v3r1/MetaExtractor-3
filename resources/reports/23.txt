Foreword 
 
This publication by PICES Working Group 15 brings together reviews of the state of knowledge of 
harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the six PICES member countries of the North Pacific (Canada, Japan, 
People’s Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, Russia and the United States of America) plus 
Mexico, up to 2001.  Both HABs harming humans due to the consumption of contaminated marine 
products and those harming marine life are involved;  both have major economic and social impacts.  The 
reports summarize the impacts and provide insights into the understanding of the ecology of HABs in 
northern Pacific countries.  All nations report severe HAB problems, often due to the same species of 
algae.  These problems appear to be chronic in some countries, and worsening in others;  the severity of 
HABs will likely continue into the foreseeable future.  The need and potential value of co-operation in 
this and other similarly-affected regions is emphasized in this report.

Background and objectives 
 
This report constitutes the first publication of 
PICES Working Group 15 (WG 15) on Ecology of 
harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the North Pacific.  
PICES, the intergovernmental North Pacific 
Marine Science Organization, derives its nickname 
from “Pacific ICES”, the 10-year-old North 
Pacific counterpart to the 100 year-old ICES 
(International Council for the Exploration of the 
Sea) in the North Atlantic.  The current member 
countries of PICES are Canada, Japan, People’s  
Republic of China, Republic of Korea, Russia and 
the United States.   
 
HAB is the internationally preferred collective 
name for harmful phenomena, also known 
variously as “red tides”, “brown tides”, and by 
similar names which may, confusingly, include 
harmless blooms or blooms without visible 
manifestations.  They have freshwater counterparts 
but only the marine forms are considered here.  
The subjects harmed by HABs are either humans 
or marine fauna. WG 15 was formed as an 
initiative of both the Marine Environmental 
Quality (MEQ) and Biological Oceanography 
(BIO) Committees at the Eighth Annual Meeting 
of PICES in Vladivostok in 1998.  It was 
established in recognition of dramatically 
increasing reports of HABs, not only in the North 
Pacific but also in the coastal regions of the world 
as a whole.  Its goals are to promote the exchange 
of information and cooperation between the 
PICES member countries to assist in coping with 
HABs.  A similar working group has been in 
existence under various guises in ICES for more 
than a decade, the North Atlantic being similarly 
afflicted with various types of HABs, including 
most of those mentioned here.   
 
The membership and terms of reference for  
WG 15 are shown in Appendices A and B.  As a 
first priority, the Working Group agreed that the 
state of knowledge on HABs and their impacts in 
each of the member countries needed to be 
reviewed to serve as a baseline for determination 
of regional needs.  Other goals were to encourage 
regional communications, collaborative studies, 
standardization of methodologies, data sharing 
and, possibly, training initiatives.  The interim 
activities of WG 15 are summarized in 2000-2001 
Annual reports (Appendix C) and in Workshop 
report on Taxonomy and identification of HAB 
species and data management (Appendix D). 
 
This is the first group to establish linkages among 
HAB studies in the six PICES member countries 
but it is not the first Pacific-based international 
organization to investigate HABs.  In Southeast 
Asia, a HAB component was a significant part of a 
seven-year Cooperative Program in Marine 
Science, a project sponsored by ASEAN-Canada. 
The program included within-country training 
workshops for all the ASEAN countries:  Malaysia 
(including Sabah and Sarawak), Indonesia, Brunei, 
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam 
(which joined shortly before the program 
concluded).  A communication network, based in 
the Philippines, was left in place after the program 
ended.  WESTPAC, another regional scientific 
organization under IOC, has sponsored meetings 
and training courses on HABs in the western 
Pacific, and DANIDA and APEC have also 
focused on Pacific HABs mostly in Southeast 
Asia.  IOC has a semi-permanent office dealing 
with global HABs that is located in Denmark.  
Most recently IOC-UNESCO has established an 
international program concerned with promoting 
the study of the ecology of HABs on a global 
scale, termed GEOHAB.  At present most of the 
activity has been at the national level, most 
notably ECOHAB in the United States, but with 
national programs formed or forming in several 
other PICES member countries. 
 
Our goal in preparing this report has been to 
provide a useful and practical guide to HAB-
related problems, literature and related 
research/monitoring efforts in northern Pacific 
nations.  For example, the literature relating to 
each country deliberately includes obscure local 
literature that might otherwise be missed by 
outsiders.  The national reports provide a basis for 
future annual incident updates similar to those of 
the ICES working group.  The activities of WG 15 
have also brought to light discrepancies in 
approach and methodologies in the reporting and 
study of HAB data by the member countries (see 
3
Summary and conclusions).  Although there are 
some differences in detail among PICES member 
countries, this work has emphasized that all PICES 
countries suffer from common problems and 
challenges due to HABs.  In many ways, HABs 
have created a bridge of understanding among 
nations that share bodies of water and coastlines. 
These nations are, in fact, more similar to one 
another than a single nation with multi-ocean  
 
coastlines such as Canada, Russia or the United 
States.   
 
This commonality should help to unite HAB 
researchers in PICES nations in the future, 
motivating many international collaborative efforts 
that strive to better understand the ecology and 
oceanography of North Pacific and global HABs.

History of HAB investigations in Japan 
  
In Japan, one of the old historical books entitled 
“The History of Great Japan” (Dai Nippon Shi), 
edited more than 300 years ago, described 16 
cases of red tide, seven in freshwater and the 
rest in the marine environment.  The oldest was 
an occurrence in 731 AD.  A case that occurred 
in 1234 AD was reported to cause fish mass 
mortality and human fatalities after eating 
fishes.  The first scientific study on red tides was 
made by Nishikawa in 1900 on Noctiluca 
scintillans.  From 1900 to 1950 the number of 
reports on red tides was about 10-25 per decade, 
and after 1950 it gradually increased.  In 1970s, 
the number jumped drastically to more than 200 
cases per year along with the development of 
heavy industry in coastal terrestrial zone and 
fish aquaculture industry in marine embayments.  
Fish mass mortality cases with serious economic 
loss also increased.  After 1970, effort and large 
budgets were devoted to the elucidation of the 
biology and ecology of red tide organisms and 
their blooming mechanisms, modeling and 
mitigation methods.  
 
Two types of harmful algal blooms (HABs) are 
known in Japan.  The first one is a noxious algal 
bloom associated with the mass mortality of 
marine organisms, especially fish in aquaculture 
cages and shellfish hanging from rafts.  Most of 
the noxious blooms cause water discoloration, 
i.e. red tides, but less than 20% of the red tides, 
as the term is used here, cause harmful effects.  
Most management and scientific research efforts 
have been devoted to the harmful ones, but 
successive occurrences of different harmful 
species such as Chattonella, Gymnodinium and 
Heterocapsa along with changing environmental 
oceanographic conditions, make people 
concerned, feeling that the fight against red tides 
is endless. 
 
The second type of HAB is a toxic algal bloom 
causing contamination of shellfish, either PSP 
(paralytic shellfish poisoning) or DSP (diarrhetic 
shellfish poisoning).  The amount of toxin in 
shellfish and the cell number of toxic 
dinoflagellates are monitored regularly by local 
governments.  Closures of aquaculture areas for 
the harvesting and marketing of shellfish occur 
depending on the amount of toxin, not the toxic 
plankton concentration.  Therefore not all 
blooms of toxic plankton are recorded as HAB 
occurrences.  Toxic plankton blooms with toxin 
contamination lower than the permitted level are 
not recorded as HAB occurrences. 
 
In some fishing villages in northern Japan, 
warning about possible toxin contamination 
might be passed on from ancestors and known 
among elderly local fishermen.  There are 
several traditional folk tales such as “Do not eat 
shellfish during snow water runoff into the sea”, 
i.e. it warns that shellfish may become inedible 
in early spring.  After modern aquaculture 
developed, fishermen tried to sell their products 
year round but closure of marketing happens 
often in the spring.  Thus we notice the wisdom 
from the experience that led to the folk tale.  
Perhaps this indicates that toxin contamination 
of shellfish has repeatedly occurred almost every 
year over a long time, leading to many tragedies 
among the local people.  
7
 
The first recorded cases that were undoubtedly 
PSP and DSP occurred in 1948 and 1976, 
respectively.  In the early 1970s, shellfish 
aquaculture techniques were more fully 
developed and the aquaculture industry spread 
into various areas, mainly along the coast of 
northern Japan.  But at the same time several 
cases of human poisoning (PSP and DSP) were 
also reported.   
 
The Fisheries Agency together with the Ministry 
of Health and Welfare set guidelines for 
monitoring and marketing regulation.  After 
implementation of the official monitoring 
program there was no poisoning by marine 
products sold in market. 
 
Red tides that harm marine life 
 
The number of algal bloom occurrences in the 
western part of Japan (Seto Inland Sea, Kyushu 
area, Tosa Bay and Kumano-nada:  for locations 
see Figure 1) is shown in Figure 2.  In the Seto 
Inland Sea red tide observations were very rare 
in the 1950s.  Then, they dramatically increased 
and reached a peak of about 300 per year in the 
mid-1970s.  After this period, they gradually 
decreased and recently remained stable.  The 
number is now around 100 per year.  This is 
thought to be mainly due to governmental 
regulations to control eutrophication based on 
laws such as the law concerning special 
measures for conservation of the environment of 
the Seto Inland Sea (“Seto Inland Sea Law”) 
enforced in 1973.  On the other hand, in the 
other three areas, the number of red tide events 
seems not to have decreased in last two decades.  
The sighting ranges per annum are 60 to 110 in 
Kyushu area, 3 to 16 in Tosa Bay, and 0 to 9 in 
Kumano-nada. 
 
The number of red tides which have actually 
caused fisheries damage in Japan is shown in 
Figure 3.  In last three decades, it seems to have 
been relatively stable.  The numbers range from 
20 to 50 per annum.

Figure 4 indicates the economic loss caused by 
red tides in Japan.  Maximum economic loss was 
recorded in the summer of 1972.  In that year the 
raphidoflagellate Chattonella red tide caused 
severe damage to cultured yellowtail in the 
eastern part of the Seto Inland Sea.  The loss 
was about seven billion yen (about US$70 
million).  Since then, the loss per year has 
decreased but, even in the 1990s, severe 
fisheries damage was sometimes recorded. 
 
Table 1 demonstrates the major red tide species 
in Japan and the number of fisheries damage 
events due to these species.  The most hazardous 
species are Chattonella marina, C. antiqua and 
dinoflagellate Gymnodinium mikimotoi.  These 
three species mainly kill finfish and have 
frequently caused very severe fisheries damage 
of more than 100 million yen (about one million 
US$).  The dinoflagellate Heterocapsa 
circularisquama recorded for the first time from 
a small, semi-enclosed bay connected to Tosa 
Bay in 1988 was newly added to the list of 
hazardous species.  This species only shows a 
harmful effect on shellfish, particularly on 
bivalves such as edible oysters, pearl oysters, 
short-necked clams and so on. Very severe 
fisheries damage caused by this species were 
occurred four times in last decade.  In addition, 
the dinoflagellates Cocholodinium polykrikoides 
and Gonyaulax polygramma and 
raphidoflagellate Heterosigma akashiwo are also 
hazardous species in Japan.

Plankton blooms toxic to humans  
 
Almost all microalgae responsible for various 
types of fish and shellfish poisoning of humans, 
such as PSP, DSP, ASP (amnesic shellfish 
poisoning), NSP (neurotoxic shellfish 
poisoning) and ciguatera (ciguatera fish 
poisoning), are present in Japanese coastal 
waters.  Among them, PSP and DSP toxin 
contaminations in marine shellfish and filter 
feeders have been monitored officially since 
1995 at 67 sea areas and 173 sampling stations 
 
The official monitoring program started in 1978 
in northern Japan and some other areas where 
shellfish aquaculture operated.  Several trials to 
reduce toxins in shellfish, including the canning 
of scallops, were operated on a very limited 
scale.  No fully effective countermeasure 
applicable to variety of affected marine products 
has been discovered and regular toxin 
monitoring is the only way to prevent the 
occurrence of poisoning.  Modeling of bloom-
forming mechanisms of the causative organisms 
and toxin accumulation in shellfish has also 
been tried in several ways in order to create a 
prediction system, but the current situation is 
still far from a good system, mostly because of 
incomplete data acquisition and accumulation.  
This is the result of low cell number occurrences 
during blooming of causative plankton and the 
difficulty in analysis of shellfish physiology. 
 
Among them A. tamarense and A. catenella 
appear in wider areas and often cause toxin 
contamination in scallops, mussels, clams and 
tunicates.  In the first decade after the start of 
the monitoring program the area affected was 
mainly in northern Japan, but it gradually 
expanded to western Japan (Fig. 5).  Closures of 
affected areas are decided by toxin 
quantification using the mouse bioassay, based 
on a modified AOAC method.  Four MU 
(Mouse Units) of toxin in 1 gram of edible part 
of sample is the highest tolerable quarantine 
level.  If the toxicity exceeds the level, closure 
of the area for harvesting the sample species is 
declared and three consecutive weeks of lower 
toxicity than that level is necessary to lift the 
closure.  This means that it takes a minimum 21 
days to re-open the market.  The economic 
damage due to PSP toxin contamination is 
measured by the duration of closure.  This 
monitoring and management system has been 
working successfully, and no PSP cases have

4.0MU/g  for each period, with the affected shellfishes,

occurred so far from eating shellfish sold in 
market, although some accidental cases have 
been reported from the consumption of shellfish 
collected by the victims.  
 
DSP causative plankton  
 
Dinoflagellates responsible for DSP 
contamination in Japanese waters are 
Dinophysis fortii and D. acuminata.  Some other 
dinoflagellates such as D. mitra and D. tripos 
are also known to produce DSP toxins, but 
accumulation of toxins produced by these is less 
than the quarantine level.  Closure of the 
affected area is decided by toxin quantification 
using mouse bioassay.  A level of 0.05 MU in 1 
gram of edible part of shellfish toxin is the 
highest permissive level.  The management 
policy for the closure of aquaculture areas is 
same as that for PSP.  After the operation of the 
monitoring program, the area affected was 
mainly in northern Japan (Fig. 6).  In western 
Japan, D. fortii mysteriously never causes DSP 
toxin contamination in shellfish.  After the 
establishment of the monitoring system, no 
poisoning case has been reported. 
 
Other toxic microalgae 
 
The diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia is one of the 
commonest phytoplankton in Japanese waters, 
and about 10 different species bloom 
successively almost year round.  Among them 
the production of domoic acid, which is 
responsible for ASP in North America, has been 
confirmed in P. multiseries, P. delicatissima and 
P. pseudodelicatissima.  However, domoic acid 
contamination in wild and aquacultured shellfish 
has not been detected so far, in spite of very 
intensive surveys conducted by the Japan 
Fisheries Agency and several universities.  
Therefore no regular monitoring program is set 
for ASP toxins. 
 
For NSP and ciguatera, there is no monitoring 
program, although Gymnodinium breve and 
Gambierdiscus toxicus, causative organisms 
respectively for those types of poisoning, are 
sometimes found in western Japan, toxin 
contamination in shellfish and fish has not been 
detected.  
Mitigation  
 
The incidence of fish killing red tides 
dramatically increased in frequency and scale in 
Japanese coastal waters, especially in the Seto 
Inland Sea, during 1960s and 1970s (see above), 
and huge fishery damages occurred repeatedly.  
The incidents have decreased thereafter as a 
long-term trend during the last two decades, but 
the number of known causative species has 
increased.  The average economic loss 
associated with these red tides is about one 
billion Japanese yen per year.   
 
Therefore, there is an urgent and compelling 
need for bloom mitigation strategies in 
aquaculture areas.  In this section, plans for 
impact prevention of red tides attempted in the 
past are summarized, and the possibility of the 
utilization of diatoms as competitors for 
nutrients is described.  Also the use of 
pathogenic microbes, such as bacteria and 
viruses, is introduced as these may be promising 
tools in reducing the impacts of red tides in the 
future.   
 
Shellfish poisoning events (PSP and DSP) are 
also serious problems in Japan, but mitigation 
methods for these are not considered in this 
report because the strategies for these toxic 
blooms are expected to be different from those 
for red tides.  
 
Plans for counteracting red tides attempted in 
the past in Japan 
 
Figure 7 illustrates the attempts at counteracting 
the impact of red tides in the past in Japan 
(Shirota 1989).  The counteraction techniques 
are roughly divided into two categories, indirect 
and direct methods.  Indirect methods are 
basically important as prevention of red tide 
occurrences on a long-term scale.  Laws for 
regulations were established for the conservation 
of environments in the coastal sea such as the 
Seto Inland Sea.  These laws have been effective 
in decreasing the direct discharge of polluted 
waste water into the coastal areas.

The resulting decline of nitrogen and 
phosphorus concentration in the water and 
sediments has led to a decrease of incidents of 
red tides.  Developments of fish culture 
techniques, such as the use of "moist pellets" as 
a substitute for raw bait, keeping the proper 
scale and density of fish in aquaculture sites, and 
transfer of net cages from red tide-prone areas, 
were effective in reducing the negative impacts 
of red tides.  However, the most prevailing 
method is to stop feeding cultured fish just 
before and during red tides.  This effectively 
reduces the mortality of fish in the cages, 
especially of yellowtail.

Fig. 7 Counterplans at impact prevention of red tides attempted in the past in Japan (Shirota 1989).
As shown in Figure 7, rather many methods for 
the direct control of red tides had been attempted 
before 1985, but no physical and chemical 
control was successful as a whole.  In other 
words, nature is beyond our direct control.  
Thereafter, these chemical and physical control 
options have received little attention.  Shirota 
(1989) suggested that one promising strategy 
could be to treat red tides with flocculants such 
as clay, which scavenge particles, including 
algal cells, from seawater and carry them to 
bottom sediments.  The feasibility of the 
treatment with clay has also been vigorously 
investigated in Korea in recent years.  Field 
trials near fish farms have been successful to 
some extent.  However, before this application 
can be implemented, considerable study is 
essential to determine the fate and effects of 
sedimented cells and toxins on benthic animals 
and the collateral mortality of co-occurring 
planktonic organisms.  Also, the decomposition 
of sedimented biomass and resulting oxygen 
depletion needs to be determined (SCOR-IOC 
1998).   
 
At present in Japan, treatment with clay is not 
practically applied because of high costs and the 
possible bad effects on marine organisms 
mentioned above.  
 
Biological control of red tides  
 
The biological control of red tides by using 
copepods and bivalves such as oysters has been 
examined, but the results were minimal because 
of the huge scale of red tides (Shirota 1989).  
Before 1989, microorganisms such as bacteria, 
viruses, parasites, and harmless phytoplankton 
15
 
such as diatoms, had not been investigated for 
the application to biological control of red tides 
except for a few studies on bacteria.  These 
microorganisms appear to be promising control 
agents against red tides, as they can be abundant 
in marine ecosystems, proliferate rapidly, and 
sometimes are host-specific (SCOR-IOC 1998). 
Basic studies have been conducted on biological 
control of red tides using microorganisms in 
Japan during the last decade.  Feasibility is 
discussed in the following sections on diatoms, 
bacteria, and viruses, and some possible 
mitigation strategies are proposed.  
 
Prevention of red tides by diatoms  
 
Aiming at controlling red tides due to 
Chattonella spp. (C. antiqua and C. marina) by 
using diatoms, a research project sponsored by 
the Environment Agency of Japan, "Technical 
development on the ecological control of 
noxious red tides", was conducted mainly by 
scientists of the Nansei National Fisheries 
Research Institute of Fisheries Agency from 
1989 to 1993.  
 
It is known empirically that Chattonella red 
tides occur when diatoms are scarce in surface 
water (Imai et al. 1998b).  Diatoms (mainly 
Centrales) can dominate over Chattonella spp. 
due to their higher growth rates.  However, 
diatoms form resting spores under conditions of 
nutrient limitation, especially of nitrogen, and 
they rapidly sink to the sea bottom.  
Accordingly, stratification and resulting 
exhaustion of nutrients will contribute to the 
formation of diatom resting spores.  A timely 
mixing event, resulting in nutrient supply to the 
surface layer, after an appropriate stratification, 
which causes the nutrient depletion and sinking 
and/or inactivation of diatoms, is thought to be 
essential for the occurrence of Chattonella red 
tides.  
 
Chattonella red tides are seeded by the 
germination of cysts (Imai and Itoh 1987).  
Diatom resting cells occur at densities of  
10
3
-10
6
 /g (wet sediment) in the coastal sea 
bottom (Itakura et al. 1997).  Chattonella cysts 
can germinate in the dark at the sea bottom, but 
diatom resting cells need light for germination 
and/or rejuvenation.  If a sufficient intensity of 
light is provided to the diatom resting stage cells 
on the sea bottom, they are expected to 
germinate vigorously, and vegetative cells will 
be supplied to the surface layer (Fig. 8).  Growth 
of diatoms will exhaust nutrients in the surface 
layer, which will reduce the growth of 
Chattonella.  The crucial point of this mitigation 
strategy (prevention of Chattonella red tides) is 
the timing of irradiation to the sea bottom.  The 
best timing is just after the supply of nutrients to 
the surface by a mixing event with a low cell 
density of Chattonella in a closed embayment.

tides using diatoms.  Light is irradiated to the 
sea bottom in order to accelerate the germination 
and/or rejuvenation of diatom resting stage cells.  
Resulting diatom vegetative cells will grow and 
exhaust nutrients in the surface layer, and 
suppress the growth of Chattonella. 
 
 
Prevention of red tides by algicidal bacteria 
 
Aiming at controlling red tides by the use of 
bacteria, several research projects sponsored by 
the Fisheries Agency were conducted by 
scientists of several universities and the National 
Fisheries Research Institute from 1989 to 1999.  
Temporal fluctuations of algicidal 
microorganisms acting on the raphidophytes C. 
antiqua and H. akashiwo, were studied in 
northern Hiroshima Bay in the Seto Inland Sea 
(Imai et al. 1998a).  The dynamics of H. 
16
 
akashiwo killers revealed a close relationship 
with that of H. akashiwo populations (Fig. 9).  
H. akashiwo killers followed the increase of H. 
akashiwo cells, reaching a maximal level after 
the beginning of the decline of H. akashiwo.  
They maintained a high level for at least one 
week after the crash of bloom, and then 
decreased.  C. antiqua killers consistently 
remained at low densities during the period of 
the H. akashiwo red tides.  This result clearly 
indicates that algicidal microorganisms 
specifically associated with the occurrence and 
crash of H. akashiwo red tides, and contributed 
to the rapid termination of the red tides in the 
coastal seas.  
 
Table 2 shows the list of algicidal bacteria 
isolated from the Japanese coastal seas 
(Yoshinaga 2000). These bacteria were 
classified phylogenetically using a database of 
SSU rDNA.  Many algicidal bacteria are new 
species.  The majority of algicidal bacteria are 
categorized into two groups, γ-proteobacteria 
(mainly the genera Alteromonas and 
Pseudoalteromonas) and a Cytophaga / 
Flexibacter / Bacteroides (CFB) group (mainly 
the genus Cytophaga).  The algicidal bacteria, 
belonging to CFB group, are generally of the 
direct attack type, and the γ-proteobacteria are 
involved in the extracellular production of 
algicidal matter. SSU rDNA will be used for the 
development of PCR primers and DNA-probes 
for FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) 
for specific detection of these algicidal bacteria. 
 
A new aspect of ecology of algicidal bacteria 
has been the discovery that huge numbers of 
algicidal microorganisms (mainly bacteria) 
associate on the surface of macroalgae such as 
Ulva sp. (Chlorophyta) and Gelidium sp. 
(Rhodophyta) (Imai et al. in preparation).  
Maximum numbers of about 10
5
 - 10
6
 g
-1
 (wet 
weight) were detected for Gymnodinium 
mikimotoi (Dinophyceae), Fibrocapsa japonica 
(Raphidophyceae), and H. akashiwo 
(Raphidophyceae) (Fig. 10).  
 
Algicidal microorganisms were also abundant in 
seawater collected at a seaweed bed in Obama 
Bay and Osaka Bay.  Based on these findings, 
we propose a new prevention strategy of red 
tides using macroalgae in aquaculture areas (Fig. 
11).  Co-culturing of Gelidium sp. and/or Ulva 
sp. and finfish such as red sea bream or 
yellowtail is proposed as an effective measure in 
cage culture.  Many algicidal bacteria will be 
continually released from the surface of 
macroalgae to seawater, and contribute to reduce 
cell densities of phytoplankton, including 
harmful species. 
 
Consequently, these bacteria can probably play 
an important role in preventing occurrences of 
noxious red tides.  This strategy may be 
effective in semi-enclosed and small inlets.  
Feasibility studies will be needed for the 
practical use of macroalgae in the future.  The 
most excellent merit aspect of this strategy is 
that macroalgae have no negative image for 
aquaculture farmers and consumers.  Moreover, 
Ulva sp. is actually being utilized as 
supplementary food for red seabream in some 
cage cultures in Mie and Ehime Prefectures in 
Japan 
 
Extermination of red tides by algicidal viruses 
 
Algicidal viruses appear to be promising tools 
for the reduction or extermination of noxious red 
tides by virtue of their high host specificity and 
high replication rate. 
 
In H. akashiwo red tides, HaV virus was found 
and isolated in the final stage of the red tide 
(Nagasaki et al. 1994, Nagasaki and Yamaguchi 
1997).  Viruses were also found and isolated 
from the notorious bivalve-killer dinoflagellate 
Heterocapsa circularisquama (Tarutani et al. 
submitted).  For the encounter of viruses and 
host algal cells, relatively high cell densities of 
red tide organisms are thought to be essential. 
 
Hence, viruses cannot be used as a tool for the 
prevention of red tides but as an effective tool 
for the extermination of red tides.  As viruses 
have an extremely high replication rate, they can 
be utilized as a trump card after the failure of the 
prevention of red tides by diatoms and algicidal 
bacteria at earlier stages.

Introduction 
 
Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been 
spreading and increasing along the coast of 
China in the past two decades, causing damage 
to the marine environment and posing a threat to 
human health (Zou 1992; Qi et al. 1993; Tseng et 
al. 1993; Zhu et al. 1995).  Because HABs are 
globally distributed and are integral parts of 
marine and brackish-water ecosystems, the 
central research problem can be addressed 
comprehensively and effectively only through 
international, interdisciplinary, and comparative 
research on important questions about the 
dynamics of HABs within their oceanographic 
and ecological systems (GEOHAB 1998).  
Several international organizations, including 
IOC (Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission), PICES (North Pacific Marine 
Science Organization), APEC (Asian-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation) have set up programs or 
workshops on HABs.  To foster international 
cooperative research on HABs, it is important for 
marine and health scientists and agencies to 
document and understand HAB occurrences in 
each country in order to find common issues.  In 
this paper, we will give an overview of HAB 
history, causative HAB species, algal toxin 
distribution and poisoning events, and introduce 
HAB research activities and recent progress in 
HAB monitoring and mitigation in China. 
 
HAB occurrence in China 
 
The first documented HAB event in China, 
which was caused by Noctiluca scintillans and 
Skeletonema costatum in Zhejiang coast in 1933, 
killed marine organisms such as razor clams and 
other shellfish species.  This event was recorded 
by H. Fei (Fei 1952).  A summary of the early 
HABs in China is shown in Table 3.  The  
 
Chinese government and concerned scientists 
started to pay greater attention to HABs after the 
especially devastating Prorocentrum minimum 
bloom in the Bohai Sea, in August 1977.  This 
event covered an area of 560 km
2
 and lasted 20 
days, causing a mass mortality of fish, resulting 
in great losses to the local fishery (Hua 1989).   
With increased awareness of the issue and 
economic development along the coast of China, 
HAB numbers have increased dramatically each 
year.  Figure 12 shows coastal seas in China 
where HABs can occur.  Figure 13 demonstrates 
the increase in number of HAB occurrences 
during recent decades.  It is clear that HABs 
have been increasing rapidly along the Chinese 
coast since the 1970s, and that they occur more 
frequently along the south coast than along the 
north coast.  Thus, at least 322 documented HAB 
events have occurred from 1952-1998 in 
Mainland China.  An average of more than 10M 
RMB (1.2M US$) economic loss related to HAB 
occurrences has been suffered each year.  The 
main areas of HAB occurrences are the Bohai 
Sea, Changjiang Estuary and the South China 
Sea.  The HAB seasons are apparently delayed 
from the south to the north coast, which peak in 
March- May in the South China Sea, June-
August in the East China Sea, and July-
September in Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea. 
 
Table 4 lists 27 major and recent HAB events in 
China (event locations are also shown in Figure 
12).  These HAB events have resulted in great 
damage to local fisheries, the mariculture 
industry, and/or human health.  In each of three 
successive years from 1998, large HAB events 
on the scale of several thousand square 
kilometers, occurred in the Bohai Sea, East 
China Sea or South China Sea.  This increase in 
HAB frequency, scale and economic loss in 
China is drawing great attention from the 
government and the public.

As one of the areas of most frequent HAB 
occurrence, Hong Kong first began its reporting 
of HAB events in the early 1970s.  In 1983, Lam 
and Ho (1989) pointed out that the increasing 
frequency of HABs and related fish-killing 
events in Hong Kong were thought to be 
correlated with increased urbanization of that 
region.  From 1980-1997, 496 HAB events were 
recorded in Hong Kong waters (AFD 1997).  
According to the record, the area of most 
frequent HAB occurrence in Hong Kong was at 
Tolo Harbour (which experienced more than 
70% of the total HAB events), Mirs Bay and Port 
shelter (which are all located at north-east of 
Hong Kong).  In Hong Kong, 70% of the HABs 
occurred between December and May. 
 
In Taiwan, Alexandrium minutum has been a 
main causative HAB species.  Blooms of this 
species were first recorded in a crab culture pond 
in Pintoung County in November 1986.  Since 
the late 1980s, blooms of this species have 
caused mass mortality of cultured fish and grass 
prawn and PSP contamination of shellfish, as 
well as frequent intoxication of humans in 
Taiwan (Zhou 1999; Su et al. 1993).  The species 
was classified as Gonyaulax tamarensis, also 
known as A. tamarense in the early literature 
(Zhou 1999). 
 
Toxin distribution and poisoning events in 
China  
 
Several studies on PSP (Paralytic Shellfish 
Poisoning) toxins in shellfish and its causative 
organisms have been focused in Guangdong, 
Hong Kong, Taiwan, and in southern coast 
regions of China (Lam et al. 1989b; Lin et al. 
1994; Anderson et al. 1996;  Zhou 1999;  Jiang 
et al. 2000).  In Hong Kong, PSP toxins were 
first detected in shellfish samples in Tolo 
Harbour in 1985 (Lam et al. 1989b).  PSP toxins 
in marine products from Hong Kong showed two 
peaks with the main peak occurring in the spring 
and the other in fall (Chan and Young 1999).  
However, not until a recent investigation of PSP 
and DSP (Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning) toxins 
along the Chinese coast (sample sites are shown 
in Figure 12), was it found that these toxins were 
distributed widely along both the northern and 
southern coasts of China (Zhou et al. 1999).  
This investigation also indicated that DSP toxins 
were more frequently detected than PSP toxins.  
The frequency of occurrence and levels of PSP 
toxins along the southern coast  were higher than 
those along the northern coast.  In March 1990, 
extremely high PSP toxicity (>20,000 MU/kg) 
22
was detected in shellfish samples collected in Tai 
Tam Bay, southeast of Hong Kong, due to a 
bloom of A. catenella (Ho and Hodgkiss 1993).  
The highest level of DSP (10 µg/g) in China was 
found in blue mussel collected on October 2, 
1998, in Liaodong Bay (Juhua Island) during a 
bloom of Ceratium furca and Dinophysis fortii 
(Zhao 2000).  The distribution of PSP and DSP 
toxins along the Chinese coast is shown in  
Table 5.

Table 6 summarizes records of shellfish 
poisoning events in China, in which more than 
1,800 people were affected and 31 people died 
(Zhou, M. et al. 1999; Zhou, H. et al. 1999).  
Several illnesses are suspected to have been due 
to the consumption of DSP toxin-contaminated 
marine products in 1995 (Qian and Liang 1995).  
Ciguatera Fish Poisoning (CFP) is also a 
frequent algal toxin problem in the Hong Kong 
area.  More than 200 documented CFP poisoning 
events have occurred in Hong Kong since 1989, 
resulting in more than 1,000 people being 
intoxicated.  Although most of these CFP 
incidents were due to the consumption of 
imported coral reef fish, the causative HAB 
species Gambierdiscus toxicus has also been 
found recently in local waters (Lu and Hodgkiss 
1999).  Similar to Hong Kong, PSP and CFP 
toxins are the most frequently measured algal 
toxins in shellfish in Taiwan (Zhou, H. et al. 
1999).  A summary of PSP, DSP, CFP events, 
animal and plant mortalities over the past decade 
(1990-2000) appears in Appendix CH. 
 
Causative HAB organisms 
 
Table 7 summarizes 148 HAB species that have 
been found in China thus far, of which 44 have 
caused HAB events.  Among these 44 species, 
28 are known to be toxic (Qi et al. 1993; Zou 
1992; Zhu et al. 1997).  The most common 
species include Noctiluca scintillans, 
Prorocentrum minimum, P. mians, Alexandrium 
tamarense, Gonyaulax polyedra, Skeletonema 
costatum, Mesodinium rubrum, Trichodesmium 
sp., and Chattonella marina.  Twenty two 
species of dinoflagellate cysts have been found 
in samples collected from the East and South 
China Seas, including cysts from A. tamarense, 
Cochlodinium sp., Diplopelta parva, Gonyaulax 
grindleyi, G. spinifera, G. scrippsae, 
Gymnodinium calenatum, Gymnodinium sp., 
Lingulodinium polyedra, Pheopolykrikos 
hartmanii, Polykikos kofoidii, P. schwartzii, 
Protoperidinium americanum, P. cf. avellana, P. 
claudicans, P. conicum, P. conicoides, P. 
oblongum, P. subinerme, Pyrophacus steinü,  
Scrippsiella precaria and S. trochoidea (Qi et al. 
1996).  Table 7 shows that more dinoflagellates 
are distributed along the southern than the 
northern coast, while harmful diatoms are 
distributed evenly in both southern and northern 
coastal waters.  
 
At least 58 HAB species are found in Hong 
Kong. Here, the main HAB species are N. 
scintillans, S. costatum, G. polygramma, P. 
triestinum, P. minimum, C. furca, M. rubrum, G. 
splendens, P. sigmoidens, P. triquetra, and L. 
minimus (AFD 1997).  Hong Kong is also 
considered to be a vulnerable area for 
importation of foreign HAB species because it is 
such an internationally important marine 
transportation center.  Several species of 
dinoflagellate cysts were found in ballast waters 
arriving from Aukland and California (Zhang 
and Dickman 1999).
 
 
HAB research, management and 
collaboration in China 
 
HAB research in China covers the following 
areas: biology and taxonomy; nutrient dynamics 
and physio-ecological characteristics; life 
history; toxicity; dynamics of occurrence and 
disappearance processes; statistical models, and 
HAB prevention and treatment (Lin 1997; Zhang 
1994; Zhu and Li 1995).  About 30 projects on 
HAB and algal toxins have been sponsored by 
various national or local concerned government 
bodies in Mainland China since 1978.  It is clear 
that the efforts on HAB research by government 
agencies and concerned scientists are steadily 
increasing. 
 
A National Project of HAB in China called 
CEOHAB (Ecology and Oceanology of HAB in 
China), was approved in October 2001.  The 
project is called the “973 key project” and has 
funding of 28 MRMB (3.5 million US$) for the 
five years, beginning in April 2002.  Integrated 
and multidisciplinary biological, chemical and 
physical oceanographic research will be initiated 
in order to understand the mechanism of large-
scale HAB events in coastal areas, to provide 
scientific basis for “prevention, control and 
treatment of HABs”, and to allow the sustainable 
development of the marine economy in China.

In terms of HAB management, environmental

the State Oceanic Administration and Ministry of 
Agriculture and Fisheries in 1984 and 1990.  
 
A specific program for HAB monitoring along the 
Chinese coast, sponsored by the State Oceanic 
Administration, was initiated in 2001.  To address 
the issue of treatment and mitigation of HABs, a 
method using modified clay to coagulate HAB 
organisms has been developed.  Development of 
this process started in the early 1990s, and 
primarily involves:  coagulation of clays with 
HAB organisms, studies of clay surface 
modification and preparation methods;  kinetic 
studies of clay particles coagulating HAB 
organisms, and assessment of environmental 
impacts of clays on marine ecosystems (Yu et al. 
1998). 
 
Recently, a China Harmful Algal Bloom WebPage 
was set up at http://www.china-hab.ac.cn.  This C-
HAB WebPage contains various sub-areas 
including FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions), 
Occurrences, Species, Research, Coordination, 
Reporting and Links.  It is designed to provide 
basic knowledge to the public, to summarize the 
main HAB occurrences in China, to describe the 
main HAB species involved, to introduce research 
activities in China, and to provide links to related 
international web sites and projects.  Recent HAB 
occurrences in China will be reported in a timely 
manner via this web site.  The “C-HAB” WebPage 
has both Chinese and English versions. 
 
Chinese scientists are active in many collaborative 
international HAB programs, such as IOC 
(Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission) 
Harmful Algal Bloom Program and the APEC 
(Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation) Red 
Tide/Toxic Algae Management project.  In 
addition, the China SCOR (Scientific Committee 
on Oceanic Research)-IOC HAB workshop was 
convened in 1992.  China is also participating in 
programs such as GEOHAB (Global Ecology of 
Harmful Algal Blooms) and PICES Working 
Group 15 (Ecology of harmful algal blooms in the 
North Pacific).   
 
 
Discussion 
 
The seas around China cover a large area of about 
3,000,000 km
2
.  At the present time, however, 
Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan each 
utilize different systems for monitoring HABs.  
Therefore, in the greater China region, there are 
differences in monitoring methods and frequency 
as well as in defining HAB events.  Such 
variations might help to explain the big difference 
in reports of HAB frequency between Mainland 
China and Hong Kong, in which the number of 
HABs in Mainland China was 322 from 1952-
1998, whereas Hong Kong reported 496 HABs 
from 1980-1997.  During 1980-1998, 67 HAB 
events were reported from the South China Sea.  
Among them, 24 took place in both Guangdong 
and Hong Kong, including the serious “Hong 
Kong’98” (Hodgkiss et al. 2000).  Because Hong 
Kong shares much of the same coastline, e.g., Mirs 
Bay (Dapeng Bay), with Guangdong Province, and 
Taiwan likewise shares the Taiwan Strait with 
Fujian Province, it is crucial for all areas to 
coordinate their various regional HAB studies.  
This will allow scientists in the greater China 
region to better understand HAB mechanisms and 
to further develop and set up common and 
efficient HAB alarm systems.  It is heartening to 
see Hong Kong and Mainland China progressing 
so quickly toward cooperation in this area, through 
symposia and similar joint projects.  China also 
shares common sea areas with Korea, Japan, 
Vietnam, Philippines etc. Therefore, international 
coordination should be strengthened for better 
understanding of this oceanographic and 
ecological problem. 
 
For the future study of HABs, China will link its 
programs more closely with GEOHAB.  On the 
other hand, because China has the largest 
mariculture operation in the world, we recommend 
future research efforts on the relationship between 
mariculture activity and HAB occurrences in key 
coastal areas, in order to better foster and maintain 
the sustainable development of both mariculture 
operations and healthy marine ecosystems along 
the Chinese coast.

Harmful algal blooms (red tides):  Management and mitigation in the 
Republic of Korea

Introduction 
 
Most of the enclosed and semi-enclosed coastal 
waters of Korea are in a eutrophic state due to the 
increase of terrestrial and water-born pollutants.  
The effects of this coastal pollution and 
eutrophicaton have manifested themselves in three 
ways, namely as harmful dinoflagellate blooms; 
seasonal anoxia; and shellfish intoxication.  Of 
these, harmful algal blooms have recently become 
widespread and persistent, and the accompanying 
mass fish moralities are the most serious obstacles 
and risks for the sustainable development of 
coastal fisheries industries.  
 
Although there are historical records of red tides 
since the 6th century, the first scientific report on 
HABs in Korea was published in 1967 (Park and 
Kim 1967).  After then many scientific reports 
have been published (Cho 1978, 1979, 1981, 1986; 
Lee et al. 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983; Yoo 1982; Han 
et al. 1992; Kim et al. 1990, 1993a, 1993b; Park 
1980, 1982; Park et al. 1988; Lee et al. 1992).  
Since 1981, HABs have mainly occurred on the 
southern coast in Chinhae Bay and its vicinity.  
They became more widespread and persistent in 
1990s.   
 
 
As the blooms develop into a harmful phase, such 
as fish killing, there is an urgent need to monitor 
the outbreaks and to take appropriate measures for 
the mitigation of the fisheries damages, especially 
for aquaculture.  HABs will undoubtedly re-occur 
in the years to come due to abundant benthic cyst 
populations and eutrophic coastal water.  
However, it is very hard to accurately forecast the 
outbreaks of HABs and there are no effective 
countermeasures to mitigate the fisheries damages.  
We need to assess the present work on HABs in 
Korea and establish an efficient scientific agenda 
for research and mitigation strategies to allow 
sustainable coastal productivity. 
 
Overview of the spatio-temporal variations of 
HABs in southern Korean coastal waters 
 
In Figure 14, the number of red tide outbreaks 
since 1981 is shown.  One event is a bloom 
occurring in an area, caused by one or several 
species.  It is counted as new when the dominant 
species changes into other species, even if 
occuring at the same place.  Based on the annual 
total number of red tide outbreaks recorded in the 
HABs monitoring program, there were 8 events in 
1981, including 3 harmful dinoflagellate blooms,

as shown in Figure 14.  HABs increased in number 
to 21 in 1982, the first year of a Cochlodinium 
polykrikoides bloom, reaching 65 in 1995, the 
biggest and persistent year of C. polykrikoides in 
the last two and half decades.  In 1998, it increased 
to 122 outbreaks.  The number of C. polykrikoides 
blooms was 3 in 1982, and increased to 28 events 
in 1995.  The duration of blooms is generally less 
than one week but since 1984, they have continued 
sometimes for more than two weeks in enclosed or 
semi-enclosed bays.  These HABs were relatively 
restricted in geographical distribution in the 1970s.  
Until the early 1980s, the dinoflagellate blooms 
occurred mostly in some enclosed or semi-
enclosed bays, such as Chinhae and Kosong Bays 
in the South Sea.  But in recent years, they became 
widespread, extending to Kangnung in the East 
Sea, to Inchon and Mokpo bordering the Yellow 
Sea, and Yoja and Kosong Bays in the western 
part of the South Sea (Fig. 15).

Fig. 15 Spatial distribution of the red tide outbreaks in Korean coastal waters since 1981. 
Now the dinoflagellate blooms affect most of the 
coastal areas, in many cases over large geographic 
areas and caused by more than one harmful or 
toxic algal species (Kim et al. 1994).  
 
The prevailing phytoplankton groups responsible 
for the blooms are Dinophyceae and 
Bacillariophyceae as listed in Table 8.  Diatoms 
were the most common bloom species until the 
first half of the 1970s.  Since then, dinoflagellates 
such as Prorocentrum micans, P. minimum, 
Heterosigma akashiwo, Gymnodinium mikimotoi, 
G. sanguineum and Cochlodinium polykrikoides 
were found to be the major bloom formers.  They 
exclusively form monospecific blooms of high 
density in the summer season.  Some cyst-forming 
dinoflagellate species make blooms repeatedly at 
the same place and same time of the year (Kim et 
al. 1990).

Reviewing the annual fluctuations of HABs for the 
last two decades, four stages can be identified 
according to species toxicity, spatial distribution, 
density and duration as follows:  the first - before 
the 1980s, the second stage - from 1981 to 1988, 
the third - four years from 1989 to 1992, and the 
last - five years since 1993.   
 
As shown in Table 9, in the first stage the 
causative species were harmless, and the area was 
only partially affected by localized algal blooms.  
Bloom density was approximately 1,000 cells ml
-1
.  
The second stage, from 1981 to 1988, was a 
transition stage from harmless to harmful species.  
The blooms occurred either in partial areas or 
sometimes widespread and lasted one or less than 
two weeks.  From the third stage on, harmful 
species were chiefly responsible for the blooms, 
and they became widespread in whole coastal 
South Sea.  The density sometimes reached 10,000 
cells ml
-1
, quite lethal to aquatic animals.  The 
duration of algal blooms was less than 3 weeks 
until 1992, but in 1995, it continued for nearly two 
months.  From 1996 to 1998, the Cochlodinium 
bloom occurred every August and persisted for 
about one month.

Dynamic modeling of harmful Cochlodinium 
blooms 
 
After C. polykrikoides blooms caused severe 
economic loss in 1995, dynamic modeling has 
been used to study the initiation and subsequent 
development of the blooms.  From our recent 
work, it was found that C. polykrikoides species 
bloom when the thermocline is absent and water 
temperature overlying bottom sediment is 20 °C or 
more.  The population growth rate of C. 
polykrikoides is high at water temperatures of 24 - 
26°C.  It has proved that this species grows well in 
slightly eutrophic water similar to a chemical 
oxygen demand (COD) of 1 ppm.  Warm and 
slightly eutrophic environment, is optimal for the 
growth of C. polykrikoides, forms in the South Sea 
in late August or early September when eutrophic 
coastal water is mixed with warm offshore water. 
This warm water is the intrusion of the Tsushima 
Warm Current.  
 
When the C. polykrikoides bloom is fully 
developed, it gradually forms a plume-like patch 
and grows.  Bloom movement and distribution is 
dependent on the wind direction and tidal currents.  
The bloom approaches the coast during flood 
currents when SW winds prevail, and vice versa 
during neap currents with a NW wind.  
 
In order to build a virtual model for the initiation 
of C. polykrikoides blooms, we need to do in-
depth studies to assess the influence of nutrient 
and COD-related factors on the growth rate, 
precise dormant period of this species, and 
temperature sensitivity of excystment and 
population growth.  Furthermore, surface water 
temperature from NOAA images and chlorophyll-
α concentrations from SeaWiFS images are also 
studied to predict subsequent evolution and 
horizontal distribution.

HABs management and mitigation strategies  
 
The Korean fisheries economy depends heavily 
upon the coastal zone for marine products and so it 
is especially sensitive to constraints from HABs.  
Resources must be used in the most efficient way 
and there is a need for sustainable, multiple-use 
management schemes.  
 
There needs to be reasonable implementation and 
countermeasures to combat the environmental 
challenges such as those described above.  The 
best way to minimize the damages is to detect 
HAB outbreaks at the initial stages and then take 
urgent action.  The present action plan consists of 
regular monitoring and quick announcements to 
alert fishermen.  Recently, a HAB alarm system 
and shield curtain for fish cages have been 
invented and can be commercially acquired.  In 
addition, local self-government authorities 
sprinkle clay on the surface of the HAB-affected 
areas.  If fisheries damages arise due to HABs, the 
government grants subsidies and relief bank loans 
for the sufferers.  
 
Hierarchical and television monitoring and 
announcement 
 
It is very necessary to forecast the outbreaks of 
blooms in order to take appropriate measures.  
Some fish killing dinoflagellates can devastate the 
farms.  Most of the coastal fish farms cannot avoid 
the HABs due to fixed aquaculture facilities.  
 
Regular coastal monitoring has been carried out 
since 1981, biweekly or monthly at 70 stations 
from March to November by the National 
Fisheries Research and Development Institute 
(NFRDI) to investigate the status of water quality 
and HAB outbreaks. Most of the coastal 
environmental parameters are monitored 
simultaneously. 
 
When HABs occur, daily observations are made to 
indicate the subsequent development of HABs in 
the affected area and neighboring waters likely to 
be affected.  Another 24 watch teams patrol the 
coast every day to detect red tides from May to 
October.  There were 92 outposts along the coast 
in 1996.  The patrolling periodicity is dependent 
on the frequency of red tide outbreaks in the last 5 
years.  They are divided into 3 grades, i.e., daily, 
weekly and biweekly patrolling outposts.  The 
main target phytoplankton are C. polykrikoides, G. 
mikimotoi and Gyrodinium sp. 
 
With respect to the quick-detection and best-save 
measures, NFRDI is working to build a “remote 
televisual HAB monitoring network”.  This is an 
image highway network for the 
telecommunication of microscopic image between 
local terminal laboratories and the central institute 
in Pusan.  The expert in the central institute can 
identify phytoplankton species by 
telecommunicated microscopic image from the 
local laboratory.  This way we can overcome the 
shortage of identification experts and a limited 
budget because this framework connects all the 
laboratories and outposts. 
 
Most of the red tide information is distributed 
immediately to aquaculturists, fishermen and 
municipal administrative authorities by facsimile, 
internet (http://www.nfrdi.re.kr), and automated 
telephone response system that began service on  
May 6, 1996.   
 
For the monitoring of shellfish poisoning, 
toxicological tests are run for PSP and DSP using 
bioassays and HPLC, and ASP using HPLC.  The 
annual budget for the 1995 national red tide 
monitoring was about US$250,000 exclusive of 
the personnel expenses and instrument purchase.  
 
Red tide alert system and alarm facilities 
 
To get early attention from fishermen and 
aquaculturists, NFRDI deploys an alert system.  It 
consists of notification of “Red Tide Attention”, 
“Red Tide Alert” and “Lifting of the Warning”.  
The notices of attention and alert are issued when 
the density of C. polykrikoides exceed 300 cells/ml 
and 1,000 cells/ml, respectively.  To prevent the 
intake of HABs into the fish culture tanks, 
practical HAB alarm techniques were invented in 
1997.  The HAB farm alarm system consists of 
sensor and alarm apparatus.  The sensor can detect 
chlorophyll, temperature and turbidity.  When it 
detects the possible HAB chlorophyll, it gives an 
alarm by sound during the day and light at night or 
both simultaneously.  It is possible to stop the 
seawater supply into the tank automatically. 
43
Mitigation strategies and scattering clays 
 
Mitigation strategies include cage movement to 
the outside of the affected area, diminution of feed 
supply, and early harvesting if the bloom develops 
to fatal levels.  Another most important mitigation 
strategy is the scattering of clay.  Clay has a 
capability to scavenge particles and carry them to 
bottom sediments.  The removal efficiency of 
flocculent has been qualified in laboratory and 
field studies near TongYong fish farm using clay 
in September 1996.  The removal efficiency was 
up to 80% using clay concentrations of 10 g l
-1
.  
No big difference was found between the 
laboratory and field test.  In the field, dissolved 
inorganic nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand and 
chlorophyll- α concentration decreased slightly 
after dispersion.  However, scattering clays into 
coastal farms has some impact on marine animals, 
especially on abalone, with no large effects on 
flatfish.

Introduction  
 
The eastern coast of Russia is a vast zone in the 
northwestern Pacific Ocean that includes the Sea 
of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea.  
This coast covers more than 30 degrees of latitude 
and extends from the Arctic in the northern Bering 
Sea to the southern Kuriles and the Sea of Japan.  
The Far Eastern Seas have a similar relief structure 
with a shallow northern area and a depression in 
the southern region.  The hydrological conditions 
in this area are dominated by large-scale ocean 
circulation with local cyclonic dynamics.  The 
coastline is indented with numerous fjords, inlets, 
bays, islands and estuaries.  The eastern coast of 
Russia is an important cultural and economic zone 
with dependence on fishery resources.  It is an area 
that supports active fisheries and the culturing of 
fish and marine invertebrates (more than 80% of 
the total production in Russia).  Due to decreasing 
fish catches in international waters of the Pacific 
Ocean, a restructuring of the fisheries toward 
coastal fishing and mariculture has occurred.  Fish, 
algal and mollusc farms have been established.  
Their productivity is still rather low, but it is 
expected that in the near future the number of 
farms and their production will increase 2- or 3-
fold.  However, harmful algae blooms (HABs), a 
problem in many parts of the Pacific Ocean, 
threaten the productivity of fisheries in the Far 
Eastern Seas of Russia. 
 
History  
 
There are few historical records of HABs in the 
Far Eastern Seas of Russia (Fig. 16; Table 10).  
The first narrative of a red tide in this area is in the 
fictional book, Frigate Pallada by Goncharov 
(1857).  From the description, we suppose that this 
red tide was caused by Noctiluca.  Blooms of 
Noctiluca scintillans in Peter the Great Bay in the 
Sea of Japan were documented at the beginning of 
the 20th century (Ostroumov 1924; Tagatz 1933).  
Gail (1936) observed fatty iridescent patches and 
bands on the water’s surface during the summer of 
1928-1931, caused by a bloom of the green alga, 
Halosphaera viridis.  Korean fishermen associated 
these green algal blooms on the sea surface with 
herring concentrations, and these observations 
were corroborated not only in the Sea of Japan off 
the coast of Primorye but also in the Sea of 
Okhotsk off the coast of Sakhalin Island. 
 
A harmful bloom of the diatoms of the genus 
Chaetoceros, causing the mortality of 
zooplankton, was described by Kusmorskaya 
(1947) in the northern Sea of Japan.  Herring 
mortalities during a diatom bloom in this area 
were reported by Koon (1949).  A massive bloom 
of Noctiluca extended over the whole area of 
Nemuro Strait in Southern Kurills (between the 
islands of Hokkaido and Kunashir) in May 1948 
(Gail 1950).  During the 1950s-1960s, 
investigators studying the seasonal distribution of 
plankton in the Far Eastern Seas observed a 
massive spring bloom of diatoms Thalassiosira 
and Chaetoceros (Gail 1963;  Meshcheryakova 
1960;  Semina 1959).   
 
The earliest documented case of paralytic shellfish 
poisoning (PSP) on the eastern coast of Russia 
was in September 1945, when six crew members 
of the fishing fleet “Aleut” were poisoned and two 
of them died after eating mussels collected in 
Pavla Bay on the western coast of the Bering Sea.  
Lebedev (1968) describes this phenomenon:  “The 
fishing area between Cape Navarin and Cape 
Olyutorsky was quite empty at this time of the 
year, in contrast to preceding years.  No life was 
seen on the sea surface.  The entire visible surface 
of the near shore waters over several miles was 
covered with brown-red, equally-spaced stripes 
extending from north to south”.  A second PSP 
incident occurred in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatski in 
mid-August 1973 during a toxic red tide in 
Avachinskaya Guba Inlet (Kurenkov 1973, 1974).

Twelve people, mainly children, were poisoned to 
varying degrees after they ate a meal of boiled and 
baked mussels collected in Avachinskaya Bay 
(Kurenkov 1974);  two children died.  The 
presence of saxitoxin in mussels from 
Avachinskaya Guba Inlet was confirmed in the 
early 1980s by the Kamchatka Department of the 
Institute of Marine Biology (V. Sova, pers. 
comm.).  Later it was found that the 
dinoflagellate, Alexandrium tamarense, was the 
causative organism in this HAB (Konovalova 
1989). 
 
Results  
 
Harmful algal blooms in the Far Eastern Seas of 
Russia are poorly studied.  The distribution of 
HABs across wide areas of the Russian East coast 
are virtually unknown.  Continuous studies of 
harmful algae have been made only in some 
localities.  A map that shows the Russian coastal 
waters where (and during which years) harmful 
algae have been studied is divided into numbered 
sectors as follows:  sector I - Peter the Great Bay 
in the Sea of Japan, since 1969;  sectors II and III - 
the coastal waters of Sakhalin Island, since 1994;  
sector IV - planktonic surveys in the coastal waters 
of Kuril Islands during 1983-1987, sector V - 
planktonic monitoring in Avachinskaya Guba Inlet 
off the Pacific coast of Kamchatka during 1987-
1990, sectors VI, VII, VIII – a summer 1999 
survey of recent dinoflagellate cysts along the 
western coast of the Bering Sea (Fig. 17, see 
Appendix RU, Table 14b).  Figure 18 shows the 
frequency of major HAB events in the Far Eastern 
Seas of Russia between 1980 and 2000 (Appendix 
RU, Table 14c). 
 
Using improved methods of investigation such as 
bottle sampling, reverse filtration with nucleopore 
filters for concentration of living cells, electron 
microscopy, cyst study and other methods, we 
have found and described harmful algae 
previously unknown in this area.

These investigations have revealed that among 
almost 30 species causing blooms of water in the 
Far Eastern Seas, 24 species are known to be 
harmful  (Table 11, Fig. 19, for detailed electron 
micrographs, see Appendix RU, pp. 61-66). 
Among those species the great majority are 
planktonic algae belonging to 3 groups of 
phytoplankton: diatoms, dinoflagellates, and 
raphidophytes.   
 
Bloom-forming planktonic animals are represented 
by only one species, an infusorian Mesodinium 
rubrum.  This species has caused more than half of 
all the red tides in the northern part of the Pacific 
coast of Russia along the eastern coast of 
Kamchatka and at the northern Kuril Islands (Fig. 
18).  The first two red tides caused by M. rubrum 
were observed in Avachinskaya Guba Inlet:  one 
in September-October 1983, when water 
temperatures were 9-11
o
C, and the other between 
the end of November and the beginning of 
December 1984  (water temperature was about 
0
o
C).  The concentration of organisms from 3x10
5
- 
2x10
6 
cells/liter turned the water a cherry-red color 
(Orlova et al. 1985).  In the Sea of Japan, a red 
tide caused by this species was first recorded in 
August 1985, in Vostok Bay at water temperature 
of 21-22
o
C (Konovalova and Selina 1986).  
Persistent red tides caused by M. rubrum were 
repeatedly observed in August-September 1985, in 
Kraternaya Bay, Ushishir Island, Kuril Islands 
(Propp et al. 1989).  Planktonic monitoring in 
Avachinskaya Guba Inlet from 1987-1990 showed 
that red tides caused by M. rubrum were observed 
here nearly year-round with an interval at the 
beginning of summer. 
 
Diatoms 
 
Diatoms are the most common bloom-forming 
algae in the Far Eastern Seas of Russia.  More than 
20 species of diatoms can cause blooms in the 
study area (Table 11) and only some of them are 
known to be harmful.  Electron microscopy has 
revealed the presence of five potentially toxic 
species of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia.  Pseudo- 
nitzschia pungens and P. multiseries are the most 
common and widely distributed species in the

and pp. 63-66 for morphometric data of Pseudo-
nitzschia species; Orlova and Stonik 2001; Stonik 
et al. 2001).   
 
An extensive bloom of both Pseudo-nitzschia 
multiseries and P. pungens at 11 million cells l
-1
 
was first recorded in Amurskii Bay near 
Vladivostok in 1992 (Orlova et al. 1996).  A 
bloom of P. pungens (at numbers up to 2 million 
cells l
-1
) was observed in the coastal waters of 
Sakhalin Island in August 2000 (Fig. 18, Table 
12).  P. pseudodelicatissima, P. multistriata and P. 
delicatissima were found only in the coastal 
waters of the Sea of Japan.  The maximum 
abundance of hundreds of thousand cells per liter 
of those species was noted during late summer and 
autumn.   
 
 
Raphidophytes 
 
In the past 20 years the first raphidophyte blooms 
have been observed.  These microalgae are 
Chattonella globosa, C. marina, Heterosigma 
akashiwo, and Fibrocapsa japonica (Table 11).  
Heterosigma akashiwo is the most common of 
these raphidophytes found in the coastal waters of 
the Far Eastern Seas of Russia.  Short-lived 
outbreaks of H. akashiwo were recorded in 
Amurskii Bay near Vladivostok and in the coastal 
waters of Sakhalin Island (Table 12).  The 
distribution of species of the genus Chattonella in 
the Far Eastern Seas is restricted to the northern 
part of the Sea of Japan.  An extensive bloom of 
Chattonella sp., resulting in fish mortality, was 
first recorded in September 1987 in Amurskii Bay 
(Simakova et al. 1990; Shumilin et al. 1994) (Fig. 
18).  Chattonella globosa is abundant (hundreds of 
thousand cells per liter) in the summer-autumn 
period in Amurskii Bay (Table 12).

Dinoflagellates  
 
The greatest number of HABs in the Far Eastern 
Seas of Russia are caused by dinoflagellates, four 
of which provoke red tides.  Noctiluca scintillans 
is one of the most common species in the 
investigated area.  The distribution of this species 
is restricted to the southern part of the Pacific 
coast of Russia (Table 12).  In the past 20 years, it 
has caused most of the visible red tides recorded 
in this region.  An extensive Noctiluca scintillans 
red tide was observed in the spring-summer period 
in Peter the Great Bay in 1980, 1982, 1992, 1993, 
1994 and 1995 (Fig. 18).  The density of N. 
scintillans reached hundreds of thousand cells per 
liter, and the water surface was colored bright red-
orange (Vyshkvartsev et al. 1982;  Zhirmunsky 
and Konovalova 1982;  Ilychev et al. 1985). 
 
Dinoflagellates of the genus Alexandrium ( A. 
tamarense, A. acatenella, A. catenella, A. 
pseudogonyaulax and A. ostenfeldi) have been 
observed in the Far Eastern Seas of Russia (Table 
11, see Appendix RU, pp. 61-62 for electron 
micrographs of Alexandrium species).  A. 
tamarense is the most common of these species 
(Table 12).   
 
A red tide caused by A. tamarense and A. 
acatenella at one million cells per liter was 
recorded in Avachinskaya Inlet in Kamchatka in 
July and August of 1984.  An extensive A. 
tamarense red tide (with numbers up to 2 million 
cells per liter) was observed in Olyutorsky Bay in 
the Bering Sea in July 1986 when water 
temperatures ranged from 12-14
o 
C.  This bloom 
was accompanied by mortalities of cetaceans, fish 
and birds (Konovalova 1989).  In July 1988 and 
1990, a red tide of A. tamarense covered the entire 
coast of the Bering Sea, including the northeastern 
coast of Kamchatka and the estuarine zones.  This 
bloom was especially strong in Kronotsky and 
Avachinsky Bays and at Cape Lopatka in 
September 1990 (Konovalova 1989).  
 
Qualitative and semi-quantitative surveys of living 
dinoflagellate cysts have recently been made 
along the western coast of the Bering Sea.  
Sediments were collected from 15 stations in 
June-October 1999 (Table 13).  This is the first 
survey of recent dinoflagellate cysts on a Russian 
Pacific coast.  Twenty-four types of cysts were 
identified to species level, representing 8 genera:  
Alexandrium, Gonyaulax, Gyrodinium, 
Polykrikos, Pentapharsodinium, Preperidinium, 
Protoperidinium and Scrippsiella.  The most 
common cysts were those of Gonyaulax grindleyi, 
G. spinifera, Polykrikos schwartzii, 
Pentapharsodinium dalei, Protoperidinium 
americanum, P. conicoides, P. subinerme, 
53
Scrippsiella crystalina and S. trochoidea.  The 
cysts of the potentially toxic species A. tamarense 
were widely distributed and the dominant type in 
the study area.  The abundance of cysts of A. 
tamarense varied from 13 to 16,761 cysts ml
-1
.  
The greatest number of cysts at 25860 cysts ml
-1 
was registered at Station 8 in Pavla Bay (Fig. 20, 
region VI).

Five species of the genus Dinophysis were 
common and widely distributed in the Far Eastern 
Seas of Russia (Table 11, Fig. 19).  The 
abundance of these species have exceeded the 
reportedly harmful level of 200-500 cells per liter 
in the coastal waters of the Far Eastern Seas of 
Russia in the summer-autumn period (Table 12).  
Dinophysis acuminata is one of the most abundant 
species with numbers reaching thousands of cells 
per liter in Peter the Great Bay in summer.

During the past 20 years, new species of Karenia 
have been observed in the Far Eastern Seas of 
Russia.  Karenia brevis (synonym Gymnodinium 
breve) has been found in low numbers in the 
coastal waters of the Sea of Japan and Sakhalin 
Island (Table 12).  Short-term outbreaks of K. 
mikimotoi (synonym G. mikimotoi) at one million 
cells per liter were recorded in Amursky Bay in 
September and October of 1987, 1989 and 1990 
(Selina et al. 1992;  Fig. 18).  
 
Conclusion 
 
There is a great disparity in the amount of 
information about HABs available for the Far 
Eastern Seas of Russia.  The most complete record 
of numbers and seasonal dynamics of harmful 
algae, as well as HAB events can be found for the 
coastal waters of Primorye and Kamchatka rather 
than for other areas on the Russian east coast.  
Some regions still remain blank spots on the HAB 
map.  
 
Long-term observations in the northern Sea of 
Japan and planktonic surveys on the coasts of the 
Sea of Okhotsk, the Bering Sea, and the Pacific 
coast of Kamhatka, show that there has been an 
apparent increase in the frequency, intensity and 
geographical distribution of HABs in Russian 
coastal waters during the last two decades.  
Routine phytoplankton monitoring in Peter the 
Great Bay (Sea of Japan) has revealed that a peak 
of HAB activity occurred between the end of the 
1980s and the beginning of the 1990s. 
 
In this area, the appearance and massive blooms 
of new species of raphidophytes and naked 
dinoflagellates were observed during this period.  
It is obvious that the distribution of those 
microalgae is widespread.  The most serious 
problem in identification is that fixed cells are 
generally indistinguishable.  The decrease in the 
apparent intensity of HABs in the mid-and late-
1990s does not suggest that any positive changes 
in the coastal ecosystem have occurred.  Every 
year we have observed recurrent blooms of 
nontoxic species (Skeletonema, Chaetoceros, 
Thalassionema and others) at millions of cells per 
liter in the hypereutrophic coastal waters during 
the summer and autumn periods.  The majority of 
harmful species that are known in this area can 
produce cysts (hypnozygotes in Alexandrium spp.) 
and resting cells  (Pseudo-nitzschia spp.).  
Transport of resting cells or cysts by currents or 
ballast waters may bring new species to new 
locations where they remain dormant until 
conditions are right for germination.  Most of the 
blooms of harmful species have occurred in 
coastal waters subjected to the most powerful 
anthropogenic influence.  In our opinion, complex 
factors that provide the most favorable conditions 
for outbreaks of harmful algae exist in those areas.  
The major factors are high levels of mineral and 
dissolved organic substances, as well as the 
vertical stability of the water layers, associated 
with the substantial freshening and warming of the 
surface waters during the summer period.   
 
In this report, we have reviewed the available data 
pertaining to harmful algae on the coasts of the 
Russian Far East.  The information reviewed here 
indicates that in the last two decades there has 
been an apparent increase in the frequency, 
intensity and distribution of harmful algal blooms 
in Russian coastal waters.  The algae that cause the 
most concern are the genera Alexandrium, Pseudo-
nitzschia and Dinophysis, known for their 
toxigenicity and ability to cause paralytic, amnesic 
and diarrhetic shellfish poisonings.

Recommendations for the future 
 
The Russian Federation lags far behind other 
PICES member countries in its approach to the 
research and management of problems caused by 
harmful algae and marine biotoxins.  The Russian 
Federation, in contrast to other PICES member 
countries, does not have a federal HAB monitoring 
program.  It only has small, fragmented research 
programs carried out by individual investigators, 
with small budgets, and often without any 
financial support.  We recommend establishing a 
permanent federal program of HAB monitoring in 
the Russian coastal waters.  The primary goal of 
this program would be to understand the 
geographical location and frequency of HAB 
events in order to protect the human consumers 
from intoxication and to prevent losses in the 
aquaculture industry due to harmful algal blooms.  
 
Several of the most important questions for future 
research in Russia include:  
• what is the composition and distribution of 
harmful algae in the coastal waters of Sakhalin 
Island and South Kuril Island? 
• what is the composition and distribution of 
dinoflagellate cysts in recent marine sediments 
in coastal waters of the Sea of Okhotsk? 
• what is the distribution of Alexandrium 
tamerense in the Far Eastern Seas of Russia 
(cyst occurrences, morphology and genetic 
analysis of populations, toxin analysis)?

Abstract 
Harmful algae monitoring was carried out during 
May-October of 2000-2001, on the east coast of 
Russia both in Primorye and Sakhalin Island.  
Over the period of study, 13 species known to be 
harmful were found.  These microalgae were the 
diatoms Pseudo-nitzschia pungens, P. multistriata 
and Thalassiosira mala; the dinoflagellates 
Alexandrium acatenella, A. catenella, A. 
pseudogonyaulax, A. tamarense, Dinophysis 
acuminata, D.  acuta, D. fortii, D. norvegica and 
raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo and 
Chattonella  globosa.  Brief outbreaks of Pseudo-
nitzschia pungens (1.5x10
6
 cells l
-1
) were observed 
in the near-shore zone near Vladivostok.  A bloom 
of Heterosigma akashiwo (5x10
6
 cells l
-1
) was 
recorded in coastal waters of Sakhalin Island.  
Toxins have not yet been measured in shellfish on 
the east coast of Russia, but the causative 
organisms are common.  Cases of human 
poisoning were not recorded.  
 
Materials and methods 
 
Harmful algae monitoring was carried out during 
May-October of 2000-2001 in 3 study areas:  (I) in 
the coastal waters of Primorye in the Sea of Japan, 
(II) on the southeastern coast of Sakhalin Island, 
and (III) on the northeastern coast of Sakhalin 
Island. Samples were collected 1-2 times per 
month using a 4-liter Molchanov’s bathometer 
from the surface horizon (0.05 m) and near 
bottom.  The material was fixed in Lugol’s iodine 
solution and concentrated using a traditional 
method of precipitation.  The cells were counted in 
Najott chamber with a volume of 0.05 ml;  large or 
rare species were registered in a chamber with a 1 
ml volume.  
 
 
Results 
 
During these studies 13 species that are known to 
be harmful were found in the Far Eastern Seas of 
Russia (Table 14a).  They belong to 3 groups of 
phytoplankton: diatoms (2 species), dinoflagellates 
(8) and raphidophytes (2).  
 
 Diatoms  
 
Pseudo-nitzschia pungens is one of the most widely 
distributed species in the study area. The blooms of  
P. pungens at 1.5 millions cells l
-1
 were recorded 
both in May and August 2000, near Vladivostok 
(Fig. 21).  Pseudo-nitzschia pungens was common 
in the coastal waters of Sakhalin Island in August 
2000 at 2.1x10
5
 cells l
-1
.  P. multistriata was found 
in the coastal waters of Sakhalin in September 2001, 
at 1x10
4
 cells l
-1
.  
 
Raphidophytes 
 
Chattonella globosa was common in the coastal 
waters of Primorye in August 2000, at number 
5x10
5
 cells l
-1
.  An extensive bloom of 
Heterosigma akashiwo was recorded in August, 
2000 in the coastal waters of Sakhalin Island (Fig. 
21).

Dinoflagellates   
 
Dinoflagellates of the genus Alexandrium  
(A. tamarense, A. acatenella, A. catenella and A. 
pseudogonuaulax) were observed in the Far 
Eastern Seas of Russia (Fig. 21).  Alexandrium 
tamarense was the most common species. It was 
abundant in coastal waters of Sakhalin Island, at  
4x10
4
 cells l
-1
. 
 
Dinophysis species are widely distributed in the 
Far Eastern Sea of Russia but no Dinophysis 
blooms were observed.  The abundance of these 
species exceeded the reportedly harmful level of 
200-500 cells l
-1
 in the coastal waters in the 
summer-autumn period.  Dinophysis acuminata is 
one of the most abundant species.  Its number 
reached thousands of cells per liter in the coastal 
waters of Vladivostok in August 2000. 
 
Major HAB events in each sector of the Far 
Eastern Seas of Russia are summarized in Table 
14b.  The frequency of HAB events in 2000-2001 
is shown in Figure 22.

Harmful algal blooms in western Canadian coastal waters

Introduction 
 
British Columbia (B.C.), the Pacific province of 
Canada, has one of the longest documented 
histories of the severest form of harmful algal 
blooms, paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), along 
its entire 27,000 km coastline.  The first 
documented case was in 1793 when four of Capt. 
George Vancouver’s survey crew became ill after 
a meal of mussels while charting the central coast 
(Mussel Inlet, originally named Mussel Canal, a 
side-arm of Mathieson Channel; see Fig. 23).  The 
location where they had the toxic breakfast of 
mussels was named Poison Cove by Vancouver.  
One of them died five and a half hours later and 
the location of his burial was named Carter’s Bay.  
Their symptoms, described in detail by Vancouver 
(1798, quoted by Quayle 1969), are unmistakably 
characteristic of PSP.  Earlier illnesses from the 
consumption of mussels in Europe differ in detail 
from classic PSP, most notably in the struggle to 
breath before the cessation of respiration.  In PSP 
breathing stops gradually without struggle (Taylor 
1992).  In 1799, only a few years after the Capt. 
Vancouver incident, a major poisoning episode 
with many fatalities involving Aleut Indians 
working with Alexander Baranoff in the Russian-
American sea-otter fur trade occurred in nearby 
southern Alaska (detailed by Trainer, this volume).  
 
Ever since monitoring of shellfish for the presence 
of toxins began in 1942, following a severe 
outbreak with fatalities in B.C. and adjacent 
Washington State, PSP has been recorded 
primarily in filter-feeding shellfish on the coast 
(Quayle 1969).  These include mussels, various 
species of clams, oysters, geoducks and scallops 
(Anderson 1960; Quayle 1969).  PSP toxins and 
domoic acid have been found in the guts of 
Dungeness crabs (Wekell et al. 1994). 
 
Since 1965, when one of the authors began to 
focus on HABs on the B.C. coast (Prakash and 
Taylor 1965), most other forms of HABs, or the  
species known to produce them (Taylor et al. 
1994), have been recorded from B.C., including 
domoic acid poisoning (also known as amnesic 
shellfish poisoning or APS) and fish kills.  Further 
summaries have been provided by Taylor (1994) 
and Taylor and Horner (1994), the latter limited to 
the Strait of Georgia and its tributary inlets.  The 
present report provides a summary of current 
knowledge of HABs in western Canada.  
 
Shellfish poisoning 
 
This is the potentially fatal poisoning of humans 
by the consumption of shellfish that have 
accumulated toxins from their phytoplankton diet. 
It exists in several forms, some of which are 
known from British Columbia. 
 
Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) 
 
This phenomenon, caused by the concentration of 
saxitoxin and its derivatives by shellfish consumed 
by humans, is severe and chronic on the B.C. 
coast.  Since monitoring began in the late 1940s, 
there has not been a year in which toxicity has not 
occurred and virtually everywhere on the coast has 
been toxic at one time or another.  Some areas are 
toxic every year.  The worst single fatality episode 
recorded in B.C. was in May 1942, in which three 
native Indians died in Ucluelet and Bamfield, on 
either side of Barkley Sound on the west coast of 
Vancouver Island, and three near Port Angeles 
close by in Washington State (details are provided 
in an appendix by Quayle 1969).  Since records 
were first officially kept (1942) and a monitoring 
program established, there has not been a single 
year in which shellfish did not become toxic, the 
years differing only in the extent and duration of 
the closures (a complete summary of data from 
1942-1965 was provided by Quayle and Bernard 
1966).  Further fatalities occurred in 1965 
(Theodosia Inlet; details in Prakash and Taylor 
1965 and Quayle 1969) and in 1980 at Health 
Harbour on Gilford Island (southern Queen 
77
Charlotte Sound).  Illnesses and near-fatalities are 
common (Fig. 23). 
 
Although it did not result in fatalities, there was a 
particularly severe incident in the Comox area on 
eastern Vancouver Island in 1957, with 61 human 
illnesses and seven domestic cat fatalities. 
Although mussels and clams were involved, the 
majority became ill after eating oysters.  At this 
time, toxin levels reaching 19,840 Mouse Units 
(MU, roughly equivalent to 3200 µg per 100g) 
were measured (for details see Quayle 1969).  A 
severe, potentially fatal incident, summarized by 
Taylor (1992), occurred in Kingcome Inlet (on the 
mainland not far from Gilford Island) in 1992, 
when two individuals were poisoned sufficiently

to cause rapid death (one stopped breathing twenty 
minutes after consuming less than one butter 
clam).  Although there is no antidote to saxitoxin 
they were both saved by continuous artificial 
respiration.  Recovery was complete after several 
days on respirators in hospital.  This is the first 
known case in which the importance of artificial 
respiration in saving severely poisoned individuals 
was demonstrated. 
 
An interesting feature of PSP occurrence on the 
B.C. coast is that it frequently occurs earliest in 
this part of the coast (Fisheries statistical areas 12 
and 13), as early as April or May, whereas it 
usually appears in June in the Strait of Georgia 
and later off the west coast of Vancouver Island.  
Most recently (1999-2001) the closures in 
southern B.C. were extensive and persisted in 
some areas of Vancouver Island until November 
(Canadian Food Inspection Agency reports).  
Because butter clams (Saxidomus giganteus) retain 
toxin in their black siphon tips potentially for more 
than a year (Quayle 1969), and because the current 
monitoring program relies on mussel toxicity, 
butter clams are now permanently prohibited from 
collection along the entire coast.  Other shellfish 
that become potentially fatal to humans include 
mussels, other clams, scallops, oysters, moonsnails 
and geoducks.  The guts of crustaceans such as 
barnacles, Dungeness crabs and sand crabs 
(Emerita analoga) have been found to contain 
PSP, as well as ASP (see below). 
 
Schallié (2001) has discussed the philosophy, 
nature and limitations of the current B.C. shellfish 
monitoring program.  The locations of monitoring 
sites for PSP toxins in shellfish (during 1999) are 
shown in Figure 24.  The north coast can be 
subject to prolonged toxicity but is logistically 
very difficult to monitor effectively and has been 
permanently closed since 1964 to the collection of 
bivalves except at a few monitoring sites (see 
Purkis 2001; Purkis in Martin 2002).  Some data 
from the north coast suggests that it differs from 
the south in that high levels of toxin can persist in 
winter (Gaines end Taylor 1985).  Anecdotal 
information from local inhabitants (Taylor, 
unpubl.) suggests otherwise, with avoidance of 
shellfish consumption confined to the summer 
months.

The link to species of the dinoflagellate, genus 
Alexandrium (formerly attributed to the genera 
Gonyaulax and Protogonyaulax; see illustrations 
of some of the species elsewhere in this report) in 
British Columbia, was made unequivocally by 
Prakash and Taylor (1966): the Theodosia Inlet 
episode was the first recorded instance anywhere 
in which human fatality was coincident, not only 
with toxic shellfish, but also with a bloom of toxic 
Alexandrium (A. acatenella). 
 
Usually when poisoning occurs the bloom has 
already passed. A. catenella also occurs in B.C., 
where it is the chief source of PSP off the west 
coast and eastern Vancouver Island.  In more 
estuarine waters, such as the east side of the Strait 
of Georgia, A. tamarense is the dominant taxon 
(Taylor 1984, see Figure 25).  A. minutum, also 
known to be toxic, is present in English Bay near 
Vancouver although a bloom of it has not been 
recorded so far (Taylor, unpubl.), as well as 
several non-toxic species of Alexandrium, such as 
A. pseudogoniaulax and A. hiranoi.  A. ostenfeldii 
is present in English Bay, Vancouver (Haigh end 
Taylor, unpubl.), but not in bloom quantities.  
Canadian east coast populations of the latter have 
been shown to produce spirolides causing rapid 
death in mice, but spirolides have not been 
demonstrated in B.C. shellfish. 
79

Alexandrium and intermediate forms in the Strait

Ecology of PSP species in B.C. 
 
Alexandrium blooms have been observed 
repeatedly in several studies in B.C. waters 
although there has not been a large-scale effort 
focused specifically on their outbreaks.  In English 
Bay, multi-year sampling at Jericho Pier (Haigh 
and Taylor 1993) has shown that blooms first 
appear subsurface (1-3 m) in May or June, 
coincident with surface Heterosigma blooms, and 
persist throughout the summer months. 
 
The blooms are initiated from benthic cysts, as is 
well known elsewhere, but studies have shown 
that there is no simple spatial correlation with cyst 
density in sediments.  In B.C., blooms seem to 
originate in shallow, nearshore localities and 
spread into adjacent, larger bodies of water, e.g., 
in Barkley Sound where cells are first seen in the 
inner northern corner (Taylor et al. 1994).  In 
Barkley Sound, cells appear at depth sooner than 
indicated by intertidal toxicity values, with the 
blooms rising nearer to the surface as the season 
progresses. 
 
Although PSP is present every year, there are clear 
oscillations in intensity (Fig. 26).  There is a 
problem comparing years with widespread, 
medium-level toxicity, to years with isolated 
intense toxicity, and Chiang (1985) created a “PSP 
activity scale” formula in an attempt to make these 
comparisons.  Using a simpler method, Gaines and 
Taylor (1985) found a cyclical periodicity that 
seemed to be roughly five to seven years. Often 
these years have been El Niño years (Erickson end 
Nishitani 1985) but the recent high toxicity around 
Vancouver Island, reaching more than 9000 µg per 
100 g of shellfish in Barkley Sound, in October 
2000 (K. Schallie, pers. comm.), was during an 
inter-year.  Prolonged calm, sunny weather late in 
the season may have contributed to prolongation 
of Alexandrium blooms past the summer. 
 
There appears to be no link to pollution (Taylor 
and Horner 1994), because Alexandrium species 
usually occurring subsurface during the growing 
season (Taylor and Haigh 1994).  They are thus 
able to take nutrients from below.  PSP is worst in 
many of the least inhabited parts of the coast. 
There is no positive correlation of PSP with 
aquaculture activities in B.C. judging by a 
detailed, multiyear study in Sechelt Inlet (Taylor et 
al. 1994).  Blooms are not apparent in surface 
waters, at least in early stages of bloom 
development. They often occur in dense layers 
close to the nutricline.  In Barkley Sound, Taylor 
and Haigh (1994) observed that A. catenella was 
present at depth long before toxicity was recorded 
in intertidal shellfish.  
 
An interesting anomaly in the PSP data is the 
unusually early appearance of toxicity in the inlets 
and around the islands at the southern end of 
Queen Charlotte Strait, extending through to the 
northern Strait of Georgia.  This is also where 
several of the fatalities or serious illnesses have 
occurred, e.g., Gilford Island, Kingcome Inlet, 
Theodosia Inlet (see Fig. 23).

intensity is much higher in the south, which probably skews the picture. 
 
 
Domoic acid poisoning ( DAP or Amnesic 
shellfish poisoning, ASP) 
 
Domoic acid production has been linked to blooms 
of several species of the diatom genus 
Pseudo-nitzschia, notably P. multiseries, P. 
australis and P. pseudodelicatissima.  The toxin is 
retained the longest by razor clams but also occurs 
in mussels, used in the B.C. monitoring program 
(K. Schallie, pers. comm.) and in Dungeness crab 
guts.  Cooking of the latter whole causes the toxin 
to spread into the flesh. 
 
Pseudo-nitzschia spp. are present and often 
abundant in all B.C. marine water bodies 
throughout the summer and fall, e.g., Sechelt Inlet  
 
(Taylor et al. 1994) but the biggest blooms seem 
to occur over the outer continental shelf (Forbes 
and Denman 1991; see Fig. 25).  Taylor and Haigh 
(1996) observed that blooms enter Barkley Sound 
from the open coast and appear to sink out.  Taylor 
(2001) has suggested that this may be necessary 
for the sexual cycle since Pseudo-nitzschia like 
other pennate diatoms, requires direct contact of 
compatible cells and movement is only possible on 
a hard surface. 
 
There is a provocative timing series along the west 
coast of North America in terms of the first 
appearance of domoic acid toxicity, with that in 
British Columbia appearing later than further 
south.  So far, southern outbreaks have invariably

preceded those further north in B.C. and Alaska.  
This provides forewarning, allowing increased 
vigilance and raises interesting questions 
regarding possible advection (Taylor and Haigh 
1996) or a seasonal wave of altered environmental 
conditions (discussed in Summary and 
conclusions).  
 
Other potential shellfish toxin producers 
 
Species of the dinoflagellate genus Dinophysis 
have been linked to diarrheic shellfish poisoning 
(DSP).  In particular D. fortii, D, acuta. D. 
acuminata and D. norvegica, all of which have 
been linked to DSP elsewhere are common, but 
never abundant. 
 
However, it has been claimed that prolonged 
presence in concentrations of thousands per litre or 
less may cause levels sufficient to cause illness.  
No DSP has been diagnosed in humans in B.C. 
but, given its resemblance to diarrhea caused by 
bacterial contamination (Vibrio haemolyticus in 
particular), would DSP be detected without testing 
specifically for okadaic acid or dinophysistoxin?  
Prorocentrum lima, a known okadaic acid 
producer, has been recorded as common in benthic 
environments (sand) in B.C. (Taylor, unpubl.) but 
local strains have not been tested for toxin 
production. 
 
Most recently the common temperate 
dinoflagellate species Protoceratium reticulatum,  
 
82
also known as Gonyaulax grindleyi, has been 
shown to reproduce yessotoxins which have 
contaminated shellfish in New Zealand.  This 
species is very common and occasionally abundant 
in British Columbia coastal waters (its benthic cyst 
stage is the commonest dinoflagellates cyst in B.C. 
coastal sediments (Dobell, Ph.D. thesis, UBC)) but 
no illnesses have been linked to this species in this 
region so far. It should be noted that yessotoxins 
are not part of the standard monitoring program.  
Like the potential DSP producers, local culture 
isolates need to be made for toxin testing.  This is 
also true for potential spirolide production by A. 
ostenfeldii. 
 
A disturbing development was the discovery of 
microcystins in samples of fouling on farmed 
salmon pens in the Strait of Georgia (Andersen, 
Kent, Taylor REF.).  Microcystins are tumor 
promoters so far known only to be produced by 
fresh-water cyanobacteria. Their presence in sea 
samples in B.C. is a mystery at present. 
 
Fish killers 
 
In general wild fish are not harmed by HABs in 
B.C.  This is probably due to the high tidal 
exchange preventing the hyper-bloom 
concentration and subsequent plankton death and 
decay which causes mass mortalities elsewhere.  
Also, there is possibly behavioural adaptation, 
such as avoidance by swimming around or under 
surface blooms, arising from long-term exposure 
(thousands of years or more) to the same HABs 
that occur now.  On the other hand, farmed fish are 
more vulnerable to such blooms because they are 
kept in pens in the ocean where they cannot avoid 
the noxious plankton concentrations.  The loss to 
salmon aquaculture in B.C. between 1986 and 
1990 was estimated to be CDN$ 15 million (Black 
1990). 
 
Chaetoceros concavicomis, Ch. convolutus 
 
Bell (1961) first showed that spines of the 
common, chain-forming diatom Ch. convolutus 
(probably including the closely similar Ch. 
concavicornis) could lethally damage the gills of 
ling-cod held in cages near Nanaimo.  Relatively 
low concentrations of cells (5000 l
-1
) of these two  
 
diatom species, particularly Ch. concavicornis, can 
also kill farmed salmon by physically damaging 
their gills.  Small spines on their setae cause them 
to irreversibly penetrate the gill tissue and cause 
capillary damage.  This also makes the fish more 
vulnerable to Vibrio infections.  Quite often the 
fish produce large quantities of mucus in their 
gills.  The diatoms are most abundant in the 
summer and fall in the Strait of Georgia (Haigh 
and Taylor 1990) and coastal inlets (Taylor et al. 
1994) in waters above 25‰ for Ch. convolutus 
and 17‰ for Ch. concavicornis (Albright et al. 
1992, Harrison et al. 1993). 
 
Heterosigma akashiwo (= H. carterae) 
 
This small species of chloromonad (raphidophyte) 
flagellate has been the principal killer of farmed 
salmon in British Columbia since 1986.  Blooms 
can be extremely extensive in B.C. coastal waters 
(Taylor end Haigh 1993).  
 
In 1989, the entire Strait of Georgia was covered 
by the reddish brown of a bloom of this organism 
(E. Black and F. Taylor, unpubl.obs.).  The precise 
mechanism of death is uncertain although the 
organism is presumed to release harmful 
substances into the water which cause gill and/or 
liver damage in salmon. Black et al. (1991) could 
not observe gill damage in fish killed in their 
experiments.  Excessive gill mucus production is 
sometimes also observed with Heterosigma 
blooms, but not always.  
 
Regular, multi-year monitoring of bloom 
development in English Bay, Vancouver (Taylor 
and Haigh 1993), has shown that cells abruptly 
appear in the water when the temperature reaches 
15°C (usually in June), apparently due to 
excystment from shallow sediments.  Blooms are 
most extensive in the Strait of Georgia during 
summers with strong, shallow stratification due to 
high runoff from the Fraser River, in turn resulting 
from a higher than normal snow-pack the previous 
winter.  A drop in salinity in English Bay to 15‰ 
coincides with 15°C in severe bloom years in this 
area.  A prerequisite to strong blooms is that the 
spring diatom bloom must be over (usually by late 
May) and the surface water depleted of nitrate. 
 
 
83
Cochlodinium sp. 
 
In the summer of 1999 a series of salmon kills at 
farms on the west coast of Vancouver Island was 
linked to a bloom of the naked dinoflagellate 
Cochlodinium sp. (Whyte et al. 2001).  The cells 
resembled C. polykrikoides, the major fish killer of 
Korea and in Japan (see this report) but showed 
less chain formation, usually occurring in pairs or 
singly.  The initial outbreak was estimated to 
cause losses of approximately CDN$ 2 million.  
This phenomenon has recurred less severely in 
subsequent years with a suggestion of southward 
spread along the coast of Vancouver Island.  The 
cause of death is unknown although a similar 
mechanism to that in Korea and Japan (oxygen 
radical production leading to gill, and perhaps also 
liver damage) is suspected. 
 
Others 
 
Visible discolourations due to blooms of many 
other species of phytoplankton are common in 
B.C. waters during spring and summer (reviewed 
for the Strait of Georgia by Harrison et al. 1983).  
There is a regular spring bloom of diatoms, 
primarily consisting of Thalassiosira 
nordenskioldii, Skeletonema costatum and several 
species of Chaetoceros, notably Ch. debilis.  This 
is often followed by the heterotrophic 
dinoflagellate Noctiluca scintillans which 
regularly blooms intensely enough to strongly 
discolour the water an orange-red (see cover 
photograph).  In these waters it is usually not 
harmful.  Esquimalt Lagoon near Victoria on 
Vancouver Island is frequently intensely 
discoloured by late summer blooms of Akashiwo 
sanguinea (formerly Gymnodinium sanguineum) 
which is also not harmful unless trapped in a 
decaying state.  Watanabe and Robinson (1979) 
studied an intense bloom of it in September-
October 1978. 
 
Another very common discolouration is caused by 
intense, maroon, surface blooms of the 
photosynthetic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum, which 
aggregates particularly at downwelling fronts or in 
internal waves in the Strait of Georgia (reviewed 
by Taylor et al. 1971).  It has been invariably 
harmless although it can cause a red discolouration 
in shellfish.  AVHRR imagery has detected large 
reflective blooms off B.C., particularly off the 
coasts of Vancouver Island and the Queen 
Charlotte Islands (Gower 1997).  These are 
probably caused by harmless coccolithophorids 
but this has not been properly “ground-truthed” 
yet.  We do not include such harmless blooms in 
our HAB data. 
 
In 1990, a particularly extensive and intense 
bloom of the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax spinifera 
was implicated by Heath and Lindsay (1993) in 
the mass mortality of shellfish such as oysters, 
clams and mussels in tributary inlets to Barkley 
Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island.  
This non-specific mortality was attributed to 
oxygen depletion accompanying collapse of the 
bloom.  Usually blooms are not as concentrated as 
this in local areas due to strong tidal exchange.  
Such non-specific kills due to high B.O.D. are 
known from other parts of the world where other 
species of Gonyaulax and also Ceratium, have 
caused fish and shellfish kills without the 
involvement of toxin release. 
 
In Japan, the commonest fish killers are species of 
the chloromonad genera Chattonella and 
Fibrocapsa.  A few cells of an unidentifiable 
species of Chattonella have been seen in preserved 
samples from open west coast waters (Taylor, 
unpubl. obs.) but never a bloom.  Sea temperatures 
on the B.C. coast are generally colder than areas 
commonly subject to Chattonella blooms, such as 
the Inland Sea of Japan.  This is also true of the 
fish- killing dinoflagellate Pfiesteria. 
 
Discussion 
 
Given that reports have been increasing and new 
species implicated in HABs in B.C. and on many 
coastlines, it is reasonable to wonder if this is due 
to human activities, such as eutrophication.  
Taylor et al. (1994) and Taylor and Horner (1994) 
concluded that there was no evidence for links 
between HABs and salmon aquaculture in B.C. 
waters.  The sites usually chosen for salmon 
farming are deep and the large tidal range flushes 
the surface waters well.  Many of the highest PSP 
sites are along very lightly populated coasts.  On 
the other hand there is evidence of cyclical 
interannual variation that is presumably due to 
interannual climatic variation.  In the case of 
84
Heterosigma there is a clear link to snow pack 
accumulation the previous winter and subsequent 
runoff.  Also, Taylor (in press) has argued that the 
natural adaptation of local fauna, such as the 
avoidance of toxic shellfish by sea otters or 
Heterosigma blooms by Pacific salmon, is strong 
evidence for the presence of particular HABs over 
evolutionary time. 
 
Another question is whether some local HAB 
species have been introduced by, for example, the 
discharge of foreign ballast water.  Again, Taylor 
(in press) has drawn attention to the general 
biogeographic phenomenon of “latitudinal 
cosmopolitanism” exhibited by groups such as 
dinoflagellates (Taylor 1987). 
 
Management at present consists of monitoring 
shellfish, primarily mussels, for the presence of 
saxitoxins and domoic acid, by the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency, Fish Inspection Branch, with 
closures declared when levels reach or exceed  
80 µg saxitoxin equivalents per 100 grams of 
shellfish meat.  This program is aided in collection 
and sample preparation for toxin testing by the 
North Coast Water Quality and Biotoxin Program, 
a private agency based in Prince Rupert (see 
Purkis in Martin 2002).  While the use of mussels 
as indicators of the presence of toxins is 
favourable for a variety of reasons (see Schallié 
2001) including their rapid uptake abilities relative 
to other shellfish, their rapid depuration abilities 
make them unreliable as indicators of the state of 
shellfish in general.  As noted above, butter clams 
retain saxitoxins for longer and oysters only 
accumulate PSP slowly, requiring longer exposure 
to reach dangerous levels.  In the case of domoic 
acid it is known that razor clams retain the toxin 
the longest.  At present plankton monitoring is not 
part of the Food Inspection Agency activities 
although it could be a valuable adjunct to shellfish 
testing, as shown on the east coast, e.g., Prince 
Edward Island and New Brunswick.  A consortium 
of fish farmers, aided by staff of the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans at the Pacific Biological 
Station in the Nanaimo, participate in a Harmful 
Algae Monitoring Program (HAMP) that does 
include plankton sampling from farm sites, 
resulting in warnings of potentially fish-killing 
blooms.  However, because it is restricted to near-
shore sites, it is of limited ecological value. Some 
plankton monitoring is also being done at a few 
northern sites near Prince Rupert by the North 
coast plankton identification and monitoring 
program (Shaw 2001). 
 
It is clear that the siting of aquaculture sites in 
particular should require a prior investigation of 
the broad aspects of the phytoplankton community 
of the area.  So far this has not been the case, often 
to the cost of the farmers.  Much remains to be 
done, both to understand and effectively manage 
HABs in British Columbia and this will be most 
effective if it is integrated with the confluent 
waters of its neighbours, Washington State and 
Alaska. 
Specific questions needing near-future 
examination 
 
• What is the causal nature of the multi-year 
(six- to eight-year) cycles on the coast?  Is 
there a direct link between El Niño (ENSO) 
and higher levels of PSP? 
• Are Alexandrium blooms in B.C. coastal 
waters all locally triggered events or is long-
shore transport also important? 
• What is the source of extensive blooms visible 
by satellite off the east coast of the Queen 
Charlotte Islands and in Queen Charlotte 
Strait? 
• Why is the southern Queen Charlotte Strait 
region (Gilford Island, Kingcome Inlet, 
Johnstone Strait area) the earliest in southern 
B.C. to experience high PSP toxicity? 
• Is PSP more persistent in the winter months in 
the north than the south? 
• How many toxin-producing species and strains 
of Alexandrium and Pseudo-nitzschia are there 
in B.C. waters? 
• Is there a hydrographic link between off-shore 
blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia along the west 
coast of North America? 
• Are Cochlodinium and Heterosigma blooms

Introduction and historical background 
 
In the U.S, the two major toxic syndromes caused 
by harmful algal blooms (HABs) that are found 
along the entire west coast are paralytic shellfish 
poisoning (PSP) and domoic acid poisoning 
(DAP), also known as amnesic shellfish poisoning 
(ASP).  Certain species of phytoplankton from the 
genus Pseudo-nitzschia, and the genus 
Alexandrium are concentrated by filter-feeding 
shellfish and finfish which when consumed by 
humans, marine mammals, or birds can result in 
ASP and PSP, respectively.  Specifically in the 
subtropical region of Hawaii, ciguatera fish 
poisoning (CFP) is also known to be a problem, 
caused a nerve poison, ciguatoxin, produced by 
the dinoflagellate, Gambierdiscus toxicus.  Other 
harmful species, including the raphidophyte, 
Heterosigma akashiwo, and the diatoms from the 
genus Chaetoceros, kill fish at aquaculture sites, 
but are not known to be harmful to humans.  
Water discolorations (red tides) caused by noxious 
phytoplankton, such as Noctiluca scintillans and 
Ceratium spp., also occur throughout the area and 
are noted to be nuisance species but are not 
included in this summary.  This report will focus 
on those algae that produce toxins known to be 
harmful to humans. 
 
The earliest recorded PSP event on the U.S. west 
coast occurred in 1799, and was documented by 
Aleksander Baranov, the chief manager of the 
Russian-American trading company.  A party of 
Aleut hunters under his command paddled to a 
place called Khutznov Strait, later to be called 
Peril Strait, where the Natives collected and ate 
some small, black mussels that were abundant in 
the area.  Two minutes later about half the party 
experienced nausea and dryness of the throat.  
Two hours later, about a hundred Aleut Indian 
hunters had died.  Some survived by eating a 
mixture of gunpowder, tobacco, and spirits to 
induce vomiting. 
 
Each U.S. west coast state, including Alaska, 
Washington, Oregon, California, and Hawaii have 
different monitoring programs for HABs that are 
described in the sections that follow.  Each state 
has a contact person and/or public hotline number 
for the most current toxin test results (Table 15).  
In each state, the mouse bioassay is the standard 
test for PSP toxins approved by the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration.  The test procedure uses 
extracts of toxins from 100 grams of tissue.  This 
extract is injected into 3 mice 18-23 grams in 
weight.  The amount of time required for the mice 
to die is recorded then converted to micrograms 
(µg) of toxin per 100 g.  The regulatory limit for 
safe harvest of shellfish and crab, set by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration, is 80 µg toxin per 
100 g shellfish tissue.  The analytical technique 
used for domoic acid testing is high performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC), which measures 
levels of toxin in a sample by comparison to a 
known quantity of purified standard.  The 
regulatory limit for safe harvest of shellfish is  
20 ppm (part per million) domoic acid and for 
Dungeness crab viscera is 30 ppm.

Because the U.S. west coast covers such an 
expansive area with different toxic species, ranges 
in toxin levels, and economic impacts due to 
HABs, each of the states will be considered 
separately in this report.

Testing 
 
The immense coastal area of Alaska makes PSP 
testing impossible in all regions where shellfish 
and crabs can be harvested.  Therefore, testing for 
PSP and ASP is done only in areas of commercial 
operations.  When recreational harvesting is 
permitted in a given area, it is because there is also 
a commercial operation in the vicinity.  Because 
such a small area of coastline is monitored relative 
to areas where shellfish can be found, at least one 
human illness is documented each year.  This is 
due, in part, to the rich Native American cultural 
tradition of eating shellfish for subsistence in 
Alaska.  At times it may be difficult for Native 
Americans and other people living in remote areas 
to resist the temptation of harvesting shellfish 
from non-certified areas.  An epidemiological 
study estimated that Alaskan natives are ten times 
more likely to contract PSP than the average 
resident of Kodiak, a population frequently 
exposed to PSP toxins (Gnessner and Schloss 
1996). 
 
In Alaska between 1973 and 1994, 143 people 
were believed to have become sick due to PSP.  
During 1995-2000, at least 51 people became ill.  
Due to under-reporting of illnesses, or 
misdiagnosis, the number of people suffering from 
PSP in Alaska is likely to be 10-30 times higher 
than reported.  Annually, most of the illnesses 
occur in May and June (Fig. 28).  Among the 61 
outbreaks where the shellfish species was known, 
most involved the ingestion of butter clams 
(Saxidomus giganteus) and mussels (Mytilus 
edulis or M. californianus).  Cockles 
(Clinocardium nuttalli), razor clams (Siliqua 
patula), and littleneck clams (Protothaca 
staminea) were also eaten and caused some of the 
illnesses.  It is interesting that most outbreaks of 
PSP occurred on Kodiak Island, the southern edge 
of the eastern half of the Aleutian Islands and 
Southeastern Alaska.  No outbreaks of PSP have 
yet resulted from shellfish collected from Cook 
Inlet.  The most common symptoms of PSP were 
paresthesis (tingling on skin), lip numbness and 
tingling, nausea and numbness of extremities 
(RaLonde 1996).  In Alaska, shellfish (oysters, 
mussels or clams), crab (king crab, Dungeness 
crab, Tanner crab, Hair crab), and sea snails 
(Fusitriton orgegonensis) are tested for PSP. 
 
Alaska’s current bivalve shellfish fishery consists 
of the native littleneck clam, razor clam and 
geoduck clam.  A PSP sampling plan for 
commercially or aquaculturally-produced 
shellfish, crabs, and snails is implemented by the 
Alaska Department of Environmental 
Conservation (ADEC) from its single testing 
laboratory located in Palmer, 60 km north of 
Anchorage.  There is no agency responsible to 
monitor beaches for recreational or subsistence 
harvests.  The ADEC regulations require strict 
compliance with a tiered program that decreases 
sampling requirements after set time periods of 
PSP-free samples.  Not only do the shellfish and 
aquaculture operations pay for the collection and 
shipping of samples, a dry, temperature-controlled 
holding facility is required for storage of the 
harvest out of water until the laboratory tests are 
completed.  Consequently, PSP not only causes 
direct economic impact during toxic events, but 
the coast of shipping, testing, and storing 
commercially-harvested shellfish also increases 
the cost of doing business.  Domoic acid testing is 
done only for the one commercial razor clam 
operation on the east side of Cook Inlet.  Because 
of this testing, a recreational razor clam fishery on 
Cook Inlet is allowed.

Seasonality 
 
The highest PSP levels in all shellfish species 
tested are shown in Figures 29 and 30.  There has 
been some recent documentation of PSP in Alaska 
where no prior occurrences have been seen. 
 
The seasonality of PSP in Alaska is dependent on 
shellfish species and location.  However, the 
earliest incidence of PSP in March-May of each 
year is generally in the Juneau area (SE Alaska).  
Human illnesses have also been documented in 
this area more frequently than when monitoring 
began.  High PSP levels are measured farther 
north (north of the Aleutian chain) later in the 
spring and early summer.  Shellfish south of the 
Aleutian chain often have high toxin levels 
whereas areas north of the chain are often toxin 
free.  Generally, all areas have lower levels of PSP 
in the spring (Fig. 31, example from 2000), while 
summer and early winter are times when high 
levels of PSP are generally observed.  However, 
some exceptions exist.  In Steamboat Bay (SE 
Alaska) and Grabina Island (outside Ketchikan), 
geoducks are toxic all year.  In Simons Bay 
(outside Sitka), an area that is generally free of 
PSP, there was one peak level of PSP in January 
1996 (240 µg/100g).  The highest level of PSP 
ever measured in Alaska was 20,606 µg in blue 
mussels at Kamisan Bay, Kodiak Island on May 
27, 1997 (Fig. 29).   
91
PSP has been measured recently in oysters in SE 
Alaska where there had been no problem.  There is 
limited testing for ASP in Alaska and levels have 
been near the detection limit since 1991.  The 
highest was 11 ppm in blue mussel in Cook Inlet. 
 
Causative organisms 
 
Three species of Alexandrium occur in Alaska 
(Scholin and Anderson 1994).  A. catenella 
(Whedon and Kofoid) Balech occurs in estuarine 
and open coast environments from southern 
California to southeast Alaska, forms chains and 
blooms when the water temperature is about 20
o
C.  
A. tamarense (Lebour) Balech, prefers cooler 
temperatures and less saline waters than A. 
catenella.  It has been found in the Gulf of Alaska 
(RaLonde 1996).  A. fundyense Balech has been 
found at Porpoise Is., Alaska.  These are the 
primary species believed to cause PSP in Alaska. 
 
Pseudo-nitzschia species occur from at least Point 
Barrow (R. Horner, pers. comm, documented by 
Bursa 1963 as Nitzschia seriata) and probably 
throughout the Bering Sea (listed as Nitzschia spp. 
section Pseudonitzschia from shelf-break stations 
near Unimak Pass by Schandelmeier and 
Alexander 1981).  Pseudo-nitzschia spp. probably 
occur throughout the Gulf of Alaska (records from 
American Mail Line ships of opportunity cruises 
between Seattle and Yokohama in 1968-1972).  
Pseudo-nitzschia are also known to occur in Port 
Valdez since the early 1970s (Horner et al. 1973).  
However, all of the earlier records are of N. 
seriata, which is possibly identified correctly to 
the species level for the farthest north samples, but 
is probably not identified correctly for all of the 
Gulf of Alaska and for Southeast Alaska. 
 
Economic impacts 
 
Alaska has the largest, most productive fishery 
(shellfish and fish) in the U.S., contributing 54% 
to the total U.S. landings.  The cost of PSP to the 
commercial fishery, recreational harvest, and 
aquaculture surpasses $10 million annually 
(RaLonde 1996).  The economic consequences of 
PSP in Alaska have drastically affected the 
development of a clam fishery, where an estimated 
50 million pounds are available for harvest (U.S. 
Department of Interior 1968).  In 1917, five 
million pounds of shellfish were harvested from 
Alaskan waters, but today the state’s commercial 
bivalve industry is virtually nonexistent.  The 
value of the sustainable, but presently unexploited, 
shellfish resource in Alaska is estimated to be $50 
million per year (Neve and Reichardt 1984).  An 
example of the impacts of PSP to a specific fishery 
is realized in the reduced value of the geoduck 
fishery.  In 2000, the geoduck fishery was 
receiving $1.60 per pound for processed geoduck 
that needed evisceration.  The price for whole 
geoduck, in contrast, was $7.00 per pound.  
Because of the uncertainties of PSP levels in this 
commercial shellfish, most of the harvested 
geoduck needed to be sold as eviscerated product.  
In 1998, the value of the geoduck fishery was $1.2 
million.  Because processing was required, 
however, the actual value of the final product was 
about $500,000, resulting in a loss of revenue of 
almost $800,000. 
 
The potential problem of PSP and the associated 
testing requirements are major factors preventing 
development of a surf clam (Spisula polynyma) 
harvest in the Bering Sea.  The sustainable harvest 
of the Bering Sea surf clam is estimated at about 
29,000 metric tons with an annual worth of about 
$9 million (Hughes et al. 1977).  The harvest of 
other clam species that are affected by PSP and net 
worth of these fisheries is shown in Table 16.

and ASP on Alaskan fisheries can be viewed at

Washington State 
 
Human illness due to PSP has been a problem in 
Washington State.  In May 1942, a severe 
outbreak of PSP near the northwestern 
Washington town of Sekiu, resulted in the death of 
two Elwha Indian children and one adult male.  At 
the same time, there were numerous reports of 
dead cats, dogs and chickens that had been feeding 
on the clam waste from the outer coast of 
Washington State.  In late August 2000, an 
outbreak of PSP in mussels from South Puget 
Sound, at levels of 13,769 µg/100 g, resulted in 
the illness of nine people.  These were recreational 
harvesters who had collected and consumed blue 
mussels within a closed area.  Five were 
hospitalized and three of the five were placed on 
artificial respiration.  Two required artificial 
respiration for about 1 week.  One came very close 
to death, even with medical intervention. 
 
Testing 
 
The Washington State Department of Health 
(WDOH), in cooperation with the George 
Williams Hooper Foundation for Medical 
Research at the University of California in San 
Francisco, began a shellfish toxicity surveillance 
program in the early 1930s.  In 1942, the WDOH 
and the Washington Department of Fisheries 
(WDF) imposed a closure from April 1 until 
October 31, for the recreational harvest of all 
bivalve mollusks along the northern and western 
Washington coastline.  In June 1957, PSP 
monitoring was re-established to include all 
species of commercially harvestede shellfish in 
North Puget Sound and the outer coast, after 
WDOH was advised of the prevalence of PSP in 
British Columbia shellfish.  Only minimal 
monitoring of recreational shellfish harvesting 
areas was conducted until 1971.  Recreational 
shellfish harvesting opportunities have been 
severely restricted since the mid-1970s because of 
more frequent occurrences of PSP and higher 
levels of measured toxin (Taylor and Horner 
1994).  Recently, closures due to PSP toxins in 
shellfish in Puget Sound are widespread, as seen in 
the data for the year 2000 (Fig. 32). 
 
Fig. 32 Locations where closures due to PSP 
(red circles) occurred in 2000 due to levels of 
toxin in shellfish at or above 80 µg/100g.  Low 
levels (below 80 µg/100 g) are also shown as 
smaller blue circles. 
 
Selected representative commercial shellfish 
operations must submit samples for PSP testing on 
a biweekly basis during winter and spring, and as 
often as weekly during summer and fall.  Selected 
recreational areas are sampled weekly from April 
through October by state and county health 
departments, with sampling often done by 
volunteers, including the Puget Sound Restoration 
Fund program.  Since 1989, WDOH has used 
caged blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) as an early 
warming system for PSP.  Mussel cages are 
located at over 70 sites, most of which are 
monitored biweekly throughout the year.  
 
Mussels are also routinely used by WDOH to test 
for domoic acid, but clams and oysters from 
commercial sites are also used.  In addition, the 
Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife 
(WDFW), formerly the Washington Departmnt of 
Fisheries and coastal Tribes (including the 
Quinault, Quileute, and Hoh tribes) collect razor 
clams in a number of management areas along the 
open coast, and these are analyzed by both WDOH 
and the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, 
Northwest Fisheries Science Center as part of the 
Olympic Region Harmful Algal Bloom (ORHAB) 
project (see below).  
 
 
 
93
Retention time of domoic acid in razor clams is 
extremely long, and the record levels of toxin, 
approaching 300 ppm in October 1998, took until 
the fall of 1999 to depurate to below the regulatory 
level. 
 
A routine phytoplankton monitoring program 
(ORHAB) was established in Washington State in 
2000, with a primary focus on the coastal Pseudo-
nitzschia species that produce the domoic acid 
toxin.  This 5-year project, funded by NOAA’s 
National Ocean Service, is a collaboration among 
federal, state (including Indian tribes), local, and 
private agencies to determine which physical, 
biological, and chemical factors promote and 
sustain HABs on the Washington coast.  One of 
the findings of this project allowed the level of 
domoic acid in razor clams to reach 20 ppm (from 
15 ppm), resulting in increased openings on 
coastal beaches since the fall of 2001. 
 
Deaths of finfish reared in net pens in Puget Sound 
have been caused by members of the diatom genus 
Chaetoceros at least since 1961 (Bell 1961).  
Fishes exposed to Chaetoceros show massive 
discharge of gill mucus, causing lamellar 
degeneration and separation.  The biological 
impacts of this organism as well as those algae 
that discolor seawater (Noctiluca scintillans) and 
organisms causing some damage to oyster larvae 
(Ceratium fusus) and spot prawns (Akashiwo 
sanguinea, reported as Gymnodinium sanguineum) 
through unknown mechanisms are problems but  
are not discussed in detail here. 
 
A species that deserves special note because of the 
great economic distress it has caused to fish 
farming operations is Heterosigma akashiwo (also 
called H. carterae or sometimes erroneously, 
Olisthodiscus luteus).  Although there were early 
reports of a fish kill near Lummi Island in Puget 
Sound in 1976, and another in central Puget Sound 
(Manchester) that were attributed to Heterosigma, 
the first confirmed fish kill due to Heterosigma 
was in 1986.  In that year, a bloom covering  
>7000 km
2
 caused $4 million losses to aquaculture 
operations in Washington (Horner et al. 1991).  In 
1990, a bloom in central Puget Sound killed about 
1.3 million fish valued at $4-5 million (Horner et 
al. 1991).   
The exact mechanism of Heterosigma toxicity 
remains unknown, however there are theories that 
superoxide radicals or calcium channel agonists 
are involved. 
 
Seasonality and trends 
 
Recently, levels of PSP in geoduck have been 
above the regulatory standard in many areas of 
Puget Sound throughout the year.  The highest 
levels of PSP toxins in blue mussels and other 
shellfish are measured in August through October 
as seen in this example from 2000 (Fig. 33).  
August and September are usually the months with 
highest PSP levels in all shellfish monitored.  At 
times butter clams are the only species that are 
toxic in a given area, requiring species-specific 
closures for butter clams while harvesting all other 
shellfish is permitted.

Highest toxin levels 
 
The highest level of PSP ever recorded in 
Washington State was 30,360 µg/100g in blue 
mussels in September 1978 in an unusual event in 
the Whidby Basin, central Puget Sound (Fig. 34).  
The highest level of domoic acid measuring  
297 ppm in razor clams was recorded in October 
1998, on the central Washington coast.  
Widespread closures of the commercial, 
recreational and subsistence (tribal) harvests 
exceeded one year due to the slow depuration of 
razor clams. 
 
The first occurrences of PSP in Washington State 
were documented in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  
Monitoring by WDOH has shown that both 
Sequim Bay and Discovery Bay in northern Puget 
Sound have the longest recorded history of PSP in 
the state.  PSP levels in these areas were first 
measured in the 1950s.  PSP was absent from 
South Puget Sound until 1988.  The first closure 
there occurred in Carr Inlet when PSP levels in 
oysters reached 2000 µg/100g.  Since that time, 
yearly PSP closures have occurred in this southern 
area, possibly indicating that the spread of 
Alexandrium cysts has occurred over several 
decades to “seed” most of the Puget Sound region.  
PSP toxins can therefore be expected to occur in 
shellfish throughout most of Puget Sound in future 
years.   
 
To date, levels of domoic acid above the 
regulatory limit in shellfish have only occurred on 
the outer coast of Washington.  This is the only 
area in Washington State where razor clams are 
found.  It is likely that because domoic acid is not 
retained for long periods of time by shellfish other 
than razor clams, ASP has not been a problem in 
Puget Sound.  However, because the ingestion of 
mussels containing domoic acid caused human 
deaths in eastern Canada in 1987 (Bates et al. 
1989), vigilant monitoring of this toxin is required 
in Washington State.  October and November 
appear to be the months when domoic acid is most 
likely to be measured in razor clams on the coast, 
however, in 2000 and 2001, levels of domoic acid 
slightly above the regulatory limit were measured 
at select coastal beaches in March (ORHAB 
project, unpublished results). 
 
 
 
Fig. 34 Highest PSP and ASP toxin levels 
measured in Washington, Oregon and California. 
 
Causative species 
 
The primary species of Alexandrium responsible 
for PSP in Washington State is A. catenella.  
Potentially toxic Pseudo-nitzschia species found in 
Washington coastal waters are P. australis, P. 
multiseries, P. pseudodelicatissima, P. 
fraudulenta, P. delicatissima, and P. pungens.  
Since 1998, it is believed that P. 
pseudodelicatissima accounts for the largest 
toxigenic coastal blooms with P. australis 
contributing only occasionally to low level razor 
clam toxicity on the beaches on the south coast. 
 
Impacts 
 
The outbreak of domoic acid on the Washington 
and Oregon coasts in 1991 is estimated to have 
cost $23-28 million to the commercial and 
recreational razor clam fishery (Nosho 1999).  
Dungeness crab harvesters also lost at least $9 
million during this episode.  In all, the state’s 
shellfish processors experienced a 50% decline in 
sales.  Razor clam harvesting days lost due to  
 
95
domoic acid and paralytic shellfish toxins from 
1991-2000 are summarized in Table 17.  During 
these toxic episodes, coastal oyster farmers also 
suffered economic losses although there was no 
evidence that oysters had accumulated any toxin.  
Oyster farmers lost around $2.17 million in sales 
in 1991, because of the public’s fears about eating 
toxin-tainted product.  In 1998, when record levels 
of domoic acid were detected in Oregon and 
Washington razor clams, the coastal tourism 
industry alone experienced an estimated $15 
million loss (Nosho 1999).  Repeated closures 
have reduced tourist visits to the Washington coast 
during the razor clam harvesting season and have 
resulted in loss of product confidence in the 
shellfish consumer. 
 
In November 1997, a late season bloom of 
Alexandrium cause toxin accumulation in oysters 
in bays on Washington’s outer coast.  Revenue 
losses to oyster farmers due to the harvest closures 
approached $7 million after only 2-3 weeks.  In 
South Puget Sound, where closures were in effect 
for 2 months that same year, shellfish farmers lost 
a total of about $2 million (Nosho 1999).  
 
In 1996, WDOH began monitoring PSP toxins in 
the gut of geoduck.  The agency was informed that 
Asian and tribal communities were eating the 
stomach in soups, pâtés, and other recipes.  During 
that same year, various Indian tribes began 
commercially harvesting geoduck in several areas 
of Puget Sound, therefore the careful testing of all 
tissues consumed was essential.  The testing of 
geoduck gut resulted in six product recalls that 
resulted in loss of sales to companies and a 
reduction in price by many markets.  During 1996, 
11 geoduck tracts were closed due to PSP.  Since 
that time, levels of PSP toxins in geoduck viscera 
in a given tract vary substantially from one week 
to another.  The lack of PSP toxin predictability in 
geoduck has resulted in managers calling this the 
“light switch phenomenon” (Cox 2001) in which 
toxin levels rise and fall rapidly. 
 
In 1989, H. akashiwo was responsible for the loss 
of $4 million worth of pen-reared salmon.  Since 
then, substantial economic losses from these 
blooms have occurred (Table 18).  H. akashiwo 
has been linked to mortalities of salmon in the 
wild.

Oregon 
 
The geography of the Oregon coast differs from its 
more northerly neighbors as there are no inland 
waterways or fjords which must be monitored for 
HAB toxins.  There are 350 miles of mostly 
accessible coastline with sandy beaches, rocky 
intertidal shoreline, long stretches of dunes, and 20 
estuaries of varying sizes.  Tillamook, Netarts, 
Yaquina, and Coos are larger bays with 
commercial shellfish production, mainly cultured 
oysters.  Native oysters are scarce in Oregon and 
their harvest is prohibited. 
 
Testing 
 
The State of Oregon has tested shellfish for PSP 
since the late 1950s.  One death in Oregon in 1958 
was linked to PSP.  At present, the Food Safety 
Division of the Oregon Department of Agriculture 
monitors up to 30 sites for PSP and domoic acid.   
Shellfish collected from each site can include 
razor clams, mussels, oysters, and bay clams 
including: gaper (Tresus capax), cockle 
(Clinocardium nuttali), littleneck (Prototheca 
staminea), butter (Saxidomus giganteus), and 
softshell (Mya arenaria). 
 
The majority of recreational razor clam harvest 
(90-95%) occurs in northern Oregon from 
Tillamook Head to the Columbia River (Clatsop 
Beach).  The Oregon Department of Fish and 
Wildlife assists with collection of shellfish used 
for testing.

Clatsop Beach is the only area where commercial 
digging is allowed.  The number of harvesters 
varies with the abundance of razor clams.  Fewer 
than five harvesters dive for wild clams in 
Nehalem, Tillamook, and Coos Bays.  In the past, 
a small number of commercial mussel farming 
operations were located in central to southern 
Oregon, however all have discontinued business or 
changed to oyster farming.  There are 
approximately 15 commercial oyster growers in 
Tillamook, Netarts, Yaquina, Winchester 
(Umpqua River), and Coos Bays.   
 
Site monitoring occurs weekly in the summer and 
bi-monthly in the winter.  Mussels hung under 
piers at the mouth of bays are the preferred sample 
specimens, because they can, theoretically, be 
collected independently of tidal fluctuations and 
weather.  However, rough waves and vandals have 
taken the mussel “hangings”, so that often the wild 
mussels must be used.  These wild mussels are 
collected from rocks on extended jetties.  Mussels 
are placed at the mouths of commercial bays as 
sentinels for determining the safety of shellfish 
inside the bays.  The exception to this procedure is 
at Netarts and Winchester bays where oysters are 
monitored directly due to the proximity of these 
bays to the ocean.  When toxin levels are on the 
rise, samples from the commercial areas are also 
tested.  Program policy is to consider opening 
beaches for shellfish harvest after two consecutive 
sampling periods showing a strong declining trend  
in toxin below 20 ppm domoic acid and  
80 µg/100 g PSP. 
 
Seasonality 
 
The seasonality of coastal domoic acid events in 
Oregon is very similar to that observed in 
Washington State.  Typically, domoic acid 
poisoning has occurred in October and November, 
but events are occasionally documented in the 
spring.  For example, in April and May 2001, a 
domoic acid event closed Oregon beaches to razor 
clam harvest.  In October 1998, record levels of 
domoic acid reached 308 ppm in razor clams, 
resulting in closure of most beaches in Oregon for 
over 1 year.  This event also impacted the 
Washington coast. 
 
In August 1992, there was a record PSP event that 
closed razor clam harvests in northern Oregon for 
two years (1992-1994 at Clatsop beach on the 
north coast).  Over the past seven years, the 
Tillamook Bay commercial oyster harvest has 
been closed once due to PSP.  During that same 
97
period, the cockle harvest was closed at least three 
times due to high levels of PSP.  Domoic acid 
toxicity was responsible for a one year razor clam 
closure (1991-1992) on northern Oregon beaches.  
There were also significant PSP events in 1958, 
1973, 1977, and 1982. 
 
A geographical difference in HAB occurrences in 
the northern and southern Oregon beaches has 
been observed over the past few years.  For 
example, in 2001, PSP affected the southern 
beaches during the entire summer, whereas the 
northern beaches were not affected.  In that same 
year, domoic acid poisoning affected razor clams 
on the northern beaches, but was not a problem in 
the southern beaches.  The 1992 PSP event 
mentioned above affected the north and central 
coasts, but not the south coast.  Clearly, different 
oceanographic processes must be influencing the 
distribution of HAB species on Oregon’s southern 
and northern beaches. 
 
Highest toxin levels 
 
The highest level of domoic acid was measured in 
October 1998 at 308 ppm in razor clam at Clatsop 
Spit, near the Columbia River in northern Oregon.  
The highest PSP level (>4367 µg/100 g) was 
measured in mussels from the south jetty of the 
Columbia River in late September 1992 (Clatsop 
Beach, Fig. 34). 
 
Causative species 
 
The causative species of PSP in Oregon is A. 
catenella.  Detailed studies of Pseudo-nitzschia 
species present at the time of high domoic acid on 
the Oregon coast have not been done.  However, a 
research cruise in the summer of 1998, prior to the 
toxic bloom that fall, measured high numbers of 
toxic P. australis in Oregon coastal waters 
(Trainer et al. 2001).  Additionally P. australis, P. 
fraudulenta, P. heimii, P. multiseries, P. pungens, 
and P. pseudodelicatissima have all been reported 
from Oregon (Fryxell et al. 1997). 
 
Impacts 
 
The razor clam industry in both Washington and 
Oregon has been affected by domoic acid 
poisoning in recent years, most notably in 1991 
and 1998.  The economic impacts of these events 
were discussed in detail in the Washington State 
report (above).  The effects of domoic acid 
poisoning on human health in this area is 
unknown.  
 
Relying on commercial harvesters to provide 
specimens to monitor for PSP becomes difficult 
when commercial harvests are closed.  There have 
also been some years when the abundance of razor 
clam “set” on the beach was quite low, making 
sampling difficult.  Long closures have been 
necessary in recent years due to lack of extensive 
monitoring, resulting in the loss of consumer 
confidence in the shellfish product. 
 
California 
 
The first outbreak of PSP recorded in California 
involved 12 people who ate mussels from Timber 
Cove, Sonoma County, in 1903 (Meyer et al. 
1928).  Five of those people died.  The next 
reported cases of PSP were reported from Santa 
Cruz County (4 people) in 1915 and (12 people 
including 2 deaths) in 1917.  An additional case in 
San Diego County was reported in 1918 (Price et 
al. 1991). 
 
Health officials recognized PSP as a serious health 
risk in California in 1927.  Since then, there have 
been over 500 reported incidents, with more than 
30 deaths.  From the 1960s through the 1980s, 
there were toxic events most years along the 
California coast (Price et al. 1991).  The most 
recent recorded death was in 1980, and the last 
reported illness was in 1991 (RaLonde 1996).  
Today, most toxic events occur in the summer and 
fall, and the state imposes an annual mussel 
quarantine of sport-harvested mussels from May 1 
through October 31, along the entire California 
coastline (Price et al. 1991).  The California 
Marine Biotoxin Monitoring Program, managed 
by the California Department of Health Services 
(CDHS), is the oldest HAB monitoring program in 
the United States. 
 
Indians of the Pacific Coast, in the state now 
known as California, would not eat shellfish when 
bioluminescence was evident in ocean waters 
because they were apparently aware of the 
relationship between this event and toxicity in 
98
shellfish.  Meyer et al. (1928) wrote, “From time 
immemorial it has been the custom among coast 
tribes of Indians, particularly the Poma, to place 
sentries on watch for Kal ko-o (mussel poison).  
Luminescence of the waves, which appeared 
rarely and then only during very hot weather, 
caused shellfishing to be forbidden for two days; 
those eating shellfish caught at such times suffered 
sickness and death.  According to a report, a band 
of Indians died about fifty years ago from eating 
mussels gathered on the Mendocino coast during 
the month of August”. 
 
The first documented occurrence of domoic acid 
poisoning on the Pacific coast of the U.S. was in 
September and October 1991, near Santa Cruz, 
Monterey Bay, California.  Pelicans and Brandt’s 
cormorants fed on anchovies that had eaten toxic 
Pseudo-nitzschia (Buck et al. 1992;  Fritz et al. 
1992;  Work et al. 1993).  These birds were found 
dead and dying on the beach.  A bloom of P. 
australis, identified for the first time as a species 
producing high level of domoic acid (Garrison et 
al. 1992;  Villac et al. 1993), was observed in 
Monterey Bay during this event.  Mussels 
collected at this time had concentrations of domoic 
acid that exceeded the federal alert level.  Another 
domoic acid event in Monterey Bay that involved 
illness or death of over 70 California sea lions 
occurred in May 1998.  About one month later, sea 
otters were also sickened by domoic acid.  
Mussels tested for toxin content at the same time 
as this event showed only very low levels of 
domoic acid, indicating that this may not be an 
effective sentinel species for exposure of marine 
wildlife to toxins.  However, mussel testing may 
provide sufficient warning for the risk of toxin 
exposure in humans because no cases of human 
poisoning by domoic acid are known to have 
occurred in California.  
 
Testing 
 
The annual quarantine applies only to recreational 
harvesting of mussels.  Mussels and all other 
bivalves grown and harvested by licensed 
commercial operators in California are subject to a 
separate PSP testing program.  In 1981, the CDHS 
required that commercial shellfish growers submit 
samples from their shellfishing beds at weekly 
intervals, year-round, during all harvesting 
periods.  This requirement was imposed as a 
consequence of a PSP outbreak in 1980, during 
which 61 people became ill from eating 
commercially grown oysters.  All harvesters and 
growers of bivalve shellfish (e.g., oysters, clams, 
and mussels) must obtain a certificate from the 
CDHS prior to harvest.   
 
In addition, county environmental health 
departments submit sentinel mussel samples from 
their regions 1-2 times per month for testing.  This 
voluntary sampling protocol was formulated as an 
agreement between the CDHS and several coastal 
county health departments.  The program first 
involved the northern counties, and later grew to 
include southern counties.  The sampling protocol 
suggested that each county select two sampling 
locations, and submit a sample from each site at 
biweekly intervals during the quarantine period 
and at monthly intervals during the non-quarantine 
period.  However, some coastal county health 
departments have not been able to collect all 
samples as outlined in the sampling protocol.  
Monitoring by coastal counties is augmented in 
some areas by samples collected by the CDHS, the 
California Department of Fish and Game, and 
various other participants.  Domoic acid was 
measured in California mussels in spring 1991.  
Since that time, the CDHS has included testing of 
domoic acid in its biotoxin monitoring program. 
 
An extensive phytoplankton monitoring program 
in California that provides a valuable adjunct to 
shellfish monitoring for PSP toxicity and domoic 
acid was established in 1992.  The benefit of 
phytoplankton monitoring is that many of the 
observations are made in the field, so the lag time 
associated with mussel monitoring is eliminated.  
These plankton monitoring efforts have detected 
the early stages of several toxigenic blooms prior 
to the detection of toxicity in any species of fish or 
shellfish.  California’s phytoplankton monitoring 
sites, sampled at frequencies ranging from once a 
week to once a month, include all commercial 
shellfish growing areas and numerous coastal 
sites.  Over 45 volunteers collect samples for the 
program.  A core group of participants performs 
all the field identifications and communicates 
results with program manager.  Data from this 
program are qualitative because they are based on 
net tows and the assignment of a “relative 
99
abundance” index to each species present in a 
sample. 
 
Seasonality 
 
The two largest PSP outbreaks in California, in 
1927 and 1980, began during July.  The majority 
of PSP cases in other years have occurred during 
the 4-month period from June through September, 
with July being the peak month.  These peaks 
appear to correlate with relaxations of upwelling 
that result in the transport of toxic cells to the 
coast (Langlois 2002).  However, toxic 
dinoflagellate blooms are not limited to the 
warmer months of the year.  Toxic blooms have 
caused numerous extensions of the quarantine 
period beyond October 31, and early-season 
quarantines prior to May 1 have been common in 
recent years.  The geographic center for coastal 
PSP toxins appears to be Marin county in central 
California (highest intensity) with lower levels of 
toxin measured both north and south of this area.   
Domoic acid in shellfish has been monitored since 
it was first identified along the west coast of the 
U.S. in 1991, and no strong seasonality has been 
observed.  However, most domoic acid events 
occur in the spring, summer and fall months.   
 
Results of several years of volunteer monitoring 
by the DHS Phytoplankton Monitoring Program 
suggest that there may also be a northward 
progression of Pseudo-nitzschia from the Santa 
Barbara and San Luis Obispo areas that appear to 
have some of the first blooms of the season (G. 
Langlois, pers. comm). 
 
Highest toxin levels 
 
Mussels have been responsible for the majority of 
California PSP cases and deaths.  The highest PSP 
level recorded was 16,000 µg/100 g mussel in July 
1980, in Marin county.  The highest level of 
domoic acid (2300 µg/g) was measured in 
anchovy in May 1998, at the same time that sea 
lions were observed dead and dying on central 
California beaches (Fig. 34).  During this time, 
measurements of domoic acid in mussels did not 
exceed the regulatory level.  The highest level of 
domoic acid in mussels was measured at 49 ppm 
on the central California coast near Monterey Bay 
in the fall of 1991. 
Causative species 
 
The species known to cause PSP in California is A. 
catenella.  Domoic acid poisoning in California is 
primarily due to blooms of P. australis, although 
other potentially-toxic species, including P. 
multiseries, P. fraudulenta, P. heimii, P. pungens, 
and P. pseudodelicatissima have been observed in 
coastal waters. 
 
Impacts 
 
California has a relatively small commercial 
shellfish industry with about 12-16 companies 
statewide that could potentially be impacted by 
PSP and ASP.  Many of these industries are 
located in bays that are at least partially buffered 
from the immediate impact of toxins that affect the 
open coast.  The annual quarantine for recreational 
shellfish concerns only mussels, therefore clams 
can still be harvested.  Only rarely has toxin in 
mussels increased to levels that require closure of 
the entire recreational harvest on the California 
coast.  Therefore, impacts of toxins on the 
California fishery are relatively small compared to 
Oregon and Washington. 
 
Other organisms 
 
Strongly visible red water discolorations due to 
blooms of Lingulodinium polyedra (=Gonyaulax 
polyedra) are common off the coasts of southern 
California and Baja California.  Although they are 
usually harmless, there have been occasional 
reports of marine fauna mortalities due to 
excessive concentrations, decay, and high 
biological oxygen demand (B.O.D.) on beaches. 
These reports go back as far as Torrey (1902). 
 
Hawaii 
 
Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) is the most 
significant HAB problem in the tropical waters of 
Hawaii.  Incidences of CFP in the eastern Pacific 
appear to be very low, and represent a small risk to 
both human health and the economy.  However, 
ciguatera fish poisoning is an emerging human 
health risk outside the tropics because of 
importation of tropical seafood to areas such as the 
continental U.S and the visit of tourists to Hawaii.

Unanswered questions and hopes for the future 
 
Due to the vastness of the western U.S. coastline, 
with its many bays, fjords, and estuaries, testing is 
expensive and difficult.  It can cost several 
hundred dollars to submit one sample for testing, 
because sampling areas are remote and distant 
from testing centers.  Ideally, a simple, reliable 
test for both PSP and ASP will be developed for 
use at remote sites of harvest.  Currently, an assay 
is being tested in Alaska by Jellet Biotek
®
, a 
Canadian company that specializes in the 
development of “test strip” immunoassays for 
toxin detection.  It shows some promise, but must 
pass the rigorous criterion to avoid false negatives.  
A monitoring tool that would give aquaculturists a 
“safe/not safe” result would greatly reduce the 
number of samples sent for expensive testing at 
state monitoring labs. 
 
Not only does the remoteness of sampling sites 
contribute to the expense of toxin testing, but 
lengthy and tedious extraction procedures add to 
the cost.  A more rapid or automated procedure for 
the extraction of toxins from shellfish would also 
greatly reduce the costs of monitoring.  If a single 
extraction procedure could be used for both 
domoic acid and PSP toxin testing, a greater 
saving of time and money would be realized. 
 
The biggest HAB-related question remaining in 
Alaska is, “which areas have little or no toxin and 
are safe for development of aquaculture 
facilities?”  An extensive study would be required 
to “map” clean sites in Alaska.  The identification 
of these specific sites of little or no toxicity then 
would reduce the amount of testing required, and 
would enable a sustainable resource to be more 
efficiently managed.  Only through large, 
collaborative studies of physical, biological and 
chemical processes that influence HAB initiation 
and development, will areas that are generally free 
from toxic episodes be identified. 
 
In all U.S. west coast regions, if not all regions in 
the world that suffer from HABs, the remaining 
unanswered questions include:  what are the 
environmental factors that initiate and drive  
 
HABs, what environmental factors cause algae to 
be toxigenic, end blooms, and result in no toxin 
production?  What role do cysts and vegetative 
cells play in promoting PSP toxicity?  Answers to 
these questions would assist in more efficient 
management of HABs in all U.S. west coast states. 
 
Hopes for the future include the possibility to 
predict blooms.  Only through large-scale 
collaborative studies, will the answers to the 
questions posed above be obtained.  HABs cross 
borders freely and international studies should 
therefore be encouraged.  For example, toxic 
Pseudo-nitzschia blooms that arrive on both the 
Washington State and British Columbia, Canada 
coasts, are thought to originate at the 
U.S./Canadian border, in an oceanographic feature 
known as the Juan de Fuca eddy.  Only through 
strong U.S. and Canadian collaboration will the 
precise environmental factors contributing to HAB 
initiation at this site be understood.  This 
collaboration must include representatives from 
management agencies, research groups, and 
commercial and subsistence marine farmers in 
order to gain complete insight on HABs that know 
no borders.

On the U.S. west coast, the toxin-producing algal 
species are the dinoflagellate in the genus 
Alexandrium that cause paralytic shellfish 
poisoning (PSP), the dinoflagellate in the genus 
Gambierdiscus that causes ciguatera fish 
poisoning, and diatoms in the genus Pseudo-
nitzschia that produce domoic acid and cause 
domoic acid poisoning (DAP), also known as 
amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP).  Other harmful 
species, including the raphidophyte, Heterosigma 
akashiwo, and the diatoms from the genus  
 
 
Chaetocerus, kill fish at aquaculture sites, but are 
not harmful to humans.  Water discolorations (red 
tides) caused by noxious phytoplankton also occur 
throughout the area. 
 
Only about 25 of the more than 5000 known 
phytoplankton species produce toxins or directly 
cause fish mortalities, while another 20-30 species 
are responsible for other problems, including 
water discolorations, along the U.S. west coast 
(Table 19).

Maps of the United States show the frequency of 
occurrence of each type of toxic syndrome (from 
the WHOI web site, http://www.redtide.whoi. 
edu/hab/) common on the U.S. west coast (Figures 
35-38).  Although some ASP has been measured 
in shellfish along the U.S. east coast, it is primarily 
a west coast problem (detected in shellfish and 
Dungeness crab).  Record levels (297 ppm) of 
domoic acid were measured in razor clams in the 
fall of 1998. 
 
Paralytic shellfish poisoning is found on both the 
U.S. east and west coasts, however, the highest  
 
levels of PSP have been measured in shellfish on 
the U.S. west coast.  For example, levels of PSP 
measured at 13,700 µg/100g in mussels resulted in 
the hospitalization of 3 people and the illness of at 
least 9 people in Washington State during the 
summer of 2000.  The highest PSP concentration 
measured in Alaskan shellfish from 1982-1999 
was 20,606 µg/100 g in blue mussels off Kodiak 
Island.  Each year, the harvesting of shellfish from 
restricted areas results in the illness of people in 
Alaska.  During the years 1973-1995, 70 people 
were sickened due to PSP in Alaska; during 1995-
2000, at least 51 people became ill.  Due to under-
106
reporting of illnesses, or misdiagnosis, the 
numbers of people sickened in Alaska due to PSP 
are likely 10-30 times higher.  The first 
documented case of PSP in North America 
occurred in 1793 when five members of Captain 
George Vancouver’s crew became ill and one died 
after eating mussels (Quayle 1969). 
 
Ciguatera fish poisoning is the most significant 
HAB problem in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Florida.  
Incidences of ciguatera poisoning in the eastern 
Pacific appear to be very low, and represent a 
small risk to both human health and the economy.  
However, ciguatera poisoning is an emerging risk 
outside the tropics because of importation of 
tropical seafood to areas such as the continental 
United States. 
 
Animal mortalities due to toxic and harmful algae 
occur routinely on the U.S. west coast.  Domoic 
acid poisoning in Monterey Bay, California, in 
1991, resulted in the death of seabirds (pelicans 
and cormorants).  These birds fed on anchovies 
that had eaten toxic P. australis.  More recently, in 
1998 and again in 2000, sea lions and sea otters 
have suffered from seizures due to domoic acid 
poisoning.  Several of these mammals also died 
due to their ingestion of toxic sardines and 
anchovies.  Unexplained mortalities of marine 
mammals in the Monterey Bay region due to 
seizures and other neurological problems over the 
past decades, indicate that domoic acid poisoning 
of mammals may be a relatively common 
occurrence. 
 
Farmed fish have also been known to succumb due 
to injury caused by harmful algae.  The diatoms 
Chaetoceros convolutus and C. concavicornis 
have caused the death of finfish reared in net pens 
since at least 1961 (Bell 1961).  Fish death is 
likely due to suffocation from excess mucus 
production by the gills.  The death of pen-reared 
salmon has also been associated with the 
raphidophyte flagellate H. akashiwo since 1976.  It 
has been reported that Heterosigma produces 
superoxide and hydroxyl radicals (Yang et al. 
1995) resulting in fish deaths.

Introduction 
 
Figure 39 summarizes the locations of harmful 
algal bloom (HABs) events registered in Mexico 
during the last 25 years (Ochoa 2002).  Despite 
our efforts, this reflects only part of the actual 
HAB episodes that occurred along the Mexican 
coastline in this period.   
 
The map was prepared using information collected 
from over 100 reports of various Mexican 
researchers describing their observations.  These 
reports are found in different media, sometimes 
difficult to access (Table 20).  Yet, one very 
important conclusion of the information is that 
only in a handful of cases has the nature of the 
toxins, the causative organisms, and/or the 
implicated ecological and socioeconomic impacts 
been studied in detail.  In these records, very little 
information is provided about the conditions that 
triggered the sudden proliferation of noxious 
microalgal blooms along the Mexican coast.  
Analyzing the data displayed in Figure 39 and 
listed in Table 20 together, it can be observed that 
various reports correspond to the same location.  
This does not imply that a given “red tide” event 
was repeatedly reported, rather that such a location 
was hit several times within the studied period.

Also, considering the proportion of detected 
events, it would seem that the Pacific coast had 
more HAB events than the Gulf of Mexico and the 
Caribbean together.  However, this may be just a 
result of more research activity in the Pacific 
region than in the rest of Mexico.  In other words, 
we lack evidence to support the idea that the 
Mexican Pacific shoreline is more susceptible to 
HAB episodes than the rest of the Mexican littoral.  
 
It is also interesting to note in Table 20 that at 
least 39 different dinoflagellate and diatom species 
have been associated with “red tides” in the 
Mexican littoral.  Of these, some are known to 
produce toxins (Table 21) and can provoke human 
seafood poisoning through various vectors (Table 
22).  Following, some examples are discussed. 
 
Amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) in Mexico 
 
HAB events in the Pacific coastline of Mexico 
have been studied at CIBNOR for the last 12 
years.  During this period, not only toxins, but also 
causative organisms in different events have been 
identified.   
 
The most notorious events involved high mortality 
of fish, sea birds, and sea mammals, provoked by 
domoic acid, the toxin responsible for ASP (Ochoa 
et al. 1996, 1997a; Sierra-Beltrán et al. 1997).  
Such events occurred at the tip of the Baja 
California Peninsula and in the upper Gulf of 
California in the winter of 1996, and again in 
1997.  We were able to identify the causative 
organisms as members of the Pseudo-nitzschia 
genus, and in one case, as P. australis (Ochoa et 
al. 1997a).  Because previous records indicate its 
presence in the Gulf of California (Cortés-
Altamirano et al. 1996), and because of its ability 
to proliferate under certain oceanographic 
conditions such as “El Niño” and “La Niña” 
(Sierra-Beltrán et al. 1999), P. australis is a 
suitable candidate for ASP-monitoring in Mexico.  
In fact, time series analysis have shown that a 
cooling trend of the water in the upper Gulf of 
California during the period 1993-1997 (Beier 
1997) could have played an important role in ASP 
outbreaks in this region. 
 
 
Ciguatera toxin (CTX) and diarrhetic shellfish 
poisoning (DSP) in Mexico 
 
DSP has not been acknowledged in Mexico by 
health authorities, although a high incidence of 
undiagnosed, non-infectious, seafood-related 
diarrhea events are found in the epidemiological 
records of the Health Ministry (Ochoa et al. 
1998a).  The presence of toxic species causing 
DSP (such as Dinophysis spp. and Prorocentrum 
spp.) has been well established along much of the 
Mexican littoral.  Therefore, this coastline should 
be considered a DSP risk area.  Incidents where 
fishermen have been poisoned after eating fish 
belonging to the Serranidae and Lutjanidae 
families, at Rocas Alijos (Lechuga and Sierra-
Beltrán 1995), and Isla El Pardito (Heredia-Tapia 
et al. 2002), have been linked to “ciguatera,” 
rather than to DSP events.  Therefore, further work 
is necessary to clarify which toxins are affecting 
the Pacific marine resources.  If CTX at Rocas 
Alijos is confirmed, this will present a new record 
for a northerly latitude at which the risk of such 
fish poisoning occurs.  On the other hand, if this 
event and the one reported at El Pardito Island is 
considered a DSP case, then we can declare that 
DSP is indeed impacting Mexico’s coastal 
population.  As proof, the dinoflagellate 
Prorocentrum lima, associated elsewhere with 
CTX and DSP cases, was isolated from Isla El 
Pardito (Heredia-Tapia et al. 2002).  This isolate 
has been shown to be smaller, different in toxin 
composition (at least two components remain to be 
identified), distinct in toxin profile (dinophysis 
toxin: okadaic acid ratio is 2:1), and is more toxic 
than related species.  All these properties point to 
adaptations to local environmental conditions that 
reinforce the idea of geographic toxic variability 
within the same species.  
 
Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) in Mexico     
 
PSP is also present along the Pacific littoral of 
Mexico (Sierra-Beltrán et al. 1996; Ochoa et al. 
1998b).  In Mexico, all cases of hospitalization 
and human casualties recorded after consuming 
oysters, mussels, or clams, were PSP-related.

bahamense var. compressum have been clearly 
identified as the causative organisms in all cases.  
It is interesting that G. catenatum has a maximum 
distribution from the upper Gulf of California to 
Acapulco, a range of about 13 ° of latitude (2200 
km of coastline), while P. bahamense var. 
compressum has a maximum distribution from 
Costa Rica to Manzanillo, a range of about 8 ° of 
latitude (2200 km of coastline).  Both species 
share a transition zone, between Manzanillo and 
Zihuatanejo, but do not appear to occur at the 
same time.  The southern expansion of G. 
catenatum and the northern expansion of P. 
bahamense are responses to the influence and 
mixing of different coastal currents along the 
western Mexican coastline.  It is noteworthy that 
the majority of G. catenatum outbreaks occur in 
Mazatlán Bay.  This area may be considered as a  
“PSP-spreading center” from which cells are 
carried southward by the California Current.  P. 
bahamense var. compressum, on the other hand, 
seems to originate from a center near Costa Rica 
and is carried northward by the Panama Current.  
The impact of ENSO events has a direct influence 
on the distribution of the two species, which is 
dictated by the mixing zone or front where the 
Panama Current encounters the California Current.  
A deeper study on the links between 
environmental changes and algal physiology may 
shed more light on the causes, distribution, and 
frequency of such noxious blooms.  
 
Marine cyanotoxins in Mexico 
 
The risk of harmful marine cyanobacteria blooms 
in aquaculture has been recognized during several 
incidents affecting the shrimp farms of 
northwestern Mexico in which blooms of 
Schizothrix calcicola were observed.  To 
determine the noxious role of this organism, we 
ran several experiments and found that S. calcicola 
caused lesions in the gut of exposed post-larval 
white shrimp (Litopenneaus vannamei) interfering 
with food absorption.  The exposed shrimp grew 
slower and were more prone to be attacked by 
infectious agents that could induce death (Pérez-
Linares et al. 2002). 
 
 
 
Other fish toxins in Mexico 
 
In addition to suspected DSP and ciguatera cases, 
some fish poisoning events in Mexico are caused 
by tetrodotoxin (TTX) in various tissues of edible 
puffer fish (Tetrodontidae) species.  TTX is not 
produced by harmful algal species but is included 
here for completeness.  Fortunately, poisoning 
cases involving this toxin are less frequent in 
Mexico than in Japan.  At least 5 edible species of 
puffer fish are found along the Pacific littoral of 
Mexico.  About 700 tons are harvested every year, 
and yet only 18 casualties have been registered in 
the state of Baja California Sur in the past 30 
years.  Interestingly, the analysis of the various 
species (Arothron meleagris, Spheroides 
annulatus, S. lispus, S. lobatus and Canthigaster 
punctatissima) revealed that different tissues 
(mucus, muscle, liver, gonad, and intestine) 
possess distinct degrees of toxicity (Nuñez-
Vázquez et al. 2000).  In the case of A. meleagris 
and S. lispus, for example, the toxicity of the 
muscle is so high that its consumption should be 
avoided.  The safest species in this family seems to 
be Spheroides lobatus, yet its mucus tested 
positive for toxin in the mouse bioassay.  A 
conclusion of that work was a suggestion to the 
Fishery Department and Health Ministry to advise 
the population of the risk of eating pufferfish, 
which many consider a delicacy. 
 
Relationship between “El Niño” and the 
pattern of incidence of HABs in Mexico  
 
In the Gulf of California, there seems to be a 
positive relationship between occurrences of El 
Niño events and outbreaks of HAB (Ochoa and 
Lluch-Cota 2001).  In other areas of Mexico, the 
opposite relationship is true.  This is an important 
problem to approach, and additional attention 
should be paid to understand and isolate 
anthropogenic and natural mechanisms underlying 
HABs (Ochoa et al. 1998; Sierra-Beltrán et al. 
1998).

The national reports included here give, for the 
first time, an overview of HAB problems 
experienced by PICES member countries of the 
northern North Pacific and the state of knowledge 
in each.  Although PICES has focused on the 
northern North Pacific (as reflected in the choice 
of the logo for the Organization), HAB 
phenomena do not respect such boundaries.  For 
example, tropical ciguatera fish poisoning occurs 
within the warmer waters of countries such as 
China and the United States and there are tropical 
shellfish poisonings and fish killers that also 
extend beyond the southern limits of the current 
PICES member countries.  To include warmer 
North Pacific waters we have invited scientists in 
Mexico to provide a national report to supplement 
those of member countries.  In the future, we hope 
that other countries within or adjacent to the 
region will be linked by this or similar 
organizations.  Ultimately it is hoped that all these 
will contribute to a synoptic, global review under 
the auspices of the IOC-UNESCO program, 
GEOHAB and the International Society for the 
Study of Harmful Algae (ISSHA).   
 
From the country reports a number of general 
conclusions are evident.  Serious HAB problems 
occur in all member and adjacent countries.  These 
include human health hazards from various forms 
of shellfish poisoning that are not only of similar 
type but are often caused by the same organisms, 
even to the species level.  Before noting some of 
these, attention should be drawn to name changes 
that may confuse the picture.  We allowed the use 
of original species and genus names in the country 
reports.  However the reader should be aware that 
all the toxic Nitzschia species in older literature 
are now in the genus Pseudo-nitzschia (always 
hyphenated), Protogonyaulax species are now all 
in Alexandrium.  Several HAB species of  
 
Gymnodinium are now in other dinoflagellate 
genera such as Karenia (brevis, mikimotoi), 
Karlodinium and, most unfortunately because of 
the potential for genus/species confusion 
Akashiwo (sanguineum).  The IOC has recently 
provided a list of all HAB species and their 
synonyms on its website.  
 
Although taxonomic citation may vary, we know 
that similar species of Alexandrium cause paralytic 
shellfish poisoning (PSP) in all the PICES 
countries.  In warmer waters of both the eastern 
and western North Pacific, tropical members of the 
same genus cause PSP, as well as Pyrodinium 
bahamense var. compressum and Gymnodinium 
catenatum.  Similar species of the diatom genus 
Pseudo-nitzschia produce, or have the potential to 
produce, domoic acid (amnesic shellfish poisoning 
and its counterpart in benthic crustaceans and 
planktivorous fish) in all the member countries.  
The diarrheic shellfish poison producers of the 
dinoflagellate genus Dinophysis are also common.  
Fish and shellfish killers are almost as ubiquitous.  
Raphidophyte (chloromonad) flagellates of the 
genera Heterosigma, Chattonella and Fibrocapsa 
kill farmed fish in areas where there is major 
aquaculture activity, with the latter two genera 
more prevalent in the warmer waters.  The 
dinoflagellate, Noctiluca scintillans, is ubiquitous 
in the coastal waters of the region but only seems 
to be a serious problem when it blooms within the 
confines of shrimp farms, such as those of 
southern China, where its effects can be 
catastrophic.  Some fish killers, such as 
Cochlodinium polykrikoides and closely related 
species, seem to be predominantly problems in 
Korea (where it is the main source of severe 
losses), Japan and British Columbia.  Heterocapsa 
circularisquama is so far only a destroyer of 
shellfish in Japan.

As noted earlier, human illness from ciguatera fish 
poisoning, caused by benthic dinoflagellates, 
primarily Gambierdiscus toxicus, is limited in the 
PICES region to the warmer waters of the U.S. 
and China, such as Hawaii and in the South China 
Sea.  However, it is widespread in other tropical 
countries including Mexico and the Philippines.  
Additionally, the import of fish from tropical 
sources, e.g., Hong Kong, as well as tourist 
exposure while visiting the tropics, causes this 
illness to be more far-reaching to most temperate 
countries.  These facts lend credence to earlier 
assertions that there is no coastal country in the 
world that does not have one form of HAB or 
another, or most likely several.  Cyanobacteria, 
which are the predominant group causing HABs in 
freshwater, are less of a problem in the marine 
environment although microcystins, known only to 
be produced by cyanobacteria so far, have turned 
up in B.C. salmon farms.  Trichodesmium, a 
common and abundant tropical cyanobacterium, is 
not usually harmful but can be if it enters the 
confined waters of shrimp ponds (China and S.E. 
Asian countries) and the Mexican report identifies 
others as being a serious problem in shrimp farms. 
 
Combining the information from adjacent 
countries can provide a much more complete view 
of the scope of HAB problems and may even 
provide insights into important ecological 
questions that would not be apparent form viewing 
one country alone.  In Figure 40 we show the PSP 
data for Washington State alone, and in 
combination with British Columbia for the same 
year.  Not only is the scope of high PSP evidently 
much wider in the combined picture, but it also 
reveals an interesting difference between the outer 
coasts of the two.  PSP is effectively absent in 
1999 from the open Washington coast but 
commonly present on the west coast of Vancouver 
Island.  
 
In order to draw realistic comparisons between 
countries, the standardization of terminology and 
methodologies is of urgent importance, not only in 
the PICES region, but also throughout the world.  
A major discrepancy involves interpretation of the 
term “red tide”.  In some countries this refers only 
to fish or shellfish killers, but in others it may even 
include bloom-forming phytoplankton that are 
non-harmful but are a local economic problem.  
These non-harmful blooms commonly occur in 
other countries but would not be included in each 
country’s HAB reports.  Some countries restrict 
reports of harmful algal blooms to those algae 
known to produce a toxin.  Others distinguish 
“toxic red tides” from non-toxic ones where harm 
can be caused by non-toxic factors such as oxygen 
depletion.  The word “toxin” may have different 
meanings, being synonymous to ingested poison 
by humans in some countries, but in others 
including, for example, the brevetoxins which kill 
fish in Florida.   
 
It is evident that care should be taken in 
comparing lists of “red tide” species from different 
countries and particularly total numbers.  
Similarly, the number of incidents reported may be 
“sightings” rather than ecologically separate 
events and are thus dependant on the frequency 
and comprehensiveness of the observer network 
employed.  Interannual reports can only be 
compared if the observation protocol is the same 
each year.  Such considerations are obviously 
critical to the formation of large, multinational 
databases.  
 
Fortunately the monitoring of PSP toxin levels in 
shellfish employs fairly standard methodology.  
Most countries follow the AOAC mouse bioassay 
method, with a closure level of 80 µg per 100g of 
shellfish meat in nearly all North Pacific countries.  
An exception is in the Philippines where, due to 
the greater concern about very young victims, a 
lower closure level of 40 µg is used.  However, 
there are significant differences in the species of 
shellfish tested.  This is unfortunate for the 
purposes of comparison, since different shellfish 
concentrate different levels of toxin for varying 
lengths of time.  Mussels pick up toxins rapidly 
upon exposure and lose it the most rapidly, 
whereas butter clams, for example, retain PSP 
toxins for long periods of time.  Razor clams retain 
domoic acid for months, whereas mussels depurate 
this toxin quickly.   
 
In some countries, long-term data sets are of 
limited value because the species of shellfish 
routinely monitored has changed with time.  
Increasingly, for reasons of economy and 
convenience, many monitoring programs use 
mussels as “sentinel species”  to  test  for  shellfish

toxins since these are the standard indicators of 
pollutants in “world mussel watch” programs.  In 
most member countries, at least some plankton 
monitoring is carried out.  While plankton 
monitoring programs alone are unlikely to serve as 
reliable methods of protection on a large scale, 
within limited areas, such as those of high 
aquaculture or shellfish harvest, they can provide 
early and supplemental warning and are essential 
for the understanding of the ecology of HABs.  
 
Logistical and financial problems cannot be 
ignored in the management of HABs, given that 
some coastlines such as British Columbia, Alaska 
and northeast Russia are impossible to monitor 
comprehensively because of their length, 
complexity and difficulty of access.  Typically 
blanket closures are issued for these remote 
coastal areas.  Unfortunately, this can have an 
unwanted suppressive effect on the development 
of regional harvesting and aquaculture in 
economically deprived areas.  Local people within 
these blanket closure areas tend to disregard 
management dictates and rely instead on 
traditional folk wisdom.  The authorities, while 
acting responsibly, in fact lose control and respect.  
 
Most reports focus on monitoring and prediction 
efforts in management, but a few have also 
provided information on mitigation efforts, such as 
the use of flocculents to sink blooms or algicidal 
bacteria and viruses as means of HAB control.  
These practical approaches are still in early 
development but clearly need to be encouraged 
where conditions make them feasible.  
 
Interesting and important ecological questions 
arise from reviewing the national reports.  For 
example, PSP appears to be less prevalent north of 
the Aleutians in Alaskan waters and more 
prolonged in northern British Columbia.  The open 
coast of Washington, Oregon and California seem 
to be subject to PSP primarily in embayments 
whereas the B.C. outer coast has plentiful toxicity 
(Fig. 40 above).  Are these observations actually 
artefacts of low sampling intensity or are they 
real?  If so, why?  There is a provocative sequence 
in timing of Pseudo-nitzschia blooms from south 
to north up the west coast of North America (Fig. 
41).  Is this due to a physical linkage, such as

occurrence and maxima of domoic acid on the 
west coast of North America in 1998. 
 
 
subsurface northward advection of toxic cells or is 
it a progressive triggering of local blooms 
following a seasonal progression whose timing is 
later in the north?  
 
Although the primary direction of surface flow is 
southward throughout the summer months when 
these HABs are a problem, the northward reversal 
due to a shallow manifestation of the California 
Undercurrent, known as the Davidson Current, 
could provide northward advection of 
phytoplankton cells.  Related to this is the question 
as to why certain local areas experience blooms 
much earlier than others?  
 
Questions that occupy a central position in recent 
HAB literature are whether HABs are increasing 
in intensity (frequency, abundance and area) and 
spreading to new, previously unaffected areas.  
Some authors unjustifiably seem to assume that 
both are an established fact on a global scale.  
Others argue that factors such as increased 
awareness and local increases in aquaculture 
activity are contributing to false impression of 
environmental change for the worse.  
 
No one disputes that the number of reports has 
been increasing exponentially in the past few 
decades.  Several reports here shed light on these 
important questions.  Some areas have 
undoubtedly had increases in HABs, of which  
 
132
a good example is Cochlodinium blooms on the 
southern coast of Korea.   
 
The Seto Inland Sea of Japan apparently 
experienced a dramatic rise in phytoplankton 
blooms in the 1970s, followed by a decline, but 
harmful blooms remained at a fairly constant level 
throughout.  PSP seems to be cyclic in many 
countries, with particularly bad years often being  
 
strong El Niño years, although a causal link has 
not been established.  These and other important 
and exciting questions will no doubt continue to 
occupy a central position in HAB studies in the 
future.  Multinational reports such as this one will 
provide a larger perspective from which to view 
HABs and increase awareness of the need for 
international co-operation.

APPENDIX C 
 
Annual reports of WG 15 on Ecology of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in the North Pacific 
 
 
2000 Annual report 
 
The Working Group 15 held its first formal 
meeting from 0900 to 1230 hours and from 1330 
to 1600 on October 22, 2000.  The meeting was 
attended by 15 members from Canada, China, 
Japan, Korea, Russia and U.S.A. (Endnote 1).  The 
proposed agenda for the meeting (Endnote 2) was 
adopted. 
 
Assessment of HAB problems in the coastal 
waters of PICES countries (Agenda Item 1) 
 
The Working Group 15 was created to facilitate 
studies in harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the 
member countries of PICES.  This need was 
recognized at the previous PICES Annual Meeting 
in Vladivostok, Russia in 1999.  The WG 15’s first 
task has been to evaluate current knowledge of the 
extent and severity of HABs in these countries and 
to that end representatives of each of the countries 
presented reports summarizing the nature and state 
of knowledge (species, location, intensity and 
consequences) of HABs in their regions.  To put 
these reports in perspective, a few prefatory 
remarks have been made by Prof. F.J.R. (Max) 
Taylor. 
 
In the past few decades the study of HABs has 
become a multidisciplinary field of its own, 
combining taxonomy, phytoplankton ecology 
(nearly all are caused by photosynthetic 
microplankton, with Noctiluca being a notable 
exception), limnology, toxicology, public health, 
epidemiology, economics and aquaculture.  At the 
IX International Conference in Hobart, Tasmania, 
this year, there were 500 participants from 45 
countries.  The scope of phenomena and causative 
organisms has undergone a dramatic expansion, 
leading to a flood of reports that have caused 
considerable concern in most coastal countries.  
HABs can be broadly subdivided into two types: 
those that harm marine fauna and those that cause 
potentially fatal human health problems.  HABs 
can be fundamentally subdivided into those 
harming marine organisms and those that are 
hazardous to humans. 
 
Marine fauna mortalities  
 
Harmful algae can kill fish, seabirds and marine 
mammals, either through oxygen depletion, the 
release of toxins or through food chain transfer 
and accumulation.  This is particularly an 
economic concern in aquaculture operations.  For 
example, the pioneering, successful cultivation of 
yellowtail and red bream in the Seto Inland Sea of 
Japan was plagued by recurring blooms of 
raphidophyte algae, notably species of 
Chattonella.  This also brought the role of 
eutrophication into focus since this has been 
known to produce an increase in HABs.  In the 
PICES region this has been demonstrated not only 
in Japan but also in China and Korea.  Fish killing 
dinoflagellates are also known from the PICES 
region.  Major deaths of seabirds and sea lions 
have occurred in Monterey, California, in recent 
years, and elsewhere whales have died from toxins 
in their food, analogous to human health hazard. 
 
Human health hazards 
 
Humans can be affected by HABs primarily 
through eating contaminated seafood (shellfish or 
fish).  Toxins produced by HAB species are 
accumulated by marine organisms feeding on 
them.  The toxins are primarily neurotoxins 
although gastro-intestinal symptoms often precede 
them.  The toxins act primarily on membrane 
permeability of sodium or calcium.  For example, 
while saxitoxin blocks sodium channels and 
blocks nerve transmission ciguatoxin causes them 
to remain open, resulting in depolarization.  The 
primary forms of HAB-related human 
intoxications in the North Pacific are: 
143
a. paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) caused by 
saxitoxins; 
b. diarrheic shellfish poisoning (DSP) caused by 
okadaic acid, dinophysisyoxin and 
pectenotoxins; 
c. amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) caused by 
domoic acid;  and 
d. ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) caused by 
ciguatoxin, ostreopsistoxin and possibly 
maitotoxin. 
 
These are caused chiefly by dinoflagellates but 
ASP is linked to several species of the diatom 
genus Pseudo-nitzschia. 
 
Summary of the National Reports (Agenda 
Item 2) 
 
The National Reports on currents knowledge of 
HABs problem have been presented by all PICES 
member countries.  These reports serve as the 
baseline on which WG 15 is going to build other 
activities.  The first conclusion to be drawn is that 
all countries have significant HAB problems and 
may be worsening in some.  Japan experienced 
costly fish kills in fish farms in the Seto Inland Sea 
due to chloromonad flagellate blooms, which have 
also been problematic to salmon farmers in British 
Columbia.  The losses have run into the millions 
of dollars.  Korea is plagued by dinoflagellate-
related fish kills as is Hong Kong.  China has 
experienced severe losses from HABs in its 
extensive shrimp farming activities.  
Eutrophication has been implicated in the Inland 
Sea, Hong Kong and Korean localities and shrimp 
farms are inherently eutrophic.  
 
PSP is present in all PICES countries and 
particularly severe in western Canada, Alaska 
(extending as far south as California) and probably 
Russia.  In Japan, PSP appears to have spread 
since the 1970s from the north down both the east 
and west coasts.  In Korea toxicity has been 
known from the south coast since the 1970s.  DSP 
has been recorded in Japan but there are few 
records elsewhere.  Since the symptoms of the 
latter are difficult to distinguish from bacterial 
contamination it is only the presence of okadaic 
acid in shellfish that confirms DSP.  In most 
PICES countries this is not tested for.  ASP is well 
established on the west coast of the United States 
where it has mainly affected seabirds and marine 
mammals.  Ciguatera fish poisoning, found in 
tropical and subtropical reef systems is a 
significant problem in Hawaii, is recorded from 
imported fish in Hong Kong and can be expected 
in offshore South China Sea locations.  
 
Some coastlines, such as the eastern Bering Sea, 
are evidently understudied and field monitoring 
and research in HABs is usually not co-
coordinated between adjacent countries even 
though the phenomena do not respect national 
boundaries. 
 
Recommendations for 2001 activities (Agenda 
Items 3 and 5) 
 
During the next year, WG 15 is planning to 
produce a series of maps showing the location of 
HABs in the PICES region.  The initial maps will 
indicate historic knowledge of all HAB events in 
each PICES country.  Since ICES is also 
producing such maps for its region (including the 
west coast of North America) it seems logical to 
follow the same format so that they can be 
additive, eventually contributing to a global 
picture. 
 
In mid-2000, a questionnaire, based on the ICES 
equivalent, was sent to each country to serve as the 
start of a PICES HABs database.  The suggested 
historical maps should be part of the database, 
which can then be updated by annual event 
reports. 
 
These should be part of the database, which can 
then be added to by annual event reports, as is the 
case in the ICES region.  In addition a 
questionnaire was sent to each country to serve as 
the start of a PICES database. 
 
The Working Group proposed holding (jointly 
with POC and BIO) a session at PICES X on 
“Physical, chemical and biological interactions 
during harmful algal blooms”.  Drs. F.J.R. (Max) 
Taylor (Canada), and Vera L. Trainer (U.S.A.) 
were suggested as potential convenors, and one 
144
more convenor from Asia could be determined 
later, if the session approved by MEQ. 
 
The Working Group also recommended (subject to 
approval by MEQ and Science Board) convening a 
2-day Practical Workshop on “Taxonomy and 
identification of harmful algal bloom species” for 
experienced analysts from each country to ensure 
that all identifications of harmful species will be 
based on the same criteria.  Many of the species 
are common to most of the participating countries.  
It is planned that the workshop will be held at the 
University of British Columbia in Vancouver, just 
prior to PICES X. 
 
WG 15 reviewed the list of organizations and 
programs for collaboration and identified SCOR 
GEOHAB, IOS/WESTPAC HAB, and ECOHAB 
as the highest priority programs for interaction. 
 
Steps toward the co-ordination of research, 
particularly fieldwork, in adjacent waters should 
be encouraged and facilitated.

Russia, western U.S.A. and western Canada.  
Mexico would also like to contribute their report 
to this publication.  The WG 15 requests that 
national reports be published in the PICES 
Scientific Report Series.  The report will include 
an introduction/background (Dr. Max Taylor), 
country reports (these will detail types of HAB 
events, seasonality, earliest dates recorded, highest 
toxin levels, general environmental information, 
comprehensive literature, causative organisms, 
bloom reports including maps, unanswered 
questions, and hopes for future work), summary 
(Dr. Max Taylor), and appendices (to include 
images, scanning electron micrographs, and 
maps). 
 
2. A workshop on Taxonomy and identification 
of HAB species and data management was held at 
the University of British Columbia, October 4-5, 
2001, hosted by Dr. Max Taylor.  Guest speakers 
included Dr. Laurie Connell from University of 
Maine (molecular probes) and Ms. Michelle 
Tomlinson from the National Ocean Data Center 
(HAB database).  Dr. Connell presented a session 
on gene probes that are currently being used 
and/or development for automated HAB species 
detection.  She gave a demonstration of this 
technique and described the pros and cons of its 
use.  Ms. Tomlinson gave a web-based 
demonstration of the HAB database that is 
currently being developed for the entry of 
biological HAB data.  To date, shellfish toxin data  
 
from Washington State has been entered.  Alaska 
and British Columbia shellfish monitoring data 
will be entered by December 2001.  These data 
can be accessed on the web and maps of HAB 
events can be created.  (This work was also 
presented at the TCODE Electronic Poster 
Session).  The intent of the WG 15 is to add HAB 
information into this database from as many  
 
PICES member countries as possible (also 
including Mexico). 
 
3. General recommendations to MEQ  
a. More interaction and collaboration 
between adjacent/contiguous countries is 
desired.  For example, Pseudo-nitzschia 
and Heterosigma projects between the 
United States and Canada could be 
encouraged by PICES. 
b. Monitoring of both shellfish and plankton 
is desired of all countries.  There are 
serious limitations and problems in 
comparison among countries when only a 
single sentinel shellfish species is used for 
monitoring. 
c. Information needs are identified, 
especially from Russia, the northern B.C. 
coast, and northern Alaska.  Monitoring 
projects are required in these areas that are 
generally lacking in HAB data.  
d. Mexico should be included in the database 
project and has expressed a desire to do 
so. 
e. There is the need for a basic taxonomy 
class, especially for young U.S. and 
Canadian scientists (there are taxonomy  
 
146
classes that are offered, but these are 
focused towards scientists from 3
rd
 world 
countries).  This basic taxonomy class 
could be sponsored by ICES and/or PICES 
(perhaps jointly). 
f. Convene a 2-day workshop on 
Development of common standards for 
HAB data prior to PICES XI.  A 
possibility to conduct this workshop 
jointly with TCODE should be pursued.

APPENDIX D 
 
Workshop report on Taxonomy and identification of HAB species and data management 
 
Introduction 
 
The workshop was held over one and a half days 
prior to PICES X, at a venue provided by the 
Botany Department at UBC.  After welcoming the 
23 participants, the convenor, Dr. Max Taylor, 
stated the goals of the workshop, reminding them 
that it was not a training workshop but rather an 
opportunity for analysts to discuss problems 
related to the accurate identification of harmful 
species, uniformity of taxonomy and data 
reporting, management and usage.  The agenda 
included presentations by Drs. F.J.R. “Max” 
Taylor, Yasuwo Fukuyo, Rita Horner, Laurie 
Connell and Ms. Michelle (Shelly) Tomlinson (in 
order of appearance), but provided as much time 
in the laboratory as possible to observe practical 
demonstrations and to microscopically examine 
material brought by the participants. 
 
Presentations 
 
Dr. Taylor used a brief summary of problems with 
fish- and shellfish-killing flagellate species to 
introduce taxonomic difficulties with HABs.  
These include misidentification (Heterosigma  as 
Olisthodiscus in much earlier literature), 
taxonomic priority and usage (H.carterae vs.  
H.akashiwo), recent name changes (Karenia, 
Karlodinium, Akashiwo), species recognition 
(within Chattonella) and the need for infraspecific 
levels of discrimination.  Problems arising from 
the complex putative life-cycle stages and modes 
of nutrition in Pfiesteria, plus difficulty in 
distinguishing it from “Pfiesteria-like organisms” 
which may not be closely related (e.g. 
Karlodinium galatheanum), as well as toxin type 
and source were briefly mentioned.  It is suspected 
that some common (psammophilic) sand 
dinoflagellates having a similar mode of feeding, 
currently attributed to Katodinium, may be closely 
related (Taylor, unpubl.). 
 
It was noted that almost any bloom-forming 
phytoplankter can kill marine fauna if locally 
over-concentrated, leading to plankton death and 
oxygen depletion.  Members of Gonyaulax have 
been commonly involved in this type of HAB 
phenomenon.  The special case of Noctiluca, a 
microzooplankter often included in HABs because 
of numerous kills of fish and shrimp, especially in 
China, was illustrated and discussed.  Only one 
species, N. scintillans (syn. N.miliaris) has been 
morphologically discriminated but more may exist 
and there is a need for genetic studies.  The 
mechanism(s) of death due to Noctiluca blooms is 
unclear although high ammonia levels may be 
involved.  It usually occurs in confined bodies of 
water, such as shrimp ponds.  In passing it can be 
noted that this common, cosmopolitan species is 
often treated in ecological studies as if it was a 
phytoplankter, with possible links to inorganic 
nutrients being sought, but such links can only be 
indirect since its blooms have to follow those of a 
prey species. 
 
The HAB biogeographic picture shows 
extraordinary latitudinal cosmopolitanism, 
including bihemispherism and a general lack of 
true endemicism (except in polar regions) is the 
norm.  This is generally not appreciated by non-
phytoplanktological taxonomists and has an 
important bearing on the significance of supposed 
ballast water introductions.  It is to be expected 
from general dinoflagellate biogeography that, for 
example, it is highly likely that species of 
Pfiesteria will be found in shallow estuaries in 
other countries with similar coastal temperature 
ranges such as Brazil or southern Africa or 
Australia.  Given the present climate of 
interpretation, artifical introduction would almost 
certainly be invoked as an explanation. 
 
Dr. Fukuyo began by illustrating the seven orders 
of dinoflagellates involved in HABS, with most 
HAB species being found in the Prorocentrales 
(e.g., okadaic acid-producing Prorocentrum spp,), 
Dinophysiales (DSP-associated Dinophysis spp.), 
Gonyaulacales (several genera including 
Alexandrium, Pyrodinium, Gambierdiscus, 
Ostreopsis) and Gymnodiniales (Karenia, 
Karlodinium etc.).  He provided plentiful excellent 
149
identificatory aid material to the participants, 
including publications and a CD produced in 
Japan.  In the Peridiniales, the recently described 
Heterocapsa circularisquama requires electron 
microscopy of its scales in order to identify it, but 
it has a characteristic movement when seen alive.  
It has killed oysters and other bivalves in Japan 
but fish in Hong Kong.  The toxin of this 
economically important, recently described 
species is unknown. 
 
Dr. Fukuyo then focussed on the PSP-producing 
genus Alexandrium with more than 20 species 
implicated in this widespread phenomenon as well 
as fish killers.  He used it to illustrate the criteria 
employed in identification (tabulational features 
revealed by calcofluor or iodine staining) and 
visual aids to the identification of the species, 
including a manuscript by M. Yoshida prepared 
for a recent IOC-DANIDA training workshop.  It 
was noted here, as seen earlier by Dr. Taylor, that 
the shape of cells and number of plates change in 
culture.  In particular, chain formation is often 
reduced in culture, resulting in cells more rounded 
in shape.   
 
This was followed, after laboratory material 
examination of dinoflagellates, by Dr. Horner who 
gave a talk on HAB diatoms, focussing on domoic 
acid-producing species of Amphora, Nitzschia  (a 
recently-described benthic species from Vietnam) 
and Pseudo-nitzschia (six species so far).  After a 
brief history of HAB diatom studies on the west 
coast of North America, noting that it is almost 
certain that records of Pseudo-nitzschia seriata (= 
Nitzschia seriata) before the late 1990’s are 
actually of P. australis, focus turned to the 
problems of visually discriminating between 
various toxic and non-toxic species of Pseudo-
nitzschia.  Electron microscopy, SEM or TEM, is 
needed to observe the fine details of valve 
structure needed to discriminate the species.  
Examples of local representatives of well-known 
toxic species were illustrated, including P. 
australis, P. multiseries and P. 
pseudodelicatissima.  P. granii has been isolated 
recently from the open North Pacific Ocean by 
researchers from UBC.  Problems of overlap in 
descriptions and arising from different views 
(valve, girdle) were discussed.  As toxicity varies 
with strains or physiological state within known 
toxic species their mere presence cannot be taken 
as evidence of the presence of toxins in shellfish.  
This is also found in culture.  Even the type of 
chain formation can vary, including the formation 
of Fragilariopsis-like chains.  A fungal parasite is 
commonly seen in wild coastal N.E. Pacific 
populations.  
 
Another problem associated with diatoms in the 
PICES region is the death of farmed fish due to 
physical gill damage by Chaetoceros 
concavicornis and, possibly, Ch. convolutes.  
Earlier records referred only to the latter species 
but Taylor and co-workers have concluded that the 
former is the greater threat, having more 
developed spinulae on the setae.  It is interesting 
that this species does not seem to be a problem, or 
is unrecognized, in other temperate fish farming 
areas. 
 
In the laboratory, Dr. Connell gave a talk and 
demonstration of a commercially available LSU 
RNA sequence quantitative technique for HAB 
species identification (Saigene).  It is almost fully 
automated and can handle large numbers of 
samples.  It is in current use for identifying species 
of Chattonella, Heterosigma, Alexandrium and 
Pseudo-nitzschia (there are outstanding difficulties 
with P. pseudodelicatissima).  In the future, based 
on complete sequences of rRNA, it is likely that 
microchip probes will be developed.  A very 
recent presentation at the 7
th
 International 
Phycological Congress by Linda Medlin and 
European colleagues showed excellent promise for 
discriminating species of Alexandrium. 
 
Other fluorescent probes are used for toxins, using 
labelled antibodies.  ELISA and other antibody 
methods for toxin detection in cells or shellfish 
were not discussed here since this workshop dealt 
with species recognition, but the need for a 
workshop on recent developments in these 
techniques was recognized as a need. 
 
Ms. Tomlinson gave a talk and a web-based 
demonstration of an online HAB Data 
Management System (HAB-DMS), which is now 
available through the National Oceanographic 
Data Center (NODC, U.S.A.) at 
www.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/hab/hab.pl.  A Pacific 
region website has been created and can be found 
150
at www.nodc.noaa. gov/col/projects/habs/ 
pacindex.html.  The FGDC record for the 
Washington State Department of Health PSP and 
Domoic Acid 1998-2000 (NODC #0000559) has 
been completed.  The online linkage can be found 
at www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/sf/. 
 
The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC, 
NMFS, USA) has supplied harmful algal bloom 
datasets to the NODC.  These include data from 
Washington State Department of Health, the 
Alaska Department of Fisheries.  These data have 
been archived and documented using the FGDC 
format and are available in the originator’s format 
through the NODC Direct system 
(www.nodc.noaa.gov/col/project/access/ nodcdir. 
html).  The FGDC metadata descriptions will be 
provided to the Howard Diamond by NODC, as a 
part of a routine transfer of metadata.  These HAB 
data sets have been re-formatted, and are in the 
process of being loaded into the HAB Data 
Management System (HAB-DMS).  Currently, the 
HAB-DMS and web-based interface are being 
migrated to an operational mode.  Therefore, 
sample data, which was loaded into the database 
for testing, are being removed and replaced by the 
current Washington State data sets archived at 
NODC.  
 
In collaboration with Michelle Tomlinson, the 
NWFSC has developed a web-based form to 
facilitate the acquisition of information regarding 
Harmful Algal Bloom reports in Pacific Rim 
countries.  These will be linked to the HAB 
database as another source of HAB data and 
information.  A statement of work is being written 
to describe additional enhancements to the system, 
as well as requirements for linking these HAB 
reports, as well as other sources of coastal data 
sets which reside within NODC, to the system.  
Conclusion and recommendations 
 
There is a need for at least one training workshop 
in which inexperienced PICES phytoplankton 
analysts become familiar with a wide range of 
HAB species potentially harmful in their waters 
(both Dr. Fukuyo and Dr. Taylor have taught 
several of these before, mostly in S.E. Asia).  A 
special workshop to be convened in Japan, next 
October, immediately prior to PICES XI, was 
recommended, and would focus on antibody-based 
toxin detection techniques. 
 
Participation by more PICES countries at future 
workshops, especially countries not present at this 
workshop (e.g., China, Korea, Russia) has to be 
encouraged 
 
The initial entry of HAB shellfish data from the 
western US into the NODC database has been 
successful.  The goals for the upcoming year 
include entry of data from western Canada and 
Asian Pacific countries.  It was recommended that 
Asian Pacific country representatives make 
available their historical shellfish toxin data for 
entry into the database.  There is concern that 
these data may be of a sensitive nature, and not 
desirable for general release to the public.  This 
concern can be circumvented by focusing on 
historical data that is at least two years old.  
Additional funding should be sought to continue 
collaboration of PICES with NODC. 
 
There is a need to continue the development of 
possibly the most useful PICES HAB database.  
Much further discussion of HAB databases is 
required to deal with design and standardization 
issues.  A further workshop on the latter seems to 
be essential.
